As soon as I heard of Karen Huff Klein and what some condom worthy offspring have done to her, i had to create a fundraiser here for this nice lady.

Lets give Karen a vacation of a lifetime, lets show her the power of the Internets and how kind and generous people can be.

I have just created a fundraiser page for Karen:

http://www.indiegogo.com/loveforkarenhklein?a=714358

I have contacted her through Facebook, but she might be at work so might not have gotten the message yet.

If someone can let her know or send me her email so I can forward all the logins and details to her that would be great!

Details:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l93wAqnPQwk&amp;feature=player_embedded

The video above shows the 68 year old bus monitor named Karen Klein being verbally abused by a group of condom worthy middle schoolers from Athena Middle School in Greece, New York.

Through the video you can hear them verbally berating the woman, calling her a bitch, fatass, poor, ugly, and various other words of the like. At one point in the video, you can hear one of the kids yell, “You’re so fuckin poor you fat ass,” in which Karen responds, “I try to live by some of these words, I try and it’s really hard,” which were the words written on her purse. Now, i don't know about you but that was fucking heart breaking. I have no idea why these horrible teens would want to bully a SENIOR CITIZEN to fucking tears, but i feel we need to do something, something that will bring some joy to her life.

She doesn't earn nearly enough ($15,506) to deal with some of the trash she is surrounded by. Lets give her something she will never forget, a vacation of a lifetime!

*EDIT: I removed a previous post in /r/Askreddit due to people telling me its no place for fundraisers so I posted up here.

WORLDTRAVELERONEDAY told me he has her phone number so we will try and get a hold of her asap to let her know and transfer all the details to her. 

*Update 1: Thanks WORLDTRAVELERONEDAY for the number. So i called and left a message, im going to guess she has a LOT of messages by now, but hopefully she calls back.

*Update 2: Thanks razorsheldon! Just called her neighbor, but she said she works for the district also and she is not allowed to say anything and just hung up, i don't want to harass anyone, what should do?

*Update 3: Just contacted WHAM13 news and they will pass on the details about this fundraiser to her and maybe get her in touch with me! Man, i wish i could see her reaction!

*Update 4: 1300$ in 3 hours!!! Thanks everyone you guys rock!

*Update 5: WOOHOO! Goal reached in under 5 hours, you guys are awesome! 

*Update 6: 10,362$ .... holy shit, lets see if we can get her early retirement! 

*Update 7: News picked it up, along with me:

http://www.metro.us/newyork/national/article/1146045--karen-klein-supporters-donate-thousands-for-school-bus-monitor-harassed-by-kids

*Update 8: Just spoke with Amanda, Karen's daughter, and vacation plans are a'brewin! Just so everyone knows, anything above and beyond the vacation cost will go directly to Karen, all of it!!

*Update 9: Transpired has just brought up a good point, will she be taxed on this amount? Can anyone shed some light on this topic?

StylesClashv3 gave a great explanation on taxes, so pretty much she wont pay anything because we have a 5,000,000 limit to the gifts we can give to others, i hope i understood that right.

*Update 10: Ok the people have spoken, all ideas will be with Karen's permission! No money will go anywhere other than her, she has full control of what to do with it.

*Update 11: Just got off the phone with Indiegogo, Im in the process of changing the payment info to Karen's details.

*Update 12: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO STILL THINK THIS IS NOT LEGIT!

I know, i would think the same, but i want nothing to do with the money and my identity has been verified by at least 5 news agencies who called me within these few hours, i have spoke to Karen and her sister numerous times, and with the IndieGoGo team letting them know to transfer the details to her asap. 

Stop making stuff up, ALL THE MONEY WILL GO TO KAREN.

And by the way she will be on Goodmorning America, Anderson Cooper and others tomorrow so watch your local news!

Update 15: [removed]

*Update 15: Thanks everyone, looks like IndieGoGo has been crashed with the Ddos of kindness!!!! 

*Update 16: To all the accusations of me having any monetary gain or anything from this:
I did not know about that fundraiser by case and I never wanted anything in return, ive spent these past two days in phone calls and interviews to bring light to this issue and to help Karen. 

On the other note thank you everyone for your amazing support and help and those who are with Karen!

*Update 17: Wow, its been an absolutely hectic 3 days, I have pretty much been answering calls, emails, and doing interviews all day long for 3 days. I never thought it would be this exhausting. I hope the media blitz will slow down so i can get back to my regular life...

Please Reddit!",gweebah,347,44,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/wzdo4/my_best_friend_caleb_was_shot_in_the_face_during/,"
My name is Michael West, and I am close friends to Caleb Medley and his wife Katie. I was planning to go up to Denver to visit them on Monday, the 23rd and be there for Katie’s induction and birth of their first child Hugo. I was very excited and could not wait to finally be able to go up and visit them for the first time since they both moved to Denver 9 months ago to pursue their dreams. Caleb is a comedian in the early stages of his carrier, and moved to Denver with his wife Katie for better job opportunities and to have better chances of making it big as a professional standup comedian. Katie, who I have known since I was 4 years old, is well on her way to being a veterinarian technician like she has always wanted. She is currently still in her program, but should be graduating in 1 ½ years. Caleb and Katie started dating in high school in their senior year October 31st, 2007 and got married October 31st, 2010 up in the mountains with only family and close friends. I was one of Caleb’s grooms’ men, along with his two younger brothers Seth and Jon. From when they started dating, you could just tell that out of everyone in the world, these two were meant for each other, and at the wedding, you knew it was official, and they would be happily married for eternity. They have been inseparable since that beautiful morning in the mountains, and their love has only grown for each other since. 9 months ago, they decided that it was time to start a family. Katie is now 40 weeks pregnant and was scheduled to be induced on Monday so they can finally meet their little boy, Hugo. Yes, they found the name from the guy from Lost, but it is a very appropriate name. They love the show, and Caleb kind of looks like Hugo in my opinion.
 
On Thursday night, at the midnight premiere of the new Batman movie, Caleb and his wife and a few friends went to go see the new movie. They were all very excited and huge batman fans; they were all dressed in their favorite batman memorabilia, and sat within 15 feet of the emergency exit where the shooter entered. About 15 minutes into the movie, the terrorist came in and “did what he came to do” according to CNN. Katie told me he came in through the emergency exit at the bottom right of the theater, and threw something over their heads. “I thought it was a prank at first, or someone playing along with the movie because it happened during a fight scene.” Katie told me. “Then he opened fire, and Caleb was shot in the right eye as they all tried to duck in cover. “I thought he was dead, because there was so much blood, but he was still moving, and he kept running his fingers through his hair.” Katie and her friend Ashley were staying down right next to Caleb until the shooter left the theater. Within minutes the police was taking people out of the theater, “Caleb was the 4th to be taken out, they did not bother to wait for the ambulance, he was put in the back of a cop car and they drove him straight to University hospital. I did not get to see him again because the police was keeping me, and I did not find out if he was still alive until they released me at about 4 am.

Caleb is now in the ICU, on the ventilator, the surgeon told us he will be in the ICU for one to two weeks if not longer, and is fighting for his life. He has been to surgery twice already, has received over 4 liters of blood, and must go back to get his right eye removed and the pellets from the shot gun removed. Caleb is a friend, a husband, a son, and about to be a father. Caleb and his family have no insurance, and these hospital bills are going to be well into the hundreds of thousands if not millions. Caleb and Katie will be struggling with these hospital bills for the rest of their lives. So I ask anyone who can donate anything, to please do so for these marvelous people that do not deserve any of this that happened to them. If you cannot donate, please spread the word for Caleb, his family, and all the other victims from this horrible tragedy. If you would like to talk to me, and ask any questions, please feel free to do so. My number is 719-369-7208.

Sofia has infantile scoliosis and her Dad is trying to raise money to bring the equipment for her treatment to Peru.

If you can help, WONDERFUL.  If you can't, please copy and paste the below to help make Sofia's campaign viral.  Her dad is trying to raise money to bring Mehta casting equipment to Peru to treat Sofia and others with infantile scoliosis.  

I don't personally know her Dad, but I read about what her Dad is trying to do.  I exchanged e-mails with him and he said that she needs her next treatment by March 15, that if her cast is removed, her spine will revert to 55 degrees from the 35 degrees it is currently at. 

All the information is below.  You can copy and paste this to share.  I previously posted about Sofia on Reddit here as well:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/181p9g/redditorsplease_help_sofia_3_yearold_with/

Thank you....Javacat

&gt;My 3 years old daughter is fighting Progressive Infantile Scoliosis and we are making it together! We found a treatment called Mehta Casting (w/no surgery). A nice doctor from Mayo Clinic took us there for a 1 time application (she needs 4 more) and her spine curvature was reduced from 50° to 35° and she is doing a lot of progress.

&gt;We sent her doctor to the Cincinnati Children's Hospital to be trained by Dr Peter Sturm (another successful experience) and we are working really hard to bring this life saving technique to our country ""Peru"" and all we need now is to buy the special frame that is made in the US.

&gt;We have set up a Paypal account to receive donations. Once we reach our goal (USD 12,500) we will buy the frame and will send it to ""Hogar Clinica San Juan de Dios"" the biggest Charity Hospital in Peru where my daughter and many other kids could receive the same treatment here in Peru.

&gt;Mehta Casting has the real potential to save children life...the same way it is doing it now with Sofía.

&gt;We just need that extra push to achieve our goal....You can help Sofía and kids in our community.

Sofia needs her next treatment by March 15th.  If she can't have the treatment, once her current cast is removed, her spine will revert to it's former curvature of 55 degrees (currently at 35 degrees after the first treatment).  We have raised $1,415 and only need $11,085 to pay for casting equipment.  Once it's paid for, it should arrive in Peru within 30 days.

so i am mostly unemployed right now ... and was doing lots of stuff for a close friend not the the fliped me the finger .. there was trade involved but being a little depressed i was feeling a little used .. but i was ok ...  the morning after i finished that job i saw on my face book page where my so called freind had a vidio of his photo shoot of his sculptures ... it was in the excat location i had taken him and in the same lighting i had said we would shoot in .. HE totally used every thing i said and every thing i would do but he cut me out ... I am sure he seemed like a fucking genius to all the people he had helping ... but the core idea and how to do it was me .. It is something i can not get back nor really claim but it was me... I felt so used ... i know this does not fit what some people were thinking ... but i got used and it hurt me so deep i can not explain ... i was hoping when i helped him i could expand my circle of friends .. but nope he is the sort of fellow to take from you and show others how great he is ... fuck him ... if yall are wonding what i do .. i am a photographer here is a photo i did for /r/trees a long while back .. http://imgur.com/a/O7Y0D",,False,,t5_2s25d,1361487705.0,,,True,t3_18wbif,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/18wbif/self_post_i_feel_very_used_and_thrown_away/,

My girlfriend and I visited London some months ago. Our daughter fell in love with a small stuffed monkey in the Rainforest Cafe. We bought it and since it has never left her side. 

Unfortunately the monkey has been ..misplaced. We are absolutely clueless where we left it and our daughter keeps calling for it. We are looking for someone located in London who can fetch us some 'spare' monkeys. 

You will be sending them to The Netherlands, of course we will compensate all costs and make sure you can buy something tasty for yourself as a thank you afterwards. 

It's a small monkey, I have attached several pictures of the monkey and our daughter here: http://imgur.com/a/KqteV

The Rainforest cafe is located at: 20 Shaftesbury Avenue

Hope you can help us out. 



Edit: We know we should've been more careful with keeping an eye on the monkey. It gets dragged all over the house and even outside to visit friends. The idea of this is that we will be able to return (replace) the monkey when it gets lost or damaged in any way.

My mother’s health, both mental and physical, is not good and I’ve been trying to take care of her as best as I can. 


She is currently on disability CPP (Canadian Pension Plan) but only receives $900 a month which is not enough to cover her mortgage, strata and actually feed herself. I’ve been doing my best to support her financially, but there is only so much I can do as I don’t make a lot of money. 


Our solution is to sell her house so that she can move to the island and I can then only support one house hold instead of two. What little proceeds we’ll get from the house, will be used to pay off my student loan debt so I have more funds to support her with. 


There are repairs, clean up and painting that need to be done that she cannot do on her own due to her health. I’ve had a Handy Man and a professional “Home Dresser” Come in and give their assessment and both say it’s really bad and both have assured me that the house will not sell without this work being done.
 

This is a 3 bedroom 1.5 bathroom townhouse.


Work that needs to be done:


* Cleaning; not only is there smoke damage from her chain smoking in the house but it’s also fairly cluttered, we need to get rid of a lot of stuff.
* Wash the walls and ceilings in preparation for painting.
* Moving of furniture for the preparation of painting.
* Installing of laminate flooring tiles on the 2nd floor and stair way.
* Cleaning of furniture, bathrooms and kitchen.
* Priming and painting the walls.
 
I have 2.5 days to get this work done on the **August long weekend (Aug 3-6th)** as it’s the only time I can get off of my job and travel to Vernon BC from Victoria BC where I live.

I currently have 4 people traveling with me that weekend to do all of the work stated above, and I worry that it’s not enough.
 
**I’ll accept any and all offered help.**


* Live close by or willing to travel? I’d love the extra hands. I can feed people for the weekend.
* Donations. I can’t afford to pay anyone back, but if you donate funds will go towards cleaning supplies or feeding people who are working. If I raise $2600, I can hire the Handyman (see quote) to come and do the flooring, painting and repairs.
* Upvotes! They help too! If I raise more than that, I’ll dress the home in the hopes we can sell it faster.
* Suggestions! Do you know of resources we can tap to get the help we need? Ideas? Tutorials on how to best get the job done for a bunch of amateurs?
* Seriously anything, have old painting supplies you don’t need? Or anything else we can use? I’ll take them!
 
If you help, you’ll be helping get my sick mother out of poverty and living with somebody who will actually care for her well being.
 
If anybody wants extra information or proof please let me know, I’ll provide anything I can and tell you everything you want to know. However personal details I'd prefer to answer in PMs rather than leaving that info out in the open.

It's pathetic, but his grand-daughter is trying to raise the funds to buy it back from her mother to give to him.
A 91-year-old man wants to stop his daughter from evicting him from the home he built 56 years ago in Zaleski, Ohio, a small community south of Columbus.
In 2004, John Potter and his wife, who has since died, gave the general power of attorney to his daughter for future matters if they declined in health, including to take care of her autistic adult brother, now 63.
But unbeknownst to Potter, his daughter Janice Cottrill eventually used that power to convey the deed to the one-story home to herself. In 2010, Potter said he learned of the deed transfer and switched power of attorney to his granddaughter, Jaclyn Fraley, now 35.
Potter, a World War II veteran and retired train dispatcher for the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, sued to get the home back, arguing that his daughter had transferred the deed to herself illegally because those with the power of attorney are not permitted to transfer assets to themselves from the estate they oversee.
Potter won in Vinton County Court, but an appeals court ruled last year that the statute of limitations of four years had passed on the accusation of fraud and thus the deed could not be handed back to Potter.
Early this year, his daughter and her husband sent Potter an eviction notice, saying they had terminated his ""existing lease."" An eviction hearing will take place on June 12, during which the judge will have no choice but to evict Potter, Fraley told ABC News.

Recently we had a gang shooting in which an innocent bystander was struck and killed. He was shopping with his 8-10 year old daughter for his wife's birthday present and was struck and killed by a stray bullet. I was the first person who reached him after he was hit and his daughter screamed. I at first thought he had had a heart attack because he was gripping his chest but as his body went limp and his arm fell away I noticed the bullet wound. Luckily a nurse was near by shopping and began administering CPR. I scooped up his daughter and ushered her away trying to calm her.

My mother has reached out as a psychotherapist to her for some pro-bono work now but she will need years of help. A fund has been set up for her assistance and I am seeking Reddit's kindness to help her and her family through this tough time.

I don't know if this is the right subreddit, if not I hope you all can forgive me, I just want to get her as much help as possible.

Since her passing, I've had problems with them associated relationships that she had with various persons, mainly her (already-married) boyfriend at the time. Not to discredit their relationship, they were living together almost a decade but he's not a person I desire to carry on the least bit of a relationship with.

That said, to make a long story short... I have requested that my mother's Facebook account be ""memorialized"" many times over. I've provided proof of her death as well as proof that I am immediate family. Because they have failed to ""memorialize"" the account over months and months I started trying to report the page as fraud. This too has gone unanswered.

About a month ago i received an email from Facebook stating ""Thanks for taking the time to report this to us. We're sorry to hear you're experiencing an issue using Facebook. While we aren't responding to every report, we may reach out to you for more information as we investigate this.""

I have heard nothing and now when I submit more inquires the site simply says that I have already submitted a report. This is a legal issue at this point and the fact that this man can access my mother's Facebook to gather details about my life is offensive. How I deal with my mother's death should be on my own terms. The thought that I would have to block my mother's account (that has wonderful photographs and memories) because a company as large as that can not complete the measures they themselves put in place makes me feel sick.

I've tried what I can and at this point I'm starting to feel it's hopeless. I'm reaching out to Reddit in hopes that with enough voices they might take notice.

But a new medication seems to have addressed the problem but there is not an employer who will touch me. I have tried everything. Even in a good economy they wouldn’t hire me.

I swear I am an awesome employee and always bring good things to the company I work for.  I am highly skilled at public relations, fund raising, event planning and execution, writing and have done everything from carpentry to running a banquet department for Hilton Hotels. I have two Bachelor’s degrees. One in public relations and journalism and the other in Radio/Television with a marketing minor. Regardless I am willing to work in almost any field doing any job with maybe the exception of being a telemarketer.

My last job was ten years ago as a box boy but in three months I was handling their event planning and public relations but a seizure ended that. I live in Orange county California, about 10 miles from Disneyland.

I am okay financially for the time being but that could change at any time. Currently I take care of my 89 year old mother. When something happens to her I most likely would end up on the street. I need to do something now to make sure that doesn’t happen.

If you have a job for me, **I promise I would be a stellar employee and an asset to your company.** I offer the work I do here on r/assistance the last few years as an example. I take my responsibilities seriously. All I ask for is the chance to take care of myself.

If you don’t know of something now but hear of something later, please keep me in mind.

[Imgur album of cards and the visit](http://imgur.com/a/l2ODb)

So after getting the first batch of cards from around the world, I sent a box of about fifty of them as a surprise. She absolutely loved them and spent the entire day reading them with her magnifying glass.

Later, I was exchanging messages with a Redditor [Charitythebestpolicy](http://www.reddit.com/user/charitythebestpolicy) who was sending a card, and he asked if I was able to visit her again. When I said that it wasn't likely (I'm a barista and airfare is...expensive) he generously offered to make it possible for me to see her again and hand deliver the rest of your cards. 

A couple of weeks after that, I was on her doorstep, and I asked her to go outside and see if the other box I sent had been delivered. She opened the door a few minutes later, looked down to where a box would have been, then looked up to see me. I didn't give her a heart attack, so that's good, and we went inside to read cards and catch up the rest of the day, and the rest of the week. 

She got chocolates from Poland, Pineapple Lumps from New Zealand, hand knitted creations, handmade cards, and hellos from all around the world. My intention was to help her feel connected to the rest of the world when at times it can feel far too small, and you all helped me accomplish that with flying colors. 

I hope you all get to see your cards made it there safe, and thank you so so much.

**Helpful, non-judgemental comments only**

As all of you know, Assistance is about helping. If you think OP has made poor life choices, is stupid, etc., don't try ""not to be harsh"", just keep it to yourself.

Comments should only be about offering solutions or support. Important sidenote, some radical solutions, like ""get an abortion"" or ""drop everything and move to Africa"" cannot be proposed to people you have never talked to and know nothing about. 

**No more obvious advice**

Advising OPs to eat ramen, move to a smaller apartment or sell all their possessions is not helpful. People who come here for help have all envisaged these options and forcing them to justify themselves for not biking 100 miles a day to get to work or not moving to a cut-throat part of town leads to nothing but preaching and self-deprecation.

OK. Saturday morning a kid I took under my wing through coaching him in baseball because of his shitty home life. His hous caught fire and is completely gone on Saturday morning (News link below). This kid has seen tragedy after tragedy man. He is a smart kid and deserves so much better. I just got off the phone with his mom, who insisted I just keep him. He lost all of his clothes, his 360, his tv, all of his baseball gear, his game collection and his collection of cards just to mention a few. He is a kid man. So here I am reaching out to anyone and everyone. Notice I am not using a throwaway for validity reasons. I would like this to get visibility. Any ideas or cross posts. I want to help him out as much as I can. I can ensure you, he will make a video thanking everyone and everything will be going to him. Please help me help this poor kid. I have all of his sizes and such if needed. PLEASE REDDIT COME THROUGH FOR THIS KID!!!

  * UPDATE: I am at work. When I get a few moments I will respond to everyone. You guys seriously rock. Thanks you so much. THE BOY is a great kid and does not deserve this bowl of crap life handed him. 

  * UPDATE: I just walked in the door, my phone died on the bus. We have running and everything tonight. (The Boy) and I will sit down and answer all of these at roughly 8:30PM AZ time. I can not say thank you enough. For those that think there is something in this for me, you are dead wrong. I do not even want a pat on my back, you know why? Because we are human beings, and when one of us needs help we should do our best to try and help, even if it is encouragement or words. That is what we are supposed to do. THANKYOU GUYS!! Talk to you soon. 

  * UPDATE: I just got into work and I will be able to go through Reddit. Last night we were very busy. 2 kids had games, Pepe (as I call him) hung out and watched. We did not get home until 9:00PM at which point it was homework time. Tonight we have nothing going on aside from painting his room. I will go through what I can here and answer everything. After work 4PM AZ time, I will have him setup and account and he can answer some stuff too. Again, I would like to say a big heart felt thank you. The response so far has been overwhelming. We will go through and answer each and everyone of these. To answer everyone about if I have kids or not, yes I do, I have 4 kids 6yo girls, 8 yo boy, 13 yo girl and 14 yo girls (she goes to school with BOY, they have been friends and he has been hanging with us since we moved her 3 years ago.
 UPDATE: My wife is going over and taking pics now. He is in school and than he has track until 4, I am doing my bets at replying to all now.
 UPDATE: A lot of people are sending me nasty grams. Sorry man, I am working. I promise we will go through these this evening. For further proof (I don't know how much this helps) I posted a response in ABC 15 using real name. Feel free to friend me on FB as well, u will see it is posted there too. I also posted using real information to Reddit Phoenix. How idiotic and callus would I have to be man? I would also think that this would be criminal if faked / duped. It is fraud, plain and simple.

  * UPDATE: Sorry it has been a day. We were extremely busy yesterday. I am reaching out to community resources as well, that stuff does not happen overnight. In the mean time I just wanted to help this kid, and to be honest, I did not know what to do, so I did the one thing I know, Reddit. There is a reason I used all my real information and not some throwaway. If you look through this thread and look at a link or 2 I posted, it will not be too hard to figure out my real information. Google the hell out of me, I have not been shy about leaving a foot print. But just understand I am trying to do something good here. By the way he is 13 (he just says hes 14 because his bday is in July. To answer some emails and such I have gotten this. ""Why are you doing this, what do you get out of it""? I hit on this before. You know when you see a car broken down at an intersection, and everyone is just laying on their horn, you know that one guy, the small one, who jumps out and help the person push it to safety and check on them, that's me. That guy who notices u dropped you wallet or card and I immediately get you attention, that's me. I see someone down I help them out. If I se someone getting bullied or taken advantage of, I step up, all while everyone around just sits and rubber necks. I am the guy who still tell you to have a great day, I hold the door and say please and thank you. I have respect for authority and my elders.
 Another reason. I had an alcoholic lush of a mom who walked out on me when I was 6, she left my ""Dad"" to raise and take care of 3 growing boys and 2 step kids that weren't his. He stepped up. With that sai, it got to him. He drank himself to death. By the time I was 15 he had knocked out half my teeth. I moved out on my own at 16 years old, I moved to the UP to try and finish high school. As I remember parents weren't so understanding and were not fast to accept me. I was staying in garages, sneaking in windows, all so I could go to high school every day. I have had nothing in my life handed to me. I lied when I was 16 so I could work nights at the foundry, yes at 16. It was then I realized I had this skill nobody else really had, I could rock a computer, it just all mad sense. So that's how I made myself. My wife and I do NOTHING on credit (Probably really cause we couldn't get it if we wanted as that all went to hell in my twenties when I was trying to survive). MY Mom did eventually come back and we made a menz when I was 17, she tried to help with everything she could. My dad, I would go years with out seeing him. I did not even visit him on his death bed, a regret I hold still. So you asked why are you doing this? I really do not know, maybe it is my past, maybe it is my need to help all the time, maybe this kid just has something special and deserves so much more. Google me to hell Mike Slomanski. 

With all that said here is what we received so far from Reddit: 
* Dominos Gift Card from AstroZombie138 (Thank you so much, having dinner delivered and paid for last night helped more than you know)


I know we have gotten offers, but we have 1 car, I take the bus to work, Like most of you we live pay check to paycheck, which we are between atm. So picking stuff up is very hard, I will try to arrange a day this week. I am open to suggestions. I am open to people stopping by to meet him personally. We are a close family, I have 4 kids of my own. We have normal family problems, for those who google mapped me, I RENT, which I am 1 month behind on, as a matter of fact I think I am behind on every bill. Again we do not do credit, and I am by far your typical Scottsdale DBag. I live on the other side of Shea, by the res. The schools are great there.

What we got from Neighbors and me:
* I got him a futon and air mattress to sleep on
* An old CRT 24"" TV I picked up at a rummage
* 1 pack of boxer briefs 
* 1 Pack of socks
* A Pair of shoes 1 size too big
* A neighbor gave him $50.00, he snuck it to his mom
* A bicycle I fixed that was laying around.

  Now as you can all see, we aren't coming out like ""Bandits"". If THE BOY gets an overabundance of items, I am open to suggestion. I personally would say donate it a Teen shelter in Reddits name, but that is yet to be seen or known.  
 Of course I know how generous Reddit could be, if I did not think this kid deserved it, I would not have come to you guys. Also, he did manage to get his baseball gear, it was in my trunk the entire time. Another question I get asked, does he have his own room? Yes, and he needs his own space. I have given him structure and set expectations, he seems to like that.

What could he use: 
* Teenage boy stuff, he love video games, he likes to read, he like to go out and be active 
* Toiletries (You know like Axe, deodorant, soap, shampoo) 
* He could use a pair of shoes that fit (10) 
* Sizes are 32x32, Large shirts, 10 Shoe and Large BBall shorts. 
* Clothes are always good * Games, outdoor stuff, idk really. 
* He loves baseball 
* I really want him to play RISK, I think he would love it. 
* I know he doesn't need it, but I would like to see him get something fun to pass time and take his mind off. I am not asking for brand new things. If you have a console and some games that just collect dust or something , that would be great for the kid. *Any thing else you guys can think of 
* Like I said I live paycheck to paycheck and now have a family of 7, so yes, things like food, gas card, electric cards are a big help at the moment (I always give back) In lieu of cash I would ask you send him gift cards or something, although I guess cash couldn't hurt, I just don't want to see him sneaking it to his Mom. * Anything else you can think of for a 14 yo boy (He finally told me yesterday (I am 13, I turn 14 in July, I just say I am 14) * I have an old ass XBOX but it has the Red Ring, I have some older games too, if anyone knows how to fix it, that would be awesome too and he could just have it.

I do not want to put a picture, after speaking with a Crisis Officer at the PD he and I both agreed I need to keep as much personal information of his off of here. If you want to meet him while u drop something off, he will gladly meet you and say thank you.

Again My Name is Mike Slomanski, google it, did the dirt, I do not care, nor do I have anything to hide. I am trying to do what is right and what I would hope anyone else would do. 

If you want my addy or phone number just message me or hit me on FB. Thanks again everyone, sorry for the novel and lack of response yesterday.

The employees obviously didn't mind him there, and since we are from the Midwest it is COLD outside, so he was obviously trying to warm up.  I smiled at him as I passed, and he smiled back warmly.  A very young mother walked in behind me with her two small children and boyfriend/husband.  Without even pausing, she turned to him and asked ""Will you be here awhile?  I'd like to buy you a hot meal.""  He seemed stunned, but nodded and smiled.  I admit, I was pretty surprised too.  It was quite obvious that she didn't have a lot of money, especially considering her two young kids.  

I saw her checking out and I just had to help out, so I offered to pay for some of her groceries.  She grudgingly let me, and she seemed extremely modest when I told her that what she'd done for the homeless man was phenomenal.  I passed the man on my way out, already enjoying a cup of soup with a sandwich and a cup of coffee.  I handed him a package of hand/foot warmers and wished him happy holidays.  His smile was beautiful, and it made my eyes well up with tears.  Sorry for the long story, assistance... I just thought that everyone should hear something good this time of year and maybe inspire them to pay it forward to someone nearby.

1347295461.0,122,self.Assistance,znr98,"My son was recently diagnosed with a debilitating cognitive disorder known as Angelman Syndrome. He'll likely never talk, or fully understand it when I tell him I love him, but there is a non-money way that you can help him come a tiny step closer to this possibility.",spoof986,136,14,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/znr98/my_son_was_recently_diagnosed_with_a_debilitating/,"Hi Reddit,
So, I’m Chinese. I live in Canada, but was born in Jamaica. I’ve lurked reddit for 4 years, only creating an account a year ago in an unsuccessful attempt to personalize my front page before deciding that I wasn’t quite as annoyed with the endless posts to WTF, atheism and politics as I thought I was. I’ve never commented on a post; in fact, I’ve never even voted on a post but I have BaconReader on my phone and I stalk the site a dozen times a day and am thoroughly enthralled by American politics.

That’s who I am, but more importantly I wanted to introduce you to my son, Casey. Here’s a picture of him:

http://imgur.com/Xr3op

He was recently diagnosed with a very rare disorder known as Angelman Syndrome, aka ‘Happy Puppet Syndrome’. The short of it is, he’ll likely never speak. He’ll suffer from extreme learning disabilities which will severely limit his ability to communicate, and even to understand communication directed at him. He has real issues with gross and fine motor skills, with most kids with Angelman Syndrome not learning to walk until much later in life, and some not at all. He will likely suffer from several seizures over the course of his young life. I love him with all my heart, and it’s killing me here to itemize the things that have devastated my one year old son like this.

If you’re interested, here is a post that I made on Facebook to inform my extended friends and relatives about his condition, reposted on my wife’s little used blog for those of us without a FB account:

http://cisforcaseyl.blogspot.ca/

Anyway, I’m actually not here to ask for money. After summoning up the will to actually start looking into how to care for my Angelman child, and not breaking down every time I saw the phrase ‘severe mental retardation’, I discovered that research is actually being done in finding therapy to alleviate or rescue the symptoms of Angelman Syndrome. Given it’s rarity, the funding for any kind of research into this is limited, to say the least. The cureangelman.org foundation is almost entirely privately funded with every dollar going to the search for a cure or therapy for children like Casey. It’s a rare condition, but it’s a devastating one that, apparently, has a real shot at being cured.

If you’re interested in seeing why this is different than other similar-type disorders such as autism and cerebral palsy, which (rightly) receives several orders of magnitude in funding over Angelman, check here:

http://cureangelman.org/what-hope.html

One of the most prominent symptoms of Angelman Syndrome is the disposition of the child. Given a general lack of development and understanding, he remains in an extremely happy state often laughing uncontrollably at little things that amuse him. That being said, he often cries his eyes out in desperation because of his inability to communicate when he needs something - food, drink, or even if something has startled or terrified him.

So again, I’m not asking for your money, even though money is something that is desperately needed by cureangelman.org and FAST (Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics). Chase Bank currently has a contest on Facebook where the top vote getter receives 250k in funding for their cause, and FAST is currently around 6th or 7th. I know we hate letting Facebook apps into our FB ecosystem, but it’s for a really good cause. If, and when a cure is found and by some profound miracle I’m able to hear the voice of my Casey, I’ll post as many videos as you want of him saying whatever comes to the Reddit hivemind. I have a three year old right now, actually, who’ll do that for you now if it’ll help to motivate.

Here’s the link to vote:

Thanks Reddit, with your help I really, really believe that you can give voice, hope, mobility and a life back to this community. Conversely, if you have any questions that you’d like to ask me about Angelman Syndrome, I’m happy to share what I’ve amassed over the last few days as far as knowledge goes. And since I know Reddit is chock full of science-y types, I’d be really happy to hear from anybody with a better understanding of what’s going on in the research world.

UPDATE

Dan sends his thanks!!!

&gt;I’m literally overwhelmed by the generous response from friends, acquaintances, and strangers to my posting asking for gas. I’m just now in a place a few towns away from home with internet access, so I literally haven’t started reading all of your posts. I’ll respond and thank you all individually when I’m better able, but I’m very grateful for your thoughts and concrete steps to help alike. 
&gt;
&gt;I now have enough gas for a couple more days, and there are some solid leads on getting more. 
&gt;
&gt;I can now reliably receive texts and maybe voice mail. Outgoing texts were practically impossible to send until today, and it’s now hit or miss, but I can probably return a message within a few hours. For the first time since the storm I was briefly able to receive emails on my phone this morning, but wasn’t successful in sending any emails . I’m still not able to make or receive voice calls, or use the web.

If you'd like to help you can fund a whole outing or just a part - just let me know!  THANK YOU for considering us!  These kids are so special and they deserve something good this summer!

In 2003, I lost my father to a brain tumor and it torn my family apart. We took that day by day and tried to stay strong as a family. I then joined the military in 2008. I am currently stationed in Germany and got a phone call from my mom saying that my brother had shot himself. As I was freaking out, I call my supervisors and then was put on emergency leave and arrived here in Hoschton, Georgia two days ago. My mom is completely wrecked and I'm definitely not doing so well myself. Today we went to the funeral home and discussed the finances and found out that it would be $5,314.00. Right now we are trying to figure out ways to come up with the money. So here I am, asking for some kindness from the reddit community to see if you can help at all. If you can help at all, it would mean the world. If you can't help, that's fine. I just figured I'd give this a shot..

I apologize for this being so long, but there's a lot to my story.

Being the type of person I am, I hate to ask favors of anyone, but in this situation, I'm desperate and I don't know what else to do.

Ten days ago my beautiful two-month old son passed away.  He had awoke around 6am hungry and my girlfriend got up to feed him.  She laid down on the couch while feeding him as she had done hundreds of times before and fell asleep.  At some point between then and 10am he somehow got lodged between her and the couch and suffocated.  I'll never be able to get the image out of my head of when she woke me up screaming ""He's not breathing!"" as she held our lifeless son.

There's not one day that has gone by since that I've been able to sleep soundly.  I lay there in the dark and think about him and how much I love and miss him and just cry.  It seems every hour or two I wake up thinking I hear him crying only to remember that he's gone.

We knew a friend who had lost a baby as well who recommended that we go to a local funeral home because she knew we had no money and she told us that she had been in the same position and the funeral home worked with her and she was able to have a beautiful service and they charged her nothing.  When we told them the same, not only did we find that the bare minimum service with casket burial would cost us around $1200, they didn't even offer any sort of payment plan so that we could pay it off over time.  They seemed unwilling to help us out in any way financially, I'm not sure why they helped our friend and not us.

No one in my family has any money.  The funeral home told us if we paid a $500 deposit, they would go ahead with the service and funeral and we could talk to the Township Trustee who offered financial assistance based on income.  She told us they offered up to $750 in assistance, which was great since that was almost exactly what we needed.  My wonderful mother offered up the $500 that was supposed to be her rent money since she knew that I didn't have it and we were able to have a beautiful service and burial.

Unfortunately, when we went to talk to the Township Trustees, I was informed that due to my income (I net around $450/week), not only did we not qualify for $750, we didn't qualify for ANY assistance.

I support myself, my two-year old daughter, and my girlfriend.  After I pay rent, utilities, gas, car payment, etc. I have little to no money left every month.  My girlfriend has been trying to find a part-time job.  She actually got one at the Goodwill just before our son passed, but it's hard because we can barely even afford for her to work because child care is so expensive.

I now owe $750 to the funeral home.  What makes it even harder is that our baby boy doesn't even have his name on his grave.  Whenever I go to visit him, I feel so guilty because I'm not even able to afford a name plate to put on his grave and he deserves so much more.  The only thing we were able to decorate his grave with were flowers from the funeral and an angel statue that my girlfriend's friend gave to us at his funeral.

If anyone is able to offer any financial assistance or assistance of any other type, please help me.  Even more than money, it would make me so happy if anyone could send something to help decorate my son's grave.  He was such a sweet, beautiful boy and I want his resting place to reflect that.

This was very hard for me to write, I'm usually a very private person who doesn't show a lot of emotion or tell people how I feel about things or if I'm hurting.  More than anything it's helping for me to type out my feelings about this tragedy, I miss my son so much.

I'm sure many of you may be doubtful of whether I'm being truthful about this and I don't blame you.  I'm generally a very skeptical person as well.  I have plenty of ways to prove I'm telling the truth, but I'd prefer not to post it publicly to protect me and my family, we've been through so much already.  If there's any way I can provide proof to a moderator privately or something like that, that would be wonderful.

I know how great of a community Reddit is from my time here and I want to thank you.  Even if no one is able to help, thank you for reading my story and please keep my son in your thoughts (and/or prayers if you're religious).  Thanks again.

1334954539.0,100,self.Assistance,skaio,Help Give My Mom Some Peace of Mind; Out of Control Medical Expenses Despite having insurance,Amir0x,124,24,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/skaio/help_give_my_mom_some_peace_of_mind_out_of/,"My mom is severely ill. She's always been sick (she has everything from rheumatoid arthritis to lupus to Sjögren's syndrome), but because of the fortitude she has, she's fought it with a smile, and continued to be the loving and devoted mother and matriarch that got us all through the difficult times in our lives.

Now she is going through one final obstacle in her life, for which there is no likely going back. She has been diagnosed with some severe form of Vasculitis, which may be Wegener's Granulomatosis or another severe form, but the point is that as a result of this, her kidneys failed in September 2011.

Since then, it has been a fight with her medical insurance to try to cover the cost of the things she requires for her illness, including the dialysis. As her medical bills escalated, I've gone into my savings until I've gone broke. My father has gone into his until he has gone broke: and he's working 16 hour days, six days a week. And remember my mom has health care. This is what health care in this country looks like even when you have health care! It's not for lack of worth ethic.

We're drowning. We have nothing left to give, and the medical expenses keep on piling on.

Right now my mom is on the brutal three-times-per-week dialysis, which when combined with the other illnesses my mom already has, essentially leaves her a walking, depressed, barely-functioning zombie when she comes off. She basically is dead to the world every day, and it's killing her. Gone is her smile and that fortitude of will that has anchored this family.

She was told she was the ""perfect candidate"" for dialysis @ home, which is a much gentler type of dialysis that allows her family to train with nurses to be able to perform 2-3 hour sessions of dialysis 5 times per week, in the comfort of your own home. This would allow her to dramatically lessen her fatigue, allow her to function somewhat in the last days of her life and basically have some quality of life. It's all she wants, and I can't think of anyone who deserves it more.

So they said she could go on it, but three days into the dialysis @ home training her health insurance denied her coverage for this type. My mom has sunk ever deeper into depression, and it's killing me. I have to do something. They're still fighting to get covered, but even if in the end eventually she gets covered, the deductibles and medical expenses keep adding up, and there's no way we can cover it anymore without going into financial ruin for everyone in the family. We're already teetering on the edge.

As a result, I've decided to start a fundraiser to get a running start on these medical expenses. I have no other avenues left to me. I love this community and am starting to get the word out about the fundraiser in my own real life community starting today as well, and so the kindness of strangers and online friends and real life friends are my lifeline to try to help my mom out one last time. My mother has always been the most selfless and well meaning individual I've known, and as a son I feel desperate to try to make her happy again. 

We're having a fundraiser to try to cover her medical expenses.  Helping her live these last days with some measure of relative peace is the least I can try to do for her.

I tell him he can just have it and the other kids come closer so I tell them they can just have all the toys that are there. Who better for the toys to go to right? well they all dig around and get all the toys that they like, and after a while of being adorable and whatnot they go on down the street. 

After a while I'm resting on my porch and the youngest child, age 6, walks up with his grandmother. She had brought him down because he told her he got all the new toys at a garage sale. She was worried he might have misunderstood what a garage sale was and mistakenly taken the items without paying any money. After I assured her that the toys had indeed been free, we got to talking. 

Turns out, this lady is all four childrens' grandmother. The mother of the children had recently moved up from Charleston with her fiance and all the children. Their plan was to stay a short while while they found a home of their own in Columbia. So, the mother gets diagnosed with cancer. She undergoes a surgery to remove a tumor successfully. In her follow-up exams they see a mass on her spine. in a matter of months she has 6 tumors on her spine which renders her a paraplegic. Soon after she dies. The fiance can't handle it and jumps into a bottle, outta there. 

Well, that leaves grandma here in an 800 square-foot home with four children! She's on a fixed income, she's getting these kids back and forth to school, with no car! She's folding, and cleaning, and teaching, and talking, and brushing, and wiping, and hugging, and loving these kids, and my heart just goes out to her! I have got to get this woman some help!

I want to know from reddit, if there are charities that could help her, maybe building and addition to her house? Her only request was a safe shower, because if she got hurt the kids would have nowhere to go. Please reddit, help me find this woman some much needed and deserved assistance!

I later learned we left the first hospital, where she was visiting a friend, because they did not have a good reputation and were not equipped to perform CT scans. (She had asked the receptionist what was wrong with me.) This woman, Daniella, waited with me for 7 hours to get a brain scan. I laid my head in her lap and she rubbed my head for seven hours. She then brought me back to her village and invited me to stay with her until I felt strong enough to travel back to my camp (3 hours away) alone. I did.

We have kept in touch since. Here's the reason I'm writing you:

She is 26yrs old now, and in terrible condition. Last year she was hit by a motorcycle on her way to the market and suffered terrible injuries, most of which were to her leg. She can barely walk due to pain- all the while taking care of her niece because her sister (the mother) was killed. She requires surgery, a skin graft, physical therapy, medication... These things are not affordable or available where she lives. I have been trying to fundraise to fly her over here but as a college student working and paying my own bills, it is proving much more difficult than I'd imagined. She is part of our family. Her entire family died in a car accident 2 years before I met her. She was the only survivor. My mom, brother (fellow redditor) and grandmother are all in constant contact (we pay for her cell phone).

If she could just get here, she'd have a chance. I have two doctors and one physical therapist in my family that are willing to treat her. I have copies of care plans, receipts from her doctors in Uganda, pictures, and Emails for proof. She's receiving some care, but it's sub-par to say the least. Also, fighting off infections is nearly impossible when her only access to clean water is from a water bottle.

Please, if there is anyway you can help at all, I would be so grateful. Suggestions, thoughts, ideas. I don't know where else to turn.

With only one reply. She was so excited to see it in the mail and opened it only to find [this](http://imgur.com/xHGBHtV). I saw her heart break and she immediately started bawling uncontrollably. It hurt me so badly to see her like this and has prompted me to act. What else can I do to get her some help? We've gone all the typical routes with no results. I recently got her covered under my dental insurance through my job but we are still completely unable to pay for the cost of the full mouth reconstruction she is going to need. Any help/advice will be welcome. Below is a copy of the letter she sent. What I have not posted here that was included was a picture of her smiling. I don't think she would agree to let me post the image and I will do so, if need be, only with her consent.

&gt;My name is *Redditors Wife*. I am 25 year old stay at home mother of a beautiful 1 year old little boy. I live in and grew up in XXXXX, Texas. I am a very outgoing artistic person who loves painting and all things that are crafty. I thrive to make my family as healthy as I possibly can. But I have one thing that makes my life painful and keeps me from doing things that a normal person can do on a daily basis, that’s my teeth. 

&gt;Even as child I was constantly in pain from my teeth. My family has always been very poor and could never afford to take me to the dentist unless it was an absolute emergency. By the age 15 I had at least 10 abscessed teeth and 4 root canals. I can actually remember a time when I was 5 or 6 when I had a molar rot so bad that there was only a sliver of it sticking out of my gums. Let’s just say the tooth fairy didn’t come to see me for that tooth. My parents were young and they didn’t instill in me how important taking care of your teeth was. I never remember them telling me to brush my teeth. And I never remember drinking anything besides soda. I was constantly picked on at school for my teeth. It didn’t help that I had huge gaps because for whatever reason my laterals on top and bottom didn’t come back after I lost my baby teeth. So I was left with huge gaps. I begged and begged my parents for braces. I prayed to God every night and even asked Santa for my teeth to be fixed instead of toys for years and years. Finally my dad found a dental school that would do braces for a very low cost. I got my braces and I thought my prayers were answered but the braces turned out to actually make things worse. After 2 years they took them off and when they did, my brittle teeth just broke in chunks. I blame myself; I should have taken better care of them. My parents didn’t make it a big deal about it so I didn’t think it was. 
&gt;
After I graduated high school I was too afraid to go to college because of my teeth. I’ve put a hold my dreams because of my fear of being judged or laughed at. I really want to go to college and become a High School Biology teacher. But let’s be honest, who would hire a teacher with rotten and missing teeth? I want to teach kids. I want to be something so that my son can be proud of his mom. But with the income we have fixing my teeth is not a possibility. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been approached to do modeling and then been shot down because of my teeth. I’m afraid to look at myself in the mirror because it scares me. Young children look at me like I’m a monster, and most of the time I feel like one. I feel ugly, I feel disgusting, I feel unworthy. I don’t speak in public unless it’s absolutely necessary. People think I’m rude, but really I’m just embarrassed to be me. 
&gt;
I wake up and go to sleep in constant pain daily. I can’t eat certain foods because I’m missing those laterals. I’ve never been able to eat corn on the cob, or to bite into an apple. Meat gets caught in my gaps and it really hurts when I pull it out. My teeth cut my tongue and lips. It’s just a horrible nightmare daily because of the pain. I don’t smoke, do drugs, drink alcohol or soda. 
&gt;
Not only would getting my teeth fixed be good for my health, it will be good for my soul. I would like to feel beautiful, and feel worthy. I would like to feel what it feels like to be a normal human being. I want to be alive long enough to see my son grow. I want my husband to be proud to be married to me. He’s been my rock and I’m so thankful for him. More than anything I just want to be able to smile for the first time in my life and be comfortable in my own skin. 
&gt;
As you can see from the pictures, I need a complete smile makeover. My family is suffering financial hardships due to the fact that I cannot get a job because no one will hire me and I truly feel that it is because of my appearance. It would be life changing if there was any way that you could help assist me in being able to afford it. I could never thank you enough.

'

So my absolutely delightful grandma will be turning 93 in July, but she was diagnosed with terminal cancer in early March. I recently sent her a Mother's Day card and I got a voicemail from her, almost in tears thanking me for it because she hardly gets cards any more.
This woman is incredible - she ran away from home in Poland as a teen, and when the war started she was aboard a Red Cross train full of women and children trying to get out of the country when it was stopped by the Nazis. She lied and told them she was a nurse, so she spent the next couple years helping wounded German soldiers. One day all of her teeth were knocked out by a Nazi doctor because a soldier asked her not to change his bedpan because he was embarrassed having a pretty young woman do it, and when the doctor found out she was punished and sent to a work camp. After her camp was liberated by the American troops she met my grandpa, a young American soldier who asked a woman with no teeth, no English, and a child out of wedlock to marry him and long story short, she did just that. Her ornate wedding dress was made by hand by other kind strangers in the Displaced Persons camp she was in.


She came to the US, learned to read, write and speak English, drive, and had another daughter (my mom). So the thing is, have a really small family, and my mom recently quit her job to move there and take care of my grandma who has lived alone for almost thirty years since my grandpa died. But since my mom is out there, I'm the only family out of state, and the only family to send her cards. We're not sure she's going to make it to her birthday in July and I was thinking how nice it would be to be able to send her a giant box of cards with some nice words or an early birthday wish. If you have an extra $0.45 to spare and a few minutes to doodle a card and maybe say where you live I really think it would mean a lot to her.

(She likes birds, gardening, Wheel of Fortune, dancing to Polka music, coffee, teaching me bad words and pick-up lines in Polish, and being sassy...)

UPDATE: I've started getting some cards! After three days I have about 15 or 20 cards, and they're all awesome! I'll be sending a box of them out at the end of the week, and I'll make a new post with an update when she gets them :)

Hey Reddit!! So after a couple weeks, I have a bunch of cards from all of you! She's got cards from Taiwan, Australia, Ireland, and everywhere in between. 

I'll be sending out what I've got tomorrow in a plain box (she thinks she's just getting some Vivace coffee beans from me.) And in a couple weeks I'll send another box since I know cards got sent late or are still coming from thousands of miles away. 

It's been really surreal to see this type of kindness and I really really appreciate every hello that you sent. My goal with all of this was to put a smile on her face and make her feel connected to the world at a time when time running out can make you feel pretty alone. So thanks again for helping me make sure she knows that even in this big world, there is still thoughtfulness and human connection.


If anyone still wants to send her a card, let me know and I'll send you the address. :)

After just over a year of this we had heard that vincent, a best friend of 33 years to my father had already unknown to us previously, been participating in the tests needed in order to be a donor for my father, months passed and the final test results came in, he was a 98% match, with larger working kidneys than the average person, what are the chances right? i couldn't believe it. on April 30th 2009 Vincent gave a part of himself to save my father, almost instantly i could see returned colour in my fathers face, and an energy i had not seen in him for over a year. 



I did not know how to thank Vincent, words were not enough,actions seemed little,until now, i need to do everything i can to help this man,my hero,but i need as much help as i can possibly get. Vincent has currently been with his wonderful partner kerrie for 10 years, for 9 of them they have been engaged and they have had 2 beautiful children, throughout their lasting relationship they have battled financially to get enough money to happily wed each other however due to the time vincent had to take off of work due to the operation they have been unable to afford it since. 



Introducing JackFM,Our county radio station had announced a wedding worth £20,000-25,000 to the winner of their competition, vincent and kerrie have entered and are now through to the final round of the competition amongst 6 other couples, in order to win, they are having to advertise JackFM in any way possible, each varied way gives them a number of points, when the competition ends on the 27th june 2012, whichever couple has accumulated the most points, wins the wedding, so that's where this comes in, the couples have to upload photographs of their advertisements onto a facebook page, every like on the page, and every like per picture, increases the amount of points they get.so in order to do this, i am going to need as many of you to help as humanly possible (hope it's not too much to ask), kerrie and vincent are now in 2nd place for points, if any of you could take the time to like the below page, and as many photo's as possible, i would be eternally grateful: http://www.facebook.com/#!/KerrieVincentToWinMyBigFatJacksWedding

Before arriving in the United States, the children’s parents spent most of their lives with an estimated 150,000 refugees living in camps along the Myanmar-Thailand border. The refugees fled to escape a military dictatorship in Myanmar and now work at a meatpacking plant in the area.

Advocates for the Asian community in Iowa have set up a fund to help the families of three young drowning victims in Marshalltown bury their children. The Office of Asian and Pacific Islander Affairs, within the Iowa Department of Human Rights, is accepting donations.

UPDATE: We called enough city departments to get someone out to take pictures at least. They said they can't fix or clean anything on private property, which makes sense. (They sprayed the sidewalk I'm told)  

The core issue with this landlord/company is that they constantly hide under the excuse they just have ""so many properties."" And it's very very hard to find a phone number where you get anything but a machine. People who work for him have said his philosophy is to ""ignore problems until they go away,"" but this is crazy. I appreciate all the advice, and we've been trying to pester them, but messages are easy to ignore and I worry about being able to prove in court than I left a proper message. Tenants are split on the idea of withholding rent, and the lease imposes outrageous late fees for rent, and I'm just worried about dealing with a whole lawsuit/court thing.

How can I utilize Reddit to gain support? I am struggling mightily, and I pray Reddit can make a (big) difference in their lives.

The back story is that they were taking a taxi through Baghdad with their father and (pregnant) mother, on their way to a family event on a holiday. Our troops mistook their taxi for a car bomb, and blew it up. Their mother was killed. Omar, who was 3 or 4, was burned on ~50% of his body, losing an ear and some fingers. Dad protected Ali, 5 or 6, but in doing so caught 23 pieces of shrapnel throughout his body. There are physical and psychological challenges for everyone involved. 

My health has deteriorated, and I really need as much help as I can muster to give these kids a fighting chance at a decent life.

We live in Boston, but it is my hope that Reddit can offer help locally *and* long distance.

My first two thoughts, which I hope we can build on together as a community, are arranging for volunteers to read to them and requesting iPad reading apps to be gifted to them. We have two iPads: I have one and they have one. In my experience they learn better reading on the iPad. Their lack of reading skills is my paramount concern. They're years behind their classmates.

I volunteer for the Volunteer Humane Society of Lancaster, Massachusetts. We are a no-kill, nonprofit organization that only takes in kitties from all over the state. We constantly take in cats that would have otherwise been euthanized in kill shelters in the area that are over capacity.
I'd like to think we provide a comfortable home for these guys, but an even more comfortable home would be yours! As many of you may know, the time between April and September is referred to as ""kitten season"" at shelters, as they're born and dumped and dropped off here the most in those months. In addition to that, adoptions have been extremely slow, so we are currently at capacity with our karma machines!

To add to this, many of our kittens come to us with upper respiratory infections and need special attention. This not only takes time away from the healthy adults, it also puts them at risk of infection as well. So, the sooner we get them out of here, the better!
So this is my plea for anyone in the area looking to adopt: This Saturday, I will be holding adoption hours between 1 and 3 p.m. at our location in Lancaster. We are reducing our rates to $50 per adult cat and $100 per kitten in hopes that we can get these guys to great homes this weekend.

Here is a link to a photo album of all available cats right now (not all kittens are pictured): http://imgur.com/a/j5BiE

Please spread the word, or PM me if you're interested in any cat in particular that's listed!

I told him, and he asked for my email address. Next thing I know, he tells me to check my email, and I open it and I was just in shock. He said ' To get you out of the red, to get some stamps, and have a few bucks for food or whatever. Hope you get back on top of things soon.'

I didn't want to come to you all like this, but I'm literally left without options right now. I've been without a home for about 10 days now, and things are getting worse instead of better. Last week, I checked into shelters in the area, and applied for assistance. Every shelter that I checked was full, and worse, most had a waiting list.

How did I get here? The story is rather long and embarrassing but I'm willing to give the short version. I'm willing to do anything, actually. This situation started a few months back, when I lost my wallet. I'm not sure where or how the wallet was lost, but the end result was a week of expenses, that I couldn't cover, and some short falls that led to worse situations. I had to cancel all of my cards, and my ID was missing along with the rest of the wallet contents. I had already been living on borrowed credit, as it was, and this just led to things getting even worse.

In the midst of all this my wife's father became very ill, and she needed get a trip back home to Massachusetts.

Her and I had wanted to move back to New England for sometime now, just be closer to family and whatnot. I started looking for jobs in the Boston area, with the idea that I would move our belongings up north and find a place close to her mother, so we can take care of her. I found a position in Manchester, New Hampshire, not exactly ideal, but a step in the right direction for sure. the job starts on November 5th, and I have to make it until I get my first paycheck some 2 weeks later. the contract I was working at the time, was coming to an end, and it wasn't going to be renewed because the position was closing due to the job being finished. When I received that news, I knew I was up a creek without a paddle. I weighed my options, and decided that I would go up north to be with my wife and son, and start this new position on the 5th of next month.

So with my last paycheck in hand, I rented a storage space for all of my belongings, a truck to get it all there, and had a few hundred dollars left over for fuel for the trip up the east coast. Between driving and resting it took me about 24 hours to make a trip from North Carolina to northeastern Massachusetts. My wife had told me before I left, that it was going to be a tight fit in her mother's house with all of us staying there. As it was, my wife and son were only supposed to be there visiting while she tried to get her mother some help. About 6 hours before my trip ended, my wife called to tell me that her mother felt there wasn't enough room for me to stay with all of them. It's a 2 bedroom house, and staying in the same bedroom as my wife and son, shouldn't have been a problem. That said, her mother has put her foot down, and I suddenly found myself without a place to stay. I begged and pleaded with her mother - even offered my last $100, all to no avail.

That first night here in Mass, I called a few friends that I had left in this area, and tried to find a couch to sleep on. One after the other told me that their wives wouldn't have it, or they didn't have the room. I suppose that if I was in my early twenties, that I might have a little bit better luck, and I might also have a larger circle of friends. I know that when I was at that age, plenty of friends spent many moons on my couches. There isn't however, a lot of sympathy for guys my age, that just shouldn't be in this position. 

So, here I am. I found a few soup kitchens in the area, that did provide me with breakfast. One of the friends I have, that can't let me stay with him, has provided me with a few dinners, and has let me shower at his place. 

I need a couch to sleep on, and I really need to find some money for fuel and food. I am a software developer, and willing to work for anything that I can possibly get. I don't however, have a laptop that I can use to do any work on, at the moment. My desktop PC is of no use, because I have nowhere to set it up, nor plug it in, for that matter. I thought of taking that computer to a pawn shop, but I don't that PC myself, and no one sees any value in it. If anyone needed any website work done, or software built, I would love to do it. I would just need a place to do it at, and a PC to do it with. I can build web sites, and business software, to anyones delight, and it should probably go without saying, that I would work for pennies on the dollar right now.

If anyone has a place that I can stay, I'm a very clean individual, and I'm drug and disease free. I drink only socially, and for that matter, I haven't had a drink in almost two years. It's just not my thing.

Aside from that, I could use any help in the way of fuel or food assistance. My wife and I went to the welfare office, and applied for food stamps and cash assistance. My family as a whole, made too much last year, and we were denied for cash assistance, nor housing assistance. She and the baby, however, did qualify for food stamps, and to my surprise medical care assistance, as well. That is an absolute blessing to know that they are going to be okay, well I get myself back on my feet. It's getting through the next 3 weeks a cell that is going to be the problem for me, and I cant go in to a new job with the problems that I am currently facing. I haven't been able to wash the clothes that I have with me, and that's going to be a big problem too. 

Reddit, I just don't know what to do right now. I do not have a PayPal account, nor do I know how anyone can actually help me. The only place that I know of where I can receive an email is at my wife's mother's house. I've been reading other peoples posts, and I've seen that some people have gone as far as making an Amazon or Walmart wish list, so that others can pick out items for them to buy. I'm not looking for someone to fill a grocery cart for me, I just need to make it through the next few weeks. The plan is to get the first paycheck, and check myself into a hotel or motel, where I can at least have a room, and a bed. If I can somehow make it that far, I know I will be okay. I'm not asking that someone put me up in a hotel, I'm just asking for a couch, some food, and some way to get fuel.

I can provide whatever proof that I can, though I'm not sure how I will scan anything in right now. I literally have $3 in my pocket, and now I'm finally at the point where I'm asking for help. I never dreamed that I would be asking for help like this. I am embarrassed and ashamed. not only can I not take care of myself, but I am a useless father and husband right now, and that's the part that really hurts.

As I said, I'm willing to do some work, for anyone that can help me out. If you yourself don't need to work, but know someone who does, I would love to talk to that person. 

I'm typically way too proud to ask for help, especially from strangers over the internet, but I am at the end of this rope, and I'll be spending the night again in the car.

I am Dennis, a morbidly obese 24 year old (25 in a few days)
I have finally, after 15+ years of obesity realized that i need to change my lifestyle.

This is me today:

[Front](http://i.imgur.com/fFTql)

[Side](http://i.imgur.com/dgzuI)

[Glamour shot](http://i.imgur.com/SRWna)

Before this realization i lived a very inactive life, i never went outside, didn't do any exercise, if i had to go anywhere important i got driven by my friends or my mom, i ate a big bag of potato chips each day, i ate mostly white bread, pizzas, burgers and much more.

But this is now over, about 3-4 weeks ago i decided it was enough, i went cold turkey, no more chips, no more white bread - and I've had 1 pizza and 1 burger since then (on 2 special occasions) i eat fruit every day, i switched to rye bread, i make smoothies instead of buying a bag of potato chips.

I have also started walking, almost every day.

The fact that i can track my progress on Endomondo via my phone has really encouraged me to continue.

http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/user/1009853
And i can both see and feel a big difference already - i walk faster and i don't get tired as quickly.


All in all i am feeling great.


**TL:DR:**

But i need help.

I'm broke since i'm on welfare, and buying fruit is actually insanely expensive compared to buying a bag of chips.
And i could really use a few things to help my weigh loss

One thing is new clothes. I'm currently walking around sweating like a beast in my normal everyday clothes because i cant afford new clothes
*1 Big clothes are generally expensive.
*2 The only place i can get clothes my size in Denmark is halfway across the country in an overpriced store
So my only choice is to order clothes from other countries and cross my fingers it wont get caught by customs

Another thing is new shoes, i haven't bought new shoes in 2 years, and I'm currently down to my old worn out Croc's knockoffs with holes in them, and i get blisters where the holes are, plus its really uncomfortable in the rain.

The third thing is more of a luxury item, a [Hydration Pack](http://www.hydrapak.com/store-2/#ecwid:category=632541&amp;mode=product&amp;product=2479637) - a backpack with a water pouch in it - which just enables me to walk further since i don't have to lug around a giant bottle of water

**Edit 1**
WoW, im overwhelmed by the positive feedback &lt;3 thank you all for your kind words

i was asked to make a wishlist with sizes and such so here goes:

&gt; T-shirts - 5-6 XL by ""Espionage"" brand standards - which is 58-60"" - 62-64"" according to their sizing chart (147/152 - 157/162 in centimeters)

&gt; Pants - 58"" waist (145 centimeters) by KAM jeans standard

&gt; Shoes - 46-47 EU (US = 12-13 UK = 11½-12½)

&gt; Hydration Pack http://www.hydrapak.com/store-2/#ecwid:category=632541&amp;mode=product&amp;product=2479637

**Edit 2**
And someone asked for my paypal - the email is dummiesworld@hotmail.com

**Edit 3**

I've learned that when ordering from the UK to denmark you avoid import taxes+fee's unlike when ordering from fx. USA

So i went ahead and made a wishlist on the UK amazon

http://www.amazon.co.uk/registry/wishlist/KEHYTU03PODG

**Edit 4**

I have decided a few days ago to start on the so called ""Slow Carb"" diet - from Tim Ferriss's book ""The Four Hour Body"" - i will begin the diet when my next welfare check arrives, but this is the reason for the PAGG supplements on my wishlist, as it is a requirement on that diet, and the fat measurer (since he says it is important to keep measurements)

My little boy got sick and I had to take him to the vet. While I was able to pay for the first bit of care I'm afraid this second half is not so easy. I just graduated and moved, we haven't been here a week... but my savings all went into moving. 
Suddenly yesterday morning thor got sick. He was vomiting blood and i took him to the vet.  After some primary assessment we returned home with medicines and cuddles to see if he felt any better. by the fourth time he had vomited I had to take him back. He is still there right now.~~

~~I want help with paying for the treatment and medicines he's gotten. When I first posted about him I did not expect the response I got. I was sad because I would not be able to help my kitty.~~
~~Youre probably asking yourself why He is so important to me. Here where i moved I know no one, I havent even started my job yet, he's my best friend here. There is more to it than that. I posted this on the /r/cats thread:
I have a panic disorder. Usually when i get nervous he is very receptive, he's cuddly and wont leave my side until I'm. Before I'd decided to keep him i was just taking care of him while we found him a home (he's a stray). I had noticed how receptive he was to my moods and found that really comforting but one day i had a really bad panic attack. At this point i can control them pretty well, but this day was especially bad, I ahd to call my friend and the counselors because i was not okay...
Now thor... He goes downstairs while i'm talking to my counselor on the phone, I figured my attack had scared him away, but no. He came back with kibble in his mouth and set ti down in front of me, he tired to get me to eat it. When i didnt pick it up he picked it up again and got ontop of me and dropped it on my face.
He is really special to me, He was able to help me then and he helps me so much even now..~~

~~I made a small wordpress for him, pass it along if you can... 
http://thorsmedicalfund.wordpress.com/~~



~~He has helped many so many times. Now i need some help so that I can help him. In total I will need about 700$ To help him. I am posting the [receipt](http://imgur.com/a/OjZnd) and estimate for the vet services that my vet gave me. the vet has been nice enough to give me some of the food he will need for free, and one of the medicine for free too, these are the other expenses so far.~~ 

~~You dont have to give much, or if you cant give then keep s in your thoughts. I will update this regularly to keep you informed.  If you do give I can pay you back later, as i mentioned I am starting a job now, I know i can return the money after I have worked for a while. In any case, thank you for all your help.~~

I need to see him again before he passes away. I live in California, and he lives in Missouri. I do not have paid time off, and I am $150 short of making it work so I can visit home again. I grew up never having known my father, but my grandpa was my male role model, he was the man that taught me how to be a man.
I remember when I was about seven years old he had a garden in the back yard. Pretty standard: potatoes, beans, carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes. Anyway, we go out one morning to pick tomatoes, only to find something had taken bites and nibbles out of half the tomatoes. My grandpa gets the idea to pick them separately, and then tells me to go get my wiffle ball bat. For the rest of the day we play baseball with tomatoes, and for a seven year old boy that’s about the best day you can have.
I’m honestly scared for him to go, he was and is who I look up to as a man. I ask myself if I can live up to his expectations. I have never tried to be a man without him around to call for advice.
He’s a great guy, you’d like him. He’s a German immigrant, who has survived more hardship than I can imagine, and still he’s quick with a joke. He’s a cabinet maker, he can fix damn near anything.
He has Parkinson's, and it's getting worse by the day. I’m gonna miss him. A lot. I need to see him again, so I can get him on video, so I can always listen to him tell a story. So I don’t forget the sound of his voice or his accent

A fellow redditor told me about this subreddit from /r/offmychest .  I sort of just wanted to release emotions and clear my mind on a post I made ""As a father of 4, I have failed"".  If I can give you a little back story, I met my girlfriend who had 2 kids from a previous marriage whose husband cheated on her and left.  When we got together, even though we used birth control we were surprised with twin boys.

We were getting by ok when this year just pounded away at us.  Had to buy a new minivan (it was used, around 2,000 dollars), during the summer due to our other van losing the transmission.  Then a couple months later my brother who was a father as well was murdered in a Rite-Aid, and I gave whatever I could to help them out with bills.

Month after that I broke my leg, and missed a months worth of work and income.  I work two jobs, and my girlfriend works full time as well.  But digging out of this hole from falling behind is killing us right now.  My power is due to be cut off on Monday, and water is due to be cut off as well, the landlord is calling every other day asking when we will be paying rent on time, usually it's paid in full by the 15th.  

The main thing I need help with is helping my kids get some Christmas gifts on Christmas morning.  If we don't have power that's fine, no water we will deal, but I just can't bare to look in their eyes on Christmas to see nothing.  I have tried a couple churches in my area, and other places but their funds are exhausted.  Any other ideas that I could try? Thanks for taking the time to read this.

Josh was bright and cheerful throughout his struggles...he always had a smile on his face, and maintained a positive attitude even when he was in terrible pain. He loved rap music and he loved football. He wanted so badly to live a full life and do so many things.

I'm taking a huge risk posting this on my main account. I'm not just asking for handouts. I'm asking for any tips, advice, assistance. Anything to help me get out of this. 

The father of my two year old twins is abusive. The abuse has been sporadic throughout our three year relationship. It started with being pushed while I was pregnant, and has progressed into him throwing objects at me, restraining me, driving recklessly while the boys are in the car. Anything to control me. 

He used to be so cruel to our dog. He would pick him up by a limb and throw him into his kennel, and then throw the kennel upside down. My boys are getting to be the age where they're into everything. His fuse is obviously getting shorter. A few days ago my son climbed onto the tv table. He grabbed him by the arm and pulled him off, but didn't set him on the floor. He let him drop the last couple of inches. My son started crying and wanted to be held because he hurt his bottom. His father said  ""No, you're in trouble"" I'm afraid what's going to happen next time. 

I've contacted the local shelter, but not only are they full, they said I'm inappropriate for shelter. I'm not abused enough according to them. I'm on the waiting list for transitional housing for homeless families. I qualify since if I leave, I will be homeless. There are ten families ahead of me, and each family can stay up to two years, so I have no idea how long I will have to wait. 

I want to leave. I want to leave *tonight* but I have absolutely nowhere to go. I have no friends or family to stay with. I don't have a job, I have nothing saved. He works and manages the money. Everything goes through him. Everything in our house is his. I have nothing but what I can fit into a duffle bag.

Robbers had gotten in and apparently had enough time to take all of our electronics, including all of the components I had saved up for to purchase to build my first PC.

Here's the weirdest part..they took all of our food. Everything. If it was refrigerated or frozen, they threw it down on the ground and it went bad, but anything dry (even cooking supplies like flour and sugar) they took. It's the strangest robbery I've ever seen. The only thing they didn't take was the alcohol, so at least I can drown away my sorrows!  Probably the most important thing that they stole was all of my medication.  I suffer from a couple different medical ailments and I can't afford to repurchase them for the month.  They aren't exactly inexpensive.

As an idiot, I didn't think I would need renter's insurance. And, because I just dished out the last of my budget on computer parts, I don't have enough money to go get enough food to last me until next month.

I hate asking for help. I hate it. But this time I genuinely need it, so here I am reaching out. I don't ask for much, just enough to get me through until next month. They even took all of my Ramen. My go-to food. And I had almost 30 pounds of frozen meats in the freezer that are now ruined.

Thank everyone in advance for their help. Again, I'm not picky. Anything you can offer is appreciated more than you can imagine.

Here are some pictures, just sort of as proof.

[Dining Room](http://i.imgur.com/dylNK.jpg) This was more trashed but I started cleaning it up before I even thought to take a picture.

I didn't take pictures of the living room or anything, just because they are literally empty.  Not much to see.  But I'm happy to if more proof is needed.  I did fill out a police report, but they said there isn't much they can do other than trying to catch the guy.  Basically I'm not going to be getting any of my stuff back.

Tashi, his wife, took up part time jobs to support him through college since he was closer to graduating. But when he was diagnosed it became practically impossible for her to work anymore. Wash needs constant attention, to keep him from getting hurt, to remember to turn the oven off, to remember his medicines, ect. 

This is why I am here. They need help. They really need financial help. Here is their monthly budget rundown:

**Income**
Social Security income / month $740.00
Food Stamps SNAP $280.00- food only no cash/TAFNF benefits /month

**Expenses**

*MediCare + AHCCCS (Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System)     insurance premium $115.25 /month

*Rent $750.00

*APS (electricity) Summer $250-300/month Winter $50-100.00

*Wash's meds (non insured) $800-1000.00 / month

*Co-pay's average month $25-40.00

*Tashi's meds $20 /month with insurance 

*Car insurance $65.00/ month

*Gas $60-100.00 /month

*Phone $55.00 /month

*Cable-Internet $120.00 / month 

*Netflix $25.00 / month (approx)

*Pet needs (food, litter) $20.00 / month average

*Sundries (shampoo, deodorant, lotion, sunblock, clothes) $50.00 or so

*Doesn't account for any illnesses or sudden car issues etc. 

Obviously they run into money shortages on a daily basis. They both came from middle class families that are unable to give much financial assistance. I understand being reluctant or unable to give financially, but perhaps you can help in other ways. Do you live around Phoenix? They can always use help picking up prescriptions (a daily chore), taking Wash to doctor's appointments, or just having someone to stay with Wash so Tashi can have a few hours to herself. She has spent the last almost 2 years working 24/7 for no pay. She has kept her husband alive so much longer than the doctors had predicted, and she has done it while watching her husband slip away. Her best friend, the man she wanted to have children with, to grow old with. She will take care of him until her life force is drained. But Tashi needs people to give her support too. 

So now we come to the verifying part of this post. [Here is the link to their local new story](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2010-08-05/news/til-death-do-us-part-they-got-married-then-everything-changed/).  Their story was vetted by the newspaper for several months before printing, so this should be an extremely credible source. It is a long and emotionally draining read, but please take the time to read the article. It describes their struggle with just maintaining the state run insurance, learning they would most likely be unable to ever have children, how all the little disturbances we all deal with like car repairs and simple illnesses turn into major problems for them. Please read it.

**For some reason I can't link directly to the paypal site in this post, but if you go to their blog at the above link, in the top right hand corner you will see the link to their paypal site**

Wash will not see a cure. He has already outlived what the doctors had predicted for him. Everyday he wakes up is a miracle. Tashi and Wash deserve to have days that aren't full of worrying about how to pay for his medications. They have a lot of medical expenses coming due this Friday, they are in desperate need. 

I know this economy is really sucky for most of us, but understand how all the little help we can give will grow into a big help for them.

If you have any questions please feel free to send me a message, I have my verification code ready and waiting.  

FRAK CANCER!

**INFO REGARDING THEIR PAYPAL ACCOUNT BEING IN ANOTHER PERSON'S NAME. PLEASE READ**

**Shannon Rich started the paypal for them since AHCCCS only allows a certain number of ""bank accounts"" of which they count paypal as one. That's what they were told in 2010 after they cancelled his insurance once before. Since it's in Shannon's name and run by the fraternity, the insurance company don't take up Tashi's precious time. Also this means there is a legal record of any donations for Tashi and Wash, that way it's not just them asking for money with no accountability.**

**There are also the more personal reasons they do it this way. Tashi lets Shannon know their bills and she gives them enough money to cover them. If there is anything 'extra' she keeps it in paypal for when either of them has an emergency, like going to the er and doctors several times this summer, all the co-pays and ect.
Wash cannot be trusted with money. It's just part of having brain cancer. So Tashi keeps their accounts away from him and she tries not to put cash where he can find and spend/lose it.**",,False,,t5_2s25d,True,,,True,t3_kl6z4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/kl6z4/help_say_frack_you_to_brain_cancer_with_my/,

My story is simple, but it isn't very sweet. I found out I was pregnant with my daughter in March of 2012. Her due date was December 7th. My fiance and I couldn't have been happier. Unfortunately, on October 17th, I went in for a routine check up and found out my daughter had passed away. (I was 33 weeks into my 40 week pregnancy). They rushed me to the hospital to induce me, only to find out later that she passed away due to a fatal nechal cord. (Umbilical cord was wrapped around her throat). On top of being out of work for three weeks, and dealing with bereavement and grievance, we just found out we don't have enough money to pay for our rent, and don't have much longer to find it. I already lost my daughter, and had to pay for her funeral.. Why is life making me lose my home too? I honestly don't know what to do. I'm not looking for a hand out, but just advice. I am back at work, getting all the hours that I can and trying my hardest to find extra work but I just can't keep up with these bills. Any ideas? 

TL;DR Daughter died, can't pay bills due to funeral and bereavement. Idea's welcome on how to make quick cash without being a scoundrel.

What you just looked at are the bandages from the surgery to remove the abscess next to my spine, the hospital orders and the semi-permanent IV inserted from my arm into the large vein in my chest called a PICC( peripherally inserted central catheter) line. I'm fine with most stuff, rent is paid, local food pantry has me enough food until i can get my food stamps going(2 weeks), but I spent nearly every dime on medicine and things like rent, electric deposits etc. My  gasoline is now on E and there is no bus nearby to ride. I need some gas money or even just the gas.

Problem with that is I have overdrawn my PayPal and my bank account so the only way I can think to even receive money for fuel quickly is a moneygram or western union or somesuch, hell if you got a full 5 gallon gas can bring it by, if you know of a better solution please let me know. If one or two of you kind souls could manage a few bucks for gas it would be a literal life saver(well maybe not a life saver, but would certainly improve my health)

I've gotten help here before, my year has been full of hospitals and financial difficulties. In January 2013 when I return to school under the veterans VRAP program things should ease up a bit, I may even be able to help someone else out (I dearly hope so) to pay forward all the help i have been given. If you're local I'll come fix your computer for free!

EDIT: Last use of the PICC until surgery. Only wound dressing for next week or 10 days.

Update: I received $20.00 for a redditor who wishes to to remain anonymous. That 1/4 tank will take me through the first half of the weak easily. I have to make it 2 weeks from today so I'm thinking that about $80.00 in gasoline would do the trick. So a few $20 egift cards from Thornton's would be marvy and I can chill here without worrying how the hell to get my dressings changed, not to mention making it to doctor's and surgeon appts so this thing with my back and spine will be taken care of once and for all.

***

Hi, I started [/r/troubledteens](/r/troubledteens). A sixteen-year-old girl desperately needs our help. The short version is that she is about to be sent away to a 'troubled teen' facility with many allegations of abuse at her estranged, wealthy father's insistence. He has said she will stay there until she turns 18. She has committed no crime, and has not been accused of one. Even though her mother has custody, the teen is being threatened by a judge to allow Diamond Ranch Academy's ""Escort Service"" to kidnap her daughter on June 1st at 4:30am. Her full story is below, and ways you can help are at the end of this post.

***

From the Save Victoria from Diamond Ranch Academy ([facebook group description](http://www.facebook.com/groups/304983609585145/members/)):

Victoria is a 16-year-old girl from the St. Tammany Parish of New Orleans who is scheduled to be taken against her will to Diamond Ranch Academy on Friday, June 1.

Diamond Ranch Academy – DRA – is a residential treatment center that markets itself as a “residential treatment center with a boarding school approach.” DRA is nothing like a normal boarding school. In reality, DRA’s program is based on holding children against their will, without any open communication to the outside world. Children at DRA do not have free access to a telephone, cell phone, email or the Internet. There are a growing number of allegations about the use of illegal restraint practiced by the staff at DRA. Boarding schools do not deny their students access to a telephone; nor do they physically restrain students for speaking out of turn, falling out of line, refusing to perform calisthenics, refusing to count out loud while using the bathroom, or telling their parents that they want to come home. Students have reported DRA using physical restraint in a large number of instances like these.

Victoria did not like or do well in public school. This past January, she transferred to a local magnet school that runs from 4 pm to 9 pm; she enjoys and is doing well here. This school has a large minority population. The father does not want Victoria to attend this magnet school. He is a wealthy cardiologist who seems determined to control his daughter’s education and life. He went to court and was able convince a judge to order that Victoria go to DRA. He has told the daughter she will be sent away until she is 18.

Victoria’s mother and father were never married, and Victoria has always lived with her mother. Her mom is an emergency room trauma nurse who has worked at the same hospital for 18 years. Victoria’s mother and father share custody, but the mom is the ‘domiciliary parent.’ Victoria and her dad do not get along and he has never been a significant part of her life.

Victoria has not abused drugs, she doesn’t smoke, doesn’t drink. She is not under any type of criminal investigation, and she is not on any type of probation.

It is our opinion that DRA was misrepresented to the judge, who believed it to be more like a traditional boarding school when she ordered Victoria to attend. We do not believe the judge was aware of the investigations conducted of DRA and the allegations of illegal physical restraint. It seems that this is a case where the father’s attorneys were more successful than the mother’s attorney, and now a child is going to be put in harm’s way if she ends up being taken to DRA.

Victoria does not want to go to DRA. Her mother has conducted significant research about DRA and is horrified by the allegations of physical, psychological and emotional abuse. The mother is appealing the judge’s decision, and needs our help. The mother is desperately trying to save her daughter from being taken to DRA.

***

**WAYS YOU CAN HELP**

- We need to find a lawyer who has the ability to file an emergency injunction (in the state of Louisiana) on behalf of a minor who is about to be court ordered to Diamond Ranch Academy against her will, without a conviction (or any evidence of any wrong doing) and against the consent of her primary guardian, her mother. Her mother's finances are an issue, if someone could do this pro-bono or nominal rate, that would be very helpful.

- We need to get Victoria's story out to the press, this is our best weapon. ~~Another advocate is working on a press release, I will post it when ready.~~ Press release [here](http://troubledprograms.com/savevictoria-press-release-may-26th-2012/). If you have any media contacts, especially in New Orleans, please let them know what's happening. You can give them my email address, reddittroubledteens@gmail.com, and I can put them in touch with Victoria's mother.

- IDEAS! Reddit, you are so smart. Have a thought to help save Victoria? Please post it.

- Please spread Victoria's story. x-post to reddit, share on facebook, join &amp; share the [facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/groups/304983609585145/), tweet (#SaveVictoria), blog, etc. Social networking can mean all the difference in the world to a girl like Victoria. The judge is up for reelection, and I've heard the father wants to keep this quiet. Make some noise! 

- *Edit: Also, you can share this [petition](http://troubledprograms.com/save-victoria-from-diamond-ranch-academy/) that has some of the basic information on what's happening.

Thank you.

Friday, I received a text from my mother saying the neighbors dog had broken into our yard and chased our cat, Doug.  She recovered Doug, but his arm was floppy and he couldn't put pressure on it, but he didn't seem to be in too much pain.  I mean, we were able to pick him up and hold him and stuff, so we waited a day before taking him to the vet.  We were under the impression that the dog had just...attacked him and dislocated his shoulder or something.  We took him to the vet and they told us that his arm bone was shattered, and that they could either amputate ($700) or preform a surgery where they would attempt to piece back together his arm($3000).  Again - we were under the impression the neighbors dog had done this damage.  They took x-rays of his arm, and they found bullet fragments.  Someone shot our fucking cat.  By no means is our cat vicious or dangerous, he's sweet.  He's sweet to everyone and everything.  We didn't even hear gunshots.  But this cat took it like a fucking champ.  Even with bullet fragments in his arm, he still allowed us to hold him and cuddle him.  Now, our vet gave us those two choices, and we want the amputation to be the very last thing we consider, because it'll limit his mobility, make him an inside cat, and give him a higher chance of arthritis.  We've had a cat with arthritis before, and we want to do everything to avoid giving Doug a life like that.  I can't prove anything with the x-rays as of yet, but I will post it when I receive it.  I can post the emergency vet bill. 

We're a low income family, and we're trying to manage his bills.  Our friends on facebook has helped up raise over 700 dollars, and we're extremely thankful.  Anything at all will help.  Even if its 10 cents, it'll really help us out.  I put a goal of 1800 on chipin.  Please, if you could, spread the word around.  Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.

Short Story:
I left my iPad in a bag with some papers for work at a restaurant. When I called the next day they didn't have it. I considered as gone and probably stolen by maintenance.

Fast forward a month to 9/8. I look at my Photostream on my iphone to see pictures that I didn't take and realize they must be from the people who stole it. I go on iPhoto to see that the pictures have location info also. At this point in time I posted my story to Reddit thinking it was a pretty dumb mistake on the criminals part and maybe some people know what I can do.

I contacted the police and gave them all of my details about the story and the address where the photos of the guys were taken. They went over there on Sunday night (9/9) and apparently recovered the device along with my bag and all my work papers (no idea why someone would keep that stuff). They also have the criminals in custody last I knew, they didn't tell me anymore about that aspect of it.

So in short, thank you everyone for your suggestions. This has been a pretty crazy few days and I'm so glad to know my iPad was recovered.

Long Version:

I went to a restaurant in NYC (Trattoria Dell'Arte - 900 7th Ave at 57th) on what I think was August 6th. When I left the restaurant I forgot my laptop bag next to my chair against the wall. In the bag was a iPad 2 16GB 3G in Black and some papers from work. When I realized I had forgotten it the next day I immediately called the restaurant who claimed they knew nothing about it, but would call me if something came up. Later in the day I went back to the restaurant in person to see if anything had been found yet. They claimed to know nothing.

Today I went to check my photostream on my iphone and there was a bunch of photos of the guy who stole it and his friends with location data. So I have the location of what I assume is their house, what can I do with this?

They hadn't connected the iPad to the internet until today because I had sent a lock request from find my iphone which confirmed lock today. Also I had it display a message to call me if it was found.

All I want is my iPad back. I considered it as a loss already, but know I what this guy looks like and where he lives. He could work at the restaurant and be the one who took it or have purchased it from someone, but the pictures were taken starting August 28th and more were taken today.

Please help me get my things back (the iPad is most important, but I'd love to get the bag and all my papers which I'm sure are already thrown out). I can also call the local police and see what they can do.

UPDATE:
Local Police have been contacted and given his information. They are looking into it today and will update me as they learn anything.

UPDATE #2:
I have been speaking with the police who last night went to the address I gave them from the location data on the photostream photos. The people living at that address had already been convicted of some other crimes so they were able to match the pictures I gave them and find the guys who took my iPad. They got it back at around 4am last night and will be shipping it to me at the end of the week.

Help my friend with lung cancer try and fulfill one of her bucket list wishes: See a taping of Ellen.,mcakez,79,16,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/xb7yb/please_help_my_friend_with_lung_cancer_try_and/,"Okay, reddit, so I'm not quite sure how to do this, but I am open to suggestions, and figure someone out there must know someone. 

Meet [Jen.](http://imgur.com/a/JRieN#0)


She is 36 years old, a wonderful wife and mother, an amazing friend and inspiration, and she is struggling to beat cancer for the second time in three years. 

About six months ago, just before the New Year, Jen went in for her six-month check up and discovered that far from being cancer free, she was now set to battle lung cancer. 

A few days later she commented that she had long had 'see a taping of Ellen' on her bucket list, because it was something her mother had also had on her list before she passed in 2008.

Along with three of my friends, we sat down to craft a letter to send to the Ellen show, which I've included below. Unfortunately, we never heard back.

A few days ago, Jen went in for a CT scan, and found out that despite several months of chemo and radiation, she has not gone into remission. They are giving her body three months to rest before they tackle treatment again. 

She is, in a word, terrified. She is also still strong.

My friend Erin (featured in one of the album pictures) texted me last night to ask me if I knew how to use 'reddit,' as Jen's husband had recommended it as something that had helped people in the past. 

So that's the short version of why I am here. Now I just need to know what to do next.

I'm posting this now, because hopefully I can get some suggestions on how to go forward, and also because I've broken down crying twice while writing this (shit just got real, basically). 

Thank you for reading, and please help me figure out what to do next!

ETA: Someone said this doesn't make it clear what we 'want' out of this campaign. Well, for one thing, as stated, we would like suggestions for how to make this happen. We would like visibility to try and get it into the right hands. Writing a letter didn't work, so we have to find a way to get the letter seen. 




**Letter to Ellen, dated Feb 6th, 2012:**
&gt;*What can’t you say about Jen? She’s a rockstar. She’s spunky, sassy, sarcastic, silly, beautiful, amazing, compassionate, a chef, a mother, a wife, a sister, an aunt and above all our best friend. We have an unspoken rule - whenever we are down, hurting, or feel like we want to die, we go to Jen’s. There we  have a shoulder to cry on, a belly full of food, a standing dance-party date and hours of laughter. Our favorite moments are when all our girls are together in the backyard for entire evenings at a time, laughing , telling jokes, filling in Star Wars mad-libs, playing rock band and just creating our unbreakable bond. Our unit is tight. When anyone is down and out, we rally. That’s why when  Lori suggested we write to you on Jen’s behalf, we were immediately enthusiastic. We all love your show (I mean obviously, you’re awesome. Duh.), but Jen especially because it was something she shared with her beloved mother. We have all talked of road-tripping to a taping but have never found a time where we could all go. Well, the time has come. As Jen says, “This has been on my bucket list since the last time I had cancer!!”*

&gt;*2008 was a big year for Jen. It started off with a BANG, which resulted in a long sought after pregnancy.  Having inherited an infinitely nurturing and maternal spirit from her own mother, motherhood was what Jen had been waiting for her whole life. She and her husband had been trying for years to conceive, so this tiny miracle meant everything to them.*

&gt;*Only a month after this happy discovery, Jen’s mother, Margie, finally succumbed to the diabetes with which she had been struggling for many years. Margie passed on April Fool’s Day (no joke), but not before correctly divining her unborn grandchild’s gender and naming him Liam. Margie’s death was mourned by many people - she had been a devoted and intensely loving mother and wife, but her mourners extended well beyond blood ties. Margie was, like her daughter, a powerful force of positivity and good will in her world. Many a birthday, Halloween, thanksgiving, New Years, or random, just-because afternoon was spent assembled at Margie’s house. He door was always open to anyone who wanted to stop by and feel a part of a warm, accepting community of people.*

&gt;*Days after Margie’s funeral, Jen started hemorrhaging. Terrified that she had lost her tiny miracle, she rushed to the emergency room. The ensuing weeks of diagnostic tests revealed that she had a rare form of cervical cancer, undetectable by standard examination. Had it not been for Liam, Jen’s cancer would have gone undetected for who knows how long and we may have lost her forever.*

&gt;*The following months were tenuous, Jen determined to carry her child to term, the doctors unable to treat her cancer for fear of hurting the baby. She was weak and bleeding, but love for her child took precedence over her own well-being, so treatment had to wait until his birth. In early September, when Liam had been cooking for thirty-two weeks (the earliest gestational age at which docs will voluntarily take a child from the womb), a cesarean section was performed and Liam spent weeks in the NICU while his mother began radiation and chemotherapy. In December, Jen underwent a radical hysterectomy and was declared cancer-free the following June.* 

&gt;*For years, we have been thoroughly enjoying our lives, knowing Jen will be with us for an indefinite length of time. However, this past October, Jen came down with what she believed to be bronchitis. An asthmatic since childhood, her difficulty breathing did not cause her much alarm. She sought medical treatment, which proved fruitless for many weeks, until she was diagnosed with Laryngoesophogeal Reflux, which was blamed for her respiratory difficulties.*

&gt;*Just before New Year’s, Jen published a Facebook post informing her friends and family that she was going in for her six-month cancer check-up and looked forward to being cancer free for 2012.*

&gt;*That’s not how it went down.*

&gt;*Jen’s tests came back abnormal and, taking a cue from her recent respiratory distress, a chest CT was ordered. The scan showed spots all over her lungs, so under the knife she went. Before she had even recovered from the anesthesia, we were informed that she had very aggressive cancer in both lungs. Pathology reveled that it was a recurrence of the cancer we thought she had beat in 2008.* 

&gt;*At this point, Jen is beginning chemotherapy. She faces a long road of deteriorating health before any relief can be expected. But she doesn’t face it alone and she maintains her positive, cheerful attitude. When informed that her hair would begin falling out within seventeen days of her first treatment, she grinned and replied, “I’ve got a rainbow Bozo-the-Clown wig just waiting to be worn and I’m gonna pencil some awesome tranny brows, maybe even rainbow to match.”*

&gt;*Jen, like her mother, has become a second mother and sister to dozens of lost and lonely souls throughout her life. It only takes one glance at the outpouring of support  during this time of uncertainty to understand how profoundly important she is to so many people.*  

&gt;*We honestly believe that a genuine Ellen encounter would change her life, lift her spirits, and contribute to her depleted reservoirs of hope and happiness. We know you receive millions of requests for such generosity, but we truly hope you’ll consider the journey of this amazing woman. Help us knock you off of her “bucket-list” and perhaps give her the experience of a lifetime. No one would appreciate it more.*

Thing is, it wasn't stolen, it was lost. Therefore, the police can't take it as evidence. The guy I bought it from is offering me my money back (good on him...). Cops say its between me and him.

Well, that's all fine and good, but it doesn't ensure that the original owner gets their kindle back.

This is my last chance, my last hope...I have nothing else to turn to, at the moment. 
My mother and father have hated each other for as long as I can remember, but we got along in a small apartment in Queens, Ny. It was a tiny, 2 bedroom apt for a family of 5; my mom, dad, and two sisters. We decided to expand.
We moved out to a pricey are in Suffolk County, the house worth about $870,000. my mom drained her pension into the house, while my dad contributed, some. We were doing fine.
Then, 2007 came along. And the stock market began to crash...as you know now, we are in an economic panic; the second worst economic crisis this country has ever since, albeit the Great Depression. 
Up until a few years ago, everything was fine...but the arguments began to intensify between my parents. My mom would accuse my dad of cheating, lieing, attempting to poison her, even! I always thought she was crazy....
Fastforward to last month. My dad dramatically leaves, his bags packed, off to live ""alone"" in an apt.
Fastforward to last week. Found out: dad has been cheating for over 5 years, his side of the family hated us, racially (called us the 'n' word and more behind our backs [mom is Hatian, dad Italian]). 
Fastforward to yesterday: my dad ""visited us"" kids. He stole $2000 of our morgatge money, which we are almost 3months late on. Stole. My dad stole money from us to we would foreclose. Our economic standings as it is is so horrific, that we've come close to starting the foreclosure process twice...
My mom comes to me, crying for help sometimes...but what do I say? I don't know about home owning...
My mom says my dad won't sign the ""quit to claim"" deed, which releases the house's ownership to her, and says he isn't paying for it anymore (WHICH HE ISNT). Without his signature...I dont know :\ 
Like I said before, my moms entire pension abd basic life savings is gone , into this money pit of a house. On top of IRS and bill collectors knocking down our door..
I dont know what to even expect from putting thus on reddit; I don't TRUELY expect anyone to hand over thier hard earned cash for us. If anything, this was a great vent...

She usually lives alone and a few days ago someone from meals on wheels came to visit her at her apartment as they usually do, and found her unconscious on the floor in front of a pool of bloody vomit; she spent the following dozen or so hours in coma and they found an ulcer in her stomach, it wasn't bleeding any more when they got to it and she is now stable and conscious, but it still a tricky situation because of her diabetes and generally frail health.

She has a sister &amp; nephew in WA and a niece in CA but she is pretty much alone in PA and my understanding is that none of them could visit her. Her only daughter and three grandchildren (including myself) are in Europe and we can not afford go see her (there's more to this and we all want her to be here with us, but life has been complicated for all of us).

We speak to her every day by calling the hospital reception and getting transferred to her room, but there's only so much communication that can get through this way; she doesn't hear well through the phone and often gets confused. She's lonely, in pain and I believe she's going through a lot of anxiety.

It would mean the world to us if someone in the area could pay her a visit, cheer her up and just really make her day, if you could bring flowers that would be even better, and if this is at all possible, we would be eternally grateful for a Skype session with her (with a webcam).

Anyway, one of my favorite college professors (and his wife--also one of my favorite professors!) have started a social media campaign to save his life! He needs a new liver due to complications from a genetic bleeding disorder. **The situation has recently gotten more dire, and the doctors have lifted the size requirement.** In their words today, this is ""urgent.""

I'm not even sure if this is kosher here, but I can't think of a more amazing community than reddit to try to find the right donor. I know we can do it.

I don't have the right words to describe exactly what's needed, but below is the info they've given, along with some links. **Please help if you can!**


--
Our friend, Joel Beeson, is on a liver transplant list due to complications from a genetic bleeding disorder. 

We were set to proceed with a living donor transplant from his brother, who was a perfect candidate, when the transplant center changed the age limit guidelines, and now his brother is no longer a donor option. 

Other members of our family either have the wrong blood type or are out of the age range. We are now reaching out to our community to seek a potential living donor candidate. 

The criteria for a living donor are the following:

* Good Health

* Type O (doesn’t matter if – or +)

* Between 18 and 55 years old

* ~~Similar Size to Recipient, or larger (Joel is 5’11”, 180 lbs.)~~ 


Additional info from the Cleveland Clinic:


The Donor:

* Must not be pregnant.

* Should not have any major medical or psychiatric problems, including dependence on drugs or alcohol.

* Must understand the risks of the surgery and follow instructions for short and long-term care after the donation.

* Does not need to be a blood relative of the recipient; spouses, friends, and even total strangers can donate part of their liver. The success rates are the same whether the donor is related or unrelated.

This is an unfolding event, but I just want everyone to see it. I will try to grab screens in case she gets loose with the delete key. Basically I admitted to some skepticism and everything blew up from there. 

Come see the drama!!

(also she accused me of PMing her a pic of my cock to a 17 y\o, I want justice to my slandered name)

Edit1; I can't figure out how to screen cap the entire page all at once so I just saved the whole page at different points. I will upload them to filedropper once I collect enough. And if anyone can tell me how to, or can screen cap themselves, I would greatly appreciate it.

Also, the only reason I am doing this is because \he\she slandered my main account in a damn scummy way and I want people like this scum to stop ruining a community that actually has some power to affect change. Or effect, can't remember.

Some new info I've uncovered, 

http://www.reddit.com/user/EyeWillCallYouOut

http://www.reddit.com/user/Jenn4TheWin

These seem to be accounts the scammer uses to pump up support for an outflow of money.

Another one I'm highly suspicious of is

~~http://www.reddit.com/user/Dysa~~

~~My theory is that Dysa is the scammers main account, and is helping to inflate intrest in giving the scammer money by saying he will match donations.~~ 

Dysa and I have had a few private talks and after some unfortunate threats, I have decided he is too charitable to be considered a suspect here. I would like to take this time to publicly apologize for falsely accusing him without any real proof, but in my defense I was trying to collect information and post responses at the same time that I may have been a little hasty. Below is a copy of the final message I sent him.

&gt;Dysa, I have gone through you account and it does not look like you are a scammer. I find no reason why you would be so generous and charitable whal at the same time trying to suck money out of the community.
So as it stands now, I will strike your name and admit I was wrong. But threatening to sue me and trying to post my info is not cool.
By all means tho, go ahead with both of those plans, I would actuauly enjoy seeing how far you could get with both matters. But at this point I will isue a public apology to you and clear your name as best as I can. I will also post this message for true trancparency.

1324633427.0,67,self.Assistance,nnsj3,I'm six days sober and my life is in the toilet. All I want for Xmas is a jump start on getting my life together. Most of this involves keeping warm.,itcanonlygetbetter,74,7,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/nnsj3/im_six_days_sober_and_my_life_is_in_the_toilet/,"The vital details: I am 24 years old and female. I live in New Mexico, about an hour south of the Colorado border. I will provide more specific information if anyone bites...

I have been drinking and using drugs with ever-increasing frequency since I was 11. I would consider myself an addict, although I have no physiological dependencies, just a deep, crippling feeling of emptiness that has caused me to use drugs and alcohol multiple times a day for several years. This has cost me more jobs, homes, and friends than I can count. Last week I was dragged to an AA meeting and was inspired to try and get my shit together. I've been spending every minute since with other people in the program, and, to my complete surprise, you can feel good without getting fucked up, and there are kind people who won't condemn you for your faults. I am optimistic and determined, but completely baffled.

Here is my situation:

* I have housing through the end of January. I'm hoping to come up with enough money over the next few weeks to pay February's rent. I do your typical broke-ass hippie stuff--I read tarot cards in coffee shops and before I ran out of materials I was doing caricatures.

* I am desperately looking for a job, but seeing as how I've been fired from every single job I've ever had, I have no references. I'm putting out about 2 applications a day, but no one is hiring until after the new year. A friend of mine who found a better job is trying to get her boss to give me her job at a consignment store.

* I do not drive. I only have a bicycle. I'm not afraid of distance and I ride an average of 15 miles a day as it is, but I'm in the high desert and as soon as the sun goes down the temperature is in the single-digits and I can't afford the proper clothing for this. It's hard to get a job when you must leave 40 minutes before dark to get home without getting frostbite. There are also no streetlights for the last two miles of my ride, and the road is in very poor condition. 

* I do not have any presentable clothing. The same friend who is trying to secure me a job is approximately my size and has promised to lend me whatever I need, bless her, but I'm going to need my own stuff and it may be awhile before I can spend money on clothing. (I need to take care of food/shelter first and foremost.)

* I have applied for food stamps. I spend the emergency stipend and the rest is still pending.

* I have literally no money, aside from a check for $100 that I can't cash because I have no identification and no bank account.

* I barely have phone access. Someone bought me a pre-paid phone but I only have $15 left on it and I'm afraid to use it in case I run out of time before a prospective employer calls me.

* I've been offered a flight home, but again, no ID, and no desire to go back there, especially since it would be walking right back into the people and situations that caused me to use drugs in the first place. I think my best shot at sobriety is to stay put.

All I've really got is my dog. This may sound stupid to all of you, but this time last year I was living in a school bus (no heat, no electricity) and her body heat was the only thing standing between me and a cold, lonely death. If I gave her up I could probably stay in a womens' shelter and not have to worry about rent, but I just can't. She is everything to me and I love her like she was my child. There is a pet food pantry every other Saturday at one of the local churches and so far she hasn't been much of an expense and is instrumental to my sanity.

Where do I begin? Or, should I say, how do I continue? Deciding to get clean was step one, but for the past few years my only priority has been making sure my dog is fed and getting fucked up, so from here I'm just kind of like ""?????????""

This week I'm house-sitting, so I will have computer/internet access through Christmas day. (This is where the $100 check came from. I was reaaally hoping they were going to leave cash but there you have it.) I can't believe anybody would let me stay in their house while they were out of state, but here I am and I am so thankful.

**I DO NOT WANT ACTUAL MONEY. I am an addict and I do not trust myself. If there was any way anyone could put time on my phone (I think as long as you have my phone number, you can call from anywhere with a credit card...), send me some cold-weather cycling gloves or warm socks, or send a check to the DMV so they'll send me a new ID.

He's already posted a link to the game in r/gaming but got little response.
I love my husband. He is a kind, simple, beautiful man who has provided for me the best he could and has always been a loving, patient partner. I couldn't ask for better. He'll probably be really mortified that I had to ask the INTERNETS to play his game and this has the potential to backfire in my face if he sees this post! He'll probably be really happy before that though, if he sees that a bunch of people played his last game.

I want to see the magic that reddit created for Doctors Without Borders happen for the charity partners on Live Below the Line!

Anyway, you should definitely donate to me or set up your own page. Who's with me?

Disclaimer: This is not meant to give me an accurate insight into what it's like to live like the extreme poor, but to raise awareness and money for charities that do a hell of a lot to end the problems they face.

Please read this.",mcphizzle66,66,8,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/wuksb/i_need_help_reddit_i_have_a_special_needs_child_a/,"I have never been one for asking for charity or assistance of any kind, but here goes.

As I said in the title, I have a special needs child, a newborn baby, and an unemployed wife. I am employed and I make enough money to keep us above water. However, we are living in a bug infested shithole apartment. The reason being is that we pay over $1000 a month for health insurance. My wife cannot get a job as she has to stay at home and tend to our children. 

I was involuntarily separated from the US Air Force after 9 years because they decided to cut back on people and I was picked for DOS Rollback. They separated me one month after my daughter was born. I was lucky as I was able to find a decent job month after I was out, but the transition and move drained our savings.

A little background on my son:
My son was born at 26 weeks and spend the first 109 days of his life in the NICU. He is 2 and a half years old now but struggles with cerebral palsey, autism, and a feeding tube. No daycare in the area will accept him due to his conditions. We work as hard as we can to make his life happy, but we are struggling right now to even make ends meet.

I'm not asking for much, and I know there are people that have it much worse than us. I just want to see if anyone out there would like to give us some assistance. I have been a redditor for a while and I have seen what you guys and gals are capable of. If you feel like this is unwarranted and want to downvote me into oblivion because I am asking for help, that's fine, it's your choice. I'm just hoping some kind soul will see this and reach out a helping hand. If you feel like you want to help, please message me.

We live in Hattiesburg, MS and we are looking for any type of monetary assistance to help get into a residence that would be more conducive to raising our family. We have a paypal, so I guess that is an option.

I'll post some pics of my children in the comments.

Edit 2: [People requested pics of me in uniform](http://imgur.com/a/yNYy4)

Edit 3: I have received a good many questions about this so I'll address it. My son's Cerebral Palsy is mild. He doesn't walk, but he crawls around great and can pull up on things to standing. His autism is also pretty mild as well. This all stems from a bleed in is brain shortly after birth (intraventricular hemorrhage). This caused him to have a buildup of fluid around his brain (hydrocephalus). He needed a surgery to install a VP shunt at about 3 and a half months old. He will have the shunt for the rest of his life and it will need to be dealt with as he grows. [A pic of his surgery incision for reference. Not graphic.](http://imgur.com/XGRIc) The feeding tube (g-tube) comes from him having an extreme oral aversion. This stems from having a vetalator tube down his throat for six weeks. He wouldn't eat anything by mouth until he was about a year and 9 months. All he eats now is crackers, yogurt, and he will drink pediasure. We also push vitamins and fatty foods (Oils, milk, etc...) through the tube in his stomach. We have been working like crazy trying to get him to eat. We pay for all of the pediasure out of pocket (and it's not cheap). He has been in PT and OT since he was a year and a half old. Hope that answers any questions on him. If you have any more feel free to ask.

I would also like to openly say I appreciate /u/sqwirk and all the time they have spent going over my Resume with me, sincerely I appreciated the hand.

Here going out, I am pretty sure I should be fine, everything is stable... for the most part and I can rebuild my savings hopefully. I got a job at a department store after several interviews. They said it looked like I was eager to work and offered me a Job making more than I was making as a sales men and well above the living wage of Massachusetts.

Longterm:
I have gotten a job offer from a company outside the States and maintained a solid connection with them. I am on good terms with them and I am doing contract work for them currently, doing animations for software they are developing, I have heard talks of being hired after it's over. So hopefully that works out.

Both of these opportunities sprung up very recently. Weird how things can change so quickly.

I also had a connection to a job, that wasn't anywhere near me, so I couldn't take it and handed it to a friend in Ohio who has been looking to come back home. He interviewed and got the job that had originally been offered to me, So he will be able to bring his wife and daughter back home to family. So I feel like I also passed forward the recent help I have been given.

I have no health insurance and tend to let a lot of things go unless they hinder me from working. A few days go by and it is still swollen and I feel especially shitty. I have high blood pressure and have had other problems in the past so I never really feel very good. I have gotten by at the times I haven't had insurance by going to clinics but the quality of care there is quite poor. I was told once that the only way I could even apply for help from the state was if I were pregnant.
I go to work and I notice an itch on my lip. Oh no a cold sore! I've only had 2 other cold sores in my life and am pretty sure an old roommate gave it to me when he kissed me with open sore years ago. I've heard that a cold sore usually only pop up when your immune system is down. I figure I must be really sick and I should get my ass to the doctor. I tell my boss/roommate/friend of 11 years that I really think I should go to the doctor today.
I manage to get an appointment at an office I'd been to once before that takes cash and is fairly reasonable. I was probably his last appointment of the day. He says go to the emergency room. He doesn't know what's going on just looking at it from the outside and all the techs at their office are gone. He doesn't charge me for the visit and continues to make me promise I'll go to an emergency room where they can look at it from the inside.
My friend takes me to the emergency room. They order a CT and after they look at it they come back and the first thing he said was ""It's not good"". I had an aortic dissection. I will post some links with better explanations but basically there were tears in the main artery of my heart and it was splitting...about to burst open and I was going to bleed to death on the inside. I don't feel like getting into to many more extreme details now. It was very frightening. It is a rare thing that usually happens to people late in life and is rarely caught before it kills you. It has an 80% mortality rate and is actually what killed John Ritter. He was diagnosed with a heart attack they did no images and he bleed to death on the inside.
They gave me the choice of going north or south as their people did not feel they were qualified to handle it(I totally agree especially after the care I ended up receiving before my transfer). I chose north to OSU. Turned out to be an excellent choice. Everyone there was wonderful. The care there was excellent on every level. I got there in the evening and had surgery @8:30 am the next morning.
My friend I mentioned before is by my side the whole time. She is like a mother figure to me in some ways. My own mother has just recently passed away and we had been estranged. My friend tells me not to worry. I can still live with her and her husband while I get better. They will help me as we know that if I receive assistance there will be a gap between my last paycheck and the start of this assistance. She brings me home after 11 days in the hospital. The whole staff agrees I'm doing better than they've ever seen anyone recover. I don't need rehab/home help/or anything like that.
At first when I get home her and her husband are freaked out about me doing anything. I shouldn't be doing cartwheels but it's just as bad to lie in bed. I try and explain this to them. Well to her really. Her husband would be called eccentric if they were rich. I think we have that worked out and then a day later right before a phone interview with one of my assistance things he comes and tells me that I have to leave. She won't ruin her marriage over me. That she loves me and will help me any way she can and walks off. I'm shocked and even more upset that she'd tell me right before my interview. Turns out her husband is freaked out that I have oral herpes...and that's why he wants me gone.
Heart surgery is very traumatic. I was very emotional after mine. Euphoric and grateful to be alive. Plus I'd been living in that dying body so long it had even more impact on me. Prior to the surgery I had been a worrier...for as far back as I had memories. They picked up on this the day they were going to discharge me because my vitals signs,especially my blood pressure would not stabilize. They put me on a nerve pill...it helped stabilize my emotions and my body.
Since my friend asked me to leave my recovery is going backwards. I'm scared. It seems everyone else I know that could take me in doesn't have the room. I have no way to get more money and will run out of my prescriptions in about 2 weeks. I am still in a lot of pain and the stress of all this is not helping. I don't have the much energy to try and figure out ways to help myself. I was so happy and so looking forward to six months from now when I'd be healed. If anyone reads this thank you. I feel a tiny bit better writing some of it out and throwing it into the universe...like a message in a bottle.
I need help of all kinds. I have been through a lot of tough times in my life but this definitely tops them all.
I live near Dayton,Ohio. Received my surgery and care afterwards @Ohio State and there are not adequate words to describe what a great team of people work there. They are true healers and everyone I encountered there showed me compassion and seemed genuinely concerned with my comfort/care/and healing. I could never thank them enough.
No I do not have any insurance btw. Have applied for medicaid but has not kicked in yet as I have just now gathered all the paperwork they require. Am in the process of applying for other assistance as well. Even if I am approved for these things it will be months probably. I need help right now so I can relax and heal. 
I want nothing more than to heal and I know I will be in probably the best shape I've been since my late teens. That is when my health problems began. I'm afraid I won't make it there because of all this stress and drama. My recovery already seems too be moving backward because of it. If I've rambled here I'm sorry on a lot of medication.

There was recently a popular thread on AskReddit asking amputees about their daily lives and what it was like to live without limbs.  The top comment was made by user [sweetxjosie](http://reddit.com/user/sweetxjosie) here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10iiud/amputees_of_reddit_what_was_it_like_to_lose_a/c6dtblg

Sweetxjosie was rushed to the hospital after experiencing complications of what seemed to be a sinus infection – it was, in fact, much more severe.  After several strokes and the rupture of her femoral artery, sweetxjosie woke up in the hospital four months later with both legs amputated and little to no memory of what had happened.  She is only 25.  She was at first diagnosed with Lemierre's Syndrome, although doctors are now uncertain about that diagnosis.  With her permission, I wanted to help her share her story.

Sweetxjosie posted an extremely touching [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10iiud/amputees_of_reddit_what_was_it_like_to_lose_a/c6dy1bk) in the thread:

“I'm about to get real with all of reddit, so sorry in advance.

I'm sad. I'm so so so so so sad. I'm only 25, and now this is my life. Most days, I don't even want to get out of bed. I'm getting pretty good at putting on a front, but its so fake, and those that are close to me can tell. I sit in front of my computer every single day. I've been trying to get prosthetic legs and a wheelchair accessible van that I can drive for months now, but I have no money, no savings, no insurance, and medicaid has denied me 3 times now. I hate going out in public because I'm tired of catching stares. The majority of my friends can't be bothered to drive all the way to my mothers house, where I live, so I spend most of my time alone.

But thank you for the positive vibes. If anyone needs them, it's definitely me.”

I’ve seen Redditors do incredible things to help strangers.  I followed the story of 3-year-old Lucas, whose family needed support as Lucas waited for a bone marrow transplant; and the story of Caleb, who was shot in the Aurora, Colorado massacre.  Let’s do it again and help sweetxjosie.

1345158035.0,60,self.Assistance,ycgyh,Man who provides low-income families and young children with access to Linux and computers has cancer; needs your help.,zfk,71,11,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ycgyh/man_who_provides_lowincome_families_and_young/,"My name is Diane and Ken is my Life-Partner. I will probably be posting for him from time to time due to his eyes not being able to tolerate the backlight of the monitor. He is down to about 20 minutes a day here because the backlight makes him terribly sick.

As many of you know, Ken's cancer has just recently begun to spread to his right lymph node but his Oncologist has assured us that this is 80 percent curative if he gets the needed surgery in time. Unfortunately, his 1100 dollar a month SSI disability disqualifies him for Medicaid and the local county low-income insurance he was receiving. This leaves us with about 2 weeks to either raise enough money for at least the OR for the surgery (we are hopeful of finding a surgeon to do the work pro bono) or raise enough money for the entire procedure. We've spent hours upon hours researching and contacting the links some of you have provided but they are so limited in scope that 90 percent o
f them are not helpful at all.

We are looking at two weeks, maybe three before the cancer spreads past the point of surgery being an option. After that, we've been told just to make him as comfortable as possible until he passes. I'm not ready to accept that.

I know it's a lot of money but recently a bus monitor was donated over a half million dollars in donations for being harassed by a bus full of children. We only need to raise a fraction of that. I think if the Linux community pulls together, we can make this happen. I have heard about a site called Reddit that might be able to help but I have no idea how to access it or post to it. Does anyone have a Reddit account that could pass this news along?

Thomas A. Knight has put up a page that tells Ken's story and he's volunteered to host the fund raising page for this effort. Please help us by a small donation and spreading the word. Ken's done magnificent work for the past 7 years in getting Linux computers into the hands of poor children. I'm just hoping that the community at large sees enough value in Ken to help him beat this monster. Because, as it looks now, you are about the only hope he has.

See Thomas' page here. If the page times out, just hit F5 and it will connect, just be patient and from the bottom of my heart, thank you.

My name is Shawn Myers; I live in Nanticoke, Pennsylvania. [This](http://i.imgur.com/ib0yJ.jpg) is my dog Gypsy. She is a 10 year old Daschund (aka Weiner Dog) that last night I had to rush to the E.R. Two weeks ago, she seemed to be in discomfort while walking around my house. She wouldn’t pick up her head, she would cry and pant, and wouldn’t try to go down steps. Upon a visit to the vet they diagnosed her with having injured her back; this is very common with these dogs due to their length of body, along with their tiny legs. 
After 2 weeks of medication I brought her inside from a bathroom break, and went on to do homework in my room. About five minutes later I heard a loud bang, and a howling puppy. I rushed into the room to see her lying on her side with her legs not moving. When trying to check her legs to see if she had broke something I realized she couldn’t move them at all; at that point I thought she had been paralyzed.

I rushed her to a local animal hospital near me and checked her in. After mounds of paperwork and tears thinking the worst, the worst seemed to happen. They informed me that on a scale of back injury for dogs from 1-5 she was a four on the brink of 5, meaning she was nearly paralyzed. The scans showed that she had a bulged disc in her spine that was putting pressure on the spinal cord. 

My option now is to have her get surgery; the exact procedure is known as a laminectomy. This involves removing a portion of her vertebra to widen the spinal canal. A full detail can be found here: [Laminectomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminectomy). I decided that I needed to go forward with the surgery, as last January (2011), I lost my mom after a hard fought cancer battle. This dog was her baby, next to me, and the real only living memory I have of her. It was her everything. Myself, I am a hardworking college student at Full Sail University in the Music Production program. I work a full time job that basically goes towards interest on my college loans and bills. To pay for this surgery, I had to apply for a credit card at a high interest rate (15%). The procedure itself can cost up to 4,000$ to perform; I had to put 3,100$ down for them to even commit her in the surgical center. 
Reddit, I am asking you to help me raise money to save the best friend that I have: the one who loves me no matter what, and the one who reminds me of the person I miss the most. I will provide whatever proof anyone needs to validate this. Any funds, no matter how small, will help me not go into complete debt to save the one I love. Below I have links to pictures and the bill for her. 

If Reddit helps me with the cost of this procedure for me, I will get the Reddit alien walking a Daschund on my forearm. 

With Love,
Shawn Myers and Gypsy Myers

**tl;dr** 
I need to raise 4,000$ to cover my dog's surgery she needs to be able to walk again. I love this dog with all I have, and she is everything to me. Any funds can help.

We only need 400 more dollars until two things. 1) We have successfully paid for Gypsy's surgery/care costs at the facility. 2) I will be getting the Reddit alien tattoo at a local shop whom I talked to today about, and they will be doing it at a charity rate :) &lt;3**

**8:15AM 1/25/2012: Ladies and gentlemen, Gypsy comes home today! (if all goes well) I am 200$ short of fully paying off the bill.

Great day everyone  ! &lt;3**

**Edit: Corrected 300$ to 200$, I forgot to add a local donation from a friend :)**

**1/26/2011: Hello all, Thank you for all the kind words in support of Gypsy. She is in a lot of pain, and I feel bad because while expressing her bladder yesterday she got a sharp jolt of pain :/ I never thought it would be so hard to keep my composure during this. I'm a nervous wreck. These 3 weeks can't come soon enough when the doctors expect she will start to move her legs a little again. I will keep updating this page. Thank you &lt;3**


** Tattoo pic! [Tattoo](http://i.imgur.com/l3rFx.jpg) Thank you Reddit Community**

1/27/2012: This is getting hard. She seems so helpless in her cage. I just wish she would pop up and walk around to let me know all will be OK. I just got done doing her therapy exercises to keep the blood flowing to her legs while her back heals. It makes her so uncomfortable so we wait an hour or so after her meds are given. The tattoo is looking awesome. Can't wait for it to heal up so I can put my arm down hehe. Also! the 200$ I needed was funded this morning by a donor I work with. So all of her original surgery costs are covered! We did it!!!! If I get any additional money it will be used for her follow up appointments (apparently there is a few), and supplies (pee pads for the cage). The big thing I am looking forward to is giving her a nice bath when the staples come out. Unfortunately with her not moving much she lays in her own urine, we clean as much as we can as the doctor ordered, but its still messy. I will keep updated, thank you all!

1/28/2012: Gypsy is having an OK day today. She seems to be in a little pain since she is panting a lot. We started to take her outside to go to the bathroom so she gets uncomfortable when we do so. I am getting nervous since when Misty (my schnauzer) walks into the room she tends to growl. I am hoping it is her protecting herself and her food. Thank you all.

1/31/2012: Gypsy wagged her tail for a few seconds today! First it's moved since before she got hurt! Ahhhh life's good.

2/1/2012: SHE MOVED HER LEG!!! She was stretching in her cage, she moved her leg out then back in. This is a great feeling!!!!!",,False,,t5_2s25d,True,,heart registered,True,t3_ot57m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ot57m/reddit_please_help_me_help_my_best_friend/,

A very kind Redditor helped me make a little google site for my fundraiser! https://sites.google.com/site/stovebychristmas/


.

In the midst of having her two oldest children move out, my mom has been coping with her newfound spare time by cooking **ALL OF THE TIME, FOR EVERYONE!** Most of our appliances are pretty up-to-date... but our stove is a dinosaur. It's small and lopsided, and it takes at least ten minutes to heat up. It's one that has raised cooking rings, which are all tilted and wobbly. There are chipped and burned spots from where my (brilliant) older brother accidentally melted a silver cooking pot on not only the stove, but all over the counter and sink, too.


.

My mom dreams of a fabulous kitchen makeover in the same way that some people wish to win the lottery. So, this Christmas, I want to surprise her with the sleek new stove she’s been dreaming of!


.

My goal is **$500 by Christmas**-- about $300 short of what the estimation for the stove will actually be. 


.

**Long story short, I'm trying to buy my mom a stove for Christmas, so I'm drawing YOUR GORGEOUS BEING for only $2!**


.

Buy one for yourself! Buy one for you mom and dad! Buy one for your grandma! Buy one for your dog! Buy one for ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS! Buy one for your family and send it out as a Christmas card! Buy one for each of your friends and use them as trading cards! Buy them for your pets and use them to brag about what beautiful domesticated animals you have!


.

All you have to do is send pictures of who/what you want drawn to **ashleyhollaback@gmail.com!** Each person/animal is **$2**, so if you send me a picture of you and your dog, it will be $4 total!


.

**TURN THIS (http://i40.tinypic.com/2rclo4i.jpg ) &gt;&gt; INTO THIS (http://i43.tinypic.com/anfuw7.png )**

**OR TURN THIS (http://i44.tinypic.com/kafxn4.png ) &gt;&gt; INTO THIS (http://i43.tinypic.com/vqk08x.png )**


.

If this works (and I’m hoping it will!) I’ll only have to draw **250** of these bad mamma-jamma’s by Christmas/New Years (that’s about 10 a day!)


.

Please shoot me an e-mail at **ashleyhollaback@gmail.com** if you’re interested in ordering one or two or two-hundred-fifty of these awesome little cartoons! The money will be sent through Paypal, I’ve got a fundraiser going on **HERE (https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=AAFFERYDVFNYJ&amp;lc=US&amp;item_name=New%20Stove%20by%20Christmas%21&amp;item_number=9090434&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted )**, where you can pay for your drawing or donate (even if you don’t have a Paypal account!).

I don't post over at /r/food_pantry because I don't have an old enough account after deleting my old account which was used mainly for depression and suicide support.

Anyways, three years ago and one year apart, I lost my high school sweetheart and later my college boyfriend to suicide and a car accident respectively.  Since then I have tried counseling, grief groups, religion, spiritual life groups, drawing, writing, getting together with their families, etc to try to make it better. Nothing worked. 

I dropped out of college after a nervous breakdown, was institutionalized for a few days and was later kicked out of my parents' house for ""not even trying to be happy"".  

My dog is the only thing keeping me going. I have had little success keeping a job due to my depression, suicidal thoughts and anxiety.  He is my entire world and I can't imagine leaving him alone to be put back in a shelter or worse.  

I have finished selling off anything of value and an pretty much at the point of prostitution on CL in order to buy food, pay rent, etc.  I've done a few part time gigs to get through the past few months and am waiting on food stamps which will require an interview in about two weeks before the approval process begins.

Right now, I want to live, for him. Tomorrow? I don't know. All I know it that I am down to one package of bacon ends which I'll split with him, some boxed gravy, two boxes of potato flakes and a few condiments.

If anyone is willing to help financially just to pull me through til the food stamps kick in I would be forever indebted to you. I can sing. I can make you an audio file. I can doodle. I'll send you pictures. Seriously, it's that bad. 

I have a Walmart within walking distance to me so that is my best bet as I don't currently own a car.  Any other ideas are also greatly appreciated as the need is immediate.

Details inside.",SomberJester,67,11,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/14f9l7/reddit_no_one_is_sick_or_dying_but_im_desperate/,"Where to begin?

Here is the back story: My mother, and I, moved to Michigan in July of 2010, to open a clothing store in her home town.

 I came along to help in anyway I could (plus I had my own reasons for getting away). My father stayed behind in Oklahoma, and agreed to send money to help open the business, get started, etc.

 The arrangement was supposed to be she lived up here during the summer (tourist season), and live down there in the winter (ghost town). It was supposed to be a joint-venture between the two of them, (or three of us, I suppose.)

After a few months, my father stopped sending money. I should add that this man is a doctor, with virtually NO big expenses, his kids are all adults, he owns his vehicle, etc. Soon after that, my mother found out about some girlfriend he had, and confronted him. My father, being the person he is, flipped out and said he wanted a divorce. He said he didn't owe her anything after 30+ years of marriage, and cut her off completely. 

After that, the store has been hanging by a thread, as we were relying on him doing his part (which he not only agreed to, but pushed us to come up here).

 I don't know how much detail I can give regarding the divorce, because it is still ongoing, but he has fought bitterly the entire time, pulling all kinds of dirty tricks (even resorting to dragging MY name through the mud in court).

 For a short time, he paid a temporary alimony, which was a fraction of what he agreed to send to get us here. Even that he only paid when he felt like it. And again, that only lasted a few months until the next hearing. 

That next hearing was cancelled, and the judge for some reason hasn't renewed the temporary order, despite knowing what position she is in. 

Every hearing since has been cancelled, AFTER we spent every dollar we had to get down there. This latest one was supposed to be last week, but now he is dodging servers, and no one knows where he is.

There's a lot to this situation so please bare with me. The last three years have been a blur of survival mode, so forgive me if it seems disjointed. I'm trying to paint the whole picture here. Please PM if something doesn't make sense or if you have any questions.

Anyway, during our first year here, my mother slipped on some ice and managed to break her back. She's not paralyzed or anything, and thank god she was able to get my father's insurance to help, but she can't work due to chronic pain. 

Shortly after that, I decided to try and raise some money, and started a blog to sell off all of my stuff. I even called in to a popular podcast to promote it. I did receive a bit of help, and my pride was still somewhat intact because I was selling things. I didn't have much, though, and ultimately I only raised maybe $130 or so. Still, I am eternally grateful.

After that, I moved out of my apartment, and into the back of the store. I lived in the office for a summer, until I was able to get another place, although I'll probably lose that soon.

Now, though, things have petty much come to a head, and I am out of ideas (not to mention energy). 

We are backed up on everything, we have borrowed money from the only people we know here, and I'm simply lost. I have been looking for extra work all over, but those in Michigan know how that can be. Not even taco bell has called me back (at 31, you can imagine what that does to one's self image). 

I was turned down for food assistance because I went to school this semester. Apparently here in Michigan, it's eat, or school, can't have both. (Trying very hard not to sound bitter). 

Next week, I do have a ""group pre-screen interview"" at a job an hour away. Not sure how I'm even going to get there, and even if I get the job, it's an hour away.

My mother, meanwhile, is not doing well at all. I am, frankly, extremely worried about her emotional well being. This store is her livelihood, and it's truly the only thing she has. She has been a homemaker for 30+ years, and even if not for her back, no one will even consider hiring her.

 We have both tried everything! She is still waiting to hear from SSA about disability. This is truly our darkest hour, and I am just so tired. I am now relying on the generosity of you fine people (I can't say the ""generosity of strangers,"" because over the last year or so, reddit has really kept me sane, and for that alone, I thank you all).

If I can raise $25,000, somehow, I know we will make it through the winter. That's just to make it to summer, after that I really don't know, it's difficult to think that far ahead when I'm just trying to keep afloat until next week.

I will be adding as much detail as I can throughout tonight and tomorrow. My mother is asleep at the moment, so I'm doing this all on my own for now. Here is a current list of backed up expenses:

Rent for the store, 2 months behind at $1,150 per month: $2,300

My mother's apartment rent, 2 months behind at $700 per month: $1,400

Sales tax is at $1,000

Electricity for my place, the store and my mother's apartment: $200

Insurance on the store: $200

Internet (we also need this to run credit cards if there is a sale): $237.11

My rent, 4 months behind, at $550 per month: $2200
(My own expenses are the least important, as I will be willing to move in with my mother if need be. I just want her to be okay.)

Total of just the backed up expenses: $7,537.11

Now, that's just to get caught up. There are virtually no sales during the winter, so I am also trying to raise enough to see us through, hence the $25,000 figure. That's a huge number, but if enough people help just a little, I know it can be done. Please, reddit. I'm pretty desperate right now. Again, if anyone has any questions, or if I'm not doing this right, please PM me.

EDIT: Okay, I put together an indiegogo page:
http://igg.me/p/291559/x/1868672

UPDATE: Just received a $50 donation! Thank you so much!

UPDATE 2: It's now 220 am here, and I need to go home and get some shuteye. I will be back first thing in the morning, and will continue updating.

UPDATE 3: Okay, I'm back on. It's 1100am, and we're up to $240 overnight! My mother found out this morning what I was up to, and just keeps saying how amazed she is that there are people out there like you all. So thank you so much for that!

**12/11 UPDATE 4:** At $265. I will be moving out by the end of the month, so that should knock off a bit. The landlord for the store stopped by today, and said he would give us two weeks to come up with $500, and that we could pay $500 every two weeks after that. If not, we'll have to close. If the store closes, I really don't know what will happen. I also have a job interview on Thursday, an hour away, so if that works out, it could be a big help. I will continue to update. In the meantime, if anyone has any advice on getting this more views, please let me know. Thanks again all!

",inneedofopportunity,59,2,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/o0693/dignity_out_the_window_20s_yo_male_seeks/,"crosspost from http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/o01rr/dignity_out_the_window_does_the_land_of/

I have no clue where to begin. This is extremely difficult to put into words as it is an accumulation of several years/events that I still have problems facing. I feel that my resources have been extended beyond their means.

I am a early-20's y/o male, living in the southeast US. Throughout high-school, medical problems were a constant issue (dx of ulcerative colitis and Eosinophilic Esophagitis my freshman year, just to name two). Multiple semesters I was considered ""disabled"" due to the severity of my ulcerative colitis (this involved being placed on the home-bound program and home-schooled by the county school system for cumulatively half of my high-school enrollment). I graduated with a very respectable GPA (4.xx+) and received multiple scholarship offers. I spent my freshman year living at a private university ranked amongst the nations best in major. After a year of university studies, I decided to change my major from pharmacy to double in business/humanities and then transferred to a local community college (this was after being told by my father that changing my initial major was the most devastating thing I could have done, short of coming out of the closet, and that he would no-longer support my education financially). At this point, I moved back in with my parents and completed a semester at community college. 11/2009 I dropped out of college and secured a job about an hour away. My moving out was ultimately the collaboration of my fathers substance abuse and my mothers enabling it.

My father was an alcoholic/narcotics abuser on a daily basis for the past 20 years and this was not brought to face until I moved out of my parents house in fall 2009 (despite my efforts to bring this to family attention for years beforehand). My moving out in November spurred my father to check himself into a rehabilitation center the upcoming January (2010). From 11/09-01/11 I was able to maintain employment but my medical issues began to resurface, eventually disallowing me to adhere to my work schedule.

In July of 2011, my girlfriend and I moved back to my home town due to resurfacing of my health problems. This was a very large leap of faith for me, as I acting upon a promise made by my parents to help reestablish myself. Since moving back, I have had two jobs for less than a month each, both situations it being mutually understood at my time of quitting that I could not continue working under my medical conditions.

My medical issues have made it impossible to find work locally. I have tried several online job-search sites along with exhausting personal contacts, local resources, etc. My ""average"" day consists of chronic nausea, gastrointestinal pain/odor, and unpredictable bowel movements (avg 15/day).

I have applied for medicaid and was denied (reapplying). I have applied for ss disability and am still awaiting response. I have filed unemployment and am still awaiting response. I do receive food stamps. No savings/checking (have sold everything to my name over the last months to buy time). Full tank of gas.

All I need is an opportunity. Be it, an opportunity to move 400 miles out of the way and run somebodies cafe from an attic apartment, or just a stable job that can accommodate my medical issues. I need a stay-at-home/telecommunications job, or job that allows an individual to work on their own schedule/15+ bathroom trips per day. I am willing to work any job/task, full or part-time, as long as I have continuous/immediate access to alleviate myself. I will literally jump in my car and drive to California tomorrow if the promise of stability is there.

Ask questions, because I have left years of answers out.

tldr - Intelligent, motivated 20-something year old seeking an employment/life opportunity which allows flexible scheduling and constant/immediate restroom access.  Any ideas, suggestions, help, etc would be great.

My family out here in California just got word from my Florida relatives that my grandfather (mom's dad) might be gone within the week. He's been undergoing chemo treatment for cancer and has taken a rather sudden turn for the worse. Tickets from Southern California to Jacksonville are about $300 - $500. If someone (or someones) were to loan me the money for a ticket, I could pay it back in monthly installments over about six to nine months, with reasonable interest if you like. I'm a rather active redditor, so I'm not going anywhere. [Here's a link to a loan I got once and paid back on time](http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/mn6ip/paid_maggieed_paid_back_on_time_5_interest_which/) and [here's a link to my 100% positive ebay feedback profile.](http://feedback.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFeedback2&amp;userid=maggieed84) Also, [here's a link to my 5 year old twitter account](https://twitter.com/#!/margaret_crymes) so you know I'm a real human.

Alternatively, if someone had the airline mileage points to spare, we could work out some kind of a purchase or trade. Or maybe there's even a redditor who works for an airline and can get me a companion ticket.

Thanks to family drama on my father's side of the family I never got to say goodbye to my paternal grandfather--I couldn't even go to his funeral. I didn't even know he was gone until years later, when my father finally contacted me and told me.

The last time I saw my Granddaddy (my dying maternal grandfather) was at my wedding nearly three years ago. And that was only the fifth or sixth time I've been able to see him since my family left the east coast 12 years ago. 

Help me please, reddit-wan Kenobi. Barring a rich uncle that I've somehow never met, you're my only hope. 

**EDIT:** Thanks to the amazing generosity of one redditor (possibly two, waiting to hear back), I'm about halfway to having enough to buy a plane ticket. I only need about $200-$300 now. He's in the hospital as I type, so it means a lot that anyone would help. 

**EDIT 2:** r/Assistance, you are amazing. I've got more than half of what I need now. Another $100-$200 will get me across the country. Thank you to everyone, from the little loans to the big. It means the world to me. I barely have the words to show my gratitude other than ""Thank you, thank you, thank you."" 

**EDIT 3 (01/03/2012 11:43 a.m.):** Just got another $25, so I'm down to needing between $75-$175. Reddit, you're amazing.

**EDIT 4 (1/04/2012 10:27 a.m.):** He's progressed (degressed?) to the point where he's basically only alive on a ventilator. They're only keeping him on it until Friday, in order to give the far-flung family time to get there, so if he wakes up at all, that'll be it. He'd actually been fighting the cancer pretty well, but then he got pneumonia and it all went downhill, so it was kind of sudden and none of us were really prepared to fully lose him. He and my grandmother would have celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary this June.

But, Reddit? You've given/loaned me what I need to be there. I cannot express my gratitude enough. I'm booking my flight today and I should be there in time. There's a chance he'll wake up even just a little when they take him off the ventilator, and it's looking like he'll be surrounded by his children and grandchildren when he goes. Your generosity of spirit means the world to me, to my family, and--were he capable of expressing it--to my grandfather too. It may just be because I'm losing my last grandfather, but I think some of these tears are tears of thanks for this community. 

I'll update y'all on how it goes.

For their Christmas/Birthdays this year I am losing their home. 

I used to work as as a Case Manager for homeless families, but after the birth of my second son and a crippling injury, I left to start my own Photography and Graphic Design business. We were doing OK; that was before the economy collapsed. Work has been few and far between for a while now and I find myself in the same position as my former clients. Our finances have dried up, we've used up any savings we had; we've been struggling along, but have come to the end of the line. We have always made our own way, but now find that failing. 

We went on welfare last month, but that only provides $809/month plus foodstamps. We can no longer afford our $1800/month home and we have no savings to move and we couldn't find a place that's affordable on our welfare anyways. We have till the middle of December to move out without owing the landlord any money and our power gets shut off on Dec. 13th.

We are hoping someone out there is willing to help us obtain or be willing to donate an RV, camper, motor home, van or some such similar vehicle for our family to retreat to and regroup. It doesn't need to be fancy or pretty, just run. 

I have researched used RVs on Craigslist in my area and there are number of them for $1500 and under. Assistance to keep me in my home would be substantially more than that and it would be pointless as I would be in the same situation again next month. Vehicular living seems to be the only viable solution to keep my family off the streets next week. The shelter system here has hundreds of families on the waiting list for the some 59 spots at the local shelters; wait time is 4-6 months, we aren't likely to get in before spring or summer.

We know it seems like we're asking for a lot, but it would be immensely helpful in keeping my family warm and dry this winter. Additionally we are open to any other ideas - perhaps someone would be willing to rent a studio to us for a little less than our welfare check or ???. We would be eternally grateful to any angel that can offer any help/ideas at all. Thank you for reading.

This is a bit of a longer read, I tried editing it but I also don't want to leave any information out. Thanks in advance for reading.

I'm turning to you to make something very special happen for my dad as my own resources have run out. My dad (70) was diagnosed with Stage 2A Pancreatic Cancer about 7 months ago. He has had surgery to remove a 3.6cm tumour from his Pancreas and is now taking oral chemotherapy drugs. For the most part, he is on the mend, but his health is nowhere near where is was when this all started. It was a huge wakeup call for him and the rest of our family, but he has changed a lot and definitely has a lot more he wants to do before he ""kicks the bucket"" or so he likes to say.

One of the things he really wants to do is to travel to Argentina. He has a lot of friends who have travelled before and it's been on his bucket list for the past 20 years or so. He is not the ""spend money on himself"" type of guy so would never do this type of thing on his own, but I know that it would make him extremely happy and lift his spirit 100% if I could do this. I am DETERMINED to make this happen for him. Someone is going to buy my Macbook Pro tomorrow, so I am already €1200 in, which means I am about €1300 short. We wouldn't be staying in expensive, lavish hotels, and we wouldn't be going there for shopping by any means, it's just to experience the culture and see a beautiful slice of this planet that he has never seen before. A friend of a friend of a friend (and so on) can help me out with cheap flight tickets.

Bit of a back story: I moved away from Germany when I was 19. I wanted to see other places and just....get away. My dad has always been a working man...a proud guy. We were close but we never really had those typical ""father and son"" moments. It changed a bit when I moved to Canada, him and my mum would visit me once a year for 3 weeks. Eventually I realized that I had missed out on a lot of quality time, especially when our relationship improved (I should note that there wasn't any particular event in my life that led to us not being close, it just never happened...or my expectations were just too high, god knows). So, last year I moved back (Amsterdam) and I am glad I did. We're talking on a daily basis, we're doing stuff, he's finally opening up to me (he never spoke about his feelings before). Things are great.

I do fully understand that there are tons of people on here that need help far more than I do. Which is why I would pay every cent back if needed, I think people can leave notes in Paypal transactions, so if anyone decides to help me towards reaching my goal + they'd like their money back PLEASE let me know and I won't let you down. I am scraping together whatever I can to get as far as possible by myself, but the bottom line is that I do need some help.

I'm asking you, the Reddit community, to help make this a reality for my dad as we aren't sure if this is the last time he'll be well enough to make the trek and I don't want him to miss out on this oppourtunity. If you have even a dollar or two that you can spare, I've set up a Chip-In page **[HERE](http://atripwithdad.chipin.com)** as I want to show you guys the progress and I have also posted a photo of him there. We'll even send you a postcard or bring back a tiny souvenir for you if you want! There will for sure be a big picture dump as well as many updates from the road. 

So please, if you can, help me do this for my dad. He is a very good man, has worked hard all his life and needs something like this but I'm not able to do it without a little help.

Thank you for reading, and if you can't / won't help me out please turn around and give your dad a hug today. He won't be around forever.

Much love everyone!

**TLDR Version:** My Dad has cancer, trying to take him on the trip of a lifetime before I won't be able to and I need your help.

**EDIT**: I am very sorry that this post is so long, but as I stated in the comment below I am trying to provide as much info as possible. Also, IF I happen to go way past my goal I will donate the rest of the money to other cancer related stuff on here, I will be asking you guys for input if it comes to it + post screen shots of my Paypal as proof.

We both were on the receiving ends of breakups last year, and decided that whilst young, free, single and spontaneous, we wanted to do something really awesome that would truly tear us out of our safe realms of our comfort zones in exchange for new experiences.
Anyway, cutting straight to the chase; Nathan has never left the country. He's a little older than me, 25 - and has never travelled any further than Wales. Since breaking up with his ex, he's wanted nothing more than to explore the world - and with my new-found spontaneity since my breakup, we both decided to spend a month touring the USA, coast to coast, to meet new people, new stories, new weather and (hopefully) some awesome experiences. We're planning on flying to Vancouver to stay with one of Nathan's friends for a few days to rest up and get our bearings together, then hiring a car and travelling from the West coast to the East coast, stopping at as many places as we can along the way. 
This is (hopefully…!) where Reddit comes in; we want to experience as much as possible - everything from the totally normal to the completely abnormal, so if you know maybe a good club/pub to get a drink, somewhere we can get something amazing to eat, a place to stay - or even something truly unusual and out of the ordinary - it would be really amazing if you could give us a bit of a guided tour around your town. We're not going to say no to anything if we arrive in your town (within reason, of course…) as this whole expedition is really meant to blast us well out of our comfort zones to experience things we hadn't even imagined.

With us being grads from a filmmaking course, and currently working in the media industry, we both also decided that it would be kind of awesome to film the whole experience and edit it together for the amusement of ourselves, friends and family; which will be uploaded after the whole expedition for Reddit's entertainment. We also plan to send anyone involved a DVD with everything on it as a little way of saying thank-you!

So if you know somewhere, something or someone awesome to visit, see, meet or do, you live somewhere in America and think you could put up with our somewhat annoyingly thick British accents - then we would be hugely grateful if you could show us around your town. *tip of the hat*

TL;DR: We're road-tripping across the USA, coast to coast. If you live in America and would simply love to show two strapping young men from the British Isles around your town, comment or inbox. Oh, and we're filming the whole thing too. Thanks!

**edit:** Whoa! We really didn't expect this much of a response to this, you guys are absolutely amazing! It looks like we've got some work to do now - we're planning on starting a blog tracking our progress as suggested by bge951. It'll also serve as a way for us to track the locations you guys have been so kindly offering to us so far, and a way for any others to be submitted. We're currently in the process of planning out a route from your suggestions, so keep 'em coming!

Well, I talked to him for a couple minutes while I waited to place my order and he seemed like a really nice guy, and I had my laptop with me at lunch so why, not, I'll go vote for him.

After I voted, I did some googling on him, and found a ton of articles about what happened to him:

[Tony Dowels' positive outlook, not his wheelchair, endears him to Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow](http://www.tampabay.com/sports/college/tony-dowels-positive-outlook-not-his-wheelchair-endears-him-to-florida/992477)

I don't know this guy, and I'll probably never see him again, but if you guys could either go vote for him, or direct me to the right subreddit to x-post this, it'd be appreciated. I think I just had a moment today where I thought ""damn, it would really suck to lose the ability to walk and live normally for the rest of my life, and this guy has and has a more positive attitude than I do.""

One year ago almost to the day I became homeless and began living out of my car. Since that time I have been working and going to school full time (with a 4.0 GPA) in San Francisco but have been unable to move out of my car because I've been paying for school and paying down debts I accumulated during the 1 year (2 years ago) that I was unemployed. 

Tonight I slid across a wet and foggy mountain road, hit a tree, teetered off a cliffside, totaled my car, and only have a small scratch on my finger to show for it - the police said I was incredibly lucky because they airlifted a crash victim one week ago on that very road. How my car didn't slide off the cliff is anyone's guess...the back wheels were inches from the drop. 
EDIT: https://picasaweb.google.com/111598471734365847508/Accident

All I have with me is my book bag with some school work, a tablet, and a change of clothes. I don't have a cell phone. The policeman dropped me off at a Starbucks in Saratoga, CA (south of San Jose near the Santa Cruz mountains). What do I do now? 

Redditors I need your help so desperately. I dont really have any friends...being homeless does that to you. As I slid across that road I didnt fight it; I was at peace and I welcomed death because the last 2 years have been the most grueling experience. Im utterly exhausted. I cant fight any longer...I need some help because I may just end it all tonight. Help me please (in tears).

Edit: starbucks has opened and the baristas are really nice. they've given me some coffee. 

Edit 2 - 2:50 PM PST: thank you guys for your words...ill respod in due time..right now need to figure some things out. i managed to hitch my way back to SF. Here I have a home base like probably being able to get into the university to clean up and what not eventhough finals are over. I need help getting my valuables which are in the trunk of my car...clothes, soap, and other essentials. The car is in a towing yard in San Jose...anyone care to help? They open monday morning. I was thinking of getting a storage unit to store my stuff once i get it from my car...anyone care to help me fund this? And i guess ill just stay on the streets for a while. I have to work tomorrow...can someone help me with a laundry fund? Thank you everyone. 

Edit3 Dec 17, 7:30pm PST : last night after my post i went to my uni only to find everything was closed. Shortly thereafter I passed out from the exhaustion because I hadn't slept since the accident. I woke up with an awful headache and in a daze - i unconsciously wandered the raining streets and heard voices. When I came to, I found myself on the other side of town. Since then I have a pain from the left side of my neck, a soreness on the left side of my body, and a pain on my right ribcage/ torso. I started slurring my speech today as well. I can't afford medical treatment right now. Redditors this may be the end of the line for me. I've done a good job of compartmentalizing my life so as to give an appearance of normalcy to the world around me but this takes the cake. It's going to take every ounce of wit and strength moving forward. I go to work tomorrow and I'll continue the charade until my body gives out on me.

Before i post my question some backgroud info: (if you just want to sign please scroll down, you have my deepest thanks)


My next door neighbour Julio Poch has always been a proud man.
He had a successful career as a examiner-pilot at Transavia (a Dutch airline company) 3 kids and was a very pleasant man to talk with.


3 years ago suddenly i got called while i was at work, it was my mom, ""Julio is arrested and its on the news!"" quickly i looked it up on the internet and i found pictures of him wearing handcuffs made somewhere in Spain.


He got arrested because he was accused of being involved with the so called ""Death Flight's"" made by the E.S.M.A. (Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada) during the war in argentina.


Me knowing the background of my neighbour i felt something was wrong, the type op planes used for those flights where cargo-planes, and i knew Julio only flew fighter jets (the only logical way to dump someone from out of those planes is to tie them under the wings, because it could only carry 2 persons).


The only ""proof"" argentina has is that Julio was on a trip to Bali where he had an dinner with some colleagues and spoke about the war.
He spoke about the war in the same way we currently talk about our beloved sports games ""We have scored"" ""we won"" ""we made it to the finals""


He spoke about the death flights: ""we trew them into the sea"" 
I do not know the entire conversation for i was not there, but i do know 1 thing: Julio Poch ha always been digusted with those death flights and he only tried to explain the ""other side"" of the story that wasnt in the news back in those days.


Because of the different nationality's of the people at that table they chose to speak english.


Everyone on that dinner was not an native english speaker, and the evening involved alot of liqueur, 2 big details wich makes it easy for anyone to be misunderstood.


because Julio knew he was innocent he volunteered freely to go to Argentina and proof his own innocents.
the first trial took about 1 year, the judges pledged there was not enough proof for Julio to be kept in prison, and after paying a bail he was not allowed to leave the country but had to wait for a second trail to come to pass, second trail never came and instead the public attorney said he had more proof of Julio being guilty. Proof witch was the exact same stack of paper he came with the first time (and didn't proof anything).


because now there was this stack of paper Julio got arrested again, and now sits already 3 years in prison without a trial.


The Dutch authorities doesn't help because of our princess's father (Mister Jorge Zorreguieta) who was a minister at the time of the war in argentina and now an refugee in the netherlands in hiding for the things Julio is now taking the blame for.


(FYI, the ""witnesses"" had by this time gave notice they ""think"" they misunderstood Julio so even the last bit of evidence is now invalid)


Since he was arrested he became a grandfather of grandchildren he has yet to meet..


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


So here is my question, we (neighbours, family and friends of Julio) have started an petition
will you please sign this petition in order to kick the Dutch politics awake and help Julio getting a fair trial.


Because at the moment we don't believe we will see our beloved neighbour ever again in real life.


The petition can be found at: http://www.petitions24.com/tegen_schending_mensenrechten_julio_poch
All background info can be found at: http://juliopoch.org


You have my sincered thanks for reading my story, please spread the word! we need alot of people in order to shake the Dutch government awake!


please help a innocent man getting a fair trial so he can go back to his family.

**Right now I'm in heart failure, and without a new heart I may not live much longer.**  Since I heard about my heart failure I've spent countless hours trying to do everything I could to save my life.  I eat right, I exercise, I take my medications like I'm supposed to, I don't drink/smoke and I save my money to pay for my very high medical bills.

I never thought I'd live this long and now that I've made it this far, I don't want to give up.  I want to give mothers and fathers hope that their children who are born with the heart disease I was, can also survive and maybe get a new heart also.  Most people like me, don't live very long.  

So please, when you help me, you may be helping others.  If I survive this, I will dedicate my life to saving children with Severe Complex Congenital Heart Disease.  I want to make sure what I've gone through doesn't happen to anyone else.

Kick in?,cyndyetler,61,11,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1cbm2a/badass_juvenile_detention_teacher_seeks_used/,"**tl;dr** first: this ass-kicking teacher at an Alabama juvenile prison (who is also a close friend of mine) won 20 copies of Fahrenheit 451 so her students can each get their own copy....but she has 28 students. Can you kick one in? Or fast food or toiletry gift certificates for kids who don't get visitors? DM me for the physical mailing address, or send virtual assistance to mercypilkington@yahoo.com.

Somebody knew what they were doing when they gave Mercy Pilkington her name. If she worked at the public school across the street in her Alabama town, she'd be pulling 12K more in salary. Instead, she chooses to teach in the juvenile prison. Adjudicated kids--especially those in the deep South--need adults around who deeply care for them, and nobody cares for them like Mercy does.

Let me tell you something about Mercy: she's a human freak show. Her generosity, her humility, her drive to help others, her apparent lack of need for sleep--she makes no sense. And I'm not the only one who thinks so. The National Juvenile Detention Association saw fit to award her Teacher of the Year in 2010; her work has been covered online [here](http://jjie.org/healing-words-creative-writing-programs-as-therapy-for-kids-detention/99293) and [here](http://ec.libsyn.com/p/0/5/d/05de315691e24d2a/Substance_Abuse_411-55-Creative_Writing_Program_as_Therapy_for_Kids_in_Detention-Mercy_Pilkington.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d01ce823fd7cf5923b6&amp;c_id=5288921). 

For the second year in a row, Mercy has won the World Book Night competition, which enables her to give 20 of her students a copy their very own book (which is a big deal, when you're a kid in prison in Alabama. Trust me.) The book this year will be Fahrenheit 451, a reddit fave! Here's the problem: while Mercy gets 20 books, she has 28 students. She would love donations of copies, new or used. The kids would love if you'd put a personal note in the inside cover! 

If you're feeling creatively generous, there are other items that would grease the rusty spots in these kids' lives:

--Some kids don't have visits from family due to court order, family abuse, or distance. Not only are those kids, some of whom are as young as six, stuck in their cell while the other kids get visitation, but they also miss out on the perks that family visitors can provide: fast food treats and toiletries that aren't gross prison-issued. If you'd like to REALLY make a sad kid's day, you can send a gift certificate for one of the fast food joints near the prison, and Mercy would pick up the grub, or same process for drugstore goods. 

You can send a virtual gift card (to mercypilkington@yahoo.com) from these spots:  [Subway](https://www.vcdelivery.com/Cert/T2/cert_MyCertificate.aspx?sample=true&amp;GSID=oXkPWE5GgLpEYvF9S%2BNH5g%3D%3D), [Papa Johns](http://www.papajohns.com/papacard/purchase.shtm), [Arby's](http://www.arbys.com/gift-cards.html). For McDonalds--MickyD's weirdly doesn't offer virtual gift cards, so DM me for the mailing address. 

Toiletries: DM me for the mailing address to send the following: Toothpaste: any kind; soaps/shampoos: both the bottle and the product have to be clear. They can be colored, but they have to be clear. 

Or send a virtual gift card (to mercypilkington@yahoo.com) for one of these drug stores: [Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/cp/Walmart-eGift-Cards/175427) or [CVS](https://cvs.cashstar.com/gift-card/buy/?ref=cvs1). [Dollar Tree](http://www.dollartree.com/custserv/custserv.jsp?pageName=GiftCards) will mail a physical gift card for free; DM me for mailing address. 

--Copies of any new young adult books--good ideas include Bluford High books, Walter Dean Myers books, Ellen Hopkins books, Divergent, Insurgent, Vampire Academy...or maybe MY young adult book, which is a memoir about my own teenage incarceration, [Straightling](http://www.amazon.com/Straightling-Memoir-Cyndy-Drew-Etler/dp/146990280X)! (Shameless, right? And maybe cancel that idea--freak Mercy, I called her up just now to make sure I had the right drug stores...and instead of letting me ask about her students--not even about HER, mind you, but about her students--she turns the conversation around to ask how my book stuff is going. Have Mercy!) 

--Or let the kids choose with [Amazon giftcards](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-com-Gift-Card-Thank-design/dp/BT00CTP6GS) (which can be emailed directly to Mercy: mercypilkington@yahoo.com)

--Remember how I said some of the kids in the prison are six years old? Yeah. Mercy said she'd love to receive crayons and coloring books, as well. 

And finally, a great gift you can give that won't cost a cent: read and leave comments on the kids' writing on their blog, [Writers On the Inside](http://writersontheinside.com/). Mercy's told me every time her computer pings, telling them there's a new comment, the kids get all cheery and hopeful. 

Thank you, /r/assistance. I can't believe there are people like you. I really can't.

Love, Cyndy Drew Etler

Studying here has always been my dream and worked hard to achieve it. Higher education is free in Europe - however, you must provide for your own living. And I cannot.

I get no money from my parents. My family is largely dysfunctional to say at least and I don't want to get into details over the internet. Job is not an option as I am in one of the best academies in country and stay there from eight till six o'clock and have loads of work after. I cannot ask anyone anymore - every single of my friends already borrowed me money. Student loans require you to start paying the month you take the loan, unlike in America. I have tried really just about anything. The only things left for me is to sue my parents, but until the court verdict I will be homeless. Besides, suing my parents?

I currently rent an eight square meters (about 12x6 feet) room for 50$ weekly and food and study materials (paper, books, paints etc.) cost me about half this sum weekly. Not counting soap, clothes for incoming winter and so forth. I live eating groat and cheap coffee to keep me up. Sometimes my roommate shares some food with me. Every weekend my girlfriend brings me some meat to cook. That's all.

My situation is desperate. Either I will seek a job and lose my hard-earned place in the university or... well, I can't think of anything. If you, the redditors would be so wonderful to help me out, I'd be in your debt forever. Ask me for any proof of the truth of my words, I can provide it.

1346952332.0,52,self.Assistance,zgiat,Family really needs help getting a handicap van for severely disabled 9 year old and his single mom who is breaking her back dedicating 100% of her time and care to him. Please read..,ldmeow,60,8,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/zgiat/family_really_needs_help_getting_a_handicap_van/,"http://www.giveforward.com/austinsvanfund 

My brother's girlfriend has a son who was born with a chromosome disorder called MECP2 Duplication Syndrome, which has caused severe intellectual disability, delayed development/motor skills, and severe seizures, among other health problems that I don't know the extent of. He is 100% tube fed due to these health issues, and unable to walk or talk. His mother dedicates all her time to his care, since it is a full time job, and thanks to her determination and care he has just turned 9. But this means he is getting to be bigger and bigger, even with delayed development. He is 60 or so pounds, and due to the inability to walk, needs to be carried everywhere. While he has a stroller chair she can push him in, it is too big to fit in the bathroom, and can't be wheeled into a normal car.  Thus she must carry him a good portion of the time. This has started to take a huge toll on her back, and she won't be able to continue carrying him much longer. 

Very early on, the father, her ex-husband, decided he just didn't want to deal with being a dad to a ""handicap kid"" and is not in their lives anymore. (Sadly she isn't able to afford to take him to court for child support.) So she's been raising him on her own for several years now. She is unable to have a job as his needs demand total care and is modest in the amount she will(and/or is able to) accept for help, so she is not in the position to purchase a new vehicle on her own.

My brother came into her life (actually re-entered, they had dated previously early on in high school) and has stepped up as a man, showing absolute love and support for her and her son. While he has been a tremendous amount of help for her, and has even recently moved in with them after being together almost two years, he does have to work (for very low wage) full time, so they are still unable to afford this on their own. 

As briefly mentioned, the mother is very modest and humble (read: proud) as too many who truly need help are, but she has put that aside as she finally realized that she can't continue much longer without a handicap van, so they have set up a fundraiser website to try to raise funds to at least help with buying one. 

I have seen Reddit be amazing and turn up in numbers, so I have come to you to ask for help for them. Their goal is $20,000.00 but are expecting much less, hoping really for just enough to potentially turn an old van into a handicap one. However, it would be amazing if they could reach, or surpass, their goal to really get other things they desperately need as well. If you are able and can find it in your heart to make a donation, go to http://www.giveforward.com/austinsvanfund and help. Any amount helps, and if you can't make a donation, helping spread word for this cause would be greatly appreciated. If that's not possible either, your well wishes/good vibrations/prayers/thoughts/whatever would be something they will appreciate just as much. Thank you either way.

A little dog. Some big wolves. The vet and a conservation officer both state that the dog’s wound pattern is consistent with  wolf attack.
He was sliced open from belly-button to anus. Leg tendon destroyed, penis chewed to hamburger (urethra intact), and he is short one tail.
He faces amputation of a limb,  infection and long term healing. 
How he lived, no one knows, but it is a big fight now, and, of course, a costly one. $3000 and counting. The pup is on a morphine drip, and is in worse shape than initially understood..had everyone been aware of the entirety of the situation, different choices might have been made but, here he is. He survived the attack. He survived the surgeries. As my friend said, to stop fighting now because of lack of funding is unthinkable.
Of course my friend, with a small child and a limited income, is overwhelmed by this emergency, financially and emotionally.
So, this appeal. If some kind redditors, just a few of you, were able to pony up a contribution towards Nako’s care, it would be a huge relief to this family whose dog dragged himself home half-chewed.

There is also a link to the fundraising we did (still accepting donations I think) for the Down Syndrome Buddy Walk. Oliver was diagnosed in April. We thought about putting up a medical donation page to help with out of pocket expenses but that has been pretty good as we do have insurance (however, as a family we've probably spent about 1500 on co-pays and meds this year alone because we had another baby, and that baby ended up having surgery at 6 weeks for pyloric stenosis, and our premiums starting in January are going up to 700$ a month with me having to quit my job and switch us over to our husbands plan). I don't think we can complain about premiums ever considering he will probably reach the 1mil mark (he also had open heart surgery at 4 months old). So I thought I would post his wish list if anything people can get him an xmas present. Reddit schwag would be cool too (message me for a shipping address).. he wears a 4T but 5T would probably be better as some things run small?. (the little 4 month old is passing up the 6 month and 9 month clothes incase you wanted to include him).

I can tell you right now off that wish list if he were to get something is that catbus since he has been watching the movie related to this stuffed animal daily (he got the movie for his bday).

So there you have it reddit. We will be just fine, but if anyone felt in a giving mood for the season to someone specific, here you go. This kid is awesome. He hasn't been able to go back to school since the diagnosis (we are hoping in February he can start, but with all the unknowns its always going to be up in the air until he is fully done with his chemo treatments.. which will continue until the summer of 2013). When his counts are low he gets cabin fever because we can't play with friends or at the playground. He doesn't understand most of this cancer thing either, just that he has this broviac line in his chest that he gets medicine for.

Thanks for listening reddit.

**UPDATE #6** [More updates will be here](http://bit.ly/MBobiZ)

**Here is his story...**

***

Hello, reddit. Thank you for reading this. It’s a long story, I know, but there are so many twists, I couldn’t make it shorter. And speaking of twists, I’m going to start at the mid-point.

It’s a cloudy night, early November. Unseasonably warm. I’m eighteen years old, and scared, elated, excited, a little guilty. I’m standing in a highway rest stop in rural New Hampshire as the sun sets in a gray sky. I’m standing next to a man I’ve grown close to, a man who represents what I’ve been fighting for fifteen months. We’re looking for the white car.

This car isn’t just some white car. This car is my salvation. As I search the lot for a Massachusetts plate, the man says, “Y’know, Jimmy, this doesn’t have to happen. We can still go back. I know how you feel about Shortridge, but we don’t abuse kids. You know that.”

“No,” I tell him. “I’m leaving.”

No one in the real world calls me Jimmy. It was always James, back when things were real. Back when all I worried about was my brother’s growing drug problem, my grades, and how I could not get into a fight with my parents that night. I thought all that sucked. Looking back I realize I didn’t know what suck was. I didn’t know until I began my “therapeutic journey.”

I should’ve ran two years ago, sent away. I’m no better now than I was then: homeless, with $10 in my pocket and some clothes in a bin.

He asks me, since he owes me a dinner, where I want to go. I tell him I don’t know. I haven’t been to a restaurant in a while. I haven’t been anywhere in a while. So we go to Uno’s, talk about anything besides what we’re doing. When we get back to the rest stop, the white car’s still not there.


                                       So we wait.
                                               And wait.
                                                       And wait.

A long time later, a phone call. Not on my phone; the last time I touched a cell phone was over a year ago. The man answers his phone, says hello, then hands it to me. It’s my best friend. I haven’t seen him in over a year and a half.

Are you okay? he asks. Do you trust this man? he asks. Where are you? he asks. I tell him where we are. I tell him what the car looks like. I tell him I’ll see him soon.

I don’t tell him how it feels to be free. I don’t tell him I don’t know if I’m safe--that I half-trust the man, but I don’t trust his bosses. I don’t tell him how it feels to know homelessness is better than this nightmare. I don’t tell him anything, because I’m scared. Scared of where I’ve been for the past fifteen months.

He knows almost nothing about my situation, but he’s driving eight hours to come get me.

The man tries again: “Jimmy, just call him and say you changed your mind. He’ll understand. I know what it’s like to be homeless. You don’t want this.”

I ignore him. I don’t want to be homeless, but I don’t have other options. I don’t want to hear about what I’m walking into. If I do, I might agree with him. I might head back for another eight months of hell.

As the sun passes below the horizon, the car shows up. I recognize my friend before he sees me. I’m standing with a blue box with a stranger’s name on it, wearing clothes that fit me two years ago. Everything I own is in that box. Once again, I realize that I won. Once again, I realize that I’m fucked. I note the paradox as my best friend drive up.

After all this time, he looks the same. But I don’t. I’ve gained some weight, grown taller. Longer hair. New glasses. Hopefully, less acne. No wonder he didn’t recognize me at first.

And over that echo of eighteen months ago, I hear the first words from him, this friend who’s become a brother to me, in 18 months: “Hey.”

“Hey,” I tell him.

The man approaches and introduces himself. My friend looks at him, says hello, and asks me where I want to put my stuff. I put it in the back seat.

The man tries one last time: “Jimmy, come on. This is stupid.”

“No, I tell him. “This is it.”

“Well, I wish you the best of luck. You can always come back, if it doesn’t work out.”

“You should know me by now. I don’t plan on it. I won’t say it’s been good, but you’re one of the few good people there. Thanks for dinner.”

I get in the front seat, and my friend and I drive away.

And that is how I almost gained my freedom.

Three days later I’m sitting in a cafe, meeting with the man and one of his bosses. The boss says, “How’s the real world? Didn’t treat you the way you thought it would, did it?”

And my mother’s there, not saying a word. Her job is to drive me to the nearest homeless shelter, if the man and his boss say no. I tell him, “Yeah, it didn’t work out.” We discuss terms, the “agreements” behind my return to Shortridge Academy. We don’t discuss how I’ll explain to everyone at the school how, in three days, I went from prisoner to free man and back. And how this time, I have to be perfect. How one fuck up will put me on the streets of Portsmouth, Maine. That part doesn’t matter.

Now that I have your attention, let’s bring it back. Back to the day that I got in my car and headed to some place called Summit Achievement. At the time, I didn’t know much. I had only heard it was a two week testing place for Shortridge Academy. Within a few days, I would know more than I ever wanted to. Like the man said, Shortridge isn’t physically abusive. But you can abuse parts of a person other than their body.

I think I was sent away on August 21st, 2010. I don't exactly know. I never have visits, so time blurs together. Every day the same, you know? I was sent away for bad grades. At least, bad by my parents standards. Almost all Cs. I'd failed French (by one point!), and I took summer school for Algebra II.  I probably could have done better. I'm not going to blame my grades on ADD. I will, however, blame half of it on my parents. They weren't great parents. But still, the other half was on me. 

I was not escorted to Summit Achievement, which turned out to be a wilderness program. I had heard about these programs before and knew that if I didn't go with my parents, something worse would happen. Summit was in Stowe, Maine, and I don’t have much to say about it. It wasn't bad, and they were more ethical than other programs. I would never send a kid there, but still, it wasn't that bad. I had some fun, sometimes is sucked hiking eight miles in the rain, but I didn’t  really mind it. The problem was they had a one program fits all mentality. So it was ineffective, but not really that bad. Unfortunately, my ""therapeutic journey"" didn't end there.

1356633968.0,49,self.Assistance,15j335,"Old lady, chronic illness, ashamed and terrified, can't afford medicine any more. (GA)",tripuri,54,5,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/15j335/old_lady_chronic_illness_ashamed_and_terrified/,"I'm not asking for money. I have no way to pay it back, and this is embarrassing enough.

I've been a ""shut-in,"" living with chronic illness for 7 years now. I take a lot of medication, at least I'm supposed to.

When the insurance company (through my husband's job) doubled the premiums, and  raised the prescription co-pays from $15 to in some cases, $100, I had to begin ""adjusting"" the dosage. 

The premiums will double again in January. 

Both my illness and even the ""adjusted"" dosage of the medicines have dramatically reduced my income. 

Even before the increased premiums and co-pays, the 10-20% of additional medical expenses resulting from complications wiped out our savings. Our credit cards had long been maxxed out. ( ironically, when I called to find out if we might be eligible for a reduction in our mortgage, I was told we don't have enough credit card debt to qualify).

Any chronic illness is costly. We have nothing of value to sell. 

We're no longer able to help our families. 

That was the most horrible sentence I've ever had to type. 

My husband is the best and most noble man who ever lived.  He's already working &gt;80 hours most weeks. It's not humanly possible for him to take a part time job. We don't have the cash to pay for COBRA, so he can't even look for a better one. 

There is no pain worse than watching a loved one suffer, helpless to do anything about it.

I ""ration"" the medicine I can afford so I can keep pain off my face when he's home. There's no deceiving him about that. We've been together over 20 years. He loves me.

I have been deceiving him about the medicine situation. I tell him I got more samples than I did, that the doctor found a cheaper substitute when there isn't one.

He's sacrificed so much already, and continues to sacrifice, day after day, for me. I can't tell him it's not enough. 

The kind of work I'm able to do, and the time I'm able to do anything have been so reduced that I'm not able to earn enough to make a difference. My computer is getting older, too, and when it goes, with it will go even my illusion of usefulness.

Because of my husband's job, and having insurance, I'm not qualified for the ""patient assistance"" programs some pharma companies have.

Although his income isn't enough to pay for the medicine, it's still enough to disqualify me from receiving what indigent programs there are where we live.

This would be the case even if he divorced me. That would, of course, remove me from the insurance, but if he were still providing me with shelter and food, his income would make me ineligible for indigent care.  The state is on to that one. He would have to literally throw me in the street.  That I even know this literally makes me nauseous.

I'm still able to walk short distances, and the ""gatekeeper"" for disability for my illness is ambulatory or not.

Although I'm ancient on the internet :) in real life it will be a year and a half before I can even apply for a few hundred dollars a month from Social Security - and even longer before I'm eligible for old age medical care.

I'm terrified. Again, I'm not asking for money. 

I'm hoping there's something I haven't thought of. I know my judgment is impaired. No matter how sure I am I've explored every option, maybe there's something I overlooked, something that could help. 

I don't want shame to keep me from asking while my computer still works. If anybody's still reading, I apologize for being tldr.

**Update:** I changed my mind. I **AM** asking for money. Not for me, but for someone near you. If you're reading this, I can guarantee you that someone who touches your life is working all the hours and jobs they can, and still coming up short.

If you're lucky enough to have discretionary income, to be able to afford to treat friends to evening out, to buy a ""designer"" jacket instead of the Wal-mart clearance special, even a couple of hundred dollars a month can keep a family you know in housing, fix the old hupty a single mom needs to get to work, buy someone's way out of pain, or even some extra time with  their families.

If you're really lucky, and have a few thousand, you can give a young person the gift of a vocational course that will give them a chance to earn above minimum - even a Living Wage. You can pay for medical treatment that will extend, or even save a life.

Please, as you go about your day, look around at the faces you may not notice. The people who make your coffee, work the register where you buy things, the person who empties your office wastebasket at night, the friend or relative you know doesn't make much money, but who will literally die of shame before they ask for help.

I probably would have screwed that up if I went to NOLA or not. I don't want to be this way. I don't want to be drunk every day. I don't want to push people away because I'd rather be drunk than social. I want to be sober, productive and social.

So, I just need information. I hope y'all can help me.

I understand if you want to be helpful and suggest options, but I really truly have exhausted them all, and paying out of pocket is not an option right now.) is as follows; Adult adoption is legal in FL, and I have a very good friend who has offered to adopt me.

I just had to be admitted to the hospital after going to the emergency room with heart issues.  Luckily, things are looking alright now, but because of the whole situation I don't have enough money to make my rent payment in March.  It's $785 and I'm short about $500.  I can't find any work right now to pay it in time so I'm turning to you guys.  (I can show proof of any of this information that you need.  Bank balance, hospital papers, rental agreement, etc.)

I'm a professional artist, and will do illustrations for money.  While I am incredibly grateful for anyone who wants to donate, I don't mind doing commissions of whatever you want.  I uploaded some of my work so you can see what kind of styles I work in:

[My art album](http://imgur.com/a/9pF5M)

Here are my heavily discounted prices for anyone who would love to help out a struggling artist pay his rent.  All illustrations include one character of anything you want, your favorite comic character, movie character, cartoon character, video game character, favorite celebrity, portrait of you/your family member/your pet/your motorcycle, etc.  Just about anything you can think of.  Prices are as followed:

Black and white sketch:  $20

Color sketch:  $40

Finished black and white illustration: $75

Finished color illustration: $100.

If you want a more detailed illustration like multiple subjects/characters or detailed background/environment, please double the price for each category.  I also do logo/graphic design for anyone who needs that done for something.

If you're interested in an illustration please pm me to get my paypal information.  Once I get payment, I can usually finish your illustration the same day unless I have a large amount of people who want one done at the same time.  If that's the case I'll finish them as fast as I can without slacking on the quality.  Again, I would be incredibly grateful for anyone who just wants to donate, but I have no problem working for the money.

I really appreciate any help I can get.  I'm afraid if I don't make my rent payment my landlord will kick me out and I'll be living in my car.  I don't have any friends or family who are in a situation to take me in right now.  Please help a desperate man who is willing to work.

His boss is planning to pay for the damages, but he wants the Dad to reimburse him for half of the damages.

However, the Dad must file a complaint with the Illinois Department of Labor. Dad is now worried about retaliation if he files a complaint. Dad can still be terminated because of the accident.

I came here through [sino aupair](http://www.sinoaupair.com/en/aupair.aspx) as an ""au pair student"". They promised me many things, and lied more than a politician. Basically I came here on false pretenses, and now am stuck in a horrible situation. I hate it here, and I'm not the only one who's been screwed over. 


So here's the breakdown: 
I decided in January I wanted to take a gap year from university and be an au pair somewhere. After looking through many sites and being contacted by families from all over the world I was contacted by this agency. They told me they would place me in a family and promised me all these benefits. 


* 12 month contract: trip to china reimbursed, flight home paid for by the agency - *before arrival we agreed that I would get my money back within one month, fast forward to me asking for it, and they denied and stalled for another month until I finally forced them to pay me, they have refused other au pairs who had the same contract as me*


*  Monthly compensation of 750RMB-1200RMB or more 


* Visa Invitation, Extension Assistance, and paid for by the agency - *in reality they make you pay for it, and pay you back MAYBE a month later, and offer NO assistance what-soever*


* Arrival Orientation - *...stilll waiting on that one*


* 24/7 emergency call number -*another negative, I can't even get a hold of them in a non emergency*


* Assigned coordinator - *nope, diddly squat*


* Monthly newsletter &amp; Cultural Activities - *this is my biggest pet peeve, they advertised this and promised this multiple times before hand yet they didn't even do them before I came here, and have only done one crappily executed attempt in almost 4 months*


* International travel and health insurance - *they refused to pay for my insurance because it was too expensive, but only told me after they hadn't paid for it for a month of me being here. They had my doctor's exam months prior to me coming and knew they wouldn't be paying for it yet they still including it in the contract and let me come here uninsured, and of course by Murphy's law I did indeed get sick and need to go to the hospital*


* Chinese classes with materials - *they refused to put me in a class for a month after my arrival, then put me in a class with two new au pairs for two months then took another month and a half off. They could have gotten a private tutor for me like they did for a bunch of other au pairs. They also made a bunch of them pay for their materials even though they weren't supposed to*


The list goes on of what they lied about. They've also reneged on our contract in multiple ways. As well as breaking the International Au Pair Association code of conduct. So as you can see, they pretty much break all the rules. What I need help with is seeing if there's a charge I can bring them up on or how to launch a federal investigation. Keep in mind this is sort of an international ordeal, so it's a bit difficult to track down the proper laws and codes.


I just really want to go home, this wasn't at all what I was expecting and it's making me spiral back into my depression, which is somewhere I'd rather not go.

Those are maxed out now, so I can't even fall back on them.

I'm back to work but struggling and one of my jobs just got delayed and I can't pay my rents or my employee now who I owe something like $800 who has his own rent to pay.

However, we've been building a lot of furniture and other small products, but haven't been fully immersed in the marketing of them yet, so they aren't really selling.

But please don't start off by harassing someone if you are not sure. The last thing I want to do is make life worse for someone who truly needs help.

If there is anyone out there that has any suggestions or resources of assisting me in these types of actions, please feel free to contact me.


Please note we still offer assistance in many things like simple questions, help with homework and simple advice. There was a perfect example of what is acceptable and what is not in today's postings.  Someone was doing some marketing polling for a business. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

She works very, very hard cleaning houses and doing whatever jobs she can to provide for her young children, and because she can't afford a car, they walk everywhere and take the bus. Last week, her 11-year-old son Enoc and her were walking home from the store when Enoc found a baby bird on the side of the road. He picked it up to help it find its nest but his mom asked him to put it down while he looked for it. 

[Here's the initial news story](http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/20130525phoenix-boy-critically-injured-by-vehicle-abrk.html)

As he bent over to put the baby bird down, a man trying to move a car that had a full steering wheel/brake lock on it gunned it and lost control of the vehicle, running over Enoc before smashing through a block wall. The man exited the vehicle, briefly helped drag Enoc from under the vehicle, then ran off in fear of what he'd done. He's since turned himself in:

[The follow up story](http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/ding-mabior-turns-himself-in-after-deadly-hit-and-run)

His mother Maria is absolutely devastated and we hope others can join us in donating any funds they can afford – she needs help with the funeral expenses and some basic necessities while she's getting back on her feet. I've seen some amazing things happen on Reddit when we come together and my goal is to do everything I can to raise enough money to cover the funeral and give her some financial cushion. 

Ultimately, it would be absolutely awesome if we raise enough to buy her an inexpensive used car so this tragedy doesn't happen again, as I know she's dreading walking with her children again, constantly worrying about every passing vehicle. Of course, summer is coming and walking in the oppressive Phoenix heat is almost torture, so it would really be good for her.

She's very proud and doesn't want to hardly take any charity, but if anyone deserves a break it's her and her kids, so I don't mind doing the asking for her.

Hi, I live in Quincy, IL and I've been unemployed for several months now. Long story short, my unemployment ran out and my savings have been depleted except $20. I apply for any job available daily, and it's been unsuccessful until recently. I'm awaiting my third and final interview for a new job with a company that I feel pretty positive about. I'm hoping to be hired and have a paycheck within a few weeks. 

I'm fortunate enough to have a generous roommate who has helped with the bills while I've been unemployed. My real issue at the moment is my cat, Henry. He's six years old and I've had him since he was a baby. [Here's a photo!
](http://i.imgur.com/yvqKs.jpg)

He was diagnosed with diabetes a little over a year ago and has a prescription for insulin. The first bottle I bought him has lasted since then, but this morning I drew what I believe to be the last dose. In order to get him more, he'll need to go to a vet and have his glucose checked. The insulin usually runs around $100-130. I don't know how much the vet visit would cost around here, but I'm willing to call around and get pricing. This is a small town so that won't be difficult. I can provide photos of receipts from his previous vet visits, detailing procedures, as well as photos of his prescription. 

I know this is a long shot, but I've asked my family for help already with no success. The local humane society said they wouldn't be able to help either. This is really my last hope. I'd be willing to fully pay back whatever money is loaned once I have a couple of paychecks. I can provide any more information or cat photos you may need via PM.

Thanks for reading. 

Edit: One kind soul has donated $50 towards the cause! 

Edit 2: Another donation of $100! This is enough to cover the trip to the vet, and an appointment has been made. Anything else will be for the insulin. wiseblueberry has offered to donate some if it's still good and the right type, so hopefully no more money will be needed!

Edit 3: Another donation of $50! Thank you! [Also, some more pictures of Henry](http://imgur.com/a/xrX5t)!


Since some have asked, my PayPal address is [redacted]. Thanks again!

I called local vets to price services. The best I found for an exam and glucose test was $61.50.

He is deaf, and homeless. You can read about our adventure in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/siat1/seattle_help_hearingimpaired_homeless_man_with/) post.

I had a sweet plan all set up, and before it was executed, the city took boumboum's home and towed it to the local impound. A mere hours before he was in the clear. 

I have someone who **may** be able to reduce the fee's at impound, and I have another who **may** be able to tow it out of there. What I need is help if these things do not happen.

Firstly, I need money. I am just going to assume that we will have to pay the whole impound fee, which is $180 + $36 right now. Obviously it goes up everyday for storage fees.

I need a local with access to a tow truck. Or someone who is willing to use their AAA tow on a stranger. Or I need enough $ to pay for a tow out of pocket.

I need a place boumboum can tow his RV to, where it will be safe until around May 6th, when he can make the necessary repairs to it. If anyone knows of a parking lot, piece of land, backyard, anything where it will be safe, that would be great. The closer to Aurora the better. 

Ideas, suggestions, anything, I will take it. Please help me help my new friend. He's an awesome person who's having a tough go of it right now. He just want's his home back. 

Feel free to ask me anything. **I am willing to pay back anyone who donates out of my pocket. I am a mother of 2, and not well off myself, so it will take me a while. I would have to pay back a little at a time.** I will be buying a prepaid credit card to take donations, to avoid paypal fees. 

EDIT: I am not in Seattle. I am 2500 miles away, or I would do most of this myself :)

TL;DR: need help getting my homeless, deaf, friends home back. 

**UPDATE: I found a very nice man in Seattle who will tow the RV from the impound lot, to destination unknown (as of now) for FREE!!!!**

**UPDATE NO 2**: I have calls into the towing company president, who is 'seeing what I can do' about the impound fees. I don't want to take any donations or anyones money until I know EXACTLY how much I will need, AND we have a location to tow it to.  I also have calls into several churches to see about towing it there. Thank you all for your kind words, upvotes, and prayers.

I love her so much. Our parents started dating when I was 10, so I have known her for more of my life than not. (I am 22.)

She was only 26, My family is a mess.

I remember listening to awful 90's rock in her room everyday after school. I remember helping her sneak out at night as teenagers. We were both the oldest member of or families so we instantly bonded.


She was beautiful as was her son, Who was only 5 years old. Evan is the biggest ball of energy I have ever seen. He does not really understand what is going on or why everyone is so sad. I am heartbroken he will grow up without his mommy.


My family is not rich, My dad is retired army, currently works help desk. My step mom is a physical therapist for a nursing home.

The funeral is on monday, I am broke. I need to be there, I do not want to ask my parents for help as they are already strained with funeral expenses.

I need about 200 in gas to make the round trip, ANYTHING over that will go to my parents to cover funeral expenses. and anything over that will go into a trust fund my parents are setting up for Evan.


This would mean the world to me. Thank you so much

I was recommended to post over here from /r/helpit

I didn't realise there was a network of subreddits for helping those who need it but I would like to offer what I can. I have:

- internet access
- a Paypal account
- around $60 to spare

I am not a well-off man. I work an 8hr/day office job which doesn't pay enough for me to save much after covering my bills. I'm a graduate with $40,000 debt. I live in another country to friends and family and often can't afford airfare back home to see them. I also have a lifelong love for video games (I work in the industry) and would dearly like to go buy Skyrim.

**But**, I know people have it worse off than me and I know that while I can still put food on the table, relatively speaking, I have excess wealth. I'd like to spread a bit of that around.

Please tell me, how can I put this to good use? Can I help **you**? Or is there some good cause you would point me towards? I have already donated to some charities but I would welcome some further suggestions. I promise to do all in my power to help as far as I can make my resources stretch.

I have listened to your suggestions and input and have come up with a more civil and consistent way to help and be helped. Please read them and tell me if there are any issues I have left out. Of course I welcome your input.

Rollout is working on a verification application. I look forward to it with great anticipation.  We still need graphics to use for the different icons that will be used in the system. (ex: request, giving, received and others you may think of) We also are taking suggestions and asking for help designing a large banner to go at the top of the page. We really need you graphic artist to step up.

Anyway, without any further delay here are the new guidelines. After you have a chance to comment we will make any adjustments and then post a link to them at the top of the submission box.

---------------


**MAKING A REQUEST:**


* Anyone is allowed to make a request but take note you will be asked to verify your situation. **DO NOT TAKE IT PERSONALLY.** It is necessary to prevent people attempting to work the system from  taking advantage of our good nature.
* We recommend you use your primary account but understand if you choose not to. A new account will look more suspicious so you might be asked to provide more proof. If using a throwaway account you might considered offering to supply your real account to a person considering helping by PM. That is a fair request.
* Proof that you do not want to post in public can be offered by PM. Please have it available to offer the folks that might request it. I’m sorry that we have to ask in your time of need but it is a necessary step.
* If you make arrangements with someone that involves returning any items, services or money, please be specific on those arrangements.** Do not make promises you can not keep.** If for some reason you can’t fulfill that obligation at the required time, contact the person who helped to explain why. If you said you will pay it in back in two weeks and something comes up where you can’t, please just simply let the person know when you will be able to take care of it. We keep track of these transactions so do not violate that trust. A second chance will not be offered.

* Include your city and state or country and province in the post. It makes it easier to find help more specific to your local.

* We offer all kinds of help here but prefer to assist in more direct ways. For example if you are in need of food someone might offer to buy groceries or supply extra food they already have. To simply post a need then be insistent on only taking money is not acceptable. Folks here are very innovative when it comes to solving problems. If you came here just wanting money you have come to the wrong place.

* If someone helps you out, please update your post to show that the request has been filled. In fact also make a post thanking them for their kind efforts. 

-------------------

** CONSIDERING A REQUEST**

If you see a post that you are considering fulfilling first take some precautionary steps.

* Check the person’s overview page and use it to determine if they are worthy of your help

* Time as a redditor is one method but doesn’t always work. People are sometimes embarrassed to ask with their primary account. I’ve considered not allowing requests with a throwaway account but decided against it. If they are doing this they should be willing to give their username of their primary account by PM. Even if they are new to reddit they should be allowed to make a request but should expect more scrutiny because of it.

* You may ask the person in the comment thread or by PM to supply information to back their claims. But **PLEASE DO THIS IN A CIVILIZED MANNER.** True there are some who might try to take advantage but let us not punish the genuine folks for their transgressions. It is horrible when you are on your last leg and resort to asking for help and get berated.  We can accomplish verification without tearing down the spirit of folks truly in need. There will be no more infighting allowed.
* If you suspect someone of being dishonest and trying to scam the system, contact the mods immediately. We do our best to keep the integrity of this reddit and investigate all such reports. **Do not get into a battle with a person you suspect.** Message the mods with all the information you have and the reason you suspect any fraud and I promise we will look into it and take any necessary action.
* The first rule of giving here is to **NEVER** give something you can’t afford to lose. There might be a chance someone does not live up to their promises. Never put yourself in a position where if that happens you yourself will be put in jeopardy.

-------

* **Before you give any help or assistance gather the private information you would need if a problem should arise. It will be too late to do that afterwards.**

-----------------

* If you make a deal for help that is to be paid back, take note of that obligation and make arrangements **in advance** that allows you to pursue this person if the obligation is not met.
* If you do loan someone money, I would like to be notified once the obligation has been paid back. That way I can keep track of the reliable folks who do fulfill their promises. If they don’t pay you back as promised I would like to know as well so I can keep track of that too. You take the responsibility of pursuing that person if they do not pay you back. However I will assist if I can.

-------------------


**OFFERING HELP**

* Once you have decided to assist someone please make sure you have verified them to your satisfaction.
* Consider more innovative and direct ways of supplying help. Just sending money may be easier but it increases the chance for abuse. If someone wants help to pay their gas bill considering paying that bill yourself directly. Gifts cards to a specific outlet, buying the items yourself, giving items you already have, directing people to agencies that can assist and good old fashion advice is always the preferred method. The “wish list” has been suggested buy I think that only serves to be too specific and limits the ability of the giver. I do not recommend this method.
* If you decide to give money directly to the person please verify them before you do. Assume in your mind the worst possible scenario and decide what information you would like to have should it occur. Then gather that information beforehand.
* If you make arrangements for a loan make the terms specific to both yourself and to person you help. Please let me know about these transactions once they have been fulfilled or broken. I like to keep track of them so we know who is worthy of our help. 

-----------------

*Within minutes of posting these guidelines one of our subscribers put them into action. It was done flawlessly. Please check this example and how it was handled. No back and forth fighting, quick and efficient, and action was taken immediately resulting in a removal of the post and the banning of the user. Actually I left the post up as an example. Stellar Job on this one. It's the perfect example:*

--------------------


**LET’S REMEMBER WHY WE ARE HERE**

Reddit is more than a place of  rabble and making poop jokes. We actually make a difference. We are proud of this community and the things we do. The generosity here has astounded me. Yes we are nice…, but we aren’t stupid either. Don’t let your emotions get the best of you and allow people to take advantage of our kindness and concern for the welfare of others. Take the proper steps as listed above so we can continue our great work.

* **If you are unsure of these guidelines you of course can contact me or any of the other mods.** 

We  take this reddit seriously and work to keep its integrity. Should you have questions or suspicions and are not sure how to proceed, contact us so we can work through it properly.

* **We will not tolerate any more cat fights. We can be smart but we can also be civil.**

* **And please stop the downvoting unless absolutely necessary.** - It serves no purpose.

-----------------------


**Thank you all for everything you do.**

I count literally every penny for bills. I have 2 dollars in pennies and 1 single to pay for laundry, which I'm honestly lucky to have right now. We are late on rent, and that's never happened before. My boyfriend and I are rationing groceries to last until food stamps come in. My dogs eat great, but we do not. I often skip meals and don't tell others, so we have dinners or so he can eat because he gets sicker than I do if he skips eating. 

We are an extremely frugal couple. I work part time and coordinate my schedule to best fit my boyfriend's 9-5 schedule to save on gas (which often means waiting around for hours to start work or after work) I have a coupon for nearly everything, and also buy on sale/clearance. We shop thrift stores for sheets, towels, jackets. We scrimp on electricity use, only have Hulu Plus, and are in income based housing. We sell our furniture periodically and don't have much to our place. We have 1 car. Yet, we are so broke that this week I volunteered to fast to save our groceries until our food stamps are available in 2 weeks. I have barely enough to cover gas, and nothing else. My boyfriend has $3 to his name until his bimonthly check gets deposited. This is so painful and we are extremely depressed. I want to kill myself. I was previously unemployed for a year due to this horrible area where nepotism takes precedence over experience. I finally found a part time job in a big store, where they never have full time available. I'm still applying everywhere, but to no avail because someone in power knows someone. We are barely hand to mouth, and just the tiniest slip up has us unable to eat just to keep our apartment and car. I'm so miserable and hungry.

She absolutely must have it in her arms in order to fall asleep, and cries when it goes in the wash. Problem is, it's falling apart. I've Googled every possible search term I could think of, but without tags to identify a manufacturer I haven't been able to find a replacement. 

It is a pink cat that stands up straight instead of having 'sitting' back legs. It seems to be made of high pile acrylic plush fabric. It has large embroidered blue eyes with 3 lashes, and two 'glare spots' embroidered into each eye. It's nose is a embroidered heart shape in dark pink and connects to similarly embroidered mouth. It has 4 black plastic string-like whiskers on each check. It's entire muzzle is the same light pink as it's belly and paws; the rest of the cat is a darker pink. It's triangular ears have a softer low pile plush inserts in the same dark pink color as it's mouth/nose. Each back paw has low pile dark pink plush inserts and each pad is embroidered around the outside. It's front paws are light pink with two sewn lines (making it a 3 'fingered' paw). The sides of it's head and it's tail have dark pink embroidered stripes.

No one in the family can remember where this thing came from, so I haven't had any luck tracking down a seller. I would be SO grateful for any assistance you can provide. I'm dreading the day the poor thing falls to pieces and I have to tell my daughter that her favorite lovey went to Stuffed Animal Heaven.

On August 9th I'm going to be going to Lucile Packard to talk to their pediatric heart transplant team about my heart transplant.  Today is my birthday, and may be my last.  I need your help, to make sure this doesn't come true.

**Right now I'm in heart failure, and without a new heart I may not live much longer.**  Since I heard about my heart failure I've spent countless hours trying to do everything I could to save my life.  I eat right, I exercise, I take my medications like I'm supposed to, I don't drink/smoke and I save my money to pay for my very high medical bills.

I never thought I'd live this long and now that I've made it this far, I don't want to give up.  I want to give mothers and fathers hope that their children who are born with the heart disease I was, can also survive and maybe get a new heart also.  Most people like me, don't live very long.  

So please, when you help me, you may be helping others.  If I survive this, I will dedicate my life to saving children with Severe Complex Congenital Heart Disease.  I want to make sure what I've gone through doesn't happen to anyone else.

As we were leaving my friend and I stopped and chatted with another guy who had a younger black German Sheppard. While we were talking with our dogs by our side the German Shepard growled and then pounced on my dog sending him to the ground. We quickly broke it up and when my dog Enzo got up he was shooting blood out of a one inch hole in the side of his chest. All i could think of was getting him to the animal hospital, and i didnt get any contact info from the other dogs owner (who is responsible for his dog under city law). To pay these vet bills I have maxed out my credit card and dipped into money set aside to make mortgage. I was only able to buy one week of medications when i need more than a months worth and follow up x-rays and fluid removal. If everyone who read this could spare one dollar I could help keep this dog in comfort to a PROPER recovery. I guess I should add a few things. I need to get Rymadol, Tramadol, Clavamox and Baytril (the expensive one) which is about $130 a week. I have spent about $1500 so far and the follow up visit to the vet is estimated around $600 with x-rays and if they have to remove fluid in the chest cavity. I can post pics of current payments if required.
Think about it, one dollar is less than a 20 oz soda. Its a snack out of a vending machine. A penny, a quarter anything that can get me closer to helping my best friend.  If you dont have money you can help me with sharing this link. Thanks for listening guys.

Thankfully everyone is alive and well, although the daughter was treated in Galveston for burns. Unfortunately, the family had no insurance for their home. This page is dedicated to helping raise donations in the form of labor, material, and money to rebuild this family's home. Furnishing has already been donated. We are trying to build a house.

This is what happened in the mother's own words: 
On December 21st my family had a ""Doomsday"" of our own. We lost our home and everything we owned in a house fire. It was near 3:00 AM when my husband was woken by screams of terror from our 13 year old daughter. He woke me as he jumped from the bed saying that something is wrong. We headed for our bedroom door; as he opened it, flames and smoke rolled toward us. There was no way of getting to our daughter, even though her room was just inches from ours. My husband and I were able to escape through our bedroom window, thanks to his quick thinking. He had to first move a huge mirrored dresser that was blocking our exit. We were both getting weak from the smoke, so he had to dive head first through the glass to the ground. He grabbed me by my arms just as I was about to fall back and pulled me out of the window. Before I had even hit the ground, he was already headed around the corner of the house to our daughter's window. Her window had an A/C unit that was in the way. He was trying to get it out of the way and had to beat it until it broke loose and pushed it inside. He jumped up through the window; as he screamed her name, she flew into his arms and they both fell to the ground outside. We also had some friends staying in a back room. He was able to pull them out to safety. Both of them had already passed out from the smoke. Our three dogs Betsy, Winnie, and Beanie Winnie were trapped and did not make it out of the house. I thank the Lord above for giving my husband the strength and the will to save all of our lives with his quick actions. The whole house was engulfed in fire. As we stood outside, I could see he had gotten us out just in time. All five of us were transported by ambulance to the hospital. Everyone had inhaled so much smoke that it was hard to even breathe. My daughter suffered burns to her face, right arm, and her hand. Her lungs were also badly damaged from smoke inhalation. The doctors in the Beaumont ER had to put a tube down her throat to keep her breathing. She was then transported by helicopter to Shiners Hospital in Galveston, where she was in ICU for about a week due to the damage to her lungs. Thankfully, the burns to her face will heal in time and should not scar, the doctors said. I want you to know that my daughter is the strongest person I know and refuses to physically let this hold her down. The hardest part for her seems to be the emotional side of everything. Please pray for our family in this time of

I want to first say that I am not looking for money, not that I have a lot, but I need some help with planning this thing.

Here's the backstory, 3 years ago I met my fiancee working at Nordstrom in California, she was my boss and was let go from her position as a result of this. It was devastating at the time but little did we know how good everything would turn out. 

As you can imagine I was pissed at the company so I quit as well. She found a job up in Portland, Oregon where she grew up so I decided to move up here with her. Everything is going great we got engaged in July and she loves her Job and I'm going to school to be a paramedic which I love too. Now about a year ago her father (which I have come to look to as a second father) was diagnosed with non small cell lung cancer in the left lower lobe. It was removed and he did a round of chemo, the doctors said everything was good and that he was cancer free.

Than about a week ago he developed a headache and out of nowhere he lost his voice completely. It was so weird, so he went to the doctor to run some tests. It was literally the worst news we could imagine. They told him that he has a few months to live and at this point there is no treatment it is simply about making sure that he has a good quality of life. It is was crazy... 

So after this news I talked o my fiancee and agreed that instead of doing the wedding in August like we had originally planned, we are going to move it up to January 13th. We decided that we are going to make it super low key and make sure that her dad could still walk her down the aisle. I can't tell you guys how stressful this is being new to the area and literally having to do all of this in less than 30 days. So I am asking for some help in the way of information.



We decided on a venue, it is a rental house that we are just going to rent for like 2 days and do the wedding inside since it will probably be raining.  We have about 35 people we plan on having to the wedding. The main things I am having trouble with is the following. Please keep in mind, we have a pretty small budget for this thing since we have had hardly anytime to save at all.





*We would really like a photographer for the wedding, if anyone knows someone who could do like 3-4 hours of pictures with all the booze they want after for less than $500?





*Anyone know a good caterer in the cannon beach area reasonably priced?





*Also need a good florist in either the Portland or coast area? I would also be open to ideas on this?




*Also any aspiring musicians want to make like a couple hundred for laying some guitar or piano?




All this plus I'm sure there's more...




Thanks everyone so much...

That thread is here:

Now, with the news, we are faced with looming care costs for hospice and medical/funeral expenses. I've only got a couple hundred bucks to my name and my insurance will only pay so much for these services. 

We have no life insurance due to her long standing medical condition and paying for things like a funeral will be challenging at best. 

Please help me, reddit. She means so much to me and all I want is for her last few days to be as dignified and special as possible.

She was a single mom to four children. 

Three of her four kids were at home at the time and they all escaped. The oldest boy was burned severely after repeatedly attempting to go back in the house to get his mother out. He was just released from the hospital this week. 

The cause of the fire has been determined to be an electrical problem with the house's wiring. They lived in an older mobile home that had been added on to and the addition was apparently not wired correctly. 

The children have gone to live with their father who lives about 2 hours away. They have lost their mother, their home, all of their belongings, their friends and even their pets. (Note: the 3 dogs escaped harm but couldn't go with them to their dad's. Neighbors are caring for them.)

They held funeral services for her on Tuesday of this week. There is a balance owed to the funeral home. I am asking for your assistance with paying this balance in full. She did not leave any life insurance behind and her family is very poor. 

I will be happy to PM links to any proof of this story. I don't want to violate any privacy rules by posting her obituary or the news story.

We all currently live in Bolivia, but my brother in law is an Alaskan fisherman so he has all the things necessary to receive the donations. Luckily, here in Bolivia it's easy to find an organ donor, so all we need in the money to pay for the doctors services and the hospital.

Any donation you can give will be very much appreciated and will go towards keeping this loving woman alive and well. 

I've been a member here for 4 years and counting and have participated in this community so I know what Reddit is capable of. I've seen you guys perform miracles and change peoples lives. Poor kids have had Christmases, a family of 4 had help for food money, and much much more.

Help?,IGottaSnake,52,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ht75u/totaled_my_car_4_days_before_i_am_supposed_to_get/,"**I have my goal and what should be enough for the down payment on the truck!!**
**I cannot thank everyone enough for the help and I promise to have it all back to each one of you the day I get that financial aid. It means so much to me, and I know my son is going to think the people who helped his mommy get our new truck are just the best people ever. :)**

**Will update with pics ASAP**

Hi there. I don't really know anywhere else to turn. I need **short term** help. I always keep a buffer in the account in case of emergencies, but this time the timing was as bad as it could get. If the wreck happened a month before or after, I would have been fine to just go get a car...but it happened right after I paid tuition for summer semester (I am trying to complete 2 bachelors degrees and summers are not optional for me), days after I paid for books, and just 4 days before I am supposed to drive to FL to get my son for the summer.

I rear-ended someone due to fault of both of us. She had no taillights and did not have her blinker on so I had no signs she was going to slow down or stop and therefore had no idea looking to the left for a second would cause such a shitty turn of events. I was not tailgating, but with no sign of her slowing before I glanced to see if the place I was going was close, I came up on her pretty quickly when she stopped suddenly to make her turn. Of course, by the time I looked back and realized her car was way too close, all the slamming on the brakes I could do couldn't stop my poor little car from going right under her SUVs bumper. Everyone was fine, but my car is done for. It was insured, but it is 11 years old and had 250k miles on it, so there is nothing coming to me int he way of cash towards another car. The cops cited me despite me watching them test her taillights and seeing that they were out...but that is another issue that I will deal with in court.

Right now, my problem is just trying to get into a vehicle in the next 2 days. I *just* paid off thousands of bills on my credit from my exhusband that he ran up when we were married and he picked up his drug habit (he no longer does drugs, but I am still paying for it). It left me hurting, but ok. However, the credit hasn't caught up with the paid off debts. I did find someone willing to finance a low priced truck for me, but I need help with the down payment. I have a couple hundred, but I need a couple more. 

I don't want a hand out or a gift. Don't tell me that is what it is because I will pay you back anyway. I am not poor enough to deserve or need gifts...I just need a short term loan. My financial aid comes in July 15th, which will pay me back for everything I just had to pay. I can pay back any funds then, plus some if you would like. 

I just want to go get my kid and enjoy the first full summer we have been able to have since he was a toddler. I am wiling to offer whatever proof I can, just name it. It is usually me helping people out, so it is pretty desperate times if I am asking for the help. Once, I had a redditor offer a gift of cash when I mentioned an airline messing up my christmas flights, and I paid him back. The only other time I have asked for anything here, it was to donate to a charity I was walking for.

If anyone can help out just until July 15th, you would be my angel! Please make sure I have enough info to be able to pay you back, even if it is just $5!!!!

EDIT: [Claim](http://img638.imageshack.us/img638/9933/insurancess.jpg) This came out smaller than I thought it would, but I think you can make out the name, date, etc. If anyone wants me to redo it bigger, I will.

[Skype with my boss](http://img850.imageshack.us/img850/3606/skypess.jpg) It is a pretty laid back atmosphere, hence the boss's reaction to my wreck being ""shit"". :) I also want to note that I told her I could not get financed, but that was before the dealer called me back about an hour after that and told me if I could get a decent down payment, that he could make it work.

I am open to proving that I am using funds on the truck in any way someone can suggest I do so!

**EDIT 2:** THANK YOU to the redditor who threw in $50!! He didn't give me his reddit name so I don't want to call him out with his real name, but you know who you are...and thank you. I can't even put into words how much the help is appreciated!

**Edit 3:** Thank you to the Greg(g)s of Reddit! Another $50 in the pot!

$100 to go and we are set to roll. I could pee myself right now. I had pretty much given up hope yesterday that I would be able to pull it together. In the big scheme of things, the truck will be much more comfortable for our trip than the Tuarus would have been anyway... not that saying goodbye to that car after 5+ years is easy. Part of me still wants to bring her home and try to salvage something, but I know she is toast. I hope someone can make use of her at the junk yard. There are a lot of new parts under all that smushed up crap. I wish I could tell if the engine I just put in there 4 months ago was damaged. I would donate it to someone who was in a tight spot and need it. That thing cost me an arm, leg, and kidney.

**EDIT 4:** Some more proof... Here is the site for my school that shows July 15th is the date for financial aid refunds. Since I paid my tuition to prevent them from dropping my classes, the refund will get direct deposited into my account rather than going toward tuition directly. http://www.tri-c.edu/financialassistance/Pages/ImportantDates.aspx

[Proof of direct deposit from the jobby job](http://i.imgur.com/IRR5T.jpg) I cut out anything personal or too close to the homestead. I have talked about being in Garfield Heights many times, so I don't think cutting that out is necessary. I cut out the company name because we put staff on the website with pics and a lot of info. Oh, and my next check goes in tomorrow. I am sure one might wonder how I am throwing in on the down payment with the balance showing in this pic, but the paycheck will be there minus the health insurance I have to pay.

[Proof of financial aid](http://i.imgur.com/IyAbK.jpg) As I said in the pic, it shows the $1500 pell already set to go out to me on that July 15th date. It shows one loan as offered. There are actually 2 but they are processing paperwork. I spoke to them this morning and she assured me it was normal for it to say one loan even though 2 are going through.

Christian Brown who is a double-amputee was “humiliated” to the point of tears on a Delta flight from Atlanta to Washington after being clumsily wheeled to the back row of the plane.  

He was squeezed into a narrow aviation wheelchair that bumped up against stationary aisle seats as he was wheeled to the rear of the cabin and was obviously humiliated by being paraded through the aircraft and was visibly upset. 

A passenger next to the wounded warrior touched his shoulder and asked if he was okay. She reported that tears rolled down his face, but he did not cry out loud. 

Two fellow passengers offered to give up their seats in First Class, but flight attendants insisted no one could move through the cabin because the doors were being closed for takeoff.

They couldn't take just a few minutes to let this Marine who sacrificed so much for this country to get a better seat on the flight, and let this hero sit in the back of the plane. 

So, here's the deal. I don't want this Marine to ever fly coach again. Ever. 

I'm a former Marine and set up a donation page to raise money for Lance Corporal Brown. Anytime he has a flight in the future, I will use 100% of these funds to upgrade his seat to first or business class. A young Marine who fought for this country and lost two legs in the process, should never be treated the way this Delta flight crew treated him.

For 12 years @ a monthly clinic. They are nonprofit but not 501c3, and need $12k for a laser (huge upgrade in medical EQ). Can you please help me locate some funding, Reddit? (EDIT: To be clear, I am not asking for monetary donations, but help locating a grant for our kind of organization or an actual used/refurbished FDA approved medical laser for tattoo removal.)

I am writing [/r/Assistance](/r/Assistance) because I learned today, from the treasurer (a long-time Redditor and good friend of mine) that the organization is trying to ""save up"" $12,000 for a laser used in medical tattoo removal. Right now, the doctor uses an infra-red, meaning the patient sustain 2nd degree burns. With a laser, they would not get nearly as burned. Importantly, they would not, therefore, need the same level of wound care supplies to take with them. (Because the treatment is a burn, after-care and wound-care is critically important.) Anyway, it would reduce operating costs, patient pain, and healing rate. We'd be able to see more people.


Please help me figure out how to get them a ~$12,000 laser? So they can continue to remove tattoos for free or cheap, for more people, with better results and less pain? Maybe we could apply to the manufacturer? Anyone know how to do that? Are there any foundations who donate to non-federal nonprofits that can document 12 years and hundreds if not thousands of people (and way more tattoos) removed? 

EDIT: We're not an anti-tattoo organization, if that's why you're down-voting. (Some of the volunteers have tattoos.) But there are such things as ""undesirable"" tattoos. Frequent examples include little facial ones, letters on theirs hands and fingers, gang and white power tattoos, ""party dots"", you name it. These things literally keep them from getting a job or into the military. A lot of women getting guys' names removed. This is good work that helps people.

This was their opportunity to catch up on bills and build some savings for retirement (they are 60 and 62, respectively). Then, just after Christmas, Elaine was admitted to the hospital  with pneumonia-like symptoms. One of her lungs was entirely full a blackish-green liquid; the other was 30% full.  After running tests her doctors diagnosed her with terminal stage 4 cancer in the throat, lungs, stomach and back. The cancer is most likely to blame for her recent spiral into dementia, also. They are predicting that she only has less than a month to live.

Richard knows no life without Elaine. They have been married for 36 years and have always worked together. He has decided to leave work and drive her back to drive back to Michigan to spend her final days at home. Due to her illness and lack of health insurance they are experiencing a very difficult time both emotionally and financially. 


In this line of work we are moving from state to state every 3-6 months and working 60+ hours a week, so co-workers become like a second family. I remember the week before Christmas Richard was so excited about a bracelet he bought for Elaine that he gave it to her three days early.  It is devastating to see two of our own suffering so badly. We've started a store donation box to help them out but I though I would turn to reddit to seek further assistance. I'm not really sure how this will work, but I know reddit has done tremendous things to help others throughout the years. Anything to bring a smile to Elaine or Richard would be so appreciated. Comment or PM me if you want to help in any way.

A will also be help and bringing as many people out of homelessness as I possipley can along the way. All the while filming my life experences as a homeless person.

I have quite a few followers now. I'm going to have a lot more when I get going. I have had a little help from then (my supporters) but none of it in way of funding, whitch is why I'm hear today.

Currently I'm in a bit of a rut as far as getting support to get me started on my trip. My computer is old, bulky, and going to die. It will not last a month on the road. I also need some camping gear. I was danated a video camara from a friend and fellow advocat, however, It doesent work, go figure.

These are the few things I need. Any funds I have left over will go to helping homeless people as I walk.

I'm asking for a 1$ Donation from eash of you to get me on my way properly and efectivly.

Here is the scoop.  After he gave the kidney to Maritza in March of 2010, her brother decided to give him a 1996 Mustang GT convertible. My brother LOVES this car, it's his only form of transportation.  

In december of 2010 the fan burnt out on the car.  It overheated and all sorts of things got messed up.  We recently got a quote and the car needs a motor re-build.  

I'm not here to ask for money, but I'm here to see if you all know of any shops that would be willing to work on his car Overhaulin' style considering the things he has done.  Maybe a TV show that would be willing to help him out.

I'd love to do all the applications, I just need to be pointed in the right direction.  Even if you don't know an Upvote would be appreciated so that we can expose it to as most people as possible.

Thank you!

**Update: I have posted this on a few forums and sent it to a couple of businesses that might be interested in helping.  If you know anyone, please forward it for me.**

&gt;To whom it may concern: 

A response would be greatly appreciated even if it's just to say that you can't be of help. I have decided to write to a number of companies and I'm not sure how this is going to turn out.

My brother's story is a rough one. In August of 2009 he found out that his wife had been cheating on him. He decided to leave her, and everything in Texas, and he moved with my to Miami, FL. After living here for 2 months he started working as an Assistant to myself, and it is how he met Maritza. 

Maritza is a 41 year old woman who has been suffering from Lupus since 1999. She developed End Stage Renal Disease, and needed a kidney donation. We're not sure why, but this 22 year old (at the time) kid, who had no reason to be in Miami, stepped up and decided to get checked to be a living donor. Within 2 weeks he got his initial blood tests, and was a positive match. Four months of testing, and anticipation came to a surprising discovery. This guy, who had never met this woman, was a better match both physically and genetically that her own brother. It's funny how the world works. To fast forward a bit, on March 25th of 2010 my little brother gave his kidney to save a woman's life.

Her family was so overwhelmed with gratitude, that they decided to give him a car. A 1996 Mustang GT Convertible, not just any car, but his dream car. Unfortunately, the car has brought him nothing but problems since day one. It began with a bad alignment, and is at the point of bad piston rings, transmission, rear end, suspension, etc. The kid is a car fanatic, who has immense plans for this machine. He has a grocery list of parts, but no funds to get it.

I'm not necessarily looking for a handy me out but the car has gotten to the point where he needs to either replace it, or park it and ride a bus. I hate to see him stressed out, especially around his anniversary. What I am looking to do is get the car done for him a'la Overhaulin'. The media exposure would be so exorbitant for your company, I'll make sure of it. I would've written to those shows, but unfortunately they have been canceled. So I will take it upon myself to make sure every forum, media outlet, and news station hears the story of the shops that made a hero's dream come true.

Please, if you can't help try to point me in the direction of someone who can. I've also posted this on a couple of forums, reddit.com, and written to the admins of some of the larger Mustang oriented forums.

Proof can be emailed, for serious inquiries.

Emails to lovematthew18@yahoo.com would be preferred so that he doesn't find this but he is gone for the weekend, and I changed his password.

In February, I lost all of my top teeth and some of my bottom from a mixture of things. I wasn't brought up in such a great home, I suffer from a couple of gastrointestinal disorders and because of it, I've been severely underweight for almost 9 years and suffered a chain reaction of health issues. I don't want to bore with the details but my teeth were a casualty.

I lost the ability to have a job and was put on disability. The endless loop starts where I pay my rent, get some food and that's it. I'm broke for 2 weeks and outside for cans and bottles to buy more food. 

I made a call two weeks ago to a denture clinic that someone suggested. The price is considerably cheaper than the first place I went. The problem is, I simply don't have it. I'm thankful that I'm covered by disabilities insurance program but not fully. It'll still be 150$ for my new teeth.

I've been going against doctors orders and desperately seeking simple jobs to gain some income that I can use for my teeth. 14 applications later and no one will hire me. I could be wrong, but it could be the fact that I am 82 pounds with no teeth. It saddens me but it doesn't stop me. 

I'm trying to get on the path to a better life. I want a job, I want my own place and I want my independence. I can't be disabled anymore. I won't be.

Need assistance for vet bills.,empathyx,55,14,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1cyoop/one_of_our_cats_broke_both_its_back_legs_need/,"**19 hours later Edit** One person has offered to help what they can. Nothing sent yet and no other offers. Please help if you can. Thanks again or reading all of this.  
From the beginning: [Original Story](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h7iky/i_found_a_pregnant_cat_with_3_legs_not_karma/)    
I found a 3 legged pregnant street cat almost 2 years ago (I am living in Turkey and I appreciate the suggestions of SPCA and other organizations I see in other threads about help for dogs and cats but they do not help me here as far as assistance). She had three babies, one died in the first week sadly...so we still have her two boys, and we love them but it has been a constant battle with bills and finding a place to live (not everyone loves cats here) I never regret the decision, so much love and great memories and laughs just lots of stress and money taking care of them.  
That being said we are living in an apartment on the fourth floor. We recently decided we should give them to a friend with a farm for health reasons for us (we have to keep our cats in the room with us, litter boxes and all which has effected my girlfriends skin and my breathing at times) and we want them to have more room to be young and run around...luckily we have a balcony to keep the litter boxes in. Unluckily the balcony is not very safe...one of the cats (Togepi) on Saturday night fell off the balcony and broke both it's back legs...badly. We took it to one of the only 24/7 clinics we could find.  
Today the cat had surgery on it's back legs and everything went well and he is doing better but the road of recovery will be long.  
   
   
I am asking today for money for vet bills. We managed to cover the surgery with money we borrowed and can pay back soon (they needed it in cash...1650 Lira...roughly $950, they brought in a specialist for our cat's legs). Our bank accounts are emptied and there are more expenses. We will try to borrow some more money from friends but who knows when we can pay them back. The cat will stay at the vet for another 3 days, my girlfriend has been staying there over night with him while I go home at night to be with our other cats and go to work during the day.  
The vet stay so far has been $500 and 3 more days the cost all depends if he needs more IV's and medication...and he may require more surgery eventually.  
This is getting long so I will post photos here and just say anything anyone is willing to offer is greatly appreciated. I am hoping the karma of taking in these cats will be repaid a little.  
[The vet took this photo post surgery](http://i.imgur.com/evWnD6H.jpg) (I am Canadian and one of the vets was as well so it was sweet of them to make that heart)  
[Pins in the legs](http://i.imgur.com/181KzzK.jpg) after surgery. I will update this perhaps because the vet said she would send us photos pre-op...they said the bones were like a puzzle...shattered. Poor cat.

I am hoping to pay this forward as I really don't know when I would be able to pay back a loan to anyone who gives.  
Thank you for reading all of this and just thank you for being a part of this subreddit for people in need it is a great thing to see such helpful people who can give. I wish I had more to give.

I asked real-dreamer to comment (see below) to show that I do pay things forward when I can, I did not tell her what to write. We have since become good friends after I saw her need for assistance.

It's about 20 minutes north of LA right near Six Flags Magic Mountain. For the past 3 years we have worked tirelessly to develop our own ice cream recipes from scratch. We will serve an all-natural ice cream that is ""homemade"" daily in our store with nothing but natural ingredients (save a few flavors). EVERYTHING a customer gets in their hands is biodegradable and our store is built around a concept of no waste.

For the past 3 years we've sunk our life savings in to building the brand, concept, recipes, equipment and testing. There is nothing else out here like this and this first store is our prototype for future expansion. Our other company is a web development firm, so being in the industry we thought one creative way of financing the construction of the shop would be through a Kickstarter campaign.

We just launched our Kickstarter late last week and we're working tirelessly to get the word out. Even more importantly, if you love ice cream or like to support new businesses who bring quality food with a skew towards social and environmental responsibility, please check out our Kickstarter campaign. We have rewards starting as low as $5 and we will even ship ice cream to non-local backers. Any support, large or small, we are extremely grateful for.

If nothing else, please like us on Facebook, share our Kickstarter post or share our story with some friends. We're doing everything we can to get this store open.

Memories About my Mom on FaceBook

https://www.facebook.com/groups/roxannedanielsmemorial/

Something I wrote about my mom immediately following her death.

 Mom you were my whole world you always made everything better. I don't know what I'm going to do without you. No one has the heart you had, your soul, your happiness, your love, your kind words, your amazing smile, your guidance, you were the most inspiring person! I will always think of you every day, every hour, every minute; you did everything for Sierra and I. I can't believe this happened. I need you, I want you back! Everywhere I look I'm reminded of you. You were the best mother any family could ask for. I loved seeing your face light up. Someday I will tell my kids about the amazing person you were. I'm so devastated I wish I came to the party. I'm so sorry life is so crazy and my heart is going to have an empty space until I get to see you in heaven. No one can understand how I grieve and how much I miss you and no one understands the bond we had.

Thanks to the generous donations, today, Lexie went to the vet and they ran a few tests on him. Thankfully, he doesn't have heartworms, but he does have Lyme Disease and the vet thinks his cough may be kennel cough. He's been put on antibiotics for the Lyme Disease and we were told it might help his cough. However, they'll still have to do x-rays to find out what's causing his cough. The x-rays will cost $245 plus $35 for the appointment. Therefore, we're seeking money to help cover those costs.

21 year old Harison Long-Randall lost his leg as a result of a drunk/drugged driver hitting him, his girlfriend Gemily and their 4 Australian Cattle Dogs near Sacramento, California Monday night 7/16/12. Harison put himself between Gemily and the car which was going 80 mph on a residential street. The 4 dogs were killed- their bodies flung 50-60 feet away. Gemily received a compound fracture of her lower leg. Harison was wishboned- his lower body torn in two, one leg ripped off at mid thigh and thrown across the street, his pelvis shattered, he has extensive internal damage and is still in the Critical care ICU in Sacramento, but his brain and spine are miraculously undamaged. Neighbors flooded out into the street upon hearing the commotion and kept him alive until the Ambulance arrived. He will need a lot of rehabilitation and physical therapy and an expensive prosthesis, he doesn't have very good insurance, his family is not wealthy by any means.
I am a family friend- I want to help them get what they need for Harisons and Gemilys medical care and rehabilitation. I will try to post pictures if I can figure out how to do it (this is my first Reddit post) and i will update this post to keep those who care informed of any changes as they occur and how the kids are doing.
Harison is not somebody who was expected to be brave-he is just a normal young guy-  but in sacrificing himself to save his girlfriend, he proved himself worthy of the best care and finest future possible given his circumstances.

If you want to compensate for the services, you are welcome to do so and the funds will go back towards helping more people.

The two are interlinked so closely that in retrospect they are one and the same thing. For in the absence of either, neither could exist. I wondered for years about the nature of everything, including the concept of everything, and those before me who have asked the very same questions, in one sense or another. It is by nature a path into the void, leaving those who dare venture down that path puzzled, confused, scared, and overwhelmed. For some the search in overwhelming and debilitating, the inability to let the questions go for some, has lead them right into the unyielding arms of insanity. I am one that has traveled such a journey. I could not, for a period of time, function in the manner most would consider sane, being engulfed by the absurdity of everything, I was left to find a path back to this reality.

This state of mentality was brought about by a panic attack that struck me out of the blue while I was laying in my bed one night. I had never experienced one, and did not know what was happening to me, to truly and accurately describe in words the dread, fear, chaos, and confusion one goes through during a severe panic attack would be futile at best. It was--in the most conservative terms--the most terrifying experience of my life. Had I had the option to choose death at the climax of that experience, I would not have thought twice, but I got through it even though I was sure my end was playing itself out. Setting in motion a trend, many other panic attacks continued to over take me, striking me without the slightest hint of premonition. As a result I was left with general anxiety that consumed me every minute of every day. This state lasted continuously for two months, near the end I had lost weight, strength, and the will to continue on living, contemplating suicide and the best manner to go about it, I was hanging on by just a thread. As a last attempt to regain a will, I turned to a mental establishment, and was admitted for three weeks, where through trial and error the doctors found the correct combination of drugs to re-stabilize me and give me hope. For the first time in months, I enjoyed periods of normality and sanity. It was a luxury for me now, one I could never have concived that I could lose, the separation between what is considered sanity and what is considered insanty was made clear to me. It is a arbitrary line that is so indefinitely narrow, one could convincingly argue that such a division could not exist.

In the midst of all this turmoil, something beyond the the sensations of anxiety was taking place. Not only was my perception of the universe changing, but the very act of experiencing perception was now different, it was no longer a passive experience, but had become an engaging phenomenon. My perception had left the realm of singularity and entered the realm of duplicity, resulting in the perception of perception. I became an audience of this being and its interaction with the universe around it. I was now existing in three realms, the core-self, the self, and the platform otherwise known as the cosmos. It was more foreign to me than any language I had every heard, more foreign than the strangers that would scim by me in busy bus terminals, more foreign than the principles that govern world of quantum physics. It was as though I had been living in a two dimensional world and was thrown unexpectedly into a three dimensional one. As hard as I tried to verbalize to the world around me what i was experiencing, I could not, not even the tiniest inkling of it seem to resonate in the minds of those who listened. To them, it was the anxiety over taking me, to me, it was the reality of reality that was overtaking me.

How I wondered, how could I return to the state in which life was simply life, the universe--though mysterious--still just a universe. Minutes would turn into hours, hours into days, days to weeks, and weeks to months. My patience was on its final stretch, what was it that I was trying to regain, or what was it I wanted to relinquish, not knowing what to aim for to restore things as they once were, i was suffused in confusion and desperation. It occurred to me that this was a one way journey to a place from which the ability to return from it were little more than the dreams of a visionary poet. How could I be here,

I have contacted one of you about this problem and nothing has been done and I feel I have an ethical obligation, under law, to make the following statement:

To the people of r/Assistance:

After reviewing and responding to the umpteenth post for legal advice in order to correct bad advice given by a non-lawyer on this forum, I felt it was important to explain why non-lawyers shouldn't be giving people legal advice.

There is a reason attorneys are required to go through rigorous education and testing in order to obtain their licenses, and that this process must be repeated for each and every state in the US (and each foreign jurisdiction): the law is more complicated than you can possibly imagine and the stakes for a person with legal issues are incredibly high.

Whether a person's legal problem is criminal or civil (including issues of family law, bankruptcy, taxation, immigration, involuntary commitment, and foreclosure) the consequences of relying on bad legal advice can be dire.  This is why attorneys on Reddit do not provide legal advice over the internet, but will provide legal information--usually to contact a lawyer in the requesters jurisdiction.  In order to properly advise someone, lawyers need a lot of information.  Any of you who have been represented by an attorney before might remember how many seemingly bizarre and/or personal questions he or she may have asked you.  This is because this information is integral to providing appropriate legal advice.  It is as important as having an understanding of the relevant law.

Many times, well meaning redditors in this community provide G-d awful advice to people.  Relying on this information could cause these people to make poor choices, or to forego getting an attorney when they really need one.  The consequences in some cases may be small, but in others, they could be life changing.  They could be the difference between remaining in ones home and being foreclosed upon or evicted.  The difference between being able to file suit due to an injury and missing a deadline and thus never being able to recover for that injury.  I know that the advice that is given here is well-intentioned, but more often than not it isn't just incorrect, but the exact opposite of what an attorney would advise.

All 50 states make the unlicensed practice of law a crime for this reason exactly.

So, please, I implore you, *stop providing legal advice*.  In the side bar, there is a link that provides information on the Legal Services Corporation (free legal aid organizations) for each and every state.  If a person is asking for legal advice, refer them there.  A ten minute phone call with an attorney licensed in that person's jurisdiction could make a huge, positive difference in their life, whereas your decision to provide advice despite your ignorance could cause daunting negative consequences.

**TL;DR You are not an attorney, and there's a reason for that.  It is dangerous and illegal for you to provide legal advice to others.  Instead, refer people to the link for legal aid info in the sidebar**",,False,,t5_2s25d,False,,advice,True,t3_mfot2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/mfot2/you_may_not_realize_the_harm_you_may_be_doing/,

Some of you may remember my previous [Post about Eric about 6 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/zja09/any_help_appreciated_for_a_toddler_named_eric_and/)  He lost his battle and passed away about two hours ago. 

His prognosis was looking great 4 weeks ago. He had one kidney removed and many many sessions of Chemo and Radiation. They noticed something off so they took him back to surgery to see what was going on. His cancer spread through his whole body and there was nothing any doctor could do. We knew he had a VERY small chance of survival when he was diagnosed, but we let ourselves get hopeful. 

I didn't come here to ask for anything except thoughts and prayers for his family. I do know the family had already planned and put a funeral on a payment plan since they couldn't afford to pay it up-front. So many thanks to the funeral home for doing this for this young family.

I have never had a child myself, and this is one of the reasons why so, I cannot even begin to fathom the pain they are going through at this time. I just need you all to send out good vibes for them in this extremely tough time. 

I want to thank anyone that commented or PMed me before. Even without raising cash donations, your kind words were worth much more at the time. 

Thank you for reading. I have included some pictures of his last days just to show you how strong he was to make sure he kept people around him happy until the end. Please note that these are in a hospital setting and may be a little upsetting to some. He refused to go home because he wanted to ""get better"" and thought that by staying there, he would.

The only car I have is in her name and I think she just canceled the insurance on the car (still checking).  

To be honest and embarrassingly enough I have an appointment Monday for food stamps and welfare money (kids have to eat) because she left me with $40.00 to my name.  The bad part is I have over $600+ from Google that will be deposited in her bank account July 1, 2012.  It was too late for me to change the bank account to the new one that I just opened.  I honestly don’t know if she is going to give me the money or not.  

The last two years have been horrible for me because my dad died two years ago, my grandma died last year and now my wife leaves me without any rhyme or reason.   So I am asking you all my friends a favor if you can.  Will you let all your friends know about my two websites?

Will you also let anyone you know that I need a job?  For the most part I am computer technical but the problem is I have had one job in the last eight years.  The reason being is my son has Asperger’s syndrome(hasn’t been officially diagnosed but the school system seems to think so) and he needed me to stay home with him.   This was my wife’s idea by the way and when it came time to go to work my wife also decided that it was time for my youngest son to be home-schooled.  

Life has thrown me a lot of curve balls in the last couple of years but I know with your help, a positive attitude and my work ethic I know I can succeed.  

A word of advice for you; never ever let your spouse control the money, house, cars, bills, etc.  This is the issues that I am having now.  The car and house are in her name but do to the fact we are married they are half mine in the eyes of the court.  I am safe for the time being until such time as she decided to file for divorce.

Hello, Reddit.  I am writing to ask for your help to win a new handicapped-accessible van for me. For Mobility Awareness Month, a contest is being held for a chance to win 1 of 3 new accessible vans. To get into the raffle, I must get as many votes as possible and be in the top 10%. So I am asking Reddit to help me by voting for me in this contest.

A little about me:  I'm a 25 year old quadriplegic (paralyzed below my chest) from Oklahoma City. Last August, I had an accident in my van; when the tire blew out, it pulled me into the concrete barrier on the highway. I'm fine, but my van was totaled and now I have little hope of getting a van (which is absurdly priced) in any other way than this contest. I've been stuck at home since August, aside from a handful of times when someone could help me. It's been rough. But I'll be heading to grad school (through a scholarship and misc loans) in the fall, and I desperately need to have a reliable way of getting to and from class every day, as well as being able to get out of the house more than a few times per month. 

Please help me, Reddit, by voting for me at http://www.nmeda.com/mobility-awareness-month/heroes/oklahoma/norman/1948/kyle-morrison. Please use the promo code 817 to make each vote count as 5 votes. You can vote once every 24 hours from each device (IP  address) you have access to. The contest ends in 4 days, so please help me get as many votes as possible. I need this van to help me get where I want to be, literally. Thanks.

I'm in the NY area, but considering that I no longer have anything here, I'd be willing to travel anywhere via bus.

Please allow me to give a brief rundown of the events that have gotten me into this situation.

My mom was diagnosed with cancer in September of 2008, two weeks later my father died from a heart attack.  As the primary caregiver for my mom I was unwilling to find any work during the 9 months she was sick.  I don't regret this.

She passed away in May of 2009, and I was completely devastated.  I didn't realize how much I was actually affected until I started going to bereavement counseling.  My brother and his wife came back into my life soon after her death, and moved back into our childhood home with me.

I was happy to have them in my life, I put all my trust into my brother because I had no other choice.  I was broken and an anxious shaky mess.  I needed to heal.

In October of  2009 I realized the mistake I made when I learned that my brother had been addicted to heroin and cleaned out my accounts as well as the house account.  His wife of 1 year left him... she had it easy, in hindsight I wish I could have divorced him as well.

I insisted that he go to rehab, and foolishly believed he was better when it was done. Despite repeated warnings from my therapist I continued to believe his lies and support him.  I was weak, I didn't want to believe that the only person I had left would screw me over like this.  I wanted to believe he was better.  I was wrong, he again cleaned out the the accounts and left me for broke.  He's actually doing better then I am at the moment because he's a bloody conman, and found a girl to believe his lies and lives with her now.  I warned her, but she didn't listen.

If anyone wants to help out financially you can send paypal payment to the email in my profile.

I will try to respond back to any questions as fast as I can, but I'm on a borrowed computer atm and will have to go to the library to check the responses.

I should also mention that I'm in the process of asking the State for help, but those gears move slowly.

1352208646.0,41,self.Assistance,12q74l,[Request] Six year Redditor trying to stave off homelessness for his family for one more month.,specialkake,44,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/12q74l/request_six_year_redditor_trying_to_stave_off/,"Ok, so here's our story:

We are a couple in their mid-30's. We have a four year old son, and another son due in February. Last year, my wife's estranged sister (who has some mental problems) convinced us to move from Daytona Beach, FL to a small town in Northern Georgia. My wife is the  most empathetic person in the world, and saw it as a chance to repair her broken relationship with her sister. It seemed like a cheap place to live, and I figured even at $10 an hour, we'd be able to survive here. I would kill for $10 an hour now.

My wife just finished her Master's in Education in Guidance and Counseling, and is doing her unpaid internship. I have applied at over 200 jobs in the area, and haven't even gotten a call back. I work in non-profit mental health, and prior to moving, I had planned to get a job with one of several mental health organizations here. They all closed down or moved within months of us moving here. We were surviving on my GI Bill. However, now that I am in my last month of school (My Bachelor's in Psychology) we no longer have that. I've applied everywhere, even the local chicken processing plant, and I never even get a callback. Locals that I've talked to say that no one will hire outsiders here, much less a New Englander like me, when the unemployment is so high here. They only hire their own.

My mother used to own two natural medicine stores, one in Harvard Square, another in Palo Alto. After 9/11, she lost them both, went bankrupt, and now makes minimum wage at 60 years old. My father lost most of his retirement during the recent crash, and was laid off as Vice President of the company he had worked at for 20 years. There are also some relationship problems there, he hasn't even sent my son a present for birthday or christmas in years. I think my stepmother has a problem with us. I'm not sure if it's because my wife is Hispanic, or we're not religious, or because my son was born out of wedlock. They just aren't there for us.

We are probably going to have to move in with my wife's mother in Orlando. They fight constantly, which my wife is dreading, but at least her mother is willing to let us stay there in Orlando until we can figure things out. The problem is, my wife's internship won't end until Dec. 15th, and we need to survive until then. We also need to be able to pack everything we own into our minivan, and make it from here to Orlando.

Anything anyone can do to help would be life-saving. Both my wife and myself are trying to devote our lives to helping people, and I assure you any help you can offer would be repaid into the community many times over in our lifetimes. Even if it's a remote job I can do, like data entry, etc. I will gladly take it. If you have a family member with a business in Gilmer/Pickens/Fannin Counties in Northern Georgia, I would also work there. I don't care what it is. I am a US Coast Guard veteran, I worked for a Fortune 500 Commercial Title Insurance company, and worked in non-profit mental health for years. I am great with computers, any sort of office work, etc. I just want to survive until I can get the hell out of here.",,False,,t5_2s25d,False,,,True,t3_12q74l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/12q74l/request_six_year_redditor_trying_to_stave_off/,

Original Post:
My girlfriend is a therapeutic support worker who works with families of autistic children in their home and at school. 1-in-88 children will be diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder. 
She and I will both be participating in the Walk Now for Autism Speaks in Pittsburgh, PA next Saturday, June 9th. Autism Speaks is an organization that raises money for Autism awareness and research.

Please help her reach her goal of $100. I apologize in advance for the fact that Autism Speaks only accepts donations of $20 or more. All donations are tax deductible. We would love to set up a way to donate less than $20 but are uncomfortable using PayPal, what with their history of withholding transfers and their high fees. (Any suggestions for this are appreciated.)

Big ups to redditor salisburymistake for donating $20 when I first posted this in /r/AskReddit (which I now know is against the rules of that subreddit.) He was the first person period who donated anything and kept her from showing up on Saturday with $0 in donations.

She has wanted one since she was a little girl and freaks out whenever she sees one. We went to pick one out last week and she fell in love with Pete the pug. We spent 2 of the best days of her life with the little guy and he started not eating on the 3rd day. By the 4th day we had to take him to the emergency vet clinic. He has lost a pound (and being only 2.5 pounds that is quite a lot of weight). We discovered that his white blood cells were low and was having a hard time fighting an infection that remains a mystery. We have spent over $2500 on him already and have spent as much as we can possibly afford. I wouldn't ask this from you reddit, but my girlfriend's birthday is in one week today and I cannot stand the idea of her having to put him down on her birthday.

YAY!  :)",sezzme,41,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/fjvf3/just_want_to_say_thank_you_rassistance_several/,"I am a breast cancer patient who had been seriously needing a med called Nerontin to help heal some nasty nerve damage caused by chemotherapy.  

I had been been suffering from no feeling in my toes plus I had some really bad stiffness in my lower body.  I had been shuffling slowly like an old lady for several months, which meant I wasn't walking very much.  I was already taking Flexeril (a good med in itself), but that wasn't enough.

My oncologist wanted me to get on Nerontin to heal the damaged nerves.  However because this med costs around 55 bucks at Wal-mart.  I was stuck between a choice between food and that prescription.  I have no prescription insurance.

After posting here asking for some way to offer my Photoshop skills for money (I was too @#$%! proud to actually ask for funds directly) one Redditor let me in on a secret: Nerontin could be gotten at Cosco for around 16 bucks without a membership.  A second, separate Redditor donated 60 dollars for my prescription.  

So I got the Nerontin from Cosco, which left some $ left over.  I honestly wondered if it was OK to use the rest for food... or should I refund the balance back to the donor or what?  (I guess I have an overactive conscience.) 

So I asked the second Redditor about this.  They said it was OK for me to keep the rest of the $ and pay it forward someday.  YAY!  Brown rice, veggies AND Nerontin!  Cool!  :)

Things have changed since then.  After several weeks on Nerontin and some painkillers, I am now walking fairly normally.  The feeling in my toes has come back.  I am a LOT less stiff and more coordinated than I was.  I don't have to go up the stairway where I live by using both hands on the banister to pull the rest of my body upwards.  Walking up the stairs with a ""Look ma! No hands!"" feeling is awesome.  :)

Lately, things are also starting to look up just a little bit for me financially as well as physically.  I hope to be able to pay it all forward sooner than later.  For now, I can at least offer an occasional creative idea or positive thought here on Assistance, which I hope can help some folks.

Really. And this kid wants to go to explosives camp for a week this summer, really, really bad. 

 I wish his dad and I had the $1350 to send him. It seems such a small amount, really. And money that we would have had, if not for his dad's employment situation. I'm a stay at home mom and his dad is an independent contractor in the web design business. We have been up and down this year in terms of finances and at this point, we are going through our savings pretty quickly as he is between contracts and has been for several weeks.

My son is a junior in high school. He is very interested in engineering and is planning a future in the pyrotechnic or digital engineering field. This camp will help him gain real life experience and a safe immersion into how explosives work and will help him determine if this is the field for him.

We all remember what it was like our first year or two of college, everyone asking what your major is, what do you want to be when you grow up. Those questions used to drive me crazy. 

With limited funds, and almost no financial help from us (given our own situation), he's going to have to rely on scholarships as much as possible. He's already secured funding for his first two years at a community college, but the rest will depend on him. I don't want him to miss out on opportunities that I feel he really needs, just because his dad and I can't afford them.

I promise that any funds you donate will be strictly used for his explosives camp fees. Any remainder will be used to help with school costs such as track fees, or marching band fees, both of which he is heavily involved in, and really quite good, even if I am a little biased. :)

Thank you in advance for your gift, no matter the size. We literally couldn't do this without you.

The TL;DR is:

I’m am frightened. I need ideas on how to raise money for my friend’s surgery.  My good friend Tyese needs brain surgery to live as she has a 6 year old girl.   The laser surgery which has shown to be effective is currently only available in the U.S..  The cost is $70.000 to $100,000.

So far we are doing:

1. Her former work is putting on a fundraiser - not sure when.
2. Her Highschool friend is a hypnotist in Vegas, Anthony Cools.  He will donate all proceeds from a special show to her surgery.  But we need to get people through the door as it is not on one of his regular show nights at Paris on the strip. (it’s an adult show!)
3. www.savetyese.com   We have just set up a blog called “Save Tyese”   where people can donate and we will be doing a facebook blast to all our friends to raise money.


What else can we do?? Is there somewhere else this should be posted? Does the blog work?  Not sure how to get 250 people through the doors to a vegas show from Canada on an unscheduled night.. Any ideas would be appreciated.  Help spread the word.

If I have breached Reddit protocol, please let me know. I’ve been on here a while, and know this type of thing can sometimes be a minefield.

The long story is I have known Tyese for 25 years and she is an awesome person.  We spent our university years hanging out and have been an important part of each others lives.   We have been out of touch for the last few years, though.   I have just reconnected with her and and am playing catch up with the situation!

Here is her story from the blog that we set up on friday: savetyese.com  

“Please save my life. I may only have a few months to live unless I receive laser surgery for removal of a brain tumour.
I am desperate. I have a six year old daughter  who needs her mommy and I need this surgery to survive.
My name is Tyese xxxx  and in October 2010 I found a lump in my breast and went for a biopsy , mammogram and an ultrasound. The results of the biopsy came back negative.
Two months later I noticed a lump under my arm. I went back for a second biopsy and this time it showed that I had breast cancer that had spread to my lymph nodes and possibly my spine.
After six months of chemotherapy I was cancer free and feeling healthy. Soon however I started to get headaches. An MRI revealed a brain tumour.   I am still cancer free everywhere else.
Since my journey or battle has begun two years ago I have had a double mastectomy, radiation and two brain surgeries.   Unfortunately it is difficult to get the whole tumour with conventional knife surgery and the tumour has returned.
There is a specialized AutoLITT laser technology which is far more precise and effective than conventional knife surgery. Unfortunately this is only available in the States at the moment and is costly at 70 to 100 k. Again, I am desperate. My six year old daughter Taiya needs her mommy.

We have to pay for food, spay &amp; neuter, litter, meds, flea products, vet bills. The reality is that our only source of income is adoption fees and donations. People think that we get free vet services. We do have a wonderful vet that discounts our bills but they are not free. We buy our food from Costco's, Petco and Pet Supermarket just like you do. We are constantly seeking grants and donations from manufacturers and distributors but donations are few and far between. We are asking for your help now. We do not have enough funds to last another month. Some people simply can't afford to donate, some choose other charities or causes to support. We spend every penny of donations right here in South Florida and you are always welcome to visit our adoption centers to see your dollars at work!

A close family friend graduated from college and opened an orphanage in Botswana with her roommate. Together, they have worked with local women to grow this wonderful seed into a very special place for sick and abandoned children in the village.

However, because the orphanage is still very young, they continue to struggle with money. My grandmother is a veritable saint and has taken it upon herself to crochet hats and blankets for each of the children who are staying at the orphanage as a way of helping out from halfway across the world.

This is my grandmother's passion. She loves to crochet and has created and given away hundreds of handmade items for free, all made from materials that she purchased herself. It would absolutely mean the world to her if you would help her send her creations to Botswana.

I have set up a funding campaign on IndieGoGo (the same site as the Tesla Museum campaign) and I am asking for $500.00. This amount will help cover shipping, yarn reimbursement, and allow her to buy more skeins of yarn to continue making blankets and hats.

We are offering rewards to those who help us out. They range from having your name put onto a contributors list in a letter that we're sending to the orphanage with the blankets, to a hand-crocheted blanket made by my grandmother. Any help you can offer would be amazing.

Thanks guys!

My sister recently entered me into a Local Heroes contest in honor of National Mobility Awareness Month.  The sponsors will award three customized wheelchair-accessible vans at the conclusion of a contest.  This would mean a great deal, as my van is falling apart.  I have been trapped inside due to broken doors, and was stranded on another occasion for five hours by the highway due to different mechanical issues.  New vans cost around $50,000, and I have less than 1% of that in my bank account.

Despite having spinal muscular atrophy, a degenerative neuromuscular disorder that requires the use of a wheelchair and help from caregivers, I am active in the community.  I have two graduate degrees, serve on two non-profit Boards of Directors, and guide State disability policy as a member of the Governor's Council on People with Disabilities.  I play wheelchair soccer, and was Ms. Wheelchair Indiana 2009.  Reliable transportation, in the form of a new van, would help me continue this activity and do even more.

You can help me get a van by voting here every 24 hours through May 13: http://www.nmeda.com/mobility-awareness-month/heroes/indiana/indianapolis/477/emily-munson.

Situation: Me and my girlfriend have been trough some troubles and decided to rent an appartment. 
My girlfriend (called Liza) really loves the chrismas atmosphere and loves sending cards to all the people she knows. But last year... She only got 4 back 'cause most of the cards she got the years before were for her parents and sis' too, she was really sad about this but except from sending some cards to my own adress there was nothing i could really do. 

Now as i discovered reddit and this subreddit i came up with an idea, ... 
She always talk about redditors as if they are a bit freaky (i like to go on gaming subreddits so sometime.. people are a bit freaky i guess;) ) but I want to show her that reddit is a great community of people helping eachother with all kinds of problems.
So i have got a question for you, my fellow redditors; would you please send her an x-mass card? It doesnt have to be one of those expensive   noise making cards, just a simple letter or card is enough! 
She would love the gesture and im sure she will be convinced that reddit has warm-hearthed people too! :)

I would have added a picture of her 2 cats (they are massive!), because it seems that reddit likes cats alot, but her computer crashed so i cant find any of them... But when she gets back from the store and if it got fixed (and the pictures are still on it) I will add them =) 

I will add an adress here, and  i know it is not adviced to give your whole adress but the adress im giving is a neutral adress, one where she can pick up her mail (I dont know if you are familiar with this kind of adress but its something local), its not our adress because of obvious reasons. 
Also, the adress is in Belgium and i'm aware that alot of people here are from the USA, so really... if the costs are 2 high (i dont have any idea how much it costs) you dont have to do it! I dont want you to spend to much money on it either


Thanks alot already, she will be glad if she gets more than 4 cards this year, and I will be glad too. 

Ps. as I indicated, my native language is not English, so sorry for all the grammar errors etc.
Pss. I erased the adress because of people telling me to not just publish it, so please pm me if you want the adress =)  
* EDIT: PC -crashed: no pictures of cats :'(
* EDIT: if you want do send something specific (like some people asked for), she loves ballet and dancing =) 
* EDIT: Thanks to everyone who has already sent a card, I will PM you if it got here! :D

Some of you might remember me, most not. I come asking a small favor of assistance for my grandmother, who is currently in the hospital and not doing well at all. I'll start off with the reason I'm asking for assistance.

I am looking to somehow get in contact with the famous rockstar Alice Cooper. Long story short, my grandmother's name is Alice Cooper, and it is something that she has always been proud of, and constantly asked about. I'd like to be able to at the least contact either Alice Cooper's manager, or Alice Cooper himself in regards to my grandmother. I want to give her something that would really make her happy, something even as simple as a letter from Alice Cooper himself.

I know anything is possible with the internet, and remembering the soldier who asked Mila Kunis to the Marine Ball made me think about this.

My grandmother is a survivor of breast cancer, and now suffers from Alzheimer's Disease. She is now barely hanging on due to her advanced stage of Alzheimer's, as well as the two heart attacks she has suffered in the past 3 months. And now her kidneys are failing her. I've made an [IAmA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/im8p0/my_grandparents_both_have_alzheimers_and_i_am/) about my grandmother a few months ago if you're looking for proof.

I've thought about going along the same lines as the Marine who asked Mila Kunis to the Ball, and making a Youtube video, but I just can't string my thoughts together well enough to do that. So I came here to see what can be done first.

I'd appreciate any help that you can provide. As always, you folks always manage to deliver in one way or another.

**EDIT 1** They've just decided to move her to ICU, and have intubated her. It looks like time is running out :/

**EDIT 2** They've put her on morphine to make her comfortable, and have said that she most likely won't make it through the night. I appreciate the help, but it appears I was too late :(

1) If you live in the USA, you can get a GoogleVoice number in your area code for free. Just go to voice.google.com

2) Give out the GoogleVoice number instead of your real cell phone number...put it on job applications, give it to friends and family, etc. Don't give out your real cell phone number at all.

3) Then you tell GoogleVoice to forward all calls and texts to your ACTUAL cell phone number. 

This way, if you decide to change cell companies, you just change the pointer in GoogleVoice, and boom...all the calls go to the new (actual) number, but nobody else needs to change their listing for you. If you run out of money and your cell gets cancelled, it doesn't matter. Just un-forward your GoogleVoice settings, and it will continue taking voice-mails which you can check online.

Bonus: even if your el-cheapo actual cell phone plan doesn't include things like call-block, GoogleVoice does, so you can block certain numbers and they get a ""number disconnected"" announcement, while everybody else gets right through. GoogleVoice has also recently added a ""global spam caller"" list, which (if you turn it on) automatically dumps all spam callers to instant voicemail.",,False,,t5_2s25d,False,,heart,True,t3_jhms7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/jhms7/suggestion_how_to_never_worry_about_getting_your/,

I started traveling and I've been criss crossing the country aimlessly for the past six years with a few stops here and there to try and build a life. Most of the time some thing disastrous happens.

I'll skip the messy details and jump to my current situation. I just got a job in Buffalo, Ny but I've got no where to stay, no money. I had a place to stay with a girl bit that didn't work out, she was really only interested in sex and when that came apparent I wasn't okay with it.

She said I wasn't contributing to any thing, right after I spent all of my food stamps on her cabinets, I gave her every thing I could and it still wasn't enough, she wanted to control me, she wanted to change me completely, I left and haven't looked back.

I have a full time job, a dog that if it came down to it I would rather live on the streets than give up, he's my best friend, he.s the only one so far that hasn't given up on me, if I gave up on him I'd be giving up on my principals and would have nothing to live for.

While being in the hospital he was faced with low platelets and blood cell counts and the feeling of unknowing. His illness eventually went in remission. During this time he married his beautiful wife and moved to Tampa to obtain his degree in medicine. All the while doing stand-up comedy and being the loveable Dick that he is. Up until about a month ago everything was fine, until he realized he relapsed.

Upon arriving at the hospital he was diagnosed with Myelodysplastic syndrome. His bone marrow began creating cancerous cells that needed to be destroyed. So they began chemo. Everything went well besides a few reactions, but in the end the chemo successfully killed off all the cancerous cells. Now it’s time that he receives a bone marrow transplant. It’s expected to take place sometime in July. If everything is successful he can go back to living his life free of medication and worry. Hopefully in time to go to Halloween Horror Nights 23 to continue the tradition.

I picked up a simple 16GB USB thumb drive from the store and headed over to her apartment in the afternoon.  As soon as I sat down at her desk and checked out her computer I knew it was in bad shape.  It was at least 8 years old, and it was literally limping.  It had no more space for a RAM upgrade, and it was already churning at 20MB over the available memory with no programs running.  Her hard drive was only 30GB and even after uninstalling everything she didn't need and transferring documents over to the flash drive I bought for her, she still only had a little over 100MB left of free space.

While helping her out, we were catching up on our lives.  I learned her husband passed away recently so she was living alone.  She said she had to sell her home because of it, and now she was living in that tiny apartment.  I looked around and it was clear she had very little to live on.  She was still teaching, but it was only a part-time job, so of course when I told her she should get a new computer it was out of the question.  Her computer played a major role in her teaching materials.  She was still using floppy disks and CDs.

I felt so bad for her.  She was one of the best teachers I've had, and knowing that she is still teaching now, it is evident that that is all she knows.  So I would really like to help her out with getting her a new PC,  but I don't get paid much myself so it's hard for me to afford new parts for her.  I planned out a simple build for her new computer here http://imgur.com/QvdvZPv

As you can see it is a very simple PC, just enough to get her up and running at full speed again for a good few years.  She only uses her computer for web browsing, email, and word processing (and clip arts).  I was also surprised at how clean her computer was.  She had no malware of any kind, and for a person that knows very little about computers, it amazed me, considering all the people I deal with at my job everyday whose computers were completely filled with crazy malware.

Of course money is an issue here, so this is why I am here.  If anyone can help out with this in any way, I would greatly appreciate it.  Even a part you may have that you don't need anymore would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

One of, if not the, most impressive charities I have ever seen.  rollingjubilee.org buys random people's debt for about 5% of its dollar amount and simply tears it up.

Banks that own your debt are generally happy to receive the much smaller but guaranteed money from a debt collector who then seeks to be compensated by the debtor.  But in this case, Rolling Jubilee does not seek reimbursement.  Here is an email I just got from them [tl;dr at bottom]:

The Rolling Jubilee is near $500,000 of donations.

Letters have been mailed to dozens of debtors.

Make a gift of debt liberation, using our holiday cards.

Start planning for January 21st, a national day of debt organizing.


But first... Thank You.

You have made the Rolling Jubilee a success of unimagined proportions.

It’s been just over one month since the People’s Bailout telethon.  Can you believe it?  Relive the magic by watching clips here.

Since that incredible night, we have been overwhelmed with scores of personal stories, hundreds of offers to help, thousands of emails and, of course, over ten thousand individual donations.  These donations - averaging just over $40 apiece - now total nearly $500,000, or ten times our initial goal.

Every donation will be used to help relieve someone’s debt burden, while shining much-needed light on the predatory debt system.

 

We have already begun to purchase debt. 

On Monday November 12, we purchased $100,145.74 of medical debt for $5,000.  Documentation of this purchase is available on our blog.  Thanks to donors like yourself, we are able to expose the vulture-like nature of debt collectors, and show just how little your debt is worth to the banks and lenders who sell it off in bundles at pennies on the dollar.

Earlier this week, we sent letters to the 44 debtors whose debts have been abolished so far.  Read Nick Pinto’s Village Voice story covering our mailing.

 

Rolling Jubilee Holiday Cards: Give debt abolition for the holidays this year!

You can choose one of three illustrated cards to give the gift of debt liberation!  Go to http://rollingjubilee.org/gifts/ and generate a personalized holiday card for printing or emailing. These cards are another way you can work to build a social movement against the predatory debt system. Together, we will keep the Jubilee rolling.

Art for the Rolling Jubilee holiday cards was graciously donated by Tim Paul, Corinne Reid, Kyle Smart, and Marc Scheff.

 

Next steps, and how you can help.

Strike Debt will host visioning session on debt on January 21st, MLK Day. There will be coordinated events in cities around the country. Keep your eyes on www.strikedebt.org, as well as Facebook and Twitter, for further announcements about this historic gathering.

Our primary focus over the next few months will be to deeply target the role of debt in our broken healthcare system. We will announce a substantial debt buy - made possible by your generosity - in concert with the release of in-depth report on medical debt that will follow the model of our report on the debt crisis emerging from Hurricane Sandy.  The strike of the Rolling Jubilee and the public service document on the healthcare system, aims, like all Strike Debt actions, to educate, create paths for direct action and mutual aid.  When we attack the current system, we build alternatives in its place.

Are you starting a local Strike Debt chapter? Great! We’d love to hear about it.  We’re building a directory of chapters around the world.  To get involved in the organizing, send a brief email to organize@strikedebt.org with your contact info, website, and anything else you would like to share with the Strike Debt organizing team.

Again, thank you for leading the way to a world where the debts we owe are to each other and not to the 1%.

Wishing you a very Happy New Year,

Strike Debt

I met the girl of my dreams online, we fell crazy in love, we met in Toronto, to see her favourite DJ play, I asked her to marry me, crazy fireworks, we went out to Vancouver together, I asked her to marry me properly, we got married, her kids like me, but...

She had been living with her abusive ex, I got severe tonsillitis, went to the ER, got into all kinds of trouble with my travel insurance, borrowed a crazy amount of money from family, in preparation for the marriage I forgot my passport in her purse, couldn't fly back with the flight my travel insurance had arranged for and they got into a severe fight that same day; promptly having her and the boys move in with me in the hotel.

Right now, I borrowed the last money I could from my awesome mom, who's actually been supporting me through all of this, but we need to check out of the hotel in the morning as I'm now really at rock bottom.

As her youngest doesn't have a passport, we can't just all go to The Netherlands, but we can get her boys to safety with family in Ottawa. That leaves for her and me... As much as I would've liked to stay in Vancouver, I don't have a Work Permit, so I can't work here, but I can in Holland!

I wasn't asking for anything, I just wanted to share my story and answer any questions people might have.

* [Baaabydoll](http://www.reddit.com/user/Baaabydoll) and [taxmeplease](http://www.reddit.com/user/taxmeplease), who took me out for coffee and conversation, made me feel like a human again, and taxmeplease gave me an incredibly warm sweater which really helped.   
* [azazelthegoat](http://www.reddit.com/user/azazelthegoat), who absolutely floored me with his care package.

I still need to follow up with a few of you. This is a huge help though, I'm finding most of these places hire from within, or with recommendations.

I've been applying for jobs for a good few weeks, but due to living in a heavily occupied student area its proven very difficult. I myself am also a student, but I've basically been snookered when it comes to getting a job in the nearby future.

My mac is currently on sale on ebay, as its the only possession i own of any real value, however the bidding wont be done until Sunday, plus the added 2-3 days for me to receive my money from paypal.
Im hoping to get at least £600-£700 for the mac itself, as its only a few months old, but any sum will be helpful.

My plea, and i hate to use the word, is if there is someone who would be willing to offer any advice to how i can maybe eat for free somewhere or even order me a pizza, all expenses will be paid back once my mac has sold of course. Anything is appreciated and welcomed.
I realize I'm a new user, and this topic might be taboo, but I have nowhere else to turn right now.

Need $300 more (asking in $10 or $20 increments) to get home from Macungie, PA",josephrooks,43,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1k8v4c/cornered_handcuffed_stranded_in_pennsylvania_need/,"Help is something I very rarely ask for. I've asked some friends, but I also wanted to ask you Redditors because I know how helpful you can be in a pinch.

I'm asking for help now because I've got more than just myself to look out for, and I don't see any other way around the situation I've been put in over the last few hours. I'll explain in bullet points because it's easier to process it that way:

* I'm currently sitting in a grocery store café that's open 24 hours because it's the only place nearby that I can get to.

* Earlier today, I was cornered by my girlfriend's parents in their house while they insulted me and attempted to provoke me into doing god knows what.

* At one point her mother even accused me of _killing my own mother_ to try to provoke me.

* I told them to get out of my way so I could leave the room, and when they refused I attempted to push my way around them to get out.

* They both forcibly pushed me back into the room, and used my pushing them to try to remove myself from the conflict as an opportunity to call the police and tell them that I assaulted them.

* I spent about half an hour in handcuffs (I wasn't arrested, but they did this for safety reasons based on what the parents told them) explaining what happened to the state police officers who showed up. 

* After that was over, I left the house. I won't be going back to it. I'm currently sitting in the Panera down the street figuring out what to do next.

* If I don't find somewhere to stay, I'll hang out in a 24-hour café nearby until I figure out what's next.

* We need to come up with about $500 to get home to Atlanta. This will be used to cover the expenses of one of my friends driving up here, taking us and our things back to Atlanta, and driving home.

* I'm asking everyone who can lend me $10 or $20 toward that goal to please do so. We have checks going to our address in Atlanta to pay everyone back with. But if we can't get home, we can't cash them.

## More Background Information

* It was my girlfriend's parents’ idea for us to come up here and stay with them while we decide if we're going to stay in Atlanta or move somewhere else.

* They voluntarily rented a car, drove down here, helped us pack our things, and drove us up to Pennsylvania for what we thought would be a short visit.

* Since getting here they've repeatedly told us one thing and then done another, making various arrangements related to taking us home to Atlanta and then pulling them out from under us while they berate us for causing problems for *them*.

* I've missed out on two interviews with creative agencies in Atlanta because of their lying about what they were going to do.

* My girlfriend almost lost her job because of this, but she was able to make arrangements to work remotely after explaining the situation to her boss.

* The lease in our apartment is up in a month, and we need to find another one to move into — which we haven't been able to do, because we haven't been there.

* I also posted this on my website (http://josephrooks.com/please-help) so I could send it to friends without having to explain every detail from memory over and over again. I have a PayPal button set up there, but you can PM me for information or to get more details.

My parents have never had much money, but over all things they prioritized putting all of their kids through religious private schools through their lives. It's cost them a lot and, regardless of anyone's religious views, has given us a very good education and well-being. This has, however, strained their finances for years, they worry about the electricity and phone cutting off all the time, but financial aid programs along with the help of the schools' administrations have let my parents do what they believe is best for their children.

My dad went into business for himself over 4 years ago and it's gone sour. He's also fallen behind on filing taxes because he didn't know how to handle all of the complicated forms that come with owning a business, and didn't know much about what he was doing. They are currently working very hard on catching up and aren't trying to evade taxes at all. And due to the low income and high number of dependents (5 children), they owe only a small amount.

But as you know, financial aid needs this tax information to determine how much aid you need. The K-8th grade private school has been gracious enough to give us huge tuition breaks regardless, because they personally understand how low our income is. And for the past 4 years, the private college-prep high school has worked with us as well. They've seemed to understand my parents' value of religious education and because it's a private school, they have more free reign over how they do these kinds of financial deals. Also, this school only opened in 2008. I came as a sophomore and my sister a freshman, and a lot of the school's vigor came from its newness and readiness to establish traditions and whatnot, blah blah blah.

Now, my sister (who we'll name Laura) has truly taken full advantage of everything the school had to offer. She excels academically, has been a part of sports teams from their start and is often in local newspapers for athletic excellence. She's been a school ambassador all four years (an ambassador is a student who does extra work in promoting the school, such as guiding tours, writing articles and pamphlets, sending cards and mail to potential new students, organizing and working open houses, the works) and is one of the true faces of the school. Point is, she's always been promoting the school and helping it grow.

**But now they're basically stabbing her in the back.** A few weeks before final exams, my parents received a letter from the principal (who is a Dominican sister [think nun]), giving her an ultimatum: My parents had to either pay $3900 before May 14, or Laura is disallowed from taking her final exams and is disallowed from getting her diploma. This will either render her grades incomplete or much lower than she deserves, and will prevent her from going to college next semester, because my parents cannot pay a lump sum after *already* working out a steady payment plan.

**edit: My biggest concern is for her final exams. I understand that money is owed, fair and square, but I don't see why it's necessary to forbid her from taking her exams. Can't they just withhold her diploma or credits? It doesn't make sense to ruin her actual class grades as well. If she can't as for her diploma, she at least deserves her final exams.**

Now, I know that tuition is mandatory for private school. My parents aren't trying to weasel out of that responsibility. But this attack is incredibly impersonal, given the personal relationship my parents have fostered with the administration in their time of need. I know many of you will criticize their choice of private school without the means to pay, but I've already explained their priorities and comments like that won't help. They won't send their children to public school, no matter what. But this decision is taking it out on the wrong person. The only person they're harming is Laura, their star-student, the student who proves much more worthy of these tuition breaks than I was. It's also sabotaging her transcript, as a transcript is supposed to be an example of someone's academic performance, and nothing else. If Laura makes bad grades or incomplete grades as a result of a *financial* issue through no fault of her own, it would be unjust and misleading to make it affect the hard work she's put in her grades these years.

I don't understand why they feel the need to make her grades fall as an insult to not letting her graduate.

Not to mention how *incredibly* un-Christian this is. It makes me sick to see them sign their letters ""In Christ"" as they attack a child for her parents' hardships. They have a choice in the matter. This is a private school.

**What can my parents do? What are your opinions? How can I ruin this school's public image if they ruin my sister's graduation?**

Oh, also since I'm seeing it in red on the submission page, this all takes place in Virginia.

Now a single mom with a baby and no hope :(,MomofToddler02,42,4,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ojkvv/need_advice_in_a_complete_hole_since_leaving/,"Hi everyone. I'm using a throwaway account because I am so embarrassed of my situation. I need assistance, in the form of advice. (Not sure if this is the best place for it? Let me know if not). I'm ALWAYS the one helping others. I never ask for advice, but I desperately need it. Here goes the story... First of all I live in MA. I was married for a year and recently had a child. My husband who was verbally abusive at the beginning of the marriage became physically abusive. I was a full time stay at home mom, my husband was working full time and despite knowing I would have literally NOTHING I couldn't stand the thought of my child growing up in an abusive household. One night I took off with my baby, filed for a restraining order and started divorce proceedings the following week. The problem is I have NOTHING in terms of money, personal belongings, or family (which is the hardest). My father lives an hour away but is letting us stay in his other home for only $300 a month (thank god). That is my only family member I'm in contact with (my mother is mentally ill and suffers from substance abuse). The problem is I am basically stranded, as I have no car. I am in my house with my young child 24/7. I don't know what to do. I live in a teeny tiny town with no public transportation. I am on food stamps and thankfully there is a grocery store a mile away I walk to each week. I do not qualify for welfare as the amount of money I get per week for child support ($150) pushes us over the limit. I am going into a MAJOR depression. I can't even put my child in school because I have no way to get there. I want to go back to school myself, but again no car. I cannot get a job because I don't have a car and I don't have a ride anywhere. The small amount of money I get per week goes to household expenses, childcare expenses and provides me with no way to get myself out of this hole I'm in and save for a car.  I feel like I am going crazy and feel so horrible for my child. I find myself longingly looking back at my ""old"" life with my husband just for the fact I was able to get around in his car, take my child to the playground every day and just get out of the house despite the abuse. Does ANYONE have ANY advice? I feel as if I have explored all options. I’m getting the point of feeling hopeless. I wish I had a support system of family and friends but I don't. I really hope to get some positive input, or any suggestions for a plan I could start to change my life. Thank you so much in advance, I can't begin to explain how grateful I am for anyone who took the time to read this! For the first time in my life I feel like such a Debbie-Downer.

Just over a year ago I was raped, and it wasn't very long before I started having flashbacks, panic attacks, and nightmares. It ruined my life. I went from being a hard-working young woman, with excellent grades and lots of friends to a depressed, broke, anxiety-ridden, anorexic wretch who is too afraid to go to her own mailbox. I was a virgin when it happened and part of me hates myself for having saved myself for 'the one' when all it meant in the end was that this creep had more to take away from me. I was putting myself through college at the time and doing so well at university that I even had an essay published in a medical journal while I was an undergrad. I've always been self-sufficient and have lived within my means. I've tried really hard to keep it all together, but my grades slipped (I even failed a paper for the first time, and now I'm on academic probation) and I'm struggling to pay bills.

What I really want is to get my life back. I've already started work on getting my grades back up to my old average, I've made some new friends (the old ones complained that I was too sad for them to hang out with anymore), and I managed to find a good apartment for me to share with 5 others for just $85 per week each although I'm going to struggle to come up with that much each week. I want to finally get some counselling for what happened as I really think I need it, but I can't afford it. I can't afford health insurance, and even if I could I have a pre-existing condition that would make me ineligible. I'm able to afford the fees for visits to my family doctor and for the medicine I am prescribed for depression, anxiety, and chronic insomnia. 

I've tried going to rape crisis and another sexual abuse help organization, but nothing ever came from it. I am on the waiting lists for 3 different community based counselling programmes, and have been so for at least 6 months each. I tried getting counselling through student health, but was told that it wouldn't be ""appropriate"" since none of the staff were specifically trained to deal with sexual assault victims. I have never felt more like a leper in my whole life. 

I went to the police, of course, but they said it was just his word against mine and dropped the case. I tried legal aid, but they said they couldn't help me. I tried the community advice bureau, but they said they couldn't help me. Same for the students' welfare executive and the disciplinary office at my school (he was a student too). The disciplinary office said they couldn't even start and investigation or even take his name down for future reference without him first being convicted of rape. Since the school's code of conduct means that a student can get exlpelled simply for having an open beer on the campus, you can imagine how shocked I was by the university's response. 

I finally found out that ACC (accident compensation corporation) offered a limited number of free counseling sessions for rape victims. However, 6 months later I haven't had any counselling yet, but have had to pay $110 for an appointment I missed because I was literally too ill to leave the house. 

I'm so tired of doing it all on my own, and a lot of the time I think it would have been better if he had killed me when it was over instead of letting me go. I really think that getting counselling and going back to university this year are the things that I need to do to get my life back, but it seems like everything I do to try to help myself ends up back-firing and making things worse. I'm so tired all the time, and I struggle to remember a time when I wasn't sad. I feel so trapped and I don't know what to do to make things better.

**TL;DR I'm 22 year old rape victim struggling to get back on her feet after the trauma and struggling to get counselling and pay bills.**

I have honestly been debating back and forth on posting this and asking for help. Up until very recently I haven’t experienced very many kind people in my life *other than close family and friends*. However, things are getting harder, fast. 

First a few things about me. I am a stay at home father of 2. My wife has a full time job and we have about $300.00 a week for bills/food/amenities. We live paycheck to paycheck and have nothing saved up at all. Recently we found out our food benefits have been cut rather drastically due to what we can only assume are state wide cutbacks. The cut was nearly 6 months ago now and we have slowly but surely been sinking into debt. We each have a $300.00 credit card *each one is within 50$ of max* that were used when our vehicle broke down nearly a year ago…. 

It would seem that same issue has hit again. Our vehicle now has a 1: blown head gasket, or 2: a cracked head. Either job will cost in excess of $1,500.00 to fix. However, my brother *being the awesome bro he is* has set out to find parts for my vehicle at the best price. He has also found a mechanic that can do it for an exceptionally low price. 

So far he has found an engine head (tested) for $45.00. However, the mechanic looked at our vehicle and said that because of the constant overheating and cooling down we have done irreparable damage to the pistons. This was a no option thing as it is the only mode of transportation we have. It's really odd, most times the thermostat *which is brand new* will open and it's fine, but when the exhaust gas is too much the thermostat can't open and the engine overheats. Thus, we need a new engine…….. SO, my brother set out once again (unknown to me) and found an entire engine for $450.00. (make, model, year, matched it all) The mechanic said he can do the entire swap for $300.00. 

My wife and I have ZERO saved up right now and will be lucky to pay rent tomorrow (my mother has offered to help us :D). So, I come to you. I have seen some incredible things on this site. I have even experienced some of it already. (a winter coat that is on it’s way to my house as you read this). Sadly, I just have nowhere else to turn. I have exhausted the local financial aid options, missing the DHS office’s vehicle help program by 2 months.

My brother and my mother said they will do everything they can to help. But there is just no way we can make it on our own.  Normally it would just be a hassle that would cause my wife to use the bus to get back and forth from work. However, her hours (which are set in stone because of her position) are outside of the bus’s transit hours. Thus, without this vehicle she will lose her job and we will be completely under. 

For ANYONE willing to help, if you have ANY questions about anything I have said here or if you want some kind of proof or anything. Please, don’t hesitate to ask. I don’t know how to set up charity funds or whatnot threw paypal, but we do have a paypal account that we use regularly. The email for that is Megami619@yahoo.com . That address is our paypal account that can accept most forms of transfers. *not sure how many different options there are.*
If you’re still reading, thank you. Any help we receive from you will be a god send in a time when we are in a very very bad spot. 

ALSO: Please, if you have any ideas on how we can go about this entire thing or things I can do to help raise $ for this, I welcome those ideas. I’ve just recently started talking with someone about making money at home. However, so far those things don’t seem to kick in until it will be too late. I will still be pursuing those options myself but for now we need to get out of this hole. 

**UPDATE 3** Because of 5 awesome and incredible redditors we have already received $205.00. In all we will need $450.00. Nearly half way there. I will be keeping it all in the paypal account until it is absolutely needed.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/jAq1C.jpg) is a pic so you can see it with your own eyes. :D. I have blanked out the names of those who have donated as this is personal information that I would rather not list publicly. If they wish their names be known they need only ask :D.

I set up a sub domain, and will later set up the actual domain to do some cool side stuff for assistance, although of course the main assistance site will always be here on reddit...:)

You do not have to use this tool, it is there as a tool for givers to use as another way of avoiding scams.

If you go to http://verify.redditassistance.info you will see the assistance tool.  I will link it to the sidebar shortly.

When someone in need is sent to the verification tool they enter their email address.
.. 

The person in need then sends the code they got to the person offering help. The person helping then goes to the site, clicks the check a code button, and sees how many time the system logged the person getting a code. The only other info the giver sees is the email address of the person receiving. 



Obviously, the only way this works is if the person is asked to use the tool when they receive, and there is not a way to backtrack to put in past people.

Edit: I wanted to mention that I know this is not foolproof, but it is a damn good deterrent, and takes some work to get around. A lot of people lack the know-how to get around it.

(She's stuck in a nursing home, suffering from Alzheimer's/dementia.)",hughfurey,43,9,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/gnox0/could_anyone_spare_a_card_for_my_grandmother_im/,"Hey Reddit, I got this message this morning from my aunt who takes care of my grandmother and I thought it would be something you guys could help me out with. I feel so powerless to help someone I care so much about. Grandma (Billie Anne) is in a nursing home due to Alzheimer's and dementia, and she is very, very lonely there. It breaks my heart to be on the opposite coast and therefore unable to visit her. The last time I visited her, I could tell that she was incredibly frustrated by her mind's inability to keep up. (She's perfectly healthy otherwise.) She's the iconic ""sweetest grandmother in the world"" who loves kitties, shopping, playing piano, making chocolate pudding pies for me, and being surrounded by family and friends. It would personally mean so much to me if Reddit could shower her with love by sending her cards; it's the only thing I can think of that can show her how much I truly love her and cheer her up even when she's not lucid. Here is part of my aunt's message:

""She loves opening cards and letters. She reads the outside first and then opens it while talking about how exciting it is to get a letter or card. 

She's not all there anymore but certain things still remain in place. During the holidays especially at Christmas she received cards from women at [her local church]. She was so excited to have the cards to open and then she would read and reread the cards to me and to herself. She likes to stack the cards in a pile and then separate them one by one. She loves bright colors! 

Grandma doesn't get any visitors.( Neither do I! LOL! It gets VERY lonely here.) I send her a happy 99 cent card from Wal-Mart once a month when I can. I like to send 2 a month but have such very little money. 

She would love anything you send to her. She does say your name. When she is calling me [by her sister/my mom's name] she asks how are you and once she thought you were here. She wanted to know if you were going shopping for shoes!""

Please Reddit, help me cheer up my grandmother. I can't keep crying like this. I guess the proper protocol would be to PM me for the address if you'd like to send her a card. I'd sincerely appreciate it, and I know it would just make Grandma's day to all of a sudden have tons of cards to open and talk about.


Edit: I cannot express my sincerest gratitude to everyone who has offered to send Grandma a card. She's even going to get flowers! I can't wait to hear back from my aunt on my grandmother's reaction to all of your kindness. I didn't realize that so many people had similar stories about grandparents suffering from Alzheimer's, and it's helping me to know I am not alone in this. You are all amazing, and I thank you.

Edit #2: My grandma loved the flowers! http://i.imgur.com/CxjXN.jpg
My aunt said ""She is very excited! She touched each color and smelled each one! She said, 'someone loves me, and you, [my aunt's name]'."" I'm so touched that someone serving in Afghanistan right now would do this for her. Thank you so so very much!

Just want to start out by saying I really love what you guys are doing here, it's a wonderful thing and you people are amazing. 

Anyways, let me tell you guys my story. 

    My on and off girlfriend since 2011 recently started seeing each other again back in September of 2012. We both realized that our feelings for each other never went away and we started dating again. And of course with the dating comes the sex. I admit, we weren't very religious with our use of protection, especially in November. She was on birth control though and we figured nothing would occur. Well come December around Christmas time, she became aware that she hasn't gotten her period for a long time and was experiencing all the pregnancy symptoms. I told her not to worry, I'm not going anywhere, and to abstain from any marijuana or alcohol until I managed to get her a test. 
    Fastforward January 2nd, the test reads positive. She freaks out but I managed to calm her down and assure her I'm her to support both of us no matter what. Things have began to decay between us though, she's treating me progressively worse everyday, spreading rumors about me poking holes in the condom(never used one) to get her pregnant on purpose and constantly threatening me with not letting me be apart of my child's life. I know some kind of issues have to be going on with her mentally but it's too late to go back on that. I've been paying all her medical expenses, phone bill, and gas. Anything she needs help with. I'm also currently unemployed but I've applied to several places. Thing is for now, I'm drained financially. I'm currently staying with a buddy of mine in his apartment but he also isn't financially stable. I've got a phone but the service runs out in two days and idk how I'm gonna get the money to pay it. My only reference number for the jobs to call back(I've applied to Fred's, dollar general, Walmart, and tractor supply) is my cell phone. I really can't ask my best friend whose already kindly let me stay with him till I manage to get my own place for money. But everything's getting so hard already. I'm worried that if me and my girlfriend don't work things out, this will turn into a custody battle after our baby is born. And emotionally, physically, and financially I'm in no way ready for that. we actually got the first ultrasound done yesterday and when i heard my baby's heartbeat and saw his/her little body for the first time i broke down in a flurry of emotions. Ive never felt a more beautiful feeling in my life. We also found out the due date will be august 15th, which seems really close even though its months away. I know, I try to be the perfect boyfriend for her and want to be the perfect father for our child. I really want to be that above all else. I want to spend the rest of my life providing for my kid, watching him/her grow, teaching them not to repeat my mistakes, and raising them with all the love and care they need.  

Can anyone please help me out with advice that's been through my situation? I'm completely lost, and if anyone would be kind enough to help me with my phone situation it would really mean the world for me. I'm not typically the person that asks for any handouts but I'm in need...and I sure could use help.

Please help.,anhtimmy,43,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/14qcda/my_kitten_fractured_her_femur_and_required/,"Dear /r/assistance,

Two days ago, my kitten Molly injured her leg. She was limping and crying so I immediately rushed her to a nearby emergency clinic where they took x-rays and confirmed that she had a fractured her left [femoral arch](http://imgur.com/MwW84). Because the facility couldn't perform the surgery, Molly was left overnight in the vet's care so she could be transferred to another facility that was capable of performing the surgery the next day.

[Here](http://imgur.com/4B13Z) we are two days ago at the emergency clinic waiting for the x-ray results.

[Here](http://imgur.com/ybnQw)
 is Molly the morning of the transfer, all drugged up but still feisty as ever. 


Yesterday, I met with the surgeon to discuss options for Molly and settled with [FHO surgery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femoral_head_ostectomy). Even with a student discount, the bill came out to be [$927.50](http://i.imgur.com/NGeBo.jpg?1). 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/AagdL) is Molly resting after the surgery.

Please help donate towards Molly's surgery. I am very desperate and would be forever grateful. 


Edit #1: Replaced the estimate bill with the final bill and corrected the price of the surgery.

Edit #2: CareCreditor has paid for Molly's surgery, but after everyone's concern, I am beginning to think this is a scam. He did exactly what backpackwayne and others have warned me about, but I didn't see it until it was too late. I have canceled the transaction via my bank, and will tell the vet to refund CareCreditor's money. I will keep everyone updated on this.

She is only 20, attending school (will have to repeat this semester), and is a super sweet, brave girl. Her boyfriend, Joseph, is wanting to surprise her with a trip to Hogwarts this summer, and when he is not 4 hours away from home, at the hospital, by her side, he is working around the clock to have the presentation of her gifts ready by the time she is ready to go home from the rehabilitation center (hopefully in 2 weeks). He has 36 hours to raise $800 dollars to have all of her gifts ready for her in time. Even just a dollar would help him reach his goal! I care very much about them both, and would love to see him reach his goal for her. It's been phenomenal seeing him put his project-designing skills to work on the website and the projects he is making to present to her. One option is to have your name added to the letter he is making. While this was originally designed with their friends in mind, he has been getting a few donations from strangers and I think has left the option at if you would like to have your name added or not. He wants a nice way to show her all the people who have cared and helped.

My name is Jesse. I recently moved to New York to get away from an abusive family situation. Since I've been here, I've been doing okay for myself, but as of the last few weeks, everything seems to be going downhill. I ended up getting a job while I was here, working third shift in a grocery store stocking shelves. It's important to note that I'm legally disabled, and that the only reason I got this job was because the expenses of moving ate away ALL my spare money besides what I needed for rent. Since I've been working, my food stamps ran out for the month. Because of this, I've become behind on my rent, due to having to spend cash on food. I live in a ""rooming"" house, where I share a kitchen and bathroom with 3 other people, but have my own room and pay rent weekly. As of yesterday, I lost my job. My income from disability has taken a huge hit for this month because of working for the past month, so I'm in an even more tight of a spot than I was when I first moved here. I was only able to pay half my rent for this week with my last paycheck from work. I get one check from social security this month, instead of two, and because of this, I'm gonna be a week short in my rent. I pay 130 a week. I'm currently $65 behind, but I'm gonna be another week behind soon, my landlord was already upset about only getting half, and I don't think he will be lenient about me being late or missing another week.  

 I hate to make it sound like a sob story, but it is what it is. If anyone could help me come up with the $195 I'm short, I would be eternally grateful. If any other information or proof is needed, I can provide it. Thanks for taking the time just to read this.

What should I do? Atlanta, Georgia",Valladian,47,13,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/xoulj/reddit_ive_been_sick_every_day_since_october_i/,"The history starts back in late September of last year. I started having breathing problems, then it got to where I was having severe cheat pain as well. I was a smoker so I figured it was related to that, but when I put down my pack for good I did not get better, I started to deteriorate even more. The pain was awful, like a burning and stabbing in my chest, it radiated all over my torso and the only time I got any relief was when I laid on my back. That's how I stayed, sorry to say, until around Jan of this year.

After two months I was in so much pain I couldn't sit up for more than a few seconds at a time. I couldn't game, watch a video, anything. I spent all day lying on my back and staring at the ceiling. I went to the hospital for the first time, no diagnosis, they just sent me home. I figured it was because I lacked insurance so I shopped around and found some I could afford. Still, they did a urine test and sent me home, completely ignored my other symptoms. I couldn't leave the house anymore, the pain was so bad I thought I'd collapse. I almost did a couple times, I'd find myself sitting down in the middle of the aisle at the grocery store.

I found a doctor who made house calls, it was cheap and I had to pay upfront but I needed treatment of some kind. He took my $200, gave me a basic examination, told me I had GERD. He then referred me to a GI doctor and a neurologist, specialists that wanted over $450 just for an appointment! He put me on Nexium, the most expensive PPI on the market,  and gave me some medication to help with my shaking. I was shaking uncontrollably, I was in so much pain I couldn't help it. I was at the point where I'd try anything, I was so sick no amount of money was too much for relief. I was spitting up blood by this point.

The Nexium was $200 a bottle, my insurance was gone because I couldn't afford to keep it so I paid full price. The acid pain got better, but after a month it wasn't doing a thing for the chest pain or my breathing, and I was still spitting up acid when I ate anything. I can't even drink water without spitting up. By Feb I had refilled 3 times and that on top of what I had paid for him to refill my RX I'd spent over 700 dollars on a cure that did nothing miraculous for me. I still couldn't work, or sit up, was in constant pain, spitting up blood daily now, and the bastard refused to refill my RX anymore. He said he gave me ample time to see a specialist like he said, but I could not possibly have afforded it. Now I was back to having acid pain as well on top of everything. I went to the hospital after spitting up very bright red blood, they admitted me this time, but not for what was wrong with me. 

On the way there the EMT checked my blood sugar, it was double a normal adults amount, and my heart was beating at around 160 times a minute. I got an oxygen mask, then dumped in an ER room for 3 hours before they even took an x-ray. When they admitted me they did so to monitor my heart, I was literally vomiting up blood but they were completely unconcerned about that. The GI doctor on staff is for ""emergencies only"" as they put it. This was my 4th trip to the hospital in 6 months, it was the only time they'd done anything more than check my blood oxygen and made me piss in a cup. I got an RX for a generic Omeprazole that I took up until a month and a half ago, I ran out and could not get a refill for it. Now I take the OTC alternative, literally half the dosage I was taking, and I'm getting sicker every day.

I'm going to lose my home due to back taxes, any day now I'll get a letter telling me I have x days to pay what I owe. I can't save a penny, my girlfriend supports us and she doesn't make enough for me to even see a doctor, let alone pay several thousand in taxes. I'll be out on the street soon and she'll go live with her mother, it upsets me so much I just want to cry, but if I did I would stop breathing because I can barely breath as it is. I can sit up for short periods of time, I've gotten used to the pain, but as soon as I eat or drink something it hurts so bad I want to die. As I stated before I can't ask you guys for medical advice, that's not what this sub is for. But I need to know what can I ultimately do at this point?

I've exhausted every resource I have, I have nothing of value I can sell, the house isn't even in my name yet and I'm about to lose it. I don't even own a car, though i couldn't drive one the way i feel every day. What should I do from here?

Found new permanent home for my motorhome, 66 miles away. Need help towing the broken RV there--otherwise I'll lose the RV.**

Was urged by potentialloser to post again. 

So, another update.

For more background, look [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/wnmwp/update_homeless_hearing_impaired_man_needs_help/)


Found a place about 21 miles east of Arlington, Washington, for my RV. Gorgeous area, the kind of place I've been dreaming of living in since I was a kid. Rent is $250 a month, with a $50 deposit to hold it. I went there yesterday and put a deposit on it. The place is *mine*! Yayy!

Now I just have to get the RV there.

Was quite an expedition getting there. My car's radiator is broken, so I can only drive it about 4 or 5 miles at a time, then I have to park it and let it cool down for an hour before driving it another 4 miles.

Drove 132 miles round trip that way. 16 hours each way just to get there, see the property, and put the deposit on it. I ended up being awake for 41 hours straight, doing that.  Spent most of yesterday sleeping, to recover from that.

I did not receive any help with repairs to the RV--it too has a broken radiator. It also has extremely weak brakes, a flat tire I can't swap out because the lug nuts are on so tight even a professional mechanic couldn't get them off. The engine also stalls under load.

I had several redditors promise me help with RV repairs months ago, even as long ago as a year back--but they didn't follow through enough. The repairs never got done. Instead I've been dealing with a lot of parking tickets, forced moves, and impounds, draining me of funds, and the needed time for repairs (can't really take the RV apart for repairs on the street when it has to be kept ready to drive at all times to minimize police problems).

I realized it's faster and cheaper to just tow the RV as it is to the new place, rather than try to fix it now. I can then do repairs there at leisure, as I have funds for it. And I won't have to move it again for years to come--heavenly!

It's a *big* motorhome though, 30 feet long, weighing 14,000 pounds, and I do not have funds to both pay the move-in costs on the new space and the RV tow. 

An ordinary tow truck that tows cars and pickups won't cut it for this big beast. I'll need a big tow truck that can tow large heavy vehicles the 66 miles to my new home--the first home I've had in 15 years. And pretty much the ONLY kind of home I can afford on my extremely low fixed income (SSDI, disability).

So I am looking for a tow truck driver who can do this job, maybe even at a large discount. And looking for help in funding the tow.

If we can do this, my time of homelessness is finally over, for the first time in 15 years. I'll have my dream place in the mountains, electricity, internet, stability. The police will finally be off my back, no more parking tickets, no more impounds, no more police harrassment. I can finally move forward with my life and focus on getting an online business started so I can supplement my income and get out of poverty. The predators will be *gone*.

If I *don't* get the motorhome towed to the new space (The move in date is August 4), the motorhome will be impounded. The owner of the temporary spot where I am now is getting antsy and wants me gone asap. He was really nice in letting me park next to his business but it's been 2 months now and he's losing patience. I don't blame him.

So I lose the motorhome if I don't get this moved to my new home on August 4.

I've posted to /r/Seattle before for local help but they downvote me to  oblivion. Mean folks in there. 

Not really asking for money--just need a tow. Some how, some way.

Calimhero in r/ suicidewatch is going to take collections to help this guy. Of course what he really needs is a job. He will take most anything so anyone out there in Michigan that has something to offer it would be greatly appreciated.

In the meantime he needs to eat and stay warm. I'm going to start the fund off with a $50 donation. If any of you would like to donate, you can contact [Calimhero](http://www.reddit.com/user/Calimhero) the moderator over in suicidewatch to ask any verification questions you might have and for a paypal account.

She's coming home.**

**My thanks to any and all people here who donated, your kindness is *very* much appreciated.**

My friend Rachel Horlings and I were in school at Florida State University together. I actually had her as a student in the first class I TAed when I was a new graduate student and she was still an undergrad, and she was a riot. But scary smart as well. We hung out with the same crowd of underwater archaeologists, and she was always one of the most generous and kindest people. Totally non-judgmental, accepting of other people.

She was an underwater archaeologist interested in the African side of the slave trade (she was of European descent, but was born and grew up in Nigeria). She finished her master's degree several years ago, went on for her Ph.D. and finished that, and was continuing to work on her research interests with periodic trips to the west coast of Africa (Ghana, Nigeria).

She traveled there early in March to start some research, and her parents joined her there for a visit. As she was setting up her computer and printer in her hotel room (according to her father) she experienced several small shocks, but didn't give it a significant amount of thought. Who thinks about the possibility of being electrocuted? It's one of those modern dangers that we simply don't consider anymore.

Later, as she reached to unplug the USB cable from her printer, she received a full shock, cried out, ""I can't let go!"" and by the time her father had pulled the cable free she had collapsed. She was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.
There are some awful things about the story that I can't share here regarding how her parents - particularly her father - were treated, but the upshot is that her parents cannot afford to bring her body home to the US because the cost of getting it released and brought back is upwards of $20,000.

If anyone reading this is at all moved to donate a dollar or two or ten to help her family bring her back, please visit the page I linked to. Read the stories her friends have posted about her if you wish, and please consider making a small donation.

My thanks to anyone who is willing to do this.

**EDIT: If you have concerns or questions about this, please do not post on the website, direct them to me either via this thread or via PM. It has only been a week since this happened, her family has been through (and is still going through) hell, and they don't deserve to be treated poorly about this. I posted this here because I wanted to help them, but they had nothing to do with this. Please consider their loss before you lash out.**

I'm really not the kind of person to ask for favours as i'm a huge socially awkward penguin in most situations. Even fearing posting this because of possible comment rejection?

Anyways here goes.

My girlfriend and her Mom have been working day and night to get there hand made jewelery business going. They created it in loving memory of their sister/daughter Rachel that passed away unexpectedly 5 years ago. They opened up shop 7 days ago at www.etsy.com/shop/LehcarGallery (Lehcar is Rachel backwards)
The quality of their work is great.

The problem is they have had zero sales. Everytime i come home from work(the 3 of us live together because it is expensive where we live. Victoria BC) i can tell they havent sold anything just by the look on their faces and it breaks my heart. 


Here's the favour...

If anyone could purchase just one small item from their shop you would make 2 women that dont smile very much, smile for weeks.

Thanks for reading. Now to try and stop my hands from shaking! Lol


EDIT: You guys are awesome. I got home from work and my GF shouted ""WE SOLD SOMETHING"" 
They had 2 sales. It's made their week!
Now the question is, do I tell them where it came from or do i just keep this post as my little secret?

EDIT 2: I'm taking notes on everything everyone suggests in this thread. I'm going to drop a suggestion on them every couple days so they don't think anything is up! They have noticed the traffic from reddit on their etsy stats but they have no idea what this site is, so we are good! Today I suggested Twitter which they though was only for celebrities.

I'm 99% sure that my company is covering up a PCB spill.  The PCB spill came in contact with food, a water supply, and other humans.  The PCB test of the oil came back above legal limits.  I've checked the reporting website and it doesn't seem to indicate that anything was ever reported in the area.

If your not familiar with PCB's you can read here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychlorinated_biphenyl


Basically it can make you super super sick, if not kill you.  Its been linked to cancer, and other extremely serious conditions.

If I blow a whistle here the company would go under no questions asked.  The fines would easily be into the billions of dollars.  Would I be in lot of trouble?  Would my career in this field be screwed?  I'm at a loss here this is an EXTREMELY dangerous situation that I feel obligated to report yet I don't know what to do.  Would i be screwing myself too?  Hope someone can help.

Edit:  so to clarify some things.  First I absolutely believe I have an obligation to say something I'm not questioning that.  I'm trying to find clarification on whats going to happen if I do say something.  (perhaps using the links listed below)  The other thing too even though its been linked to cancer and lots of other problems the limit is currently measured in parts per million.  PCB's are for the most part non existent but the nature of the beast is serious.  I'm more concerned that my company is breaking the law then I am of any true/serious consequences coming from the spill (IE people dieing, of course though because this could happen I've got the obligation to say something)

Though I'm still wondering if anyone has any insight into will my career be screwed (labeled as a whistle blower) Could I get in any trouble legally? Assuming some how we'd know everyone would be unharmed from the spill do you think its worth someones career to hold a company liable/responsible?",,False,,t5_2s25d,True,,,True,t3_i4whk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/i4whk/i_never_thought_id_be_the_whistle_blower/,

My family was overwhelmed by your generosity, and as a result my aunt has become more comfortable with being forthcoming to the rest of the family about my grandmother's needs. As for myself, all the little notes of encouragement and understanding that you wonderful people sent my way remind me that I do not hurt over this alone. That, and Raising Hope reruns, reminds me that my grandmother would want me to find the humor in her madness, rather than tearing up at every thought of her losing her mind. Besides, I heard that the other day, she had a group of patients out in the courtyard singing ""Old MacDonald,"" only instead of calling out animals, she called out that ""on that farm, he had a jerk,"" and instead of referring to my grandfather by name, she says ""I call him a problem."" She is definitely a favorite among the staff for being so gentle and sweet, but tenacious nonetheless. I'm convinced that she messes with our heads for some level of lucid amusement, only we're too freaked out by her condition to tell, much less play along.

This is my very real, well-used Reddit account and I'm humiliated that this post might be seen by my buddies in other subs. My need is quite modest, so please read on.

 **THIS THREAD IS NOW CLOSED. DO NOT SEND ANYTHING ELSE!**

 I'm no longer unemployed (this is the good news). The bad news is that it came too late, and I do not even have the funds for gas, specific OSHA shoes, and a few acceptable dress shirts to get me through my first pay period. I was mostly ineligble for any meaningful unemployment because most of my income was in cash (I will never hide income, again after learning that lesson). I have maxed out my savings and my credit over four months of bills. I sold my prized laptop and some other valuables to make ends meet, and successfully applied for food stamps (a great program, btw...very little red tape and a life-saver). But even though I survived, I am literally stone broke. There are three dimes and a nickle next to the borrowed netbook I'm writing this on. 

 Allow me to grovel at the feet of Reddit's collective awesomeness: If you are able to help a guy with some fresh work clothes and gas (gas is priority, as I am not serviced by public transit) to get their for a few weeks, I'll probably cry from the good will. I start next Monday and honestly have no other options. Any 'donations' will be repaid within a couple of months. 

 As I gather is standard after reading some other threads, I will provide screen shots of my bank balance. I believe it's $0.82.nd the only reason that's there is because you can't buy anything for less than a dollar, heh. I will also answer any questions you might have and **include my phone#** if that puts you at ease. Please know that I am a real person taking a very real risk of humiliating myself, so this appeal truly is a last resort. 

 Even if this doesn't work, please allow me to express my sincere, fuzzy-hearted thanks that this sub even exists. I lost most of my faith in humanity just a short time after college and the fact that you folks even exist really means something to me. So even if you can't help financially, your well-wishes and other advice are much appreciated.

He had better hope I never meet him in an alley somewhere, I’m a little chick but this momma will make sure he losses a few teeth!). Rj’s leg was crushed and his foot was only attached by a few tendons. The docs are doing everything in their power to save his foot. He was in surgery a short time after the accident and we almost lost him while in surgery. He had to be revived twice. We almost lost an amazing boy that day. They did everything they could to put his leg ankle and foot back together, we are now hoping it worked. If not… his foot will be amputated. He is obviously going to be in the hospital, and then incapacitated for a Long while. This is where I am desperately hoping I can get a few people to help me to provide a little sunshine to a boy who needs a little kindness. This little man needs something to help keep him positive, occupied, connected. He also needs the ability to keep up with school work. Rj needs a laptop. Another big reason for this is that his father lives in Colorado while Rj in in Las Vegas. His father is unable to be with his son. He is on parole and wasn’t granted permission to go and be with him. Rj and his father are both absolutely crushed to be forced apart during this painful, stressful and terrifying time. We are hoping to minimize the distance between them with Skype. Maybe being able to video call his dad will help calm and comfort Rj. It would be unimaginable for me as a mom to be told I couldn’t be with my kiddo while he is in so much pain, and is so scared. Rj is a great kind, smart sweet funny, kiddo. He has been through so much in his short life but wont let the rough times wipe the grin off his face. I hope a few people reading this can find a few bucks to show Rj he is loved, and that he doesn’t have to spend the next few months bored, having only the pain, and fear of losing a limb to concentrate on. We have come up with as much money from family and friends as possible to get Rj a laptop and reconnect him with the world, and his dad. But we have come up short. If a few people could help with a few bucks we can get Rj a computer so he doesn’t go nuts while he is in hospital and then bed bound for the next few months. I was hoping for Best Buy gift cards. This way you can be sure the funds will Only go to getting Rj what he needs. I am more than happy to provide any proof requested to show that I am real, Rj is real and I am telling the complete truth. If you need proof just PM me and I will respond asap.

My first time posting and I desperately need help. My situation is pretty horrible. I am looking for a place to rent. I have been looking for the last 2 months. Up until yesterday, I had a place I was going to live until the landlord pulled some sneaky move on me. I gave this landlord $1400 as a holding security deposit and it would be applied as my security deposit if I moved in. This $1400 was half of all the money I had to my name. He guaranteed me that If I gave him the money he would rent to me when I was ready to move out on Feb. 1st. So now Im ready to move out and I go to talk to him and make sure its ready and he tells me he rented it to someone else who outbid me. Then he proceeded to tell me how he didn't have my money anymore and he spent it. I called the cops but it could take up to 2 months for me to get my money back because of court. I only have 3-5 days to move, and I only have $1400 as a deposit now, or I will be homeless. So basically what i am asking for is advice, help finding a rental i can get into by the first, if anyone is trying to lend me enough money that I could get me a place, or however you think you can help me.

In May, I moved out an apartment complex I had lived in for five years because they jacked the rent up to $2,500.  I moved into a fairly well known apartment complex in the area (if you're from Herndon, you'd know it) and had to pay a $2000 deposit with my first months rent.  Fine, I've got the money and knew I would have to.

The old complex took out rent for June (even though we were moved out) and caused the security deposit (not rent) to bounce.  I found about the mistake, got my parents to lend me the 2K until the old leasing office refunded my money. (6 weeks later!) and also paid an additional $300 legal fee to prevent me then from evicting us / taking us to court.  The account is all settled.

Flash forward to two months ago, I pull my credit report because I'm finally seeing a bunch of old debts that I paid off 7 years ago fall off - and I see this judgement from the new leasing office on there.  A judgement to evict us.  I'm confused - since I still live in the complex and my account has been current ever since.  I go to the leasing office and they are like, ""Oh, we have no idea how that got on there!  Sorry!""  and I ask them to take it off.  They say it will be taken off.  Flash forward to this month, still in the court system, I go back and say, ""Hey, what happened with this,"" and they say that once a judgement is entered there's no going back.

Nevermind the fact that it's an erroneous judgement since I paid within the 5 days of the notice (actually the day I got it) and I also paid the legal fees ($300) which was supposed to stop this from happening. 

I called the courts, and they basically told me I have to hire a lawyer to take the apartment complex to court to get it vacated.  However, I am not in a position right now where I want to pay a ton of money to get something vacated that should have not been on my record anyway, and I have no idea what kind of lawyers I need.

So, reddit, I ask you!  

1.  What kind of lawyer would I need
2.  Is there anyway I can get the complex to pay for the lawyer?
3.  Is this something I can do relatively easily myself?  And by easily, I mean, with not a lot of time commitment.  I'm a project manager and typically being in the courts without my phone is frowned upon since I can't read e-mails and would rather not burn vacation to handle something that should have never occurred in the first place.

You see, while I am broke, I have something that I have been working on for quite some time.  It is simple, yet can be difficult to build if you do not have the experience on how to build it, and I would like to help anyone who could use it.

What I have is an entirely automated excel document that can help in long term planning.  Currently my excel document forecasts the next year for my needs and resources, but it can be easily modified for your needs and resources.  I looked for a similar resource and could never find it.  Its rather simple, here is how it works.

First you put in how much money you have on hand. and your last pay date.
Next you put in how much money you make bi-weekly (but the rate of pay can be changed to however you want it)
Then you input the frequency in which you wish to set money aside for bills.  I am still climbing out of debt so the frequency I put money aside is when the bill is due, but if you are not in deep in debt I would suggest putting half of whats due on the prior check, and whats due on the current check.

Then you watch the magic.  It completely automates your payments, pay dates, total debt per pay period, and remaining balances.  It really helps you plan in the long term to see what the effects of for example even spending 10 dollers more in gas a week will do to your budget long term.

Additionally it is modified so that it can monitor activity in accounts based on initial value and current rate of payments.  This way you can see the long term affects of working hard and paying the debt at specific rates will result in.

I have made this spreadsheet off of experience of the difficulty of building a accurate budget, and feel that had I had this tool earlier I would not be in the debt I am in now.

**tl;dr I have a budget spread sheet that I would like to share with anyone that would like to utilize it.  I can teach you how to use it, and once you learn its REALLY easy to manipulate**

**Disclaimer:  I am NOT a financial adviser, nor should this service be interpreted as a professional financial advisement.  This is simply a tool that when used correctly can assist in long term planning.  This automated spreadsheet is only accurate as the information you put into it, and as accurate as you stick to it.  It is your responsibility to keep in mind the unexpected things that are NOT on the spreadsheet.  In taking this offer for a spreadsheet to assist you, you accept that you cannot and will not hold me liable for anything resulting from the use of the spread sheet.

1357830694.0,31,self.Assistance,16be5w,"So I'm jobless, home bound, taking care of my grandparents.  My father's bed bound with Alzheimers.. And I'm cornered by my siblings.",Crushtooth,35,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/16be5w/so_im_jobless_home_bound_taking_care_of_my/,"Here's a shot to hoping I do this right without breaking rules or coming off as a sorry sod.

I'm a twenty-two-year-old woman, unemployed and, as of current, housebound.  I'm taking care of my grandparents, who had adopted me, so now I refer to them as mother and father.

Father is on his deathbed.  He's a ninety-five-year-old veteran, and for the most part, he is blind and deaf.  Worse, he has alzheimers, and it is at a late stage.  His body is shutting down, and we are watching him die.

Since I still live with them, I do all the heavy stuff.  I pick him up, move him, clean him, change him.  I also fix things around the house, clean, move things, and in general, I do whatever needs to be done.

Mother, unfortunately, cannot do much right now.  She's fully recovered from a recent break in her shoulder and knee, but has been having troubles with her back and hip.  She's not capable of half of what she could do last year at this time.

We just got father back out of a nursing home, which was temporary while mother recovered from her broken bones.  We couldn't afford it.  It was over four-thousand a month, and that was the cheapest locally.  We were lost, we thought we were utterly screwed until he died.

The VA has finally decided to get around to pushing papers here and there, and gotten us lined up with hospice and a local elderly-aid organization.  But we still worry over what is to come.  Sure, it looks as though that problem has been given an answer, but all good things that have come to us have always bitten us in the ass when we weren't looking.

The rest of our family heavily disagrees with us on keeping him home.  They keep trying to force mother into accepting different plans, or straight out moving and selling our home, and kicking me out, to pay for his care in the nursing home.

Since they've been unable to budge her, and for good reason, as everything they've suggested would have left us both homeless in winter, of all great seasons, they've turned their hostility onto me.

They insult me, look down on me for being unemployed, and now, they're terminating my phone contract because I cannot pay for it myself, even though mother has asked to pay for it in my stead.  Did I use that word right?

The point is, they're trying to blackmail us with incredibly poor and stupid material, and all they're doing is hurting us.  Me in particular on this one; that phone has literally saved my life, and I've got dozen of job hunt applications on it that I actually use.

The problem is, I can't get a job if I'm home taking care of mom, dad and the house.  And if I neglect any of those three for a job, then they'll still take the damn thing away from me.

So I guess what I'm asking for here, more than anything, is suggestions, advice...  Pretty much over the following;

How to help my mother through this time.  She's watching her husband of almost fifty years die before her eyes.

How to tackle this problem with my siblings, snotty people that they are, and their constant disapproval and little attacks on us.

And should my phone be terminated, how should I keep it?  I know I can get a sim card from another service and insert it, but won't everything be lost?  I've never really looked into this.

And maybe someone has suggestions for a way I can get an income from home?  I don't think there are any from-home jobs open in the area that are within my qualifications, and sad as it is, I'm starting to think maybe I should try giving art another try and getting commissions from certain sites online.  Small income, but it might be worth it if I can do it in my spare time.

I don't know what I'm really asking.  I just wish that everything could be laid out, clean and simple, and sorted, and assigned proper answers.

Hope I didn't waste anyone's time.

I constantly job hunt and never get anything. I do what gigs I can and attempt to make whatever money I can. Thankfully, im able to get just a little to make it by. Im so grateful for what my friends have done for me but I can not keep relying on them like this. 

Reddit...what can I do? I tried so much. I can not find a job. I have little to nothing for myself and its depressing. I do my best to keep my chin up but in truth im miserable.

Hope this finds you well.  It has been a rough week for this animal-loving couple.  We live in New York City with our 2 Turkish Angora cats which my fiance' inherited from her father when he passed away.  

We recently moved into a cheaper building (things are so expensive here) that is on a high floor.  To our despair, one of the cats fell from our 8th story apartment on Sunday.  

As you can imagine, my fiance' is pretty torn up about all of this.  These, according to her, are her last bits of her dad.  So she's feeling incredibly sad and guilty that this happened, even though I tell her that it was just an accident.

Anyway, I just got a call from the animal hospital and he's doing much, much better.  His lungs were beaten up really badly from the fall and were leaking air.  So they had to do a chest tube and place him in an oxygen cage.  He's been getting this treatment non-stop since Sunday night and it appears to be working.

His appetite is back, in spite of some broken teeth.  He's purring like crazy.  And his fractured leg isn't bothering him (yay pain meds).  Unfortunately, he's still going to need to have surgery on his wrist.  

She'll do absolutely anything she can to get him back in good health, but that's most likely going to involve us putting $2-8K on a credit card, because we didn't have pet insurance and only about $4k in our ""pet fund.""

I know there are much, much more pressing needs out there than to donate to one cat's medical bills.  But I know there are other pet lovers out there that would love to donate a few bucks if it meant helping out such a sweet animal. Even if it was just a dollar or two, I'm sure it would help get him back to his old self.

I'm not sure how to go about verifying our claim here, but if you get with me via PM I can try to send pics of our cat in the ICU wing at NY's Animal Medical Center (62nd and York).

[Here are a couple of pics of our cat.](http://imgur.com/a/C1IW1)

Thanks to all for taking the time to read.  At the very least, please send your prayers/karma/whatever you believe in to my girlfriend.  She's just torn up over this and could use a little positive vibes her direction. 

Edit 1: have already gotten a couple of donations.  You guys are amazing.  My fiancé will be overwhelmed by your kindness.  Some people have PM'd suggesting I go ahead and post my paypal ID, so here it is: ocelot4ark@gmail.com (verified).  If you have Chase and would prefer to use quickpay, my ID on there is: jsnorris@ymail.com. Every last cent is extremely appreciated. 

Edit 2: We just got back from visiting him in the ICU again.  Thought you guys might be curious to see a pic.  He looks much better today - not nearly as doped up, as they've changed his pain meds.  [Here he is.](http://imgur.com/k8CkX)

Edit 3: The little guy is doing about the same today.  His vets think they might be able to take his chest tube out tomorrow.  They're going to re-do his xrays to check on his lungs and if they've recovered enough we might be able to bring him home over the weekend before having to take him back up there to save his leg.  Finally got at least SOME idea as to the costs of his recovery.  Initial estimate was $4k.  With the added findings, they're now thinking it'll be $9.5K.

I had the chance to tell him a story about how he helped me though a really rough spot in my life where I lost my dad and it was his podcasts (Specifically the Smodcast) that helped me laugh and let me get through some really bad spots in the intervening two weeks.

The best moment was taking Amtrak, numb and just trying not to think about my dad - if I did I had to go into the restroom and try and hold it together. But I listened to his Podcast, been a small time listener at that time for a long time, and I laughed. I damn near surprised myself that I still could.

From then on, when people would leave me to be, when arrangements were done, when everyone had gone to bed. I just started listening to them more and more. It gave me a smile, it gave me armor.

To make a long story short I told him this story and he came off stage and hugged me. Not a weak hug either, but a huge bear hug that I gave back. Imagine that? Two guys just hugging and crying in a theatre full of his fans and friends. Surreal.

The audience started cheering and I started crying (which I had been since I started getting really into the story) it was one of those moments that I was glad I spoke and told him that story. I got a chance to tell someone how much they changed my life, how much they helped me. It is something I wont forget.

My friend was supposed to take pictures, but she did not - said they were all blurry when she tried to take them (to far away.) So I have nothing; no pictures and no video. I know this is a long shot, quite a long one, but I was wondering if anyone could happen to have a photo or, amazingly enough, a video of that moment, it would be a great cap to an amazing event.

I can provide proof of who I am, but if you were there you should remember that evening and me.

She's been in the hospital for 6 months now and things aren't looking better.

The hospital is quite far from where we live so on some days no-one is keeping her company.

I was hoping maybe some redditors would mind sending her letters/get well cards? That way on the days no-one comes along, she'll at least have something to look at.

Unfortunately I'm not sure how long she'll be around for, so I'm trying to at least improve the quality of her situation for the time that she's here.

*EDIT* We did an ultrasound at a non-profit today, but they had no certified radiologist so those are being shipped out. However, the vet did see that his intestines are extremely inflamed. To the point that it is pushing his liver into other organs. From the vet's description, he says this would either be from Damien being poisoned or eating tons of bark (which has never happened nor is there bark in the yard for him to eat). Sadly, it is too late for toxicology tests to prove anything or carbon to absorb any toxins. They are out of his system and this is the bi-product.

The vet says he will be dead within a week on the liquid diet and massive diarrhea. We went and got more prescription meds, and actual prescription food. We are hoping we can get it in him. Depending on the results, they may still want a CT scan.They may also need to surgically remove a portion of dead intestines... we don't know yet.

I'm also in need of clothes. I need a couple pairs of khakis and a couple nice shirts. I've been looking at the donations but I can't find anything that fits me. 

I have no friends here and no one to ask for help. If there's anyone out there that's willing and able to help I'd be happy to verify and provide any additional information you need. I'm hopefully that I can get out of this situation, but right now things don't look good. Thanks for reading. 

Edit: thank you for the responses. I sent messages for those asking for info. My clothing size is XL shirts and 40x32 pants. Thank you all so much. ",,False,,t5_2s25d,1355231235.0,,,True,t3_14lzx1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/14lzx1/im_homeless_and_desperately_in_need_of_money/,

I have been robbed, albeit legally, by PNC Bank.",timd234,44,15,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1425xn/help_me_please_i_have_been_robbed_albeit_legally/,"I was going to post this under a throwaway, but fuck it, I don't see how things can get much worse...

For the past three or so years, at every job I have had, I have set up direct deposit pay, simply because it makes things easier (I have a bad habit of losing checks and other important things). Around that time, I won $100 from a scratch off lottery ticket, and instead of using it on fun irresponsible things like a 20 year old should, I opened a savings account, separate from my checking account, at a completely different bank. (PNC). At each job I ever got after that, I split my direct deposit up, 10 dollars going to my savings and the remainder to my checking (at an entirely different bank, I feel that is important to this story). I gave all the paperwork to my father and told him no matter how much I begged and pleaded, to not give me any info that would allow me access to said account for 2 years, and even though, only if I came to him in an absolute emergency. (I even went as far as to sign a direct deposit form, fax it to him, he would then put my savings account number in and then fax it to my employer). I was serious about this shit.

Its been three years since I opened that account, and I have fallen on quite, QUITE hard times. Electric bill shutoff notice (even though its winter and they can't legally do it, they still threaten every other day), phone bill past due, rent behind (we're not on a lease, so we're pretty fucked in that department), no food, no gas, checking account overdrawn, payday not for another week...what a perfect time to dip into the rainy day fund, right?

""LOL WUT?"" says PNC.

Turns out, they flagged my account for fraudulent activity. Why? TOO MANY DEPOSITS. I don't want to go into detail, but they mailed my parents address, where I no longer live, and they ignored them, thinking it was junk mail or whatever. Obviously I didn't respond. They closed the account, took my money (roughly $1500, not including interest), and here's the best part: until last week when I found this out, they were still accepting the deposits, but instead of putting it in the (now closed) account, they pocketed it and aren't looking back.

I'll keep things short on this part since I'm not seeking legal advice from reddit, my family lawyer looked into it and gave me 2 options: Cut my loses, or take it to court and ultimately lose more mobey. He said PNC is notorious for this on idle savings accounts, as they are too small to make money off of the interest alone, and since there are never any withdrawals, cannot make any money off check/debit card fees or overdraft fees. He fought a few cases just like this over the past decade and lost every single one (he's a good lawyer, too, he has really helped in the past for all sorts of things).

So, I'm fucked. I always thought no matter how bad things got, I could always bail myself out. Fuck you PNC.

tl;dr PNC stole all my money, can't get it back. Absolutely broke, need help. Yes, I am begging. I don't know where else to turn. Please, please, please, anyone. Thank you.

EDIT: Thanks for the advice everyone! I do appreciate it, and I do want to fight this eventually, but doing so isn't going to help my situation right now...I am flat ass broke and I have too many things that need paid like...yesterday. So yes, While I do want to fight this to get my money back, that will take time, which I do not have. I need cash now. I'll take anything I can get. If you're in the Cleveland area, I have the weekend off so I will gladly do ANYTHING (legal) for monetary reward.
I suck at drawing but I consider myself a decent writer if that helps? (Ignore this post, It's written on my phone between panic attacks). I don't know, basically I will do anything I legally can to get some cash in my pocket, and my SO fed and to her job.

Edit 2: Honestly, please stop with the advice... Thinking about this any more is just giving me panic attacks, I've had to deal with it more than enough over the passed week. bottom line, and I hate being this brash, I need money. If you can't do that (and I COMPLETELY understand if you cannot), please just wish me well and don't reply with legal advice. It is hurting my brain.

My friend is now in a coma with part of his skull in the freezer, a broken femur, fractured spine, punctured colon, and many other injuries! Reddit, Please Help!",PleaseHelpTrevor,38,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/zldag/hit_and_run_by_drunk_driver_dragged_my_buddys/,"[Local News Article](http://www.todaysthv.com/news/article/225672/2/At-10-Family-of-I-40-hit-and-run-victim-speaking-out)

My friend, Trevor Ware, was hit from behind by a drunk driver this week while riding his motorcycle on interstate 40 in Arkansas.  Trevor was knocked onto the windshield and his bike wedged under the car.  The driver then proceeded to drive another two miles, dragging the motorcycle, before stopping to finally try and remove it.  

A passerby saw a man on the side of the road drunkenly struggle to remove a motorcycle from under his car, thought it strange and called the police.  Police arrested Nathan Ray onsite, however, he has denied being part of the accident.  This guy has apparently had several arrests already for accidents related to drinking and driving, one of which was a hit run!  Police are running blood samples from his car windshield to confirm DNA to Trevor Ware.

Trevor is now in a coma at UAMS Hospital with many life threatening injuries.  The doctors removed part of his skull to relieve the mounting pressure on his brain.  They are leaving him in a coma until the swelling comes down and the rest of his injuries have a chance to heal.  Doctors have said this will be anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months.  His other injuries include a broken femur close to the hip bone, a fractured spine, a punctured colon, and many scrapes and lacerations.  The neurosurgeon has told the family that surprisingly there may be no permanent brain damage and that there is a chance that his other injuries are also recoverable.  He just needs to make it the three weeks without complications or infection to bring him out of the coma.

The douchebag drunk driver was ticketed in JULY, during another alcohol related accident, for also not having car insurance.  If he hasn't become insured since then, I highly doubt this guy is going to have the money to cover Trevor's mounting hospital bills.  The family is asking for donations through this [website](https://www.everribbon.com/ribbon/view/8352).  Every dime adds up.  

Equally if not more important, the family could use your support through letters.  His girlfriend and family have not left his bedside since the accident.  It is difficult to stay positive in this situation, but that's where a strong community of redditors could really make a huge impact.  So reddit, can you show my buddy that there are better people in the world besides douchebag drunk drivers who can't even apologize for their douchebaggery?!

Update: I just found out that Trevor lost his health insurance in April after he lost his job.  He's been working another job since, but it didn't provide benefits or enough money for insurance...

This may seem like spam but please call and confirm.


I rescued this beautiful 3 month old Husky puppy, who i've named Penny, last Saturday from a terrible home environment with the hopes to give her a loving home and care she deserves. Penny's owners did not take care of her and wanted to be rid of her. So i took Penny into my home and heart. Two days after bringing Penny home she fell very ill. A trip to the veterinarian would discover that Penny had contracted Parvovirus before I rescued her. This virus is one of the worst virus a canine could contract and at such a young age it has a mortality rate of 91%. Penny has began her treatment with her veterinarian and has shown signs of improvement. They have been working to give her the best care they possibly can.


The treatment that Penny is on has come to the point where I can no longer afford to pay for the treatment myself. I'm asking for help to get Penny back on her feet and feeling better. Penny's veterinarian and I have arranged a plan for Penny that will run at $912.04 to continue Penny's treatment. I can not afford this as I have already exhausted my fiances. I'm pleading for a small donations to help Penny at this difficult time. If you could please make an over the phone donation to Penny by contacting her veterinarian's office at (323)919-6666. You could also walk into the office at Veterinary Care Center located at 6666 Santa Monica Blvd. Los Angeles CA, 90038. The veterinarian's website is veterinarycarecenter.com If you trust PayPal my email is xxgirxx509@me.com If you can't make a donation please spread the word. The more people i can have help the better care i can get her.


This is Penny on the day i got her all excited and energetic.Also latest pictures from the vet of her in a lethargic state.

UPDATE:
The vet called me and said Penny has begone accepting solid food. Turkey slices and boiled chicken. They will be taking her off injectables and start giving her oral medication. Penny is taking steps in the right direction. 

2nd UPDATE:
Penny is home! Doctors let me take her home saying that they were confident in her being able to continue her treatment of antibiotics at home. She's eating soft food and drinking on her own. Thank you every one who helped. I'm not sure how much was donated as to we will discuss my payment later. But I know you guys helped and that means a lot.

""Carolynn and Addison met at a flower shop, where she was a floral designer and he did deliveries. They were with other people at the time, but really enjoyed each other’s company as friends. He stopped working at the shop and she didn’t get to see him often. Much later, when the other relationships eventually ran their course, Carolynn ran into Addison at a party, and they hit it off. They have been together for four years now and on a family trip to Italy last year Addison surprised Carolynn with a ring! They went for a walk around the city of Florence, and Carolynn was convinced Addison was going to propose every time they stopped at a romantic place. It wasn’t until they crawled into bed back at the apartment that Addison looked at Carolynn with tears in his eyes and asked her to marry him. It was the happiest and most emotional moment of their lives!

Both Carolynn and Addison want to have an amazing party with all of their family and friends, and not have to worry about the budget! Being in the service industry they think it would be great to relax and not have to be the ones taking care of everyone!

Carolynn says the moment she is most looking forward to is at the reception, when everyone is dancing joyously and she looks across the room, where her eyes meet Addison’s and they give each other huge grins.""

",redditnoobie,44,13,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/pr2xx/pregnant_lady_here_requesting_assistance_to_get/,"Hey guys. Let me just give you a little 411 on my situation... 

I'm pregnant and have been out of work due to extreme morning sickness ('morning' my ass, it lasts all day. Pregnancy is not all butterflies and rainbows. It fucking sucks) and fatigue. 
My boyfriend started a new job, which is suppose to cover all the bills while I'm in the first trimester, however they have their heads up their asses and never pay him. 
Currently, they are going through a shift in management so *HOPEFULLY* this whole payment bullshit is fixed this week. He's suppose to be getting paid on Friday, however they may not pay him for up to another week. (He's doing contracting work and the people that hired him keep moving around pay dates, and it's just been a fucking nightmare. However, when they pay, they pay pretty well. And the new guy they have managing this district seems to be on his game so we *should* have the money on Friday) 

**[start here if you don't want the full 411]**

Our water got shut off today, and they wouldn't work with us to wait till Friday. It'll cost about $130 dollars to get turned back on, so we're hoping someone can help us today or tomorrow and we'll pay them back Friday or as soon as we get paid. Right now I have about 18.00 in the bank and no cash on hand. I can provide proof in a water bill and a screenshot of my current bank balance. 

If anyone could help us out I'd be REALLY grateful. I've been throwing up all morning and would love to be able to brush my teeth and take a bath, not to mention eat later. Paypal would take 3 days to transfer into my account, and I really need the money now, so the only thing I can think of is Western Union (because the water company won't take c.c. numbers over the phone.) PLEASE pm me and let me know if you can provide any assistance for us! Thank you &lt;3


Update: I'm sorry for any inconvenience, but we've decided to just wait till Friday to turn the water back on :/    ",,False,,t5_2s25d,True,,,True,t3_pr2xx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/pr2xx/pregnant_lady_here_requesting_assistance_to_get/,

I know that I am partially at fault so please don't go out of your way to point that out; I promise that will make me cry. Also, please please please don't tell me to just kill them all. I won't and that will also make me cry. I'm a bit of a baby lately. 

I moved into a house on a fairly big lot about 6 years ago. When I moved in, there was a fairly well established feral cat colony already established. I did not realize how big of a problem it was until after I was living here. I didn't know much about feral cat colonies at the time. I though we could ignore them and they would go away. Nope. They killed things and fought and got really really sickly. I felt bad so I started feeding them and trapping some of them to take the the vet. There, they were fixed, given their shots, and returned to my house. I tamed some of them and found them homes. I wormed the ones that I couldn't catch. I was told that even if I removed all of them or put them all down, once a property was used as a site for a feral colony, there would always be a colony there. This seems to be true. It doesn't matter how low the numbers get. More always show up. Early on, when the numbers were really low (three uncatchable feral cats), I started taking in rescues. At this point, people in my small town knew that I would do everything in my power to help sick, hurt, abused, neglected, or homeless animals. Someone would tell me about a cat that was living in a crack house and was being abused and I would show up and not leave until I had the cat. I would help rehab it and place it. People would drop cats off at my property and I would deal with them. At this time, I made decent money and could afford to help. Everything was under control. 

Today, things are very much out of control. At least, that is how I feel at the moment. A number of things happened all at once and everything is a mess. I had to help my mom out financially because my little sister started having severe mental health issues and we ended up with a ton of medical bills. My hours were cut at my job (same with the rest of the staff). I now make less than $3000 a year. I am in graduate school and have to finish an unpaid internship before I can graduate. I love it but it takes a lot of time. I made it through college with very little debt but now I am taking out student loans just to help with my cat/financial situation. I am the first person in my family to go to college. Graduate school is a huge freaking deal to them. I can't quit now when I am so close to being done. I recognize that some of this is just my own pride but I was the kid in town who came from the bad family and I wasn't supposed to amount to anything at all (but that is another story). 

Some of the oldest cats that couldn't be caught have had kittens. People keep dropping off cats without even talking to me. Fewer people are willing to take them in. I spend hundreds of dollars every month on food, vet bills, spaying/neutering, shots, flea meds, wormer, etc. I really can't afford it anymore but I do it. I've contacted cat houses, the humane society, and a few other organizations in Nebraska but I can't find any help outside of paying to have them put down or paying $70 a cat to put them in a shelter where they may or may not be put down. The Cat House is full. I do attend an annual spay and neuter clinic but even with the discount, it is expensive. Last month, my bill was about $400 for 5 cats (shots, wormer, 1 spayed, 4 neutered). Furthermore, people in my town have started doing horrible things to animals (not just mine). Animals are being shot, poisoned, tortured, drugged, drowned, and disappearing. I was in the process of building a cat fence before my financial situation fell apart but now I can't afford it. I'm really scared. I have a cat that needs surgery but I can't get it. It isn't a life or death situation but she needs her left eye removed and I just don't have the money. I feel bad. 

I regularly donate and help others IRL. When I work, I solicit donations from patrons to help with different causes. I have received some help from people in my community (e.g., bags of cat food, a vet bill paid) but I've run out of people to ask. This is a small town. Those who are willing to help with the cats already have and the rest are not willing. I'm not asking anyone to send me money or anything, I'm just looking for ideas on where to go or resources that I can look into. I did post on a different subreddit today where a person was offering help for people in need of pet food. I will be posting proof later. I'm not sure what all I should provide but I'm planning on posting pics of some of the cats, vet bills, a facebook post where I talked about animals being abused in town, a post offering kittens free to a good home, and a pic of one of my pay stubs. If you want anything else, let me know. 

TL;DR I tried to help cats when I was able to do so. I am no longer able to do as much and will be struggling for the next few months. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will return the favor when I am done with my internship and able to get a better job. 

If you want the town that I live in or my phone number or anything, please pm me. I am uncomfortable posting those things. 

**EDIT: PROOF:**
I have uploaded some photos of a few of the cats (more to follow because we have a ton now), a few of the vet bills (same), one of my most recent pay stubs, and some old facebook posts about the things being done to pets.

**Edit** - changed imgur to an album because I missed one person's information on facebook and can't delete the pic. So I made it private and put everything else in a public album - added a fixed version of that picture as well as screenshots of a donation I received today from a redditor who has just blown me away. I cannot thank this person enough.

**Edit**

I wanted to give some numbers in terms of how many cats are currently here and how many are feral. 

We have 5 feral cats left over from the original colony. These cats have been wormed but not fixed. 4 are females and 1 is male.

We have 2 black cats that were dropped off and are mostly tame They act like they really want to be pets. One of the black ones was pregnant when she was dropped off. She has had 3 kittens (the gray, black, and black and white ones in the photos). I am unsure about their vet history. They are not fixed so that is on the agenda. Same with shots and wormer.

We have 1 male black and white cat that was beaten pretty badly. He is learning to trust people again. He has his shots but isn't fixed. This is on the agenda.

We have 1 really old yellow tomcat that was left at a house after his owner was placed in a nursing home. Her children don't want him so now he is here. His face is messed up from a dog attack. We've been putting antibiotics on it but need to take him to a vet. 

We have 1 tame cat with a genetic eye problem. She has been fixed and has all shots. No one wants a cat who is going blind. 

We have 1 tame long haired black cat that lived in a meth house. He is fixed and has all of his shots. I'm also trying to find him a home. 

We have 1 Siamese mix. He was found when he was two weeks old and bottle fed. He has a bunch of anxiety problems and has been poisoned in the past. He can't be placed because he is neurotically attached to me. He has his shots and has been fixed.

We have 1 long hair gray and white cat that was literally stuck to the highway during winter. He has been fixed and has his shots.

We have 1 short hair siamese looking cat with an eye that needs removed. She came from the cat with the bad eye that was mentioned above. She will also go blind. She has all of her shots and has been fixed. 

We have 2 male tiger striped cats that have seizure disorders. They are fixed and have shots. They also came from a meth house. 

We have 1 big gray cat and 1 big long haired orange cat. They were my first cats. They're mother was hit by a car when they were kittens. The others from the litter died and my professor gave them to me to bottle feed. He was going to put them down. The gray one has rolling back syndrome. 

We also currently have 2 long hair gray/white siamese-ish kittens (6 weeks old and tame), 1 tiger striped/calico male kitten (6 weeks old and tame), 1 yellow male kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black female kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a white tip on his tale (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a calico face (tame and 8 weeks old), 3 tiger striped kittens and 1 yellow kitten that are special needs kittens. They were born in someone's basement and the mother disappeared. They were almost dead when they were brought over. They are being bottle fed at the moment. They will need a lot of attention. I think they are about 5 weeks old. I don't know if anyone will ever take them. All of these kittens need homes.

Super kind hearted lady. And i found out where she lives and i know she lives alone so I think in return ima cut her grass a couple times this summer. That means i only need $300 now though :) . 

UPDATE: I was given $100 as an early birthday present from a friend i havent talked to in years. So now i only need $400.

I posted in r/loans yesterday but i was told this subreddit would be better. I recently posted in this subreddit asking for help again too. 

I have to come up with $300 or im gonna be homeless. I am going to be as honest as i can be so please hear me out.

I have been asking for help for things recently as I lost my job (late too many times (3 times in 3 weeks) due to no reliable transportation and no driver's license) a month ago. I was doing side jobs to get by but I finally just got a new job today and its a good one. I had my rent money in my wallet but it was stolen sometime when i was riding the public bus I think. Now i only have 2 days to get that money somehow. I would try getting a small loan but I have the worst credit due to identity theft while i was in the Marines. I haven't gotten it fixed but the person finally wasn't able to put anything else in my name so i can start to fix it. But this is keeping me from getting a loan. I had a car but i had to get rid off it when it broke down because the payments were too high, i didnt have a license anyways, and i couldnt pay to fix it. So i can't get a title loan either.

At the moment, i am completely broke. All the money i had was in that wallet. And I don't have enough money to feed myself, do laundry, pay for anything really. I just begged a friend to get me something off the dollar menu at McDonalds for dinner tonight.

But i have learned my lesson and I wont carry that much cash around in my wallet anymore. I do have a bank account but i wanted to just hand the cash over tomorrow morning to my landlord but now that's not gonna happen.

At this new job, Manager position at a new local pet store not even a mile from my house, i will be making more money than I ever have BUT i wont get my first pay check till Monday, the 8th of July. I can pay you back, up to $100, then and get on a regular paying schedule of up to $100 every check until i pay it off, plus some interest for helping me out in my time of need.

And i don't want to pull the sad cards as the #1 reason why i need help but I really have nothing. And i finally have this one hope but then this happens.

So i need exactly $300 and it's all going to rent and that's it. Im willing to take whatever you offer of course, but I can only pay back $100 at time. If you can only help me with a smaller loan like $50 or $100, we can work out something else as a payback solution. Im open to any terms.

If you can only lend me $20, $50, $100 or whatever you can, I will pay it all back plus 20% interest. And I won't take more than the $300 I actually need whether its from one person or a dozen. 

I use reddit everyday and I promise, for what its worth, that you will get your money back. I am even comfortable giving you my address, facebook page, email address, etc. I would give you a phone number but my iphone broke last week and I can't afford to buy a new one right now, i didnt have phone insurance.

A little bit about me. Im 21 years old. I am completely independent and i don't live with parents/family. I have been on my own for 3 years now. I have been buying my own clothes, groceries, gas, car insurance, etc since i was 15. My father kicked me out on my 18th birthday, right before I went off to college (which i couldnt afford and had to drop out after one semester). I was in the Marines for one year before getting a rib infection and receiving a Honorable Discharge for Medical Reasons. I am all cleared for work now but I can't apply for benefits until I turn 24. I can't go back into the Military until then either. I love sports, especially basketball. I love pets and I wanna be a vet. I have no criminal record, one traffic violation but it was dismissed in court, I have never been in any trouble in school. I have always been fairly quiet and shy. At every job I have had I was the favorite. I won many employee of the months and promotions. And one time I won a free nintendo wii on the radio for getting the worst christmas gift (furniture/couch fixer kit from my dad when i was 19 and i didnt have a couch)

Anything else you want to know, please feel free to ask.

Im very open to any conditions you may have, please feel free to offer anything you want. Im pretty desperate as you can tell.

I am very fortunate that I am able to live on my own, but I need help with various daily-living activities, including help getting in and out of bed and in and out of my wheelchair.


Because of my injury, I have developed osteoporosis and this makes me prone to bone fractures.


As time has passed, this issue has worsened to the point that I can no longer be transferred safely by my Home Health Aides. I have broken bones while simply getting in and out of bed.


There is an apparatus called a Ceiling Track Lift that would enable anyone to safely transfer me into my wheelchair, bed and even my shower. Currently, we can no longer risk the transfer into the shower, as it is a very precarious transfer.


Because of my disability, I live on a very modest, fixed income, and by being very careful with my money, I am able to take care of my ordinary day to day needs... but I desperately need help raising the funds for the track lift and its installation.


My hope is that when others hear my story, I will be able, through the donations of kind and generous people, to greatly improve my health, safety and quality of life.

Prevent Frozen Pipes
 
When the temperature drops below 20 degrees Fahrenheit, pipes run the risk of freezing and bursting, causing major damage. To prevent pipes from freezing, wrap your interior pipes in foam pipe insulation.
 
Also turn on a faucet and allow it to slowly drip, decreasing the pressure in the pipes. This could prevent bursting if the pipes do freeze. If you expect to be away during a particularly cold spell, turn off your water valve entirely.  


If you suspect a pipe has frozen, call a plumber and turn off the water supply to prevent flooding. You can also try to thaw a pipe with a blow-dryer, or by wrapping the pipes with hot, wet towels. Never use an open flame

""You may know Don Mott from his time dedicated to serving on the Steele Canyon Board, or possibly as a band dad, a theater dad, or cheer dad. You may know him as a loving father, a member of your family, or a loyal friend. He stands proud to all these titles, and humbly lives his life as each of these, with a beaming smile and open arms. 

At the core of his being Don has always known he is most happy being a father of three, and contributing selflessly to the community. After Don was laid off in October of 2012, he did not give up and continued to donate his time to others. Eager, optimistic, and disciplined he was sure another career opportunity would come. By December, Don was still unemployed but feeling hopeful. 

His life was then turned upside down when in that month he suffered from three heart attacks. On December 13th, after his third heart attack, doctors at Sharp Grossmont Hospital took him into an intense seven hour open-heart surgery. After the quadruple bypass, Don remained in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for a week before he could return home to his three daughters. 

Now at home, Don is healing well. However, the struggle has not subsided. With continuous nurse care, hospital bills, and his inability to work, the family is asking the community for help.""

I'm really scared...,213947520368153,43,8,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/12755r/how_can_i_get_away_from_my_abusive_parents_as_an/,"I am stuck and absolutely terrified.  I have no idea how to get out of this, and everything I have tried has ended in failure. I don’t know what to do, I need help…

For now I won’t go into detail about how I got in this situation or what I’ve done in the past to try to get out, but I will explain if anyone requests it.  This is more of a snapshot of where I am right now. I’m sorry that it’s so long, I wasn’t sure what I could cut out to shorten it without losing any details I felt were important.

I am a 21 year old female with two dogs. One is a 13 year old mutt that I absolutely can't part with, and the other is a 2 year old puppy that was left with me after an abusive relationship went sour. My parents are emotionally abusive, sometimes physically, and I have been in several abusive relationships in the past, one involving rape and threats of blackmail on a very regular basis. I was able to escape from all of that for close to 2 years, and had a very successful life during that time. But everything kept going wrong, and eventually the PTSD and anxiety caught up with me and things started going downhill.

I ended up back with my parents and have been here since April. They constantly put me down and make me feel worthless. To them, if you're not 100% successful immediately at everything you try, you are an absolute failure, no in-betweens. They interrogate me for several minutes every time I leave my room, not because of any trust issues but just to be nosy and controlling. They yell at me or cry every time I talk to them, because they say I always have an attitude or are giving them angry looks, when I'm not even mad and didn't mean to, and honestly didn't realize if I was. I’m always told how I haven’t said a kind word to them in months, and they yell at me for backtalking when I bring up examples of when I did. We get in stupid arguments, and whenever I stay calm and try to use logic they go in circles with what I say or mock me it until it ends up making no sense. They purposely do things that they know trigger my PTSD and panic attacks, and then when I react in even the smallest way (which I try not to), they threaten to call their cop friends to have me arrested for ""elder abuse"", or they say that if I don't stop my “tantrum” immediately they will call an ambulance and get me put in a mental hospital. We have tried family therapy with two different therapists, both times mom cried the whole time and dad yelled over everyone, not letting anyone else talk, so that he can get his point across that they are great parents and all our problems are caused by me. It does more harm than good, so we stopped going. 

It's really confusing because I KNOW they love me and don't mean it. It makes me feel like it is all fault. In front of friends, or if I get on their good side somehow, they are really nice. They tell me they love me, they are so proud of me, that I’m so smart and talented, and that I “just don’t realize it yet” and that’s why I’m “not making the right decisions with my life”. They say they are so happy I’m back at home with them again. They make sure I have everything I need, plus some. They pay for my food, insurance, doctor bills. They even pay for my dogs' food and vet visits. They occasionally let me drive my car (which is registered to them, so it’s not technically mine) if I need to go somewhere, as long as I give them very specific details of what I’m going to do and get home before dark, and they pay for gas money and insurance. They get their friends and family (who they have purposely kept me very distant from) to call me or invite me places, specifically to let me know that I’m so fortunate to have such wonderful parents, and that I should be eternally grateful for all they do and stop treating them like shit, because “most parents wouldn’t do so much for their children”. They always refuse to believe anything negative I have told them about how my parents treat me or what has happened in my life, instead blaming it all on me.

I have tried talking to my parents very calmly, telling them how I feel and trying to find solutions to our disagreements. This usually ends in one of two ways. Their most common reaction is that they list the things they have done for me, then point out my flaws and all the mistakes that I have ever made. They remind me what a disappointment and failure I am and compare me to people that they know have abused me in the past, and then guilt me for being such a burden to them all the time. Then they start turning it around, blaming themselves for “raising me wrong”, trying to reason that everything bad that I do is their fault. The other common reaction that happens is that mom will immediately start to cry for being ""a failure as a parent"", and telling me that “I will regret everything I’ve done to them when they are dead”. Then dad will get violent and because I upset her, even if he has absolutely no idea what happened. He will get in my face and yell until I am in tears. Since I've turned 18 he's mostly refrained from hitting me unless I ""acted out"", which was only when he physically cornered me or held me against a wall, and I panicked and shoved him off me. I haven’t even done that much the last few times out of fear.

To make things even more conflicting, my dad was diagnosed with cancer around the beginning of September. I took a month off from everything in my life to stay almost 24/7 with him while he was in the hospital so that mom could get a chance to rest and take care of the insurance paperwork and anything else she needed to do. He is now cancer-free, they were able to remove it since it was in very early stages and hadn't spread, and he started chemo last week. They said that some of the medications they gave him during chemo, especially the steroids, could cause him to be in a bad mood. And by bad mood they apparently meant both him and mom, at every chance they got, accusing me of not caring about them at all and ruining their lives. I mean, I'm very sympathetic and understanding about what he’s going through, that some of it is from side effects and stress. But this has been going on for years even before that, and in my opinion, it is still no excuse for them to take out their anger on me. I'm absolutely sick of it. I know they need me to stay and help, but I feel like they should have thought about that before they treated me how they did. Am I wrong for feeling like that?…

I had a tiny bit of confidence left when I moved back here, but now I feel like it has all been shattered, along with every last bit of hope that I had that things might someday get better for me. Now I question everything that I do, wondering if I’m right or wrong. Anything from leaving my room to use the bathroom, to going outside for a walk, I’m terrified that I will get yelled at for something I didn’t mean to do or say. I never trust myself enough to know whether I was the cause of an argument or if they really were being unreasonable. I want to get out of here, I want to get away from abuse forever and be treated like a human for once in my life. But I know that if I escape it again, it will probably end in failure again because of my PTSD and anxiety, which is so bad sometimes that it is absolutely disabling.

I feel like a terrible, selfish person for wanting to get out of this, especially with my dad going through chemo. They need me, and all I can think about is running away from my problems. I know they won’t live forever, and I want to make the most of the time I have with them, but at the same time I want to protect myself. But I’m afraid to even do that because it might upset them…

I have tried everything to get out of here. None of my friends can help, relatives and family friends refuse to believe me when I try to explain what is happening. I've called women’s shelters, abuse hotlines, suicide hotlines, talked to therapists. I've tried literally everything that's been recommended to me, and I have no idea where I can go, even *without* my dogs!

I'm willing to find a temporary home for my puppy until I get back on my feet, possibly even a permanent home for him, but I absolutely can't part with my older dog unless it’s very temporary. He's been with me since I was 8 and has endured similar abuse from them. So honestly, sometimes he is the only thing keeping me motivated to live at this point. I have no other reason, and I think about that a lot. It worries me.

I have a friend across the US that might be able to help me. My current plan, if things don’t change soon, is to hitchhike to get there. I don’t see many other options since I only have about $50 and refuse to leave my older dog behind. I've got the supplies and I've got almost everything packed. I know it's risky, especially with winter coming up and without a solid plan for once I get there, but I really don't care at this point. I can't take this much longer. But every opportunity I’ve gotten, I can’t seem to get myself to leave, because of this constant fear of their reaction to it.

I don't know what to do. I don't know what other options I have. It seems like there HAS to be some way to get out of this, but how? I've tried everything, asked everyone that I can. NO ONE knows where to turn! I just need help…

I really hate to ask for help from people that I don’t know, but I have no idea what else to do. I don’t mean to beg, but at this point I will take whatever help anyone can offer, whether it is some advice on what I can do, a temporary or permanent home for my puppy, resources where I can get help, anything. I fully intend to pay it forward when I'm able, whether it's repayment to the people who help me or in the form of giving help to others. This is a throwaway account, and I'm willing to PM mods or anyone from my active account if it is needed for anything.

Thank you all so much for anything you can offer, even if it’s just kind words. It really does mean the world to me.

My husband decided to run a marathon for charity after our beloved cat, Cassie, passed away unexpectedly last October. In 2010 he had trained for his first-ever marathon in Myrtle Beach...which was canceled in a random ""blizzard"" (a light dusting of snow). He ended up running his own Marathon of One two days later just so he could officially run a marathon (this meant that he ran alone on a chilly trail for 4 hours while I drove to different points to bring him water!). Running 26.2 miles without any spectators to cheer is depressing - he deserves to run a real marathon...with real water stops! :)

I am 15 yrs. old , i live in Romania (Timisoara) and my sister , Adina (19 yrs. old), was born with a malformation (an obstruction at the pelviureteric junction) which was discovered too late and she had renal failure . Multiple surgeries were done but the doctors figured only a transplant could keep her alive and so my mother had to donate her kidney . A deceased donor was considered but due to the rarity of the blood type (A-negative) and the small number of possible donors , the doctors abandoned this option . 
The transplant was done in 29th of August 2003 , it wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't the support of some christian families and the doctors , especially prof. Dr. Mihai Lucan who performed the transplant . 

... but now the worst is happening , the donated kidney has failed in the middle of 2011 and Adina is currently studying in the first year at the Timişoara University of Medicine and Pharmacy this puts her through a very difficult time .
She is undergoing hemodialysis which occupies most of the time she would spend studying (one session every two days which takes approx. 3 hours ,usually starting from 5 pm 'till 8-9 pm ) and leaves her drained of life - the average life expectancy for a dialysis patient is 3-5 years , not even enough to finnish the studies and become a doctor .

A retransplant , from my father this time , was programmed in september 2011 but my parents couldn't gather enough money (the transplant costs around 20,000 euros , 26,742 dollars) . Again we were helped by the local baptist churches but the cost is a very large sum and the truth is that the people are poor around here . My sister feels hopeless , my parents and others try to comfort her that everything will turn out fine even though in reality things are pretty hard .
I never tought her life will depend on the pity of the others around , but Reddit , today i am asking for an act of goodwill . If everyone would donate about $1 we would need 26,742 donations (0.0026 % of the monthly Reddit visits) .

So Reddit all I am asking for is giving someone a chance to life , i am really desperate , please if you can , donate , it would mean very much to me , my parents and my sister who is the most ambitious person I've seen despite the many difficulties she encountered and the burden of living in such a condition . 
She is smart and even though these are some dark times for her , she is trying to be optimistic , she passed the highschool graduation exams with flying colors - which many students failed due to recent changes against cheating , around 44, 47% passed - and got admitted to the faculty of medicine . 

I don't want to lose her ...

Fellow Redditors, can we help?",0hn035,38,8,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hwh6p/pregnant_kind_single_woman_in_las_vegas_is/,"Recently, I was selling some things on craigslist that are no longer needed in my household.  My partner and I weren't looking to get a lot of money out of them - mostly just to get rid of them.  I got an email from a woman who couldn't afford the $20 for the television, but was willing to ask her mother for it.  I obviously told her it was hers, no money required.  She thanked me with so much warmth I thought my heart was going to break.  We started emailing back and forth, and I got a few tidbits about her life... 

She's now 6 months pregnant (I am 9, so seeing her in so much need with a baby on the way *plagues* me every night when I go to sleep.)  She went through a messy divorce at some point, but had been happily married for about 10 years, with children.  I don't know where those children are now.  The ""gentleman"" who got her pregnant left her.  Despite all of this, she is so thankful to be pregnant and so happy to meet her new baby.  She seems to be all alone in Las Vegas, very similar to myself, and I want to help her.  

My partner and I also gave her the other items we were trying to get rid of... a microwave, some knick knacks.  I just keep kicking myself that I can't do more.  It honestly brings me to tears.  I've been worrying about her for about a month, and then I found this subreddit.  

Do you think, fellow redditors, that we could help her out?  Maybe have her set up a baby registry somewhere so we could help out her little one?  The thought of a new baby in an impoverished home scares me when I am so close to my due date.  If you want proof, I can submit pictures of the emails we exchanged, she was very willing to be forthcoming with information and pictures so I wouldn't feel like I was giving things to a scam artist.  I would love to be able to help this woman find a second chance in life.

She wrote: ""Oh, by the way, please do not throw anything away, as you had mentioned that you would like to know what I needed, and I am also starting over. I will not be too prideful, as to not let you know that although, I do not want you to sacrifice anything you need or are using...I am in need of just about everything, so please don't make unneeded trips to the garbage, or donation center...I would be happy to come pick up anything, you have extra...
Mostly I need baby items, dishes, flatware, anything for the kitchen...pictures to hang..a lamp, end tables, or maternity clothes...Again, I am not requesting that you make any further efforts, especially for me...but if you are already getting rid of some things..I am in need of much, and would not mind picking anything up, directly from your place, at your convenience.  
 Thanks so much, and I truly hope that I have not been to forward...
It is very humbling, to come from a big house in Summerlin, and a marriage that lasted over a decade, to where I am today...But God continues to provide amazing miracles in my life, and I have been extremely blessed. ""

I'm not sure how to go about it, or if anyone else is willing to help.  Input?  

Thanks guys.

It was purchased at either a Hallmark or a Carlton Cards in Ottawa, ON, Canada in the fall of 2010. http://i.imgur.com/LhqsWPg.jpg?1 http://i.imgur.com/AbX6sKs.jpg?2

Teddy quickly became the little man's best friend, going absolutely everywhere with him. A couple of weeks ago, Teddy was left at preschool one afternoon, never to be seen again. The teachers can't locate him, the parents were asked to check and no one came forward that it was sent home by accident. A site search was made... no teddy. The little guy was and still is devastated. We have been to every Hallmark and Carlton Cards shop within a 90 minute drive. None have one that compares.

We've turned to an online search and can't find it. It needs to have the green flower over the heart area and a green thread nose. Can you help? Does anyone know who manufactures plush toys for these companies? Have any leads finding inventory from that time period? Do you have one willing to sell? Any help is appreciated. Thank you. 

Even if you can't help, can you upvote me for visibility? (No karma conspiracy since its a selfpost = no karma)  I just want to try and help find another teddy for my sweetheart of a nephew and for my sister who is so upset to lose such a cherished item.

**[UPDATE] It is not A Beanie Buddy**
Well, its not Gund, TY Beanie Baby or Buddy, Build A Bear or Build A Buddy.  Not on Hallmark list or Carlton/Schurman Retail Group.  Have looked at over 75,000 blue teddy bears.  This one is not online.  However, with your help we've found some really decent alternatives that might work if we can't locate this particular one.

**[Update 2]**  Thanks to your help we've found a very close stand-in http://www.bbtoystore.com/store/BD_addison.html
However, I'll leave this as 'unresolved' for now just in case somebody does know where to get the real Teddy.  Thanks so much everyone!

**[UPDATE 3]  The bear is made by a brand called Animal Alley, often sold through Toys R Us!  We haven't found the exact bear yet, but Reddit detectives have helped us in such a huge way to narrow down brand and search in this world of a billion blue teddy bears!  Thank you!**

**[Final Update]**  At this point, we've found enough information to source a new bear for my nephew.  Thank you everyone.

I am a 21 year old non-verbal autistic girl who was traveling with my father from Michigan to Idaho, and now we are trying to get from Utah to New York to my aunt's house. He was promised a job in Idaho Falls, Idaho, and we took all our money and drove there but when we got here they had given the job to someone else. Our car's suspension broke in the Utah mountains. We went to the LDS church (we're mormon) but all they would give us is a tank of gas, and we've been pulled over 3 times because of the suspension, and every time is several hours explaining I'm not being abused/purposely aggravating the cops/on drugs, I'm just autistic, in overload from fear and the lights/sirens, non-verbal, and terrified of police officers because of how easily they mistake sensory overload and non-verbalness for agitation/drugs and non-compliance. We're trying to find a place to camp for the night now, or get as far into utah or (we hope maybe even) wyoming as we can before we run too low on gas, and then get help getting our car fixed, and food and gas to get to my aunts.

We would be happy to have my dad talk to someone by phone to confirm this and we'll do whatever we can to reassure anyone who wants to help, but we have no way to get to anyone we know: less than $50, a tank of gas, and half a box of saltines, driving a cop magnet. We're exhausted, hungry, dirty, smelly, and scared.

Thank you very much.
Bettie

Edit: 3G went out for most of Utah and wyoming. I don't know if it will go out again. A nice guy gave us $50 and topped us off late last night, so we're trying to make it into Nebraska to a campground we saw on the way out. There was wifi nearby, and if we have no trouble we should get there by noon, so if 3G goes out I'll respond then.

Thank you again,
Bettie

Edit: We reached the campground, but Dad's real sick, trying to sleep in the car gave him a scintilating scatoma (I probably spelled that wrong), which for him is a cross between a optical migraine and a ministroke, so we'll be here at least a day before he can drive. If someone wants to help with food but is too far away, I can pm you info the camp office gave me info on a local pizza place that delivers and lets you order and pay online. It doesn't need to be much, we still have a sleeve of saltines, but some food would be really nice. 

If anyone's in the west end of Nebraska along I-80 and wants to maybe meet to help us, I can pm you where we are. I don't have cell phone service here, but if you are local, the camp might let us call.

Thank you all again so much.
Bettie

Edit:


We got in touch with the church near the campgrounds and got another tank of gas, and drove to a walmart about 50 miles down the road and are waiting a few hours to see if our family can send anything. Then we'll either sleep in the car or try and find another campground.

Dad's panicking about when we get to illinois, because the cops there are rediculously quick to pull people over and the last officer didn't return all our papers (I think we're only missing the insurance, not certain though) He's afraid if their reputation is valid, they might take him and our car with all our stuff and not listen to him when he explains about me and I might get taken away from him or hurt. I'm trying to not think about it because me panicking is the last thing we need. I got really badly sun burned riding in the car, and I get real sick when I get burned, so I'm kinda out of it. No cell service still, but we figured out how to make outgoing calls via the internet when we have wifi, which we should have for at least an hour, so if anyone wants to talk to my Dad, pm me a number. Thank you so much,
Bettie

Edit: we'll be in Iowa in about an hour and a half. A big thank you to u/uobtyx for the pizza, we're still eating it. I don't know if you read through my post history to learn I do better with real sugar soda, but it's let me drink enough water to avoid getting really sick, so thank you so much.

Thank you to all the wonderful bishops and people we have called/met by chance who give us a litle cash or a tank of gas to keep us going. I doubt you will see this, but we wouldn't have made it this far without you.

I'm Mike O'Brien and I could use your help.
For the past 4 years I've been trying to get a heart transplant and because of the heart defect I was born with I was shot down over and over again.

Why?
Because no adults have heart transplant with my heart defect. There have been successful transplants on children but because most people don't survive into their adulthood it's very rare to see an adult with a Fontan
and Protein Losing Enteropathy.

What changed?
After hounding Doctors for years, one of my cardiologists got in touch with another who is an expert at Adult Congenital Heart Disease/Defects. And has seen adults with Fontan/PLEs. Having just left Harvard to come to Stanford he may be able to save my life. In the past few weeks he has already had me seen by a Liver Transplant doctor, a pediatric Immunologist, adult Immunologist, adult heart failure and transplant surgeon and I will soon be seeing the pediatric heart failure and transplant surgeons.

Everyday I get closer and closer to achieving what I always felt was the impossible. But I never gave up, the worst that could happen in my mind was they tell me no. But now that I'm so close to achieving my life long goal, I am sinking deeper in debt due to medical bills, travel,food costs, rent,etc. Everything is piling up.
What about insurance?
I have two insurances already; medicare and medi-cal. However transplants can cost millions of dollars. And there are lifelong costs afterwards. The drug costs,hospital visits,travel,food,etc. A lot of the transplant medications are not covered by insurance due to most of them being very experimental. And yes, they are very very expensive.

The first 6 months to a year after the transplant will cost more money than I can even imagine right now. And they will be the most difficult for me health wise due to possible rejection, side effects from drugs and side effects from the transplant.

The $5000 I'm asking for isn't going to even come close to covering the next year for me, it probably won't even cover the next month. But I hate being greedy and there are so many other great things you can contribute your money to, or use for yourself to have a good time and enjoy your own lives. But whatever you feel you can help with I'd appreciate.

If you have any questions feel free to ask.
I also have a blog at http://apaleoheart.com

I can put up as much information as possible. I'll try my best to make a video when I'm feeling better(sick right now) and I'll post a letter from one of my previous cardiologists about my medical history.

My name is Sharon, and I'm a junior at Northwestern University. My sorority sister, Josie, has [cystic fibrosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_fibrosis) and is down to ~16% of her lung function, so she recently got put on the lung transplant list. (Here's [proof](http://imgur.com/HEGBy9h).) While she's waiting, her family has to come up with the $75,000 (out of $750,000 for the whole operation) that her insurance isn't covering on top of all of their other medical bills, and I was really hoping that Reddit could help. 

Josie's mom set up an indiegogo page to raise money a few months ago, and even though there's been an outpouring of support from Josie's friends and family, it's raised nowhere near $75,000. There are only 53 hours left on the page (I set up an account 3 months ago almost to the day so that I could post this here, but that means there's not much time left), and Josie's family would be so appreciative of anything that you guys would be willing to give.

[Here's](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/josie-nordman-s-lung-transplant) the link to the indiegogo page. Reddit - we've got 53 hours to raise over $30,000, and having seen the fundraising miracles that this incredible community has pulled off before, I really hope we can do it. Josie's mom is hoping for a few more hundred dollars by the time this closes, but I'm hoping to give her an awesome surprise instead.

And a few days before Christmas, after being put on life support and needing resuscitation multiple times, he decided to make the choice to end all of the suffering. He was a close friend of mine and we went to high school together. Throughout Thomas's cancer, him and his family became victim to an internet scammer and two weeks before Thomas passed, he said to his mom and to others to, ""fine that woman! What if she is doing this to another family? We need to stop her."" **So in honor of his last wish, here is that story (proof/news articles) at the bottom. I know that this post is likely to get buried, but I'm trying all I can do to help my friends family in need. It's cost them so much hurt and suffering and I just want to get the message out there....**

Here's their story about the hoax and Thomas's battle written by his mother: 


""To make a long story short, we were targeted by a hoaxer that goes by the name of Jonnica Ellis (if that is her true identity). She went to extreme measures to convince us that her offer to help us was legitimate, however, it cost Thomas eight weeks of lost time in terms of receiving any medical attention. Our own fundraising efforts to raise the money to get Thomas to San Diego were put on hold since we believed Ms. Ellis and thought she was an answer to our prayers. What she offered would have been g a miraculous “gift” and thinking it was true, both Thomas and our family were filled with hope. As a result, I quickly began making arrangement to leave for San Diego and the alternative care treatment that we believe will save Thomas’ life.""

*(San Diego was the best hope they had of saving him)*

""Unfortunately, the promise went unfulfilled with each passing day, and days turned into weeks with one excuse after another. They came in the form of emails, forged Ally Bank statements, certified cashier’s checks produced and altered by Ms. Ellis herself, while trying to prove she had sent the $250,000, and countless forms of communications via phone calls, texts, and emails telling us the “Check was in the mail” and that she would even cover the costs to save our home from the looming foreclosure with Chase Bank. Ms. Ellis even went so far as to send Thomas a huge bouquet of “Yellow” flowers (Thomas’ favorite color which Ms. Ellis admitted to knowing after viewing Thomas’ website video) with a card that basically told him his troubles were over. We finally realized Jonnica Ellis was just a crazed fan of our friend, Johnathan Hillstrand, from the Deadliest Catch TV series and that Ms. Ellis, after seeing Johnathan’s video asking his fans to help raise funds for Thomas, began using Thomas’ story in a sad attempt to get Johnathan’s attention by making an impression upon him! Links to this media story, covered by many news outlets, can be seen on Thomas' website at **www.HealThomas.com.**
I am battle worn, but will never give up hope. God continues to be my ROCK! My faith has me at peace enough with the Jonnica Ellis situation to focus on caring for my boys and viewing her as just a pathetic person in need of her own spiritual healing.""

*Their home of 14 years is now being foreclosed because of all of this.* 

""Over the past three years, Thomas has gone through long term excruciating pain, four major surgeries, and countless chemo sessions that required many admissions to Children’s Hospital. This caused the anticipated nausea, and of course, the extreme weight loss and depression that follows. Soon after we arrived in San Diego Thomas was rushed to Children's Hospital Emergency facility due to a new tumor that rapidly began growing during the eight week period of waiting with NO Treatment, after Children’s Hospital said there was nothing more they could offer Thomas. Thomas was in uncontrollable, excruciating pain that could have been prevented weeks before, but by that time the tumor began pressing on the nerves in his lower back. From the facility, we had to rush Thomas to the Emergency Room in downtown San Diego, 45 minutes away - Thomas literally passed out in the car on the way to the hospital! We spent the next 14 days at Children’s where Thomas underwent 6 rounds of painful radiation and had to be transported by ambulance daily that required a 30 minute trip to and from the radiation center. Doctor Young, the founder of the alternative treatment center in San Diego, was convinced and adamant that what Thomas experienced could have been avoided had he started the treatments even 6 weeks earlier! The nearly 8 week stall due to the Ellis hoax set progress back so much so that at one point Children’s, insisted Thomas be admitted into their ICU unit and we were informed they didn't expect he would leave that room! (A mother’s heart can only take so much and mine broke again that day.) There are still so many emotions that accompany this subject that it would literally take a book to convey the whole story. Suffice it to say, Thomas suffered the most horrific pain for weeks due to the delay from a prank played on an innocent, extremely sick, vulnerable young man, by a deranged woman who went to extreme measures to gain the attention of a celebrity. 

While at Children’s, Thomas was put on the highest amount of pain medicine that a person his size could be given without it challenging his breathing. I spent most of my days and nights keeping watch over the monitors. He was on a total of 4-5 different pain medications all at once for most of the two week stay. Watching him hooked up to the machines and IV’s day after day was more than I could bare, but I never allowed Thomas to see me with anything less than an assured look of love and confidence that we would soon be on the road to recovery. Because I knew we were!

 Thank you in advance for your continued prayers and support. Much love and gratitude to you all!""

Hi Reddit. I'm a graduate student and a former kindergarten teacher. I live in California and am working my way through school. 

This summer, I made friends with a young girl in Wuxi, China. Her name is Yiming (not her real name). Her mom is a migrant laborer from the countryside, her dad is in prison, and she lives in a run-down migrant village on the outskirts of town. 

Yiming is an amazing child. I've taught and been around a lot of kids in my days of teaching, and she is definitely one of the most intelligent, inquisitive, spunky, and warm-hearted 11-year-olds I have ever met. I wish I could tell you all the stories I have about her. 

The long and short of it, though, is that Yiming was until recently at a run-down, for-profit, low-quality migrant school that does not tap her potential at all. As a migrant, she is barred from attending the local public school, and as the child of a single mother, she cannot return to her hometown for education. 

Very near her house is an excellent nonprofit school for talented students -- but it's four times as expensive (to cover the more-qualified teachers' salaries). I visited the school, spoke with the principal and several teachers, and have been in phone contact from the US. It's legit. 

This September, I was able to arrange for Yiming to take the entrance examination. She passed with flying colors. With contributions from my immediate family, I was able to enroll her for one semester ($800). So far, although she has struggled to overcome her deficit in preparation, her intelligence and hard work have given her significant improvement in the past few months. If she continues to be enrolled, she has a great chance of testing into high school, and out of the cycle of migrant exclusion and poverty. 

Although it's hard to imagine an American private school that costs this little, I can't afford to cover it all myself for the next five years. My family and friends have helped a bit but they are having hard times as well. 

[So, I'm asking you to consider this: as part of your Christmas giving this year, would you be willing to help me support Yiming's education? $160 will pay for about a month of school for her, $45 for one week, $15 will cover two awesome days, $5 will absolutely help. If the answer is yes, I am extremely grateful. If it won't work right now, I am still very grateful for your consideration.](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&amp;business=bill%2ewelsh%2e75%40gmail%2ecom&amp;lc=US&amp;currency_code=USD&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)

If you choose to donate, and you wish to receive updates, I will share details of her educational progress by email (respecting everyone's confidentiality, of course). I call Yiming and her mother every week to check up, and I am in frequent contact with the teachers, so it's easy to see how it's all going.

Please help,rojoga,44,15,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1465y4/my_uncle_has_just_passed_away_after_a_15_year/,"My uncle Jeff Norris was diagnosed with brain cancer 15 years ago. Since then every day has been a constant battle against this relentless disease with the occasional glimpse of hope amidst ever increasing bad news. Over the past month the tumor was deemed inoperable and Jeff made the difficult decision to forego the suffering of additional chemotherapy. With the help of hospice care and the tireless efforts of his family he was able to remain at home until his 15 year struggle came to an end today (12/2/2012), he was 46 years old.

Before losing his ability to communicate Jeff in formed our family of his wish to donate his brain to Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (where he has been a patient since the onset of the disease) in hopes that it may aid in future research and one day a cure to this dreaded disease. Unfortunately, after contacting the hospital, we were informed that it would cost over $1000 to have his body transferred to the hospital and returned for burial. This came as devastating news as our family is already struggling to cover medical/hospice bills as well as the grim reality of final arrangements.

Jeff is the bravest person I have ever known and has somehow managed to confront each new trial with a smile and positive attitude, despite increasingly insurmountable odds. Jeff is truly a selfless individual who has come to accept his situation and now wishes to lessen the financial burden on his family and help other in the battle against this devastating disease. Through his struggle, culminating in this final wish, Jeff continues to serve as an inspiration to all those fortunate enough to have known him.

I have set up fundraising campaigns on both ChipIn.com and Pledgie.com but don't know how successful they will be since many of the people in our area have already chipped in what they can to help with the already daunting hospital/hospice costs. I am reaching out in hope that reddit might know of other grants or organizations out there that help with this sort of situation. Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated as we try to make Jeff's last wish a reality.
Here are the links to the campaigns:

Please Help?",alien_abductee,38,6,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/12wleh/request_wa_deaf_girl_working_five_jobs_having/,"**Update #1** She's not a redditor, so I've taken all the information you guys have given me and brought it to her yesterday (Friday).  She did the same thing as I did: hand on forehead, ""Food stamps!  Why didn't I think of that?""  She's going to get on that today.  There's another hearing for SSDI in late November, but if that fails (again) then we're going to look into Allsup (thanks for the link), since they seem pretty successful.  I don't think she wants to go in for the charity thing, and I'm not going to force the issue, but I might go talk to them anyway.  As for the CreditCare, she's *very* iffy about trusting a stranger, but I told her if we can find a hospital that will accept it, then I would do the legwork to make sure everything panned out safe and securely.  She's not denying that she could use it, just... it's hard to trust strangers right now, ya know?

-----

There's so much to her story, it's hard to pick what to tell and what to leave out.  I guess I'll start at the present and work backwards.  It may seem like a lot, but she's been through a lot.

Over the last four months, my friend has developed a *serious* breathing condition that leaves her struggling for breath, sometimes multiple times per day.  It happens fast, and leaves her audibly wheezing.  She didn't (couldn't) go to a doctor when it started, and it's been getting steadily worse.  I've been doing everything I can to help her through this.  Through trial and error, we're pretty sure it's not a food or environmental allergy, so that only leaves something internal, like asthma, or worse.  

A friend-of-mine's father is a pulmonary doctor, and agreed to see her last week and waive the portion of the fee that insurance wouldn't cover.  He ran a few tests he had in his private practice, and was left scratching his head.  Her condition doesn't match any of the normal asthma symptoms.  It's random, crippling, and ProAir inhalers do little-to-nothing to help her breath easier.  (She has to take 5+ ""hits"" of the inhaler for it to have any effect, and, one, it leaves her jittery and unable to do one of her jobs, and, two, it's close to ODing, which can kill her.)  He says that without further tests, a pulmonary xray at the least, he can only guess.  He's treating it as asthma, just in case, giving her a month of free inhaler samples, but was skeptical and really wanted further testing done just in case it was something serious...  like cancer.  Yeah.  He said it wasn't likely, but with her symptoms, it was possible.  Unfortunately, his private practice doesn't have a working xray, nor any of the equipment for the other pulmonary tests, so if we want them, we'll have to pay for them out of pocket.  That's the trouble...

She's Deaf.  Her disability makes it very hard to get by in a normal environment.  If you know Deaf, then you know how insensitive, difficult, and non-understanding some (c'mon, *most*) hearing people can be.  (You won't believe me, but we've been given Braille Menus in restaurants.  ...  Think about that for a sec.)  However, despite that, she has been repeatedly turned down for SSI assistance.  She has five part time jobs.  Four.  Some of them are incapable of promoting her to full-time due to her disability (eg: managers are required to answer phones, so she can't be bumped up to manager), and others are simply unwilling.  She is a substitute teacher at two schools, a private tutor, a safety instructor, and a retail sales clerk.  Despite having five jobs in three different cities, she still makes less than $700/mo.  It's absurd.  After rent, gas, food, and normal living expenses, she banks about $10/mo.  No, that's not a typo; she banked ten dollars last month.  (Why is it so little?  For starters, with one of the jobs, she was hired without them knowing about her disability.  Once they found out, they reduced her hours from 25 hrs/wk to about 4.  In her safety training class, the lead instructor will often times call her a half-hour or so before class begins and dismiss her, taking the shift for himself.)  To sum it all up, her ability to pay out of pocket is almost nil.

""What about insurance?"" you ask.  It's true, one of her jobs does give her health insurance, but she already used up her allotment of 70%-coverage insurance about two months ago.  A car collided with her bike and her (helmeted) head struck the hood.  He took off, and left her bleeding and with with a concussion.  It was almost an hour before we could find her (the only thing she could text me on the phone was that she was by a big cherry cafe) and take her to the ER for a cat-scan.  Not only did it eat up all the insurance, but stuck her with a $1,700 medical bill to pay off.  Now the insurance will only pay for 30% of ""approved"" procedures.

But wait, there's more.  Three days ago she got a call from HRRG.  They're a debt collection agency for hospitals.  A while back (before I met her), she was living in a small town in the South.  She was violently, brutally raped.  When she reported it to the local authorities, they didn't believe her (as they were good friends with the man who did it) and ""advised"" her to leave town, which she did, which is how I ended up meeting her.  She was crashing on someone's couch, having just fled that incident.  The guy she was crashing with had taken her to the hospital.  (The doctors there berated her, saying it was her fault for being raped.  Yes, seriously.  This is why it's like pulling teeth to get her to see *any* doctor now.  Tears, cowering in a corner, the works.  It's heart-breaking.)  This was the bill that HRRG was calling about.  Why did the bill get sent to collections, you may be wondering?  The bill from that visit wasn't sent to her current couch-crashing address, nor even her previous address in the South; they were sent to her ex-boyfriend's address in still another state (don't ask; I'll probably get back to him later).  So anyway, HRRG finally caught up with her, and now there's another $740 medical bill to pay.

At this point, with about $2,500 to pay off, *extremely* important medical tests that need to be done, and banking a whopping $10/mo, she (and I!) is doing everything possible to try and make things square.  She turned off her cell phone.  She eats once, sometimes twice a day, and only steamed vegetables and quinoa (since it's cheap and still relatively healthy).  She avoids driving whenever possible, and tries to bike to places (which is risky in itself; people get mugged in her neighborhood very frequently).  You might think, ""Well hell, I would probably start selling off my belongings if it were that bad.""  And you'd be right!  Except, remember that ex-boyfriend I mentioned?  He's the abusive type, and one night after a bad fight, she left.  Fled.  Ran away.  (That's how she ended up in that small town to the south.  See, I'm still going backwards, connecting the dots...)  He, being the fine upstanding person that he is, boxed up all her stuff, put it in his mother's attic, and has denied every effort to get her stuff back.  He won't answer emails, phone calls, in-person visits; nothing.  (She's looking into getting it solved through the courts, but not only does that take money, but she'd have to go back to that state for the proceedings, and that's not really doable right now.)  Meanwhile, all her possessions, minus some clothes and the bits and pieces she had in her car when she fled, are being held by her ex.  This girl literally doesn't own anything she could sell.

And then there's me.  I've been doing what I can for her, but it's not much.  You can check my comment history; it's not much, but it shows a couple snapshots of the high-life I'm living. [/sarc]  I've been out of work for over two years.  I've been trying to earn money freelancing, but it's not going well.  I made $5,500 last year in total.  I'm up to $3,800 for this year.  Still, I've given her about $800 to help with medical bills and living expenses, buy her food whenever I can, and am calling in every favor I can think of to try and help.  Plus, I found a guy who'll sell us cabbages and some other vegetables half-off his normal stand price, so hopefully she can start eating a little better.

And now it's come down to this.  Asking random Redditors for help.  I admit, it's taken me a few days of arguing with myself about whether I should do this, but ...  well, I don't have a lot of choices left.  The doc thinks she may have something very serious wrong with her, and we need to find out what it is.  Unfortunately, the pulmonary xray is going to cost about $200, and the other test he mentioned (I forgot the name, some sort of drug-breathing test) is somewhere between $600 and $1,000 from the hospital (the only place to get it done).  If her insurance approves it, that'll knock 30% off the total, but we're still looking at $800, give or take, just for these first rounds of tests.

For a story like this, I assume (I would hope!) that some sort of proof is in order.  I'm ...  well, I'm new to this, so I don't really know what constitutes proof.  I took a photo of her month-trial inhalers and one of the scars left over from the accident, so there's something.  Not much, I know, but something.    (\*edit\* what the hell, I'll put them up.  Links at the bottom.)  I was thinking about taking a photo of the medical bills when they come in, but that's not really ""proof"" either, since those could be found on the 'net or altered in photoshop, and all the personal information I'd have to black out (for obvious reasons).  So...  yeah, if you could give me an idea of what proof to provide, I'll do it.  I'll do just about anything at this point.

Not real good at asking, so please bear with me. Here's the story. A while back I took in a friend and her teenage son because the were a day away from being homeless. I told her that all I could do was offer her a room because I did not have the money to take care of her. Her plan was to get a job and pay her way and eventually find her own place. Didn't work out that way. For over three months I took care of her and her kid, continually telling her she needed to do more to look for work than filling out a couple of applications on line and waiting for a call back. I don't make much money at my job, and no where near enough to take care of me and four other people. My electric and water bill jumped through the roof. I pawned everything of value (my laptop, wife's wedding set...) to make sure there was gas in the car and food on the table. All the time getting more and more frustrated that I was getting no help. A few weeks ago on a Friday, I hear from her daughter she has a job. Confused me as to why her daughter, who didn't live with me, would tell me that she had a job before my ""friend"". On Saturday morning, I found out why. She announced she was moving. Saturday evening, she was gone - Out of state. Didn't even matter that she had found a job the day before. She moved in with someone who was going to take care of her so she didn't have to work. 

So, here I am. A little over three weeks after she left. My fridge is bare. I mean bare, like I have catsup and mayo left in there. Not even ramen noodles in the house. My gas light in the car is on. My front tire is bald and showing the steel belt in places. I'm about to lose my wife's wedding set. My electric is so far behind, that if I don't pay it this weekend, it will be shut off, and it's not a small bill. My water bill is two months past due with a payment arrangement for this Friday. And, I'll lose my place if I don't pay up rent Now.

I really don't know what kind of help I'm looking for or what I'm asking for. But any help would be so greatly appreciated. And Just so you so you can see I'm not just making things up...

A gas station clerk accused me of stealing and tried grabbing for my backpack.  I jerked away an left because I am afraid of people ( part of my PTSD ). I was jailed for an alleged "" shove "" and "" theft "".  Now, even though I've not been through the court system and officially convicted, I'm getting terminated from my section 8 ( HUD ) assistance because I was arrested for said battery.

I don't know what to do. I've no money or any resources to get an actual attourney.

When I was jailed I was denied my medications and almost died due to the indescribable torture and agony I was going through. I couldn't even function to use a phone, was denied my phone call, and food, and the guards just laughed at me.  I was locked naked in a padded cell when I was having panic attacks and disregarded as a piece of rubbish when I needed to get to the hospital.
My home and my cat is all I have and if I loose them I don't know what I'll do.
I've no money and no assets.  I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit with no evidence but hearsay.  

I'm in Elkhart county Indiana and have a public defender who won't do anything but bargain to have me still end up being in the system.

I feel trapped and don't know what to do.  I cannot go to jail again as it almost killed me.  

I'm about to loose everything I've ever had since I was a child because of this mess and need a way out before I seriously go through and off myself.

I don't understand this at all. I've been a victime of violent crimes many times and nobody does anything and they get away with it scott free.  Then somebody lies about me and I'm loosing everything.

I cannot even afford a decent outfit to wear to court let alone food or an attourney.

Can somebody please help me? My only other way out I can see is to off myself because I absolutely cannot go through the torture I was put through in that jail or be left in the cold.  My cat is my everything, as silly at it might sound to many of you, but she's my therapy animal and I cannot bear the thought of living on without her or my home.

I've already started preparing for my death as there seems no other option. I've never been so serious about this before in my life.

I know this post is probably kinda hard to follow and jumps around, but I'm doing my best as I'm having a horrible time focusing mentally.

I'll gladly answer any questions as to clarify what I've posted.  I need all the help I can get in this situation.

Hello. My name is Tyler, i'm 17, and I was diagnosed with SMA. Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a condition that lowers the strength of muscles to near infantile, if you have my type. Normally i'd never ask for others help with money, but we're hurting financially, and pretty significantly. 

Our wheelchair accessible van had broken down a few months back, and besides school, i've been bound to my house, completely. Only able to roll myself a few blocks down, until stopped with incredibly steep curbs. 

My dad had lost his job last year, and we've been completely living off of unemployment.

My parents are really great people, and i'm doing this for both of us. Because from my perspective, I can only begin to wonder how they feel going from being able to completely support my sister and I, to living paycheck to paycheck. They've also recently taken in one of my best friends because he had nowhere to go. 

The repairs for our current van are astronomically expensive (Engine, and electrical), so we're shooting for buying a used van, and using a program to get our current lift transferred over.

I myself have talked to countless program directors, and they've all told me the same thing. ""We can't help you get a van, but we can help you transfer your current adaptations"" 

So we're in a pretty big bind. Every single donation is deep heartedly appreciated. I put the donation at 10,000 because it'd be great to get a nice used van, but if this somehow makes it past the goal, every single cent will be put toward a better van.

I've been working as a web developer and PC tech, but the truth is I really couldn't do enough of that kind of work to make ends meet. Part of it was because I was a full time parent. Maybe I'm just not good at advertising.

For the last 2 1/2 years since my daughter was born I've been her 24/7 parent. Part of this was because my wife was working full time at a store, and I could work at home fixing computers for people and making the occasional web site for someone. These businesses became much more competitive recently when a new PC repair shop opened, and I spent so much time taking care of our daughter that I really couldn't compete well enough. I still have a few clients, but lately trying to get some of them to pay has been like pulling teeth.

The stress finally got to my wife a month ago and she left me and took our daughter. She went away to another state. I've begged her to return, but she says she'll only come back if I can find a good enough job to support her. I've been applying for jobs like crazy since then. I'm beginning to think job applications go down a black hole.

My wife also took her last paycheck from her job, which normally would have gone toward rent, so I'm even more screwed. We're already a month behind on rent, and I've used what little I had to pay the electric bill and for internet access and phone, and soon those will be overdue too. In a couple of weeks I'm pretty sure I'm going to be evicted, and then my wife won't have anywhere to come home to if she decides to come back. I miss her and my daughter terribly, and the depression is almost incapacitating, but I'm still trying.

I need to have $1,300 for rent on the first, and I need $200 for electric to keep it on. I already borrowed $650 for last month's rent, so I can't go back to my family and ask for more. They don't have it.

I feel terrible asking strangers for help, but I honestly don't know what to do any more. I'm still trying to find work, but even if I find a job it's going to be a while before I get paid.

If anyone out there actually reads these and could help me out and help me save my family and get a little more time to find a job, let me know. If you want to donate or loan some money via paypal, my paypal e-mail address is nnnslogan@yahoo.com and at this point I certainly wouldn't mind a little charity.

Also, I'm an artist, and if anyone would like a custom illustration I'd be more than happy to do that kind of work. I can draw in a variety of styles, paint, sculpt, Photoshop, do vector art with Illustrator, or even make 3-D art with 3DS Max or Mudbox. If someone wants to donate some money to me in exchange for artwork for any purpose or if anyone wants a web site, I have web space pre-paid from when I started my business.

Edit 2: Update: indiegogo seems to have removed the campaign I started. We were at ~$2100. I'm sure some haters were flagging it, but I didn't think I was violating anything in the TOS. Here's the message I sent to indiegogo:

&gt;I made the campaign: http://www.indiegogo.com/love-for-max-too to get max a new laptop. It seems to have been removed. Was I in violation of the TOS? It was only a little controversial - I'm sure people were flagging it, but there were also lots of positive responses. 

&gt;Can this campaign be restored? What would I have to do in order for that to happen?

&gt;Also - by the way - this campaign, which I believe is a bad joke: 
http://www.indiegogo.com/loveforcasetoo
Is still live... feel free to remove THAT fake campaign ASAP. Thanks

she received two fractured vertebra and a fractured pelvis. the part that really sucks is that she is the breadwinner for her family and cant pay the bills or buy food while she is recuperating.

When I first got these students in August 2011, many had never visited a college, been out of the state, or even out of the city! I was determined to change this. I promoted higher education by displaying college banners around the room, going over practice SAT and ACT questions, and having my students fill out a complete college application, including the essays. At the beginning of May, we took our first college field trip to UT Austin -- a great, nearby public school (1.5 hrs) in Austin, TX.


But if you ask my students where they dream of going to college, almost all of them will tell you: ""California."" Leaving your home state for college is normal in moderate to high income families. However, for the low-income, Title 1 students I teach, reaching these schools is tougher because their families cannot afford to expose them to these opportunities (due to managing multiple jobs, limited funds for trips, etc.).


I am setting up a field trip to the University of Southern California (my alma mater) next November. They will see what it's like to be a college freshman -- from seeing the dorms, to eating in the dining halls, to taking notes at their own private science lecture, and observing a lab with current college students. The students had to apply for the trip, and after thoughtful considerations, 20 total freshmen, sophomores, and juniors were selected.


This experience will change their lives -- but they need your help. All of my students come from low-income families who cannot afford to pay for this life changing trip. As a result, this trip will not become a reality without help.



A lot of people think these students should ""stay local"" and consider community colleges instead. Why do they have to be limited? Why is it acceptable for a child from a middle class family to move thousands of miles away for college, but the community thinks it's silly for these students to do the same? Visiting and eventually enrolling at your dream college shouldn't be something you are born into. Each child deserves to be exposed to higher education; each hardworking student deserves a chance at visiting their dream school.

Is there anyone out there that can help me?",shinjo101788,32,2,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/ttlhm/reddit_i_am_at_the_end_of_my_rope_is_there_anyone/,"Edit: I [cross-posted](http://redd.it/ttxdk) to /r/Askreddit as per your advice.

I am a 23 year old male that has been living with constant pain, and other ailments, for roughly five years now.  It has gotten to the point where the pain is too much to bear which has made living more of a chore than an enjoyable experience.  I come to you, Reddit, with hopes that someone out there would be able to offer me some form of help, an answer to my supplication for some reprieve from this pain.  I am a foster child, I have been since the age of 12, and have aged out of the system.  I essentially have nobody and I feel incredibly alone and scared.  I have been going to counseling to help cope with my symptoms, but the sessions only serve to shed more light on how grim and hopeless my situation is - it makes me realize that it would be better for me to end things myself as opposed to living in constant pain.  I am bound by my own cowardice, however, and could never see myself doing something like that, but lately my suicidal thoughts have become more vivid for me.  Every second of every day I am in pain and I am suffering; I do not wish to live like this, it is literally torture.



About 5 years ago I developed really bad migraine headaches out of the blue.  The headaches were not that bad, and they were manageable with Tylenol.  However, the headaches gradually increased in severity, ultimately turning in to a debilitating ailment.  Initially, the pain would occur in the area of my forehead and would be accompanied by a strong pressure and pain sensation in the back of my right eye.  I saw a neurologist for the pain, and was prescribed some Atenolol (50mg Daily) to help manage the pain - this did not work at all.  It is important to note that early on my headache episodes were intermittent, but have now graduated to always being present.  



Roughy six months went by and I did not get better, things got worse in fact.  I distinctly remember jogging on the basketball court and being overcome with a shooting pain in my head (mainly the crown of my head) which felt as if it were coming out of my veins.  I was paralyzed by this pain and was frozen for about 30 seconds.  During this time, my vision became blurred and my whole body was stiff.  A short time after the aforementioned pain episode, I had a similar experience after going for a jog.  I came home and right when I was going to take off my shirt to go take a shower, I was overcome with an extreme feeling of dizziness and my vision, again, became blurred.  I distinctly remember my vision being blurred because I was looking at my alarm clock just as I was about to take off my shirt, the numbers immediately transitioned from being legible to a big red blur.



It was at this point where my headaches developed into a constant pain, that never went away.  I would always have a dull feeling of pain and pressure in between my eyebrows, which resonated through the roof of my mouth and to the crown of my head - this is still present to this day.  A few weeks after my dizzy episodes I caught a cold that lasted about a week.  This cold was memorable for me in that after I recovered from this cold, my headaches were exacerbated to the point where I could not do anything anymore, and my sense of taste and smell were severely affected by the pain.  As it stands now, my sense of taste and smell share an inverse relationship with the pain and pressure I feel in my head - the more pain and pressure I feel, the less I am able to taste and smell.



This was where I became worried that something was seriously wrong with me.  I went to see countless specialists ranging from ENT’s, neurologists, rheumatologists, dentists, allergists, and chiropractors. I have had, so far, two sinus surgeries - bilateral turbinate reduction and septoplasty, which both did not help my pain or my sense of taste and smell.  I have been on countless regimens of antibiotics, narcotics, and special diets - none of which has worked for me.  A couple of months ago I was prescribed Nortiptyline (30mg Daily) (50mg Daily) (75mg Daily) which did not work for me despite the increases in dosage.  The neurologist I saw thought I had a bad case of migraines and said the medication would act as a preventative measure, after five months of no change, I gave up that avenue as well.


I recently saw a dentist that said two of my teeth, tooth seven and tooth eight, were infected and needed to be removed.  The dentist was confident that the pain that I am experiencing was coming from my teeth.  Hoping that this was the answer I have been waiting for, in an act of desperation I agreed to the extraction which has also done nothing for me.  Being sick of all the failed attempts to find a correct diagnoses and a chance at living a normal life again, I went to Syracuse Upstate Medical’s Headache Clinic for a possible answer - this was a week and a half ago.  I told the neurologist about my symptoms and updated them on how the symptoms have developed.  As it stands right now, I have pain and pressure in between my eyebrows (above my nose) that is always present and that fluctuates in severity.  The pain then resonates to the roof of my mouth, into my eyes (which now have a burning sensation), and to the crown of my head.  Accompanying this pain is sometimes, not always, a combination of a runny, stuffy nose, and tearing of my eyes - the former is more common than the latter.  Within the past year, I have been to the ER for conjunctivitis in both eyes and for a stye in my right eye a combination of 14 times.  I was tentatively diagnosed with Hemicrania Continua and was prescribed Indomethacin (50mg 2X Daily) to possibly help with the pain and confirm the diagnosis.



I was so happy that I had some form of an answer that made sense and was consistent with my symptoms.  I started the Indomethacin last Tuesday and it has only served to harm me, not help in any way.  I have extreme abdominal pains now, and I have been having trouble moving my bowels.  It has now been a week and a half of the Indomethacin treatment and there is still no signs of improvement.  I don’t know what else to do.  I don’t want to continue to live like this.  I literally spend all of my leisure time in bed writhing in pain, only to get up to fulfill my responsibilities as a CS graduate student and TA.  Despite all of my ailments, I still am able to maintain a 4.0 GPA - I literally live to do school work, nothing more.  This is no way for me to live and I can’t see myself going on like this much longer.  I have no enjoyment in my life and every single moment I am alive I am suffering and am in pain.  I am constantly being strung along with diagnosis, after diagnoses, which never seem to materialize to anything.  I am alone and scared and have reached the point where my level of discouragement has reached its precipice - I just feel like giving up.  I have worked hard for everything in my life and fear that I will not be able to support myself if I continue to be ill.



If there is anyone out there that can offer me some help, I would be forever in your debt.  I don’t mind taking out a loan to pay for a corrective surgical procedure, no matter how invasive it may be - I just want my life back.  I honestly don’t remember what it is like to life without pain, I just want this chapter of my life to be over with.  I feel as if my whole life has been on pause because of this debilitating mystery illness that has taken everything away from me. Please feel free to send me a PM, reply to this post, or forward this around if you have any idea what may be wrong with me or if you know of any way I can be helped - I will be sure to look at every comment sent to me.  From the deepest depths of my heart, and with the utmost sincerity, thank you Reddit.

(Xpost)",GreatSince86,37,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/nlpc5/reddit_i_need_your_help_xpost/,"  Reddit, on this time of year only days before Christmas and just over a week before the New Year… I come asking for assistance. Not for myself, but for my family. Honestly, as I’m just starting to type this I am already tearing up from what has been a horrible month for my family. I’m asking for two types of assistance for them… monetary and advice. My step-father Bill and my mother Pam decided two years ago they were going to try for their dream. They had the crazy idea to move out to the Peoria, Illinois from the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area and open and sandwich shop similar to that of Pat’s or Geno’s. Now my father (from this point on I will refer to him as such because he’s the only real father I have known) was born and bred in the Philadelphia area and he bleeds all things Phillies and Eagles. So naturally, he named his shop Billy’s Philly’s. My parent’s put their heart and soul into this little shop not too far from the city. Shipping in meat from Philadelphia weekly and rolls from Amoroso in Philadelphia, for their business to be unique. Business finally started to take off and they were making tons of money which they just turned around and put right back into the business. 

   Well, about 6 months ago business took a turn for the worse, as it often does in this economy. My father is a carpenter and has been his entire life. He made enough money for my mother to raise 5 kids and stay at home and keep the house together when he lived in Philadelphia (where I’m at now). As business started slowing down they started to realize the inevitable, that they were going to have to close up shop. For two years, business went up and down and they loved every high and low… but closing that place broke their hearts. But as my parents are very strong people they moved on and naturally my father with his new found popularity in the Peoria area, found a job rather quick. Which was needed since they had sunken almost everything they had into their dream (which after taking loses on selling out house here and other financial problems from passing relatives, wasn’t that much). 


   Not long after is when a series of such horrible events happen that it would almost seem impossible for such a travesty to happen to such good people. My mother who has had a series of brain tumors in her life, all which required surgery had needed another surgery. Which they had put off but this time they couldn’t put it off further. It was for a splint and removing massive amounts of scar tissue amongst other things. Now, my mom is a trooper and she handles these surgeries in the way that would make you think “Whoa, we got a badass over here.” But not in the rage comic sarcastic sense, but in the real life sense.The incident happened the day she came home after surgery, it came with a single phone call. My father had been into an accident and was in route to the nearest hospital. He had apparently fallen off a ladder, which my mom thought couldn’t be that bad… how she couldn’t have been more wrong. Hours go by and my mother still has no details until finally my father gets ahold of her and is in tears. 


   He had what was called an upper pilon fracture. Now, I personally had never heard of such a thing. After looking around google and trying to get help with the details, I found very little. My father has been in the union all his life and had even said before if this had been Philadelphia they would have hung him for such a practice. They retained a lawyer and spoke to him just yesterday. His consensus wasn’t very promising at all. I don’t like asking for help, but I have nowhere else to turn to at this point. I recently lost my job, but am ok myself for a couple of months. My parents don’t know what to do or where to turn in this matter. My mother can’t work for some time and my father certainly can’t and they have NOT received any kind of workman’s comp checks in anyway. The boss my dad works for is apparently shady, and doesn’t even pay into some members benefits the way he’s supposed to.


   Now, my father was born with clubbed feet and had something like 20 surgeries to correct that when he was very young. So, the anatomy of his feet and shins is more complicated than the average person. This would make any type of damage to this area that much worse. This happened at the end of November, and they basically used what they had had left to put food on the table for my younger brother and sister and pay Decembers mortgage and utilities. My mother just told me, as my father is in surgery that they only have 13 dollars in the bank and she has no idea what they are going to do. Now, my father was injured on a union job, so you would think that he would be entitled to his full amount of benefits? Apparently, this is not so and he is only going to be entitled to 80% of 30 hours of his rate due to how the person he was working for did things. Apparently, he paid my father by check for 30 hours then by cash for 10, of which he was still apparently taking taxes out of apparently (or so my father thought. Now, I don’t believe anything in life comes for free… so for every 500 dollars for my family that is donated I will personally volunteer 40 hours at various (even your choice) shelters or with community projects throughout the city. For every 1000 dollars donated I will not only volunteer 80 total hours, but I have a 1000 person Meetup group which I will schedule 1 major volunteer event per month. I cannot guarantee how many will come out but I can guarantee it will be at least 10 people. Their hours will not count towards mine.


   I am attaching some pictures that I myself have been too afraid to look at. I will e-mail the medical documents to a mod or post them. Whichever is necessary. I am unfamiliar with how the donation process works, but the paypal account that has been setup for this is greatsince86@yahoo.com. Also, any advice on this matter is greatly appreciated. My parents will donate anything not needed to a local charity.


 TLDR: Mother underwent brain surgery, day she got home my father had a debilitating work injury (pilon fracture) and since he was born with clubbed feet that were surgically corrected it’s led to complications. Thirteen dollars in the bank and Workman’s com complications leave them going nowhere fast. I will set up a Twitter account to track my volunteer progress if people would like that. When I return to work, I will continue to volunteer. It just may only be on weekends.

Thank you guys. The short story is that Loki ate a ton of string which destroyed her insides. Thanks to some amazing doctors and nurses she has survived so far. Unfortunately her intestines are still not functioning.


Loki was rescued when she was a tiny little baby, along with her two sisters. Her mother had died, and the little babies were found by my boyfriend. He taught them to eat, to drink, and basically was and is their mother. She and her sisters are 6 years old now.


We noticed her withdrawing and not eating (she is a very social cat and loves to eat). We took her to the vet and they found that she had string basically cinching her intestines together into a tiny little ball. After a six hour surgery all of the string was removed. They had to cut her stomach open once, intestines 6 times, and repair two lacerations that the string had made.


Since then she has been touch and go. Her pancreas is in very bad shape from the string and the surgery, causing her not to eat which is slowing her recovery. They have taken her off the pain medication, and she was looking okay today - eyes open, purring, looking around. She is in a bad way but still has a 50% chance of making it if they can treat her pancreas and get her intestines processing food.


If we can afford to keep her in the hospital, we have a good chance of bringing her home. We want to do everything we can, but already our credit (every form we could get) is maxed out. We love Loki so much. If we can make it through these next couple of days, we can have our baby home and happy.

i have never been able to silence my pride long enough to be able to reach out for help. i've been too proud. i've told myself over &amp; over again how many other people have it worse than me. sometimes, when there is no food on the table and i have to hold my children, promising that today will be better, i lose sight of that and wish for so much more.

i am doing all i can with the least amount of help possible. i work full time, i take online college courses instead of sleeping, i spend every free moment with the children who see me though this mess. i have ""side hustles"" which bring in a bit more income but as usual, it's never enough. i am doing everything i can to get out of this cycle of poverty and we get closer everyday. 

i go to food banks, i cut coupons. if it is not on sale, it isn't an option. this has been working and now, it is not. we are hungry all the time. i am fine being hungry. the twins aren't and they just don't understand why other people have food but we do not. they are too young to ""get it"" and sometimes, i am glad for that.

i recently applied for food stamps but the government doesn't live in my shoes and is in no rush to help. oh well. soon, we will be okay but not soon enough.

this is where i swallow my pride because i am out of options at the moment.

would anyone out there who has been blessed with a bit extra be willing to provide a bit for food for my little ones until the food stamps get worked out? i imagine we will get them within 2 weeks or less.
in return, i will pay you back with interest. with that said, a payment plan would be best for me but beggars cannot be choosers. i am willing to pay interest as well. i'd also be happy to send post dated checks to further place trust in me. i know it may seem strange of me to ask reddit for help but, honestly i have no where else to turn for now. 

here is a screencap of my current funds in the bank, which is all the money we have until i figure things out or until my partial paycheck comes on feb. 11th:
http://i.imgur.com/uv3HX.png  - i can provide any proof you'd like, too. just ask what'd you like to see.

http://imgur.com/a/QgpaM

using my name which is readable on the pictures of the paperwork, you can find me on facebook. send a request and i'll add you. i am an open book.

this is a throwaway account but only due to the fact that i would rather my ex does not get the satisfaction of seeing us suffer. please feel free to PM me and i will share my main account name.

if you got this far, i thank you from the bottom of my strugglin' mama heart.

tl;dr: single mama from seattle with 7 year old twins has nowhere else to turn and could really use a helping hand for a bit. 

my shame? it's out the window, i have never ever been so desperate. i am in survival mode sooo, here goes.

1362260024.0,28,self.Assistance,19jiff,"I have been alienated from my daughter for over a month.  My ex-husband has been withholding visitation and screening my texts and calls.  I am on a fixed income, and desperately missing my child.",LolTurdFerguson,39,11,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/19jiff/i_have_been_alienated_from_my_daughter_for_over_a/,"This is a very long and drawn out tit-for-tat that has been happening for over 6 years, so I will spare everyone the mundane details.

Basically, three years ago, I was in a very bad place in my life.  I was facing foreclosure, and my husband and I were stuck financially.  My ex husband swooped in like a vulture, and saw his chance to finally relinquish custody from me.

I was presented with a temporary custody order (and assured by his lawyers and himself) that it would ONLY be temporary, and I could change it at ANY time.

At that time, I was awarded ""any and all reasonable visitation"" and my ex husband was awarded 64 dollars a week in child support (even though I was jobless and facing enormous financial issues).  I was seeing my daughter every weekend, and even a few days during the week, she would sleep over my house and I would transport her to school.

My ex husband assured me I didn't have to pay the child support (he was working a Government job and making a ton of money, as was his current wife).  He only asked for help with school clothes and expenses (which I obliged, willingly and happily).  

I didn't pay him the child support (which was never ordered through DHR, only through a divorce agreement).  Now, I am in a world of crap because of it.

Fast forward last year.  He started to become VERY bitter towards me (with no specific reason given).  He started talking bad about me to my daughter (she would confide in me, crying and sobbing about how she is NOT allowed to speak of me in their house, or her other sisters).
Then, he cut down my visitation to every OTHER weekend.  

He said it was because she was ""tired"" for school.  Unfortunately, that is the standard issued schedule for visitation in Alabama.  I had to comply.

Last month, my daughter contracted head lice from her school.  A notice was sent home, and unfortunately, it had spread to my other children and myself.  Not a big deal.  We got the infestation under control, and everything seemed to be going smoothly.  

My husband called me and told me ""we need to talk"".  I know what this means.  He is a severe control freak.  He continued to berate me and tell me that the lice infestation was originating at my house.  I, of course, rebuffed that claim and told him that we were all, indeed, lice free.  He refused to believe me, so I got 3 different written statements and head inspections on my entire family.  One was by our family pediatrician.

Still a no go.  He refuses to let her come to my house.  Without any reason.  

He uses material possessions to bribe her.  Giving her things I could never afford.  Dangling things like new game systems and kindle's in her face.

He told me he will NOT let me see my daughter, unless it is supervised visitation by HIM, and on his terms.  He even went so far as to say that his current wife needs ""alone"" time with my daughter to ""bond"".  (Forgetting that I am, indeed, her biological mother, and very much would like have that sort of privilege with my own flesh and blood.)

He also stated that he would NOT tell me the reason, until we both had legal representation.  

Whenever I tell him that his withholding of visitation is illegal (I am a certified Paralegal..I've dealt with this before), he just throws the child support in my face.  

So, I spoke to a lawyer, who really WANTS to take my case.  He says that he will even help get my child support order revised due to my financial hardship.

The bummer?  It will cost 1,500 dollars for the retainer.  

So I come here, mainly to vent, to escape all of this off my chest.  The feeling of not being able to hug my daughter, or see her infectious smile is indescribable.  It is like she has died to me.  I am unable to contact her (except for her 1 sentence texts she sends me when she can), and I just have this gaping hole in my heart.

My husband has been in my daughters life since she was two years old.  She is now 11.  He misses her just as much as I do.  My other children cry for her.  This is unfair, unjust and too much to handle.

I came here to see if I could receive ANY assistance (whether monetary, a word of encouragement, or even a ""I know the feel"").  I just feel so so lost, and so down.

Being poor feels like a prison.  The only thing I can offer my daughter is my unconditional love.  But according to my ex husband, that isn't worth shit.

**Update** - I decided to be a bit ballsy and ask my ex if I could take my daughter out to lunch (with my mother and other children present, of course).  He replied that he does not feel comfortable letting my daughter go anywhere with me. 

The only way I can see her is if I visit her on his porch.  This is such bullshit!  

**Update 2** - Legal Services rejected my application for help.  They rely on Federal funding, and have told me, basically, that they will not waste their time with my situation.  They did tell me, however, that if I had criminal charges, it would be a different story.  *sigh*.

After some helpful redditors, I managed to survive a suicidal mindset last night an am moving on to finding a way through this.

I just moved to Jacksonville, FL for work in December, but last week the contract fell through when the entertainment company went bankrupt. The apartment owner I was subletting from kicked me out last night after I explained I would not be able to pay on time. It was a risk coming here but that's how life goes.

At any rate, I am very suddenly homeless in a city I know very little about. I have never been homeless before nor have I been without funds and such so I'm discovering I have no idea how to cope or live. I had a breakdown last night but am attempting to pull shot together today. 

If anyone in the area knows of places I can contact for shelter/food I would be greatful. Or any general homeless tips. I know nothing. I've gotten on a waiting list to two shelters, but it can be up to 60 days before that works. I'd like to be able to nab a job soon (I can do design work, construction, theatre tech, home repairs, ect) but the market her is hard to get a read on.

Feel free to message me with questions or advice or political rants about the homeless problem. I'll also accept just people to talk to. The loneliness is rough. I've still got my phone through March, so Internet and calls are at my fingertips, so I should be able to answer relatively quickly.

Thanks.

Edit/Update:  thanks so much for your advice everyone! So far I've managed a semi permanent spot at a shelter, and have located places that all together provide three square meals a day. A local barista I was friendly with pre-homeless heard about my situation and the coffee shop has been providing coffee, a few pastries and a place to sit and Internet. Someone local might be pulling together a care package as well but haven't hear from them yet.  I was approved yesterday for a local program that can provide up to 90 days lodging plus work an food for that time period that could allow me the ability to get the money to move away. I meet with them today. To be honest, I am so far finding the local programs very nice and VERY willing to help those who are helping themselves. However I've also encountered a darker side of things, but I'll stay away from that.  Thanks for all the help my friends, I may be contacting some of you for questions, hopefully with today's meetings and possible care packages, my life will be in order.

Im asking for help with £200 to get into the house.

 I need to come up with a months rent in advance which is £425. An application fee plus reservation fee which is £300 for the both. I have received a help from a lovely anon helper so im much closer to my goal.

I understand this is alot of money. I was going to post on r/loans but i have no idea how long it will take me to pay that amount back.
Im not sure what i can do to verify.. ill do anything. Call you, you call me, give you the address, takes pictures, show you bills, my facebook... anything you can think off.

 I want so much to have a fresh start.


If you felt able to drop anything at all my my paypal account it would be gratefully appreciated and paid forward as soon as I am able.

He is an international student (from the UK) who studies medicine. 

He was out celebrating New Years Eve with some friends at a nightclub in Budapest called Ötkert, at around 1 am in the morning he walked away from his group and has not been seen since. The event has been reported in the news:

Both Hungarian and British police are searching for him, as well as his group of friends in Budapest and in the UK. They have tried tracing him via his Smartphone, however it is switched off and the last time it was traceable was on the very night he went missing.  

Apparently this is some cctv footage of him walking away from the nightclub:

So, I'm really in a bad spot and could use all the advice I can get.

My girlfriend and I, along with our 3 cats and dog Just moved over 2000 miles from Charlottesville Virginia to Helper Utah. I had lined up an awesome place to live in an old theater/hotel built in the 20s... in a tiny little town right in the center of all kinds of parks and cool places. The old hotel had been completely gutted and refinished with all modern appliances, tile kitchen and bath, gorgeous wood floors, over 1000sq ft... awesome place to live...

Not so much. [This is what we found the night we pulled into town.](http://imgur.com/a/zKoc5) No walls, floors, toilet... not even running water. The electrical and wiring were just finished the day before we got there.

I should say that the arrival date was confirmed many times over the last 2 months and I was assured in every possible way that the apartment would be ready and waiting. In addition to it being completely unfinished and unlivable its also about half the size promised.

We went from riding a super-happy-high of finally getting to our new place after a long drive to super depressed and thinking we'd possibly made the biggest mistake of our lives. There was a single room provided (with no airflow or AC) in the rest of the hotel with an old lumpy mattress that we and all our animals were supposed to live in till the apartment was done. est time to completion ""about 2 weeks""

This room had holes in the walls, doors that didn't shut properly, no window screens so we couldn't open them for air with the cats being forces to live in there... really a nightmare.

Luckily I have family down in Moab so we put all our stuff in a 10x20 storage locker and drove about 2 hours south to see my sister and my mom who both live in town. We're essentially ""couch surfing"" with all our pets and some clothes in suit cases till we can find a place to live.

The #1 issue we've run into is finding a half way decent place that allows pets. We have a few prospects but they aren't available till October at the earliest. 

We just put an ad in the local paper that comes out tomorrow hoping someone who sees it will have a place. We've been through pretty much all of the local realty companies and haven't had any luck yet.

I'm an independent web developer and have plenty of work right now. Keeping my clients happy is crucial so my girlfriend is handling most of the house-hunting so I can sit at the kitchen table and get work done on time. So at least I still have the ability to continue working through this. Far different from being able to move in and set up my home office though.

We spent most of the cash we had on the initial plan (truck rental, lots of gas, motels across the country, etc) so I'm doing my best to make enough money quickly that we can put down a security deposit on a new place, first months rent and then rent a new truck to move our stuff out of storage ~120 miles away and into the new place.

So, I don't really know what I expect to hear back on this. Partially I just wanted to share the story and be able to vent a bit. I'm also hoping someone might have a brilliant idea of how we could look for places or maybe someone in Moab will read this and know someone who is renting a nice place. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. I'm open to any ideas that might help us get out of this mess. I'll update if I think of anything else relevant.

Just for fun... [here are some instagram pics of our kitties and puppy](http://imgur.com/a/xw7Ol)

**Edit:** Yes it was *family* who did this to us. Yes I will still try to get whatever money I can back... even via court if it comes to that.

**Edit from comment below:** We did have a rental agreement and would have paid rent though so it's not like he was ""helping us out"" or anything. Just renting us a place at regular market value. Additionally we didn't have to leave the place we were in for like 6 more months if we didn't want to. We LOVED it in VA but decided to move because it seemed like a great/cool opportunity to explore a new place. The land we lived on in VA was going to be sold but if we liked the new owners we could have stayed there indefinitely.

1342883813.0,29,self.Assistance,wxbm9,"I'm a full-time single dad and computer science major looking for a cheap apartment in San Francisco. I see them on Craigslist, but most people don't like kids. (Not asking for money or hand-outs.)",,35,6,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/wxbm9/im_a_fulltime_single_dad_and_computer_science/,"So, every time I call someone about an apartment - usually studios or one-bedrooms because I can only afford a *maximum* of $1300 (but $950-$1200 is better) - I ask what the maximum occupancy is if it's not specified on the ad. If it's two people, I continue. I give a short summary of who I am, and the second I mention that I'm a parent, the tone of the conversation changes completely. Suddenly the apartment that's suitable for two college students is too small for one college student and a child. 

We've lived in Berkeley, Oakland, and even Hayward; I don't like any of those places. I lived in San Francisco before my daughter was born up until her mom (whom I was no longer seeing at the time) told me she was pregnant (it's a long story... we had been broken up for a few months and the last time we were intimate was a month before the break-up. She left us almost two years ago and has been a flake ever since). 

All I want to do is go back to San Francisco. I don't want to live anywhere else. My daughter loves it too. I'm not sure if that's only from me hyping it up so much or if it's truly her own opinion. We've gone there a lot just to hang out. She likes the buildings, the people bustling about, the cool buildings, the beach, the parks, etc.. I want her to grow up in a city, not in a suburb. I grew up in a suburb. I know it's ""safe"" and more affordable and all of that, but I want her to grow up with all of the positive and negative aspects of city life. If you live in a city by choice, then you know what I mean. If you live in the suburbs and think I should too, then please stop reading this. And please don't suggest that we move to the suburbs. I want to be in San Francisco because I love it, and it's a great place to be for someone pursuing a career in programming. 

I'm beginning to feel defeated. I've been calling and emailing people with studios and one-bedrooms that are explicitly said to be suitable for two people and I can't even get to the application process because these people all seem to be anti-children. They haven't even asked how old she is! One person even questioned whether I have custody or not. And when I do get to the application process, despite my excellent references, rental history, and that my mom is even willing to sign the lease and pay a small portion of my rent to make this happen, I have bad credit (no bankruptcies, evictions or foreclosures, just unpaid bills in collections).

We've always lived in one-bedroom apartments. My daughter has the bedroom to herself and I have the living room with a futon. She never used her room besides for sleeping. A studio wouldn't be a stretch at all for us as long as it's not a glorified storage room.

I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of posting in /r/Assistance... ideas, hook ups, maybe someone has a house with an in-law apartment they can give us first dibs on. I'm just sick of this crap. 

We're visiting with my parents in Florida for a few weeks. When we go back, we're staying with a friend and her kid in their two-bedroom in Berkeley until we can get a place. I'm trying to take care of this before school starts so I don't have to change her schools after the first week or two.

I'll try to keep an eye on this thread throughout the day if anyone responds, but I can't sit at the computer waiting so I can respond immediately.

**update** 

Found this http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/catenant.pdf

&gt;Brown, Warner and Portman, The California Landlord’s Law Book, Vol. I: Rights &amp; Responsibilities, pages 166-167 (NOLO Press 2009). 
&gt;This reference suggests that a landlord’s policy that is more restrictive than two occupants per bedroom plus one additional occupant is suspect as being discriminatory.



&gt;Section 503(b), the maximum number of people in a rental unit is determined by square footage. Each dwelling must have at least one room 120 square feet or more and all other habitable rooms excluding the kitchen must be at least 70 square feet. If a room is used for sleeping by more than two people, then the minimum square footage must be increased by 50 square feet for each additional person. For example, if three people were using a room to sleep, it would have to be at least 120 square feet. If four people were sleeping in one room, it would have to be at least 170 square feet.

Thanks everyone who responded. I'm sure none of this will win any discriminating landlords over, but it's good to have it as a defensive measure.

I pulled over and ran back to get him, but he got scared, started running away from me, and was hit by a car. I was able to rescue him during a break in the traffic. The state police said it would be at least an hour until the humane society would mobilize someone to get him. Rather than wait I put him in the back of my car, and within 20 minutes he was on the table at an emergency vet clinic nearby.

I've paid for a first round of x-rays and his treatment overnight. He has a shattered left rear femur, tibia, AND fibula, and the vet is planning to amputate on Friday morning after he's more stable. He doesn't seem to have any internal injuries.

Reddit, the vet says surgery could be upwards of $2k; I'm already in $800 for last night's care.  They estimate he's only five, he was wearing a nice collar, and I'm sure he's someone's pet. The vet has alerted the shelters in case the owner calls for him, but in the meantime, I promised him that I wouldn't make any decisions based on the expense.

I asked the vet if people could call to make donations for Buck's treatment, but they said no. They suggested that I collect donations and then pay them, so that's what I'm doing. You can head to [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com) and send money to my account ID, matt@writingworksltd.com. I will NOT profit from this. Please give what you can so that we can save this beautiful dog. I promise full transparency; I will update with receipts for his care, and any donations in excess of that amount will be donated to the emergency vet who is treating him--they've already offered to operate at their cost. Please help!

Update: Thanks so much to each of you for your help with our four-legged friend over the last two days.  I'm sincerely touched by your generosity, whether you made a donation, helped to spread the word, or sent some positive thoughts his way.

Last night I had a call that Buck--who is actually named Toby, it turns out--had been reunited with his family.  They said he had run away from their home near Emmaus late Wednesday afternoon, but they were able to track him down through the local veterinary grapevine.

Sadly, it seems our story won't have the happy ending we were hoping for.  A minute ago I learned that ultrasounds this morning revealed a cluster of masses in Toby's chest, which apparently could have been the reason he ran away in the first place.  His owners have decided to put him down this afternoon.  The silver lining, I suppose, is that they will be with him in the end.

Thank you all once again for your help and support.  In just over 24 hours, you came forward with almost $600, which I understand will just about offset the expense of caring for him these last two days.

I'm trying to make this short:

I need YOUR help, do you know anybody who lives in Atlanta,Georgia area and might need or know someone who needs an Au Pair?

Here is my story:
I always wanted to go to the states, but didn't know such thing as au pair existed so I went as a rgular tourist and found out about it there so I decided I want to do it too. In the states I met my now boyfriend, so now I dont only want to go to the US but especially to Atlanta.
I am signed up at an agency and everything, but it only works one way, host families look for au pairs, I as an au pair cant search for host families. So waiting until a family from Atlanta picks me seems long, but I thought it'll be ok.
My boyfriends mom has stage 4 lung cancer and yesterday we got the worst news from the doctors you could imagine:
The cancer has spread all over her body, also in the brain. There are no chances of healing and they're quitting the chemo therapy. 
I am terrified to not make it back to the US in time to see her again.
(Since I travelled back and forth between US and Germany a lot lately, I got stuck in customs twice becuse i am simply there too much and they told me the next few months I shouldnt try flying in unless I have a visa, because they probably wont let me in).

I beg you all for your help, spread this message, help me make as many peopple as possible see this post and if you ask around neighbors, friends, coworkers, family... whoever you know. If they know someone who needs an au pair in atlanta area please contact me.

Thank you so much.  Here's a [little video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYXeN7POSdg) with Edge.

**Goal Met!**

There's supposed to be a button for meeting the goal, but I don't see it.  Anyway, we're there, $718.  I was told the second, and then the first, and now a volunteer thinks the 31st.  Regardless which it is, I'll be able to bring him home.  Someone requested a photo when I get him back.  I'll do one better, and put up an unlisted video on my YouTube channel and link it here.

**Deadline: June 2**

I have created a [page](http://www.gofundme.com/32d210) on GoFundMe.

I live in Mesa, Arizona.

Last Thursday, I took my dog, Edge, for a walk to my local convenience store. When we arrived, I tied him to a tree as I have many times before and went inside to get a soda and hot dogs.

While I was inside, according to witnesses, some guy approaches Edge. Edge goes defensive. The guy put his hand in Edge's face. Understandably, Edge bit his hand.

Suddenly, what had been a peaceful half hour walk to the store for a $3 snack became a 10 day quarantine for Edge followed by a cost of over $700 to get him back all because of a single moment of stupidity by a random stranger.

I think in fairness the guy who approaches unsupervised dogs that he doesn't know should be the one responsible for any associated costs. However, life isn't fair, so I'm stuck with this huge and sudden expense.

If I can't pay it on June 2, Edge will be killed... for no good reason.

I hope you will make life a little more fair for Edge and I and help return him home.

With all gratitude, Edge's friend, Brian.

But, unfortunately, his kidneys are failing and he's been given a life expectancy of a few months. So he should be dead before this year. He is an out-of-work artist with no health insurance so he can't afford dialysis or a transplant and because he has such little time left, he doesn't take care of himself at all. 

His doctor has told him that without health insurance, pretty much the only chance he has left is to go to India and get a transplant there. Now, he's the type of person who won't even bother looking into it, he knows he can't afford it and he's perfectly at peace with his mortality and is always happy and smiling and laughing. He's basically accepted the fact that he'll be dead before Christmas and he's ok with that. But goddammit I'm not. 

I've been trying to do some research about the price of a kidney transplant in India but I haven't been able to find any concrete information. Estimates range from $15k to over $90k. I have heard it's significantly cheaper for locals and luckily I have some family there, one of whom is actually a doctor. I'm hoping my great-uncle, the doctor, will be able to get him fast-tracked for a kidney and maybe even ensure he doesn't get ""rich foreigner prices."" But I'm really not sure about anything, I haven't seen that side of my family since I was a baby, so essentially never, and I don't know if he'll even consider helping the friend of a distant relative. Either ways, I'd like to get as much information as possible before bringing this up to him. 

I didn't know where else to turn and I'm not even sure what I'm asking for here, money or just some detailed information if anyone has had a similar procedure in India or knows how the process works would be lovely. I realize it'll be near impossible to raise a hundred grand in a few months and I'm not expecting anything to come of this post except maybe some kind words but if anyone can make magic happen, it's all you wonderful redditors. If you have any information that can help my friend, please please get back to me, he doesn't have much time and I'm not letting him go out without a fight. Thank you so much everybody!

 Living in Windsor, Ontario

My mom, she is a truly amazing person; she always does her best for everyone around her. For the past 5 years she has volunteered her time with my sister’s parent council. She has been chair person for 3 of those years. My mom has always been the person to go to whenever you’re in need. It doesn’t matter who you are or what your story is, she’s there to help. Unfortunately, this year my mom needs help. She has lost the Christmas spirit. On December 20, 2011, my father left our family to move in with his girlfriend. He had cheated on my mom for the better part of 6 years. We barely made it through the holiday season last year, and this year I fear it is even worse. Between me and my mom, we barely make enough money to get by, let alone by gifts for my brother (16) and sister (10). That’s with me working 2 jobs; I do what I can to help out but I know that I can never replace the husband she had. He was not just her spouse, but her best friend. Please note; she doesn’t know I’m writing you. I just don’t know what to to do anymore or how I can help make Christmas good again. It used to be her favourite time of year, she told me the other day that she hates Christmas. I’m only asking for something small and simple. A gift for my siblings.

I own a very small bath and body company. We recently changed our lip balm recipe slightly and as a result, I have a block of lip balm base weighing almost 6 pounds that we can't sell. It's 100% usable, handmade by artisans with high quality ingredients. I'd love to dispense these into completed balms and donate them to either a homeless or women's shelter. The problem is, I can't afford the out-of-pocket expense of the packaging.

Here is a (terrible quality) [**pic of the block!**](http://i.imgur.com/0FWFF.jpg) This bad boy is 94 oz, which would make 626 lip balms. This project requires:

- [Labels](http://www.onlinelabels.com/OL1102.htm?src=dlc-119): 52 pages plus shipping, $23.90

If we could get even half of the total $134.27, I think it would make a lot of folks in need out there more comfortable this winter season. I live near Seattle, WA, so there are plenty of organizations nearby that would be happy to distribute these. [YouthCare](http://www.youthcare.org/) is a great one we've worked with in the past.

1353007396.0,26,self.Assistance,1395x5,Have you ever wanted to own a painting of a sloth and do something nice in the process?,goodizzle,33,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1395x5/have_you_ever_wanted_to_own_a_painting_of_a_sloth/,"Hi. Here's the thing: 

You may not know me, but you might've seen my son around here as [Frodo](http://i.imgur.com/qy5fl.jpg) and as a suave little [Tony Stark](http://i.imgur.com/lKLEG.jpg). I'm a college art student.

Now, about the [sloth painting](http://i.imgur.com/jvvx8.jpg). Many of my friends didn't know this until this semester, but I have a phobia of sloths. Which makes it difficult to be on Reddit sometimes. Especially with redditor friends, who love posting the pictures I avoid onto my Facebook page (all in good fun.. sort of). 

Why sloths? I don't know. I had a night terror about E.T. when I was 3 years old, so maybe it evolved from there. I thought painting the sloth for my Phobia assignment in class would help, but now I just want him out of my house. And if I can help a friend in the process, I would be ecstatic.

One of my best friends recently had a [baby named Faron](http://imgur.com/a/uBTH4) who, at just under 2 months old, will be having heart surgery tomorrow. Even with insurance, their bills so far are totaling ~$85,000, before this surgery. Because of breathing issues, who amongst several other hardships, he was medi-flighted over to a hospital in a neighboring state for his surgery, so my friend, her husband, and their toddler will likely be spending next week's holidays there with Faron while he recovers.


**This is how I'm hoping to combine these two subjects:**

My husband and I are poor. But word-of-mouth is the best way to help people out.

I want to auction the actual Sloth painting and donate 100% of the proceedings to their fundraiser. I'm also willing to send you a 4x4 print of the painting for every $20 donated. 

* I've set up [an EBay account for the painting itself](http://www.ebay.com/itm/200848546092?ssPageName=STRK:MESCX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1557.l2649), and it will be set to a 7-day auction starting 2 pm Central time.

* To receive a print, I've made a Gmail account (farondukedonation@gmail.com) for donors to send their name (so we can double-check with the fundraiser page) and address to so that your print can be sent to you. I'm thinking this way will work, but if there are any better ideas, please let me know.

* The painting is 2'x2' on old fence pickets (we had to choose an 'abnormal' substrate) and weighs a ton. I'm willing to try and ship it to the winner of the auction, but I'm also asking the winner of the auction to consider to donating the sloth to the family because the parents (for some ungodly reason) want it in their house. **If you do want to give them the painting, I will send you a 2'x2' high-quality print of it in place of the painting itself.**


My hands feel shaky as I'm writing this because I'm hesitantly hoping that it might work. 

**Thanks for taking the time to read this.**

Also, I'm aware that I might be getting an onslaught of sloth pictures in PMs, so… just know that I feel very strongly about this cause and am willing to endure it.

While I don't know anything about the center other than what is on their website, and I'm not convinced it's anything but holistic quackery and non-scientific non-sense, this is a family searching for hope.

So I run this [blog](http://filipethedinosaur.tumblr.com) about my toy
dinosaur Filipe
([that's the two of us!](http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwKpl35W))

He's snarky and wonderful, [loves
batman](http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwFarAAM) and I've put a lot of
sentimental value into him. Except he's gone missing. My best friend
[Claire loves Filipe too.] (http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwHmTEM3)

Unfortunately Claire and I had a small mix up while out on the town
and lost him. We each thought the other had him! We realized within 10 minutes what had happened but it seems it was too late. We've put up signs and a [craigslist ad](http://pittsburgh.craigslist.org/laf/2997766196.html) but we don't have a lot of faith he's coming back.

But being adults we are willing to accept he is a mass produced toy
and we can get a replacement. Except here's the problem, we can't find him!

We know he was sold at Target in December 2011 from [this brand](http://www.toysmith.com/) with a tag that says ""Prehistoric Dinosaur!"". He shares an item number with [this
dinosaur](http://www.target.com/p/Toysmith-Soft-Dinosaur/-/A-13671924#?lnk=sc_qi_detailbutton) but is a green T-Rex with purple on his back, not a velociraptor. 

We've called every Target in a 20 mile radius of Pittsburgh with no luck. If they have a T-Rex, stores only carry what appears to be a more recent version made of cheaper plastic with a blue back and a tag that drops the redundant ""Prehistoric"". We bought one, but it's not the same. It doesn't feel as expressive.

We've contacted the distributer and are waiting to hear back but again
it seems like a dead end. So at this point we're not sure what else to
do. We've seen Reddit pull amazing feats and we're hoping someone
somewhere has a Filipe they'd like to donate to the blog, or maybe
someone's Target isn't sold out of them and they'd love to send us one? We'll pay for shipping and the toy! Or against all odds you live in Pittsburgh and have our Filipe and read reddit?


In return we can offer
1) eternal gratitude
2) the continuation of an epic blog
3) a feature on the blog
4) home made cookies of your choice sent express mail (Filipe helped
Claire make [these](http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwDhlN3Y) delicious Oatmeal
Raisin cookies a while back )
5) friendship with two clearly awesome girls (I hear this is a big
deal on reddit?) 

Please help us not be [sad](http://tmblr.co/Z3RxJwLEYxbb) anymore.



Edit: We heard back from the manufacturer. He came in a special order for Target several years ago. Reddit, you are our last hope.

A few months ago, I sent out some free phones to people who are interested in developing for android, and I am going to be doing the same this time, but with XBox 360s.  These **must be used for development and can not be used for games**. (well, I guess they could, but I won't send it to someone who will use it for that as a primary function).

If you want to apply for a free XBox, Visit my crappy startup blog here: http://mobiledevschool.com and fill out the google form.  (Also, read about why I'm doing it and other info on that page)

-Pros599

**EDIT 1**: Hey Guys, I have received a lot of great applications and all, but I want to say that I'm kind of intrigued by the fact that only 8 people have applied for XBoxs. In any case, I do appreciate that the 8 of you have an interest in development! :)  I hope that more people apply, as I love hearing everyone's possible use for this machine.  (For those of you who submitted already, take nothing from my previous statement...)

I really wish I could give everyone a 360, but I honestly can't afford it. The ones I'm giving out in may are from the Microsoft Store. (I won $1000 to the store through their smoke your phone contest). What I think I'll do for those who do not win this month (provided you're okay with it), is keep your data secure in the google document so if I ever have another opportunity for more free hardware, you guys will be the first to know! 

Also, I'd like to make a note to those two of the people who didn't read through the form (or blazed through it)... It's obvious. The other redditors took their time and wrote thoughtful responses, and you didn't even check both of the boxes. I mean, I appreciate the traffic I suppose (even though I'm not gaining money for it nor do I want to), but really. Your applications stand out as they will be the first to be ignored.  A sentence of ""I am super cool"" for the reason as to why you deserve the XBox is just - Childish. I mean, you really could have come up with something better like: An alien is holding a ray gun to my head and it is demanding an XBox so  the machine essentially would save my life.

Years later, he took in a homeless family and started a food program for people on the streets of Denver CO. Now, after a critical injury, loss of income, and the resulting poverty, Mo needs our help.

Death due to poverty is preventable and unacceptable and especially in a place of such wealth and comfort as the U.S. where millions of citizens run, bike, walk, climb to stop death by disease. Most of the fundraising efforts we see day to day are in effort to help someone fight a physical disease. These are noble causes no doubt. What about a 59 year old man who suffered an injury resulting in loss of employment, his modest income, and is now deteriorating from this injury due to poverty? These are the people who slip through the cracks, especially in a place like Denver, where a person can wait up to 1 year for their disability application to be reviewed.


Please help my cousin Mo Oz stay off of the streets and acquire the medical treatment he needs to regain his health and independence. You don’t need to run anywhere or raise $1000s to help Mo.

We got done to nearly nothing left, then we decided to shut one of our lines off our cell phones, and sell the one phone.  We just made a decision while I was gone I would have the one cell phone, and my wife would just use the house for in case our son started coming.  Went went to sell my iPhone today and everything went good...

I then went to Amscot to make an money order to pay our rent due tomorrow...all the money this man had given us was indeed counterfeit.  Now we are about $300 short for rent this month and facing a $200 late fee on top of that.

I believe there are many people on here that would consider this to be one of their favorite books. 

I understand that I could teach alternate books, but my kids are so used to going without that they are really starting to despise the district. In fact, morale is low throughout the district because of severe budget cuts. I'm actually forced to go completely paperless because we don't have the money for ink or paper. It is also completely possible for me to be laid off next year.

Please donate any amount of books that you can. I'm not looking for any money. I'm simply looking for any copies of the book that you can find and send to me (new or used). PM me if you're interested in helping out my high school Juniors.

First, I would like to commend the kindness that you offer here, be it tangible aid or advice. I have read through a few recent posts and that has helped push me from uncertainty to actually posting to get help for myself and my fiancée. I'll try to cut down the irrelevant sob story details, but if you want to know, just ask.

I moved in with my fiancée last June. I had saved up some money over the past year to pay the downpayment for an apartment in LA. She came in from out of state (we met online), hoping to get a job while I do some work fixing computers for a 2-person LLC.

July comes and my boss needs to move out of state. The business has been going down and he wanted to take his venture elsewhere. Fine by me, I think. I'm still able to do some home repairs for cash and a few of my boss's clients like me enough to give a little bit of work. Besides, I still have money in the bank and my fiancée should be getting a job any time now since she's been applying everywhere.

August has come and is going. She still doesn't have a job. My work has been slow lately, and it won't get us rent for September. There's a small sliver of hope for us: Vons, Albertsons and Ralphs employees might be going on strike and the stores will be hiring in case their employees walk out. We've applied to all their stores in the vicinity. But, we acknowledge that even if she gets a job, it'd be mid-September before she gets her first paycheck.

So, here I am. I don't really know how the Verification Tool works or what it's for, but I did that. I know there have been people who gamed the kindness offered here, but, I have been to a few Reddit meet-ups in LA, Pasadena, and Santa Monica and there are Reddit people who could verify that my fiancée and I are good people and we're in trouble. I am still embarrassed as to the amount I need to raise for September's rent (and again, that other Redditors know me) and I don't know whether or not I should post that here[.](/$700)

I thank you in advance for kind words and if you can, some financial aid. If you offer a loan, please give us about 3 months or so (depending on the job scene) to get you back your money.

EDIT: Thank you very much for the loan, [slaterhome](http://www.reddit.com/user/slaterhome). I'm waiting for a couple of others who were to donate some before I update the amount we still need (so I can try to make the amounts anonymous to the public). To anyone else who is interested in helping out, we're still some ways away. :(

EDIT2: Thank you [lobster1138](http://www.reddit.com/user/lobster1138), [jeni_cote](http://www.reddit.com/user/jeni_cote), and an another awesome Redditor who wished to remain anonymous. To update, the amount we still need is down to $465! Thank you so much to everyone who has helped, even in the non-monetary way.

EDIT3: Thank you to another anonymous Redditor! We need to raise just $350 more! It's a great feeling to receive aid from people who are just there to help. We thank you so much!

A few weeks ago, my family was strapped for cash, without food, with four days to go to payday.

I posted a message here looking for help, and a kind redditor (whose name I'm withholding for privacy) stepped up to lend a hand.

This redditor's assistance made it possible for us to eat, and well, until we could afford to go to the grocery store on our own. There is nothing so satisfying as the knowledge that my kids won't go to bed hungry.

I'm repaying that debt now, and I'm happy to do so.

So - there are people here, in need, who are not scammers. And they are genuinely grateful for whatever help you can offer, and their intentions are good, just like yours.

In light of recent scams and animosity, though, remember to be smart when you help others. 

Get as much info as you can from your potential giftee. Reddit history is a good place to start. If they're really in dire straits, they'll probably be willing to submit a photo with face and username, proof of their need in writing, an address, the name of an employer or other reference, a phone number, or their own real name. Seeking charity is no time to be shy.

If you're suspicious or uncertain, ask other redditors - and board mods you trust - for help. 

If you don't feel comfortable sending someone money, then don't. Apologize or report them if you must. You might get flamed. Better to have bitterness spewed at you over the Internet than to feel the sting in your bank account, amirite?

The risk of getting scammed will ALWAYS exist - both here and in the real world. In the end, the decision is yours.

Your decision to help someone in need should be made with confidence. So, for those looking for help as well as those offering it: be clear, be kind, be inquisitive. The world has enough pain and betrayal in it;  we're here to help each other.

I see a lot of people on here are in need of cash or food. I also know that the holidays are coming up, and if you have kids, Christmas time can be a very hard time.

 To make extra money, I take paid surveys from home. They are legit, but the catch is that you will definitely not get rich doing this. Most pay with amazon e-gift cards or they send you a check in the mail. Most surveys take 10-15 minutes to do and pay you $1-3 (sometimes more, sometimes less) for completing them. Some surveys even send you new stuff to try out for free. I have recieved full bottles of shampoo, barbeque sauce, napkins, baby lotion and salad dressing.


 I have already recieved checks in the mail and amazon e-gift cards from the sites and I have already applied the amazon e-gift cards to my amazon account and bought items that have been shipped to my apartment, all for free, so I know it's for real.

I make about a hundred dollars a month doing this (I have a part time job too) and it is all very easy. Boring, but easy. Actually, sometimes you do surveys where they show you a new movie or video game trailer that hasn't been released to the public yet, and you tell them if you liked it or not. Those surveys are actually really fun, and I am grateful to get paid for doing them.

 I have been doing this for about four months now and have made about four hundred dollars. I also use Amazons mechanical turk, and I use other sites that award you for using thier search engine (they make money by showing you ads, and you get a small amount back for using thier search engine). I am on about a dozen or so of these sites.

Again, I am not trying to spam, but here are some links to legit sites where you can make a little extra income. I will be upfront and let you know that I am posting my referral links in hopes of being helped out too, because if you join under my link, I will get a bonus for referring new users. I could really use the help. Christmas time is coming up, and my part time job only pays bills and groceries. I hope that I can help you guys out, and I hope that you can help me out. Thanks :)

My dog Karma was taken to the vet this morning and there is an uneasy bill that needs taken care of. My mother took her there and is telling me she is internally bleeding and now externally and is in need of proper hydration, medication and we are waiting on a phone call to know if my Karma is strong enough to withstand any sort of surgery. They did x-rays and found two lumps/bumps in her uterus. She could be having a miscarriage with infection if the lumps are pups.. We don't know yet. Possible surgeries and future infection medications. She was so weak that she had to be taken on a gurney to the back.

She is 6-7 years old and not fixed. (Spayed) She is a malamute mix and one of a kind personality. She's our family dog and we need help. She was abandoned when she was a puppy and while we didn't know it, we tried finding her owners 6 years ago. No one claimed her and we took her in as our own. She is a very loyal dog, though not very protective shes a gentle soul. 

The bill right now is $3900 and everyone is fighting and hostile because it's so much. We need assistance please help our family. 

Please help us in any small way. 

We are trying to find ways to fundraise and any ideas of how to help are needed. Be it a personal donation or directly donated to the vet clinic or links to assistance places.

I can provide proof to people who message me. :(

I live in Akron, Ohio.

It may seem small-minded, but I tend to read these posts and search for people nearby who are in need. I can reach out to them, even if I have no financial means to assist because if they're within 100 miles I can deliver whatever I have that they need without incurring too much additional expense myself. Also, I think this would stop some of the scrolling that occurs in this subreddit.

[REQUEST] Puppy needs help!

Is pretty compelling, but if it's tagged with a locality it may not be scrolled over by people who like myself are low on means and can't afford (as much as it hurts) to help a puppy. I could be a foster home for a dog in my area, could give it a place to recover and be loved and played with. I'm a dog guy, and have two Sons who also love getting out there and playing with our own dogs so it's doable.. But seeing a dog needs help post without a location doesn't inspire me to read more.

I don't know. I just think that posting a relative location (ATL GA is near enough to me, about 80 miles) would have a positive influence on the number of requests we are able to fulfill. I, and many others, want to help. it may be that a better effort would be made if we knew our efforts would be local. I may not have money, but I can work my butt off and help those nearby by doing so. Sweat is cheap, right?

Thanks to your help, my baby has a chance at a long and happy life.",WyldeKat,35,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1chyxm/update_reddit_we_did_it_big_bear_is_finally_home/,"[Part One](http://en.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1c9rt1/never_thought_id_ask_for_help_but_my_kitty_is/)

[Part Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1ccqar/update_baby_bear_made_it_through_the_night_ok_but/)


Reddit, I am here today with amazing news. Thanks to all your help and generosity, Bear was able to have the life-saving surgery he desperately needed. The foreign body had worked its way down through the stomach and into his small intestine, but became lodged in between his small and large intestine where it became impacted. The veterinarian said that he would not have lived another 48 hours without the operation, and would have died a slow and agonizing death. I can't even think about that possibility, it never seemed like an option to just give up.


The vet was absolutely amazing, I have never seen anyone care so much about an animal they had no relation to. He had tears in his eyes when he suggested the option of euthanasia, but was quick to dismiss it as an absolute last resort. At one point when Bear was on the table being examined, he began to cry and tremble in fear. Without even thinking, the vet wrapped his arms around him from behind and scratched his chest while gently kissing him on the head and telling him he was a good boy... Exactly how I comfort Bear when he is upset. He noticed me smiling at him with tears in my eyes and let go of Bear, with a look of embarrassment. He apologized and told me that was how he would comfort his own pet if they were in the same position. It was like an automatic reaction, he saw an animal in pain and immediately wanted to help them in any way he could. He took care of my baby as if he were his own. All of the staff were, in fact, amazing.


He made it through the surgery ok, but had to be kept overnight due to a fever and pancreatic infection caused by the foreign body. We were finally able to bring him home last night, and he has never been happier. He is still in a lot of pain, is running a temperature and not feeling well, but he is slowly getting back to his old self... Eating like a monster, purring like a tank, sucking on his favorite blanket like the big baby that he is.


[Here](http://imgur.com/wiISEvR) he is immediately after coming home, tired but happy. He pretty much spent the whole night in [that same position](http://imgur.com/bJCMSDd). I cuddled up behind him on the bed, and he fell asleep wrapped in my arms, softly purring into my ear. I never thought that I would have that chance again. 


It's a long road to recovery, but we're on our way. [His belly is red and bruised](http://i.imgur.com/TgIUdm2.jpg), but the swelling is going down and the incision is already starting to heal. He has to be kept in the bedroom for a week or so, and keep the cone around his neck for up to 10 days. He does not like the cone of shame :( I'm trying to spend as much time with him as possible so he can leave it off, we've been curled up in bed watching old cartoons. His favorites are Bugs Bunny &amp; Friends, Scooby Doo, and the old 60's Batman &amp; Spiderman.


For anyone curious, [this](http://imgur.com/xP8GB9F) is the cause of all this damn trouble. It seems to be a piece of orange ribbon, approximately 20-24"" long. We still have no idea where it came from! I've never seen it before in my life. I've taken it upon myself to spend the rest of the week Bearproofing the apartment just in case he has anything else stashed away that might cause trouble. Let this be a lesson to the rest of you pet owners out there: Anything that can be eaten, will be eaten. (AKA Murphy's Paw.)


I wanted to say again just how much this has meant to me. I've always known that you guys were awesome, but could never have imagined you would make this miracle possible. On Saturday afternoon, I was facing the harsh reality of having my baby put to sleep... On Sunday afternoon, he was being prepped for a life-saving operation. It would never have been possible without all of your help. I want to thank Reddit in general, and /r/Assistance in particular, for all of your unbelievable support and generosity. A special thanks goes out to /u/mbacpa, /u/wisnowbird, Leah, Amanda, Jason, Ryan, and the other anonymous redditors who have donated either directly to the vet or online. And an extra special thanks to /u/DutchMeNow, who helped us in our time of need despite having their problems with their own beautiful to worry about.


Between our savings, assistance from the vet, and all of your help, we have managed pay off nearly $1100 of the $2900 bill. It's still a lot of financial stress to handle, but it's much more manageable thanks to your help. The donations received were used as a down payment for a surgeon and an OR on Sunday. A copy of the updated invoice can be seen [here](http://imgur.com/IJy4d2t), for those wanting to make sure their donations are being put to good use!  


If anyone would still like to help, donations can still be made via [GoFundMe](http://www.gofundme.com/2leres), or directly to the Western Veterinary Specialists and Emergency Centre by calling 403.770.1340. (Please mention the patient name Bear.) The care we received from the specialists there was amazing, and we would like to repay them as soon as possible. If any funds are raised above the total cost of surgery, they will be donated to the incredible clinic that made this all possible.


So Reddit, that's it. It's been 72 hours since I came to you for help, fearing that my baby would not live through the weekend... And now he is sleeping peacefully beside me, with a smile on his face and a new lease on life. I cannot believe the miracle you made happen...  And I cannot express the impact your generosity has had on me. Keep being awesome. 


Thanks to your help, my baby has a chance at a long and happy life... And I intend to give him just that.

My brother is being treated like the bad guy in that the majority of his friend's surviving members are calling him a killer, when he did not! His friend was a druggie who abused drugs while dealing with his diabetes. This is a lethal mix to begin with. But anyhow....his friend's sister wants him out of the trailer and has given him until the 15th of March to do so. He's been crying all day and I feel so helpless because I live in PA. His neighbor asked him if he needed anything and all he said was ""a hug"" to which she obliged. He doesn't have a full time job (he works doing side jobs) and now he's out of a roof over his head, as run down as it may be. Is there anybody out there in the Gainsville, Florida area who can help him? He needs work and he needs to rent a cheap apartment. He used to build swimming pools. He's good in construction.

More info inside.",madisonave325,31,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/198nrw/my_big_sweet_dog_needs_work_done_on_his_leg_but/,"[link to Baxter's Fund A Pet Miracle site](http://fundapetmiracle.com/projects/baxters-leg-brace1/430)

To sum the situation up, last year, we noticed that Baxter's back leg didn't seem to be working right for him. It steadily got worse until, right now, it twists sideways when he walks. He falls down a lot and has lost a LOT of muscle definition. When he lays down, it's like he loses feeling of it. It will be sticking out to the side and he'll start to roll over onto it, pushing it out unnaturally, but he doesn't seem to notice at all. We can't take him on more than one or two block long walks (and only on flat surfaces).

I know it says ""Baxter's leg brace"" but our most recent vet appointment showed that he might need anything from a brace for the good leg (to keep him from wearing it out), braces on both legs, surgery on his bag leg *and* a brace on the good leg... Basically any combo. The braces we found range from $400-800 (he's big and it's custom made so i'm guessing his would be in the upper range). The surgery would be close to $3000. (So basically, if he needs the surgery and two braces, we're looking at $4000+)

I'll be straight with you: we don't have that money. We're doing our best and putting money away for Baxter when we can, but we only have a little over a month left before we find out what exactly he needs done and there's no way we can raise the money needed in time. Basically, our best isn't enough right now and we don't want to let Baxter get worse because of that. 

Any help you could give us would be greatly appreciated, whether it's a monetary donation, or just sending a link to Baxter's page to all your animal loving friends. Thank you!!

They have required many surgeries and one has been left a paraplegic.",soupx360a,34,8,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/188a0h/18_year_old_twin_brothers_one_who_wanted_to_be_a/,"http://www.giveforward.com/danforresttheissdonat

Two of my friends from high school, Dan and Forrest Theiss have been diagnosed with a very serious condition. Here is the information taken directly from the donation page in the link above, made by their brother. 

&gt;18 year-old identical twin brothers, Daniel and Forrest Theiss, have been diagnosed with an extremely rare condition that affects all of the blood vessels in their body.  There is no name for this condition, but it is aggressive and causes the blood vessel walls to rip and shred easily.  Within the past 12 months, Daniel has had 3 major operations, including open heart surgery, brain surgery and descending Aorta replacement surgery.  The most recent operation has left him paralyzed from the waist down.  Forrest has had open heart surgery and has been awaiting brain surgery for aneurysms.  Please read their story, as told by their father, Matthew Theiss.

 

&gt;In June of 2011, my 16 year-old twins Forrest and Daniel Theiss helped pack and moved with their stepmom and me from Long Island, New York to Mason, Ohio. Each boy carried dozens of 50 lb. boxes in and out of storage and into the RV we traveled in, along with 8 cats, 1 dog and 6 fish. For the next 5 months, everything was normal except for Daniel’s bout of double pneumonia and DVT in both arms. Once settled in Mason, Daniel ran cross country and Forrest began weight lifting and working out with the Marines in Lebanon as a poolee.

 

&gt;That December, Forrest passed his Marine Corps physical and was accepted into the delayed enlistment program by the Marines.  He had planned to become a military linguist.  In February, Daniel went to enlist in the Army as a medic.  However, to everyone’s surprise, he failed the physical because the doctor heard a slight heart murmur.  For a healthy young man who ran track for several years, it seemed unusual.  That same night, Daniel complained of severe stomach pain, so we took him to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, where he was diagnosed with an Abdominal Aortic Dissection (AAD). A subsequent thoracic echocardiogram revealed he also had an enlarged Aortic root.  At that point, everyone in the family had to be tested, including his mother, older brother, twin brother and his dad. Testing revealed that his twin brother, Forrest, had an enlarged Aortic root, also. Further genetic testing was done, confirming that only the identical twin brothers had a unique genetic mutation in their ACTA2 gene, which is associated with the body’s smooth muscles and now also associated with connective tissue.

 

&gt;In hindsight, some things started to make sense. At age 11, we discovered that the boys have congenital mydriasis (pupils that do not dilate); also, both boys have had stomach issues and were on high fiber diets. It was an “a-ha” moment, but no one expected this. Doctors considered their condition serious but not acute, although they could not assure us that their Aortas would not burst or critically dissect at any time. They definitely needed surgery to replace their Aortas, but the doctors were comfortable with waiting several weeks.  So, my wife and I reluctantly took them home and sent them back to school.  We created an emergency medical plan with the school nurse that stated if the kids feel acute pain in school, they were to be ambulanced to Cincinnati Children’s Hospital immediately.

 

&gt;In February 2012, Daniel felt ill at school and activated the plan. I rushed to the hospital to be with him and he was admitted for evaluation. That same day, Forrest came home from school and my wife could see that something was wrong.  She called me and said he was looking pale and complaining about numbness in his left arm. I told her to bring him in to the ER right away.  However, being a teenager, Forrest had different plans and instead, first drove himself to the Marines recruiting center to hand in the medical prognosis that would lead to his medical discharge from the Marines. The ER was eventually notified that Forrest was on the way.  He sat in the ER for seven hours, receiving an X-ray and little care until about 9pm, when they finally did an MRI and at 10pm, told us that he needed emergency surgery because of an upper Aortic dissection. The surgeon then told us that he would not try to save Forrest’s own valves, which meant that he would need mechanical valves that would click and require him to take blood thinners for his entire life.  Having researched the issue on the internet and after contacting Doctor Svensson at the Cleveland Clinic for a second opinion, I knew that if his valves were good, they could be saved.  Since his vitals were stable, I made the difficult decision to deny care and have him sent to Cleveland for emergency surgery. Due to the weather, he could not be flown and had to take an ambulance. We waited for 2 hours before a crew that could drive him eventually showed up for the 4 hour ride.  Meanwhile, the doctors kept telling me he could die at any moment and would most likely die on route. My son the jokester told me that if he didn’t make it, it would all be my fault. Well, he did make it, and had emergency surgery at 5am.  The next day, Daniel was sent by medical helicopter to the Cleveland Clinic for the same operation, which he had 4 days later.

 

&gt;Both boys had successful Aortic Root replacements with a David’s valve sparing procedure performed by Dr. Eric Roselli. Unexpectedly, after surgery, the boys had several complications. Daniel developed fluid in his lungs and needed multiple taps both in recovery at Cleveland Clinic and after he was released home. Forrest had to have pericardial fluid drained while in the hospital.  He also developed a severe skin rash as an allergic reaction to his antibiotics and then developed DVTs in his legs, requiring the insertion of a filter in his veins.

 

&gt;After months of outpatient rehab, both boys recovered and gained enough strength to eventually be cleared to go to work or school and lift half of their body weight. Daniel decided to stay in Mason and got a job at Sonic, with the eventual goal of studying to be an EMT.  Forrest decided to move back to New York and attend Suffolk Community College with the goal of becoming an RN.  After their diagnosis, they had to accept that military service was no longer an option.  Their heart surgery made both of them realize that they wanted to pursue careers in the medical field, to help others as so many helped them throughout their ordeal.

 

&gt;However, as the months progressed, Daniel began complaining about dizziness and numbness. Being cautious, we took him the ER on multiple occasions, where we were told that he was orthostatic (very low blood pressure, combined with a fast heart rate).  They advised us to increase his fluids and salt intake, and to have him wear compression socks.

 

&gt;In August 2012, when none of these recommendations seemed to work, my wife convinced Daniel’s general practitioner to order a CT scan or MRI of his brain. The MRI revealed that he had ragged, fusiform aneurysms in each of his Internal Carotid arteries. He was taken back to Cleveland Clinic, where the neurologists confirmed the diagnosis but stated that they could not operate for several months, for bureaucratic reasons.  After being discharged from Cleveland Clinic, my wife and I decided not to rush home, but to stay in Cleveland near the hospital for a couple of days, to see how Daniel would do.  It was the right decision, because we had to rush him back to the ER the next afternoon, when his vision went blurry. Since Cleveland Clinic still could not do the endoscopic stent procedure required to occlude the aneurysm, we decided to pull him from the hospital against medical advice and drive him to Stony Brook University, where he could be seen by Dr. Henry Woo, a leading vascular neurosurgeon.

 

&gt;In September 2012, Dr. Woo placed 12 stents in Daniel’s left ICA.  Meanwhile, we had his brother Forrest tested, and found out that he had similar aneurysms in his internal carotid arteries. Since Daniel’s right side and both of Forrest’s sides were too wide to use the same stent, Dr. Woo told us we could apply for a “compassionate use” exception to use a non-FDA approved stent that would fit both him and his brother.  However, while awaiting word on the whether or not the compassionate use was approved, Daniel experienced excruciating pain.  Upon taking him to the ER, we learned that his AAD enlarged and further dissected to the point of requiring surgery.

 

&gt;Daniel’s surgery was on January 22, 2013 at the Cleveland Clinic.  Forrest flew out to Cleveland to support his brother.  While waiting for Daniel to come out of the operation, Forrest developed a blood clot in his brain, causing a stroke and he was rushed to the ER.  He is recovering from that well, but now has debilitating orthostatic hypotension. At the same time, post-surgery, Daniel slowly lost feeling in his legs and was diagnosed with a spinal cord infarction that has made him a paraplegic. He has complete paralysis from his belly button down and has no control of his bodily functions.

 

&gt;As if all of this weren’t enough, the boys’ genetic condition was diagnosed as “aggressive.”  In one year, their blood vessel tissue has degenerated to the point where it is no longer safe for the neurosurgeon to do the stent procedure for their carotid aneurysms. No one knows how long they have until their brain aneurysms rupture and they die. In addition, all the blood vessels in their body are vulnerable to ripping, shredding, and wreaking havoc on major organs. 

 

&gt;Despite everything, the boys remain true to their amazing characters: hopeful and committed to living each day to the fullest and getting the most out of the life they have left!

I'm not sure how much information everyone is looking for so if you have more questions please don't hesitate to ask. I'll be your open book! 

On May 5, 2011 at 9:59pm I gave birth to my first child, Olivia Reegan. I was 27 weeks 0 days when I delivered. No one saw it coming, days earlier I had a doctor's appointment where I was told everything was fine. 2 weeks earlier I went in because I suspected my water broke but I was told it had not...at delivery it was found my water had indeed broken. Test's for preterm labor, I would later found out, aren't very conclusive. 

She was rushed to the NICU where we were allowed to see her for the first time a few hours later. She was too small and fragile to wear a diaper, so they swaddled her in one instead. There were tubes everywhere. She was on ventilation to help her breath and weighed a whopping 712 grams, ~1lb9oz. 

The nurses just stood with us, everything was silent. Since I delivered naturally I could move around pretty freely and just leaned on my fiance. After what felt like hours but was probably close to a minute I nearly fainted. Realizing the gravity of this situation, of the life that hung in a very grey balance. 

There is a lot to this story so I will just flash forward to August. We had spent everyday since her birth in the NICU. Taking one step forward and two steps back. Dad worked and Mom learned every hospital term, option, and setting that it took to raise a fragile child. In August I knew the positive things I was being told though were not the reality of my situation. I had learned ventilation settings so well that no one needed to speak to me anymore, I knew the signs were not good. Her doctor talked to us and told us we needed to think about surgery for a tracheostomy because ventilation was looking longer term. 

I turned to the internet and learned about a life of home ventilation. It seemed daunting but I had to make this all worth it for her. I had to try and get her out of that damn hospital alive. We went ahead with the trach surgery on August 5th. She died on the table but had a determined nurse that I'll never be more grateful for hand picking to go in there with her. She made them work for 10 minutes and Olivia came back. 

It was very touch and go after surgery. Two days spent sleeping next to her crib in a computer rolling chair. But she pulled through. And we finally got a change of scenery. We went upstairs to the PICU to learn how to be responsible for at home ventilation care. But we'd get more than we bargained for. She was scheduled for a last surgery on the 19th for a g-tube since she wouldn't be able to eat. At 7am on August 19th we were called and told surgery was canceled and we should come in. We walked in and her 30% oxygen requirement was at 100% (you and I require ~21.5%). 

Something was very wrong but we got a lot of ""we don't know"" and ""we'll run more tests."" On August 20th our worst fears were confirmed. She had a colonization of MRSA in her lungs and tested positive for KCP (Klebsiella pneumoniae). KCP is considered an instant killer, especially in someone as compromised as Olivia. We were told she would not last the weekend. We camped out in the room and prepared for her to die. Besides one terrifying incident the weekend was actually pretty quiet. We thought we had a chance. And she fought like hell. 

Unfortunately the bacteria was ravaging her body. She was bloated, medically unconscious, and so pale. Eventually we signed a DNR, things could end peacefully that way. On September 19 she had the best day yet. Her sats were great and we all didn't want to rock the boat so we skipped our nightly 12am bath and headed home for a nights rest. 

At 4am we received a call. Olivia's sats had plummeted and they weren't coming back up. We didn't speak until we got on the elevator. Emery, my fiance, promised it would be ok, not matter what happened. When we arrived her room was packed. Only the nurses looked familiar. Her sats were awful. Her blood pressure was barely registering. We walked out of the room to talk about what we needed to do. Neither of us could say it so we walked back in. 

I asked to hold her, which they obliged. With her in my arms I asked everyone else to leave. It was finally just Emery, Olivia, and I. 


The March of Dimes is a charity which hosts the March for Babies every year. The March of Dimes funds research into pre-term birth and infant mortality. They have also provided us a way to help others for Olivia. I don't come asking for much, a dollar goes a long way.

I work in a veterinary emergency hospital in Fresno, California and last week an old man brought in [this dog](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bKhPAeyszP4/UOXKxhHQltI/AAAAAAAAAKg/MUpkDbqA6VM/s1600/no+name.jpg).  He had seen her get hit by a car and thought she was dead, finding that she was alive he brought her into the hospital.

After a few days we couldn't get a hold of the owner and feared that maybe he abandoned her, next day we came to find out that he had actually passed away :(     Left in the balance was [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vrv0-5bxoeo/UOXKqi7_FGI/AAAAAAAAAKY/ECVw2iB6TEw/s1600/IMG_1930.JPG) helpless dog- she was slated to be euthanized.  

In all my years working in veterinary medicine I'm not sure that I've ever cared for a sweeter animal, I could not let this happen.  I convinced the owners son to surrender the pet to me, I am now responsible for getting her all better and finding her a home (and paying for all of it). 

  I'm appealing to you for help reddit. This is an amazing community with a big heart. [I'm raising donations for a surgery](http://nonamefund.blogspot.com/) so that this girl can run again soon.  She has a coxofemoral luxation (basically her femur popped out of the hip socket), my employment affords me a small discount but surgery is still a sizable sum (roughly $1500-$2000).  Please feel free to PM me with any questions and thank you for your support.

1355394711.0,28,self.Assistance,14s2t4,My class has the opportunity to get 7 laptops for $432 through DonorsChoose - if funded within 7 days [UT],michann00,31,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/14s2t4/my_class_has_the_opportunity_to_get_7_laptops_for/,"Google worked together with DonorsChoose to offer a limited amount of the Samsung Chromebooks for $99. I was fortunate enough to get in on the deal. I have 2 programs I really would like my students to work on to individually work on skills they struggle with. This will not take place of teaching time, but will be a part of a daily center so students who struggle will work on exactly what they struggle with and those who are excelling will be able to work on the level they are on. I know the Chromebooks aren't perfect for everyone, but they will honestly transform my classroom.
Why am I trying to get it funded in the first 7 days? Well, each teacher has 7 days to use the match code INSPIRE for donations on their project that doubles any donation. So if you donate $10 and put in the code, you actually donate $20. 
Usually when you donate through DonorsChoose, if you donate over $50, you get a set of letters from the students. Well, to you redditors, if you donate over $10 (so it'll be $20 with the code), message me and I'll have a few of my students write you a thank you note. I make sure it's safe by not including last names. I will tell you my students draw the greatest things on their thank you notes. You could even request pictures (as long as they were appropriate)
Anyway, here's the link to this amazing opportunity and I really hope it doesn't fall through my fingers.
http://www.donorschoose.org/project/samsung-chromebooks-for-a-portable-class/832654/?verify=1597357633

TLDR: Donate to my class using the code INSPIRE, a $10 donation w/a message from you on here and I'll have some students write a thank you with an amazing picture on it. I have 7 days to do this.

NINJA EDIT for grammar.

UPDATE: Wow! We are already down to $283, but with matching that's only $142. If you gave, please make sure to message me your info, they only give me info on those who give over $50, but I want to make sure I write thank you's to those who did $10 or more. I do see lots of pics of kittens in my near future.

Posting once more before my son's birthday (next Monday).  Although, initially, there were many responses, not many cards have come in.  (To those who sent something, it means more then you can imagine. Will be posting pics) 


My son is turning 10 next Monday and, as things have been extremely difficult financially (both my boys are special needs, insurance last year changed to a company that offers no autism or developmental delay coverage, gas is insane and I go through a lot for therapy/specialist appointments, etc) these past twoish years, we just do not have the money for gifts or much of a celebration. He receives almost nothing from family for Xmas/birthdays. We stopped having parties as no child has ever shown up for a birthday party of his (heartbreaking).  He will really enjoy receiving a bunch of birthday wishes from all over and it will make his birthday extra special even if we cannot afford much! 

Jamie is my little trooper. He is autistic and has many syndromes and deficits that sometimes go along with being on the spectrum (motor skills deficits, hypotonia, dysgraphia, executive function deficits, social skills deficits, generalized anxiety disorder, speech &amp; language deficits, Sensory Processing Disorder, etc, etc). He was just diagnosed with Tourette's this year (and it has been a pita trying to get his painful tics under control. His meds seem to have stopped working again these past two weeks...) and we just found out he may have Ankylosing Splondylitis (I was just diagnosed a few months ago. Extremely painful auto-immune disease).  He is extremely high functioning and it took years and years of an unbelievable amount of therapy and tutoring, which he has rarely ever complained about!

He's dealt with a lot of consistent bullying since kindergarten. We finally had the board of ed agree to a school transfer, so last year (and so far this year) there have been no incidents of bullying, yet none of his peers want anything to do with him or will play with him at recess (something the school considers not a big deal).  He has done (and continues to do) a ton of therapy/tutoring and seems to always be going to some specialist appointment and he very rarely complains. He doesn't complain being dragged to his baby brother's therapies and appointments either (we spend at least 4 hours just driving to therapies weekly, sometimes up to 10 hours weekly depending on if either (or both) boys have a specialist visit).  It looks like our youngest may end up with the same or similar diagnoses. 

He's just an awesome kid. He loves TF2, Skyrim and Minecraft.  TF2 is his obsession ATM (Pyro is his go to).  He's seen almost every episode of Dr Who (7/10 doctors) and every episode of Mythbusters, Soul Eater, Wolf's Rain and MLP (yes, he's a Bronie and is so embarrassed that he won't admit it to anyone).  He makes rage comics (he knows what Reddit is but doesn't browse it) and builds awesome Halo Mega Bloks toymations.  He loves to watch terrible scary B movies with me.  He also loves Skrillex and could gem mine for hours on end.  He says he will have no problem becoming a CEO of a multi-billion dollar company (apparently, dentists don't make enough).  He's a great big brother, even when the baby is annoying him (he says his brother is the best thing that has happened in his life).  He's the type of person who would take the gift bags we made for his birthday party to the kids at school/therapy/social skills play group/therapeutic horseback riding group even though not a single one of them showed up to his birthday party...

He has come so far. Back when he was diagnosed, he couldn't skip, hop, run without falling, write his name legibly (writing is still painful and tiring so he uses the school's laptop much of the time), zip, snap, button, etc. Now he's reading at a 6th grade level (he's in 4th), volunteers with the kindergarten class to help them learn to read, is trying hard to be able to tie his shoes (motor skills/executive function deficits make it extremely hard for him) and as soon as we can afford to get him a bike, he has decided he is going to work on learning to ride in physical therapy (a huge goal for him)!  

Seriously, i could go on and on about how great my Jamie is!  To say the least, I am an extremely proud mom!

Tl;dr: I have a little boy turning 10, who is kinda lonely, has worked extremely hard in life and has had a rough couple of years. He would love to receive a bunch of cards/postcards for his birthday...it will brighten his day!  He's pretty damn awesome too. (Yeah, I kind of adore him)

Day after day, I am amazed by the high quality caliber of people that are in this community and that is why I am asking for help right now.

A little about myself, I am a 35 year old male from Nashville, Tennessee and I am currently working on my bachelor's degree in applied computer science. My focus is on computer programming and I am really enjoying it thus far. I received my associate's last September and I graduated valedictorian of my class with a 4.0 GPA. My fiancee is 26 years old and is also in college. She will be graduating with her associate's later this year. We both go to school full time and we both work full time. We have two cats and one dog who we love very much. We're pretty quiet people and would rather stay at home and enjoy each other's company than go out to a bar or a dance club.

I have been dating my fiancee for six years now and, last Christmas, I asked her to marry me. Neither of our families are families of means, so we are having to foot the bill for our own wedding. We have tried to keep it small, yet include as many of our friends and family as we possibly can. We started with a list of around ninety people, but we managed to whittle it down to about 55. We planned out a budget and a way to save some money and then it's like everything turned against us.

First up was the alternator going out on our car. We drive a Volkswagen Jetta and, if you've ever driven a Volkswagen that isn't a Beetle, you will know that the parts for these cars are ridiculously expensive. Between the cost of parts and paying the mechanic to do the actual work, we were set back over $600.

We both work full time at Wal-Mart, so it isn't like we've got tons of cash rolling in every month. Most times, it's just barely enough to pay the bills, but we figured we could tighten our belts and sacrifice comforts here and there so that we could have a good wedding day in October.

Well, yesterday, we noticed that our cat was sneezing a lot and drooling everywhere and we got concerned, so we had to take him to the vet today. Between the x-rays to make sure he doesn't have pneumonia, the cost of the visit itself, and the medication, that set us back another unexpected $200.

Well, it doesn't end there. A few years ago, my fiancee was involved in an automobile accident just days after her insurance had lapsed. She had to go to court to get it all sorted out. The other driver's insurance company was demanding she pay them some insane amount of money or else they'd request that the state suspend her driving privileges. Well, she made a deal to stick to a payment plan where she'd pay them back a little each month to avoid having her license suspended/revoked and she has been sticking to it moth after month. Earlier this year, she and I got rid of the car that had been in the wreck and traded it in for a better one. The car company said that we both had to have insurance, so I added her to my policy. Today I got a letter in the mail informing me that my policy was being cancelled because, apparently, they went ahead and revoked her license anyway. She called the department of transportation and, between the court costs, document fees, and reinstatement fees, that's going to cost another $500.

Needless to say, this has all gotten us feeling pretty helpless and depressed. We are praying that some kind of miracle happens. I am trying to find a better job so that I can put my degree to use, but there's no telling how quickly that will happen. We are praying for some kind of miracle and I am hoping beyond hope that someone that reads this can help us in some way.

So far, she has purchased her wedding dress, we have put a down payment on the location, and we have reserved a pastor for the occasion. We have yet to buy our rings and there is no telling how we're going to rent me a tuxedo or feed the few guests we can afford to invite. 

From she and I to all of you, thank you in advance for anything that you can assist us with.",,False,,t5_2s25d,False,,,True,t3_v30sx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/v30sx/my_upcoming_wedding_is_turning_into_a_disaster/,

P.S.: he lives in Argentina

&gt; From Brian Grove 
&gt; 
&gt; Brian at rescueddoggies dot com
&gt; 
&gt; My apologies for this not being an update but I should let you know what's happening.
&gt; 
&gt;  As most of you know, although I am British, I run a small animal refuge in Argentina in a rented house with about 1000m2 of land. Seven months ago I was warned that the owner had to sell the house and land the refuge is on by 2013 or 2014.
&gt; 
&gt;  A few weeks ago, he informed me that a buyer had unexpectedly turned up already and the sale has gone through. This means that the rental contract will not be renewed and we have to leave by the 8th June THIS YEAR (2012)
&gt; 
&gt;  Finding a place to rent with almost fifty dogs (and two cats) is virtually impossible To do so with very little money (I depend on donations) is even harder.
&gt; 
&gt;  Someone offered me some land, but there is still the mammoth task of building a refuge, plus somewhere for me to live on land which doesn't even have a water supply or electricity at the moment (and forget a phone line or Internet!).
&gt; 
&gt;  Now even that looks like falling through due to possible legal problems with the ownership status of the land.
&gt; 
&gt;  So, in roughly fifty days, I and the animals will be homeless as no other refuge is in a position to take them.
&gt; 
&gt;  After my beloved wife Sheila died, I wanted to follow her. Only the fact that I couldn't abandon the animals who were our family (she couldn't have kids), stopped me. Now, it seems that I will be forced to abandon them anyway, so there will be no reason to continue in a world I've come to hate.
&gt; 
&gt;  Any inspiration for stories has left me. I can barely force myself through the daily routine of feeding the dogs, I spend most of my day (and over half the night) sitting at my computer, reading various stories, if I can concentrate that long, and waiting for the time to run out.
&gt; 
&gt;  Anyone got any Nightlock?(For those who are Harry Potter fans but no Hunger Games fans, Nightlock are lethal berries in the first Hunger Games book, and the name is used for lethal poison capsules – suicide pills – in the third Hunger Games book.)
&gt; 
&gt; I'd like to thank all those who have followed my stories through the years, especially those of you who have taken the time to review.

My dog Riddle is in trouble. Not quite a week ago, she ruptured her ACL... This means the ligaments in her leg have completly ripped apart and she cannot walk or put pressure on the leg. She ruptured the ACL in her right knee a few years back, and we were able to scrape together the money for that surgery, but... each surgery is roughly $3,800. Her right knee was only a partial tear, so we were able to save up over a while without her being in too much pain, but this one is a full tear. She's currently wearing a harness most of the time so we can help her get up and down, go down the stairs, and get around easier. We are saving up to get the surgery, but it is going to take a long time and it makes me sick to see her hobble around and spend her days sleeping. 

Of course, you can't talk about animals on Reddit without cute pictures! 

Here is a Imgur gallery: http://imgur.com/a/S3BcB#0

Here is a video of Riddle in action before she was injured: http://youtu.be/WpLZFyqR9qE

I know that this isn't a cause equal in size and global importance to some Reddit has championed in the past, but something that matters dearly to us. Our dogs are our children. We do everything we can to ensure they get the best care possible, from making their food, to exercising and training regularly, to spending a fortune on vet bills as it seems we're destined to do with poor Riddle. 

I don't like asking for donations, and as I said we are saving up to get the surgery, but every day or month it takes us to save is time that our baby is in pain, and that's tearing us apart. Any donation you could help us out with would be amazing, even just an upvote to gain more visibility.

If we raise five dollars I will consider this a success, anything helps.

I am not expecting that this will be huge, but if it does blow up any money that exceeds the cost of Riddle's surgery will be donated to a local dog rescue and foster team, All For Dogs.

We have a Paypal account to accept donations, or if your not comfortable paying into a random Paypal account donations can be made to Bend Veterinary Specialists, which is the place where Riddle will be having her surgery.

Thank you, for even taking the time to look at this thank you. Any bit of good will sent our way is amazing.

I didn't want to do this but I didn't know where else to turn. It's going to be a long post with several verifiables in it because I feel like I'm asking for a lot.

To start, last November - 2010, not 2011 - my wife lost her job. She has looked for work since then but found nothing. We were doing okay until the house of cards that was our finances took a steep tumble late last year.

First, let me tell you a bit about who I am for verification. Edrondol. Real name David Nihsen. I'm in the book so phone should be easy to get. Please don't call, though. It would freak my wife the fuck out.

Anyway, late last year several bills and repairs came due simultaneously and we got behind on bills, specifically the mortgage that we could no longer afford. One thing led to another and they sold it. We had to move. [Here's the county assessor site for the property.](http://douglasne.mapping-online.com/DouglasCoNe/static/accountinfo.jsp?accountno=R2531220774) Hope you can go right to that. The address is 4203 S 61 Ave in Omaha. It's the bank's now. I hope that I'm not breaking any rules giving out the address.

Two weeks ago my father passed away. [Here's his obit.](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/omaha/obituary.aspx?n=paul-william-nihsen&amp;pid=155780759) The problem is, neither my mother nor I were on the loan for the Chevy HHR which I and my family drove. I tried to get on the loan before and they wouldn't let me because of my credit. So when my father died the bank came and took it. Technically they did still own it, even though I'd been making payments on it for a few years now.

So now I'm left with one car that has broken down continually, no money in savings as we had to blow everything moving and paying off what we could. There's no way my wife could get a job without being able to drive and last time we tried to get anything on our credit they laughed at us. Hell, we were about 12 hours from homelessness before we stumbled onto this place. Add that we have to get my daughter to school and my son to work and you have a good old-fashioned shit storm of hurt.

So I'm asking for help. I just need a car. Doesn't have to be anything fancy. Just needs to run and get hopefully good gas mileage. 

Oh, and if mods want verification for this, they can feel free to message me and I'll let them call me at home. Thanks for listening. Have a great night.",,False,,t5_2s25d,False,,,True,t3_pt7k6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/pt7k6/i_could_really_use_your_help_right_now_they_just/,

I have family and friends here, and I've been a redditor for almost 5 years, and am quite ashamed to be here. I didn't see it happening, but I've run into quite a few problems with life, and as a result, I'm financially backwards. I don't see an immediate end to my problems, but I'm looking to keep my head up.

Without going into a sob story, I have a wife and a small little boy who means the world to me. I'm not being the best father in the world right now, and I need to get our heat turned on. The bill isn't dreadfully large, however I've run into a wall with getting the situation fixed. Because I've used my credit card to pay the bill in the past, since they tried billing it again and no funds were available, they're not accepting anything but cash-payments from me at this point. To boot, we were on a payment plan, and I've missed the last payment by 10 days. I'm rather shocked actually with how this has worked out.

I've contacted our local welfare office, and a few charities that are supposed to help with heat,  however, we just don't qualify. I'm stunned, because I've been a  hard-working taxpayer my entire life, have kicked into the system every which way possible, and I always give my change to the bell-ringer's for the Salvation Army.

I'm not sure who I pissed off, but if that person / entity is reading this: I'm sorry. Really.

Any points in the right direction would help. I've finished applying for small jobs at odesk, rentacoder, and vworker, and haven't had any bites yet - but there's hope! :)

Thanks for listening reddit!

**UPDATE**
Thanks to those for the comments and suggestions, I've done my best to follow-up with the recommendations given. At this point, it's 3:30pm, it's Friday afternoon, and I'm already past freaked-out. At this point, I don't even know if I can get the heating company out here anymore. If anyone has any further ideas, I'm definitely game. Finally, I'm willing to do A TON of work to make this happen. Literally. Anything.

**UPDATE 2**
A very kind redditor has just sent, without even requesting any work, or even asking to be paid back some funds our way. I'm like really floored by this. Thank you, PhoenixMan83. We're now down to $135 or so left. I guess, by his suggestion as well, it doesn't hurt to put the paypal out here at this point either, but I feel rather ""grungy"" about this. [Redacted] is my paypal address. Thank you again. :)

That said, I'd really rather work for the remaining funds if possible. It's now 4:15pm... I'll admit that the situation is looking fairly grim, but a neighbor suggested that I may be able to get the heating company to come out if I have cash in-hand for when they get here. That's rural business for you, I guess. So if I anyone has ANYTHING I can do, I'm definitely game for it.

**UPDATE 3** HOLY-HECK REDDIT! I feel like using profanity to exclaim my surprise, but feel it's inappropriate at this point. You guys like... GAVE me the cash. :( WTF REDDIT, I'M CRYING. I FRIGGIN LOVE YOU AND HATE YOU AT THE SAME TIME. 

THANK YOU TO PhoenixMan83, girrrrrrrrrrl, and flamingcow. You guys have made a father not look so freakin-bad in front of his family today, and saved us as well. I will do my best to repay. THANK YOU SO MUCH!

**UPDATE 4**

Some folks have asked if I'd still be willing to do work, and the answer to that is a resounding ""Yes!!!""  I don't think I have to explain much further that my financial situation is not where I would like it to be and well, ... Christmas IS coming. If anyone has ANY work at all, please do let me know.

I thought I would post an update here because there are so many of you who asked me to keep you updated on my son, Jerrick who is almost 12 weeks old and who will be having surgery to correct saggital craniosynostosis. For those of you who don't know the story, I have not been a redittor very long, but have been helping wherever I can (including this week). I have a son who was recently diagnosed with severe saggital craniosynostosis and his head is quickly deforming because of it. He has been seen by several specialist including by Dartmouth Hitchcock and Children's Hospital in Boston, and it has been decided that he needs reconstructive cranial surgery to keep his head and face from deforming and keep the pressure off his brain and causing mental handicap...

The update is that the surgery is going to take place a week from tomorrow at Dartmouth Hitchcock in Lebanon, New Hampshire. They will be opening his head and severing the  saggital suture that has prematurely fused and cutting out bone to reconstruct the parts of his skull that have mishapen, so that his brain can grow normally and his head will return to a normal shape. 

That being said, I will be taking 6 weeks out of work while he recovers and bone begins to regrow. We barely get by with me working, just enough to be able to occasionally help on here... with the occasional assist to me here and there... 

We are not desperate yet, but I forsee some financial distress coming without me working for six weeks, so if any of you amazing people whom I have had the pleasure of communication with are willing to help... I can accept monetary donations through my paypal which is alexa.leonard84@yahoo.com... or there are a few smaller things I anticipate we'll run out of.... I can make a list of those things? Maybe non perishable foods will help us maintain the budget until I can go back to work?

Anything anyone can do just to help us make it through the next 6 weeks is more than helpful....

Before you downvote my plea for a little help... please look at my reddit history, I have not been here long but I have posted many offers, sent assistance to many through their posts for help and given as much good advice as I could... you can see clearly that I have and I will continue to pay it forward, but i need your help now to make it through the next 6 weeks...

I am from the Central Florida area, and I want nothing more than to make the transition to D.C. to pursue this incredible opportunity that I've been given. However, I am also a student with a disability. I am confined to a wheelchair due to a disability called Spinal Muscular Atrophy. I make any and all efforts to be as independent as possible, but there are some activities of daily living that I simply cannot do on my own such as bathing, dressing, etc. Because of these limitations, I have received personal care attendant services in Florida to assist me. I am in need of these services 20+ hours each day, however the cost of these services is enormous (roughly $20/hr). Until I received my Bachelor's degree at the University of Central Florida, Vocational Rehabilitation covered the costs of these expensive services to see that I was able to complete this degree. Because my desire to pursue a higher education degree is not necessary in order for me to find a job, Vocational Rehabilitation has decided to not assist me in paying for my personal care attendants while I attend graduate school at Gallaudet University. I am not one to give up on my dreams, I never have been. I was taught that if I keep looking for options, I will get where I want to be in my life. I want to be successful. I want to look back on my life and think that I've done amazing things. I want everybody to be proud of the life I make for myself. I want to inspire and open people's eyes to possibilities they never saw possible, simply by pushing my own limits. So, I accept that there were drawbacks to my plans for funding these dreams, but there's a motivation and a forward momentum that will get me where I belong. And where I belong is at Gallaudet University. 

That being said, my reason for writing this letter is to find an answer. I am wondering if anybody is aware of a way that I am able to fund my personal care attendants during the pursuit of my AudD degree. If anybody has information  that could assist in funding the over $120,000 per year I have to pay out of pocket for personal care attendants, or philanthropists that are willing to help out an individual student, I am curious. It would be devastating to me to have to pass up the opportunity to attend Gallaudet, simply because I am not as physically capable as other students. 

Thank you sincerely for reading this letter, and hopefully it falls into the right hands. I am going to continue chasing after every lead I come across. I appreciate any advice in advance, and I am so much looking forward to August when I (hopefully) call Gallaudet University my new home and begin my journey toward my graduate degree in Audiology.

We finally got Bear home, and he seemed incredibly happy. He was curled up on the bed, sleeping upside-down, sucking on his favorite blanket, and purring like the big monster he is. He slept through the night ok, but things changed this morning. He started throwing up again, this time much more violently. He couldn't even keep his stomach medicine down, and began vomiting a bloody foam. We immediately rushed him to the emergency vet as quickly as we could in the middle of a raging blizzard. 

After a very painful examination, some x-rays, and IV fluids, the vet has determined that the foreign body is obstructing his small intestine. Bear needs surgery within the next 24 hours. He is currently in stable condition, but is obviously in distress and deteriorating. We were given two options, perform the operation or euthanize him before he suffers too much. 

The thing is, I can't give up on him. I love him more than anything in this world, and can't condemn him to death when he still has a chance at life.


We have managed to work out a deal with the vet, where they will do the surgery up front and we will repay them as soon as we can. The veterinarian we saw was unbelievably caring.... He had tears in his eyes when we discussed the option of euthanasia.  He believes that this is the best option for our Big Bear, and I have to agree. As long as there is still hope, I will not give up on him.

So Reddit, that's about it. Thanks to one of you, my big baby has a chance at life. The generosity of this individual, who would rather remain nameless, has been overwhelming. I want to thank you all for your kind words and advice as well, it definitely helped me get through the day.

I know some of you were wanting proof, so I have included a copy of the surgical estimate [here](http://i.imgur.com/mORo7c8.jpg). Also, I know that a couple of you were wanting to contribute, but unsure how to help. I have spoken with the vet's office and they confirmed that they are able to accept donations over the phone, all you have to do is mention the patient name ""Bear"". Their phone number is 403.770.1340. Feel free to ask them any questions you may have, or just tell them how freaking awesome they are.

I'm off to the vet to say goodbye to Bear and see him into surgery. I'll be gone for a bit but I promise I will update you guys once I get the call saying how things went. With some amazing care and a little bit of luck my baby will be home tomorrow night. Thanks again reddit, keep your fingers crossed for me.

UPDATE: At the suggestion of /u/wisnowbird, I have set up a GoFundMe page [here](http://www.gofundme.com/2leres) where you can donate. Donations can still be made to the veterinary office as well, whichever you would prefer. Thank you so much for all of your support reddit, I'm so overwhelmed I don't even know what to say.

Please help my beloved dog Oscar, who's suffering from unexplained liver failure, and is in critical condition.",GoshDarnMyMittens,31,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/19r13o/hello_reddit_please_help_my_beloved_dog_oscar/,"Hello redditors, my name is Jonathan. I stay in Singapore. I have a 1 1/2 year old local mutt called [Oscar](http://imgur.com/aPCXa2j). In those 36 short months, Oscar has experienced much more ups and downs than any person or dog. I must first apologies for the long post, but I really do want to be as transparent as I can.

By some coincidence, Oscar was [given to a volunteer from Hope Dog Rescue by a cemetery caretaker](http://hopedogrescue.blogspot.sg/2012/06/cemetery-dogs.html). Oscar was suffering from a really bad case of [demodectic mange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demodicosis), his two siblings had already succumbed to the disease, and his mother was nowhere to be found. 

[Over time](http://hopedogrescue.blogspot.sg/2012/06/cemetery-dogs-oscars-updates.html), [he got better](http://hopedogrescue.blogspot.sg/2012/07/oscars-updates.html), and that's where Oscar came into my life. 

My girlfriend Charlene and I researched a long, long time before coming to the conclusion that adopting a rescue dog was much better than buying a dog from a pet store. [There are no checks and balances to control or encourage ethical breeding, and that was one of the reasons we decided to adopt a rescue dog](http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/puppy-mills-pet-store-337803). Charlene liked the name Oscar, and we actually decided naming our puppy Oscar before changing our minds about buying a dog.

And it just happened that we saw from Hope Dog Rescue that Oscar needed a foster home. We decided to visit their adoption drive, and once there, we knew he was the one for us.   

Being a mongrel living in a cemetery, Oscar did not know what to do when we fostered him. He was crazy scared of water and black trash bags. He would run from the sound of running water. He would flinch and bolt at the sight of black trash bags on the street. Who knows what happened during his time in the cemetery?

He is scared of strangers touching him, even until now. As recently as 2 months ago, Oscar would be scared of me picking him up. But eventually he warmed up to us, and our family. 

[This is a short video of Oscar in happier days!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh5Av6K_ZqI) The main cameraman(woman?) is Charlene, and the dude in the video is me. 

We brought Oscar to the vet last Sunday 24th of March, as he had some skin issues (red skin, itchiness). After he was on the medication for one week, we realised something was terribly wrong. The medication causes increased thirst and urination. I had to bring him to pee four times a day (Oscar is outdoor trained). But on Saturday 2nd of March, after his morning walk, we noticed that Oscar did not drink any water from his bowl. [He also refused to eat his meal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG_A0to4Yzc). His poo/diarrhea  was really yellow, soft, and mucuous-y, and he did not pee even a third of what he usually had. His pee was also extremely yellow. We called the vet out of concern, and were advised to bring him in on Sunday. 

He was limp and we had to lift him up. Once he stood, he tried again to poo/pee, with the same problems on Saturday. It was a struggle to get him in the car. We brought him in, and once the vet saw Oscar's condition, she immediately brought him in and ran some checks. 

She told us to leave him at the clinic overnight, on an IV drip, to let his condition stabilise. 

But on Monday, Charlene called me crying. She said that Oscar's white blood cell count were very high, and his liver levels were extremely off the charts (1600 instead of 100 normal range, and 2300 instead of 200 normal range). Oscar began to show signs of Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC).

The vet advised for a plasma transplant to stop this. After a quick discussion with the volunteers, we agreed. After the plasma transfusion was over, we moved him to an animal hospital which could provide 24-hr care for Oscar. 

On the morning of 5th March 2013, I was there discussing with the vet again. She said that they needed an ultrasound scan (which their hospital did not have), so we arranged for an ultrasound at another facility. I called a taxi driver who is a very kind and patient man, and he brought Oscar and me on the facility. After that, another volunteer drove me back to the hospital. The vet also said that Oscar's platelet count had plummeted, from 100k to only 11k overnight. She said a blood transfusion was necessary to give Oscar the platelets needed to fight whatever was going on in his body. We gave our consent, and the volunteers at Hope really shined and got a blood donor in a matter of hours.

His blood donor was a fellow rescue dog named Rudolph, and you can find his [story here](http://hopedogrescue.blogspot.sg/2013/02/stairway-of-neglect_6.html). Rudolph and his owners are heroes, and I really respect and thank them for helping Oscar out of kindness.

I am going to be honest here: I have graduated last year, and I am still currently sourcing for a job. My girlfriend is working. We do not have enough savings for him to go through this. We wanted to adopt a rescue dog for some companionship and love, and Oscar ended up being our best friend who really loved us. We did not expect Oscar to suddenly collapse from liver failure. We have spent at least $3000 on his intensive care (including a plasma and blood transfusion one day after another, on the vets' advice).

I have been living within my means, before this happened. We try to bring Oscar to different places during the weekends, we jog with him, we love him. We were just a couple who adopted a cheerful dog, and we are totally unprepared financially and mentally for this sudden collapse. 

The volunteers at Hope Dog Rescue have been an excellent support network, providing me with transport to the ultrasound facility and back to the hospital. Providing Charlene and I with emotional and mental strength. Finding potential donors for Oscar. They are also in charge of other rescue dogs, some with permanent debilitating sicknesses that also incur financial costs, and Oscar collapsing so suddenly is sad, heart-wrenching and an occurrence that NONE of us, not me, not Charlene, not the rescuers at Hope, not even Oscar himself expected. I am lost and unprepared for this. 

Reddit, I need your help.

I am typing here really quickly on a laptop before I travel down to the place where Oscar is being hospitalized. Rudolph, the blood donor and fellow rescue dog is also there as the transfusion started only at 11pm last night.

I am appealing from the bottom of my heart. I've been here on reddit, and I found the community here to be really capable of great things.

If you stay in Singapore, great! [Please follow the directions here to donate](http://hopedogrescue.blogspot.sg/2013/03/help-save-oscars-life_6.html). Any amount is greatly appreciated. 

If you are staying overseas, I currently have a Paypal account, but I do not know how to convert this into a donation account. I have made a widget, but I do not have a website to put it on. Any help or advice is appreciated. Again, any amount is greatly appreciated. 

I will provide proof, and add more details and updates on Oscar when I have some free time. 

Thank you.

EDIT 1:20PM GST Oscar's platelet has gone even lower. From 11k the night before, to 6k. Rudolph is A-OK, and is his happy self. He has gone back to his family. 

The plan is for Oscar to get back on solid food, but he has no appetite. If he goes on one nostril with an oxygen tube and a feeding tube in the other, that's gonna be stressful for him. Apart from that they are going to let him rest and try to wean him off oxygen.

Murrieta, California/Boise, Idaho",kelahfish,34,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/18obwt/we_are_homeless_and_dont_have_any_resources/,"Hi Assistance. I've been lurking Reddit for a couple of years but never made an account. I know I can't ask for money and I don't know if anyone can help but we have absolutely nothing and no ideas.

I am 20. I had a child at age 18 and married the father. We live with his parents and depend on them 100% financially. I have no formal education. He was a month into online college. I don't have a driver's license or even an ID at this point. We are both mentally ill and need medication to function. Until today we've been depending on his parents, staying at home and raising our child.

Last Monday, my husband came out to me as being transgender (I'm using male pronouns for the sake of clarity). We told his parents, expecting anger and disappointment, but not this. We have, at maximum, two weeks to get out of the house. We are not allowed to keep any personal belongings we didn't pay for. We are not allowed to keep our car. We have about six hundred dollars to our name. The majority of that will have to go to plane tickets. We are able to stay with a friend in Boise until we can hopefully find jobs, but I don't know if that will even happen. Neither of us have ever had a job. The only friend either of us has is the friend in Boise, and she can't hep financially. We don't have any other family whatsoever. We will only have access to public transport. We don't know HOW to interact with people. We won't have access to the medications we need (we both have bipolar disorder, I have Tourette's, he has ADD). We won't have health insurance at all. Currently it looks like we won't have food. As far as personal belongings, we don't have much more than clothes. We do own some valuable things that we paid for, but we don't have time to sell anything. The odds are overwhelmingly against us.

We are signing over custody of our daughter to my husband's parents.  This is the absolute worst thing I've ever had to do, but they would win the custody battle regardless. I don't want to put her through the hell we are experiencing. She is only two, and she likely won't remember us at all. The impact of giving up my child hasn't fully hit me yet.

I feel like the only option right now is to kill myself. I'm too much of a coward, but I don't see the point in trying to live. There's virtually no chance of us ever being successful in life. We are giving up everything we've ever had. I will probably never see my daughter again. I can't even fight for her because I just want her to be safe. I feel like nothing in my life will ever make any of this worth going through.

I honestly don't know what I'm asking for. We're just...completely fucking lost. I've gone through some of the resources in the sidebar but I can't wrap my head around anything yet. We only found out a couple of hours ago. I don't know of anywhere else to ask for help, and I don't know what help to ask for. Please, if anyone has any advice or can help in any way or has any words of encouragement or anything, I don't know, we need it.",,False,,t5_2s25d,False,,,True,t3_18obwt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/18obwt/we_are_homeless_and_dont_have_any_resources/,

I had muscle damage, bruising of the spine and a minor spinal cord injury. I went through the motions of treatment and rehab between the Army and Navy doctors, but when I exhausted all their treatment options, I was discharged into the care of the Department of Veterans Affairs. This was in January of 2007.

It is six years later and my condition isn't much improved if it is at all. I was given a 100% service-connected disability rating, so I don't have to work, which is really a good thing since I can't really do so. I gained almost a hundred pounds in the first couple of years after I was discharged. Through diet I've managed to keep my weight stable, but I know I'm not going to lose the weight unless I can find a way to be more active. And this is where I'm seeking help.

The VA has a ton of stuff a person can do for a cervical spine injury or for a lumbar spine injury, but very little for a thoracic spine injury.

I can't walk more than a couple of blocks, and I can only run for about half a block. (I tried about a month ago. It was a mistake and laid me up for the rest of the day and most of the next.)

",BeADonor,32,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/158mwz/matt_persevered_to_live_as_full_a_life_as_he/,"We Lost Matt on Sunday from complications of a heart condition at the very young age of 27. Matt was an exceptional son, brother, friend, and cousin who struggled with a heart condition throughout his short life. However, to say he struggled wouldn't be entirely accurate. The photo collection at the visitation showed him scuba diving, boating, flying a plane, fishing etc. - things that in my blessedly able state, I haven't taken full opportunity to do yet; it was if Matt knew his time here would be brief, and refused to be limited by his condition. As his uncle eulogized yesterday, Matt got up every day and went to work with a cardiac function of 11%. He noted that, as a physician, he wouldn't expect a patient to get out of bed at that level. It never even occurred to me that Matt was in pain or even uncomfortable because he never complained about it, or the unfair card he was dealt in life. 

Tragically, this is the second child his family has lost, as Matt's brother passed away from the same condition as a toddler. Even in this time of immeasurable grief, his family (the most generous, loving family I've ever been lucky enough to share time with) has sought this as an opportunity to help others like Matt.

So I come to r/assistance asking not for money. The assistance I'm looking for is simply in spreading the word about organ donation. Far too many loved ones are lost because of a tragic shortage of awareness in North America. In Matt's native Ontario, Canada, it takes about 30 seconds to register. Other jurisdictions are similar, and you can find the links below. As another friend said before he passed away, and subsequently donated many of his organs, ""it's simple, if you don't need it, you give it."" 

So register as an organ donor, tell your friends, and spread the word! Take comfort in knowing that, should something unfortunate happen to you, that you may be able to provide up to eight(!) people with countless additional years with their loved ones. It's the greatest gift you can give, and you won't even have to pick up the tab!


Ontario: http://beadonor.ca


BC: http://www.transplant.bc.ca/odr_questionnaire_register.htm


Yukon: http://www.hss.gov.yk.ca/programs/insured_hearing/organdonation/


Unfortunately, no other jurisdictions in Canada have online registration. Each province has different regulations and you may have to contact either your Ministry of Health or Transportation to register. 


All 50 United States and Puerto Rico:

UK: https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/how_to_become_a_donor/registration/registration_form.asp


Australia: http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/services/medicare/australian-organ-donor-register

tl;dr: Save some lives!


Finally, I stress the importance of organ donation above all else, HOWEVER, if you are so inclined to make a financial contribution, we are throwing a fundraiser tonight in Matt's memory, benefiting the Test Your Limits Foundation, a fantastic organization at the Peter Munk Cardiac Center of the Toronto General Hospital. If you're feeling generous, you can donate at https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/6PKd6

So please register, then tell your friends to register, and then go out and live your life with the same kind of carpe diem-like vigour that Matt did.

Original Post Linked And Details Inside...,sysadminwatdo,34,10,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/14ya82/we_thought_we_had_it_figured_out_thought/,"So the original post is here http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/comments/13wx7w/req_600_to_reclaim_car_payback_in_100_increments/

TL;dr vol repo'd car (not realizing we'd be moving halfway across the country unexpectedly a week later) we can reclaim for a very reasonable amount.  First payment made.  Second payment will be made Friday.  Have plane ticket to get car booked with points.

We made the first payment, and expect to be able to make the second Friday. We just got hit with a bill for $338.00, however, which we have paid but takes the gas and toll money to get the car back here.

I've confirmed that we can get temp tags to get it back here.  I've confirmed that we'll get the car back once the payment is made.  I've also confirmed we have nothing in the bank that will allow us to drive the car home.  My estimate for gas and tolls is $250.00.  Paypal should work (cutting it close time-wise to deposit into checking, but...) or I'd be thrilled to pieces with gas cards.  If I had gas cards for a national chain (Mobil, Sunoco, that sort of thing) I could avoid tolls. It would add several hours to the trip but it COULD be done.

Latest pay stub is at http://imgur.com/c8aTG.jpg and I can and will pay back any amount.  We've received a paper phone bill, so I can provide that for verification as well - please see the other thread for comments regarding that.

If I don't get the car on 12/26, I can't get the car - work closes down for a few days for Christmas, and the car must be picked up from the auction site (sale has been stopped based on payments made) during the week but not on Thursday because that's auction day.  This is my only chance to get the car - I can't call out of work because I'd lose the money, overtime shifts would not be overtime anymore (&lt; 40 hrs) and I'm a temp so I can't exactly just take a day off even with a good reason.

To sweeten the deal, I'll be headed out the I-70/I-80 corridor on the evening of 12/26 and the morning of 12/27 if I get the gas money, so if someone needs to get anywhere in the Albany-Newburgh-Scranton-Pittsburgh-Dayton-Indianappolis area (in that order, I'll be headed westbound) I'd be happy to give a ride.

I'm even more willing to prove legitimacy, or at that I exist where I say I exist - how about a picture of the payment stub from our first phone bill? (FWIW they charged the wrong installation fee and we've gotten it corrected, our phone bill is NOT that much!) http://imgur.com/pQm0Z

Please?  I know $250.00 is quite a bit of money, and I know it's the holiday season, but this is the one remaining piece we need to get our car back which is the one remaining piece we need to start putting our lives back together after we hit bottom.

We've gone to clinics and the ER instead of coming here for money for medical treatment (TMJ, anxiety, etc.).  We've gotten creative with what's in the cupboard and depended on family to try to make it.

TL;dr - can pay to redeem car.  cannot pay for gas to get it back here. (NY-IN).  Gas cards or donations of $250.00 would solve the problem, and I'll give (a) Redditor(s) a ride if they're headed the same way that day.

TL;dr #2 - I promised my wife I'd take care of her when we got married and I've not done the best job of that.  Headed in the right direction, but getting our car back would make me much more able to take care of her, get a better job, and get some health insurance with it.  The better job leading to insurance is becoming more crucial as time goes on.  I'm borrowing a car to get across town to work now, but I'm severely putting family in a bind by doing so and my job options are very limited based on the schedule I need to be on with the borrowed car.

Sorry for the wall of text.  

I'll even gladly share a PDF of my Southwest itinerary for getting to NY to get the car, and Facebook friend you, and...  whatever you want for verification.  

I've been selling plasma, as well, to get by.  It's not much money, but it's something.  It won't come up with the money we need for gas that quickly, though, for sure.

My aunt has also lost her job due to the hurricane and she does not know when she will be able to return, so this makes matters even worse. Plus with the vehicle destroyed, transportation for her daughter to go back and forth from work and school is very limited. My aunt, her daughter, and my fiancee's sister all live together and are barely getting by during this horrible time. 

I am trying to create a care package to send to at least make things a little better for the whole family.

Maybe Reddit could help me find them. The town of Purvis isn't that big (under 3,000 people) and I came with a distinctive name: Pallace. Maybe someone on here remembers me from when I was a little girl or knows my brother and sisters. Or maybe you've just got a great idea about how I could find them. I'm open for any kind of help.

Here's a little more info I left out in the beginning because it's heresy: My mom thinks when she adopted me she saw the last name Courtney on something involving one of my birth parents. The lawyer who did my adoption said my parents are dead. He said my sisters were adopted by a baptist family and my brother was taken in by family.

*Update*

I just got off the phone with my mother (the one who adopted me) and she says that my birth mother was 16 when she gave birth to me. She was a wild child according to the people who spoke with my mom and may have used drugs or alcohol. Apparently we all have different fathers and there was a delay in my adoption while they tracked down my particular father. 

Apparently we'd all been abandoned by her and were living with our grandfather who surrendered us when our grandmother had a stroke and he could no longer take care of us. 

*Update 2*

Because of the holiday in America it looks like I'll have better luck getting a hold of people tomorrow.  Someone suggested that the Baptist community may help out and I'm going to reach out tomorrow, hopefully I find people who aren't concerned that I'm not a Christian.  My biggest worry is that I won't be helped my them because I'm an Atheist.  I even took it off my Facrbook just in case.  I've never hidden who I am before.

I'll update any progress and I want to thank everyone who's given me an idea or words of support.

A fire started apparently from a cigarette ember out on their balcony. I had been inside for two hours, and did not notice the blaze, because instead of burning the deck, it burned into the wall itself, under the joist plate and into the stud wall of the downstairs neighbor's apartment, between the drywall and the stone facade of the outside. The neighbor came upstairs and asked me to stop whatever I was doing, because it was 'smoking him out.' There was no smoke in the apartment at this point. He told me of the smoke outside, and when I went to check, there was smoke coming from in between the cracks of the brick wall. Nothing was burning inside, just smoke pouring from the wall itself.

SO, we tried to fight the blaze with extinguishers while the fire department was on its way. It was ineffective, because we couldn't find a point of entry to get behind the wall. Fire department shows up, demolishes the wall in the apartment and the one below, fire everywhere. They fix the problem, of course, but the apartment is condemned, and they were not allowed to get any stuff out of it. The fire inspector deemed in an accident, and no charges are being filed, but they lost everything.
TL:DR- My friend's apartment burned down, and I am trying to get some funds together to help them get back up. It was my responsibility to watch the place, and it burned down.

However, what I will share that my mom has been 'out of the picture' for quite a while so he has raised me and my sister on his own which has caused him to have to make a few sacrifices - such as giving up on his own company that he was very passionate about, having a few mental breakdowns, and going into debt.
Throughout all of this, he has written many books, stories, and poems. Writing has always been his passion and he finally decided to self publish a book. He doesn't really expect anything from it, but he is very proud and it is quite an excellently written book and story.

I was wondering if you could help my sister and I to make the book bigger than he expects as a kind of thank-you for everything he has done and given up for my us.

TL;DR- dad self published, want to help him out as much as possible without him knowing

There is nothing I love. No activity I can't get enough of, that gets me through the bland parts of the day. Everything I do has a shelf-life, a timebomb that counts down to a *sigh* of apathy instead of a **boom.**   
My friends are artists, musicians, gamers, dancers, athletes. Irrelevant of what it is, they have some *thing* that they do better than others; that they like, *love*, to do.  
I don't love doing anything. I do everything my friends do, but I get sick of all of it. The games we play together get stale halfway through, and every outdoor adventure is preceded by a few hours of me agonizing over leaving the house. I feel like I was born to be the perfect image couch potato, producing nothing; putting no effort into the medium of my enjoyment. Just sitting and visually consuming, not even stopping to taste what's passing through my optical gullet.  
Ugh.  
I've loved **people**, only people that didn't love me, though. I think that's the requirement of my sincere love. I've been loved, and told those girls that ""I loved them too."" But I was lying.  
I felt a true connection with the writer of *Californication* when the main character's girlfriend accused him of hating himself so much, that he instantly deemed anybody who would love him an idiot.

",mseeke,28,4,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/meggz/please_help_me_help_my_friend_he_has_gone_crazy/,"6 weeks ago, my friend had a home, a good paying job, a three year old little boy and a wife who was 9 months pregnant. He came over my house in early October and was rambling fairly incoherently. He told me he had ""figured it all out"" and he was ""a modern day shaman"". He looked jumpy, like he was on a coke binge, but I know for a fact this wasn't the case. I had to leave on business, but I called our other friends to tell them to check in on him all week. It turned out, he freaked his family out too. His uncle, brother and mother decided to get him to a hospital. His uncle kind of yelled and bullied him into going. He went to the hospital, got checked in and promptly left. He thinks they were trying to pump him full of drugs and a whole other host of things. He called his wife to come pick him up, she told him she thinks he needs help. At this point he becomes completely obsessed with this ""wrong"" done to him. He denounces his marriage, disowns his family and essentially goes on the run. For the next couple weeks he blows in and out of the house in varying moods. He doesn't see anyone and work eventually fires him. It has now been 6 weeks and everything is gone. He missed the birth of his baby daughter and is now ""headed down south"" to become a boxer (he is over 30). His house will be foreclosed on, his kids will have no father, his wife has nothing but the unimaginable amount of debt he just racked up and I genuinely fear for his safety.
Twice now, his brother has tried to 302 him, but he doesn't meet the proper criteria. Basically, we have to watch him light himself on fire in the streets and we can't DO anything about it. He doesn't think he is crazy at all and just keeps insisting that ""he's got this"", but two minutes with the guy and you KNOW he isn't right. Do we just have to wait until something dramatically bad happens to get him the help he so desperately needs? What other recourse or resources are there? I am at a loss.

TL:DR My friend has gone crazy and I don't know how to help him.

Edit 1:  Thank you guys so much for sharing your advice and experiences.  It is really hard.  In some ways it feels like one of my best friends died.  Only I can still see his body. This is not the boy/man I have known for over 20 years.  The wait and see approach is pretty much what we have been doing.  Just try to make sure his wife and kids are ok and be there when he falls back to earth, but after 6 straight weeks of this, I am starting to lose hope and getting desperate.  I can't tell you guys how much I appreciate you sharing your stories, it really helps.

My friend Bryan, a fellow paramedic and father of two, was attacked in the parking lot of the Dodgers stadium because he was wearing his team's attire at an away game. Now he is in critical condition at an LA hospital and his prognosis is still unknown. The people who did this are despicable and I, along with almost 400 EMS coworkers, are sick with worry that we will never see our friend again. LAPD has security footage of the assault but they say there is nothing in the footage that identifies the assailants. Does anybody know anybody who was there and who is willing to come forward with information leading to the capture of the people responsible? With all the smart phones out there could anybody have taken a picture or video of the attack? 

Below is a link to one of many news articles about what happened. If anybody would like to help support Bryan's family while they endure this awful hardship at the end of the article there is a link to a credit union fund which is accepting donations.

Bryan is an amazing friend and caring paramedic, and more than a few people in our service area owe their lives to his talent and professional skill.

I hate begging, I really, really hate asking for help, but I'm at the end of my rope. I have four days to come up with four hundred dollars to pay the rent or else I get bounced to the curb. I've been living on a diet of oatmeal, ramen and V-8 juice for the past week (basically stuff that had been floating around my kitchen). I've even gone dumpster diving, but only managed to find a few cans of vegetables (which I was thankful for).

To give you a better picture, I'm a single white male in my early 30's. I cannot get unemployment anymore. I was involved in the home construction business for years (I was a Computer Aided Draftsman for a Land Surveyor), and whereas I didn't make a fortune, I made enough to get by and be comfortable. Then the housing boom stopped, and the recession hit. I managed to eke out a living on unemployment, and I quickly ate through my savings. I moved to a cheaper place after selling all the furniture and electronics I could. I reduced what I own down to what can fit in a few boxes and my computer, all of which I was able to fit in the back of a car and move in with friends. After I moved, my car decided to turn into a piece of immobile metal, which I sold for scrap to pay for rent. After a few months of not paying insurance on a non-existent vehicle, I received a letter telling me that my driver's license was suspended due to lack of insurance, and there was going to be a fee to get it reinstated.

Since then I've tried making stuff to sell on ebay, doing some contracting business (I made some money as an artist), and dumpster diving. I've turned in applications to every place within walking distance, and some places several times. At a local bagel shop, they pulled me aside and told me to stop coming in every week, because they had a stack of applications the size of a phone book from potential employees. I would go to college, however, getting there and back is possibly the largest hurdle.

My bank account was closed due to insufficient funds months ago, and my Paypal account has all of 23 cents. My account is simetradon13@yahoo.com, and I have no issues with posting that here, because the most someone can steal is less than a quarter.

I don't know what to do, other than hope that someone helps me find a reprieve. If I don't manage to come up with the cash in some miracle fashion, I'm out on the street. My parents don't have the funds to assist me, and they live too far away to do anything.

Edit: Thanks to those people that have contributed thus far, I'm going to walk down to the grocery store tomorrow and buy some actual food. 

I've also been told that perhaps I should provide a link to my gallery, since I'm a starving artist, to drum up business rather than take handouts. I know it's just a Deviant Art page, but I can't afford a real website, but, here you go: http://simetradon.deviantart.com/

Edit: Redditors are awesome, I just got back from walking down to the grocery store, and I bought some dried beans, rice, barley, peanut butter, potatoes, mac and cheese... I almost had to ""borrow"" a shopping cart to carry it back. 

I haven't reached the goal to pay the rent, but at least I won't starve. I'm currently sitting on $80 from contributions.

Edit: Two more days... I went to a church this morning, and spoke with the pastor after the service. He's going to ask around his congregation for anyone looking to hire.

Guillain-Barre is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks its nerves. As a result of his condition, Mike is temporarily unable to function, which can last up to 12 months. Currently, he is bedridden and will need to relearn how to perform basic tasks, like walking and other daily activities, through months of therapy. Mike is a self-employed building contractor, who has fulfilled his dream of owning his own business. The success of Suleski Builders has allowed Mike to provide for his wife and two children for many years. Unfortunately, by being diagnosed with this syndrome, he is unable to work until a full recovery is reached. This has left his wife and family with the financial burden that Mike previously had shouldered.

Mike is a loving father, husband, brother, son, uncle, and friend. To all who know him, they know Mike is not one to burden others with his need for help. One to always help others, even when unasked, Mike is now in need of assistance. In this trying time for family and friends, we ask that you please donate what you can in order for Mike to make a speedy and healthy recovery. For a man who is used to being on his feet and working with his hands each day, he cannot wait to be back to work doing what he loves and providing for his family.

He is a great guy who we hope will make a full recovery. Please help if you can!

My good friend Katie and her family are expecting their rainbow baby come early July.

**[Late Child Trigger:]** *If you don't know what a ""rainbow baby"" is- it's a term given to a baby that has come after a previous child has been lost- like a miscarriage, a still born or- like Katie- when her 2 year old passed away last year.*

Now, she does have baby items from her late 2 year old- but she doesn't want to use them, and nobody can blame her for that. I certainly don't.

They aren't rolling in the dough, and to make matters worse- her husbands job is kinda screwing him over with hours. So, since they aren't making much (she's obviously not working, as she's 9 months pregnant and won't be for a few months after baby), I've come here- where miracles are known to happen and people here are as good as they come. I'm not trying to give you a sob story, it's just a sad story. But- this baby will be a new beginning for them.

With that said, I've asked her to make up an amazon wishlist with things they and baby could use/need. So I will update with that as soon as she gets back to me.

She's not a reddit user, so she can't do this for herself. Even if she made an account- it wouldn't be over 90 days old. She's been nothing short of an amazing friend to me for over 5 years, so I wanted to give back to her somehow- maybe with someones help here.

**A little about Katie and her family:**

Katie is sort of a ""crunchy"" mom. She loves to babywear, loves to use cloth diapers, she likes the amber necklaces for the kids, she's a breastfeeding champ and an all around awesome Mom. They have twin boys who are turning 5 soon. H &amp; J. Her husband Taylor is a great cook. They're both geeky, awesome people. They like Dr. Who, Taylor likes WoW and the twins love Power Rangers. Their late son Rowan was the prettiest baby with his big blue eyes and bright blond hair. His death was a surprise- no one saw it coming. He was sick the night before and passed away the next morning while they were getting ready for the doctor visit. It was more than traumatic for the whole family. He was a sweet baby and they all miss him terribly. They never found out what happened to him, but doctors chalked it up to cardiac arrest.

**If you'd like proof, I'd be more than happy to provide it- just ask. I don't want to post anything super personal though, I think that's understandable.**

Thank you for reading, everyone. Thanks for always doing good things for people, and if you can help them out- thank you even more!

She had been ill for a long time, battling an insane combination of cancer, COPD, and Fibromyalgia. She was in debilitating pain, and was unable to care for herself, which meant that he had to be her full-time caretaker, and they had to live on her disability payments and whatever he could make as a blogger, which he worked tirelessly at. (He has previously written for Mashable and The Inquisitr to name a couple.) 

He was not only a blogger for as nearly as long as the word has existed, but also a podcaster and something of a mentor to many in the online tech community, and is an especially dear friend of our family. We'd like to be there for him, but being so far away(he is Canadian, we are in the US) and me being 26 weeks pregnant, we can't exactly pop over with a casserole and help with arrangements. 

What we'd like to do is help him cover the cremation expenses for his wife, so it's not something he has to worry about while he looks for work again and deals with her passing. She didn't wish for a burial so there's not crazy expenses with that, she just wanted to be cremated to she could be back home with him. We have set a goal of $2,000 to make sure it is covered fully, and would love any help people could give us to reach this goal, whether it's a donation to the cremation fund or just even passing the link along via Facebook. Literally ever dollar helps, and we are putting in the first $200 ourselves to kick it off. 

Thanks for reading, and any help you can give us, even if it's just passing the word along.
