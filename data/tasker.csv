The sump pump in my basement was running continuously and after watching the water levels with the pump disabled I figured I'd have about ten minutes to start my generator and get the pump back online before the sump filled with water.  I was running on fumes and with no way of knowing whether the power was out if I fell asleep I set up a super-simple Tasker profile to raise an alarm if the phone was not on a/c power.

Around 5:30am this morning the alarm went off without a hitch as the power failed.  It did end up coming back on minutes later, but if it hadn't I would have still managed a dry basement.

1369285937.0,69,self.tasker,1evxyi,"My ""Smart Wi-Fi"" profile",c00ller,83,14,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1evxyi/my_smart_wifi_profile/,"I've seen plenty of simple auto-turn-off-wifi-after-disconnecting profiles online, but none that I could find were really smart enough to stop as soon as connection was regained within the time limit, nor did they include an interactive notification that displayed the status of the countdown. So, I finally recreated something that I made back when I used AutomateIt.

Given that you are connected to a Wi-Fi network, if you are disconnected for whatever reason, the following notification will show.

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/EnDNEYm.png)

The ""Turn off"" button turns off Wi-Fi immediately while the ""Cancel"" button stops the countdown process and lets you keep Wi-Fi on, displaying a Toast message that says ""Wi-Fi will be kept on!"". Both buttons dismiss the notification. If a Wi-Fi connection is regained during the countdown, the task is stopped, notification is dismissed and a new notification message shows ""Wi-Fi reconnected!"" and disappears immediately. If a Wi-Fi connection is not regained in 60 seconds, Wi-Fi is turned off, the notification is dismissed, and a new notification message is displayed: ""You left Wi-Fi on, idiot"". Note: the profile considers the case where Wi-Fi is initially turned on and always begins as disconnected; the notification will not show until AFTER disconnecting from an already established connection.

Changeable things:


* Timeout - To change the timeout, go to the task called ""Wi-Fi Countdown, Enable Smart-WiFi 3"" and change the Variable Set %cdown value to the number of seconds you wish the countdown to last (it's up to you if you wish to improve the %cdown formatting if &gt; 60 seconds... that would require some annoying math and work I think, i.e., converting ""90 seconds"" to display as ""1:30"").
* Notification message after countdown finishes - Default is ""You left Wi-Fi on, idiot"". Go to the same task as above and find the last action. Change or remove as desired.


[Download](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/149342/Android/Tasker/Smart__Wi_Fi.prj.zip) 
Instructions: Download, extract the .xml file and put it somewhere on your phone's sdcard. In Tasker, go to the PROFILES tab and long-press the bottom left home icon &gt; Import &gt; find the .xml file.
**NOTE:** I've never imported a project before, but the **1st and 4th Profiles should be set to ON at all times** if you want this to work. **ALSO:** long press on each of the four profiles, go to settings, and **make sure Restore Settings is unchecked**.

1370652057.0,57,self.tasker,1fweb1,[How To] Connect to wolfram alpha via API to pull important event anniversaries for today and displays them on a minimalistic text widget every day,PinkyThePig,64,7,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1fweb1/how_to_connect_to_wolfram_alpha_via_api_to_pull/,"So let me start this post by first [directing you to my first post](http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1fbmxm/how_tomaking_api_calls_to_wolfram_alpha/) about Wolfram Alpha if you do not know how to get connected to their API.

With that out of the way what follows is my Tasker task and associated things and afterwards will be a largeish explanation. In addition you may notice there are a handful of 'extra' steps. I tend to add those in to make everything more user friendly and if I ever decide to I can start using Tasker App Factory on them with as few modifications as possible.

Make a profile that runs at 1am. (From 01:00 To 01:00) Have that profile run this task.

1. If &gt; %Wolfapi ! Set
2. Variable Query &gt; Title: Wolfram API &gt; Variable: %Wolfapi &gt; Default: Please insert API Key &gt; Timeout: 525 seconds
3. End If
4. If &gt; %Wolfapi ~ Please insert API Key
5. Variable Clear &gt; Variable %Wolfapi
6. Goto &gt; Type: Action Number &gt; Number: 1
7. End If
8. HTTP Get &gt; Server:Port: http://api.wolframalpha.com &gt; Path: v2/query?input=%DATE&amp;appid=%Wolfapi&amp;podstate=NotableEventForDate\_\_Show anniversaries&amp;podstate=NotableEventForDate\_\_More&amp;includepodid=NotableEventForDate &gt; Timeout: 20 &gt; Mime Type: text/xml __(IMPORTANT: There is a space between ""Show"" and ""anniversaries"")__
9. Variable Set &gt; %Wolfraw to %HTTPD
10. Variable Split &gt; %Wolfraw &gt; Splitter: &lt;plaintext&gt;
11. Variable Split &gt; %Wolfraw2 &gt; Splitter: &lt;/plaintext&gt;
12. Variable Set &gt; %Wolfans to %Wolfraw21
13. Variable Search Replace &gt; Variable: %Wolfans &gt; Search: \&amp;apos; &gt; Replace With: '
14. Minimalistic Text &gt; Configuration: Wolftxt1 = %Wolfans

After that make a Minimalistic Text widget 4x2. Add a single Locale Variable. Name said variable Wolftxt1. From here everything else is optional but you can change font size etc to your liking. I then use widget locker to add minimalistic text to [my lock screen](http://imgur.com/2g54JPr.jpg).

Now for the explanation. Lines 1-7 are basically fluff. They are completely optional as you can always manually add said variable in the variable listing in Tasker.

So Line 8 deserves its own paragraph. It took much reading through their [API document](http://products.wolframalpha.com/docs/WolframAlpha-API-Reference.pdf) to get this pulled perfectly. The relevant 'options' podstate and includepodid are referenced on 14 and 23 respectively. Podstate achieves the same thing as clicking 'more' in the top right of a 'pod' and having it in there twice is the equivalent of clicking said more button two times. Includepodid makes it so that ONLY the anniversary values are pulled. So instead of getting a pod containing phases of the moon or holidays I ONLY receive the anniversaries pod. One other note about said action is debugging the text in this field was probably half of my time spent on this project. 1 Typo? Not so bad. 2 Typos? This is getting annoying. 3 Typos? WTF do you mean I forgot to include a space! ARGGGGGGG!!! I had 3 typos that took me probably an hour to find in the monster block of text. End my suffering, please.

Lines 9-12 are just pulling the text from the XML response returned. In the future I may add error messages in here if say wolfram isn't reachable or if there is a bad API key etc.

Line 13 is needed (and more may be needed) as when wolfram returns data with an apostrophe in it it actually sends \&amp;apos; instead of an actual apostrophe.

Line 14 displays the actual events for that day. Conveniently wolfram sends them with an 'enter' at the end of each line so no splitting or further manipulating of the data is needed for it to display well.

Enjoy!

Edit: Fixed apos at end.

Edit2: [Here is an xml dump if you wanted to import.](http://pastebin.com/eA4ZdxG8)

EDIT3: Fixed my code. Line 13 is now:  
13. Variable Search Replace &gt; Variable: %Wolfans &gt; Search: \&amp;apos; &gt; Replace With: '  
instead of:  
13. Variable Search Replace &gt; Variable: %Wolfans &gt; Search: &amp;apos; &gt; Replace With: '

*The Empowering Quote*
    “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.”

First, create a variable named %Flash. This can be done in the ""VARS"" tab in tasker.  Note: it is important that you have a capital F, so that the variable is global and works for multiple tasks. 

Now, three profiles need to be created for this to work.  The first one I named ""flashlight shake"".  Create a new profile and go to events. Now click on sensor, then shake.  You can customize the axis, sensitivity and duration to your liking. I picked a sensitivity and duration of medium to prevent accidental activation.  Now create a new task to go along with this profile.  Go to add a new action --&gt; third party --&gt; TeslaLED.  Under set, switch it from off to toggle. Now click the If box. Under If, type ""%Flash"" in the left text box and select match (~) in between the two text fields.  Now on the right side type ""1"".   This Profile and associated task is now down.  

For the next profile I named it ""Flashlight Screen On"".  Go to Event --&gt;  Display --&gt; Display On.  Now make a new task and name it something along the lines of ""Flash = 1"".  Go to add a new action --&gt; Variables --&gt; Variable Set.  Under name put ""%Flash"" and under To, put ""1"".   This Profile and associated task is now done.  

For the last Profile I named it ""Flashlight Screen Unlocked"".  Go to Event --&gt; Display --&gt; Display Unlocked.  Now make a new task and name it something along the lines of ""Flash = 0"".  Go to add a new action --&gt; Variables --&gt; Variable Set.  Under name put ""%Flash"" and under To, put ""0"".   This Profile and associated task is now done.  

The way this is set up is that by shaking the phone(only when screen is on), the flashlight profile will try to turn the flashlight on.  It will only activate the flashlight if %Flash has a variable of one. And with the other two profiles, %Flash will be set to one when the screen turns on and it will be set back to 0 when the screen is unlocked.  To turn off the flashlight, simply shake the phone again while on the lock screen.   

Feel free to post and questions, concerns, or improvements.

I do hope no one takes offense to this. The intention is not to kick out beginners, but to make it easier for experienced users to cooperate. Hopefully, the forum will produce new techniques and things that can be made into more beginner-friendly tutorials and such later on.

You don't want to start disabling things, stripping it almost to the core to get some battery or performance out of it. Here is how to save features and battery.

Tools: Tasker, Tasker App Factory, Secure Settings; BetterBatteryStats or alternative.

1. Find the programs you use that cause wakelocks. Use whatever app to identify the wakelocks. I use BetterBatteryStats. For me it was Google Maps, Google Currents that were causing wakelocks.


2. Create the primary Task that will shutdown these apps when screen is off in Tasker:

Context: Display State ON (invert) 
Task: Disable Apps - Google Current, Google Maps. (Use Secure Settings Package State).


3. Now, create a Task that will launch the app. Do this for all your apps.


Task: Enable App - Google Maps (Use Secure Settings Package State).
Task: Launch App - Google Maps.


4. Export the Task by creating an APP using Tasker App Factory. 


5. Install APK of your new Task.


6. Done. Enjoy greater battery life by getting rid of those wakelocks.

I understand, it takes either a programmatic mind or a lot of tinkering. Let's show everyone all the uses we have discovered and maybe combine some of those to form new ideas!

Here is my list (from a thread yesterday) of most of the things I use Tasker for. If anyone wants profile details just ask!

   1. Long press search (new feature) pops up a menu with my top used apps and I have one of the icons represent a task which opens a menu of my top used tasks. Allows me to toggle wifi/bluetooth/gps or run any of my tasks WHILE another program is active.
   2. Bluetooth turns off 15 seconds after bluetooth disconnect with notification announcing this.
   3. When battery level &lt;15% turn off wireless, auto-sync, and change background to black w/ notification.
   4. During 11PM to 7AM turn off wifi, auto-sync, and notification volume
   5. Turn on GPS when My Tracks, Cardiotrainer, and Navigation are opened
   6. When Phone Offhook (calling someone) set variable %OFFHOOK 1 when Phone Idle clear %OFFHOOK (so I can check for this to stop some profiles from running while on phone)
   7. When I unlock my phone write the time and battery level to file. (To observe how compulsively I check my phone.)
   8. When I leave my home location start a popup asking if I want to set variable %CARMODE
   9. When %CARMODE is set: Read texts, callers, and email subjects using SayMyName plugin. Enable bluetooth and GPS.
   10. Display rotation off for certain apps.
   11. Hourly chime and 30 minute gong. Set brightness to 0 hourly (since Touchwiz notification swipe changes brightness w/ Galaxy S)
   12. Use a Cell Near profile to set variable %NEARHOME and another profile uses a Wifi Near profile which checks only when %NEARHOME is set (prevents turning on wifi near far from home).
   13. Bluetooth widget which toggles bluetooth and sets widget icon based on state.
   14. Widget to turn on my computer using the Wake On Lan locale plugin when I am connected to home wifi.
   15. Widget to take a picture using the camera. (saves time from having to open the app, take picture, see preview...Can also put pictures taken for a specific project into a folder)
   16. Every 15 minutes: Menu task asks if I have been on task or not. Depending on answer it opens another menu task of productive/distracting tasks I routinely do. Sound also plays Mario Death = off task Level complete = on task. Finally all this information is put into a text file.
   17. Set up desktop notifications of phone calls, texts, and battery state using Android-notifier plugin and Growl for Windows. Know someone is calling before you hear the ringtone!
   18. Use a Task countdown widget to track cooking time or any other eggtimer task. The task I attach it to simply raises the media volume, plays a tone and vibrates, then sets media volume back to default.

Protip #1: When creating a menu to select Apps or a Task, don't use text labels. Also download some of the different [icon packs](http://tasker.wikidot.com/icon-index). Extract them to /sd/Tasker/.icn/ (put blank file titled .nomedia if you don't want them in gallery) These are useful for on/off icons of different colors for widgets. 

Protip #2: Often, people have multiple tasks they want to run when a location condition is met (E.g. Home). Have that condition set a variable %ATHOME. Have other tasks/conditions check if this variable is set. This allows for practically unlimited apps to run based on certain conditions.

It was actually surprisingly easy (took 10 minutes tops to get back a resultant text file) but there is apparently quite a lot of stuff that gets returned and was wondering if anyone was wanting to take this further as I personally don't have a use for it at this time but it would be interesting to see where it goes. Here's the basics.

1. You need to set up an API account at wolfram alpha. Super simple, takes 5 minutes and a captcha answer. Can be done [here](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/signin.html).

2. Generate an API key. This should be a long string of gibberish.

3. Make a task that does an HTTP Get to:  
http://api.wolframalpha.com/v2/query?input=%INPUT&amp;appid=[Insert_your_app_ID_here] &gt; Mime Type: text/xml &gt; Output File: outputdump.txt


The Variable %INPUT controls what question you ask wolfram. Make sure that when you set the variable the spaces, if you have any, are replaced by + signs. This outputs essentially the entire wolfram page in an easy to variable split xml file.

That's it! You now have a huge amount of text to wade thru and variable split, have fun! :)

Bonus Round: There is significantly more functionality available such as setting assumptions (which narrows your results) which starts on page 7 of their API document. So if you only plan to use wolfram for a very specific task you would probably want to add that in to your query.",,False,self,t5_2s0ro,False,,,True,t3_1fbmxm,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1fbmxm/how_tomaking_api_calls_to_wolfram_alpha/,

This one is a little tricky but here is what you are going to need.

1. Chrome (OS or Browser)
2. Tasker (duh ;P)
3. PHP server (apache,nginx,lightppd all have plugins)
4. Internet connection.

Alright. First start off by creating a new profile.
Select *""Event &gt;Phone &gt; Received Text""* You can then fill it in with whom ever you wish to receive notifications for or leave blank for all texts.

Next you are going to want to create a new task.
Select *""Net &gt; HTTP Post""* This is where you are going to fill in all the info for your server, and the path will end with the PHP script we will make in a minuet. In the data box place these values. 

**person=$SMSSRN - ($SMSRF)**

**msg=$SMSRB**


Be sure to save all this.

Now let's focus on the PHP side of things. 
Grab [this](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ui7egrgym4zozxi/SMS.php?m) file.

(You can rename it. Just make sure it's a .php file)

Now you need to place it on your website and go back to Tasker and make sure to fill in the *Server and Port* correctly.

Now in in order for Chrome to display all this you are going to need a few more files.

1372834005.0,25,self.tasker,1hjx4m,"[Partial How To] Home automation with tasker, push notifications to android, and a doorbell that shows you who is knocking!",PinkyThePig,33,8,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1hjx4m/partial_how_to_home_automation_with_tasker_push/,"So while tinkering tonight to figure out a doorbell unlock system I am now part way through and figured someone else may have a use for this chunk of my DIY home automation doorbell!

My final goal for all of this is to have a raspberry pi, touch screen, camera and motorized lock/unlock mounted to my door with a super sweet button on the outside to act as a doorbell. Touch screen is irrelevant to this particular project, it is just there to pull more use out of the pi for other things. (Maybe even a speaker to tell them to come in or access denied!)

The way it would work is upon pressing the doorbell it sends a notification to my android which initiates a popup with a picture of the person ringing the doorbell with an option to do nothing / unlock the door / retake the picture. So far I have the notification part taken care of, I am currently working on how to do a secure file transfer of the picture and the rest of it but I figured others in this forum may have a use for just this chunk of the application for your own servers etc.

The more indepth explanation for this portion is that upon someone pressing the doorbell the pi would initiate a python script which sends a notification to my android via NMA. Tasker then automatically takes that notification and does something.

Links:  
Library for sending push notification: https://github.com/uskr/pynma  
Notify my Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.usk.app.notifymyandroid  
Tasker: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm  
You would need to install the python library from git into the same folder where your script is stored (other possiblities for this but this will do for now) via:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install git
    (cd to your desired directory for installing all of this)
    git clone http://github.com/uskr/pynma.git

This will make a directory inside that folder starting with pynma. You will want to make your python script inside the first pynma folder where test.py is.

With this portion installed quickly switch over to your android phone and get NMA and make an account. On the website www.notifymyandroid.com you will want to login to your account and generate an API key. We will need it in a few seconds.

Then we want to switch back to the pi and create this python script:

~~from pynma import PyNMA~~

    import pynma
    doorapi = pynma.PyNMA( ""insert your api key here"" )
    doorapi.push(""Door"", ""Doorbell"", ""Ding! Dong!"", ""/picture/of/person/ringing/door.jpg"")

The first 3 fields on the last line are the different fields that display on the push. The 4th is a URL. Can make an actual URL to allow tapping of push to open your browser, otherwise can be any 'hidden' variable you want to pass to tasker.

Now switch back to the phone and in tasker we want to make a new profile with Event &gt; System &gt; Intent Received and in the action field fill in: com.usk.app.notifymyandroid.NEW_NOTIFICATION

leave all else default.
Make a new task called NMA

Now from this task the possibilities are endless. You can reference all of the push fields via: %app (field 1), %event (field 2), %desc (field 3), %url (field 4), %prio (priority, unused in my example).

From here if you wanted to allow your phone to react to multiple things such as doorbell or a security alarm tripped you would want to make multiple If/End If under the task such as

    If: %app ~ Door  
    &gt;Do stuff here  
    &gt;Stop  
    End If  
    If: %app ~ Security  
    &gt;Do stuff here  
    &gt;Stop  
    End If  

That is as far as I have gotten so far. The button I have mostly figured out, I just need to finish wading through a script I got online that contained it and then repurpose it. I will post once I figure it out and have time.

Here is a plug to the relevant subreddits if you wanted to browse/contribute! /r/raspberry_pi /r/learnpython and (semi-dead) /r/homeautomation

Maybe some of you have encountered the following problem: you have multiple profiles that can set the phone to silent mode and turn the ringer back on in their exit actions, they overlap, so the ringer turns on when it's supposed to be turned off. For example, you have separate calendars for lectures and seminars, they overlap and the ringer turns back on when you have your seminar.

There is a solution: semaphores.

So how did I set up these profiles?

First, I have a profile that clears the semaphore on boot. Condition: Device Boot, enter action: set %SEMA to 0. This is to ensure that the variable doesn't contain any garbage.

Then I have a profile with the condition ""Variable value %SEMA Math:Greater than 0"". The enter task is ""Silent mode: Vibrate"", the exit task is ""Silent mode: Off"".

And whenever I want a profile to silence the phone then turn the sound back on in the exit task, I add a ""Variable add"" action to the enter task that adds 1 to the %SEMA, and a ""Variable subtract"" to the exit task that subtracts 1. These tasks don't change the silent mode settings themselves, the semaphore-checking profile does it for them.

Of course, this works with other settings too, like WiFi, but I have only set it up for the silent mode since that's the only profile where I have overlapping profiles.

I hope some of you will find it useful.",,False,self,t5_2s0ro,False,,,True,t3_g9pje,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/g9pje/a_trick_ive_learned_in_programming_classes/,

For me, I wanted this to activate only when I'm on my bluetooth. That said, I have multiple bluetooth devices including for media and would hardly want to have a private text be read over the speakers while I have company, for instance. So I started off with this profile:

If Bluetooth (insert MAC address here) is connected

+

I'm not on a call

+

Received a new text

This fires up a task called 'new text BT'.



**New Text BT**

1. Start Autovoice Continuous (I want it to start before I need to speak so it's up and running in time)

2. Say 'One New Text Message'

3. wait 10 seconds

4. AutoVoice Continuous Stop

First off, I used Continuous because it's non-intrusive. If I'm with clients or whatever else, I don't need my phone making the Google Voice Search sound. If I say 'playback' within 10 seconds of getting the text, it fires up another task called Read Newest Text.

**Read Newest Text**

1. Say 'SMS From %SMSRN (This is the name of the person who sent the most recent text) %SMSRB (This is the body of the most recent text). '

2. Say 'Would you like to reply?'

3. Get Voice (with a timeout of 10 seconds).

4. IF %VOICE = yes (for some reason, a lower case Y is important) then run task 'respond to text'

Get Voice takes whatever you say and saves it as a variable named %VOICE. This makes it easy to us the IF command that's found in many actions.

**Respond to text**

1. Say 'Please speak your response'

2.Get Voice 30 seconds

3. Variable Set %HeardSMS to %VOICE - This takes whatever is in %VOICE and saves it to a new variable called %HeardSMS. This is important so that if %VOICE gets overwritten you don't lose the message you just spoke

4. Say 'Send Message %HeardSMS (body of the text) to %SMSRN (the name of the sender of the last received text)?

5. Get Voice with a timeout of 10 seconds

6. Send SMS %HeardSMS to %SMSRN **ONLY IF** %VOICE = yes (this is why it was important to save the text body as %HeardSMS)

7. Clear the variable %VOICE (probably not necessary, do it for peace of mind)

8. Say 'Did you want to edit or cancel?' **ONLY IF** %VOICE doesn't equal 'yes'

9. Get Voice for 10 seconds

10. Stop Task IF %VOICE = cancel

11. Go to Action 1 (beginning of this task) if %VOICE = edit

12. Go to Action 8 (ask if you want to edit or cancel) if %VOICE doesn't equal 'edit' or 'cancel'

http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1evxyi/my_smart_wifi_profile/

I liked the idea and functionality of this profile, but wanted to make it a little more functional and clean.

Features:

* 1 profile for the Wi-Fi and 2 for the Bluetooth -_- (If anyone knows how to monitor if bluetooth is connected or not like the %WIFII variable, but for bluetooth WITHOUT using a entire profile to set a custom variable. Please let me know. 

* Notification with sound pops up after 10 seconds of no connection. Prompts for leaving Wi-Fi/Bluetooth on or turning off

* If connected within 10 seconds of Wi-Fi/Bluetooth being on, stops task and gives a flashes in your notification bar that you have reconnected. [This doesn't happen](http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1evxyi/my_smart_wifi_profile/ca4h1dk)

* If Wi-Fi/Bluetooth reconnects while the notification is counting down , the notification will go away and flashes that you have reconnected. (Example is you are out of range, Wi-Fi disconnects, 10 seconds pass, notification pops up, you come back in rage and wifi connects, counting notification is dismissed and flashes you have reconnected.)

* If countdown timer from default of 30 seconds +10 runs out, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth is disabled and flashes that Wi-Fi/Bluetooth has been disabled.

Download Instructions: Download the file and put it somewhere on your phone's sdcard. In Tasker, go to the PROFILES tab and long-press the bottom left home icon &gt; Import &gt; find the .xml file.

Extra Fun!

I also made a simple flashlight profile. You shake your phone, light comes on (screen must be on due to tasker, no need to be unlocked) and shake it again to turn off the light. I find it very usefull and alot simpler than trying to find an application or push a button (Note: You must manually set %Flashlight to off, it will work after that also it sometimes turns on accidentally, settings are on lowest sensititiy and I have my Gesture Match Radius set to 1.0) Uses [TeslaLED Flashlight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.flashlight&amp;hl=en) app.

1364891673.0,24,self.tasker,1bi6iz,Can someone answer some Tasker questions for a noob?I have quite a few questions.. Specifically about variables..,RedemptionX11,26,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1bi6iz/can_someone_answer_some_tasker_questions_for_a/,"First off I just want to say that Tasker has blown me away with its abilities. Now, I'm not an idiot, but a lot of the wikis and walk throughs have gone right over my head. Especially the ones talking about variables, splitting them, etc. I'm the type of learner that needs more than just a text telling me something, I need someone to sort of walk me through how something works once before I can grasp it on my own. So, this will probably be a wall of text by the time I'm done. If you're awesome enough to read through everything it would be awesome if you could provide me some noob-level insight. You don't even have to answer everything, just tell me what you know because I think anything will help me learn more at this point. 

I think I get the basic concept of variables..Like Receiving a text is an event, the sender of the text is the variable. But it's creating variables that I don't quite get. For instance, if I wanted to create a profile to have a different ring+vibration combination for when someone not in my contact list calls me so I can tell it's a strange number without looking.. I would need to create a variable for unknown phone numbers. To make that, is it as simple as typing in %unknownnumber as a variable? Or is there some certain way I'm supposed to write it so Tasker knows what I mean?     

There is a variable for receiving emails and the like, but I think I read that those variables only apply to the K9 email client. So how would I make the same set of variables apply to the Gmail email client?   
     - Going a little further on this one, I have two gmail accounts, one for school/job searching and the other for personal use. I'd like to different notification sounds for each account. So, I would need to split the Gmail variable I mentioned before so it would be different for each account, correct? How would I do that?     
Also, What's the difference between monitored and dynamic variables? I assume dynamic are ones you can change, like call volume.    

I also see that you can assign values to variables. All I've gathered from that is that a value =1 means the variable is ""true"" and value=0 means ""untrue""... or something like that. Is that correct?    

Now.. What are ""Arrays"" and how are they used? Again, after looking at the wikis I still couldn't quite wrap my head around what they are and what they're used for.   

My last question (for the moment) is what exactly do the ""tasks"" actions do and what do they mean? It seems pretty obvious what 'stop' does (stops the context?) but the rest I don't get. Anchor, else, end for, end if, for, goto, if, return, wait... I just keep shaking my head at these and how useless they currently are to me because I can't figure out what exactly they do and how to incorporate them into a profile.   


That's all for now. Thanks in advance!

https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B2JwsmFj5Ev-MUpxVmZXNEp4UHc

Description text file for project is at: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pLEn7QxUkg812fqZZ_96T20yKYcISKs6X7BiRApjmno/edit

/u/UncleMidriff explained a very awesome task he had for controlling music with a wave of his hand in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/12vkif/tasker_lets_share_tasker_profiles_with_stepbystep/c6z5p89). I took the idea and beefed it up.

This is specifically set up for music playing through Google Play Music App. Pandora and Amazon MP3 ~~aren't controllable via the media control actions so I couldn't add them in~~ are tricky to control with Play Music on the system.

The project only runs when Play Music is on or recently turned off and as such is designed to always be enabled. That said, there is a task included that toggles it on and off. The toggle task also has a disabled notification bar feature so enable that too if you'd like to see it in the status bar.

Controls:

- 1 wave will play or pause and say the correct term ""play"" or ""pause""
- 2 waves plays the next track and says ""next""
- 3 waves plays the previous track and say ""previous""
- 4 or more waves acts as a cancel and says the number of waves you did

Controls will works when:

- Play Music app is in the foreground
- Play Music app is in the background with music playing, the icon will be in the status bar
- If you pause with the app in the background actively playing music, the mode will stay on for 2 minutes before disabling.
- If you are in a call, normal behavior of pausing and restarting takes place. If you are paused and on the 2 minute timer, the project automatically gets disabled during a call. This prevents you hearing ""Play"" when you put the phone up to your ear.

**What this does:**  
When you turn off your screen, it will check to see the total amount of data that has been used. 15 seconds after turning your screen off, it will once again check the total amount of data that has been used. It will then find the difference between these two values to determine how much data has been used *since you turned off the screen*. If it is less than 15 KB(or whatever amount you chose), it will turn off Wifi. However, if the screen is on(meaning that you turned it *back on* within 15 seconds), it will abort.

Example use: say you want your tablet to go into airplane mode whenever the screen is off. However, you don't want it to go into airplane mode if you are streaming music or downloading a file.

To do something similar except with mobile data instead of wifi, use the same actions, but for the shell command instead use:  
`cat sys/class/net/rmnet0/statistics/rx_bytes`  

This is, of course, only a basic framework and can be extended and modified to suit your needs.

[Here are the instructions](https://gist.github.com/ravicious/5280241). The recipe on my phone is too messed up to be exported (tasks have Polish names and so on).

You may have to modify the `Say the time` task, because here in Poland we have a 24-hour clock and the `%TIME` variable outputs something like `13.37`, so I had to split it by the dot.

This is pretty simple, requirements:

* Static IP or domain name
* Wake-on-LAN enabled PC


**VERY Basic guide for enabling Wake-on-LAN (WoL)**

* Step 1

Check you BIOS for a setting called Power on by PCEI/PCI or something similar. This will enable your NIC to wake up the PC. Every motherboard is different so check you manual.

* Step 2

For Windows 7, go to Device Manager, open properties for you network adapter, go to power management and look for a setting called Wake on Magic Packet or something similar. Enable it.

* Step 3

Setup port forwarding to forward port 9 (default port), or which ever port you want to use, to your computer.

There are plenty of more in-depth guides online. Note: this usually only works for computers in suspended state or hibernation. Luckily motherboard (ASUS Sabertooth z77) happens to support WoL from a full off state.

**Setting up your phone**

Install and setup this: [Wol Wake on Lan Wan](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benfinnigan.wol&amp;hl=en), it is pretty straight forward and has support for tasker.

In tasker:

Create a profile (name: Work) with a location context for whereever you work. Setup the accuracy settings depending on if you want to use GPS. I just use my mobile network with a radius of 1km. You can also add a time/date context for the general hours you work, doesn't have to be the exact hours, you could leave work early and it would still work.

* Add a task -&gt; tasker -&gt; Profile Status -&gt; Name: Home, Set: On

* Add a task -&gt; tasker -&gt; Profile Status -&gt; Name: Work, Set: Off

Create another profile (name: Home) with a location context for whereever you live.

* Add a task -&gt; tasker -&gt; Profile Status -&gt; Name: Home, Set: Off

I figured that someone else in the world might like the ability to upload things to Dropbox using Tasker, so I put in the android market.

It currently costs $1.49, but just remember that if you choose to buy it, you're helping a college kid make some money in his spare time :)

Some features of the plugin:

* Uploads files in the /sdcard/dropbox folder that you specify (I may later support files not in that folder, but I'm still figuring out the UI for that...)

* Supports Tasker variable substitution (So you can upload files with the date in their name, for example)

* Uses the real Dropbox API, so it never stores your password, just an access token.

* It actually works. I played with a few things on the market before, and didn't have much success with getting them to upload things automatically.

* Only uploads when you tell it to - it doesn't make a background service that wastes battery.

* Again, makes you feel good for supporting a college kid :P

Also, I'm considering adding support in a future version that detects in the file you've selected for upload is a folder, and if so, recursively upload all files in that directory. Would you guys be interested in that feature?

1365095746.0,21,self.tasker,1bo751,How To: Manage Tasker contexts for multiple devices from a single device,HateComics,23,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1bo751/how_to_manage_tasker_contexts_for_multiple/,"If you're like me and you have several android devices, phone, tablet etc. that share pretty much the same rules and contexts and you're tired of replicating the same rules from one device to another or you're tired of making small adjustments per device try this method; but first an example:

*I have a Nexus 4 - Primary Device
*I have a Nexus 7 - Secondary Device.

I create all my contexts on my Nexus 4, but copy it over to my Nexus 7 to save time via the restore method. The problem with this is that it replicates the context on both devices which I then have to manually amend every time I restore to my secondary device using my primary.

For instance: I want my Nexus 4 to disable wifi when I leave the house, but I like my Nexus 7 to stay connected to wifi at all times. Copying the tasker profiles from Nexus 4 to Nexus 7 won't work; since it'll replicate the same actions. Here is how you do it.


Tools Needed: Backup tool like Carbon, Titanium etc. Tasker. (I want to say DataSync, because it had the best transparent restore method, but DataSync doesn't have one way Sync, and it has seriously messed me up in the past - AVOID at all costs). 

1. You need to identify each device as unique, so set the Device ID as follows:

1.a - Declare Variable: DeviceModelID
1.b - Create a new Profile:

Profile: ""Screen On""
State: Device Screen ON
Task: Set Variable 'DeviceModelID' to %DEVTID

The above sets the Device ID that is unique. Look at your DeviceModelID variable, it should be filled with a number like: ""32323232"", or whatever else; Take a note of this value - You will need it for stage 2. You have to do stage one manually on both devices in order to get the unique %DEVTID.

Once complete, you can now do the rest on your primary device: In my case it's my Nexus 4, and my Tablet is secondary device.

2. You need to create a profile for your device that you can re-use over and over, as follows:

Profile: Nexus 4
State: Variable DeviceModelID matches value ""32323232"" (This is the value set in stage one)
Task: STOP (command STOP)

3. Done. You can now do all your Tasker related activities on your primary device, in my case ""Nexux 4""; then use a backup tool like Carbon to restore to your secondary device.


Now, in order to use the above, you add a state that equals the name of the active Profile (%PACTIVE). For example:

Say I want to create a new Context for Wifi to turn off when you leave the house:


Profile: Disable Wifi
State: %PACTIVE = ""Nexus 4""
Task: wifi off


The above will turn off wifi on my Nexus 4 only. This way you can manage multiple devices from One device.

* The first stage with screen on is required; the reason for this is that the variable was set on your primary device as 32323232 - when you go to restore on your secondary device, the same variable is set again (32323232). Turning the screen on then off sets the variable of the new device at all times so it's always up-to-date.

Now you need to create a filter in Gmail. It should filter all messages from @txt.voice.google.com

Now make sure you check skip inbox/archive, mark as read, apply label ""Google Voice"", and exclude from smart labeling. Now check the forward option, and set the email as yourphonenumber@youcarrierspecificadress.com You can get you carrier specific email address by going to http://www.emailtextmessages.com/ or by sending an sms from your messaging app to your email.

Turn off your notifications in your messaging app.

Now create a profile in Tasker. The trigger in when any SMS/MMS is received (my carrier sends emails as MMS, but if I remember right verizon had separate addresses for txt/pix). Then set the action as whatever your timed data/sync check action is. You can just import my battery saving profile, it's already set up. But keep in mind you'll need to switch the variable on somehow. I use a scene with a button that runs the toggle task.


This profile will turn off auto-sync/data/wifi when the screen is off and enable it and force sync when the screen is on. It also enables and force syncs every 30 minutes. You will need the Secure Settings and Synker plugins.

I don't know if this is how you actually cross-post, I'm dumb.

I love Tasker. Every week, I realise it can sneak into another little nook of my life and make it easier, cooler, or just more interesting. Currently, I'm building a sort of 'virtual assistant' around a complex set of tasks, but I've hit a bit of a roadblock.

My calendar is a huge part of the way I use my phone. I have a schedule that varies from day to day, and often hour to hour.

My first grand plan for my assistant is, on device boot, for her to tell me the events I have that day, along with some context-sensitive chatter;

""Good morning Mr. chrispy212. Looks like a busy one today, you have three appointments. The first is at 9.00am, and is with Dr. Smith. The second is at 12.00 with Dr. Jones, and the last is with Dr. Thompson at 4.00pm.""

However, this was immediately an issue. Correct me if I'm wrong, but integrating Tasker with calendars is a nightmare. Yes, you can HTTP GET your calendar feed from Google, but it's far from ideal, especially considering there are some pretty powerful Calendar API's on Android. 

I want to change that. Tasker's plugin architecture is powerful enough for me to create a plugin that lets the average user query all the calendars on their device - not just GCal but Exchange and others too - and return the results in variables for them to do whatever with.

First off, I would love to find out I'm wrong, this is already possible, and for someone to tell me how, with as few expletives as possible.

Failing that, I'm already in the process of writing it myself. I've got a pretty good grasp of the content provider android exposes for calendar querying.

This is where you guys come in. This is my first, big, general release app for Android. I've done mobile programming before, iOS and Android, but nothing that ever made it to market, and was usually just as a favour to a friend. So, I need your help Reddit! I want you to tell me what you'd want to see in a project like this. I'm fine with the technical stuff for the most part, what I struggle with is generalising the app beyond the uses I have for it.

It will say if you are moving 5 mph or greater (this can be adjusted to any level), you are considered driving. If you are considered driving, the sms messages will be read out loud. I did not use any car docks or application. This utilizes GPS locating signals, so you wont need anything but tasker and a GPS capable phone. Lets start this out!!

Step 1: Create a profile. When you add a profile, click on event, phone, and received text. For type, you can choose any (thats what I choose) or change it to SMS/MMS. Aside from that, leave everything else blank

Step 2: Create a new task from the new profile. Name it text alert. 

Step 3: Add a new action. Click on Audio. Click on media volume. Change the  level to a volume thats loud enough to hear for when your in your car (your phone will raise the volume to this level when its going to say the new text message). Click on the sound checkbox and exit the task

Step 4: Create a second new action. Click task, click goto. Keep the type as ""Action Number"". Keep the Number to 1 (which will be changed later). Click on the ""If"" checkbox. On the left side type ""%GPS"" , on the middle button click on  ""matches"" and on the right side type ""on"". Once you are done, exit the second action. We will go back later and change the number ""1"" to ""4"", but since we don't have a 4th action, it won't allow us to do it yet. 

Step 5: create a third action. Click on Miscellaneous. Click GPS. Under Set, click ""On"" and exit the action.

Step 6: Create a 4th action. Click on Miscellaneous. Click on Get Location. Make sure the source is on GPS and the timeout is 100 seconds. Click on ""Continue task immediately"" (under my observation, it moves much quicker with it checked) After that, exit out of the 4th action.

Step 7: Go back to step 4 and change the action number type to 4 (as explained before). After that, exit the action

Step 8: create a 5th action. Click task. Click perform task. In the name section type ""Convert_LOCSPD_MPH"" (type this with exact caps and underscores. The only thing that isn't supposed to be typed are the quotation marks). Set the priority to 5. Exit the 5th action. Exit out of text alert.

Step 9: You should be on the profiles section now. Create a second task within your ""Recieved Text any *,*"" profile. name the task ""Convert_LOCSPD_MPH"". Add a new action. click on Variables and click on Variable Set. In the name section, type ""%LOCSPDMPH"". in the To section, type ""%LOCSPD*2.23693629"". Click the check box on ""Do maths"" and exit the action. Exit out of ""Convert_LOCSPD_MPH"" to get back to the profile screen. (Its almost complete, I promise)

Step 10: Click back into your ""text alert"" task to create one last action (action #6). Click on Miscellaneous. Click on Say. in the text section type:

 ""%SMSRN sent the following message: %SMSRB"" 

(use the exact caps lock and percent sign). in the engine: voice section, click on the magnifying glass (to find options). Click on Google Text-to-speech engine. Choose your choice (mine was eng-usa). Change stream to ""media"". Change pitch and speed to 5 (doesn't hurt if you change it, but the voice sounds better at these levels). Click on the check box for ""Continue task immediately"". Click on the check box saying ""IF"". On the left side type ""%LOCSPDMPH"". in the middle, click on ""Maths: Greater than"". On the right side, type in ""5"". Exit the task.

 If you want to allow it also to send a message back to the contact saying that ""I am busy driving right now and will message back later"", the next step will explain how to do that (it only consists of one extra step). It is explained at the end what each action each action does if you want to read at the bottom. 

Step 11: to auto send a message back to who sent you the message, create action #7 in the ""text alert"" tasks. Click on phone and click ""Send SMS"". In the number section, type ""%SMSRF"". in the message sentence I typed this

 ""(auto) I am currently driving (at %LOCSPDMPH MPH). Will respond to you when I can safely."" 

the ""%LOCSPDMPH MPH"" will show the contact how fast you are driving.

click on the check box for messaging app. Click on the checkbox for ""If"". On the left side type ""%LOCSPDMPH"" in the middle, click ""maths, greater than"" and on the right side type ""5"". after that, close the action and you are finished. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How it works!!!:


Step 1-3 are pretty obvious how they work. Step 4 explains that if the GPS is already on, it will skip Action #3 and will move onto Action #4. If the GPS is not activated, it will go to action #3 (which will turn on the GPS). Step 6 allows the GPS to track the location where you are at. Step 8 actually starts tracking the current location. Step 9 converts the information that was tracked and changed it into how fast you are driving (MPH). On step 10, the phone learns to speak the new message. The ""If"" section is where you can change what considers an individual as driving. In that section it says that if your moving faster than 5mph, then you are driving. this can be changed however much you want. Step 11 explained how the message can be sent out to the contacts who sent you the message. on the bottom, the ""If"" statement is the same as step 10 and can be changed to any speed you want.

I was asking for a method to automate daily life with tasker. ( http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/16ouso/home_automation_with_tasker/ )

And guess what: I found it, and it's awesome.

I've decided to use tellstick. http://telldus.com/

**Advantages:** 

- Really cheap

- works with a lot of different hardware from a lot of different manufacturers

- allows 3rd party apps

- those 3rd party apps have tasker plugins

- you can control everything with your phone or pc (native clients for linux, pc and mac)

- system can be easily retrofitted into every home

- Very easy to setup


**Disadvantages:**

- Haven't found any yet.

I use this app to control it: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.remotestick&amp;hl=en (Yes, it's got a tasker plugin).

The tellstick net (most expensive, the one I bought because it works without a pc) costs about 90€ and simple wallplugs (on/off) start at about 5-6€. I have now automated my complete home for only about 200€.

I come home - scan a nfc tag, tasker turns my wifi on, bluetooth off, etc. and boots my pc. If it's between 4pm and 7am the lights turn on as well.

I leave the house - all the lights turn off, my pc turns off.

I'm sure there is a lot more stuff to discover here but since I've only had the system for 2 days I didn't really have much time to figure it out. I'm already very excited about it and thought I'd let you know. http://www.pocketables.com/2013/01/living-with-the-tellstick-net-three-months-in.html This guy here has also already written quite a bit about tasker + tellstick.

Unfortunately it only works in europe (has something to do with frequencies).

If you guys have any questions, let me know. :)

Plays UT99 MultiKill sounds with text messages.,stevethegeek,22,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1672c3/tasker_app_interest_plays_ut99_multikill_sounds/,"I've been working on a little app to play through the Multikill sounds from Unreal Tournament. It works very well as a tasker project, but I can't get it to work correctly when I export it using App Factory. If anyone is interested I will post the XML of the project.

Basically it works like this: 

* SMS #1: Headshot
* SMS #2: DoubleKill
* SMS #3: MultiKill
* SMS #4: UltraKill
* SMS #5: MegaKill
* SMS #6: MonsterKill
* SMS #7 - Timeout: Repeats Monster Kill

You can set the timeout length yourself (0-180 seconds) It allows you to adjust the volume or use the systems media volume levels. It also allows you to exclude certain numbers and choose another sound file to play for them (this part was tricky and may not work 100%)

Since tasker can't mute the notification sounds before your phone plays it on a text, it works best if you set your notifications to silent for your SMS app.

Anyway, if anyone is interested I'll post it. I also built a ""Free"" version that doesn't give you the exclusion list or some of the other options. That one does work as an APK, and I can post it as well.

Oh, one other note. Currently, it pulls the mp3 files for the sounds down from an EC2 instance I setup and dumps them to your Notifications folder so it knows where to find them.

This is my first real profile I've implemented all by myself on Tasker. The goal is to automatically set the phone to silent at night at home. However, it should only go to silent if I'm not using it. To implement this, I set up a 'timer' that checks if the phone has been off for 5 minutes, after which it switches to Silent. Once the user uses the phone again (or it's morning come), the phone goes back to whatever setting it had before.

Here's how I did it:
(Also let me know if it can be improved)

1 - Create the first profile (call it e.g. ""Silent at night"") with the following:

* Context 1: From 23:00 till 07:00 (or whatever your sleep time is)
* Context 2: Wi-Fi connected to home network (if you'd like this to take effect only at home)
* Context 3: Variable Value %ISIDLE, Maths: Equals, 1
* Task: Call it e.g. ""Silent"", with the following actions:
    * Silent Mode On

2 - Create the second profile (call it e.g. ""Monitor idle"") with the following:

* Context: Display Off (in the Event section)
* Task: Call it e.g. ""Set Idle"" with the following actions:
    * Variable Set %ISWAITING to 1
    * Wait 5 mins (or however long you'd like the 'timeout' to be)
    * Variable Set %ISIDLE to 1 If %ISWAITING = 1
    * Variable Clear %ISWAITING

3 - Create the third profile (call it e.g. ""Clear waiting and idle"") with the following:

* Context: Display On (in the Event section)
* Task: Call it e.g. ""Clear Waiting &amp; Idle"" with the following actions:
    * Variable Clear %ISWAITING
    * Variable Clear %ISIDLE

Now, very important. In the ""Set Idle"" task, open the Task Properties, and set Collision Handling to ""Abort Existing Task"". This will allow Tasker to count a new set of 5 minutes if you turn on the screen during the previous 5 minutes.

Cheers!

GMD Gesture Control is EXTREMELY flexible and versatile, and you can run tasker scripts with it. Give it a try! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goodmooddroid.gesturecontroldemo

Earlier tonight I rememberd that Nova could do homescreen gesture recognition and at the same time I was using my phone to listen to music and wasn't having fun opening poweramp just to skip the track forward. Enter tasker!

By setting up the tasks to skip back, skip forward, and toggle play pause and configuring the gesture rotate counterclockwise, rotate clockwise, and double tap, respectively, I can now control poweramp from the homescreen. here are the tasks:

    Media Next (96)
    	A1: Media Control [ Cmd:Next Simulate Media Button:On ] 
    
    Media Previous (108)
    	A1: Media Control [ Cmd:Previous Simulate Media Button:On ] 
    
    Media Pause (104)
    	A1: Media Control [ Cmd:Toggle Pause Simulate Media Button:On ] 

That's three tasks, but they're all simple to setup. Open nova settings, go to gestures, pick the gesture you want to use and tap it, then go to shortcuts, scroll all the way down and select task cut (it has the tasker icon) and make a new task with the media action you so desire. Done!

The next section is a bit more advanced and contains one task and two profiles.  It also isn't fully tested yet as I came up with it shortly after the above tasks. What it does is allow you to setup a nova gesture to turn the screen off, which is handy and easy enough to do, but it then enables a mode whereby you can turn the screen back on just by waving your hand over the screen. The screen will stay on for ten seconds, then turn itself back off. You can continue to wave your hand over the phone until you manually turn the screen off with the power button. This is handy when your phone is doing stuff but it's just sitting on your desk and you don't want to leave the screen on. I set the pinch in gesture to turn the screen off because it's kind of intuitive :)

Note that under the tasker settings you will have to enable the proximity sensor to be polled when the screen is off. This under the 'Monitor' tab in settings.

Instructions:

1. Import the task into Tasker.

2. Create two additional tasks:

    A. Make the first one perform the imported task with the parameter ""Day"" (this sets it to normal color temp) and turn the screen on and off.

    B. Make the second one perform the imported task with the parameter ""Night"" (this sets it to the Hot color temp) and turn the screen on and off.

3. Run the tasks, or set them as part of a profile to automatically change them with time as.

What this does: This modifies the system file /sys/class/lcd/panel_colors, which is as far as I could tell is the same action that the preference in the settings screen does (Settings|Advanced|Screen|Screen color temperature).

1373319036.0,16,self.tasker,1hw38i,Howto: Use Tasker to make your phone's auto-rotation less sensitive,kindall,19,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1hw38i/howto_use_tasker_to_make_your_phones_autorotation/,"**Edited** 7/12/13 to remove requirement that accelerometer be turned on in Tasker prefs; this isn't actually necessary.

It's nice that my phone display can auto-rotate, but a pain that auto-rotation is so dang sensitive. I am often rotating the screen when I don't intend to. I want the auto-rotation to be more strict: don't change to landscape unless I am holding the phone nearly exactly in that orientation. Then KEEP IT THERE until I go back to nearly exactly portrait orientation.

Tasker to the rescue... believe it or not!

**Method A** (the best way)

Requires:

* Tasker (of course)
* A ROM that lets you choose what orientations your phone's display can auto-rotate into. I use Carbon, where this is under Settings &gt; Display &gt; Rotation. In other ROMs it may be in a different place. If you have a stock ROM you may or may not have such a feature at all.

Steps:

1. Go into your phone's orientation settings and TURN OFF everything but 90 degrees. Don't worry, the phone will still display in portrait mode; you just have to turn automatic rotation off! In fact, that's how this trick works: we'll use Tasker to turn auto-rotate on and off as a way to force the phone to be in either portrait or landscape.
2. At the bottom of Tasker &gt; Preferences &gt; Monitor, make sure Orientation State Accuracy is set to High. BTW, if you don't see these settings, make sure Beginner Mode (in the UI tab of the Tasker prefs) is not set.
3. Now create a profile: Name: Landscape; Contexts: [State: Display On; State: Orientation Left Side]. Create a new Enter task containing one action: Display Rotation On.
4. Create a second profile: Name: Portrait; Contexts: [State: Display On; State: Orientation Standing Up]. Create a new Enter task containing one action: Display Rotation Off.
5. Set the Restore Settings checkbox in both of these profiles to Off. (Long-press the profile name, then click the settings icon in the toolbar at the top of the screen.) Otherwise Tasker will switch the setting back as soon as the phone is no longer in the exact position needed to activate the profile, which will defeat the purpose.
6. Optionally, add a profile that turns Display Rotation Off at startup, and perhaps another one that turns Display Rotation Off when the display is turned off, if you want to force portrait mode at either of these occasions.

Now your phone won't auto-rotate into landscape until you hold it pretty much exactly in landscape orientation, and won't rotate back until you hold it pretty much exactly in portrait orientation. You can control the required accuracy using the Orientation State Accuracy setting in Tasker, mentioned in step 2.

If you want to, you can add a third profile for rotating to the other landscape mode, and activate 270 degrees in your ROM's display rotation preferences. While the phone will freely rotate the display between these orientations when auto-rotation is on, it should be difficult to switch accidentally since they are physically so far apart.

**Method B**

If you're not running a ROM that lets you disable some screen orientations for whatever reason (e.g. don't want to root) then you can use Tasker with one of the following apps from the Play Store.

* [Rotation Locker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devasque.rotationlocker&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5kZXZhc3F1ZS5yb3RhdGlvbmxvY2tlciJd) - free
* [Ultimate Rotation Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.fameit.rotate&amp;feature=search_result) - $2.99 with 7-day trial

Ultimate Rotation Control has more orientations than Rotation Locker (it supports reverse portrait and reverse landscape). Both have Tasker plug-ins so you can easily set up profiles to rotate the screen, and root is not required for either of them.

The downside of these is that they *force* rotation. Even if an app is set not to rotate (e.g. some launchers have a preference for this), it will be rotated anyway. You can get around this in Tasker by including an app context (with Invert activated) on the rotation profiles to allow rotation only in certain apps... and then adding another profile with just the apps to force them to rotate back to portrait when they come to the front. This gets to be a pain, though.

The profiles you'll need for a basic implementation are the same as above, you just call the appropriate Plug-In action instead of turning the rotation setting on or off.

**Power Usage**

The orientation sensor is basically passive (powered by gravity) and Tasker's use of it uses no more power than the OS's use of it for automatic display rotation. I certainly haven't noticed any additional power consumption since adding these profiles to my Tasker setup.

After searching everywhere, I found there's no easy way of looking at coming appointments; the only way seems to be using HTTP GET on Google Calendar to get an XML list of events.

According to the [Google Calendar Reference](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/v2/reference), in order to get, for example, tomorrow's appointments, the URL is:


https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/yourname%40gmail.com/private-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/basic?sortorder=ascending&amp;orderby=starttime&amp;start-min=2013-06-14T00:00:00&amp;start-max=2013-06-14T23:59:59


where of course *yourname* and *xxxxxxxxxxxx* depend on your account. (Settings&gt;Calendars&gt;Desired calendar&gt;Private address XML)

I tried that, and it works great, but of course I don't want a fixed date. I already have a Tasker task that gets me the correct numbers for tomorrow's date, as %YEARTOMORROW, %MONTHTOMORROW, %DAYTOMORROW.


The problem is, in the URL right after the DAY there comes a T, so if I try to write ...-%DAYTOMORROWT00:... this of course messes with the variable substitution and the value doesn't get parsed.

I tried appending a T to the variable, and that works ok (I get a variable with ""14T"" as a value), but then again when I type this new variable into the URL there's numbers right next to it, that also mess with the variable name.

I tried using spaces like so

    %DAYTOMORROW T00

    %DAYTOMORROWAPPENDEDT 00

in which case the value gets parsed, but the space breaks the URL.

Any ideas?


**TL;DR: How do I put a variable into an URL (or any string for that matter), without spaces after the variable name?**


edit: grammar

**EDIT: Solved! By /u/dreddit51 . Create the URL in a variable, using spaces, then use Search &amp; Replace to remove them.**

Assume you create a task called ""volume off"" which turns the volume down to 0 for notifications, system, media, etc.

Now you want to utilize ""volume off"" so you create a profile called ""sleepy time"" which runs from 10pm - 7am.

Once you have selected the time frame(10pm-7am), tasker asks you which task to run and it lists all the current tasks including ""volume off"". Your first inclination would be to select ""volume off"", which will then copy all the steps from ""volume off"" into your profile. YOU DONT WANT TO DO THIS.

Instead, select ""NEW TASK"" and DONT GIVE IT A NAME. This gives you an ""anonymous"" nameless task.

Next click in the ""+"" and select ""Task --&gt; Preform Task"". From the list you can now have it run ""volume off"". This is great, because if you add/remove something from ""volume off"", your ""sleepy time"" will see the changes.

You can have it run as many ""Preform Tasks"" as you want. So you could create a ""volumn off"" and a ""disable sync"" and a ""copy pictures to remote server"" etc and have it all called in 1 profile.

Doing it this way allows you to create a lot of common reusable task and you can string them together in different ways for different profiles.

I want to be in control when Backitude updates. I don't want it to update when I'm at home, or when the battery is running low.

You have to set up intents, in order to control Backitude.

Create a new task, and add 3 intents (Misc -&gt; Send Intent):

1. Action: ON_WIDGET_UPDATE_FROM_WIDGET

Happy holidays. I've been working on the recommendations that were [discussed in the feedback thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/m94ux/rtasker_feedback/). The changes include:

* A floating announcement bar
* A tagging system for common types of posts

So far I've managed to work out all the CSS so it works pretty well; the mods of [/r/buildapc](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc) have been very helpful with that.

Currently, the tags consist of:

* [Troubleshoot] Troubleshooting assistance for existing or in-development Tasker profiles.

* [Help] Same as Troubleshooting.

* [Request] If you have an idea that you wish to fulfill with Tasker.

* [How To] Share step by step instructions to fill a requirement with Tasker.

Each tag will add an icon, respectively, to the post title.

Nothing is set in stone yet, and will remain subject to community feedback. Please take a look, and post any suggestions, comments, or other feedback in the comments section of this thread.

I travel a lot between central Washington and Seattle. My phone (EVO 4G) has become the greatest travel tool ever, now that I've been getting pretty deep into what Tasker can do. When I dock my phone in my car in the mornings, tasker asks me (via ""Say"" function) several things about my day (am I taking my daughter to school, if I'm going to the office or Seattle, etc) and I talk back (via ""Get Voice"" function) and tasker configures itself for my day. While I'm driving, I have several apps that I open for useful information (WSDOT pass information, navigation, etc.) but I don't want to look away from the road any more than necessary. Enter my (very hacked) version of Siri.

Task: Assist Action  
{{ This is where you put your stuff. See below. }}

So in CyanogenMod 7, you can assign the Search Hold Button action to call a task in Tasker. This is what the ""Search Hold"" task is for. I'm not sure if this is possible in your flavor of Android, so YMMV. If you can't modify this in your ROM, you can create a shortcut on the dock or on one of your desktops to call the ""Start Assist"" task.  
What all the above code gives you is a way to call apps and functions using a single word. When the ""Get Command"" task is called, and you say something, %VOICECMD will be populated with that word (%VOICE is basically a local variable to the task that Get Voice is called in, which is why I push it into %VOICECMD).  
The ""Assist Action"" task should have a list of the things you want to happen based on what you say. For example, I have:  

---
1: Load App: WSDOT; If: %VOICECMD ~ pass  
2: Load App: Navigation; If: %VOICECMD ~ navigation  
3: Load App: Music Mod; If: %VOICECMD ~ music  
4: Load App: Waze; If: %VOICECMD ~ ways   (had to tweak this one)  

---
Notice that the word is all lowercase as that is what is returned from Get Voice. Now, as I'm driving, I reach up and hold search, and say ""navigation"" and immediately the navigation app is loaded. ~~Multiple word actions are possible by increasing the Maximum Results slider on the Get Voice function.~~ You can use multiple word actions with the setup detailed above. So, for example:  

5: Load App: GasBuddy; If: %VOICECMD ~ find gas    

---
Hope this helps to fuel some imagination in your Tasker profiles. I will be doing more in the future, if anyone finds these helpful.  
Thanks for reading!

For more info on the algorithm itself, and why it's good, click [here](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/). I have set up a Tasker version that can be called from another task to shuffle an array for you.

Here is the task:

    FY Shuffle (7)
    A1: Variable Set [ Name:%array To:%par(1) Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
    A2: Variable Split [ Name:%array Splitter:, Delete Base:Off ] 
    A3: Variable Set [ Name:%index To:%array(#) Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
    A4: Variable Randomize [ Name:%rand Min:1 Max:%index ] 
    A5: Variable Set [ Name:%temp To:%array(%index) Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
    A6: Variable Set [ Name:%array(%index) To:%array(%rand) Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
    A7: Variable Set [ Name:%array(%rand) To:%temp Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
    A8: Variable Set [ Name:%index To:%index-1 Do Maths:On Append:Off ] 
    A9: Goto [ Type:Action Number Number:4 Label: ] If [ %index &gt; 1 ]
    A10: Return [ Value:%array() Stop:On ]

Here is an example of another task using it:

    FY Test (46)
    A1: For [ Variable:%count Items:1:50 ] 
    A2: Variable Set [ Name:%test(%count) To:%count Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
    A3: End For 
    A4: Perform Task [ Name:FY Shuffle Stop:Off Priority:8 Parameter 1 (%par1):%test() Parameter 2 (%par2): Return Value Variable:%return ] 
    A5: Wait Until [ MS:0 Seconds:1 Minutes:0 Hours:0 Days:0 ] If [ %return Is Set ]
    A6: Variable Split [ Name:%return Splitter:, Delete Base:Off ] 
    A7: Flash [ Text:%return() Long:Off ] 

So this just creates a new array containing the numbers 1-50 in order, then passes that array (in the format %test(), as you can't actually pass an array to another task, just a single variable) to the FY shuffle task. The shuffle task then splits the now-comma-separated variable back into an array, shuffles it, and then returns the result, again in the %array() format.

This task, meanwhile, waits until the return variable, %return, is set before continuing, then splits the return variable back into an array once more, and it's done.

I've found this: http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/12754/how-can-i-enable-mobile-data-periodically-with-tasker

But at one point I can't combine the conditions into one profile.
It's that one:

&gt; * **Time: Repeat 15min**
&gt; * **State -&gt; Variable Value %LCD ~ 0**
&gt; * **State -&gt; Variable Value %PSAFE ~ 1**
&gt;
&gt;So it runs all 15min, but only when the display is turned off and &gt;power-safe active. We also need an additional Task:
&gt;
&gt; * Net -&gt; Mobile Data: ON
&gt; * Net -&gt; Auto Sync: ON
&gt; * Tasker -&gt; Wait: 1min
&gt; * Net -&gt; Auto Sync: OFF
&gt; * Net -&gt; Mobile Data: OFF

I'm only able to say every 10 minutes but I can't check the display status. 
That's only possible at the tasks.

&gt;4 Profiles Total:
&gt;Profile 1 - OnBoot - Clears and sets variables for new battery drain/charge stats

&gt;Profile 2 - PluggedIn (AC or USB) - Clears and sets variables for new battery drain/charge stats

&gt;Profile 3 - BattCharging - Calculates %charge/hr, time till 100% charge and %battery increase since start of charging

&gt;Profile 4 - BattDraining - Calculates %drain/hr, time till 0% charge and %battery decrease since start of discharging
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;The first two profiles are designed to clear and reset the battery% and timestart variables when the phone boots up or when the power profile changes. The first one is the OnBoot profile which is a useful profile to have in the first place. You can have your phone start a program or do some other useful task when your phone first starts up.
&gt;
&gt;The second one will activate when the phone is plugged in either via usb or the wall plug. This is also a useful profile for other reasons... for example you can make your timeout longer when the phone is plugged in and make it go back to a shorter timeout when it's unplugged with the exit task.
&gt;
&gt;I would imagine some people already have an OnBoot and a Charging profile, so just add the following tasklist to them to keep from cluttering up your tasks if it's viable, otherwise just create the profiles as they are below.
&gt;
&gt;Profile 1: OnBoot
&gt;Context: Event &gt; System &gt; Device Boot
&gt;Task:
&gt;1. Variable Clear: %BATTSTART
&gt;2. Variable Clear: %TIMESTART
&gt;3. Variable Set: %BATTSTART To %BATT
&gt;4. Variable Set: %TIMESTART To %TIMES
&gt;5. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTDRAIN = Please
&gt;6. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTLEFT = wait...
&gt;7. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %TIMEBATT = (blank)
&gt;
&gt;Profile 2: PluggedIn

&gt;Context: - Choose State &gt; Power &gt; Power &gt; Source: Any
&gt;Task:

&gt;1. Variable Clear: %BATTSTART

&gt;2. Variable Clear: %TIMESTART

&gt;3. Variable Set: %BATTSTART To %BATT

&gt;4. Variable Set: %TIMESTART To %TIMES

&gt;5. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTDRAIN = Please

&gt;6. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTLEFT = wait...

&gt;7. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %TIMEBATT = (blank)
&gt;
&gt;Exit Task:

&gt;1. Variable Clear: %BATTSTART

&gt;2. Variable Clear: %TIMESTART

&gt;3. Variable Set: %BATTSTART To %BATT

&gt;4. Variable Set: %TIMESTART To %TIMES

&gt;5. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTDRAIN = Please

&gt;6. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %BATTLEFT = wait...

&gt;7. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %TIMEBATT = (blank)
&gt;
&gt;The next two profiles are where all the math is done. One profile is setup for when the phone is plugged in and charging. The other is setup for when the phone is unplugged and discharging. An IF statement was implemented because Tasker seems to track battery changes very frequently even when the actual battery percent hasn't changed. So a variable called %BATTPREV was created to do a quick check... If the battery % hasn't changed then it doesn't do anything until it does change. Also... I personally have the results written to a battlog.txt file because I found it handy to see a log of data.
&gt;
&gt;I used the Variable Section task to drop one of the decimal points... Precision to 3 decimals is not necessary I don't feel, but there is no way to round it to 1 or 2 decimals yet. I think to the 10ths is plenty for this application.

This was great and all, but I tend to place the phone in my pocket and ended up turning on the screen in my pocket far to often than I liked. I kind of felt liked I had wasted some money.. UNTIL NOW.  

Using [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) I am not able to enable the doubletap to wake my phone ONLY while my phone is docked!!!

**Buy and Install**

* Buy and Install [PGM](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.ponury.pgm2)  ($3.08)
* Buy and Install [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) ($6.49) (or from the [Tasker homepage](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/index.html) for cheaper)

**Setup PGM**

* Run PGM and make sure the **Load and Start at boot are on and checked**, and all the **slide and touch options are unchecked**.

**Setup Tasker to Enable PGM on docking**

* Open Tasker.
* In Tasker's Profiles tab click the ""+"" icon and name your profile something like ""Tap screen to unlock""
* Next select either ""State &gt; Power &gt; Power"" or ""State &gt; Hardware &gt; Docked"" depending if your using a dock or just a USB cable for your dock.
* Hit The Green Check mark to save your condition.
* On the next screen Scroll to the top and choose ""New Task"". Name it ""Enable PGM"" or something more clever and tap the green check mark.
* Click the ""+"" and choose ""Script &gt; Run Shell""
* In the Command field type ""echo enabled 1 &gt; /proc/ponury/g_doubletap2wake"" and check the Use Root option. Then hit the green check mark.
* Tap the green check mark again.

**Setup Tasker to Disable PGM on undocking**

* You should see your profile named  ""Tap screen to unlock"" in the profiles tab. Below it should be your condition and your command ""Enable PGM""
* Long press on the command ""Enable PGM"" and choose ""Add Exit Task""
* Scroll up to the top and choose ""New Task"". Name it something like ""Disable PGM"" and click the green check mark.
* Click the ""+"" and choose ""Script &gt; Run Shell""
* In the Command field type ""echo enabled 0 &gt; /proc/ponury/g_doubletap2wake"" and check the Use Root option. Then hit the green check mark.
* Tap the green check mark again.
* Tap the green check mark again, and you should be setup. Now you can dock your phone and when the screen is off you just double tap the screen and it turns on. Pull your phone out and nothing can turn your phone on but the power button.

I hope someone finds this useful. I am very excited to have this functionality built into my phone. Android for Life! :)

**TL;DR: Want to double tap your screen to turn the screen on while your phone is docked.

I
have notifications for texts turned off in the android options so this
handles them completely. It could easily be added to to include emails

other functions like battery saving, a work mode that tracks clock ins/clock outs, an actual UI, etc. I just got tasker less than a week ago so any feedback/help/better ways of doing things would be appreciated.


Car Mode Project:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/106730378/Car_Mode.prj.xml

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/106730378/Normal_Mode.prj.xml


Sleep Mode Project:
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/106730378/Sleep_Mode.prj.xml


This is what it does:

**Normal Mode:**

* Alarm clock that goes off at 7AM M-F, announces how long I've slept,
and tells me the date and the weather in my city (San Diego).

* Received Texts, uses TTS to announce a text was received and the name of who sent it.

**Sleep Mode Widget:**

* Records the time I pushed it for the sleep timer to announce later

* Turns off my normal text alert

* Sets media volume to 0 (I choose to use media volume for most of my tasker notifications just because it works best for me)

* Turns on my Sleep Text Alert which is silent and sends an automatic
response saying I am asleep and how long I've been sleeping. This
includes instructions that if they send another text including the
word ""emergency"" or ""911"" it will wake me up. It then announces that I have received an emergency text from the sender to wake me up on the ringer channel, which I always leave loud enough to hear.

**Driving Mode Widget:**

* Records the time I started Driving to send drive time later.

* Sets my media volume to Max.

* Announces &amp; starts playing music.

* Turns off regular text mode and puts into Driving Text Received Mode

* Texts received while driving pause my music, TTS says the name of the sender, and then asks if I want it to read the text. If I respond yes/yeah/sure then it reads the text out loud (this only works if the screen is on-for now).


If you want to install this import the projects and change the Task&gt;Sleep Widget/Driving Widget&gt;Set Widget Icons to your own icons, I used downloaded icons (Crystal HD) for the widget icons, so I don't think icon switching will work until you do this, delete the icon changing actions, or download the same icon pack. Then place the Tasker Widget ""Task"" and set the task to ""Sleep Widget"" or ""Driving Widget"" and you should be good to go.


Also, note that the widget labels say the current state, not what you are changing to. So It is labaled as Awake when you are awake, and Asleep when you are asleep, not vice versa.


The weather announce alarm is basically a copy of the "" WEATHER - Speak Weather in the Morning"" profile on the official Tasker Wiki and the toggle widgets are the ""Generic Toggle Widget"" from wiki as well, I just made it so it changes the label and icon. 


**Known Problems so far:**

* I haven't found a good way to get the ""Get Voice"" action to work when the screen is off, even after downloading the ""Secure Settings"" plugin to try to turn the screen on. It works fine with Secure Settings waking up the screen if I(or you) have no screen lock at all, but I don't like that.

* Texts that are supposed to be automatically responded to are sometimes received more than once. I added a 1 second delay to the start of the profile and a 5 second wait before repeating the text received profile, which seemed to fix it, but I haven't had time to narrow down the cause of the problem yet, and would rather not have a 1 second delay if it can be avoided. If you have issues with receiving texts multiple times, try messing with a wait time before repeating or executing the profile.

* Music playback when entering driving mode doesn't always work, I suspect I know the cause of this, but I haven't really had the time to fix it yet

* I am assuming you will run into problems if both widgets are active at the same time(Driving widget set to driving and Sleep widget set to asleep). There is an easy work around by having each profile check the variable the other sets, but they should never be on at the same time if you are on top of your shit so I'm not really motivated to do anything about it. Also I would like to keep the number of variables and checks to a minimum for battery and RAM usage purposes.

This essay is brought to you by a programmer who wants to explain some programming concepts that make Tasker a lot more powerful for non-programmers. It will be long. Let's start, shall we?

**First of all: Tasker condition types.**

Tasker has two condition types: states and events. Events are one-shot... well... events, that happen once and that's all. In a profile you can only have one event condition. If a profile has an event condition, it will be handled as an ""event profile"". An ""event profile"" can have as many actions as you want. Examples: incoming call, screen on, etc...

A state condition, on the other hand, represents a state (actually a set of states, more on that later). It can only have two actions: an enter and an exit action. However, a profile can have a technically infinite amount of state conditions. Examples: location, time, calendar event, etc...

**Conversion between condition types**

Sometimes, you want to use events as enter and exit conditions for states (example: you want to have a screen on/off state). And sometimes you want to launch multiple tasks when you enter a state (or exit from one). Well, you can do that.

**Creating a custom state**

Luckily, ""Variable value"" is a state condition. Therefore, we can create a custom state by modifying a custom variable. How can you do that? Well, a variable must be initialized to be used. In the following example, I'm going to create the ""screen on"" state.

Create a task (say ""InitVar"") that has - currently - one action: set the %DISPLAY variable to 0. Yes, all caps are important - without all caps, the variable will only be accessible in the profile it is set. We want this however to be accessible from other profiles too. This action is under Variable / Variable Set. Check ""Do Maths"", or it will set the variable as a string instead of a number! Whenever you create a new variable, add such a similar action to the ""InitVar"". Press the play button in the bottom right corner to initialize this variable now - you don't want to reboot your phone for this to work, do you? Now create a profile that has a single condition: ""Device Boot"". Its action should be the InitVar task.

Next, the profiles to set the variable.

First, create the tasks. Create a task called ""DisplayOn"". This task - surprise - will run when the display is turned on and will set the %DISPLAY variable to 1. Well, I basically told what needs to be done: the sole action should be Variable / Variable Set, the value to 1 and check ""Do Maths"" for the same reason as in InitVar.

Can you guess what ""DisplayOff"" will do? Yup, set %DISPLAY to 0. Basically, you have to use the same actions as in DisplayOn, only the value should be 0.

From now on, you have a variable that is 1 when the screen is on and 0 when it's off. So if you want to, say, build a talking clock that says the time only when the screen is off, you can add a new state condition: Variable / Variable value. The comparison should be ""Math: equals"", the parameter should be 1.

**Creating a custom event**

States already have two events: a ""phone entered state"" event and a ""phone exited state"" event. You can only assign one task to each. This is the problem here, right? Nope.

Because you can launch tasks from other tasks.

Yes, you don't have to use three auxiliary profiles like above; simply create a task that launches the other tasks (Task / Perform Task).

**One way to make a logical OR: locks.**

Now you can make a new state. That's great. However, you now want to do a logical OR. For example, you are a student and you have two calendars called ""Seminars"" and ""Lectures"". Your university can't plan your classes well, so there is some overlap between them. You have set up two profiles that silence the phone when you have events in these calendars. However, thanks to the overlap the ""unsilence"" runs when the seminar ended and you are already sitting in the lecture. You want a profile that silences the phone when you have an event in either the ""Seminars"" OR the ""Lectures"" calendar.

Tasker, however, only implements logical AND as a relationship between conditions. But - you think - it *should* be implementable in Tasker. You are damn right. There are two ways to make a logical OR. The easier way is to create a custom state. This has a lot in common with multi-level locks from computer science, so that's what I'll call them.

First, you set up this state the same way as you did with the %DISPLAY: you add another action to the InitVar profile that sets %SILENTLOCK to 0. However, it should be a little different: you won't only have 1 and 0, you'll have 0 and greater-than-0 values. The point is: every time your phone enters a state in which it should be silent, it adds one to the variable and every time it exits from a state like that, it subtracts one. When the variable is 0, the phone isn't in any of the states. When it's greater than 0, it's in one of those states, so it will be silent.

How?

Well, you'll need four tasks besides the InitVar: ""SilentLockIncrement"", ""SilentLockDecrement"", ""Silence"" and ""Unsilence"".

Silence will - surprise - turn silent mode on. Unsilence will turn it off. These are the simple tasks. Making tasks like this is the first thing everyone does with Tasker, so I won't detail this one.

Now the increment and the decrement. SilentLockIncrement should add one to %SILENTLOCK so you'll have to use Variable / Variable Add.

SilentLockDecrement should subtract one from %SILENTLOCK, so it should use Variable / Variable Subtract.

Then you should make a profile that actually changes the setting depending on the value of the lock. The condition should be Variable / Variable value. The variable should be %SILENTLOCK, the comparison should be ""Math: Greater Than"" and the value should be 0. The enter task will run when the variable's value changes from 0 to 1, the exit task will run when the value changes from 1 to 0. If the variable changes from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 128 to 127, etc..., it won't do anything since it's still greater than 0. So the enter task should be Silence and the exit task Unsilence.

Now if you want to add any other silence condition (location, time, etc...), instead of silencing the phone directly, you should use SilentLockIncrease and SilentLockDecrease.

**The other way: De Morgan's laws.**

Okay, but you don't want to use any more variables. Can't it be solved?

Yup, it can. Using some formal logic, you can actually build a logical OR without another variable.

Wait, what are De Morgan's laws - you might ask.

[De Morgan's laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws) are:

""The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations."" and

""The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.""

WTF?

OK, in other - mathematical - terms:

NOT (A AND B) = (NOT A) OR (NOT B) and

NOT (A OR B) = (NOT A) AND (NOT B).

So how does it help in creating a logical OR? You see, the second law helps us tremendously. In Tasker most state variables can be inverted, either by changing some parameter (such as the comparison in ""Variable Value"") or simply by checking ""invert"".

But we want to have an OR, not a NOT OR. These are still states, so simply by swapping the exit and the enter actions you can convert an OR to a NOT OR.

Woah, that's dense. Yes, so let's see the aforementioned example with the lectures and the seminars.

Instead of creating the new variable, you delete the original profiles and create a new one. This profile should have two conditions: App / Calendar Entry, with the calendar being Google:Lectures and the Invert checked and App / Calendar Entry, with Google:Seminars and the Invert also checked. You will enter this state when you have neither lectures, nor seminars. So ""Unsilence"" should be the enter condition instead of the exit condition and ""Silence"" should be the exit condition! Brilliant, isn't it?

Good luck with the profiles!

**Philosophical musings about the nature of Tasker states**

I've said that a state is actually a set of states. What did I mean with that? Well, actually a state of the phone would be a set of the values of *all* variables, sensor readouts, etc... of the phone - the battery state, the volume, the reception, the variables you set, etc...

A Tasker state is actually a set of states that match the condition you set. For example, if you set a state based only the battery state, it will ignore every other variable. You can see now how it's a set of states instead of a single state.

That last bit is whenever someone sends me a text that is two or more texts long.  In those situations, it sends on per text received.  That makes sense, but I'm not sure how to tweak it to change that.  During certain events/timeperiods, I set appropriate variables so that I only need to have one task for it.  They'll be notated below.  Here is what I have set up currently:

----

**Profile:** When any text from anyone is received, run ""Texter""

**Texter:**

* Secure Settings(used to turn screen on when receiving a text)
* Variable Set: %Sender to %SMSRF(sets my own variable to the sender.  Used my own to reduce the overall number of tasks I needed to make)
* Perform Task: AutoReply

**AutoReply:**

* Variable Set: %Message to ""[Automated]...""  **IF** %Endo/%CalEvent/%Night is set(Three nearly identical steps that only change what %Message is set to, truncating them out.)
* Stop **IF** %Message is not set.
* Send SMS to %Sender body is %Message  **IF** %Sender is set
* Send SMS to %Caller body is %Message **IF** %Caller is set(I have another task for missed calls).
* Variable Clear: %Caller, %Sender, %Message

----

So that works most the time except for the longer texts that end up with my [Automated] messages sending multiple times.  I'm trying to come up with an elegant way to resolve that issue with as few tasks as possible.

My idea on that is to set another variable at the end of the AutoReply task and make it equal to %Sender(before it's cleared out).  From there I could check in the beginning of the task if %Sender = %SenderPrevious and stop if it does that.  I would then have another profile that waits for %SenderPrevious to be set, waits like 20 seconds, and then clears it.

Is there a better approach than that?",,False,self,t5_2s0ro,False,,,True,t3_1k9z6g,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1k9z6g/troubleshoot_autoreply_tasks_send_multiple/,

I've seen it get a bit of hate amongst Tasker users, but I like it because it's integrated at the operating system level, allowing access from both the [Power Menu](http://i.imgur.com/ncMrHzt.png?1) and the [Quick Menu](http://i.imgur.com/nwzCPVZ.png?1), as well as through the regular System Settings. 

There are a couple of plugins that allow Tasker to change these profiles. I bought [Profile 4 Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.martinutils.profiletasker) ages ago and have never had a problem with it, and there's [CyanogenMod Profiles Shortcut](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mufri.cmprofiles&amp;hl=en) that i haven't used but looks to do the same thing (although with a far better name and icon IMO). They allow changing a CM profile to be used as both a trigger for a task and the end result of a task. This means that Tasker can change CM Profiles based on any criteria, and also act upon any CM Profile change. 

So this is how i combine Tasker and CyanogenMod Profiles, using my work profile as an example:

* When my location is [*Work*](http://i.imgur.com/ouyZOPg.png) 
* I have my [*%LOK* \(location\) variable set to *WRK*](http://i.imgur.com/Y10KP6r.png)
* and run the task [*Profile Set* which changes to the appropriate CM Profile.](http://i.imgur.com/XgPJyBZ.png) 
* When a CM profile is changed to [*Work*](http://i.imgur.com/jHQ3h5e.png)
* I then perform other Tasker actions, like [setting icons, display timeout etc.](http://i.imgur.com/Jr0dtdW.png)
* The CM Profile handles things like [wifi/gps/volumes/lockscreen/etc](http://i.imgur.com/6yfsZia.png) 
* When i leave work, the exit task sets [*%LOK* to *OUT* and again runs *Profile Set* to set the CM Profile to Default](http://i.imgur.com/ffY3xJa.png)

 (unless i'm driving, in which case *LOK* had already been set to *CAR* when i connected to my car's bluetooth)

This setup allows Tasker to change the CM profiles according to the set criteria, but because Tasker only changes it when *Profile Set* is run, you can override it with the Power or Quick menu. Any additional Tasker settings will still be run regardless of whether the CM Profile is changed by Tasker or manually. 

This is the result of a fair bit of trial and error for me, and im really happy with how it works. I'm open to criticisms/suggestions!

Thank you in advance for any help.

1. Is there a way to put my phone on vibrate when it is in my pocket? I was thinking we can use the light and proximity sensor to do this. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

2. I also followed a [guide](http://tasker.wikidot.com/yanawa) to make my phone turn on wifi when I am home using cell towers. But it doesn't work very well. Any other suggestions?

3. Also I would like to use tasker to scan my calendar for certain entries and put my phone on airplane mode. I know I can do it so it scans a particular calendar and silence my phone. That would be easy but I would rather have it so when it sees a particular keyword (for example school or meeting) then it would trigger it. How would I do that?

**4. Lastly, and this is the most important one,** I would like my phone to connect to roaming when I don't have my service provider's signal. I am presently with [Wind Mobile](http://www.windmobile.ca) in Canada and they use the AWS spectrum which means I usually get no signal inside buildings. So every time I am inside a building with no signal, I usually have to go to  *Settings&gt;More&gt;Mobile networks&gt;Network operators* and wait for it to search then choose Wind Away signal.

1350751187.0,14,self.tasker,11swoq,[How to] use tasker to swap between launchers automatically [root] [xpost from r/androidthemes],laharah,17,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/11swoq/how_to_use_tasker_to_swap_between_launchers/,"I posted this 'how to' to android themes a while back and my friend said that you guys might like it. The original post is [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/androidthemes/comments/zwzgm/my_home_screen_while_im_driving/c68fv95) let me know if I can help answer any questions!

This will detail how to do launcher swaps with Tasker. This is not for the faint of heart because you **can** softbrick your device and leave yourself without access to a launcher. But don't worry you would have to screw up pretty royally to do it, and a quick fix with adb and you'll be back in action. This writeup is long and detailed to help prevent that from happening, and so everyone can understand the theory. but the concept and execution is not actually that complex, and once it's setup it'll be pretty seemless

**REQUIREMENTS** you will need:

* [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en) (and you must be atlest a little familiar with it.)
* [Secure Settings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin&amp;hl=en)
* A second launcher of your choice (I used [ssLauncher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ss.launcher&amp;hl=en))
* You must be rooted

**Setting up Secure Settings**
Secure Settings is a plugin for Tasker that gives you control over a whole bunch of phone settings. Once you've installed it open its icon. Slide over to the options page and under ""root actions"" make sure that Package Manager is enabled.

**Getting Ready For Launcher Swaping**
As I said, this method uses 2 launchers. One for your everyday use, and one for your driving mode (or whatever other use you may want a different home screen for). For pretty obvious security reasons, Android will not allow any third party to change your default launcher setting. It will always ask the user which launcher you want to use until the user specifies which launcher gets the default ""chip"". However, if the phone has only one available launcher to choose from, Android will automatically use that launcher regardless of weather or not that launcher has been specified as the default, without a prompt.
To exploit this, we will first have to set our ""driving mode"" launcher to our default launcher. 

* go to system settings &gt; apps
* find the launcher you're currently using (for me this is nova launcher)
* open it and scroll down to the ""Clear defaults"" button and press it
* Press your home button, select your **alternate** launcher (sslauncher for me) and check the ""always"" button. This will give your alternate launcher the ""default chip.""

**Disableing stock launchers**
You must make sure that you have exactly 2 launchers available to Android. Since both the launchers I want to use (Nova Launcher, and ssLauncher) are non-stock I actually have 3 launchers total(the third being Trebuchet, the launcher that came with my ROM). This will walk you through using tasker and secure settings to disable the extra launcher. If you are using your stock launcher already, or you already have only 2 launchers installed you can skip this step.

* open Tasker
* in the ""Tasks"" tab, add a new task
* Name it ""Stock Launcher disable"" (dosen't really matter)
* Add an action: Plugin &gt; Secure Settings
* click the edit button next to ""configuration""
* pick ""Package Manager"" under root actions
* click the question mark in the top left and scroll and select your stock launcher (trebuchet, touchwiz, sense whatever your phone came with)
* once selected make sure that the grey toggle in the middle is set to ""disabled""
* press the save button in the bottom left, then the green check in tasker
* press the test/play button on the bottom right hand side. This will disable your stock launcher, and you should be down to 2 launchers. 

**Using Tasker to automate the swap**
This is the easiest part of the whole enterprise. 

* In Tasker, go to the profile you want to use your alternate launcher with (driving mode for most)
* in your entry task add a new action: Plugin &gt; secure settings
* edit the plugin configuration: Edit &gt; Package Manager
* select your alternative launcher (sslauncher in my case)
* Set the grey toggle to ""enable""
* hit save in the bottom left, then hit the checkmarks to commit.
Now for your exit task do the exact same except make sure the toggle is set to disable your launcher rather than enable it. 

And you're done! You can test your entry and exit tasks, and make sure the launcher is swapped correctly without a prompt. I like to add some tasks to enable and disable the alternate launcher so that I can manually turn it on and off for editing purposes. Let me know if you've got other questions.

*quick note* wallpaper is shared between launchers. this can cause problems when you want one launcher to have one bg, and your alternate to have another. luckly for me I used sslauncher which lets you set specific wallpapers to different pages, so it wasn't a problem. But if you can't do that I recomend using [MultiPicture Live Wallpaper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tamanegi.wallpaper.multipicture&amp;hl=en). With this you can set specific wallpapers to different screens and then shift your home screens around to avoid conflicts.

There's a widget that enables/disables ""SMS Reroute"". When it's enabled, any received texts get put on a server (HTTP Post to a PHP page), and every 10 seconds the task checks to see if another PHP page has any replies for it to send.

For example: using AutoVoice to have a conversation with your phone.  If the voice command isn't recognized, say ""what should the response be?"" and then automatically create a task and profile that links the response with the given key word.

EDIT: example conversation:

&gt;* Me: Hello
* Phone: How are you today?
* Me: I'm angry
* Phone: How should I respond to that?
* Me: What are you angry about?
* Phone: Ok, next time I'll say ""What are you angry about?""

Tasker then creates a new profile using AutoVoice, triggering when it registers the phrase ""I'm angry"" (I could do some algorithmics to find keywords, but that's not in the picture right now) and launching a task that says ""What are you angry about?""  So the next time I tell my phone I'm angry, it will ask why.  I didn't have to make the task myself; Tasker did it for me.

I have the LG Tone+ (hbs-730) bluetooth headset (which is amazing!) and it has a built-in vibrate motor to help alert me when a call comes in. It works fine like that, but what I want tasker to do is make it vibrate when I get a notification for specific apps. I understand how to use the on-notification event to trigger the task, but I can't get a task to vibrate my phone AND my headset. 

I've tried using the ""Alert Vibrate"" and pretty much all the other alert tasks, but all it will do is vibrate my phone. Is there anything I could try to get my headset to vibrate as well? I've tried finding a specific activity to run, but there isn't one (that i'm aware of) that can do it. 

Thanks for the input!

EDIT: Is it possible to send a command to the bluetooth headset through running a script?

EDIT 2: It seems like this is not possible without using the manufacturer-specific AT Commands to send the ""RING"" command to the headset (The only one that controls the vibrate motor).

It has Wake On LAN functionality too, so it lets you wake up your computer remotely, do things, and shut it back down.

I've read quite a few posts recently asking about running something on your computer from Tasker or how to shut down your computer from your phone. This app can handle all those things.

I know I'm biased, but the functionality here is awesome. You can create shortcuts to commands. Combine that with Tasker + AutoShortcut, and you can trigger commands on your computer based on phone conditions. A few examples:
* Wake up your computer when you get home
* Turn off your computer when you leave (or after a certain time)
* At 9pm every day, wake up your media server and start XBMC
* Control audio that's streaming from a PC
* Wake up your computer at 6am and have it start playing music
Etc...

Add in AutoVoice, and you can create quite a few scenarios. One of my main uses for this app (+Tasker+AutoShortcut+AutoVoice) is to control audio throughout the house (Tap AutoVoice recognition widget, say ""Play audio in kitchen"" or ""Play audio and sync all receivers"" or ""Skip this song"" or ""Switch to rock songs"", etc).

EDIT: [It has been brought to my attention that the developer of AutoRemote and AutoVoice has another application with similar functionality as this app: AutoRemote. I am not trying to usurp his sales. If you'd like to check out AutoRemote, get it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoremote]

There is a free version available here (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grayson.remoteexecfree). The free version does not include shortcut support.

1359448148.0,11,self.tasker,17hjzp,"4.2 Car Mode Fix - Car Home Ultra, Tasker and Secure Settings Required.",FullyBaked,14,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/17hjzp/42_car_mode_fix_car_home_ultra_tasker_and_secure/,"So this has been bugging me ever since I upgraded my Gnex to 4.2. Car Mode no longer actually does anything with the home button. Instead of replacing it with the car mode app it just goes to whatever default launcher you have. I use Car Home Ultra and it's an awesome app but the broken home button is super annoying. The author released a simple fix but that only works if you use the stock launcher with it. If you use the stock launcher then all you need is Car Home Ultra and the Patch he released as well. Since I use ADW as my main launcher it caused issues. I'm sure there are tons of people out there that are having similar issues so I'll try and give a step by step of how I fixed it.

Prerequisites: Rooted Device, [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en), [Secure Settings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin&amp;hl=en), [Car Home Ultra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=spinninghead.carhome&amp;feature=related_apps), and [4.2 Car Mode Patch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=spinninghead.homepatch#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDIxMiwic3Bpbm5pbmdoZWFkLmhvbWVwYXRjaCJd)(by the same developer as Car Home Ultra).

1. Open up Tasker and create a new Profile. I named mine ""Car Home""
2. Your Context might vary but I have this profile activate when my phone's state is plugged in and it's connected to my car stereos Bluetooth.
3. Create the entry task. I named mine ""Car Home On""
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;(Your default launcher here. Mine was ADW) - Disabled
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;System Launcher - Disabled
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;CarMode Bug Fix Home - Enabled
 * New Action&gt;Display&gt;Car Mode&gt;Set On and Go Home (Car Home Ultra has an option for this but I think Tasker handles it much faster)
 * Press the play button on the bottom of the Task Edit window to test the new task. Exit Car Mode and return to Tasker. If everything worked right save the task.
4. Add an exit task. I named mine ""Car Home Off""
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;CarMode Bug Fix Home - Disabled
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Package State&gt;(Your Launcher here) - Enabled (I chose to leave the system launcher disabled)
 * New Action&gt;Display&gt;Car Mode&gt; Set Off
 * New Action&gt;Plugin&gt;Secure Settings&gt;Launch Activity&gt;(Your Launcher Here)
 * New Action&gt;App&gt;Kill App&gt;CarHome Ultra, Use Root
6. Save the Car Mode Off task and re-open the entry task. 
 * Press play again to start car mode and make sure the home button takes you to Car Home Ultra. 
 * If everything is working use the recent application button to re-open tasker without getting out of car mode or exiting Car Home Ultra.
 * Now press the play button on the exit task to make sure car mode is turned off and that your default launcher is now re-associated with the home button.

If everything worked then you now have a working car mode once again! I had to kind of figure this stuff out through several different posts at [this thread](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?can=2&amp;start=0&amp;num=100&amp;q=&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars&amp;groupby=&amp;sort=&amp;id=39662) and some trial and error.

1351287521.0,13,self.tasker,1258px,[How To] More advanced Location SMS Auto-Reply,cubanjew,18,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1258px/how_to_more_advanced_location_sms_autoreply/,"**What this does:** 

Automatically replies to an SMS containing *""where are you""* with your location + Google Maps link.

There's a similar Tasker profile out there, but this one takes it one step further by returning the name of the establishment you're(if possible) instead of always using the street address.

This can be much more useful in situations like when your bar buddies ask you what bar you're at - the name of the bar is so much more useful than the address (especially in college towns where there's 10+ bars on a street)

Here's an overview of the procedural flow of this profile:

1. Queries Google Places API to get the name of the food/store/gas station/establishment you are at (uses the GPS accuracy as the search radius).
1. If no establishment is found within your GPS accuracy radius, the full address will be be used,  using Google Geocode API.
1. Automatically replies with your location in the following format:

 	*[NAME/ADDRESS]*
 
 	*[Google Maps Shortened Link]*
 
 	*[Location accuracy] [Your speed]*


**Examples:**	

[Screen capture example](http://i.imgur.com/RtSLj.png)

(If Google API was able to identify establishment name):


&gt;Paddy's Irish Pub
&gt;
&gt;http://goo.gl/abCd
&gt;
&gt;(+/- 6m, 1.2 m/s)



(Otherwise):	

&gt;123 Fake Street

&gt;FakeCity, MN, 59990

&gt;http://goo.gl/abCd

&gt;(+/- 6m, 1.2 m/s)


   
         

**Requirements:**

In order to use Google's API for determining the the name of the store/establishment you're at (not address), you have to create an API key with Google APIs (free).

1. Visit [Google API Services] (https://code.google.com/apis/console/#access) and generate an API key.
1. Go to the [Services](https://code.google.com/apis/console/#services) tab and enable access to ""Places API.""

**Installation:**

1. [Download](http://zomgstuff.net/tasker/Location_SMS_Auto_Reply.prf.xml) the profile and &amp; import it into Tasker
1. In the Tasks tab, open up the ""Send Location TXT"" task entry
1. Open up the second task item (""Variable Set"") and edit the ""To"" value to your Google API Key


**Room for Improvement:**

* Restrict auto-reply to phone #'s in your contacts list by comparing ""Text From"" and ""Text From Name"" phone # variables or by creating a whitelist array
* Change the *""send sms message""* to* ""compose sms message""* if you want to confirm whether or not to send your location


**Privacy:** 

Google's URL shortener only accepts JSON encoded POST requests rather than GET requests. I couldn't find any documentation on how to do this with Tasker so I created a script hosted on my website that acts as the middleman to get around this. 
The script does the following:

* Takes your lattitude/longitude as a HTTP GET request from your phone
* Executes a HTTP JSON-encoded POST request to Google API
* Echos the results back to Tasker on your phone

None of your information is stored but if you don't feel comfortable you are free to download and host the [script](http://pastebin.com/SJuY6BuF) yourself.

I'd love to hear any feedback on my first Tasker profile, thanks!


**----------Edit:----------**

My website is no longer up and I've received several PMs asking for the files. Here are the links &amp; instructions for getting this working again:

&gt;1) **Download Profile:** [Location_SMS_Auto_Reply.prf.xml](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=yjgNiBPV)
&gt;
&gt;(make sure to save as **.xml** and not *.txt*)
&gt;
&gt;2) Since I don't have my website up anymore you'll have to find a place to host this [script](http://pastebin.com/SJuY6BuF) (there's tons of free services), which is used for the Google URL Shortener service. The script I hosted was originally named **gmaps.php** (related to #3)

&gt;3) In the profile xml file you downloaded, you're going to have to modify line 69 that has ""*&lt;Str sr=""arg0"" ve=""3""&gt;http://zomgstuff.net/gmaps.php?url=%LOC&lt;/Str&gt;*

&gt;Change the web address to reflect where you're hosting the php file from #2. (**don't** change the  *""?url=%LOC""* part though).

And wonder if I'd wasted $6.49. I contemplated refunding. This thing is huge, and it doesn't exactly hold your hand. I build computers, and I basically understand some programming concepts, but I'm not a programmer. Still, I sucked it up and stuck with it.

**Profile 1: Car tunes**

*The premise of this one is simple. ICS/JB ROMs for my phone set the Media volume at 6 or 7 when you plug a 3.5mm cord in, whether it's line-out or headphones. It's a feature called Safe Headphone Volume, and it cannot be disabled (doing so in Settings &gt; Sound does nothing). I hate cranking the sound up all the way, then down two. Figured Tasker could help, and I was right.*

Condition: Headset Plugged, No Mic

Task 1: Open PlayerPro

Task 2: Set Media Volume ""13"" (out of 15)

*Works just how I like. I get in my car, I plug in my line in jack to my phone, and PlayerPro opens, and my volume is set. I could have Tasker pick my master playlist when I make it, but it's easy enough to choose and sometimes I'm in the mood for something specific.*

**Profile 2: Bluetooth on, connect, when called**

This one's a straight up battery saver. I use a Bluetooh ear piece, and I hate using my phone without it, but Bluetooth eats battery (albeit not much) and I'm not always on the phone.

Condition: Call incoming (any)

Task 1: Bluetooth on

Task 2: Bluetooth to phone audio (connects to earpiece)

End task: Bluetooth off

*This one also works just like I intended. I left Bluetooth off. When my wife called, I just picked up the earpiece, put it in, and pushed the button. When the call was complete, I check the phone -- no Bluetooth icon. Success.*

It's getting annoying when I'm trying to browse the web and I have 1 or less bars of Wi-Fi signal strength, but my phone is still trying to use Wi-Fi to pull data instead of 3G/4G. I know exactly where the signal drops to an unsuitable level and where it goes back up to a suitable level again. I just don't know enough about Tasker to set this up.  My original ideas for this included using GPS, but I don't want to turn on GPS and eat up more battery life.  I also looked at turning off Wi-Fi and turning it on again, but then I wouldn't be able to determine the network strength again if Wi-Fi is off.  So after some thought, maybe it would be better to just disconnect from the specific wireless network instead.

So a rough outline of what I'm trying to do is:

* If connected to [specific network] via Wi-Fi
* If signal is &lt; [specific signal strength]
* Disconnect from wireless network

Then 

* If [specific network] is in range
* If signal strength is &gt; [specific signal strength]

1372478925.0,12,self.tasker,1halfm,[How To] print text and images from your phone on a thermal printer that is connected to your raspberry pi. (long post),PinkyThePig,15,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1halfm/how_to_print_text_and_images_from_your_phone_on_a/,"EDIT: There is an improved way to do the tasker configuration in my newer thread. http://redd.it/1hr6vz

So This is going to be a very long post. Just a heads up.

All of this shows you how to print pretty much any file (text or image) on your thermal printer from your phone.

This will be broken up in to 3 parts. First will be the initial setup, second will be the text files and third will be the image files. There are probably slightly cleaner ways to do some of the raspberry pi stuff as that is not my forte so if you have any suggestions on that I am more than welcome to hearing them. Now on to the main attraction!

Here is a picture album with the referenced pictures for this project as well as some test prints: [http://imgur.com/a/FGHB5](http://imgur.com/a/FGHB5)

First for the parts list:  
Raspberry Pi: 35$  
SD Card for RaspPi: 10$  
[Thermal Printer \(and needed assesories\)](http://www.adafruit.com/products/600): 62$  
[Two Pin headers &amp; Two Jumpers](http://i.imgur.com/VhK2L3Y.jpg): &lt;1$ (pennies / free?)  
Some solder: 2$ if you don't have any  
Soldering iron: 10$ for an el cheapo one

Tasker: 4$  
FolderSync: 3$  
AutoShare: ~1$  
SSH Command for Tasker: 1.50$

Total Cost: ~ 120 (shipping may add to this number)

First you will need a raspberry pi computer as well as a thermal printer. You will want to follow the setup listed in [adafruit's internet of things](http://learn.adafruit.com/pi-thermal-printer) regarding the software install and follow my hook up pictures [here](http://i.imgur.com/YKPpjnd.jpg) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/RnEHack.jpg).

At this point make sure you can print test pictures from their library and dont forget to run calibrate.py and change the corresponding Adafruit_thermal.py heat setting so that your images print correctly.

If everything up to this point is successful you should have a fully functioning printer.

(**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If you are using a different non root user from the default pi user in which it prompts for a password when running commands as sudo then you will need to either add your user to root or do some other workaround so that it will not prompt for the password as that will break the SSH Command functionality in tasker. There are multiple ways to do this ranging from making your user account a root user to making a shell script that auto runs as root.)

Now for the second part:

This section will be going over how to print text files. The way mine is setup is to tie in to other tasks as I don't currently have a reason to directly print text from outside of tasker.

First, you will want to insert this python script inside of the Python-Thermal-Printer folder that the adafruit tutorial should have setup for you. Also make a folder inside of it called Android. Name the python task piprinter.py

    from __future__ import print_function
    from Adafruit_Thermal import *
    printer = Adafruit_Thermal(""/dev/ttyAMAO"", 19200, timeout=5)
    f = open('/insert/your/directory/here/Android/print.txt', 'r')
    printer.print(f.read())
    f.close()
    printer.feed(3)

With the script installed we can now go back to the phone and add in our tasker task. I recommend making a folder somewhere to save your text file in.

    1. Write File &gt; File: tasker pi/print.txt &gt; Text: %Printtxt
    2. Folder Sync &gt; Config: Pi Printer #Explained after
    3. Wait &gt; 10 Seconds
    4. SSH Command &gt; sudo python /insert/your/directory/here/piprinter.py

For Folder Sync in accounts select SFTP and input the credentials for SSHing into your pi. For Folder Pair select /insert/your/directory/here/Android for the remote folder and the folder where you are saving your text file as the local folder. Set sync type: to remote folder. Check instant sync and set overwrite old files always and conflicting modifications to use local file. Then select this folder pair inside your tasker task.

Now to print anything from another task you will want to set what needs printing to %Printtxt and call this task. This completes the text printing tutorial.

Now moving on to the image printing tutorial. One thing to note here is that for your purposes you may not need autoshare. Autoshare is just needed so that you can browse the gallery on your phone and print directly from there. If you have another task that creates an image and you only want to print that same image name over and over you shouldn't need autoshare. On to the tutorial!

First, install this python script in the same place as last time and name it imgpiprinter.py. For this project you will also need to install Python Imaging Library (may already be installed) if it is not installed run this on your pi's terminal: sudo apt-get install python-imaging python-imaging-tk

    from __future__ import print_function
    import PIL
    from Adafruit_Thermal import *
    from PIL import Image
    img = Image.open(""/insert/your/directory/here/Android/androidpicture.png"")
    basewidth = 360
    wpercent = (basewidth/float(img.size[0]))
    hsize = int((float(img.size[1])*float(wpercent)))
    img = img.resize((basewdith,hsize), PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS)
    img = img.convert('1')
    img.save(""/insert/your/directory/here/Android/processedimg.bmp"")
    
    printer = Adafruit_Thermal(""/dev/ttyAMAO"", 19200, timeout=5)
    printer.printImage(Image.open(""/insert/your/directory/here/Android/processedimg.bmp""))
    printer.feed(3)

That completes the script. It saves the final image as a reference so if the printer is acting up you can make sure that you are sending a valid bitmap file. Now for the tasker task.

    Make a profile that is State &gt; Plugin &gt; Sender: com.sec.android.gallery3d
    Task it links to is named Print Image
    1. Load Image &gt; Source %asfile1
    2. Save Image &gt; Tasker Pi Img/androidpicture.png
    3. Folder Sync &gt; Config: Tasker Image
    4. Wait &gt; 10 seconds
    5. SSH Command sudo python /insert/your/directory/here/imgpiprinter.py

For the folder sync on this set up everything the same just swapping out for the picture directories. For the profile you would want to change/add senders for each program you want to print from. I only currently intend to print from my gallery app so that is all that I added. To actually print tap the share icon and then tap autoshare.

With this you can now print all sorts of things from your phone! Let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions or if you see any typos.

1372175424.0,10,self.tasker,1h1kin,[How To] Shake Phone to adjust brightness or turn on the torch,Darklyte,16,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1h1kin/how_to_shake_phone_to_adjust_brightness_or_turn/,"I've never been happy with any devices auto-brightness settings: they usually leave the screen too bright in indoor lighting and too dim outdoors. Thus, I created my own formula to adjust the brightness of my screen. The task checks the light value twice in case you just pulled the phone out of your pocket and it didn't have an accurate reading the first time. Also, in case you change lighting levels, I added a method to shake the phone to adjust the brightness. If it is too dark, also, it will turn on the torch.

Note: [TeslaLED](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.flashlight&amp;hl=en) is required with the current setup.

Task (Autobright):

     Variable Set %loop to 1
     Variable Set %CurrLight to %LIGHT
     Variable Set %MaxLight to %CurrLight (If %CurrLight &gt; %MaxLight)
     Variable Set %Brightness to 255 (If %CurrLight &gt; %MaxLight)
     Variable Set %Brightness to 1+254*(%CurrLight/%MaxLight)^3/5 (Do Math; If %CurrLight &lt; %MaxLight)
     Display Brightness Level %Brightness
     If (%Shakelight Is Set)
        TeslaLED Toggle (If %Brightness &lt; 10)
        TeslaLED Off (If %Brightness &gt; 10)
        Variable Clear %Shakelight
     End If
     %Variable Add %loop 1
     Wait 3 Seconds
     Goto Action Number 1 (If %loop &lt; 2)

With the task created, I made two simple profiles to handle autobrightening.

Profile (Display on):

    Event -&gt; Display On
    Task -&gt; Autobright

Profile (Shakelight):

     Event -&gt; Shake Left-Right (Low Sensitivity, Long Duration)
     Task -&gt; Variable Set %Shakelight to 1
             Perform Task Autobright
             Wait 2 minutes
             TeslaLED Off


For both the shakelight and autobright task I recommend setting collision handling to ""Abort existing task"" so you have more direct control over the light and don't have to wait 3 seconds/2 minutes to be able to use it again.

Often, I use [SoundHound](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melodis.midomiMusicIdentifier.freemium&amp;hl=en) to identify the songs, so I made a profile using [AutoShare](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joaomgcd.autoshare&amp;hl=en) and [Dropsync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS50dHhhcHBzLmRyb3BzeW5jIl0.) to add songs shared from SoundHound to a text file on my phone that is then synced to my Dropbox. I use [Rainmeter](http://rainmeter.net/cms/) on my computer to display the text file on my desktop.

This profile can be used to work with any app that is able to share text that you want to keep track of. Also, filtering a share by the sending app (package name) requires an in-app purchase to get the full AutoShare app. If you only want to filter by text, then this isn't necessary.

**Setup Dropsync**

If you haven't already, make a folder with the file(s) that you want to be synced. Even if you want to sync just one file, Dropsync only lets you sync folders. Once you open the app, it should take you through the setup of choosing the folder to sync. You can change sync settings depending on your preference.

**Tasker profile**

Before starting with Tasker, go to the app you want to share from, and share what you want to AutoShare.

Now, create a new profile with a State &gt; Plugin &gt; AutoShare context. Tap the edit configuration button. Check the event behaviour box. Tap 'Use Last Share.' If you have the full app, the sender package, subject, and text should all populate. With the free version, only the text will populate.

You can change the text filter how you like, and clear the subject filter. Since I bought the full version, I used the Sender package to identify the share so I cleared the text filter also. For this purpose you actually don't need the full version, you could filter by #SoundHound and it should work, but I haven't tested this.

In the task, you can use the %astext variable to access the shared text. If you need to modify it before saving it, you can do it here. SoundHound adds some extra unneeded text aside from the song and artist, so I used a Script &gt; Javascriptlet action to split out the parts I didn't want with the following code:

    var song1 = astext.split('found ');
    var song2 = song1[1].split(' on #SoundHound');
    var newsong = song2[0];

This stores the song name and artist in the variable %newsong. If you are using a different app to share, you will need to adjust it as suitable.

For the task, you should have a File &gt; Write File action with the file location you want to sync. The text should just be the text you want to save, %newsong for my case. Also check Append and add Newline. Add a Plugin &gt; Dropsync task. Use the sync now configuration.

That's it! Now, when I identify a song through SoundHound I can share it to AutoShare, and it automatically uploads the song name and artist to a text file displayed on my desktop. Hopefully I made it clear, and this is useful for some people. AutoShare has a lot of capabilities that I'm just now starting to explore; let me know if/how any of you have used it!

*This sets the volume of the alarm and ringer to high, waits a second (...I thought this might a problem where the alarm goes off before the new ring volume 'sticks') sets off my alarm, and then shows a scene.

The Scene, Stop Alarm

It's just one big button, called Alarm Off. 

Upon tapping it, it sets ringer volume to zero and runs the ""Shut up"" command.

*This, obviously, shuts my phone up. Which is good because otherwise the alarm is supposed to keep going and going till I wake up*

**The Problem:**

It works...sometimes. For some friggan reason sometimes the alarm just doesn't go off. The scene shows, the volumes get set...but no goddamn sound. I'll wake up to a few new texts saying ""Wakey"" but my alarm is silent. The scene will be showing...not a noise outta my phone.

What is going on?

Could there be an issue when I receive multiple texts?

Right now I have it set that when I connect to a certain device through Bluetooth Tasker opens Neutron Music Player.  I am trying to set an End task that turns off bluetooth when I get out of Neutron.

Steps:  Add Exit Task, New Task, under Net select Bluetooth and Set it to Off: IF %Neutron Music Player ~ Off

My concern is if the IF task will accept things like %Neutron Music Player ~ Off      or at least something to that extent because I've tried that exact IF task and a bunch of other various spellings and abbreviations of Neutron and haven't gotten anything to work.

This method could also be used to create shortcuts to convos/hangouts in Google+ and probably other purposes.

**Requirements**:  [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5kaW5nbGlzY2guYW5kcm9pZC50YXNrZXJtIl0.) (or app that can create shortcuts to android intents like [Manual Intent Shortcuts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.cwfk.ig88.intents&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm5ldC5jd2ZrLmlnODguaW50ZW50cyJd)) 

**Basic Steps**:

1.   Create a new action in Tasker.
2.   Add Misc &gt; Send Intent.
3.   Action: *android.intent.action.VIEW*
4.   Cat: *None*
5.   Data: *content://com.google.android.providers.talk/messagesByAcctAndContact/1/username%40gmail.com*  (replace ""username"" with contact!)
6.   Extra: *from:username@gmail.com*  (replace ""username"" with contact!)
7.   Extra: *accountId:1L*
8.   Save!  You can now add this as a direct shortcut w/ Tasker or create a swipe action if you're using Nova (via Tasker shortcut).

**How I figured this out**:

1.   Download [Intent Intercept](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.ashtonbrsc.android.intentintercept&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInVrLmNvLmFzaHRvbmJyc2MuYW5kcm9pZC5pbnRlbnRpbnRlcmNlcHQiXQ..).
2.   Enable it.
3.   Use a contact shortcut to navigate to gTalk.
4.   Select Intent Intercept.

This screen provides all the information you need to replicate an intent.  You can do the exact same steps but fire up a Google+ Hangout instead (or anything that activates via an intent) if you wanted to create a shortcut to that.  Make sure you use Tasker's standards to define any extra types (int, long, etc).

I have used Tasker for the past couple of years, but this is my first time trying something on this scale.

Right now I have a really weird sleeping schedule, meaning that it varies day by day. (I am in my final year of university with 4 simultaneous group projects at any given time.) Sometimes I end up going to sleep at, say, 1, 4, or 8 in the morning, and my first meetings/classes are anywhere between 7:00 and 18:00. As a result, using the regular alarm system is very cumbersome, especially if I end up falling asleep without intending to. I also am starting to miss classes.

I want to set up tasker to do this:

* Figure out what time I slept based on inactivity periods. I usually look at my phone one last time before I sleep, and often when awake, so 30 minutes after the last activity/last accelerometer readings would probably be a good indicator of when I slept (-0,+5 mins or so.)

* Check my schedule. This is my major issue with it. I can get it to see whether I have something on my schedule right now, and the Name, Description, and Location of a current event (as a built-in variable), but I can't figure out how to tell when the next event starts. Any help or suggestions are appreciated.

* Attempt to give me as many 90-minute sleep cycles as possible, plus 10 minutes to allow to fall asleep. If I am asleep on campus (check using gps/network), then a buffer of 15 minutes before an on-campus event is good enough. If I am at home, then give me 30 minutes or so to get out of bed and get to campus with an extra 30 minutes for shower if I slept more than 4.5 hours, or if I did not go home the day before for more than 20 minutes. (3rd all-nighter in a row, for example). I am thinking of accomplishing this with a bunch of variables, but I haven't been able to find a good way to do time calculations/modulo.

* If activity happens during that period (especially looking at the phone), just kill the alarm.

A few questions:

* How can I get the time of the next event?
* How can I do time-based calculations?
* Can I interface directly with the phone alarm (I am on 4.2 Gnex), or would I have to make/download my own alarm profile/find one online? Ideally, it would be similar to the smart alarm thing that Samsung has (going louder and louder with pretty sounds for about 15 minutes, before the actual alarm sounds.)

Thanks for the help. I hope it would be useful to others as well.

My main objectives are the following:

* NFC tag on the mount itself serves as a toggle to turn everything on or off
* Placing the phone in the mount activates the profile, the USB/audio cables are optional (in the event that I am on a shorter leg of the trip and don't want to fully ""set up"" my phone in the dock)
* Screen stays on, locked in landscape mode.
* Launches a dashcam app in the background to keep recording for as long as it remains on the NFC tag
* Launches something like the iBolt software or CarHomeUltra (not sure which is better yet) in the foreground, with Google Play Music and Maps functionality. 
* Any texts received give me either a voice prompt asking if I want the sender and body read aloud, or maybe a toast with big buttons asking the same thing? I'd like this functionality, but not always on without the prompt, what if I get a text from female friends with my Aunt in the car, etc.
* Finally, I would want any calls to go through the audio out cable (and through my car speakers sans bluetooth as a result), and the mic for calls to default to the speaker phone.

1373129694.0,10,self.tasker,1hr6vz,[How To: Update] How to do my thermal printer task from SL4A for improved printing time.,PinkyThePig,13,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1hr6vz/how_to_update_how_to_do_my_thermal_printer_task/,"This is an update to my [Thermal Printer project](http://redd.it/1halfm). I was never happy with the plugins that I used as FolderSync would randomly take longer than 10 seconds and it would do nothing at all if another sync was happening at the same time and SSH Command only let me use a single server which meant I could either print things from home while on wifi or print things from 4g but not both. I had since then tried all sorts of other plugins over the last few days and all of them seemed to have similar problems. At this point I found Better Terminal Emulator Pro which had scp and ssh built in, perfect. I'm not going to go into the frustrations of figuring out these commands and the BTEP website seems to lack any and all documentation but here is the finished project:

**NOTE: This script requires root on your phone to get around a bug that would otherwise happen with the known_hosts file.**

Required Apps:
SL4A: http://code.google.com/p/android-scripting/  

Better Terminal Emulator Pro ($4): http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magicandroidapps.bettertermpro

First you need to generate an RSA/DSS key for your raspberry pi. Do this via BTEP. Can just google ""dropbear making RSA key"" there are a couple of different ways to do it. You also want to copy the public key to your raspberry pi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

From here you will want to make this shell script inside SL4A:

    su -c /data/data/com.magicandroidapps.bettertermpro/bin/scp -i /path/to/rsa/key/rsa_key /path/to/picture/on/phone/androidpicture.png piusername@192.168.1.10:/path/to/picture/on/raspberrypi/androidpicture.png
    su -c /data/data/com.magicandroidapps.bettertermpro/bin/ssh 192.168.1.10 -i /path/to/rsa/key/rsa_key -l piusername sudo python /path/to/your/python/script/imgpiprint.py
    exit

The advantages of using this script over my previous setup is:

1. It is always going to work, don't have to worry about some buggy plugin
2. It is significantly faster. The task now takes 2-4 seconds as compared to the 15-20 previously.
3. You will no longer run into the issue of the sync taking longer than the wait timer and as a result it prints the old image. With both commands in the same script it waits for the first to finish before starting the second.

When you go to add this to your task you will want to select the gear icon instead of black box so that it will not popup on your screen and instead will run in the background.

EDIT: I forgot to also add there is an update to the python script for printing. This is option but it basically makes every picture that prints from the printer print in its largest way (eg. instead of scaling to print an inch high, it will always rotate to take up more space)

put these lines after the image.open line but before the wpercent line:

    if img.size[1] &lt; img.size[0]:
        img2 = img.rotate(270)
    else:
        img2 = img

Then change everything after that that references img to img2. Could probably cut out the else: and reference to img2 but I haven't tested yet.

EDIT2: In case it wasn't obvious this exact script works for the image portion of the printer project, would need minor modifications for the text portion of the project.",,False,self,t5_2s0ro,1373130915.0,,,True,t3_1hr6vz,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1hr6vz/how_to_update_how_to_do_my_thermal_printer_task/,

* Create a task called ""DEBUG""
* Create a variable called ""DEBUG_FLAG"" (we'll use this to toggle debugging)
* In the DEBUG task, we take in a parameter (%par1) and display/log that if the DEBUG_FLAG variable is set. You can display it as a notification/toast or write it to a log file if you have a lot of information.
* Anytime you have some sort of debugging message in your other tasks/profiles, have it just call DEBUG task and pass whatever info you want it to display as the first parameter.
* Optional: create a shortcut on your homescreen that toggles the DEBUG_FLAG variable to turn it on and off whenever you want.

Earlier last year t-mobile merged with the orange network, and whilst each network runs separately they allow roaming between the networks with no added cost.

This is great for allowing better coverage in remote areas, and apparently the phone is meant to switch to the best network, however it never does. Especially at my work,  I seem to find that my phone mostly ends up in the orange network which switches between 2g and 3g (but the signal is rubbish). It takes ages for me to go into the network dialog, have the phone search for all networks then manually change to t-mobile which connects with a strong H+ connection.

In previous phones I have used there has been a switch within the networks section between manual /automatic network selection, android doesn't appear to have this otherwise I would probably just leave it on t-mobile (i know this isn't the right place to rant about Android functionality)

Is it possible for Tasker to change network's based on location? Or parhaps to set up some kind of periodic check to confirm that it is on the best network available?

I need some help with autolocation. - I have geofences working, but I would like autolocation to report my location using the %allatitude and %allongtitude variables.

This is to save my cars location when it disconnects from my car bluetooth. Now I use get location, but I would like to try AutoLocation.

When I use the variable value in a task it returns nothing. 
1. Autolocation on. Various settings like Location precise for 30 secunds, update every 2 seconds etc.
2. Wait 10 sec.
3. Flash %alprovider, %etc etc etc., however returns nothing.

When I create a new profile using auto location location as entry task (no configuration) it becomes active, when autolocation location is activated. The profile then runs a test task to flash the al variables, and now I succeed. 

So now my question is... How do I get the profile that loads only once in the second described profile, to be available in all other profiles? Do I really need to create a looping task that updates yet another variable every, lets say 5 seconds to archive this, as long as the autolocation location profile is active?

So, what i want to do with tasker:

On incoming call: Check if XBMC is playing and store it into a variable.

When unlocked, the wallpaper should switch to my custom wallpaper screen.

I set my wallpaper with Nova Launcher. It sets it correctly using the portrait option.

Unfortunately, when I use some tasker rules, it sets the wallpaper with the typical Android crop, not the portrait crop that nova launcher is using. 

Usually with Tasker, if a rule doesn't apply anymore, it goes back to it's previous state. Unfortunately, it doesn't' seem to work that with display unlocked. You also can't add an ""exit task"" if you use display unlocked event context.

I thought I could be smart somehow and basically set my homescreen wallpaper with Nova, and then use a Tasker rule that when LOCKED, show this wallpaper, when unlocked, go back to the default homescreen wallpaper previously set (which has the correct crop). You can use display off as a context and treat it as a ""fake lock screen"", but that's not accurate. 

I basically wanted a custom wallpaper for the lock screen that is darker so I can read all my Dashclock widgets without having my homescreen wallpaper leaking through (which is pretty design intensive and hard to read over)

I don't like any lock screen replacements, so I am hoping Tasker can do the job, with some combination of rules / variables, etc. not sure if there is another way to do this. Maybe I need to mess around with wallpaper image size to make Tasker crop it differently or something?

This is a pretty simply task. 
So i created a Tasker profile for mon-fri between the hours of 8-5 repeat every 30 minutes. 

I created a task called: Post to Calendar, and created a popup button task which I inserted a picture of a cat (random but I can change it to motivate myself if I get bored of it) and the button will insert the text ""exercise"" into a calendar for that time for 2 minutes. I use a calendar I don't use often so it doesn't get messy with my important stuff. I also set a vibrate option (or you can add sound to remind you)

I have an NFC tag and task set up to turn on the bluetooth and launch an application which I use to connect to the car's bluetooth during the commute.

I have 2 additional profiles set up which do various things when connecting to my home and work wifi SSID, both of which contain turn Bluetooh off tasks.

The problem I have found is that the bluetooth is only turned off for as long as I am connected to either network. As soon as I disconnect from the wifi, Bluetooth will come back on. 

This is quite frustrating as the phone doesn't seem to connect to my cars bluetooth adaptor unless it's fully initialised before I turn Bluetooth on, I really need to trigger this by using the NFC tag.

So if anyone could advise me on how to ensure when the task turns Bluetooth off and keeps it off I'd appriciate it.

How I have it set up currently is:
I have two profiles set up, one to get into my ""Car mode"" when I plug in my 1/8"" in jack into my phone (I don't have a legit dock for my phone). And the other to actually play the SMS read back using Ivona.

The reason why I put in the part where it pauses the music in the first place is because it wouldn't play the SMS reader. Idk if that's the best way to go about it.

1. Titled Headphones

 Headset plugged no mic

Task:

1. Load App -&gt; App -&gt; Play Music     [To bring my music application up]
2. Media volume -&gt; Level 15            [Bring the Volume up]
3. Flash -&gt; Text -&gt; Media Volume On [To show that it's actually doing it]
4. Profile Status -&gt; Name - *Read Sms* - Set On [Activate SMS reading profile] 

Exit Task:

1. Media Volume Level 0
2. Flash -&gt; Text -&gt; Media Volume Off
3. Go Home
4. Profile Status -&gt; Name - *Read Sms* - Set off

Now for the actual voice part

2. Titled Read Sms

Received Text -&gt; Type SMS

Task: Titled Tts

1. Media Control -&gt; Cmd -&gt; Pause -&gt; Simulate Media Button On [Pause current media]
2. Say -&gt; text -&gt; New Message: %SMSRN sent: %SMSRB. End of message.
Engine: voice -&gt; com.ivona.tts:eng-GBR
Stream -&gt; Media
3. Media Control -&gt; Cmd -&gt; Toggle Pause -&gt; Simulate Media Button On

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/1jejfk/is_there_an_app_that_will_completely_erase_all/) is the post there that got me thinking of this. Basically, the OP wants to be able to wipe the user info on internal and sd card if a predetermined code is entered into the lockscreen. I'm aware [there's an app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vesperaNovus.app.Autowipe) that can do this, but I'd like to do it with Tasker.

I'm by no means a pro with Tasker, but here's what I'm thinking:

Display a fullscreen scene on Screen On event that serves as a lockscreen, displaying a text box for a code to be entered to ""unlock,"" or allow access to the phone. Upon entering the correct code the scene would be destroyed and the homescreen would be displayed. However, If a predetermined code was entered into the text box, Tasker would delete directories containing user info (SMS, call logs, contacts, accounts, photos, installed apps, etc), resetting the phone to factory settings, or at least clearing ALL identifying info.

Here are the issues I'm running into, in no particular order:

1. I'm having difficulty making Tasker display the scene nicely in fullscreen. Borders appear on the left and right sides of the scene grid, as if it's *almost* fullscreen, but not quite. When calling the scene, Tasker gives various display options (Overlay, fullscreen, full window, no title, etc), but I'm not sure which to chose to mimic a lockscreen, and I can't use ""overlay"" because it doesn't work with interactive elements (the text box).

2. I'm not understanding which variable(s) to use between the text box input (the code entered) and the ""Enter"" or ""OK"" button to actually use the code that's entered (hope that makes sense). For example, ""Textbox1"" is where the code would be entered. After entering, the user would click ""Button1"" to enter that code. *If* the code were *1234*, the scene would be destroyed and the homescreen displayed. *If* the code were *4321*, the user info wipe would initiate. *If* the code were anything else, an ""Incorrect code"" popup or something similar would display. What I'm not understanding is how to program the ""Button1"" to check the specific input of ""Textbox1"" when clicked. Like, *When 'Button1' click, If 'Textbox1.text'=""1234"" Then* perform some task.

3. Finally, I'll need to determine which directories to delete to wipe info, but I'll need to get the previous issues sorted first.

I have also integrated it into my morning wakeup.  After my alarm goes off, I get the weather report.  I want to expand this to include news.

I'm wondering if there is a way to do the same thing, use http-get, and pull news headlines from somewhere.  I would like at least 3 top headlines, and 3 local headlines.  I'm not a real good programmer, and would be setting this up in tasker (not programming in C+ or anything on my desktop).  From the looks of it, I just need to figure out where to split my variables, after I dig thru all the code.

When I first thought of this, I wanted the top headlines from a few sources.  I was looking at pulling from CNN, AP, Google, BBC, Telegraph, NPR, STL Today, r/news-hot, r/worldnews-hot.  But just looking at all those different sites code, gave me a headache, so I decided just to start small and try one source first.
I’m going to start with Google News and try to pull a few top and local headlines.  I’m not sure which of those other sources would be easier / nicer to pull from.  My guess is that it will be easier to pull more things from Google than to try to pull from all those sources on my own. 

If anyone has any tips on http-get or variable splitting from the pull that would be much appreciated.

I'm trying to create a music player widget with Minimalistic Text and Tasker, but I've run into a bit of a snag. The %MTRACK variable, which holds title of the currently playing song, doesn't update when the song changes. According to the userguide, the way the variable works is:

* set %MTRACK on music play
* clear %MTRACK on music pause

However, I want it to update every single time the track changes, but I have literally no idea how to do this.


Another issue I've run into is more of an OCD type of thing than anything else. I have it currently set so that when the play/pause button is pushed, it detects if %MTRACK is set after one second, and if not, then that means Play Music isn't running, and that it should start it. Ideally, I would have it start in the background, but I don't know how to do this. I have it set for now to launch Play Music, then to return home half a second later. It works, but it flashes the app screen for a split second, which is not very appealing.


If anyone has any ideas, I'll greatly appreciate them!


**EDIT:** Figured it out!

Changed the profile to:

1. If %Music != %MTRACK
2. If %MTRACK is set (Prevents widget from updating to just ""%MTRACK"")

then task:

1. Variable Set %Music to %MTRACK
2. Minimalistic Text: Configuration - %music=%Music


Essentially, it checks for when %Music is no longer the same as %MTRACK, then updates %Music to the new %MTRACK.

Now, I need to figure out how to get Artist information into %MTRACK. Is that possible with Google Music?

So after a fair bit of googling, I come across the variables %SMSRN, SMSRF, SMSRB and so on [Link](http://tasker.dinglisch.net/userguide/en/variables.html)

Well, it would say ""percent S M S R N"" instead of the sender's name. Not exactly what I was going for. What worked for me was to create a profile that would execute whenever a new text was received:

..........

Received Text - Type,Any - Sender, C:ANY - Conten, optional

Task:

Variable Set - Name, %Smsrn1 - To,%SMSRN

This profile above will store the name of the text message sender to a variable called %Smsrn1. For some reason directly calling the embedded variable wasn't working.

........

Now we need to create a profile that will speak the name of the sender. I also have an alert tone that I wanted to play before the sender's name was announced. This also serves the purpose of giving the above profile time to execute before the following profile will announce the sender

I am fairly noob to Android as I purchased this phone last Friday.  I have installed Secure Settings as well as the helper.

I have a profile set up to disable the keyguard when I am at home or at work based on whether or not I am connected to or near certain WiFi SSIDs.  This seems to execute properly.  However, I've found that sometimes I have to reboot the phone for the profile to work properly.

I've added a Flash notification thats says, ""Lock Removed"" whenever it executes the task.  I see this notification happen after I unlock my phone, so I know the task executed (though I don't know that it executed properly).  

So here is the scenario that I've encountered:  
1.  Go home  
2.  Nearby cell tower causes Tasker to turn on WiFi  
3.  WiFi connects to home SSID  
4.  Open phone and enter my scribbly lockpattern  
5.  I see the flash message, ""Lock removed""  
6.  Put the phone to sleep  
7.  Wait 10 seconds (lock time is 5 seconds)  
8.  Press home key  
9.  I am now looking at my home screen without having to enter my lockpattern, as expected

If I leave my house, the lock screen comes back as desired.

10. Get excited because I got a new notification  
11. Open my notification screen (the thing I pull down from the top)
12. Click on an email notification or, ""app update found"" notification, or an Active Task 
13.  IMMEDIATELY I am brought to the lock screen and have to enter my pattern
14.  After entering my pattern, I am then brought to the screen I was trying to get to

From this point on, I always have to enter my lock pattern to get into the phone until I power cycle.  Every time I unlock the phone, I get my flash notification that the lock has been removed.

Also, this doesn't happen if I manually go into the app update area... it only seems to happen if I click on something from the notification screen.

**Edit:** I don't know what has changed, but after several reboots yesterday evening I no longer seem to be having this issue.  I did not make any system changes or Tasker changes, at least not to my knowledge.

You can play with the 4 second wait, I added that because tasker doesn't recognize Locket as unlocking the display, so I used Display On with a 4 second wait to give time to unlock it.

I'm working on another section to add to the task, that displays the minutes remaining until you can start earning money again if you've used up your 3 per hour, but testing is taking a while, having to wait an hour after every 3 tries...

**Update:** Here's the task to get time left. As mentioned by /u/Hannachomp, the timer doesn't restart after the $.03 limit, but it does seem to be based on the time the app was installed. The first portion of the task finds that time in the app databases, then the rest is simply for updating the time. The task runs once, waits one minute, then runs again. This is because it is used with a time context, and the minimum repeat time is 2 minutes. After the first run, where it finds the time, it runs fast enough that it updates virtually instantly every minute.

2. Set Media Volume = 0 //the media control functions are wonky/inconsistent w/ Pandora and Google Play, so this avoids using them at all
3. Set System Volume = 7 //it should already be at 7, but no harm in double checking
4. Say ""%SMSRN says %SMSRB"" using System Stream //reads back the text
5. Set Media Volume = 12 //sets media volume back to what it should have been

If I just run the task absent the BT Connected-based profile, it reads back the text slightly louder than the music had been playing through the phone's speaker. This is what it should always do, b/c System Volume max is 7 and Media Volume max is 15.

Unfortunately, when I'm connected via BT, the text reads back rather quietly, as if it were reading at a 7 on a 15 scale (maybe even a little lower). This happens using any of the streams with a 7 max scale (ringer, notification, alarm, ~~call~~). *However*, actual Notifications and other System events play loudly, like you would expect with them set to max volume.

The easiest fix here is for me to set the media/voice volume to 7 and just turn up my head unit, *but where's the fun in that?* Having media set at 12 allows me to keep the head unit at a reasonable volume if I switch it over to FM or CD. If Pause/Pause Toggle/Play worked consistently, it wouldn't be an issue, but they don't, so I'm stuck.

I tried manually setting %VOLS to 12, but was told I can't modify built-in variables. I know Android lowers the volume of media temporarily, I think regardless of which stream is used, but it doesn't wait until ""Say"" is done speaking, so any SMS with more than a few words gets played over.

Any ideas on how I can get ""Say"" to read back louder, given the constraint of not using the Media stream?

**Cliffs: ""Say"" function using System stream reads back at 7/7 volume without BT connected, but 7/15 (or lower) with BT connected, any ideas on fixes?**

It is basically a location context that sets some settings whenever I enter said location.  
Features:
* Turns off Location checks once connected to a Wifi
* Automatically turns on the right Wifi Connected profile.
* Easy to add a new location (Basically you just have to close a Location and a Connected profile, rename it to the new name.)
* Saves the current location name to a variable for use in other places (Minimalistic Text?)
* Takes into account a wifi drop (30 second delay before it goes back to checking for locations)


This uses 2 variables, %LOCATIONS holds the names of all your locations (automatically gathered from your profiles when you enter it the first time) %LOCATION holds your current location, it's Unknown when you're at no known location.  
%LOCATIONS might error with your first Location (Unless you manually set the variable.)

I can dump project XML if this has any interest, but you might want to try and recreate it from the description.   It can be quite tricky, but creating this has helped my Tasker knowledge quite a bit :)

This would be useful if you were say giving the phone to your niece/son/daughter etc to play games on and didn't want them messing with your banking apps or the play store etc.

This setup requires 1(or more) Profile(s) and 2 or more tasks. Additional tasks and profiles are only needed if you wanted different passwords for each chunk of apps. Say you lock your phone and wanted to seperate into games, internet and private. You could make games always allowed, internet is one passcode and private stuff is another so that you could give them internet access without worrying about access to your private stuff.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is not super secure and also make sure you hide (or lock) tasker so that they cannot simply enter tasker and turn the profile off.

First we start out with a Profile named Locked Applications 1.  
Select application &gt; then select everything you want locked with your passcode.

Make a new task called Passcode 1 that links to the above profile.  
1. Display &gt; Lock &gt; Set your code that will be typed in to access it. e.g. 2345 check allow cancel, full screen and i recommend checking remember till off.

Allow cancel adds a cancel button to the screen making it a bit easier to cancel out of the app back to homescreen. If you don't have full screen checked they can still tap portions of the app around the side of the lockscreen. And remember till off means you only have to type in the password once until the screen turns off whereas without it you have to type the password in every time you switch to the app.

Then make a second task Called NFC Locker  
1. Tasker &gt; Profile Status: set name by clicking mag glass. change Set: to toggle.

Bind this task to your NFC tag via something like NFC Task Launcher.

If you want additional passcodes for different things then add a new profile and task per each one then add the toggle for that profile inside the NFC task.

BONUS ROUND: If you want it to be one entry of passcode totally disables the password then I recommend changing it to the following.

Add to the passcode 1 task 
2. Profile status &gt; Name Locked Applications 1 &gt; Set: Off

This will set the profile off if the passcode if typed correctly. So typing in once will completely unlock it.",,False,self,t5_2s0ro,False,,,True,t3_1ef42j,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1ef42j/how_to_set_up_an_nfc_tag_to_lock_and_unlock/,

edit: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8pjg7duj2zk46j2/HF19Sw1pad

explanation of the method i used.

the context for the quick charge is battery 0-70%, Location Home, Power Any.

The first task is a popup with voice, ""would you like to efficiently charge your phone?"". you have to TAP (no voice recognition sorry) yes, no or shut down.

yes -&gt; i airplane mode is not available for my nexus 4 so i have individually shut off each antenna and autosync etc

no -&gt; popup ""no problem!""

shut down -&gt; self explanatory

ONCE YOU ARE DONE CHARGING. I have set the exit task to ask you if you want to reboot, you choose reboot or not by tapping. the reason i did this is because I find it much easier to reboot the phone and let it realize which profile is best, if you selected no to efficient charge then you are already in the correct profile you want to be in. For the reboot feature I had to pay 1.50$ for secure settings premium version which is a tasker plugin and can be [found here](http://tasker.wikidot.com/plug-ins-and-3rd-party). if you don't want to do this then you can change it to whatever you would like to do.

and voila your phone reboots and assumes its correct state.

---

This profile would be useful for people who just want to squeeze in as much juice as possible in the 10-15 minutes before they head out the door. I have a nexus 4 with god awful battery life and sometimes ill wake up after a night of clubbing getting ready to head to class and realize its only at 5-10%. normally I'd have to go through a few swipes and taps to turn on airplane mode or to turn off my phone which is not inconvenient in the least but obviously we can make that a more efficient and gangsta process.

TL;DR: get phone to ask you if you want to charge efficiently and respond to your commmand

---
My idea goes like so:

1) New Profile -&gt; State -&gt; Power (source: customizable by you) &amp;  Battery (percentage: customizable by you)

2) New Task ""Quick Charge Settings"" -&gt; Misc -&gt; Say ""hey big pimpin', would you like your phone to charge efficiently?""

3) This is where I want tasker to be able to recognize me saying yes or no. I know that having the context of power (AC,USB) and battery percentage (0-30%) is good enough to enable energy saving actions. If the voice activation/recognition thing is not feasible then I'd remove the task where the phone talks.

4) if the voice thing is doable then I'd also add location awareness to the profile settings (Net ON, GPS off, 500m) and set it to home so that if I plug in my phone in a lecture then there wont be a voice coming from the phone.

5) I'd also take it a step further and once it recognizes me saying yes I'd have it ask ""yo jiggaman, would you like to keep your phone on or turn it off?"", for more efficient charging of course. and If I say no, the following actions will occur.

Secondly - cell area profiles in Llama work based on the currently connected cell, rather than all that are near.

Edit:  A better explanation and some details:

I have a calendar event profile in tasker that fires when I currently have a calendar event.  It has only one action
    
    silent mode: on
When the calendar event ends my phone returns to the audio state it was in before before the profile became active.  

Typically this is exactly what I want.  But, occasionally an event gets out early or something.  This is where the problem comes in.  If the phone was in silent mode before the profile became active, it ""returns"" to silent when the profile exits.  However, if in the middle of the calendar event I turn on the ringer tasker will still return the phone to silent mode when the event ends.

So, what I would like to do: find a way to activate the ringer beyond the end of the current calendar event, but not have to worry about the phone re-entering silent mode for my next event.

Basically I have a profile that enables 4g for certain apps, then when I close them it goes back to 2g after 30sec.


The issue is, if I start say Chrome which will trigger the profile, then exit and start RedditNews which also triggers it, after the first 30 seconds it turns 4g off and goes back to 2g.


To fix this I put : 


If %PACTIVE ~ 4G Override


then stop


else


disable 4g


enable 2g


So basically count to 30, but then after that check to see if the profiles running again, if it is I'm expecting it to 'stop' and not turn off 4g but it doesn't it keeps on going regardless.

When I enter my car, here's what I'd like to happen:

2) I want my Nexus 7 (which I plan to keep in the car full-time) to wake up

3) I want my Nexus 7 to make a connection to my Tunelink over bluetooth.

3) I want it to suspend itself (it is wired in and will not automatically lose power, neither will the Tunelink).

Whenever I spend money, I can tap my phone to my wallet, and it executes this task.

What it does: asks for a variable input (the cost of whatever it is that I'm purchasing) and saves it.  It then goes on to create a ledger file (the amount of each transaction and the time/date of each transaction, with daily totals) and a file with today's spending.  the today's spending file is just the daily total, rewritten after each instance, so a minimalistic text widget can be made and displayed on the homescreen or lockscreen (when using WidgetLocker).

The next step is to make it track HOW the money was spent (cash, debit from bank 1, and debit from bank 2). . . which will, in effect, add 5 more files to keep track of.  I will also be setting up a nightly backup using FolderSync of the ledgers. After that. . . move up to transaction receipt tracking: Reminding me when I get home to take pictures of my receipts for upload to DB using FolderSync, as well.  Once I figure out how to export the task, you will find it here.

OH! I almost forgot! I have a profile set up to write the daily total in the ledger at 11:58 PM and clear all the variables for reuse the next day.

e.g. Say I arrive at 8:35, I can see the profile is active, but it wont send the text until 9am. then if it drops the wifi (e.g in a lift) it will text her again at 9:10 when it picks it up again.

I'd like to set a profile called ""Me"" by clicking volume down. The sole purpose of the profile is to simply alert my phone that I'm the one using the phone, then other tasks in other profiles can be triggered from it.

For example:

""Who is using my phone"" profile triggers when my phone is unlocked and the ""Me"" profile is not set, it then takes a picture discreetly through the front camera.

So if I unlock and press volume down, that won't trigger, because hey it's me! And I'll save battery and memory by not snapping a pic of my mug every time I open my phone.

Any ideas on getting me there? It's probably very simple, or the concept needs doing a different way than I'm describing to get where it's going.

I realize that that question might sound a bit confusing, so here's an example (disclaimer: sorry for the formatting; I'm not sure how to write out Tasker apps :P):

Case 1:

&gt;Task 1:

&gt;&gt;end if


Case 2:
&gt;Profile 1:
&gt;&gt;Event: text message received
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;+
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Variable value: %[headphones plugged in] ~ TRUE
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;Task: Task 1
&gt;
&gt;Profile 2:
&gt;&gt;Event: text message received
&gt;&gt;

I like the idea of only having one profile for each event: why have 3 different processes watching for incoming texts (or whatever the profile's trigger is) when you could do the same job with 1?  At the same time, using Case 1 could lead to some massively complicated tasks if you want a trigger to do different things in a bunch of different situations, which might lead to slower execution of the task.  

I don't think having a bunch of IF statements in a task would slow it down, since ARM processors (mobile CPUs) don't lose any sleep over branches in code, but if you were to start using generics (misdirection) in your task (basically threading one operation through a tree of tasks to get it to do different things) it might lead to some slowdown.

Anybody have any thoughts on this?

1372198837.0,7,self.tasker,1h2gce,My Tasker keyguard off when connected to wifi task,trancemsteve,11,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1h2gce/my_tasker_keyguard_off_when_connected_to_wifi_task/,"Good evening all,

I've had Tasker for a number of months now and just cannot stop learning with it.

One of my favourite tasks to be constantly tweaking (and a task that gets a lot of requests for help) is a keyguard off when connected to wifi.

I started out trying to use the variable %PACTIVE which I found tiresome at best as results completely varied seemingly based on weather, time, and how many pieces of toast my niece had had to eat for breakfast that morning.

Lately it's been getting more and more accurate and I've now settled on a solution that I have yet to fail on me.

My thinking behind this is that it is really useful to have tasker decide what it's doing based on your whereabouts. With regards to the keyguard I wanted it to be off when I'm at home or work as well as if I'm in certain locations where I'll be using my phone a lot and where I feel is a safe place to have no keyguard. Sometimes though I'll be connected to a wifi where I definitely want my keyguard and sometimes I will connect to new routers where I want to have the keyguard removed without much hastle.

My thinking was to have global variables for %Home %Work %Safezone and %Inpublic which should all be self explanatory. Since home and work will rarely if ever change I keep those stored in tasker. For the safezones I store these in an oblique (/) separated text file. I match the ssid of the router I'm connected to either through the variables or the text file and based on the results it will either unlock, ask if I want to make the router into a safezone or it will keep the phone locked (if I answered no to the last question).

So without further ado here's the task:

        Turn Off Keyguard Request (13)
        A1: WiFi [ Set:On ] 
        A2: Wait [ MS:0 Seconds:8 Minutes:0 Hours:0 Days:0 ]

        A6: If [ %Ssid ~ %Homerouter ]
        A7: [X] Flash [ Text:Connecting to %Homerouter Long:Off ] 
        A8: Variable Set [ Name:%Home To:1 Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
        A9: Goto [ Type:Action Label Number:39 Label:Last Endif ] 
        A10: Else If [ %Ssid ~ %Workrouter ]
        A11: [X] Flash [ Text:Connecting to %Workrouter Long:Off ] 
        A12: Variable Set [ Name:%Work To:1 Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
        A13: Goto [ Type:Action Label Number:1 Label:Last Endif ] 
        A14: Else If [ %Ssid ~ %saferouters ]
        A15: Flash [ Text:Connecting to Safezone Long:Off ] 
        A16: Variable Set [ Name:%Safezone To:1 Do Maths:Off Append:Off ] 
        A17: Goto [ Type:Action Label Number:1 Label:Last Endif ] 
        A18: Else 
        A19: Show Scene [ Name:Add To Safe Routers Display As:Dialog, Dim Behind Horizontal Position:100 Vertical Position:100 Show Exit Button:Off Continue Task Immediately:On ] 
        A20: Goto [ Type:End of If Number:1 Label:Last Endif ] 
        A21: End If 
        &lt;Last Endif&gt;
        A22: End If 
        A23: Variable Clear [ Name:%saferouters Pattern Matching:Off ]

As a step by step:

When I hit a shortcut on my home screen (I don't actually like the idea of automatically removing the lock as what happens if I'm on my homerouter but my young niece decides she wants to play a game on my phone and just mashes buttons with reckless abandon) my wifi turns on. There's a wait while the wifi connects. 

Tasker loads the list of safe routers from a text file and then launches a task to extract the ssid I'm connected to from %WIFII. SSID is checked first to see whether it's my home or work router, if it is it'll go into the unlock procedure, if not it'll check whether it's one of my safezones, again if it is the unlock will be launched if not I will get a scene popup asking if I want to add that router to the text file (if I did it would launch a task that writes routername/ that way I don't have to go back and keep updating the text file manually).

Lastly for cleanliness sake it'll clean the variable for saferouters.

Hope this helps anyone looking for a solution, if you want to take a look at any of the linked tasks let me know.

* Pull into garage.
* Nexus 7 automatically finds and connects to home wifi.
* Media Syncs.
* Nexus 7 enters a battery saving mode.

My other question is about the power connections inside of the vehicle.

I want the SSD and Nexus 7 to maintain power long enough to finish the sync'ing process before entering a state where they draw as little power as possible.

I've been able to emulate the work of others up until this point but unfortunately no install that I've found has had these requirements.  I'm no electrician but I'm proficient with a soldering iron.

The main part of this task (and the part i can't figure a way around) is naming the ringtones in ascending numerical order (so all the ringtones you want to switch between should be named 1.mp3, 2.mp3, 3.mp3, etc), and must be placed in the default ringtone directory (usually /sdcard/media/audio/ringtones [or whatever]). After this, the actual tasker part is quite simple.

**Event** Phone Ringing (assigned to my car's bluetooth address)

* 

 **Main Task**

 * Variables&gt;Variable Randomize (Name %RTNUM, Min 1, Max [however many you have])

 * Audio&gt;Default Ringtone (Type ringtone [or whatever], Sound %RTNUM)


That's it! Like I said, simple, but fun!

EDIT: if you instead wanted to make the ringtones go in a certain order (like playing a song verse by verse) instead:

**Event** Phone Ringing (assigned to my car's bluetooth address)

* 

 **Main Task**

 * Task&gt;If (%RTNUM &lt; [number of ringtones + 1)
 * Variables&gt;Variable Add (Name %RTNUM, Value 1)
 * Audio&gt;Default Ringtone (Type ringtone [or whatever], Sound %RTNUM)
 * Task&gt;Else
 * Variables&gt;Variable Set (Name %RTNUM, To 0, Do Maths)

1367861883.0,8,self.tasker,1dsy80,[How To] Per request - Use AutoShare to copy raw image link to the clipboard from imgur browsing app,transientBug,11,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1dsy80/how_to_per_request_use_autoshare_to_copy_raw/,"Per request, I was asked how I setup Tasker and AutoShare to work with the imgur app I use to copy the raw image URL to the system clipboard. I personally use this [imgur app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.duiker101.imgurbrowser) because I think it looks and works the best for me, browsing wise. I also have a folder setup with Dropsync that this task saves its CSV in, so the CSV is on all my computers (planning on writing a small script for them to act as a gui to help me browse what I've saved, but that's a project for another day).  
  
When you share from the imgur app, it gives the imgur page link, which is nice however often times I just want the raw image link and skip the imgur page, so I decided to give AutoShare a go and make something to pull in the raw link. While doing this, I figured I’d also keep track of what I shared in the form of a cheap little CSV with the link and title.  
  
**Profile**  
This part is simple, (I have the full version of AutoShare in case that causes some issues), I just setup a new profile with State&gt;Plugin&gt;AutoShare and setup AutoShare to function like an event to only accept shares from the sender package “net.duiker101.imgurbrowser” Which I found out from setting up a general AutoShare profile that would flash the sender package name.  
This profile runs the task described below.  
  
**Task**  
First thing I had to do was remove the http://imgur.com/ part from the shared URL and then do a HTTP Get.  
  
Variable Split  
* Text - %astext  
* Splitter - http://imgur.com/ 
   
HTTP Get  
* Server:Port - http://imgur.com/  
* Path - %astest2  
* Output File - tmp/imgurTask.html  
  
Next I read the file created by HTTP Get into %image, and split it to get the title (wrapped inside the &lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt; HTML blocks) and the raw image URL (wrapped in the first &lt;img src=””&gt; block).  
I did this with variable splits simply because I was too lazy to actually write a script to clean this up, so my task looks a little like:  
  
Read File  
* File - tmp/imgurTask.html  
* To Var - %image  
  
Variable Split  
* Text - %image
* Splitter - &lt;img src=”  
  
Variable Split  
* Text - %image2  
* Splitter - “  
  
Variable Set  
* Name - %imagelink  
* To - %image21  
  
And finally I set the clipboard to the link, and do another set of Variable splits to get the title (again, first split at &lt;title&gt; and the second one at &lt;/title&gt;). I then do a Write File to imgur/imgur.txt with %imagetitle, %imagelink and Append and Add Newline checked as true. My personal task does a little more like flash a “Link copied” and downloads the image for offline viewing too. I also delete the tmp/imgurTask.html file created by the first HTTP Get, just to keep my sd card fairly cleaned up. On a side note, I’m sure there is an easier way to do this all, but this works just fine for me.

I have to work 8 hours a day, but I don't start at the same time every day, or take the same length lunches. So I decided to make a Tasker project to track my punch ins/outs to make my life easier, because our timeclock at work is not very advanced.


**What it does**

* Writes the user's clock in time, lunch clock out time, lunch clock in time, final clock out time, and total hours worked to a text file in a /Timeclock folder on your SD card. This is done by executing the task with the NFC tag. It would be easy to make it activated by a widget or some other context instead if you prefer.

* On the first punch in, changes the %Atwork variable to 1, which activates a profile that changes screen timeout to 1 minute, turns on sync, and turns off wifi. Since these are activated by a ""Work Mode"" profile, it is super easy to modify the setting changes to your needs.

* On the clock in after lunch, it announces via TTS (Say in Tasker) what time I am off work.

* On my final clock out it also audibly says how long my work day was and changes the %Atwork variable back to 0 to reverse the setting changes.

* It counts clock ins/outs based on a counter(%Workcounter) that counts from 0-3 then resets to 0. If you get this out of sync you will have to manually reset the variable. 


**How to get it to work:**

* Download the project and put it on your phone. 

* Import the project into Tasker.

* Program your NFC tag to activate the ""Timeclock"" task in tasker. You can use ""NFC Task Launcher"" or ""Tasker URL Launcher""(if it works on your phone) to do this.  


**Give me the damn profile already!**

* https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/106730378/Work_v2.prj.xml   (v2 updated with a minor fix)


**Known issues:**

* A couple of the groups of actions in the task can take up to 10 seconds to fully process. I'm not sure why it is taking so long, but if you are just testing it out make sure you wait until the task has finished before activating it again.

* This thing is bloated(too... many... variables). Making it do all the things I wanted it to do in the way I wanted it to do them proved to be more complicated than I had originally anticipated-but it works.

* Local variables don't seem to work right. When I started this I made all the variables global so I could easily track what's going on and identify problems. I changed all the variables to local variables by making the first letter lowercase and it didn't function properly. Ex. %Clockintime changed to %clockintime, did this for almost all the variables in the task, then the task didn't work right. For now all the variables are global until I fix this.


**What I plan to improve:**

* Reduce the number of variables and actions to make it less bloated.

* Figure out why it wasn't working with mostly local variables

* Implement a widget/scene to tell you what mode it currently thinks the user is in, so the user doesn't have to go in and look at the %Workcounter variable to know for sure where the task is, or reset the task to where it should be. Although this shouldn't be a problem unless the user fucks up.

wow i think I may have just found a disappointing answer. I took the excerpt below from [this page](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accedo.unlockathome&amp;hl=en).


""KNOWN SYSTEM'S ISSUE ICS ONWARDS (Android 4.0): Pressing any notification in the toolbar will get up the keyguard. I recommend this app just UP TO Gingerbread (Android 2.3). See my site plz""

so is my fight essentially futile? this makes sense as to why it brought up the keygaurd and not the pattern lock.

My goal with this task is to remove the lock screen entirely when im within my home radius. My assumption of what keygaurd does is disable the lock screen entirely so that when I power on it goes straight to the homescreen.

setup

task: disable pattern lock. disable keygaurd (both actions done with secure settings pro)

exit task: enable keygaurd. enable pattern lock (secure settings pro)

the problem is this doesn't work all the time, it sometimes works when i manually execute the task but other times it doesn't work. I'll lock the phone and reopen it to a slide to unlock screen. This leads me to believe the pattern lock disable works but not keygaurd. taskers keygaurd disable is useless and doesn't work even when manually executed, don't know why.

I'm trying to make a task that automates sending a text message to someone when coming in contact with a nfc tag. I use google voice which seems to make this process a tad bit more difficult. Essentially what I have so far is tasker opens gvoice, selects my last conversation ( I only text one person on my gvoice), and then I want it to go straight to the enter text field. If I tried using the d-pad down till that happened it is dependent on the number of texts already existing in the conversation, so that would be unreliable. 


I do know that there is a gvoice plugin but I am cheap and don't want to spend 2$ when I would like to learn more about tasker and do a workaround. 

I messed around with send intent sms but that seemed to skip gvoice and go straight to my regular sms app because that is the default. Also I don't want to do that method because it creates a new conversation in gvoice and I just want to piggyback on the last conversation.

Tasker newbie here so go easy on me please.  I was attempting to create a profile/task to turn off mobile data and apply the wifi sleep policy as long as the device isn't plugged in if the screen is turned off and turn mobile data on and keep wifi on if the screen is turned on.  I used the Profile named Battsav context of time 00:00 to 23:59, named it to run a task consisting of :

1. If %SCREEN ~ OFF

|2. Mobile Data set OFF

|3. WiFi Sleep Policy Never While Plugged

4. Else If %SCREEN ~ ON

|5. Mobile Data Set On

|6. WiFi Sleep Policy Never

I have a second profile for when the phone is plugged in using the Profile Context of Power - Any and a task consisting of:

1. Profile Status Name Battsav Set Off

With an exit task consisting of:

1. Profile Status Name Battsav Set On.

Currently this task does absolutely nothing.  Mobile data and wifi stay in whatever state I set them regardless of screen or charging status.  Here's a [link](http://imgur.com/8MaZNqo) to a screenshot of the screen on/off task if that helps.  Can anyone tell me what I did wrong?


*Edit:  Also, as a troubleshooting step I tried setting Mobile Data off if %SCREEN ~ on and it still didn't turn mobile data off.  So I think it's a greater problem with tasker's ability to actually turn mobile data off on my phone using this variable.  

Prior to this setup I tried a few different setups that had mixed results.  I tried creating a profile called ScreenOff using Display State Off as a trigger to run a task that turned mobile data off and a second profile called ScreenOn with Display State On as a trigger to run a task that turned mobile data on.  In that instance Tasker seemed to get confused and frequently have the wrong profile active when the screen was on, leaving me to have to turn mobile data back on manually, so I tried adding a context to the Screenoff tasks that turned the ScreenOn profile off and vice versa.  The ScreenOn profile would never turn on automatically in that instance so again, I had to turn data on manually.

So I tried adding exit tasks to each profile.  ScreenOn would turn itself off as an exit task as would ScreenOff.  That worked better but tasker still seemed to run the wrong task occasionally.  What eventually led me to trying the method outlined here was when I tried to add a profile related to charging my  phone called Plugged In.  That profile was triggered by Power Any and it turned off both ScreenOn and ScreenOff profiles and ran a new task to keep all data on and an exit task to turn both ScreenOn and ScreenOff back on and turn Plugged In off.  That addition fouled the whole thing up to where Plugged In would never turn off and data would constantly stay on.

I tried all this same stuff with Display On or Off Events as opposed to display on or off states and that did nothing at all.  Just enforced the settings defaults.

Profiles with events and profiles without events behave differently: profiles with events are instantaneous; they trigger new settings or actions and then that's that. On the other hand, profiles based on states have duration; they apply settings for as long as their conditions are valid (e.g. plugged into AC power, Chrome in foreground, etc.), and then restore the previous settings afterwards. For that reason, event profiles can't be assigned exit tasks – there's no end-point for Tasker to detect.  
  
Except when there is. When profiles contain both events and states, they have distinct start and end times, yet they can't be assigned exit tasks. The states become subordinate to the events; they are merely conditions required for the event to trigger the action. I'd like to set it up the other way.  
  
Here's an example: I need to put my phone into silent mode when I go to bed and back into vibrate mode when I wake up. I use a sleep cycle alarm clock (Sleep as Android), which means I have to manually initiate the alarm every time I go to bed (so it can accurately measure my sleep periods). I'd like to set *one* profile based on the following settings:  
  
Contexts  
1) State - Power AC  
2) Event - Initiate sleep tracking (via a Home Screen button)  
  
Enter Task  
1) Silent Mode  
2) Set %SLEEP variable to 1 (linked to call screening)  
3) Send sleep tracking intent to Sleep as Android  
  
Exit Task  
1) Vibrate Mode  
2) Clear %SLEEP variable  
3) Clear %DAILYBACKUP variable (linked to a separate task, but needs to happen every morning)  
  
This way, my volume settings change once when I go to sleep at night and once when I unplug my phone in the morning. This task can't be split into two separate event profiles, since there's no event setting for ""detach from AC"". Using a state profile instead (not plugged into AC), Tasker will run my exit task (including resetting my backup counter) *every time I unplug the phone*, rather than just when I wake up.  
  
I could get *close* to my solution by splitting this into three or four tasks, but still no cigar. I realize this problem could also be solved with NFC tags – you say persnickety, I say minimalistic.

I'm trying to do my own personal voice assistant with Tasker and i'm on a good way. I'm implementing features as: Calling people, HandsFree actions in the car as answering or hanging up a call or saying ""later"" and it hangs up the call and sets an alarm for 1 hour with the label ""Call *callername*"".  
  
But my problem is the reminder function i'm trying to implement.
It kind of goes like this:  
      
-I'm clicking the task icon in my notification bar and google voice search waits for my input*  
-I say: ""Remind""
-Tasker says: ""What?"" 
-I say: ""Pick up my laundry, do the dishes, wrestle a bear and kill Justin Bieber"".
-Tasker says: ""When?""
  
And this is where my problems start. I'd like to say ""Tommorow at 2pm"" but that needs to be converted in minutes.


So i was thinking if someone could provide a way (or write a script and put it on a server, parse the results from the voice query and send them back as a variable in Tasker) for converting ""Tomorrow at 2pm"" or ""Next Wednesday at 3pm"" to XXX minutes so Tasker could use the ""XXX minutes"" as a variable for adding an event in the calendar ... 
I hope you get my point.

I have several profiles, one for work, one for home, one for the Car etc, that enables a specific behaviour on that location.

For some time I have tried to use wifi connected or wifi near to get this right, but then when I go into the garden where I have no wifi reception phone will &gt;&gt;of cause&lt;&lt; revert to previous state. (pin code)

I have tried autolocation but with no great success. 
Boot: Enable autolocation, no power. Enable geofences.
- I have created a circle around each location R=1km to enable ""balanced location"" when I am near my home/work etc. And a smaller circle R=150M to enable specific behaviour at home/work etc.
However this doesn't solve the problem. Sometimes the profiles doesn't trigger at all, and when they are triggered I have a significant delay before it discovers I have exited a location. 

What is your experience with this? - How do you handle location specific issues? Just by wifi or by autolocation? - Something third?

I'd say I probably spent 12-18 hours to connect the printer and diagnose all of the stupid mistakes I made on the way. I can elaborate on the printer setup if anyone is planning on replicating this but I figured I would include my tasker setup as the steps involved can easily be adapted to other uses/applications. 

On a side note does anyone know of a ssh command launcher that can handle multiple server addresses? The one I used on this task can only store a single server address which means I can either do printing from home or printing via cell connectivity (internal vs external IP).

    1. Variable Query %Printtxt
    2. Write file &gt; File tasker pi/print.txt
    3. FolderSync Plugin &gt; Sync tasker pi folder on phone with pi
    4. Wait 3 seconds
    5. SSH Command Plugin &gt; sudo sh startscript.sh

So now for an explanation:

Line 1 is purely for debugging, I've taken it out now that I've finished. It allows me to make sure that a unique file is being synced each time so that I know it is syncing the file

Line 2 Saves %Printtxt inside a folder as a txt file.

Line 3 Is setup to sync via SFTP the text folder on my phone with my raspberry pi

Line 4 is there to give the sync time to finish. On a 10 character file that is more than enough (100 ms or so was actually long enough) but I made it longer in case I need to print large files, this may need adjusting in the future.

Line 5 runs the start script on my raspberry pi which calls my custom python script (composed of 7 lines) that will actually print the file.

So now all I have to do if I ever need to print something is set what I want to print to %Printtxt and call this task and it will print!

Next project:

Print images from my pi/phone. It has a print image function but as far as I know the image has to be a .bmp monochrome color which I would need to find a way to convert the image.

1367819092.0,6,self.tasker,1ds0et,[How To] Explanation on how the APOD wallpaper task from the wiki works broken down.,PinkyThePig,10,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/1ds0et/how_to_explanation_on_how_the_apod_wallpaper_task/,"So I figure this would classify closer to a tutorial for a beginner at tasker to give them a more in depth look at how a task does what it does in a more easy to digest form. I personally glaze over when a long technical explanation is given at once. I have to see how the thing does what it does to actually understand it and be able to use it. So here is a task taken from [the wiki](http://tasker.wikidot.com/apodwallpaper) and broken down into more manageable chunks so you can see what goes on behind the scene.

First, here is the app as displayed in tasker http://imgur.com/hRvLnRh

Here are the instructions with a breakdown of each chunk.

   Create a context at 7:00 to 7:05

This actually triggers the change to happen every morning.

&gt;Make a folder APOD in the root of your SD card

This is required as tasker will not auto create a folder.

&gt;    HTTP Get: server = apod.nasa.gov/apod, Mime Type = text/html

This actually pulls the source code for the website and stores to a universal, default %HTTPD variable in the format of text/html

&gt;    Variable Split: Name=%HTTPD, Splitter=&lt;IMG SRC="", Delete Base=Checked

This takes the %HTTPD variable and every time it encounters &lt;IMG SRC="" it will split the variable into a new offshoot. If you view the source code you will notice that this happens precisely where the background picture occurs. Delete Base will clear any previously set variables (basically making sure we have a blank slate). With the split everything before the IMG SRC becomes %HTTPD1 and everything after becomes %HTTPD2

&gt;    Variable Split: Name=%HTTPD2, Splitter="", Delete Base=Checked

With this step we currently have the picture URL at the beginning of the variable but a ton of junk after it. This step allows us to clean all of that out. %HTTPD21 now contains our 'clean' URL and %HTTPD22 and up contains the rest of the junk for the website.

&gt;    HTTP Get: server = apod.nasa.gov/apod/%HTTPD21, Mime Type = image/jpeg, Output File=APOD/apod.jpg

This step takes our pretty URL which as of writing is image/1305/lemmon_rhemann_960.jpg and appends it to the URL to pull only the picture with the mime type specifying we want a picture format file and the output file is saying what and where we want to save it to.

&gt;    Set Wallpaper:Image=APOD/apod.jpg

This actually sets the wallpaper to the picture we just downloaded.

&gt;    HTTP Get: server = apod.nasa.gov/apod, Mime Type = text/html

This and everything that follows is used to pull the Description in case you are curious or if you want to view it.

&gt;    Variable Split: Name=%HTTPD, Splitter=Explanation:, Delete Base=Checked

This dumps everything out from before the start of the explanation

&gt;    Variable Split: Name=%HTTPD2, Splitter=Tomorrow's, Delete Base=Checked

And dumps everything from the end

&gt;    Write File: File=APOD/apod.htm,Text=&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;%HTTPD21&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

Then writes everything to a file that can be read.

My wife will text me once and the same message will show up anywhere from 1 to 5 times.  This has happened through multiple phones (both mine and hers have been replaced over the years) and different text applications.

I believe that Tasker may be able to provide a solution for this but I'm not sure how to implement it.

I imagine that receipt of an SMS message will kick off a task, and then I need to:

* evaluate the sender and content of the the message.
* Look in the recent SMS history from the sender (say, last 5 messages)
* If there is a content match, discard the message

I'm pretty sure I won't be able to achieve this by simple configuration of Tasker and that I would need to write a script or program of some sort to help with this.  I'm not averse to coding as I have a programming background.

I'm not sure where to get started with this.  What programming APIs or scripting languages would be capable of doing this and how do I use them with Tasker?

Also I'm not sure if I will be able to suppress the notification message for the incoming duplicate text.  Not sure if I can sit in front of my SMS application like a filter.

I am trying to create a new ""Secure My Phone"" profile which will secure my phone by setting it to use my Secure CM profile, which turns on Mobile Data, GPS and WiFi, and requires a PIN to unlock the phone. The context for this profile is receiving a text message with a particular word.

I am having an interesting problem, though. All my Tasker profiles are setup so that the enter task switches to the desired CM profile, and the exit task switches to the default CM profile. Here's what's happening:

1. My phone is on my Home profile, as I'm at home.
2. My phone receives the text with the word that triggers the Secure My Phone profile.
3. The Secure My Phone profile switches my phone to the Secure CM profile.
4. Tasker executes the exit task of my Home profile, which switches my phone to the Default CM profile.
5. No Tasker profile is active, but my phone detects that I'm connected to my Home WiFi (which is the context for my Home profile), and switches to the Home profile.

So to put that in more basic terms, what happens is that my phone receives the message, switches to the Secure CM profile, switches to the Default CM profile (because of the exit task of the previously active profile), then switches back to the Home profile (where it started).

Does anyone have any ideas on how I can fix this? I thought I could possibly use an If statement on the exit task of the Home profile to prevent it from executing if the Secure My Phone profile is active, but I don't think that will work because the Secure My Phone profile has an event as its context, which if I understand correctly, means that it does not remain active, but rather it merely does its enter task and that's it.

My temporary fix was to use a gesture on Apex Launcher to trigger a separate task in Tasker that toggles the status of the autolock (bonus: any way to use the Alert-&gt;Flash to show which state I've toggled to? I'm using the Profile Status command)



Here's what I've got:

Triggers: Proximity Sensor, Call (invert)

Task: System Lock



Super simple right now. But I'd love to have it do something like check the proximity sensor, if it's active, the task will wait two seconds, check again, and then lock if it's still senses proximity.

Problem is that the proximity sensor seems to only exist as an event trigger, so I can't seem put it into a task after a WAIT command.

Goodbye phone.  My new version for my sgs2 has the text initiation but also runs the same task every bootup. (I don't reboot often but this method will work even with a changed sim)  You will need to install the free sl4a, python and secure settings to make this work.   
The task turns on wifi, turns on gps, waits 2 minutes to allow the bootup to finish (i had errors without the wait).  Then the phone plays a notification, waits 20 seconds and takes a photo through the front and back cameras hopefully catching info about the location and the thief.  then it gets the location and sends the photos attached to an email with lots of other variables listed as well that might help track it.  All this is done discreetly but the email comes back to the phone so if the thief looks at the notification there is a message for them as well.

 This is my first post here so if I'm doing it wrong, let me know (there are not a lot of examples of profiles here) Ill post the exported description for now. Obviously the gmail (note it only works with gmail) address and password have to be set.  Hopefully I can help someone else not lose their phone.

I have Tasker on my phone and Tablet, and I love it. I have a case for my tablet that has a BT keyboard, and when I connect it to my phone, I want Tasker to automatically switch the keyboard from Swiftkey to Null Keyboard (a BT keyboard that doesn't pop up).

The reason being, when typing with my BT keyboard and I go to select some text with my finger, Swiftkey pops up, so I have to hit ""back"" to close it. Really frustrating.

Any easy way to do this with Tasker?

**[Solved]** (thanks to czuares, the Secure Settings dev): You need to have Secure Settings installed on your phone. It's a [free app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.intangibleobject.securesettings.plugin&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5pbnRhbmdpYmxlb2JqZWN0LnNlY3VyZXNldHRpbmdzLnBsdWdpbiJd) on the Market/Play Store. Also, in order to install Helper, I needed BusyBox. I don't know if that was just my device, or if it is actually a requirement. Just be aware that I had to install it.

From there, you just create a Plugins-&gt;Secure Settings context in a Tasker profile for changing input method!

What a great app :D

I wrote this profile because my navigation app always makes my phone super hot to the touch while going down the road, so I thought I would drop the CPU down while navigation is running. It also helps the constant discharge problems with even the 1 amp correctly wired car charger I have.
I tested this out and it seems to do the trick, I am going to add notes on each step in parenthesis at the end of the line to walk someone through my reasoning.

	A2: Wait [MS:0 Seconds:0 Minutes:15 Hours:0 Days:0] (I put a wait in so that while I am feeding information in the CPU is responsive and snappy)

	A3: CPU [CPU:0 Governor:ondemand Min. Frequency:245000 Max. Frequency:245000] CPU [ %NAVI ~ 1 ] (sets the CPU down to 245mhz if navigation is still running, noted by variable matching 1 which is set before the wait.)

Exit: Anon (29)

	A1: Variable Set [Name:%NAVI To:0 Do Maths:Off Append:Off] (sets the variable back to 0 when navigation is closed so that it won't turn my CPU down if I just want to look something up on maps real quick, since navigation and maps are tired together I was getting context matches just from using maps.)

	A2: CPU [CPU:0 Governor:ondemand Min. Frequency:245000 Max. Frequency:998400] (sets my CPU back to normal)

Thinking about it and seeing it work made my day.

Create a profile with Event ""Shake left-right"" as context. As action pick media control and select next. Name this profile.

Then, go to your ""headsets plugged-in"" profile (if you don't have one create it) and add the Tasker action to turn on the previous profile and, as exit task, add the action to turn it off.

My question: is there a way to have the notifications do something when you click them? For instance, when you get a text, and click the notification for it, it takes you to messaging. I would like to be able to click the notification and have my volume lower in the morning. Then in the morning, I click that notification and it raises my volume to normal.

Now, I know what you're going to say: ""Why don't you just set it up for the volume to change at the times set?"" Well, because I don't always show up or leave at those set times. Those are just general times, not guaranteed.

I decided to make a plugin for Tasker that triggered when you got a new message, or your karma totals changed.

I have some code that I have to type into terminal emulator to check that it isnt mounted, and create a simlink to the SD Card.

The code is as follows

su
rm -r /sdcard
ln -s /mnt/sdcard /sdcard

(obviously i do ls /sdcard before removing the folder)

I have the Execute Locale plugin, which works fine with tasker, and have made a Task to run the above code.

This works great, but what I want to do (if its possible) is write a profile to check ls /sdcard, make sure there is no response and 
 and if the dir is empty; carry out the task as described. I would like this to be done on (or shortly after) startup.

Does anyone know how i would get tasker to check the output of ls /sdcard before carrying out the task?

Thanks in adv

TLDR: want to check output from execute plugin before performing task.
