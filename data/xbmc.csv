Once a multi-platform browser like Firefox can play it that'll allow Linux users to more easily get this up and running.

But in the future could it not be possible for someone to code a ""browser/portlet"" directly into xbmc. In any case I'm really hoping this helps smooth things out going forward.

What I'm looking for:

* Silent
* Inexpensive (under $150)
* Supports IR remote control (via USB dongle is fine)
* Supports power on/off via remote control (or draws so little power that it doesn't matter)
* Smooth playback of all mainstream codecs (xvid and AVC, really, up to 720p at least, with AC3 and DTS decoding, not just passthrough)
* Smooth menus
* Able to boot directly to XBMC (or OpenElec)

I guess, basically, I want it to feel exactly like my full on media PC, but cheap and silent.

Or should I stop waiting and just build a silent PC?

...

UPDATE: So I just ordered an Ouya from Amazon. Here's my understanding and reasoning: It's got the power to make pretty skins operate smoothly and decode SD (XviD for example) content smoothly also. While there is no official version of XBMC for it with HW acceleration yet, that will be supported in v13 whenever that comes out. I plan to use unofficial versions of v12 w/ HW accel, understanding that it may be unstable. It looks like I can add an IR receiver, although might be tricky. All in all, it looks like a pretty decent horse to hitch my wagon to. And FREE GAMES! THE FUTURE!

UPDATE: well i found out the hard way that the Ouya isn't silent, there's a whiney little laptop fan inside that's actually quite annoying. BUT, many people have reported changing it out with a Noctua fan and getting near-silence from it, so i'm gonna try that now! still NOT regretting my decision. XBMC plays all files and menus smoothly, however it does crash often. i expect those bugs to get squashed over the coming months.",,False,,t5_2qhno,1375654948.0,,,True,t3_1jco5j,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/1jco5j/are_we_there_yet_looking_for_a_small_silent_cheap/,

I posted a while ago when [Maraschino](http://www.maraschinoproject.com/) was in its infancy. It a web-based front-end for your XBMC HTPC, that acts as a dashboard to view and control XBMC, Sickbeard, SABnzdb, and many more.

Recently we have added support for multiple servers, so now you can easily switch to the XBMC installation in the bedroom and control that.

Another small change (that I feel is actually pretty useful) is the ability to choose from a 3, 4, or 5 column layout, which means that you can display a lot more modules on the screen.

We have quite an active dev community. Gugahoi has created a fully-functional module to manage Sickbeard, and NEM3SIS has create an advanced Trakt.tv module.

Other features include a media library browser and advanced playback/seek controls. You can even toggle ""remote"" mode and use your keyboard to control XBMC!

And of course, it shows you what has been recently added to your library, and looks kinda pretty too.

Sorry for the shameless self-promotion, just wanted to tell you guys how far along it has come (if you remember it the first time). Plus I want to grow the userbase... I want it to be the best XBMC-focussed web frontend that there is! Your suggestions would be welcome.

If you've ever tried messing something up with your XBMC installation, this guide should hopefully help you succesfully installing the XBMC Backup addon to help you secure your XBMC's data further.

**Step 1:** Install the addon. It can be found in offical XBMC repository, under Program-Addons!

**Step 2:** Create a dropbox app! Head on over to [dropbox.com/developers/apps](http://dropbox.com/developers/apps), and choose to create a new app. You'll want to make a *Core API* app. Give it a name you can remember, and beware that it cannot have the same name as another app, so maybe you'll have to try a couple of times. Just give it permission to a single folder, and proceed. On the next page, don't go anywhere but take note of the *App key* and *Secret key*. We will need those now!

**Step 3:** Authenticating your app with XBMC Backup. (I'm assuming you're running Confluence or a skin that has the same menu structure)

You'll want to go into the programs folder, and move your cursor over XBMC Backup. Don't enter the addon quite yet though. If using a keyboard, press *C* to bring up the context menu. Using a mouse, simply right click! You'll want to bring up the settings menu for the addon. With a mouse I suppose you'd right-click, but what you want is not the menu with the options *Backup* and *Restore*, but a 4-point menu with one point being *Add-on settings*

In the General tab, change the *Remote Path Type* into Dropbox. Now you'll need to enter your Dropbox Key and Dropbox Secret that we got when creating the app! Choose how many backups you want to keep, let everything else be if you don't feel like messing around, and simply click **OK**

**Step 4** Authentication, part 2: You'll get a popup with a wonderful large button, but don't click it just yet. Instead, you need to either SSH or SFTP into your XBMC if you're running without any peripherals, or else, open up a file explorer. I'm running Linux, (RASPBMC), but the instructions are almost the same. For **RASPBMC or another dedicated XBMC OS**, navigate to:

/home/%USERNAME%/.xbmc/temp/xbmc.log

&amp;nbsp;

For **Windows XP**, navigate to:

%MainDrive%:/Documents and Settings/%Username%/Application Data/XBMC/xbmc.log

&amp;nbsp;

For **Windows Vista, 7&amp;8**, navigate to:

%MainDrive%:/Users/%Username%/AppData/Roaming/XBMC/xbmc.log

**Step 5** Finding your authentication URL: If you're SSH'ing in, use **nano xbmc.log** (or the equivalent for Windows or Mac SHH, though that doesn't happen so often) to check the log file. At the bottom, you'll find a line somewhat like this:

**NOTICE: script.xbmcbackup: Authorize URL: https://www.dropbox.com/somethingsomething/**

Copy this URL into your browser, and allow the addon to use your app. Now click OK at the big red box, and it'll start syncing!

**Step 5.5** Authentication URL for SFTP or Standard file explorer: If you're using SFTP or FTP, download the xbmc.log file to your local computer, and open it here. Again, also for standard file explorers, find the line mentioned above, and copy it into your browser. Allow the addon to use your app, and you're good to go!

And that should be it. Good luck and have fun, and sleep safe knowing that your XBMC data is just that bit more safe now!",,False,,t5_2qhno,1372798198.0,,,True,t3_1hi7yc,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/1hi7yc/how_to_use_the_xbmc_backup_addon_with_dropbox/,

The HTPC from Pulse Eight is good, but its not really great, there is some serious internal heat issues, and unable to confirm is the system is registering the right temprature or not, but the case itself, even though is built to behave as a heatsink gets seriously warm.
It plays all 1080p videos just fine, but sometimes it does crash because of the use of AEON for XBMC. Dont know if i can blame the htpc for that. Overall i do like it, but i would be willing to upgrade to a better system. Maybe the new steambox that are coming out, they could potentially be used as great xbmc htpcs.

* Desktop - Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS running deluge, flexget, couchpotato and PlexMediaServer. I run XBMC on this machine and it connects to the PLexMediaServer - all media is stored on this machine. It is my part-time server at the moment.

* Clients - HTPC(XBMCUbuntu) and Android 4 tablet.
________________________________________________________

I am not a big fan of PlexMediaServer, it does the job but it doesn't seem to integrate too well with XBMC. I've tried [syncing XBMC using mySQL](http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Sync_multiple_libraries) in the past but it didn't work properly for me (which was probably down to the fact that I had no idea what I was doing with mySQL). 

* Is this the best method to have all XBMC settings shared across the network? 
* I believe it should allow me to have stop/resume on different clients, identical setup and layout, i.e., favourites, streams, add-ons, etc. Is this correct?
________________________________________________________

I have just added a server to the network and would like to get the most out of it. The new setup will eventually look like this:


* Server - Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS running flexget, couchpotato, {some torrent client}, {some media server for XBMC/Android clients}.

* Clients - Desktop (Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS with XBMC client), HTPC(XBMCubuntu) and Android.

* Browsing a large music collection when using an external MySQL database is now much much much faster
* Overall database actions are a lot quicker (I'm guessing a lot of the SQL queries were re-written as some of the old ones were atrocious)
* Playback of 1080i/50 content now works fine without having to use a third party build
* Rewinding/fast forwarding/pausing of internet streamed content seems to work a lot better (no major issues found so far, not properly tested whether it recovers from a long pause of streamed content yet)

TYPE 2: Cable-ish.  Lol.  I would hate to say this, but is there a plugin that mimics clicking through channels?  I feel like my parents would be most comfortable with this.

TYPE 3: Series.  I am not sure if I can ask this, but disregard if I can't.  What are some plugins for watching the latest and greatest TV episodes?  Where can I find them?   

TYPE 4:  Chilling music.  I have a legit rdio subscription, but wonder what the best plugin for listening to music is.  The scenario is a few people are over getting fucked up and I want to fire up some music.

For example, the newest season of 30 Rock just will not show up without going into the ""Files"" menu. I'm not sure if this is a scraper issue or a filing issue. On the external drive (where mostly everything works fine) the TV shows are organized into individual folders for each show. On the seeding drive everything is just kind of thrown in there and the only time its split into folders is when it downloaded that way, and even those shows in folders don't show up. On the drive I use for storage everything seams ok, with a few exceptions (like Batman Beyond only showing up as a show title but not showing any of the episodes). I read on the XBMC wiki that missing videos is usually due to a file name problem and I should rename them. First off, there's no way I'm going through and individually renaming 500 GBs of TV shows. Second, the file names are exactly the same on the storage drive (like 30.Rock.S07E01.SomethingaAbouttheUploader.mkv/mp4/whahtever). What am I screwing up here? 

Also, while I'm here, a feature I would love, and I'm sure exists somewhere, is the ability to some how link to the private tracker I use and show new shows and movie uploads so I dont have to close XBMC and open a browser and then add files to uTorrent. If I'm going to do all that I might as well just use uTorrent to open the file. Any nice way of doing this? 

Thanks in advance to anyone that can put up with what I'm sure is becoming an annoying daily question.",,False,,t5_2qhno,False,,,True,t3_1cnxyg,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/1cnxyg/i_know_you_guys_probably_get_sick_of_help_me/,

My question is this, what's the best unit I could buy which would run XBMC to my TV over hdmi? I usually watch movies/shows in 720 or 1080p and would be streaming them over the network (my PC is already set up as an SQL server for my libraries).

- Remote Control
- 5.1 Sound
- Full Linux support (not a must, windows is ok as well)

I only come to that hypothesis because of when the error occurs and the fact that FRODO cannot run over a Remote Desktop session like EDEN could, so clearly they're not entirely the same in that regard.

Right now I just manually delete things if I start running out of space and XBMC's next library scan picks up that it's gone, but it would be nice to automate yet another process.

1. What is your best practice for using XBMC as a music player?

2. Are there any better apps to be using?

I just set up OPENELEC XBMC (latest stable version for ION) on my new ID84 and want to share my experiences with you.

The Hardware: The ID84 has no problem playing 1080p mkv files with full DTS sound without a stutter. It is a nice and small machine which comes with a remote, which works with XBMC out of the box. The systemfan makes a nearly unnoticable sound. It is only barely noticable in silent scenes during a movie.

Getting the dedicated Nvidia grafics to work: Just make sure the VDPAU option in the system playback menu is checked.

The Sound through HDMI: For sound to work through HDMI you need to disable the sound for the onboard soundcard in the BIOS.

If you experience the 24p bug (aka stutter in all playback with all files): There is an option in the video playback settings in XBMC's system options which allows XBMC to adapt the frequency to the TV settings. This will make XBMC play all files in 24p and so the stutter is gone.

Building the library: It can be a lot of work to get your files in if you haven't named your files properly before. If you switch to the file view you can find easily which movies have not been found by scrolling through the list and looking out for movies which don't have a poster yet. These will need manual adjustments to work.
For TV series to be found properly I found the best is to have all files named something like S0XE0X in the filename.

Logitech Harmony: Setting up a Logitech Harmony to work with this setup is no problem. Just choose the ID80 remote setting in the Logitech configuration. It will work.

I've a couple of questions:

1. I downloaded XBMC today and installed 1channel on my mac (just so I could see what it's all about). When I try to search for a film or tv, it takes 2/3 minutes to 'search' for whatever I'm looking for. Am I doing something wrong? Is it supposed to take so long? I've got a super quick internet connection etc.

2. Ideally, I'd like a machine (Apple TV, Raspberry Pi etc) which allows me to run XBMC, can connect to the internet wirelessly, and possibly be able to handle AirPlay (or equivalent). A jailbroken Apple TV is around £200, which is a bit expensive. Question is, is there a machine that can do what I'd like? 

3. How reliable are the addons downloaded (such as 1channel)? I tried 'TV3', as I wanted to show my Latvian partner the Latvian channels, but none of the programmes would play. It said something to do with image rights or error with the log (or something like that). 

Thanks in advance for any help!

In which a lot of my shows had titles formatted in which the scraper would not see them whatsoever.  Along the lines of:

 ""Breaking Bad - Season 1 Episode 1 - Pilot""  

No matter how hard I tried, I could not get a scraper to see it!  I was about to lose my hair.  After renaming one episode correctly, it was picked up by XBMC and Ember.  The program is very simple to use... I can give it commands to find ""Breaking Bad - Season 1 - Episode"" and automatically have it rename every string in that folder to:

""Breaking.Bad.S01E""

Which, as you can guess, saves a ton of time.  From there I could make small modifications in bulk to all file names to get them to match specifically what I wanted.  All in all, it took me about 25 minutes to rename my entire library, and XBMC picked up everything.  It was especially useful for my episodes of Dexter, in which 5 seasons were incorrectly named.

I'm finally buckling down and getting my media organized.  I've been collecting for quite some time but finally got a media server up and running and I've been slowly moving it over.  There seems to be addons for scraping data in XBMC (that I may not be aware of), apps like EmberMediaManager (this even maintained/used anymore?), TheRenamer, and a slew of other sites or applications.  There seems to be an infinite number of ways to download, manage, and organize media now.

I'm curious as to how everyone here does it.  What is the common work flow?  For example are most just letting SAB download, then run post processing scripts to move files, then allowing XBMC to add to library, scrape for data, and add fan art?  Is there some solution that is generally more common?  Any tips or tricks that others would like to share when it comes to managing the 1000s of shows, movies, and even music?  Also, what is a common folder structure that most prefer or use?

I love my XBMC setup, but one thing I miss from Windows Media Center is the way fanart cycled in the background if you have more than one fanart file (e.g. backdrop, backdrop1.jpg, backdrop2.jpg, etc.).

XBMC doesn't seem to support this: when I imported my library it created a &lt;moviename&gt;-fanart.jpg file and it uses that for the background/fanart image. That's fine and all, but is there any way to make it cycle through multiple images without excessive skin hacking?

I've tried simple things like renaming the other fanart images &lt;moviename&gt;-fanart1.jpg and the like, but no joy. It still just uses the default fanart image.

As of now he wants to keep Win7 installed. We did a fresh install of 7 with latest drivers. In the BIOS we disabled onboard audio.

Good god, If I didn't feel like I was working miracles getting this thing to run at full speed....

As of now, we're running the resolution at 1366x768p with vsync and not run through a full screen window. After trying every resolution and video rendering option in xbmc that I could think of, we ended up sticking with DVXA and then DVXA2 checked and turned on.

From there, we have set playback to sync with the display (this seemed to solve a lot of stuttering issues). I've never turned on this feature with any other HTPC I've built, so I found it strange to do so here.

His sound is somewhat weird, and is set to analog because there's no optical output and it runs HDMI to the TV, which then goes to a stereo soundbar via optical.

All the video is streamed from his main computer over Cat5 100Mbps using SMB on Windows 7. I tried convincing him to use Cat5e but he was persistent that it was too much... Whatever.

Anyways, I was wondering if anyone has any ION based tips/tweaks to get this running any better. Maybe a way to set up the nvidia drivers and finally enable 1080p. Maybe I'll just have to force him to use OpenELEC or XBMCbuntu.

Btw, everything we stream is either standard definition or 720p x264 with a dts or dd track.

One simply doesn't turn on, the other gets to the first menu screen but won't react to the controller.
I assume these are common old hardware issues, but these were bought online items from modders, &amp; I don't know much about the process to troubleshoot the problems.  

If it's likely that they are past their prime and only going to be a hassle, what does one do with an unwanted old xbox? They have a couple of small hard drives within them that should be salvageable at least.. Is that easy for me to do?

If there is a way to bring them back to life I'd like to try it.

Is it worth trying to revive xboxes as the hosting hardware, or has everybody moved on these days to other hardware systems for XBMC? 

I loved having the XBMC interface as a huge media center library for films &amp; tv series, ftp-ing nicely organised posters etc. &amp; definitely want to be able to go back to that method rather than just USB-ing everything individually to the ps3 all the time.

Loved having the old emulators too.

I wanted to post here to kick my ideas around with you folks in the know, to shake out any issues prior to getting started introducing him to XBMC.

He has a 32"" older Sony Bravia flat tv, and an HP Mini 110 that he wants to use to drive media to it. The port options between those 2, are the RGB for video and headphone jack/RCA for audio. We shouldn't have any problems with this hardware setup, I don't think. He has an android phone too, and has just installed the XBMC remote app from the Play store .......from a hardware perspective, I think we are good.

Software: The 'lil HP mini shipped with XP, and it is incredibly bogged down with 3 years of abuse and malware. I've got the go ahead from him to install XBMCbuntu on the thing as the primary OS ......... formatting the drive as I go to start fresh with a new os.

He lives out of town a little, and dose not have an always on internet connection. Therefore he does not currently have a local wifi network setup at his place. I'm lead to believe that for the remote app on his phone to work with the XBMC HP mini across the room - he'll need a common local wifi network setup with the android phone and MINI connected to it.

Question -Will a local wifi network suffice for this setup? or will he need an always on internet connection to make this setup work?

Foreshadowing Step 2 - once I get the above setup and working, I am going to fire up a serviceable PC that he has collecting dust, get it (and the mini) connected on his local network, and manage his local media from it. Stay tuned for questions on that front next.

I am using the Eden version of XBMC, has been working quite well for months, got most of my addons set up right etc etc.

However I have noticed a problem recently and I am not sure if it has something to do with resetting cache (is this even possible on the XBMC/HPTC setup? I reboot my computer regularly) - what happens is when I am streaming something from 1channel, it unexpectadly quits as if I had stopped the stream.  And then when you try and get back into it it gets hung up and won't load.  Sometimes you can load up other streams, other times they don't load and you have to exit out and get back into XBMC and then it works.

why does this happen?  Anything I can do to fix it?  I used to run XBMC through a jail broken apple TV2 and I would reset the cache every once in a while - not sure if that applies here.

That's it. 

Wake on startup is working via [Startup Delayer](http://www.r2.com.au/page/products/show/startup-delayer/) and [WOLCMD](http://www.depicus.com/wake-on-lan/wake-on-lan-cmd.aspx), but I rarely shut that computer down. 99% of the time it goes to sleep when we fall asleep at night.

I'm running XBMC in the bedroom and it see's the servers shared folders via smb. XBMC has the WOL add-in, but add-in's don't run until XBMC is fully loaded, I believe. And since the server isn't awake, XBMC can't see the shared folders since they're via SMB, so XBMC never fully loads. [If this is wrong. maybe someone can correct me.]

So, to get around that, i've been trying to make a .bat file run on the XBMC computer's wake to wake the server. So I installed WOLCMD, made a .bat file, then installed Startup Delayer, which runs WOLCMD, then a .bat [WOLCMD *MAC* 192.168.10.154 255.255.255.0], and it works from startup, but not from sleep.

So I looked into [Power Triggers](http://win7suspendresume.codeplex.com/), but I can't figure out how to get it to run Startup Delayer.

Any help or ideas, or a simpler solution?

EDIT: Instead of Power Triggers, I'm now trying Task Scheduler, based on [this post](http://www.sevenforums.com/general-discussion/104953-task-scheduler-run-program-wake.html#post1719428). Not sure why I didn't think of this before.

I managed to get all the files off the old machine and onto an external hdd before it all went south. And 90-95% of these files are usable by the Raspberry pi.

However a few folders... mostly to tv shows... seem not to be.

* It will see the folders, and even pull title card graphics for them
* OpenElec won't see any files within the fodlers

This leads me to believe that these folders probably had a file permission issue as a hold-over from the old media center (likely they were created by the admin account on that machine and thus are ""locked"" to other linux systems).

Has anyone had a similar problem? How can I strip the permissions from these files?

I suppose I could re-encode or transcode them on a windows machine, but I'd be much happier if there was an easier/faster solution.

This seems like a problem that should have a simple solution but I am yet to find it after searching through the forums and this subreddit.

I have my computer hooked up to a computer monitor and my TV, both with DVI cables. I have two audio cables leaving my soundcard. One Optical which goes to my AV Receiver and one analogue that goes to my two computer speakers on my desk.

Using Windows 7, when I want to go from getting the sound on the receiver to the desk speakers or vice-versa, I go to playback devices and set the required one as default. I actually have a little macro running called [Soundswitch](http://soundswitch.codeplex.com/) which does it for me by pressing ctrl+f1 but you can set it to whatever you want. This is irrelevant but some people may be interested because it makes life easier.

My issue is that XBMC seems to override whatever my default output device is and only play out of whatever is set in sytem&gt;settings&gt;audio output&gt;audio output device. Now is there any way to set this just to be the system default so when it changes on the system, it changes on XBMC too? Correct me if I'm wrong, but I never had this problem on Eden or an earlier version of Frodo. I'll be honest I never noticed when it stopped working but I know that it used to change automatically.

Has anyone fixed this problem or found a work around? I would be happy to have it go to both, that way I could just mute the one I wasn't using, but the only patch I have found for that was only for Eden.

It seems like a problem that shouldn't exist or should have a simple solution. If there isn't one, I suppose I will just have to concede to navigating through three menus to change the setting manually. I would think there would be an easier way though.

It is annoying to have to jump back to the beginning just after I start playing a video, so the first few seconds isn't cut off. This is a problem for TV episodes.

Does anybody else have this problem (other than connecting the drive directly to the Pi)? Is there a solution for it? 

The Pi is the only XMBC or XMBC-like (Boxee Box) device I have that is affected by this. I've tried upgrading XBMC to higher versions (12.1, 12.2), but that didn't fix the problem.

Here are my relevant specs:

* System: Raspberry Pi, Model B, 256 MB RAM
* OS: Xbian 1.0 alpha 4 (all settings stock)
* LAN: Ethernet connection over power line adapter
* Location of Videos: USB 2.0 drive attached directly to DD-WRT router, shared via Samba (Windows File Sharing)
* XMBC versions affected: 12, 12.1, 12.2
* Video formats: typically H.264 720p AC3 MKV files, between 500 MB and 10 GB in size

OK so I was going back over the instructions that I posted and I found that they recommended not using the loopback address (127.0.0.1) but instead binding MySQL to the external address of the system.  So I changed this binding, and then for good measure I dropped the user account I was using and then recreated it just to make sure that there was no question about maybe mistyping the password.

One of these two things (or possible both) resolved my problem and I now have and XBMC installation that is using MySQL as desired.

Now for the fun part, getting integration between XBMC and a PS3 Media Server installation integrated and working together!

**Original Message**

Hey all I am building an XBMC box using an old Dual Core Pentium D computer that I had laying around I am running Ubuntu 12.04 as the base OS.

Things are going well, except I can't seem to get XBMC to use the MySQL installation.  I followed the step by step instructions provided here http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Sync_multiple_libraries/Setting_up_MySQL 

and then continuing onto the next steps here http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=HOW-TO:Sync_multiple_libraries/Setting_up_XBMC

But this doesn't seem to have accomplished anything, as far as I can tell XBMC is not using MySQL.  I am sure there are plenty of you out there with much more experience than I have.

Please let me know if there is anything else that you need to help me troubleshoot this installation.

My eventual goal would be to able to use XBMC with a raspberry pi - although i am geographically disadvantaged at the moment and wont be able to get my hands on one till july at the earliest

Thanks

&gt;
&gt;ORIGINAL QUESTION:
&gt;
&gt;I am running RaspBMC on the 42"". I have a NAS server with the video files. Stuff that's of higher resolution (and file size) look alright, but regular sized files as blurry and look like Lifetime movies. 
&gt;
&gt;What I'm wondering is if there's a way to make this watchable, as it is really distracting. Is there a way to scale the image down to be closer to a more watchable resolution rather than stretched across the screen? Or is this just a curse mixed in with the blessing of a large TV.

I'm fairly new to all this - been using XBMC for nearly a year or so now, but mostly to stream Icefilms.

So for my question.. by ""non-traditional"" I mean things like nightly talk shows (Conan, Letterman, Daily Show, Colbert), or weekly episodes of Raw/Smackdown, things that normally come labeled with a date rather than a specific season / episode number attached to them.  Is there a way to scrape for these, OR, are there actually season/episode numbers you can look up somewhere to attach to these kinds of shows?

Also, a little more specific, but I downloaded a DVD set of Ren and Stimpy, which is labeled by disc rather than by season (for instance, ren_and_stimpy.disc01.e01.avi and so on).  Since it's more of a ""best of"" collection rather than pure seasons, they're labeled this way, and tvdb didn't scrape anything for it but the folder name and the artwork - no episodes listed when I follow into it through XBMC.

I'm interested in building a dedicated HTPC for my theatre that would run XBMC.  Probably just go with Windows 7.  I've never messed around with HDMI support for video cards, but I know the majority of video cards these days seem to have HDMI.

Does the HDMI cable simply output the same picture that the DVI connector is sending?

Are there any limitations of the HDMI?  I remember reading about how certain videos or DVDs/Blu-rays have protection built-in that won't allow you it to play over HDMI on a computer or something like this.  Or maybe it was that if you hooked up a Blu-Ray player to a PC, via HDMI and tried to capture the image/sound of the movie, it would be protected and it wouldn't work.  Something like that...

Does audio play out over the HDMI?  Do you have to do anything special to make that happen?  Do you need a special sound card?

I'm thinking about picking up an Apple TV for Airplay mirroring. Would there be any reason to jailbreak it and install XBMC, then use that as my main XBMC install, streaming media from my server?

Off the top of my head, the main advantage would be a dedicated XBMC box, rather than one that's running sickbeard, sabnzbd (which chokes the system on file extraction), iTunes, etc, etc, etc. This would also let me have an XBMC install that I don't have to worry about screwing with when I RDP into the media center. Hell, I could even move the media center to a closet or something, now that I think about it (though, I wouldn't mind gaming on it). 

It would also be kind of nice to have an XBMC that my wife can easily use without ever having to tweak things/switch tasks (I've got my remote/eventghost set up to handle most situations, but it's still sometimes a hassle).

So I got an Xtreamer to serve as a a media player, and plugged in a hard drive to our router to serve as NAS. The problem is that I HATE the xtreamer interface - it's ugly and buggy and in no way user friendly. The only thing it has going for it is the remote which is included. 

So I'm at the end of my rope and want swap back. All I need it for is to do avi decoding from network shares. Best case scenario, I wipe the xtreamer firmware and replace it with linux, but I haven't found any posts online showing other people having done it. I've also thought about buying a used mini-pc.

I could use some advice here. Right now I'm running XBMC on my laptop (Win7), which is hooked up to the tv with an hdmi cable. I'm using the [XBMC remote](https://code.google.com/p/android-xbmcremote/) app on an old LG Optimus via wifi (it's nice to have a dedicated remote). My setup has been working well for the past couple of weeks, and I love what you can do with it. It's the best thing I found since ditching cable. 

Now, if I'm not mistaken, you can use an XBMC install as a server, correct? So if I have other computers on my home network, then they should be able to access media as clients if they also have XBMC installed, right? 

I'd like to run an XBMC server and stream to one or two other laptops *and* to two different tvs as well (there won't be more than one active connection at once; it's just a matter of convenience). What would I do about the two tvs, assuming I don't want to plug in a laptop whenever I want to watch something? Would a Raspberry Pi plugged into each tv be able to connect to my XBMC server? 

Also, there's the question of storage. I'm torn between getting a usb hard drive and a NAS. I can see the benefits of both, but I don't want to eliminate the idea of a NAS just because usb drives are cheaper. My gut tells me to save up for a NAS and do it proper, but my wallet tells me a usb drive should be fine. What do you guys think?

When I look at my file manager the shows are in their correct folder, but in xbmc a bunch of them are under some random show name all mixed together.


Another question I have is there are multiple laptops connected to the same internet over wifi.  I would like to be able to have them stream the movies/shows from my computer.  Both have enabled upnp but when I try and add the location on the laptop I do not see my other computer.

I was just looking for a bit of advice as to what I should go for and was hoping you might be able to help.


First off I'll let you know what I want to do first.

* I want to be able to use XBMC with the add ons for like Netflix, spotify etc. 
* I want to be able to use the web browser through XBMC
* And i would like to be able to stream video's from my pc/possibly a small media server.


From what I've read so far is that the Raspberry Pi can handle all doing all that, so I just have a few questions of how to do it.

* Firstly would it be better to have an external HDD setup plugged into the Pi, have a media server connected or just share the files from my main pc ?
* Should I use Raspbmc or OpenELEC ?
* I'm from Europe, does anyone know if its possible to setup Netflix so you can access the US version like it is possible to do on you PC ?


Of course any other tips or anything else would be greatly appreciated :)

I am merely doing a workaround that I will not have to change every 3 months when it gets patched. So what I am trying to do anyway is just remap certain keys on my remote to open the Hulu and Netflix apps using my Windows Media Center (RC6) Remote.  

I have already followed http://xbmccustomregis.sourceforge.net/index.html this guide and got it all setup and everything is great and dandy it got my ""Green Windows MC (Media Center) Button"" working to open XBMC instead of MC, but that got me thinking that I could remap some of these other keys too. At the moment I already opened the Auto-Hotkey file and tried to read over the script and wanted to just manually do it there, but I quickly realized I had no idea what I was reading. So if anyone could give me some assistance it would be greatly appreciated.  

I mean this is not a huge deal if I cannot resolve it, but it would be nice to have this option when I want it.

**Update** I do realize that I can read the documentation and learn how to script most likely fairly quickly, but was wondering if anyone had found a solution. Documentation is here anyway for those who are interested or were maybe wondering for themselves for a similar project. http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm#Create

**Update** I guess Advanced Launcher is another option, but I would prefer something a little more fluid than that. I would still have to map the keys anyway so I could actually navigate through Hulu and Netflix. As I understand it currently neither support remotes currently.

**Yet another update** I have done a little more research and have come across some similar projects that take advantage of Hulu Desktop and what I assume is the Netflix addon in MC (did not do too much reading into the script as I am unfamiliar with the syntax ect). I will assume with a little modification I should be able to get this working. Something else I ran into was when I located the Windows 8 App installation folder I was unable to run the executable directly. So I made a little shortcut with some custom parameters and I was able to get Netflix working with no issues using: 

    C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c start """" ""Netflix:""

 ;however, Hulu has not proved to be as simple, and I will continue working on this.  The script I am using as an example for autohotkey is http://www.solvetechnology.com/temp/htpc/htpc%20write%20up.txt .

**Sadly this is not possible right now :(** Due to Hulu and Netflix not having even keyboard support at the current moment no matter what you do the remote will not work unless it has a mouse feature built in too; however, my launchers are working and all that I had to do was use some modified scripts from http://www.itsjustwhatever.com/2012/11/01/xbmc-metro-app-launcher/ he has a Hulu one too which you will need. As for the one I linked too just rename the file to ""Netflix"" and it will do the rest for you.  Just to let you guys know with my remote the escape key is mapped to ""Clear"". Pressing this button will close netflix and bring you back to XBMC and close the script. The Hulu one I have not tested if it closes afterwards, but you can always modify his code and make it do it. So I guess that is all for now. I will create another thread sometime in the future when this is a possibility. I will do a complete tutorial from start to finish including my entire system build.

So, is it just frame rate issues that would prevent this build from having Oppo like video quality or is there something I'm not seeing?  Does the actual HD image have the same clarity and depth as a really good BR player?  It seems hard to imagine from a 30-50 dollar graphics card.

Nearly one month after the release of Beta 2, the latest Dharma pre-release is ready for testing. We have been working very hard to to stabilize XBMC for the final release; there have been over 300 commits to the release branch since the last beta. Notable fixes include:

    * Lots of Live fixes and clean-ups. We want Dharma Live to work out-of-the-box as much as possible. Those who have been plagued with broken ALSA upgrades and unsupported soundcards will be happy to know that these issues have been resolved. In addition, most ION/ION2 systems should just work ™, though there are a few small issues remaining.
    * Shoutcast, which is now an add-on, was causing hard-freezes. Now Fixed.
    * A bug causing redundant http requests has been fixed. Scraper sites (Hi TMDb and TheTVDB!) should see significantly less requests per session.
    * Several new addons. Many scrapers have been fixed. The popular Transparency! skin is now in the official repository; a total of 9 available even before official release!.
    * Many more small fixes. Small fixes are good.


There are still a few known bugs:

    * CrystalHD support is great, but drivers and libraries still require manual intervention for installation in Live/Linux. This may or may not be fixed in time for release.
    * No packages for Ubuntu Maverick are available as of now. We’re working hard on this.
    * A few small miscellaneous bugs. Small bugs are bad.",,False,,t5_2qhno,False,,,True,t3_drbnk,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/drbnk/dharma_beta_3_is_now_available/,

I have tried to do research to solve the issue and I have asked about it on IRC to no avail. Hopefully someone has heard of this before. I'm running XBMC 12.2. Whenever I watch movies or television shows on XBMC the video looks great most of the time. However, often the video will appear tinted, discolored, or glitchy from time to time. Whenever I press the ""\"" key to change from full screen to maximized, the graphical issues go away. The videos play fine, but they look bad. Here is a list of stray observations that I have made that may or may not help us figure out the issue:

* The graphical issues don't always occur. I cannot figure out what causes it to occur.
* Powering off or unplugging my TV doesn't seem to help.
* Restarting my HTPC after noticing the graphical issues does seem to help the issues, but they always occur again.
* The issue doesn't occur when I'm navigating through XBMC menus in full screen. The issue only occurs with video playback.
* I initially tried to take screenshots of the issue occurring, but the glitches/tint/discoloration will not show up in my screenshots

I can't ping 192.168.1.125 from a windows computer but it must be connected since it's streaming from that machine.  The ip address in xbmc shows 127.0.0.1 but when i go to settings in android it shows 192.168.1.125

3. The remote that comes with it is borderline worthless?  It lags and is horrible.

I'm coming from using a dedicated ion machine running open elec so maybe i'm expecting too much from this thing...

I was having this problem earlier but I thought it was because my graphics card was DVI and it was related to some sort of audio issue since I was using a DVI -&gt; HDMI cable to connect to my TV.  I messed around with using a S/PDIF cable to connect my graphics card to my motherboard so I could send sound through DVI ([original thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/1b4ljq/problems_playing_video_streaming_with_addons/)) but it didn't work so I ended up just ended up switching out my video card to one that supports HDMI out.

After I install XBMCbuntu on my machine, when I boot, all I get is a black screen and cursor. There is no way to move the cursor and no keyboard input is recognized. This is only when I install vanilla XBMC v12 Frodo. v11 Eden worked perfectly fine before. But, when I install OpenElec v2.0 (I haven't tried 3.0 yet) XBMCbuntu works perfectly fine.  
So, what could possibly be causing this? Would it be worth fixing, or should I just stick with OpenElec? If I do stick with Open, what could I be missing out on if I don't have vanilla XBMCbuntu? I'm not very linux savvy, so I'd rather stick with a version that wouldn't require me to delve too deeply into terminal commands or that sort of thing.

Windows has the advantage of Steam support which could be fun.  Money isn't really an issue though it does seem funny a $60 Android stick seems to compete pretty well with $400 HTPCs.  Or am I mistaken?

I had XBMC on a soft-modded original Xbox back in the day.  Loved it to death.  Until 1080p started becoming more prevalent. After running a few years with straight samba shares and VLC in XP I've finally purchased a TV of my own, Bluray player, Receiver, etc.  Would love to revisit XBMC on dedicated hardware because even though these devices are ""smart"" and have Amazon, Netflix, DLNA, they are still crap at playing LAN files.  Would like one device to watch and listen to all my stuff so Netflix/Amazon/Hulu integration would be a plus...though it sounds like I maybe should just stick with smart-tv versions of these apps...I'm mostly a LAN file kinda guy anyways.

My problem is trying to navigate through the entirety of my music collection, create playlists, and control what to play.   I've read that a Music Player Daemon is a good solution but I am still somewhat lost when it comes to how to implement it.  

I get the XBMC has an MPD add-on.  If I install it, will I then be able to create playlists and control the music from my laptop but have it play through the XBMC?

Am i missing where the option is, or has it gone?
Is there anything i can do to force a different view for each folder? (basically i want media Info 3 for my TV Show folder and FanArt for my movies folder).

To be clear, I have 2 structures.

VIDEOS &gt; FILES &gt; MOVIES - Up to this point, the views are retained.

I've been trying to setup an HTPC at home and am running into a couple of problems with XBMC that I was wondering if anyone could provide some guidance! Thanks so much!

Using XBMC Eden

1) Properly setup mysql and login works as xbmc is able to create its database and tables. However it seems to not add anything to the db unless unless it is from ""import library"" (which works correctly). If I add a new media file and run Update Library it doesn't show up in the library, no metadata is scraped, and nothing shows up in the mysql databse for that item... thoughts?

2) Trying to use hulu plugin from bluecop. It works fine on its own except that I am unfortunately in Canada and apparently the MPAA would rather that I steal their shows than try to legitimately pay for them. Anyway, I am using blockless (changed to their DNS servers) that works fine from the browser but seems to make the add-on unstable. I get a lot of 404s and plugin errors before finally getting some data back. It is a bit odd how it is on-and-off... Any thoughts here? Thanks!

I have been toying with the idea of having a touchscreen media center in my Jeep. I have an old Macbook that I've played around with using XBMC, but ran into a few roadblocks and haven't done much since. Thought I'd run some ideas by you.

Already have:

 * Macbook
 * Powermate jog wheel
 * Mimo 720s USB touchscreen that I bought on a whim

Some may scoff at the Macbook, but I already had it laying around (and use Apple stuff for everything else, anyway). Could get a micro pc or raspberry pi, or build something. Doesn't seem like itunes integrates very well with XBMC.

The biggest issue that stopped me was that there wasn't a good skin for XBMC that could use a touchscreen and/or jog wheel to navigate. So I started writing my own, but that has been time-consuming and has a big learning curve.

""you can press c on the keyboard to bring up the context menu to add a source""

I recently bought a Linksys E3000 router with USB media sharing.  I have an external USB drive hanging off the router and it's shared out to my network.  When SAB downloads an episode it is configured to put it in the appropriate directory on the share.  

When I'm watching something from the share and SAB is unpacking to the share my playback pauses (seems to be buffering).  I can push play and it will play a few more seconds before it pauses again. 

Is there a way to tell XBMC to buffer more of the video file so I can avoid a stop in playback?  

I have seen on the forums that you can edit an xml file to tell XBMC exactly how much to buffer, but I'm wondering if there's another way.

I've uploaded a *very* rough mockup of some provisional ideas i've had which can be viewed [on imgur](http://i.imgur.com/mf2ro.jpg).

The idea of the app is to better bridge the gap between XBMC and bittorrent. I'm quite new to XBMC but after downloading the XBMC Commander app for iPad (highly recommended btw), i thought it'd be cool to allow for new content to be found and added to the library via a similar mechanism, enter TorrentScrape.

TorrentScrape is an app which scrapes bittorrent trackers (currently thepiratebay only), converting torrent filenames to queryable data e.g. 'The.Rum.Diary.2011.DVDRiP.AC3-5.1.XviD-SiC' and then scrapes various publicly available resources to download associated artwork, cast, plot synopsis etc. categorising this data accordingly.

Compatible with the Transmission bittorrent client, it will then use RPC calls to control the client, allowing for users to simply hit 'download' and have the associated file download automatically to your configured Transmission client. Once complete, they'll pop into your library as usual.

So, i'm basically after some feedback on the proposed idea: would you use it? is there anything else you'd like incorporated? any suggestions?

So far i'm thinking:

- Top Movies (today's top seeded movies)
- Top TV Shows (today's top seeded tv shows)
- Search (search for specific titles, will generate list of results sorted by seed count)
- DL Manager (UI control for Transmission client, similar to web ui client)
- Recommendations (not seen in mockup) - Using the tastekid api, generating recommended titles based on your recent downloads.
- News feed, upcoming movie releases.",,False,,t5_2qhno,False,,,True,t3_pd53n,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/pd53n/torrentscrape_ipad_app_suggestionsfeedback/,

It's full DLNA client so it can easily play back stuff over XBMC UPnP service. But that's about it - TV has no external service access capability, for example no youtube link, even as it easily plays back video files downloaded from youtube and shared over UPnP service.

So I would like to use XBMC as a fancy remote - it could access (let's go with youtube example) youtube, stream whatever it gets from external source directly out again through its own UPnP service and command TV as video renderer to play back that specific source. And that would make any crappy laptop/netbook (with touch-screen? yay!) fancy remote running XBMC control interface, while all the rendering and video decoding would happen on the TV. Laptop does not even have to be capable of rendering HD content, it just needs to have good enough network interface to stream and forward it. All that without any video cables, just using local network.

After few hours of crazy clicking in circles, the closest thing I could find is some sort of extra advanced external player configuration, that would be usable if I find a media player that would do that forwarding/controlling thing.. maybe. Seeking/pausing would still be done by that external player interface, which feels ugly. 

[coherence](http://coherence.beebits.net/) framework apparently provides backends that present themselves as DLNA media server(s). I can browse youtube through that using built in client on TV, but it's pretty clumsy to navigate with a remote ( coherence also seems buggy or maybe is not updated to use latest librarie versions ).

If coherence can provide such transparent youtube source and XBMC has also youtube plugins to play stuff from there, only thing missing from XBMC seems to be the remote device control interface/default UPnP output device configuration.

I don't have anything X-Files related anywhere as far as I know, so I don't know what it's doing here.  It also takes one movie file I have and [lists is 10 or so times.](http://imgur.com/rYY2J.png).  These listings are also actually TV shows.  I have my TV Shows and Movies in separate directories and each category in XBMC's content is only pointing to one folder so I don't know how it's crossing the two.

For some random reason, XBMC lost my settings, which included my PseudoTV channels.  I have been able to recreate all but one of my channels, and I am hoping that someone can help me out on the last one.  I used to have a channel (lets say, channel 30) that would play five of my favorite shows in a specific order. These five shows are on channels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 - so I set up channel 30 to interlace these five channels, but doing this seems to make the shows play the shows in random order, not show 1, then show 2, and so on.  

Can someone help me with what I am doing wrong?  Specifically, I think the ""Min/Max Interleave Count"" settings are the key to doing this - but I cannot find any documentation that actually tells me what these mean.  Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks!


**UPDATE**:  I figured it out!  I swear I tried this before, but maybe I didn't get the Min/Max Interleave Count settings just right.  What I had to do was to:

* Set up a new channel that was set to play only Show 1.
* Then, in the advanced options, I interleaved Channel 2 (where show 2 is playing nonstop) with a Min Interleave and Max Interleave Count both set to 1.
* Then another advanced setting to interleave Channel 3 with a Min Interleave and Max Interleave Count both set to 2.
* Next, another advanced setting to interleave Channel 4 with a Min Interleave and Max Interleave Count both set to 3.
* Finally, a last advanced setting to interleave Channel 5 with a Min Interleave and Max Interleave Count both set to 4. 

This gets me a channel that plays a random episode of Show 1, then a random episode of Show 2, and so on. After a random episode of Show 5 is over, another episode of Show 1 airs to begin the cycle again.

Sorry for making another thread about it.,cupojoe999,8,2,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/1fi3pb/yet_another_xbmc_box_question_sorry_for_making/,"What would be the best option for a standalone xbmc box preferably for under $100, but no more than $300?  There are so many options I just don't know where to start looking.

I'm trying to find something that is powerful enough to play any hd downloaded videos from my external hdd, or any various stream I find with out lagging.  I'm not two concerned over fan noise, as long as the box will not run very hot.  Internal storage is not needed because I will stream everything or its on an external drive.  The smaller the better but I don't have a size limitation either.  Wifi is needed, my router is on the first floor, and this box if going up stairs.  HDMI audio and video is a must.  Power consumption is a concern as well; I tried to use an old dell xps 400 that I had in the garage but it pulled too much power.  My house is old and 4 rooms share the same circuit.  After about 10 minutes I blew the fuse with the 400 plugged in.  So low power is a must.  Netflix support would be nice, but I have a ps3 and a laptop (that I currently use with xbmc, at a slight inconvenience sometimes) that do netflix just fine.  I would also like it to run on windows, not openelec or xbmcbuntu or any of the other linux, android etc options.  Its just a personal preference of mine. I mess with Linux as a hobby, but if I encounter a hardware or software issue Windows is much easier for me to troubleshoot.  

I have looked at the raspberry Pi but I just don't know how fast or smooth it will run.  Especially when I try to play blu ray rips of anime series.  

I don't want an atv or atv2 because I have heard they are slow at times, and I have a bit of an anti apple bias already (lots of bad experiences with that company)


This little box has intrigued me but I dont know enough about it, so if anyone uses this could you give me a review of it?
http://androidtvbox.us/products/g-box-midnight/#tab-crum-1

I have also read about the zotec and other mini PCs but I just dont know how the power consumption would be or how fast they would navigate. 

I also am interested in the intell NUC, but it is over $100 and still requires some parts.  
http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/motherboards/desktop-motherboards/nuc.html

Is $100 too low of a price to get a good box with my desired uses or do I need to bump my budget up to the $300 range?

I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the addon, I ran a maintenance fix from the XBMCHUB folks and I've updated to 12.2, but no dice. Is there anything I can do to try and fix it? Will there be an update that fixes it for me if I just wait patiently?

My setup is MacPro with OSX 10.8.2 -&gt; WiFi router -&gt; iPad 4G with iOS 6.1.1, jailbroken. The problem is that I can't make video from mac to get streamed to my iOS device. Here's what I tried:

1) **UPnP**. I've tried both native XBMC solution and [ps3ms](http://www.ps3mediaserver.org/). The service seems to be running on a mac, but when I try to search for UPnP services on an iPad, nothing shows up.

2) **SMB**. Tried SMBUp, seems to be somewhat working on mac, but again can't see anything to show up in XBMC on iPad when adding video sorces

3) **Zeroconf browser and NFS**. I've tried a few solutions from XBMC wiki (like for instance the NFS manager), and for some reason this magically worked for me, I've seen two options for NFS and FTP services in browser, and successfully watched videos over NFS for some time, until it magically disappeared the same way it showed up in browser. I still have no idea how to get that NFS thing back though.

I would also prefer this to be encrypted.

I have tried setting up a webdav server using [this](http://www.slickit.ca/2009/07/webdav-on-windows-7.html) guide, but he leaves out the fact that both Windows Authentication and SSL seem to be omitted from W7HP.  Even without those things, I still couldn't get it to work though.  XBMC just says ""working"" and fails to connect.

I do have a fully functional FTP server up and running. SSL included.  But then I found out that XBMC doesn't support SSL.

I tried mounting my FTP site as a drive in windows.  I was then planning to point XBMC at the files and possibly that would work? Didn't matter.  I could never get windows 7 to access my FTP server.  I suspect SSL was the culprit again.

I know people hate it when you don't google things. But trust me I have.  XBMC wiki, various sources from google searches etc. I've looked.

Am I being too paranoid with my encryption demands?  My FTP server used to get pounded from chinese IP adresses all the time until I learned about IP banning.

I'm running XBMC under linux on an Acer Revo, connected to a Samsung TV directly with HDMI. I'm using the TV speakers (2 channel).

A lot of the video files I play have an audio problem which I guess is to do with muxing the surround sound audio into two channels, but I'm not sure. The symptom is that the levels seem very off, some things are very loud - others are very quiet, and not necessarily in the way I'd expect. The dialogue is often very quiet so the volume needs to be increased, but moments of action will be deafeningly loud.

In a surround sound setup I'd compensate by turning up the centre channel, but this isn't possible with this current two channel setup. The problem occurs with DVDs and video files, I assumed it would be restricted to sources with a surround sound track, but I do get it on files with stereo audio - though I guess those could be false positives.

It's very frustrating and has pretty much stopped me watching movies in the evenings, as I have to sit with a remote control in hand and constantly adjust the volume. If anyone can make any recommendations (other than ""buy a decent receiver"", which I can't do right now) I'd love to hear them!  I'm posting this to the XBMC subreddit because I know there are a lot of knowledgeable people here, and it's obviously the part of the setup I can do the most tinkering with.",,False,,t5_2qhno,False,,,True,t3_132cst,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/132cst/surround_sound_volume_issues/,

Been using xbmc for a while now but never really had to overhaul anything until today. I added another harddrive into my media pc and moved all my films from the old harddrive to the new one.
Then I added the new location into xmbc and started to scrape the info down (like a complete tool, i cleaned up instead of exporting the movie info)

Now when i view movies, the art is there, along with the plot however the film title is missing. 

Ive had a look around on the xbmc forums but this problem only seems to be from around 2010 and it suggests i use a new version of the imdb.xml scraper (which seems to be hard to find)

Im completely stumped with this... Also im not that technical so if theres any additional info needed, then i can get it, providing you talk to me like a 7 year old :)",,False,,t5_2qhno,False,,,True,t3_vjk6c,http://www.reddit.com/r/xbmc/comments/vjk6c/issues_with_scraping_movie_info/,

I'm using XBMC with the library on a MySQL database so my whole house (three XBMC installs) can use the same information.  I'd working awesome, but I do have one small problem.

I have my TV shows on a share called ""Television"", but after the directory became large, I started making sub-folders called ""Animation"", ""Comedy"", ""Drama"", ""Sci-Fi"", etc.  The problem is that some of the folders get scrapped by XBMC as shows.  The ""Comedy"" folder, which in reality holds maybe 10 other shows (which do get scrapped correctly) is believed to be a show called ""/Comedy"".  There doesn't seem to be a way to ""Remove from Library"" without it getting scrapped the next time XBMC looks.

Is there a way to 1) remove some folder names, but not it's contents and 2) make the folder name itself never scrapped again?

I guess now that I've stopped using my PS3 as my main media receiver, I can put all the TV shows back into one folder, but that would mean deleting my current XBMC library and re-doing it, as well as reconfiguring all of SickBeard and other applications.

&gt; Pros: - Insides are very nice, I like the chamber separation of the power supply, motherboard, and HDDs.
- LCD is nice and easily readable.
- Looks very sharp next to the rest of my stuff by the TV.
- The remote is excellent except for some minor points, almost like it was made for XBMC. Plenty of buttons for everything, and pretty much works out of the box, with some minor XML file tweaking making it work perfectly.
- Close enough to silent that I've never heard the fans running, even with everything else turned off.

&gt; Cons: - Using a 2.5"" HDD (or SSD) is very awkward since the DVD drive bay goes right above it. I was using an IDE DVD drive and had a hard time getting both in the case and fastened down without accidently unplugging either one.
- If let the remote control the power on/off, the LCD goes into full brightness with a blank display when the machine is turned off. There is no workaround for Linux that I could find, I do not know if the same problem affects Windows though I believe it does since it seems to be a LCD firmware/hardware bug. I worked around this by simply leaving the machine on 24/7.
- The analog stick thing on the remote is somewhat annoying, I would have prefered simple directional buttons. It can be very sensitive, although any decent software will let you adjust this I suppose.

&gt; Other Thoughts: I bought it to use with XBMC live on Linux, and I love it. The remote works perfectly after fixing some mistakes in XBMC's remote config files and basic remote stuff worked pretty much right out of the box, along with the LCD. The volume knob took some research to get working but was still pretty easy. By default, the small icons around the edge of the LCD do not work with XBMC, but there is a perl script floating around that can work them. The only really show-stopper issue is the power-off/full-brightness LCD thing I mentioned, so if you can live with that or one of the workarounds (I believe not hooking the LCD remote power controlling cable up to the motherboard power cable fixes it but disables controlling power through the remote) then it's perfect!

Thanks for looking readers.

What I want to do is rip my DVD collection to disc.  I have WinxDVD ripper and can rip most of them easily to straight mpeg2 for best quality.  But it only allows 1 audio stream.  My wife and I have lots of Anime films that we enjoy watching in Japanese w/ subtitles.  But our 3 year old likes to watch them in English.  Rather than rip it twice, I'd like to rip it to one file with both audio tracks and subtitles.  I believe MKV is the best container, but I'm not sure how to do it.  I really want a simple solution, preferably 1 or 2 clicks.  I hear DVDFab is good, but will it rip one DVD to an MKV w/ multiple audio streams and subtitles?

The Story So Far

So I have XBMC installed and it's working nicely I followed their step-by-step wiki. Great.

Check around and in order to get the remote working, I have to grab LIRC through the terminal. I do that, but botch the installation by hitting the wrong option for IR remote. It won't let me go back and fix it! Crap!

No matter, remove and re-install, right? Nope. No dice. Doing so just picks up the old preferences, it would seem, and I'm concerned about uninstalling the headers it installed on the off chance that I fudge the removal. I really don't want to have to redo this whole damn thing.

Yes, I should have made a system backup first, foolish me.

Anyway. Now I want to uninstall LIRC, and do it right.

Does anyone have a handy step-by-step guide for this? Bare in mind, I'm fairly new to all of this (though not shy about programing or general IT stuff, the Linux world is new to me).

We've written a bit of software which once installed on your computer, allows you to control software on your PC / Mac with your phone or tablet.  This would include XBMC.

When using XBMC Apptui allows you to swap between three different remotes depending on what you are looking to do.  You can navigate between a general navigation tab, a player head controller and volume controls.

In general Apptui changes as you interact with your computer providing you controls, on your phone, for the software you are using or the website you are viewing.

We currently have remotes for applications such as XBMC, Windows Media Center, Media Portal, Plex, Photoshop, iTunes and VLC as well as a boat load of websites including Netflix, Vimeo, YouTube, Facebook and TED.

We call it Apptui and you can download it here:

I hope I'm posting in the correct subreddit for this.

I've been having issues with scrapping from, basically, any source since upgrading to Frodo (Openelec 3.0.3 - RaspberryPi build). Whenever I set a library update going, I get ""cannot connect to remote server"", regardless of the scrapper (I'm using TheTVDB, XEN, AniDB.net and TheMovieDB) or the media name. Every time I scrape, the first file/movie/tv show fails, but the next one runs ""fine"" (see below).

I'd left my Pi on scraping for a full 24 hour period and it seems to have found information for most of my stuff (it was able to find it all in 3.0.1), but it has added 5-10 episodes for each tv show, maximum. Even when there are shows with over 100 episodes, it's only scrapping info for the first 5 or so.

I'd had to rebuild my library after upgrading because my housemate had cleared it for ... no real reason that I can tell.
Any ideas on what I can try?

edit: I've turned on the debug log when scraping, and caught to separate errors on separate occasions [log 1](http://pastebin.com/x9W4rQd8) and [log 2](http://pastebin.com/PDWs8mJC)

I've set up a MySQL library from my main HTPC using the Wiki.  All is good except I've got a duplicated library.

The first library scan I did was on the main system which has the hard drives plugged into it (and is connected to the TV via HDMI), and this carried across to the other XBMC boxes I have.  They couldn't find that file, and under the 'Information' section it seems like the remote boxes are trying to play the file from E:/Media/Movies, which is the local path on the main HTPC.

So I scanned again from a remote box, which gave a second entry with the path SMB://ASPIRE-X10/Media/Movies.  Using that entry, I've been able to play/pause/resume across my phone, tablet and Raspberry Pi, but the main HTPC can't find them.

What I'm after is a single library that can be played on either the local or remote XBMC sessions.  Is this possible?

Any help much appreciated!

The general consensus seemed to be that you should just setup profiles for each of your kids; use smart playlists to filter your library; and use a customizable skin that you've configured to show only the smart playlists...

I've been updating my library to include specific genres to use in the smart playlsits.  I finally completed that today and setup a couple of smart playlists to test with.  The smart playlist works fine but the issue is that the search function searches the entire library, not just the playlist. 

So if I'm a kid and I click on TV Shows on the main XBMC screen and the smart playlist brings back a list of shows that match the genres I've configured (ex: Age 8-12).  Then I sneakily go to search and search for something generic and it brings back a list of shows from the main library - including shows that are not in the playlist.  If I now select one of those shows it switches to that folder in the library and then if I go up a folder I'm able to see everything in the library...

I guess I should've just asked you guys first but has anyone figured out a good, solid way of implementing some sort of parental controls?  I mean short of creating separate source folders for each kid or having separate libraries for each profile.  I could do that but maintenance would be painful...

I started with a 40GB hard drive which was rapidly upgraded to 160GB and then to 500GB--by which time I had replaced the box with a slightly better Pentium box with hyperthreading. I now have an original XBOX which I also use with XBMC, but mostly only play music and emulation on it and I got this last year, so I came in very very late to XBMC on the XBOX.

These days I have an older Pentium Core 2 Dual running Ubuntu and intel onboard video, which seems to work well enough. I rarely if ever surpass 1GB of the 2GBs of RAM it has, and I have noticed no real issues with playback. I have a USB WiFi card which connects to the local WiFi router with an IOMEGA 1TB NAS filled with mostly h.264 encoded shows and a few DIVX encodes of older shows that seem to have missed out on getting DVD releases. The problem is that the interface seems to keep getting slower for me, as does the time it takes to actually start a video playing.

I know (based on the explosion of popularity in Android htpc sticks as well as consoles like OUYA supporting XBMC out of the box) that streaming is going to be the future, but I wonder if maybe I moved too quickly to making my entire setup to be streaming only?

Is it better to continue to optimize for networked video playback or am I better off to start building a powerful HTPC with multiple storage bays and load those with terabyte hard drives? I don't know.

Which direction is the best performance? What is most likely to still work in five years? In ten years from now?

Here's what I know (or *think I know*) about them:

* Xios sells for **~~about $90~~** about $115; U2 for $89. **However** for many users, the U2 will require $10 to $50 in add-ons. 
* Both have a 1.7ghz ARM Cortex-A9 cpu. Odroid says that theirs is quad core. Pivos doesn't say. Maybe all A9s are the same? Color me stupid for not knowing.
* Pivos has 3 USB 2.0 ports; Odroid has 2.
* Both have wired (10/100) and wireless networking. The wireless on the Xios is built in. On the Odroid, it's a $12.00 add-on. I don't care, because I'd never use a media streamer with Wifi anyway.
* Both have HDMI out. I can't find specs on whether their HDMI is 1.4 (first to support 3D video), 1.3 or older. 
* Both have a Micro SD slot. Pivos says that theirs ""*supports up to 32gb*"" so it must be SDHC (which has a max of 32gb). It's unknown whether the Odroid supports SDXC (which, in theory, can support up to 2tb, although nobody makes any bigger than 128gb currently), or only SDHC like the Pivos.
* The Odroid gives the option to use eMMC add-on memory which is considerably faster than Micro SD Class 10 memory. You can buy eMMC modules in 8gb, 16gb and 64gb. FWIW, I use ""UHS 1"" SD cards in my Nikon, which are even faster than eMMC. Think of UHS 1 cards as being something like Class 30 or 40, if there were such a thing. However, there's no indication that either the Xios or the Odroid can use a UHS-1 Micro SD card anyway. 
* The Pivos people really tout that they were the first to have XBMC for Android and were intimately involved in its development. Blah, blah, blah. Now that XBMC for Android is out of Beta, I'm not sure that this matters much, but YMMV.
* The Xios is ""*rootable*"". The Odroid comes rooted. 
* The Xios comes in a nifty looking case. The Odroid doesn't come with a case at all. It's just a little board mounted to a helluva aluminum heat sink. There are a variety of 3d party cases available for the Odroid for those of us nervous to have exposed electronics around kids.
* There are reports of the Xios getting hot enough to fry an egg, but the Food Channel has yet to confirm.

It sounds like a good excuse to get rid of our Comcast cable and save a boatload of $$$ per month. But first, I have a few questions.

1) How soon are new TV shows added on? My GF and I watch Dexter, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Homeland, etc... Is it possible to stream these shows live? If not, how long after they air are you able to watch them?

2) Should I be concerned about being able to watch all my sports teams? I'm a huge NBA &amp; NFL fan and I need to be able to watch my guys play on any given night! Have there ever been times when you tried watching a sports event but couldn't? Keep in mind, I don't watch any obscure sports, mainly just basketball, football, and soccer.

3) Would it be easy enough for my non-tech savvy girlfriend to figure out?

4) Any recommendations for a setup? Apple TV? Something else? If it helps, I will mainly be using it to stream movies, shows, music, and also play movies/shows that I have saved to my computer (not sure if I still will with XBMC). If you could point me in the right direction that would be great!

5) Any recommendations on a TV? Any must-have features I need? I've been holding out on getting a new TV for a while now (because I HATE the input lag I get when I play Xbox on HD TVs, but that's another story...). However, I'm not sure how much longer my old tube is going to last so I may end up getting a new flat screen in the near future. What features should I look for?

I have it opening at start up and leave it logged in whenever I use my computer. I'm looking for a way to minimize the amount of programs running in the background of the XBMC acct to the bare minimum so that it will start up as quick as possible and use as little resources as possible while logged-in in the background. I've already tried using msconfig to stop unwanted programs from opening at startup, but that affects all users. I just want to configure the XBMC acct. I don't know of any other way to do this.
