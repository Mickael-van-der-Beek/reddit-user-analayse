**Sega's Time Traveler** Sucky game, but when I walked in Dairy Queen and saw that hologram cowboy, I couldn't believe it.

1365700347.0,31,self.cade,1c598u,[pics] My basement arcade... a sad story with a happy ending,darthphunk,37,6,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1c598u/pics_my_basement_arcade_a_sad_story_with_a_happy/,"My wife agreed we should get a house with a full basement so I could build a basement bar/arcade. We found a house close to downtown, yet secluded and peaceful. It was right on the creek, peaceful, cute... a good house. Our only reservation, is that it was in a flood zone. The last flood was in 96, the one before that around 30 years ago. 

We got the house... and I got to work.

Here are some before shots of the gross, ugly wet basement:

http://imgur.com/a/CvKW3

Here are some progress pics of the basement renovation (which I did myself):

http://imgur.com/a/GJKtf

I built the bar from scratch and made a nerd montage and sealed it in acrylic for the bartop:

http://imgur.com/a/SAcMP

Here was the finished product (I am not in any of these photos):

http://imgur.com/a/R6T2Y

Then... the flood happened

It was about 8:00AM and we had been having some pretty heavy rain.  I had just taken my kids to school. I was out back drinking a cup of coffee looking at the creek roaring by... and I called my wife. ""Hey sweetie.  You should come home now... I think we are going to have a problem today.""

Sure enough, we had a problem.

My wife came home and I called my brother in law to come help out.  As soon as my brother in law got here, a torrent of water started rushing by the front of the house.  We had to leave to get sandbags. I called a friend of mine to come help my wife. We came back with only 10 or so sandbags. The city ran out and was expecting more trucks of sand from neighboring cities and other quarries.

When we got back, water was pouring in to the basement. Lucky for us, it only was coming in through the windows by the utility area right next to the sump well and not by any games. We did a pretty admiral job of keeping water under control for a few hours. It became apparent that we weren't going to be able to stay ahead of it all day, and we needed to start getting games and personal items out.

We called over more friends who weren't dealing with flooding and we had about 20 people over that day from morning till evening. To top it all off... I was running a temperature of 102 degrees. I had planned on resting all day. I helped as much as I could... I was physically a reck from being in frigid water all day and dealing with a high fever.

My friends, and me when I could, hauled 14 games and one big ass jukebox out of the basement that evening in record time... up stairs.

Before and after shots:

http://imgur.com/a/loBit

We managed to save all of the games. The washer and dryer were completely drenched early on so we didn't bother to take them. Our furnace was trashed as was our water heater. The only thing that was really trashed was the basement. All of the water came at us from the front of the house and not the creek behind us. The water breached a bridge up the street and came at us from the other direction. We were eventually able to get enough sandbags to channel water around our house (for the most part) and divert water back in to the creek in the back yard (which didn't breech our yard for some reason)

HAPPY ENDING: I was able to rebuild and reconfigure the basement and today it's a fun game room again.  It's got more room, better flow, and is better protected from flood waters. I have no pictures currently because it's not quite where I want it... but as soon as I do I will post them here.

BONUS F.A.Q.

""Hey darthphunk? Why the hell would you have a basement arcade in a house on a flood plane next to a creek? Are you a goddamned moron?"" 

Good question, asshole! As I said before, the last flood was in 96, and the one before that was 30 years ago. I, as well as contractors and neighbors who have been there 30+ years figured I had enough time to upgrade the property to deal with high water levels.  It came earlier than anyone suspected.",,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,pow,True,t3_1c598u,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1c598u/pics_my_basement_arcade_a_sad_story_with_a_happy/,
1365606020.0,27,self.cade,1c2dok,"A quick tip for people that post ""Should I buy this?"" threads...",darthphunk,33,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1c2dok/a_quick_tip_for_people_that_post_should_i_buy/,"I've seen a few threads here where people ask if they should buy a cabinet at a cheap price and they either missed out because it was sold already or are ""waiting to hear back""

If you see something pop up on Craigslist or through any other means that lists a cheap arcade game, please consider the following:

If it's a game you like, and it's crazy cheap (like say under $150), don't post a thread about it... just go get it. Immediately. Call them and say ""I'll come now with cash"" and go get it.

The only thing that would give me pause would be severe water damage, extreme physical damage, or some weird obscure/terrible game that doesn't sound fun. 

If it's relatively intact and you think it might be cool/fun... just get it.

Here's the deal.  If you see something crazy like ""Pac Man cabinet. Turns on but screen is scrambled... $100"" or ""Galaga machine, works fine $75 bucks""... those are crackhead prices and if you don't act immediately, someone will undoubtedly snatch it up while you are composing your ""should I buy this"" post on Reddit. At such a low price point, in the worst case scenario you could likely recoup the cost of the original sale by selling the parts or have a good start for a restoration or (shudder) mame cabinet.

Best case scenario, you have a working or semi working arcade cabinet.

When you get in to the higher price range, then ask about it. Your average Jamma cabinet in good working order is worth around $300 and will be higher or lower depending on the cabinet/game.  Your average glassic or golden age arcade game in good working order is worth $400 to $800 depending on the game.

At around a hundred bucks... there's not a whole lot that can go wrong.

If something like that comes up... run, don't walk.  Go get it.",,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,pow,True,t3_1c2dok,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1c2dok/a_quick_tip_for_people_that_post_should_i_buy/,

**TL:DR** *I bought a 1983 Atari Star Wars cockpit arcade cabinet. It is awesome. My wife is a saint who let me spend entirely too much and didn't even flinch when I had to tear into our ceiling, and now I owe my friends big time for helping me move this behemoth.* 

Ever since I was a kid, there's one arcade game that I've coveted - the 1983 Atari Star Wars arcade machine, particularly the cockpit version. I used to play this game all the time at the amazing Celebrity Sports Center in Denver, Co (actually it was probably technically in Glendale, but whatever). I've always been massively into games and also a big Star Wars geek, so this machine was always a convergence of two of my biggest passions.

From time to time I'd search for this machine and dream of buying it. Last week I came across a really nice stand up version of this cabinet. I was super excited due to its condition and almost pulled the trigger on the deal, but the price was such that I definitely needed to think it through and not act impulsively. During this period of ""Should I or Shouldn't I"" introspection I kept thinking ""This thing is cool and in great shape, but if only I could find a cockpit."" 

On a whim I looked for ""Star Wars Arcade"" on Craigslist and I was absolutely stunned to discover a cockpit being sold locally. From the pictures it looked to be in good shape and it also had an Empire Strikes Back board installed so that either game could be played on demand with the flick of a switch.  

The price was quite a bit lower than I expected - the seller was asking for $3000, but I'd seen these listed for $6000 from time to time. I don't know if those sold at that price, but 3K definitely seemed fair. The seller was moving out of state and didn't want to deal with moving it and then trying to find space in a smaller place, so he was motivated to part with the machine before his move, which was a lucky break for me. Unfortunately 3K was also quite steep for something I hadn't budgeted for at all... but I knew that this was a rare opportunity and i would regret it forever if I didn't at least try. 

I contacted the seller and offered what I could pull together at the moment - $2100 (luckily for me my family had recently received our tax return and we decided to squirrel it away as an emergency fund, otherwise I probably wouldn't have had this much liquid at such short notice). The seller countered that my offer was lower than he wanted and that $2500 would be the lowest he would be willing to accept. 

$2500 was the absolute max I would be able to get and I let him know this. He had said there was another interested party and I was resigned to the fact that if they offered any more than that, I would not get the machine. Amazingly he told me that whoever came and picked it up first at $2500 would get it. Now I was reeling... I had the money and I had the go-ahead from the seller, but it sounded like a race between me and someone else. I had to act right away. 

I contacted all of my friends and pulled together some muscle to help me with the move and then lined up a U-Haul. I had planned to go the next day (Monday), but in true Colorado fashion it decided to snow that day. I asked the seller if I could come Wednesday when the weather was supposed to be nice and warm and he agreed that he would sell to me on Wednesday - so now I have a confirmation that I was going to get the machine. I was still a bit worried that someone else would contact him and offer full price, but I was cautiously optimistic at this point. 

Wednesday came and it was a perfect day. The sun had returned and it was nice and warm out, melting away all of the snow. My friends got off from work and met at my place and we headed out to the seller's house. 

This guy had an amazing basement. He had a full bar, a nice home theater, a pool table, and of course the Star Wars cabinet as well as a stand up Galaga machine. The Star Wars cabinet was in great shape cosmetically. I tried out the machine and it worked like a charm. He gave me info on a local guy he used to do repairs a few years back and told me all of the things he did to maintain it. I wrapped the machine up to try and avoid damage and we started to muscle it up the stairs, which was incredibly hard. 

Here's one lesson learned - if you ever get a Star Wars cockpit and you need to go up or down stairs, take the wheels off of the bottom. You'll gain about an inch or so, and that can make all of the difference. We had to remove the wheels and even then we were getting stopped by a piece of molding on the overhang on his stairs. He ripped this down with a hammer and we were clear and able to get upstairs. 

After loading the cabinet onto the truck and getting it back to my place I was pretty sure the hardest point was behind me. We had four grown men and since we'd be going down into my basement gravity would be on our side. 

Of course nothing is that easy though. on the second to the last step we got hung up on the overhang on my stairs - but unlike his this wasn't just a molding I could pull down, this was part of the wall. No matter how much we jostled or pried we couldn't get past this obstruction - we were about an inch too tall even with the wheels off. So now a friend and I are pretty much trapped in the basement with the machine blocking any way out. We're exhausted at this point and the odds of lifting the machine back up the stairs is very low. With no other options I decided that my ceiling would have to make the ultimate sacrifice, so we took a reciprocating saw and cut away the obstruction, bracing ourselves at the bottom as we knew as soon as it was gone the full weight of the machine would be coming down on us. 

We finally got the machine down and situated. I removed the wrap and we cleaned all of the sawdust we had created off of the machine. Now was the moment of truth - had we damaged anything during the rough trip up and down the stairs? I plugged in the cabinet and was relieved to hear Obi Wan say ""The force will be with you"". Everything still worked fine!

I played the inaugural game and then my friends played a few games too. At this point it was after midnight and we'd been struggling with the move for about 6 hours, so we wrapped things up pretty quickly - we all had work the next day... but even with all the struggle, the torn up ceiling, high price tag and sore muscles... it was totally worth it. Every time I climb into that cockpit and blast some TIE fighters it brings me back to all those happy arcade memories from my youth.

1332908380.0,28,self.cade,rh285,Contacted the programmer from my favourite game (Hat Trick 1984) to try and get a copy of the unreleased sequel (Team Hat Trick) and got a reply![r/gaming x-post],LetMeSootheYou,31,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/rh285/contacted_the_programmer_from_my_favourite_game/,"During my degree my friends and I were drinking while testing out thousands of ROMs in MAME when suddenly we stumbled upon a game of pure competitive perfection. Hat Trick(1984) it was called. We started playing it and were blown away. Its a 1 vs 1 Ice Hockey game. The controls are simple, your joystick controls your player, and up and down on the same joystick controls your goalie and there is a shoot button for when you are in control of the puck. The game length is 1:45 with a 20 second overtime if the game is drawn.

Despite its simplicity this game never fails invoke empassioned crys and seat edge suspense during play. My friends and I years later still regularly get together and hold Hat Trick tournaments. Although it was released in 1984 (a year before most of us were born!) it is without a doubt our favourite two player game.

While browsing the net one day, to my delight, I discovered that a sequel **""Team Hat Trick""** was created that provided **2 vs 2** action which would allow teams to actually plan and impliment plays together with blocking and passing. I was elated! Unfortunately I went on to learn that Team Hat Trick never made it out of prototype and that only 21 machines were ever made, but more importantly noone has ever managed to get a copy of this ROM into the public domain.

However there was still hope! I thought if I contacted the original programmer he may have the source code and I may be able to build a ROM for MAME.

So I sent him an email, and this was his reply:

&gt;Hi LetMeSootheYou,
&gt; 
&gt;Team Hat Trick is the one game of mine I would most like to have a copy of.  Unfortunately, I never did get one, nor do I have the source code. I’m amazed that anyone even knows about Team Hat Trick.  As you know, Hat Trick did very well in the arcades, and was the #1 earner for several months in a row when it came out.  Even for that time period, the gameplay elements were very basic; I think the key to its success was getting just the right feel to the control of the player.  With the addition of strategic elements like passing, blocking, etc., I would say Team Hat Trick was 5x-10x more fun – and addictive.  We had a unit in the hallway outside my office, and 4 of us would play for an hour every day after lunch for many weeks -- much to the discomfort of others nearby, as the game encouraged a surprising amount of physical exertion, inevitably accompanied by increasingly louder cheering and even shouting.  I don’t remember why the game wasn’t produced; there was a unit on test in Canada which went through the roof, so it definitely wasn’t the fun factor.  It might have been the expense of producing a unique cabinet, or possibly had something to do with the financial trouble the company periodically found itself in.  Too bad in any case, as it was doubtless the most fun game I ever made.
&gt; 
&gt;Sorry I can’t help you.  Let me know if you find out anything elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt;-Lee


I was very excited to get a reply but I still don't have *Team Hat Trick*, but then again, maybe someone on reddit can help!

If anyone has any information about getting a copy of Team Hat Trick I would love to hear it and would be forever in your debt!

Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, Ms, Pac Man, Mr. Do, Mr. Do's Castle, and Pengo.

We sold them after a few years.  Now that I am a grown up, I collect and restore arcade games.  They are like little time capsules for me.  

4 years ago, I saw a craigslist ad for an ""QUARTERS VIDEO GAME"" on craigslist at a garage sale.  I went to the garage sale, and there it was.  A terribly converted Mr. Do.  They only wanted $75.  It worked fairly well, so I jumped on it.

Album here - http://imgur.com/a/wQmDo

Took it home with the intent of cleaning it up, fixing up the controls, and having an arcade in my garage. While I had the marquee out, I noticed it had a Scramble marquee underneath the Mr. Do sticker. I love Mr. Do, but I didn't love the cabinet it was in.  I decided to convert it back to a Scramble.

I actually had to cut off the last 4 or so inches of the cabinet off because it was so water damaged and chewed up. I stripped it of it's hardware and sent the metal parts off to be powder coated.  I stripped and sanded the cabinet of it's paint and patched up all of the blemishes with bondo. I rebuilt the bottom 5 inches of the cabinet.

Once the cabinet was rebuilt, I painted it yellow with some color codes I found online.  I ordered a stencil kit for it, and painted on the ""spaceman"" art.  I sold off the Mr. Do board and purchased a Scramble board, new control panel, and new T-Molding.

Bam.  Scramble.

This was the game that started my arcade game collecting bug.  I now have about 13 games in my basement as well as a few pinball machines.

Here is a wiring diagram I drew up before starting the project
[Wiring Diagram](http://s730.photobucket.com/albums/ww301/jcovercash/Pinball/?action=view&amp;current=wiring.jpg)



I used a LedWiz controller to take the ROM's output and control items such as: electrical contactors to simulate flipper/slingshot/bumper sounds, gear motor to emulate sounds from drawbriges/gates/doors etc found on pinball tables, RGB-W LEDs for external emulation of the lights and flashers, a 12V motor with offset weights for a shaker motor effect, and various other items. This machine gives you a lot of sound and feedback without the need to hook a speaker system up to it, however having that just adds to the experience too!

Redditor [/u/yatzr/](http://www.reddit.com/user/yatzr) deserves a huge thanks and some sort of medal for enduring the 5 hour round trip with me, through some pretty nasty thunderstorms, to secure this machine.  

We unloaded it around midnight last night, discovered all the manuals inside the cab and Yatzr used his Arcade Kungfu to determine 2 stuck microswitches were causing some control issues.  The cab is actually in great shape.  There are some scratches and a damaged corner at the bottom but other than that, its pretty good.

The guy I bought it from also had a non-working Robocop in a bit of a generic cabinet.  He also had a nintendo cabinet that had been converted to a NEO GEO with Metal Slug X.  Due to the bad weather, I had to take our van so I couldn't make it fit.  The monitor was a little flakey but I'd taken it if I had my truck.

Overall, I'm really excited.  Going to order all new microswitches and buttons today, just because and spend fathers day kicking ass with my kids.",,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,quarter,True,t3_1gecsa,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1gecsa/double_dragonis_mine/,

[Manual](http://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/O/Outrun%20Upright%20Parts%20Manual.pdf)

I've been hunting for a cab (or two) to do a restore on and teach myself more about these great icons from my childhood.  I've been searching for several months and just came across this Sega Out Run for $80.

I picked it up last night, and with the help of fellow redditor [Yatzer](http://www.reddit.com/user/yatzr) who I recently learned lived just 2 blocks down the street from me, we unloaded and started to try and resurrect this gem.

The previous owner said it was working fine and recently when he was playing the screen shut off and it started to hum.

The outside is pretty rough but nothing too serious.  Will need to be sanded and painted, and new side art applied.  The gas petal is pretty rusty but the Marque looks perfect and when I saw it light up, I got pretty giddy.

The cab powers on but it hums (I believe from the speakers) and you can hear some very faint squiggly voices on the speakers but it's just jibberish.  The marque and one of the coin slots lights up and there is a red light on the PCB that lights up as well.  

There is no video nor does the monitor appear to ""power on"".  The previous owner removed the original monitor b/c it didn't work right and sold that a while back on Craig's List for a $1 :( .  He replaced it with a smaller monitor that we are still trying to learn more about it.  It's a Mitsubishi something or another, I'll need to look closer this weekend.  I believe the original though was a 19"" Hantarex display.

We tried the test buttons but nothing happened.  We also dropped a few quarters in the coin slot but alas, no results.

Looking over the PCB it appears to be in good shape. I removed then reattached all the connectors and that didn't improve things. 

The bottom of the inside is a bit dirty and we thought perhaps the first item that needs attention is the power supply.  The manual for this cab (listed at the top) does a great job of detailing the somewhat intimidating layout of that area.  I'd like to go through this whole area and clean it up, maybe that will help or lead to more answers.

I've only had a few brief hours with it and just started my cursory hunt for more information.  It'd be great if there was an easy way for me to test these components but I may just need to get dirty and try and figure it all out.

I appreciate you all letting me share my excitement.",,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,quarter,True,t3_1fpa7z,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1fpa7z/i_finally_found_my_first_cab_sega_out_run/,

I think having the arcade will differentiate the bar and get it more business. Plus, I want to provide a place for people under 21 to hang out and have fun on the weekends (which this town is sorely lacking).  Oh, and I'm considering making it a pizza place too, if it works.

So what games are a must (classic and newer)?  What are good places to buy cabinets?  What are some good sites/tutorials to learn how to make MAME cabinets (I guess I'd have to look into the legality of those)?  Any other suggestions to make my barcade awesome?

There's a pretty strong fighter community in the area, so I'm sure to get some Street Fighters and Tekkens.

Original thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/mnihu/anyone_know_how_to_fix_these_glitchy_pies_in/).

I talked to a lot of people about this problem, cross-posting the issue to many different forums. There were a lot of opinions as to what was wrong:

* ""Looks like a sprite issue - clean your EPROMS""
* ""Your ROMs may just be bad, you might need to reprogram them""
* ""It looks like it's falsely generating a foreground object at those locations; and always a wrong vertical location (since the monitor is rotated). Check your foreground object RAMs at 6P / 6R, the preceeding ls157s on the address inputs, and the subsequent latches. Check the VF signals that looks like a vertical position counter""

I eventually was able to meet up with a local arcade hobbyist through the [KLOV forums](http://forums.arcade-museum.com/showthread.php?t=211031).  He had a DK machine himself, and encouraged me to bring my boards over to his place so we could troubleshoot my boards in his machine.  He had an oscilloscope, multimeter, schematics, and other tools for figuring out what was wrong.

At his house, though, we couldn't reproduce the problem! In his cabinet, my DK boards seemed 100% operational. This made us think the cause of the problem was not in the boards at all, and had to be somewhere else in my DK cabinet.

It ended up being something embarrassingly simple: I cleaned the cable connectors on the two cables running from my power supply to the CPU and video boards, and the problem is now fixed.

Glad to have a fully working game!  Love inexpensive fixes!

Rules First - (I hope this works right)
1.  This will be a first PM, first get, type of setup.  Meaning the first person that PM's me interest then they will get that part.  Mods, let me know if this will work or not.  I will be checking PM's each day at 10:00AM PST and 6:00PM PST.  
2.  You pay shipping for the part, plus USD $1.  My zip code is 85308, so you can base your shipping off of that.  All the parts are small enough that I can fit them in small boxes/shipping bags and the shipping size shouldn't cost much at all.
3.  I will ship out on Monday, whatever parts are ""taken""
4.  Paypal would be great and I will send paypal info in a PM response.  
5.  I can take pics if people would like them.

Parts Left Over -  All of these parts are in great/new shape/most are brand new.

**ragincajun88**  1.  Approx 15 Feet of Red T-Moulding (used on my project but still in great shape)

**brendanp** 2.  Approx 25 Feet of Black T-Moulding (BRAND NEW, never used or cut)

**penguinn** 3.  iPac 2 - USB Version (never used - brand new, Ordered by accident off ebay)

**Burn4Evr** 4.  iPac 4 - Older PS/2 version (comes with a PS/2 to USB cable and adapter.  Was used on an OLD (4 year old project then lost and then found again))

5.  3 brand new old style Donkey Kong buttons.  These style but all white: http://www.mikesarcade.com/cgi-bin/store.pl?sku=MDST-12-17 

6.  3 switches (never used, brand new)

7.  USB 2 Player Controller (This is it:  http://www.xin-mo.com/?page_id=34 ,  missing some wires )

8.  USB 2 Player Controller (same as number 7, missing some wires too)  

9.  Computer power supply.  I was going to use this as a power supply for my lights on the buttons but found plug in style transformer.

**simie**10. SEE NOTE2 BELOW:  Suzo/Happ 5v and 12v Power Supply.  5v and 12v from the same power supply, new never used AT ALL.

Game Discs:
Alright, this is the deal on the game discs!!   This would be great if it was a ""pay it forward"" type of deal.  Meaning, after you install the games and emulators, you post up a message and let someone else have a shot at getting them and installing.  Then the next person installs and posts up, so on and so forth.  But I really won't have any control after it leaves my hands.

**Those_anarchopunks**
1. Nintendo Handhelds Game Disc - Contains: Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance and Game Gear games and emulators

2.  Nintendo 64 Game Disc - Contains games and emulators

3.  MAME Disc - Contains some emulators and games (definitely not ALL the games but a number of them)

4.  Sega Game Disc - Contains emulator and games 

5.  Turbo 16 Graphix - Contains emulator and games

**brendanp**6.  Neo Geo and Capcom Game Disc - Contains emulators and games

7.  2 x Mugen Character and Game Discs - Contains games and a crap ton of Mugen characters.

That's it.  Just thought I would help out the community since I have stuff laying around.

**EDIT:**  Okay, sorry for the late update.  It was my son's 16th b-day over the weekend and I was completely engaged in all that mess and relatives, blah blah blah.   So here is the latest 

**NOTE1:**  The XIN-MO USB controller can also be found here: http://www.paradisearcadeshop.com/en/mame-arcade-parts/147-arcade-controller-to-usb.html

**NOTE2:**  I also found a BRAND NEW NEVER USED Suzo/Happ 5v and 12v power supply.  This was to be used for my lighting for my buttons but never used or even plugged in.  

1.  penguinn was the first to PM about the iPac2 
2.  Burn4Evr was the first to PM about the iPac4
3.  brendanp was the first to PM about the Black T-Moulding and the Neo Geo/Capcom Game disc
4.  ragincajun88 was the first to PM about the Red T-Moulding
5.  Those_anarchopunks was the first to PM about the remaining game discs.  He/she has stated that they will make them available again after they have loaded them all up.

It is actually a BARcade past 5pm, but I'm still 2 months shy of being 21, but once I am I will love to hang out there and have some drinks and such. Was recently re-opened so it feels brand spanking new, had classic 80's music which complimented the arcade vibe, and they had all of the best classic arcade as well as some of the newer 90's ones. No redemption game! (good thing) And upstairs were some additional arcades and all of their pinball machines. I didn't have time to document a whole lot, but I was able to get a picture of my measly attempt at a [Donkey Kong Score (2nd place woo!)](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/522465_10151462059702557_610760609_n.jpg) hahaha. Just felt so pumped about the place after I left that I decided to make a post about it! If you are ever in the Portland area, definitely check it out.

Also, this is what their [bathrooms](http://www.portlandactivitiesandevents.com/live/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Bathrooms.jpg) look like hahaha

, as you can see it's in a very very very bad shape, it's going to be a though job but it's fully working with an MVS system so that's good for now i guess.

it was previously on a movie theather so there's a lot of cleaning to do, the operator who gave ""service"" to the machines pretty much violated the cab, he changed the 100 yens slot to a random slot, changed the buttons for very crappy quality american style parts (that he soldered to the buttons instead of using quick connectors btw) so basically it's a huge mess, but i love it, i think this is the start of a long journey, i'll give updates when i have them, sorry again for my crappy english, it's not my main language. 

P.S. any info that you have on the astro city CP or the cab itself is very appreciated


EDIT: also i've decided not to turn it into a MAME cab like i said on my previous post, so don't worry guys

Feel free to share any experiences you may have had with the game or fun facts about it too.

So this weeks featured game is Double Dragon.

Double Dragon (ダブルドラゴン Daburu Doragon) is a 1987 beat 'em up developed by Technōs Japan and distributed in North America and Europe byTaito Corporation. The game is a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up, Nekketsu Kōha Kunio-kun (released outside of Japan by Taito as Renegade), but introduced several additions such as two-player cooperative gameplay and the ability to arm oneself with an enemy's weapon after disarming them. Double Dragon is considered to be one of the first successful examples of the genre, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat 'em ups.

I found an old DK cabinet marked down to 45 at a salvage warehouse. It was completly gutted so I decided to restore it to mostly original looks and MAME it. I went with a two player layout for multi-player fighter fun but my intention was for someone to walk up and assume it was a DK cabinet at first glance.

I finally completed the cutout ""properly"" to hold the retaining brackets for the marquee this past weekend, and thus wanted to share (been a long-time lurker on Reddit and this subreddit).

In short, I had three sheets of 3/4 plywood (from a prior project) and decided to create my own cabinet.  

**IMAGES are [here](http://imgur.com/a/PLZdN)**

At a high-level:

* Used [THIS](http://cosmicjive.net/arcade/super/plans.shtml) plan as a guide for the cabinet only

* Installed a Wells Gardner D9200 27in monitor for that realistic arcade action.  Review [here](http://retroblast.arcadecontrols.com/reviews/d9200-1.html).

* Decided that I didn't have time or tools to build the control panel, so broke down and bought a customized one from North Coast Custom Arcades - yeah it was expensive, but it just save me a bunch of headache in the long-run.

* Running a PC with MAME inside the cabinet, WinXp PRO with HyperSpin.


Am glad to share with you any questions you might have.  Was a fun project, challenging with the bondo/sanding/painting - not to mention, installing the beast of the CRT into the cabinet!

My hope in sharing is inspiring others to start from scratch with plywood, or provide some info that might help others if they purchase a used cabinet.

Thanks!

* [Tumblepop](http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10214) - Similar to bubble-bobble and snow bros. Lots of fun.

* [Joe &amp; Mac - Caveman Ninja](http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8235) - I think this went under a variety of names (and was ported to most consoles), but this is the one i knew it by.

There is one rule with this game though, at the end of every level [you have to beat your chest in time with the character doing his victory dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=ZyIpV527P5A&amp;t=100)

The sequel [elevator action returns](http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7702) is ok, but doesn't seem to recapture the same spirit; possibly because i've only played it in MAME and never got to play it in the arcade as a kid like the original.

* [Bank panic](http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7012) - A fun game based mostly on reaction speed. The controls are simple even for people who don't game much. Great for when you've got buddies around and had a few drinks...

There are some recent pictures, along with a few pictures from various points during the build process [in my most recent blog entry](http://blog.patshead.com/2013/01/cocktail-arcade-cabinet-upgrade-part-3---the-conclusion.html?r=reddit).  The TV add on is 32"" and 1080p.

Here's the important specs:

 * Four players with 6 buttons each (one is always against the wall here, though)
 * 24 inch 1080p LCD
 * Athlon X2 3800
 * NVidia GT 240
 * I-PAC 4
 * HAPP buttons and joysticks
 * Linux

There are more pictures of the completed cabinet on [the final entry in my long winded series](http://blog.patshead.com/2011/01/cocktail-arcade-cabinet-build-part-10---the-finished-cabinet.html?r=reddit).  There are some pretty good pictures of the guts on [the second to last entry in the series](http://blog.patshead.com/2010/12/cocktail-arcade-cabinet-build-part-9---the-computer-hardware-and-software.html?r=reddit).

I wrote quite a lot of words regarding the build, and there are pictures at nearly every step.  If you're interested enough, you can [start at the very beginning](http://blog.patshead.com/2010/09/the-beginning-of-an-arcade-cocktail-cabinet-build.html?r=reddit).

Here's the tl;dr summary of the design.  We built the shell out of 5/8"" particle board.  All the parts are cut to be slotted together, so it is quite sturdy.  Most of the cabinet is covered in textured, sticky-back vinyl, and we covered up the edges with a light blue t-molding.  The control panel surfaces, and the surrounding areas are covered in ""blackened"" plexiglas.  They look a lot like the control panels in ST:TNG.

We wanted it to be tall enough for actual adults, and we wanted to have enough leg/foot clearance for adult sized feet.  It is a little taller than it should be; I wish we'd have left about 2"" less clearance between the control panels and the tabletop.

I'm emulating all the usual, expected systems, but I don't really play those very often.  I spend more time playing newer indie games.  Games like Super Meat Boy, Braid, Cave Story, or rRootage.  I'm also now about 3/4 through [Rico - A Tale of Two Brothers](http://www.imake-games.com/rico-a-tale-of-two-brothers/).  

I've started slowly updating [a list of games I have running on the cabinet](http://blog.patshead.com/2012/10/cocktail-arcade-cabinet-software-emulators-and-computer-specs.html?r=reddit), if anyone is interested.

I'm actually really pleased with the addition of the extra display.  It makes it more comfortable to play and it reminds me of when I was small enough that I had to sit on a stool to play games in real arcades.

I'm very proud of the work we did on this cabinet, and I could talk about it all day.  I'd be more than happy to answer any questions about the build!",,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,,True,t3_182btb,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/182btb/i_recently_connected_a_wall_mounted_lcd_tv_to_my/,

We're nearly at 3,000 users and I just want to say thank you to everyone who posts, comments and upvotes for making this an awesome community.

------------------------------------


**FLAIR**

I enabled text flair!  Simply make sure the checkbox for ""Show my flair on this reddit"" is checked in the right sidebar.  Then click edit and you can type your own flair for now.  In addition to the text flair, I'd like to add icon / image type flair!

------------------------------------

**So let's have a contest!!!!!**

Create and choose image flair for /r/cade!  The rules:

1. All flair must be exactly 20x20 pixels.  No exceptions.
1. All flair must be in PNG format.
1. All flair must relate to this subreddit.  Meaning, Arcade culture, Mame, Arcade games of any date, /r/cade specific, etc.
1.  Get as creative as you want.  Either make your own or hunt down images from the internet.  Remember, they must fit the specs above.
1. Submissions should be a comment in this post.  You may submit as many times as you want.  You may group submissions just as I have below in the examples.
1. Each submission needs to be a link to the PNG file with the title as the link text.  (see examples below)
1. I reserve the right to veto any submission if I feel that it doesn't ""fit"" /r/cade, is of poor quality or if it's in anyway obscene or offensive.  Use common sense when submitting.  ;)
1. Contest ends Jan 25 2013.  I'll stop accepting / considering flair at the end of the day and work on getting them in the following week.
1. If your flair is chosen, your submission will be added to the master flair list.  This means anyone and everyone in /r/cade will get to sport your flair.

In [the original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/m0lk3/anyone_know_how_to_fix_this_donkey_kong_color/) it was suggested that it might be a degaussing problem.

I had a hard time believing this was due to degaussing because the pattern of incorrect colors was too exact. Also, none of the sprites (mario, barrels, fireballs, pies, donkey kong) were the wrong colors -- only the background stationary objects were wrong. If it was a degaussing problem, I would think that mario would change colors when I moved him into the area that needed degaussing, but his colors always remained true.

[You can view the color patterns in this album.](http://imgur.com/a/2y5CY)

This made me believe that maybe it was a board issue. Some online research led me to [this website](http://www.brasington.org/arcade/tech/dk/) that had many MAME examples of color problems and the corresponding chips on the board.

My cocktail is the 4-board set, so I located the ""2K and 2J"" chips on my CPU board. [Pic here](http://imgur.com/JPckp).

They're socketed, so I could pull them out using a small flathead screwdriver to inspect and clean the contacts.

At first, it [got worse](http://imgur.com/CtlBu) before it got better. I accidentally didn't press the cleaned chips back into the socket hard enough.

But even after reinstalling 2K and 2J (""Color Maps""), there was no change from the original image problem.

I then moved on to removing and cleaning 5H and 5K (""Fixed Characters"") on the VIDEO board. Again, [it got worse](http://imgur.com/YE4FT) before it got better. You must be really careful when reinserting the chips into the socket that the pins line up with the contacts properly.

Finally, I located 5F (""Character Colors""). I got excited when I saw it in the board because the contacts looked really dirty and gummy.

[I removed it, cleaned the contacts with a small wire brush attachment I have from my Dremel set, and replaced it with high hopes.](http://imgur.com/a/OJ3NW)

The verdict?  [SUCCESS!](http://imgur.com/InBSf)

I suppose that when I dragged my cabinet from one side of the room to the other, the gummy 5F chip lost whatever poor contact it had with the board, and caused the color problem. Quick cleaning and it's good as new, no soldering required!",,False,self,t5_2snqq,True,,,True,t3_m8ttj,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/m8ttj/updatefixed_anyone_know_how_to_fix_this_donkey/,

-The monitor is a hi-res makvision 27"" crt

-The encoder used is an Ipac-4.

-LED's are driven by a LEDWiz pcb

-The trackball is a 3"" happ trackball with groovygamegear's 
electric ice rgb upgrade kit.

-The spinner is a slikstik tornado by happ

-There are dual lightguns made by ultimarc that run on their aimtrak system.

-The rest of the buttons and sticks were ordered from lizard lick amusements.

-Artwork was ordered through Game on Grafix. (Minus the zombie target)

-Coin door was a Christmas gift one year off an old cab.

-Speakers are M-Audio AV40's

PC:

-WinXP

-Maximus Arcade frontend

-AMD X2 5200+

-Radeon HD 4670

I'd also like to include the reason for the name of my cab. Laser Illusions was my FAVORITE arcade as a youth. Sadly it no longer exists. It was located in our local mall and featured space-like themes. Imagine grated flooring and hot pink and blue florescents beneath.

Bonus points to those who own a real dedicated cab or pcb board of this weeks featured game, please post pics of it! I am sure r/cade would love to see them. If you don't have a cab then Mame is cool to use too. Please lets not turn this post into a place on where to find roms. Feel free to share any experiences you may have had with the game or fun facts about it too.

So this weeks featured game is Metal Slug.

Metal Slug (メタルスラッグ Metaru Suraggu) is a run and gun video game developed by Nazca Corporation and published by SNK. It was originally released in 1996 for the Neo-Geo MVS arcade platform. The game is widely known for its sense of humor, fluid hand-drawn animation, and fast paced two-player action. It is the first title in the Metal Slug series. 

The evil General Morden and his rebel army has launched a coup d'état on the world's governments, and all attempts by the armies of the various countries to curtail his growing power fail. His most recent attack has given him access to a new form of all-terrain combat tank dubbed ""Metal Slug"". In a last effort to stop Morden, Marco Rossi and Tarma Roving of the Peregrine Falcon Squad are sent to locate and eliminate his powerbase, as well as reclaim or destroy any Metal Slugs they can find so as to keep the technology out of Morden's hands.

I wanted to create the arcade experience in my garage, but I wasn't about to make an entire cabinet. So with some items I had lying around I created the Cantilevered Cade. I love mounting stuff and almost all of my screens (TVs/Monitors) I have around the house are mounted to the wall whether they would benefit from it or not. I also love playing NBA Jam, thus the reason for the basketball theme. The only items I purchased for this project were the TV and the TV Mount, everything else was just collecting dust in my house. 

Sorry for the blurrycam images, I was taking shots with my old iPhone 3G with bad lighting. I had a picture of NBA Jam running on the machine, but for some reason it was erased and didn't make the album. Overall, I like how the project came out. It works well and we've already used the machine to throw a Karaoke party. I just need to invite the guys over to have an arcade tournament.

Reply to: gcfxj-3068204926@sale.craigslist.org [Errors when replying to ads?]

Up for sale is a one of a kind piece of art. You may wonder how a 50 dollar pinball machine with 40 dollars worth of lights is suddenly worth 100k, i'll tell you, its art! And art is worth whatever someone chooses it to be worth. I arrived at 100k using this formula, $50 + $40 + thousands of hours of work. What took thousands of hours? Well to the layman's eye it might look like i just painted it with some black spray paint. However i actually used a stipple technique which consists of making millions of small dots with a single horsehair and since the pinball machine's original color was yellow, this took several applications to get the overall solid black appearance. Then since 1978 particle board isn't very sturdy i reenforced the edges with 2x4's i had around laying around my house. Now if you are some rich fat cat art connoisseur and think you can swoop in and offer me a paltry 10k or something i will be forced to laugh in your face! And then we can discuss where and when is a good time to meet, i can deliver in a 14,500 mile area. In the future when hanging pinball wall art is all the rage, a mere 100k would be a steal. Its like getting Picasso's first coloring book for 10 bucks. NO LOWBALLERS. If serious and really rich, please put in the subject line ""I have a briefcase full of money for you, please take it"". Thanks for looking.

They're in pretty good condition but don't function.

The **Galaxian** turns on but there the screen is just a blue line down the center. 

**UPDATE** FIXED!!! One of the riser boards on the CRT pcb was loose. Thanks for the catch /u/darthphunk

--------------------

The **Pole Position** doesn't turn on at all, but may be because of a loose cable that I haven't found a place to plug in. I will update accordingly. 

**UPDATE2** decided I'm joing to mame the pole position. I heard PP1 and PP2 are terribly made machines and just rarely work at all.
 
**UPDATE** The molex on the wall plug that goes into the PSU was disconnected, but even after connecting it still refuses to turn on after flipping the switch in the back. 
I did notice that one of the fuses are missing and even more so a wire is just kind of chilling in the open looking kind of split. Its attached but it looks like it might belong to a fuse.

----------------------------
Note that the Game pcb in both machines look to be intact. I think its either a matter of wiring (looks like mice might've been free in it) or the psu.

If anyone has experience with this, please help a newb out. If the repairs are either too annoying or too costly, I'll just MAME them. **But the focus is on the Galaxian because I want to fix it for father's day.**

So this weeks featured game is U.N. Squadron

U.N. Squadron is a 1989 side scrolling shooting game released for the CPS arcade hardware by Capcom. The game was released in Japan as Area 88(Japanese: エリア88 Hepburn: Eria Hachi-Jū-Hachi) and is based on the manga series of the same name, featuring the same main characters. Here, their mission is to stop a terrorist group known as Project 4. It was followed by the sequel Carrier Air Wing.

The game is a typical side scrolling shooter, going against the trend of other Capcom shooters, such as 1942, and 1943: The Battle of Midway, which are vertically scrolling shooters. However, like other Capcom shooters, the player has a life / energy bar that is consumed over the course of a single life as the player sustains damage, a trait highly uncommon among other comparable arcade-style shooters which normally use a system of reserve lives, where one of which is lost upon a single enemy hit. Before entering a level, the player has the opportunity to purchase special weapons or added defenses in the shop. The player earns money to buy weapons by destroying enemy planes and vehicles during levels and, when the level is finished, any unused weapons are converted back into money.
The player can choose between three mercenary pilots: Shin Kazama, Mickey Simon, and Greg Gates. Each pilot flies a specific plane and has slightly different capabilities.

One cabinet is an old Double Dragon machine that I was told that I need a new JAMMA board and a new power cord.  I got these for basically nothing except moving them and the time to transport.

Here are the pictures of the Double Dragon: http://imgur.com/a/kBRC1

I was wondering if there was a tutorial or a guide, checklist, etc on the first things to do when trying to clean it up and assess the cabinet.

I know it's very old and shouldn't look brand new, but it's looking really rough and I'm not sure what to do with it or where to start.  I have the time and I'm very eager to learn though.

I also got an Atari War: Final Assault cabinet (pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/F2XLA).

I know that I can replace the t-molding and I'll get that done.  The monitor seems to take a few minutes to get to a bright lighting, but other than that - everything works great.  I want to make sure that it's working OK, nothing needs to be fixed, repaired or have it be a ticking time bomb til something breaks.  The people I got this from hadn't used them in a few years and I'm looking at these as you would with buying a used car.  I want to make sure that I get all of the ""maintenance"" work done.

Is there anything I can do to verify that it's working 100% and give it some type of inspection in case I ever sell it? I'd want to disclose everything, but want to make sure that it's OK to sell down the road, if needed.  I'm so concerned with what the previous owners over the last 10-20 years did to these - I want to make sure they're OK.

Basically - what tools do I need, how should I start to clean/inspect the cabinets and where is the ""manual"" for new people who want to get into this hobby?

Thanks everyone!

So, while the marquee will be done specifically for the commercial and swapped down the road, I'd like to have a control panel overlay that works for both the commercial and my own use.

Coming up with a good design would be easier if I had a unifying theme, but I'm trying to keep the control panel as generic as possible so it will work not only for the commercial, but for any game I throw at it.  Right now I'm using a ""red vs blue"" grid design, and I'm pretty satisfied with it as far as the control panel area itself, but I have no idea what to do for the front part (light blue rectangle in the pic I uploaded).  I've tried several generic patterns, but every one is just begging for some text or artwork in the center, and without a name or theme, I have no idea what to do with this space...

There is enough room under the CP for a PC and the CP itself is the only part made of wood, everything else is metal.
I think I am going to make a new top for the CP and do 4 players+trackball, the bezel is plastic and I might have to make a new one to fit an LCD. The back I don't know what I can do, maybe storage, it can be removed, I think, as long as the CD is not too heavy.
I need to decide if I should paint it or just wrap it in vinyl, I already clean it up pretty good and tomorrow I will hammer out a few dents here and there.

Hi, and welcome to my listing for Street Fighter Champion Addition Video Arcade Game machine.

This machine came out of the back room of a pub following a recent pub clearance I recently did, so I dont know much about this machine. I have many more machines, so please check my other listings.

Out of the other machines I got, this is definately one of the more retro machines. I have tried booting it up. I am no electrician, but I can hear the monitor trying to start up, and there is a little red light flashing on the circuit board. Other than that I do not want to get involved in the electrics. (The terminals look very rusty &amp; there is a lot of dust which comes free with this machine!) This machine is sold as seen and untested. It could be an easy fix, but just not my trade.

As you can see from the pics, it is a 2 player game, with 2 joysticks and 6 red buttons either side with a 1 and 2 player feature button. The coin slots are there. Unfortuantely it is missing the bottom panel. I have found the back panel which will go on the machine. The locks are all in open poistion but I do not have any keys.

The paint work, decor and wood work all seem to be in very good condition. There are a few chips on the woodwork at the bottom which are hardly noticeable for such a classic retro machine. This machine does have 2 wheels on the back so can be very easily manovured.

I'm hoping it's just something wrong with the wiring and I can get it all up and running

Possibly Italian/European?,CynepMeH,14,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1hrzel/please_help_id_arcade_game_from_my_childhood/,"**EDIT: FOUND IT!!! It's Xain'd Sleena! Thanks to arcade-museum vast library and bit of googling, I found it!!!**

Long story short: Back in my early teens in 1989, I lived in Italy for few months. I wasted a small fortune at an arcade shooter game. I can't remember it's name for the life of me, despite playing it for who knows how many times. I do remember it being right next to Robocop arcade, though =)

The game started out by ship flying graphics and then it hovered in on the left side of the screen. A spaceman in white space suit dropped out of the space ship. Game action was running/jumping/shooting, moving from left to right (think kind of like Contra in space), shooting at stuff. 

If you made it past 2nd level (if I recall correctly), you got into a space ship and it became a flying space shooter. Same horizontal movement from left to right while flying the spaceship. On subsequent levels you would be dropped back to run around as spacemen again. I don't believe I made it past level 4, so I can't comment about other specifics. 

Other thoughts:

You could move up/down/back/forward but game kept moving - you couldn't stay in one spot. Also, the background was rocky terrain against black star-dotted sky, if this helps. 

sorry it's so obscure - last time I played it was 1989, so my memories are bit rusty...

Bonus points to those who own a real dedicated cab or pcb board of this weeks featured game, please post pics of it! I am sure r/cade would love to see them. If you don't have a cab then Mame is cool to use too. Please lets not turn this post into a place on where to find roms. Feel free to share any experiences you may have had with the game or fun facts about it too.

So this weeks featured game is Prehistoric Isle 2

Prehistoric Isle 2 is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up in which armed with your attack helicopter you must shoot down hordes of dinosaurs both in the air and on land. You are tasked with rescuing civilians from the rampaging dinosaurs and at various points in the game are instructed to 'Defend People' adopting a defensive role whilst any survivors in that area are picked up by a rescue helicopter. 

Prehistoric Isle 2 has something to tickle shoot 'em up fans . Directed by Yumekobo, the virtuosos who gave birth to Blazing Star the year before, the game was born with quite a pedigree. It is also the sequel of an excellent title released in 1989 by SNK, Prehistoric Isle. If the fact of killing dinosaurs rather than ships or aircraft may call, we can not deny that the concept is original. The game sports a pre-rendered CG look that is unique for the Neo-Geo MVS. This is one of the more overlooked shmups for its time on the MVS. 

There's a choice of two different helicopters each with their own different firing patterns and bomb attacks. The blue helicopter has a slightly faster speed. Your main weapon can be enhanced in two different ways by collecting power-ups of either C or G type and up to a maximum of level 5. Various types of missile power-ups can also be picked up to boost your firepower. Normally you can only take one hit before losing a life but it's also possible to play with a life gauge if you are using a certain bios. Collecting the stars which appear is essential to achieving a high score.

I've been preparing for putting together my control board and I bought some parts from Paradise Arcade and Ultimarc.  It occurs to me now that I have no idea what I'm doing.  Here is a visual representation of what I'm dealing with:

http://i.imgur.com/D9LFJ.jpg

I guess I suck with wiring.  Here are more details on the questions asked in the above picture..

A. How do I get these lines to insert into this connector?  I guess what's the appropriate way to use one of those connectors?  

B. I just guessed on this, not sure how to know which goes where.  I spoke to the owner at Paradise Arcade and he said for a PacLED64, I need to use the outside 4 pins because I don't need a resistor with PacLED64.  Most of that went over my head, but I believe him.  However, I can put it on two ways on that set of pin.  I just assumed the white line goes where there isn't a little chip next to the pins.  This is probably a more appropriate question for Paradise Arcade but just thought I'd try my luck here first.

C. Do I need to strip these connectors off in favor of another connector like on ""A""?  Paradise Arcade assured me this is the wiring harness I need, but it doesn't plug into the PacLED64 as is.  Should I just remove the end connector thingies and do the same thing as in ""A"", assuming I learn how to do that correctly?

Thanks for any assistance.  This is just to try out two lighting solutions and determine which one I like best.  I have two of Paradise Arcade's milky white ""Hoku"" IL Pushbuttons.

I'm looking to build a few of these (http://www.flickr.com/photos/donovanmyers/sets/72157615957035070/) using plans from Donovan Meyers (http://www.donovanmyers.com/) but I plan on using them for retail use in a game room I'm looking to open. 

I decided on building cabs instead of buying full cabs for a few reasons. Firstly I think they will be cheaper in the long run, I wont have to worry about monitors dying. I can control what is in the cab and how its wired so there wont be any surprises when I fix issues. Another reason is that I’d like to fit as many games as I can in a small area, which is why I went with the Vewlix sit down style.My main question is what would be the easiest way to get a real arcade boards, JAMMA harness, Kick harness, and other miscellaneous things like coin switches and such hooked up to one of these? 

Also, if anyone can think of a good way to have a coin slot in those plans that would be great. I'm still debating on if I will use coins, cards, or do one of those $5 to get in the door everything is on free play sort of deals. I'd prefer to use quarters though.

So this weeks featured game is Final Fight.

Final Fight (ファイナルファイト) Jessica, the daughter of the city Mayor Mike Haggar has been kidnapped by the evil 'Mad Gear' gang. Set in the fictional Metro City, Haggar rounds up two of his closest friends, Guy and Cody, and sets out to battle Mad Gear's gang members and ultimately rescue his daughter.

1 or 2 players choose to play as either Guy, Cody or Haggar in this superb, sideways scrolling beat-em-up. As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in certain crates and barrels. Some of the Mad Gear gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players.

After the benchmark-setting ""Double Dragon"", released by Technos in 1987, Final Fight would become the standard-bearer of the scrolling beat-em-up genre. Featuring a large variety of distinctive, well animated characters moving through colorful and detailed backgrounds, and with a control system that is as intuitive as it is complex, Final Fight is still considered to be the finest example of its kind.
Final Fight began development as a sequel to the original Street Fighter released in 1987, but the genre was switched from a fighting game to a beat 'em up and the title was changed following the success of Double Dragon. The Final Fight development team later worked on the   Fighter II and some of the characters from Final Fight later appeared as playable fighters in other entries of the franchise such as the Street Fighter Alpha sub-series.

So this weeks featured game is **Lethal Enforcers**.

Lethal Enforcers (リーサルエンフォーサーズ Rīsaru Enfōsāzu) is a 1992 shooting game released for the arcades by Konami. The in-game graphics consist entirely of digitized photographs. This caused controversy as it allowed players to shoot photorealistic representations of enemies.
Initially armed with a standard-issue service revolver, the player can acquire upgraded weapons during the course of play: a Magnum Gun, a Semi-automatic pistol, a shotgun, or an assault rifle. When the player loses a life, his weapon reverts to the basic service revolver.

Enemies always wear sunglasses, ski masks or gas masks, while fellow police officers and innocent bystanders are always barefaced.

The Japanese arcade version of Lethal Enforcers contain several differences which aren't in the US and European arcade versions. These differences include the ""how to reload"" animation (in the US and Euro versions, it features an animation which shows a woman shooting outside of the cabinet's screen to reload in-game, while the Japanese version features an animation which features the default revolver and how to reload it), and an additional taunt which some criminals shout ""Die, pigs!"" to the player in the Japanese version, but was removed from the US and Euro versions as the use of the word ""pig"" is considered a highly insulting derogatory term that describes a police officer

So this weeks featured game is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.


Developed by Sega (programming) and Triumph International (audiovisuals), with the help of Jackson which was released on the Sega System 18 hardware. This game suffered from Sega's suicide battery on its arcade board (a battery that, accidentally or otherwise, renders the game unplayable at the end of its lifespan). The arcade has distinctively different gameplay from its computer and console counterparts, focusing more on beat 'em up gameplay elements rather than platform.The game is essentially a beat-em-up, although Jackson attacks with magic powers instead of physical contact, and has the ability to shoot magic power at enemies instead of getting close enough for a melee attack. A map of the stage is shown before it begins, and after which, Jackson must get from the start to the end without losing all his health, rescuing all the children and defeating all the enemies along the way.


The game can also be played multiplayer if the cabinet supports it, up to three people can play simultaneously. All three players play as Jackson, dressed in his suit from the ""Smooth Criminal"" music video. The first player wears a white suit and hat, with a blue shirt; the second player's character dons a scarlet outfit with a white shirt; the third player's character is dressed in black, with a red shirt. The characters all have armbands: blue for white outfit, white for red outfit, and red for black outfit.

As I have never done anything like this before I started with concept and a [shopping list](http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/nw44o/shopping_list_for_a_control_panel_electronics/). From this I built a [test setup](http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/p8th5/test_layout/). From this test system I decide what button layout I preferred and that I should add a spinner. 

The top panel art is laminated MDF. I used the gimp to design my own graphics. A copy is [here](http://i.imgur.com/wVclDh.jpg). I rear mounted the joysticks.

The power, coin, and flipper (side) buttons all have coloured LEDS that play in patterns and respond to game signals. This is done via a python script I wrote to listen to control the keyboard LEDS which are available for lights via the I-PAC. My script allows a programmable attract mode. In addition it monitors Mame's output for game that support it.

A question. At some point I'd like to have multiple boards, or consoles inside my JAMMA cabinet, and have the ability to select between them via a switch inside the front service panel. What I have in mind currently, is to use an old manual printer port switcher, to toggle certain signals between the various boards. Perhaps run the power lines through the switcher, if it can handle that. So I'd have all the devices hooked up to the cabinet's main JAMMA connector at once, with just enough side tracked through the switch to allow me to toggle between them easily.

Has anyone tried such a setup? Any tips/suggestions?

I’m planning on the arcade monitor-IPAC-PC set up.  (May use a modded Xbox in place of PC if I can.)


Cabinet came with speakers, marquee light, and power supply, but as they have older arcade wiring, I was originally going to gut all of these and start with an empty shell.  

As a n00b, I am probably missing some easy opportunities.  Any recommendations on if I should use the following?

* HAPP Power Pro power supply.

* 2 speakers installed below marquee.  Additional speaker near coin door.

* Male 3 prong outlet in back (like what you see on back of PC) with an I/O switch.  Right now it leads to a sea of black/green wires.  Looks like an opportunity to make a simple on/off button for the unit.

* Marquee fluorescent light with loose wire ends.  (I was thinking to just wire it back to a lamp cord and plug into power strip with the computer.)

After looking at all the different types of layouts, designs, and final products, I think that a pedestal-type of cabinet would be best for us. This is going to be a two man project, and neither of us have any woodworking/carpentry experience at all. The only things we have going for us right now is that I've wanted a cabinet my whole life, and a decent amount of money that I've saved up. Being completely new to building a home arcade, I was hoping you guys could help me out with plans/suggestions/ideas, or anything else you guys might think is helpful!

http://forum.beoworld.org/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.PostAttachments/00.00.31.85.24/Beomame.jpg

I think that this is how I envision the final product, although a bit less flashy and less lights, just so you guys get the angle I'm going for. Another thing is that I definitely want to make a four player cab so that when friends come over, we can all enjoy some nostalgia.

Right now, I have a desktop PC from 2007 (Intel Core2Duo 1.7ghz proc), so it's decent but not great. I also have access to an old original xbox which I've heard can be good for running games if modded. I'll also be using a 32' LCD tv mounted on the wall. Here are some things that I hope I can get some help with:

Where should I seriously start? My roommate and I have plans in our heads, but nothing down on paper just yet. 

Building materials/necessary tools? Cost?

Control Panel/buttons/joysticks? I've heard good things about lizardlick and focusattack; any other recommendations? Would something like this http://www.mameroom.com/Products_Quad_Kit.asp be worthwhile since we have no experience?

Should I use the PC or the xbox? 

Frontend recommendations? 

And anything else you guys have to offer such as tips or advice would be greatly appreciated! I want to get this project off the ground sometime soon and every little bit from you guys would really help us out for our first venture into building a cab

I don't care about dupes or clones, it's easier to remove them than add them. By this point I have like 5 or 6 shit ""Xml builders"" that always either spit out a junk file or spit out a syntax-error-ridden junk file. Internet searching leads to references to programs that no longer exist because the creator vanished or the sole hosting place went bust, or to empty XML files or files that SAY they're complete but are the same as the incomplete ones.

If anyone can either build one for me or point me in the direction of a program that will most certainly work (at this point I've tried 3 versions of HyperROM2XML which lead to incorrectly formatted files, Dir2XML which leads to junk, and Hyperspintools which can't create a list itself and won't read anything from the tools above) I would really, really appreciate it, because half of the games I want to play are Japanese and inaccessible from Hyperspin currently.

I FOUND IT! I found something that could help me create what I needed. It was an alpha release of a proof-of-concept ROM manager called HyperspinChecker.

See the reds on the score board, the ""win a game"" text, and players shirts?

There's only the faintest hint of that on my cabinet...

[Example 1](http://i.imgur.com/i5XNS1p.jpg)

I tried cranking the red drive up all the way and adjusted the red-cut off to allow the most amount of red ,and I got a red hue, but no actual red. You can only faintly see it if you have the contrast/brightness up all the way

[Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/UTLTo15.jpg)

Any ideas? 

The other issue is that when you select 2 players, every time the second player is activated... The screen flips upside and controls become in-operable... !??!?! it's bizarre! Actually thinking about it now... I wonder if it's in table top vs stand up mode... I remember a dip for that in the manual... brb!!!

Having some problems with Hyperspin and other things,iamnaeth,8,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/17vbei/trying_to_put_the_finishing_touches_on_my_long/,"Hey guys n gals.  Over the next month or so I'm trying to finally get my arcade up and running smoothly.  About a year ago I got hyperspin and a ton of emulators up and running.  Not all running smoothly, but well enough that I could have a few people over to play the arcade with some babysitting.  I had people over for the SB yesterday and I spent more time that I wanted getting the front end and games working well together so I thought I'd ask you guys a few simple questions.  I'm sure more will come over the next couple weeks but here are the first few.


1.  For some reason, when playing arcade games using Mame, the game will alt-tab back to the hyperspin front end leaving the game playing in the back ground.  No combination of my P1 and P2 controls are alt-tab.  They're all just regular keyboard letters.  I have no clue what's going on here. It's not consistent, it seems random but my guess is the FE is pulling focus back somehow.

2. My Nintendo emulator, Nestopia, will launch, then go back to hyperspin.  When I launch a second time, it keeps focus on the game but then I have two instances of the game running.

3. All my letters for quick jumping do not show up on my wheel.  For example, I have B, C, but no A.  Q,S,T but no R.

4. Not hyperspin related but I can't figure this one out on Mame.  For games that use a spinner or trackball.  Let's say arkanoid.  How can I make my spinner control the paddle?  It says Mouse X but still isn't moving the paddle.

Let's start with that. Thanks so much in advance for any help you can provide!",,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,,True,t3_17vbei,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/17vbei/trying_to_put_the_finishing_touches_on_my_long/,

Hi all!

I'm planning on building my first machine soon.

My original plan was for all the admin buttons, then:
8-way stick, 6 buttons, trackball, 8-way stick, 6 buttons, trackball.

It was pointed out that with that much squished onto one panel it either wouldn't fit, or there wouldn't be room to use the trackballs without karate chopping the sticks.  Also, old games like Pacman, Galaga, and Donkey Kong are not as responsive with 8-way sticks.

Here's my new plan, in full mspaint glory:
http://i.imgur.com/yW1tz.png
You can probably guess what my last name is from that pic...

As you can see, I've pulled out the two trackballs and subbed in one 4-way stick, 2 button combo for oldschool games.  I'll make it modular so I can swap out all the sticks for my two trackballs (I realize that marble madness is the only good 2 trackball game, but I love it).  As soon as I can get a good deal on a second screen and comp, I will build my second arcade.  The second one will have my liquor cabinet inside instead of a bar fridge.

The main reason for this post is to get your advice on what parts I should order and from whom.  Exactly which product ID's and from what website?  I live in canada, but so far most sites I've been to ship there.  I plan on making the order on Cyber Monday in hopes of discounts.

I'll keep you all updated with progress reports.  OP will surely deliver.

thanks!

My end goal is to have a MAME setup, preferably with four-players.  Here it is in its current state (except I've done some touch-up paint):

http://i.imgur.com/Q3M4s.jpg

I'll be applying some black matte formica laminate on the sides soon, but I need to start thinking about the control deck.  This was previously an NFL Blitz machine, so the deck box it came with is slightly bigger to fit four player.  However the existing controls only have a joystick and three buttons per player.  If I gave any more than that, things are going to start getting cramped if I have four players standing there.

First question, anyone out there have a four-player cabinet?  Was it worth it?

Second, whats a good button layout, anyway?  I've seen several different layouts, some with 7 buttons, some with 8 buttons, some straight, some curved.  What's the pros and cons of each?

Third, if I do go the four player route, could I get away with giving players 1 and 2 seven buttons and players 3 and 4 four buttons?  My understanding is that many four player games don't use as many buttons.

I don't have a whole lot of woodworking experience so I feel it would be rather difficult to build a new box myself to make a bigger deck, unless someone has a simple guide or suggestion for it to not be overly difficult.

Oh, one more question... what's the general consensus on 4-way, 8-way, and the joysticks that can easily switch between the two?  Particularly for MAME/console emulation.

Unfortunately, the original electronics were ruined, so I'm going the less expensive route and putting a MAME PC into the cabinet.

I'd like the Tron machine to be *mostly* dedicated to Tron, but as long as it's running an emulator, I figure I might as well put a front-end in and let players choose from a small selection of arcade games that play well on this particular hardware.

I've made this mock-up of the modifications I plan to make to the control panel: http://i.imgur.com/9qzXG.jpg

If I add a dedicated ""start"" button to the cp, then I can map the big start buttons as gameplay buttons for other games (I'm also replacing the old leaf buttons with HAPPS competition buttons--I like the click).  This way you can play Arkanoid without messing with the trigger stick, and you have enough action buttons on the CP to play Tempest.

So I need to think about what games use a vertical (portrait) monitor orientation and can be played with a (barely) 8-way trigger stick, two buttons, and a spinner. Here's what I've come up with so far:

* Tron (duh)
* Arkanoid
* Tempest
* Dig Dug
* Pac Man/Ms Pac Man
* Frogger
* 1942/1943
* Xevious
* Zaxxon
* Galaga/Galaxian

There are a few others that I think would sort-of work, like you could play Gun.Smoke, but using the trigger plus two other buttons seems awkward, plus the Tron stick doesn't really like to go diagonally. Games that require you to push diagonally to shoot diagonally like Contra or Commando would be more difficult.

(Newbie),ChurKirby,13,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1jybsm/building_a_jamma_cabinet_newbie/,"A bit of backstory: I'm someone with no experience of owning or building an arcade machine before. I've had a small dream of owning one for a while, but I'm only 19 and still living with my parents - who, somewhat unsurprisingly, are completely against me having a full size arcade machine in my room or anywhere in the house. While I'm fully aware that buying a used JAMMA cabinet on ebay is often by far the cheapest way to go, which is what I'd been planning on, it's just not feasible in my current situation.

Rather than postponing this dream, I'm interested in buying one of [these](http://www.turnarcades.com/products/main/classic/mini/) from turnarcades, I really like the design and the weight and dimensions are a lot more forgiving, so I could get away with owning one. Now, I do have a job and I have enough money to buy one now if I wanted to, but I am aware that it's a massive expenditure for what it is. While buying a machine on ebay along with a PCB might set me back £200-400, £600 is considerably more. Of note is that you can buy either just the bare cabinet kit, or fully assembled / painted cabinet shell from that site. The shell costs £330 with a monitor included - still a lot of money, but I figured with the reduced labour costs it would be better value to do this and buy the rest of the parts from ultimarc etc. - first consideration: am I right to assume this, and would it be worth doing to begin with?

Second consideration. Although I like MAME and have no issue with it, I'm playing with the idea of having a dedicated JAMMA cabinet. Although this is a lot more limited, it's slightly more authentic and cool, and (hopefully) would end up being cheaper. However, I can't seem to find any resources on building a JAMMA compatible cabinet from scratch. Everyone just seems to go with MAME. From what I understand JAMMA PCBs are self-contained in terms of all the electronics so you essentially just need a PCB hooked up to a power supply, controls and monitor *(is that right?)*. I also understand some of the considerations such as monitor resolution and voltages but what I really need is a guide that shows exactly what you need to buy and how to hook everything up from the ground up with reference to JAMMA, which I've had no luck finding through searches so far. Ideally I'd like to run a Vs. Super Mario Bros. PCB to start with but as they are expensive it might end up costing the same as setting up MAME.

**TL;DR the most important questions I have are:**

1. Will it end up being cheaper to build a basic JAMMA cabinet after buying either the basic kit or shell from [turnarcades](http://www.turnarcades.com/products/main/classic/mini/) than buying the vanilla full machine for £600?

2. Would setting up a basic JAMMA cabinet end up being cheaper than building the equivalent MAME cabinet if I were just to buy the kit or shell?

Once I have those questions answered, what I *really need* is a complete guide to building a JAMMA arcade machine -from scratch-

It's one of the those games I've always wanted, but never found at a decent price, until a few nights ago.

Well, I was reading up on it, and noticed that it is listed as being JAMMA+. My cabinet is set up for just plain JAMMA. I would need a kick harness (afaik) to get the stereo audio and the 4th player buttons to register. I've seen a bunch of guides online, and people talking about soldering points on their boards. I do NOT want to do that.

I am assuming (yes, I know what happens when you assume), that the standard JAMMA connector is fine, and I just need the kick harness cable. The problem is, every kick harness I've seen is just a shorter JAMMA connector, but the Namco 246 board is a 10-pin (I think?).

If anyone can take a look, and please help me find the right cables I need to make this work, that would be awesome.

Also, is the CP to much? There are 4 gamers in my house so we'll get full use out of the 4 player controls but do I have enough or too much? I have a coin+start button for each player, two buttons for the trackball, eight buttons for p1 and p2, and 4 buttons for p3 and p4. I think that should be enough for all the games we want but I haven't added any control/system buttons yet, not sure where to put them or what I need at the moment.

I have checked many websites just to give myself a rough idea on how to build my arcade. I am obviously going to use the MAME system for it, and my plan is to be able to play from atari to snes games, pretty much 8 to 16 bit games only.

My questions here are: 

Should i buy a computer screen or a tv screen? ( I am planning on use the old ones with curved glass to give it that retro look) If i get a computer screen i would not have any problem connecting the CPU tu the screen, the problem is that those old computer screens are very small (15''), and if I get a T.V i would have to buy a converter box.

How big should my screen be? Assuming that I am going to build the arcade with 2 controllers. I was thinking about getting something between 19 and 27'' but i am afraid that would be too big.

And lastly, I need to get the most important which is the CPU, and it seems it is very hard to find those old computers. My question is, what system requirements would this need?

As soon as I make up my mind I will start on buying everything to start building my arcade. I'll post some pictures of it!

I've been stalling on cutting the button holes for ages on my board because I've been super nervous about messing it up or picking a design layout I didn't like.  Well this weekend with my brother-in-law's help, we finally got the button holes cut and I'm ready to order my buttons, joysticks, and LEDs.  

I already know exactly which pushbuttons I want.  I want to use RGB LEDs and change the colors of the buttons based on what you're playing, but I also wanted classic concave style buttons.  For a long time I couldn't find any such thing, but eventually I found these.  I ordered a few of them and think they're exactly what I want!

http://www.paradisearcadeshop.com/en/il-translucent-buttons/579-hoku-il-rgb-pushbutton-psl-l-0855742005796.html

At the same time I ordered two different lighting solutions... a standard RGB LED and Paradise Arcade's Pele rings.  After demoing them, I decided I liked the standard LED better than the Pele rings.  The rings were nice but were too dim for my tastes.

For reference:

RGB LED: http://www.paradisearcadeshop.com/en/button-leds/100-il-lumination-rgb-5vdc-led-0855742001002.html
Pele ring: http://www.paradisearcadeshop.com/en/button-leds/580-pele-30mm-led-rings-0855742005802.html

(Bummer, looks like the RGB LED I ordered before is out of stock now.)

So here's my main question/problem.  The RGB LED above looked nice, but the included wiring is super short.  Are there better options for lighting that will work with the concave IL pushbuttons I've got?  I know I can extend those wires but that is going to get exhausting fast... four wires per pushbutton and I've got like 30 buttons that will be lit.  Also I've got the PacLED64 controller already, and I'll have to install the connectors to these LEDs too.  It'd be great if there were an RGB LED solution out there with longer wires and the connectors already in place for the PacLED64.  I know there's those UltraLUX buttons but I'm thinking they probably won't fit? (Side note: I realize there are not enough pins on a PacLED64 to light 30 RGB LEDs.. haven't figured out exactly how I'm going to get around that just yet)

Finally, if you just have a standard LED, how do you install them inside the pushbutton so they stay at the top of the button and don't slip out?  If I just string it through there and let it hang lose, it doesn't stay for very long.  Should I use like, hot glue or something?  Will that damage the LED?  What if a LED burns out and I need to replace one?

Summary:
1. Do I have other good options for RGB LEDs that will fit in an IL pushbutton?
2. How the heck do you install these LEDs into a pushbutton so they don't just slip out?  That is, how do you secure them?

I want to do my part and help someone in the central Texas area (i'm in San Marcos, TX) out looking to get a good foothold to start. Preferably, you are someone who is:

1) A monitor repair newbie looking to get some monitors to practice with.
2) Someone looking to learn how to do dedicated PCB repair.
3) Someone who is new to the hobby that needs some spare parts to get started.

Ideally, you are NOT:

1) A distributor
2) A flipper/reseller
3) A serial killer looking for their next victim

I'll update this list as I pull more stuff out, but here's what I've got up for grabs:


* Ms Pac Man (JAMMA board) - $50 (paid like $90 for this about a year ago, never used it. still works.)

* ~~Lethal Enforcers~~

* ~~Super Street Fighter 2: New Challengers (b board only) - $30~~

* ~~Street Fighter VS X-Men (b board only)~~ - $30

* Street Fighter II (vanilla board, sound broken) - $10

* ~~Tekken 2 - $15~~


* x2 19"" K7203 tube/chassis 
  - Neither turns on, both used to work at some point. Light screen burn. - $15

* x3 25"" K7000 chassis (NO TUBE)
  - Two work but have the same brightness issue I could not resolve. Have been professionally recapped and flybacks replaced. The third is missing a flyback and has not been recapped. $45 for the working chassis, $10 for the non-working.

* Killer Instinct ART kit - $240
  - This kit comes with the Killer Instinct marquee, Killer Instinct control panel attached to the wood and fully populated with seimetsu LED balltops and LED buttons, and both sides of the Killer Instinct side art. The art is all in nearly perfect condition (it's basically perfect but the marquee/CP have use) but I just have no use for the kit any more as I'll be combining my KI and MVC2 boards into my Super Turbo cab to create the best fighting game cabinet anyone's ever seen.

* Simpsons side art - $150
  - NOS Simpsons side art. Retails at $189 at GoG. On the fence about letting this go because I kind of want to use it on my Simpsons cab, but if you can convince me you want/need it worse than me we can work something out.

* Cruis'n Exotica project cab - $125
  - Sound doesn't work. U5000 monitor suffering from vertical collapse. As far as I can tell it coins up and plays, but can't guarantee the controls work. Replaced TDA1771 to try and fix it. Didn't work out. I suggest replacing it with an LCD (this is totally cool because the 3d racers look better with an LCD anyway). I have an unused LCD converter board I'll include with this for an extra 40, but I don't have an LCD. Sorry. :c

I always wanted to own some ArcadeCabs for years and now I just stumbled upon one while browsing for old videogames. I paid 30€ for it, it works, but got no keys. Since I never opened one before this is all very new to me. Hope someone can help me.

Here is the machine itself:
http://i.imgur.com/c6mUsS2.jpg

It is from a German manufacturer called ""Video Klein"". It has a poker game on it. It even works, but it is a very old poker game.

This is the board with the game on it:
http://i.imgur.com/SOTk4FJ.jpg

I was wondering, is this a Jamma board? All the boards I saw on the Net before always had Jamma written on it, but the connector looks like one. 

The red button will bring up a debug menu ( http://i.imgur.com/zuEvuzf.jpg ). I don't know what it means by entering a code, but some numbers show up when I press the buttons, which at least shows they all work. 
The grey cable is for the controls, the other one (blue connector) connects to another board which looks like this:

http://i.imgur.com/IIxUH5W.jpg
As you can see, it splits up but connects to the same board. 

These are the dipswitches: http://i.imgur.com/AoO1Ufa.jpg

However, I was not able to set it to Freeplay, there are just some game settings which I can change. 

I had to drill open the front door lock but did not yet open the backdoor (have to drill that one, too). So I have no clear vision on the Monitor used. 
Some questions:
Is this a Jamma board? Could I connect another Jamma game to it ?

If it is a Jamma board, can I even change the controlls? I thought the buttons would be connected one by one, not in one big cable. Since it does not have a Joystick and need one for other games, I would add one. 

If it is not a Jamma board, do you think I can just use the monitor with a ArcadeVGA in a PC and replace the buttons, etc.. ? Or do you need specifics about the monitor to check this?

Again, I am really interested in these machines, read a lot about them, but this is the first time I actually got one (by luck). In case you are wondering, it was 30€. ",,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,,True,t3_1ca6ow,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1ca6ow/got_my_first_arcadecab_got_questions/,

Bonus points to those who own a real dedicated cab or pcb board of this weeks featured game, please post pics of it! I am sure r/cade would love to see them. If you don't have a cab then Mame is cool to use too. Please lets not turn this post into a place on where to find roms. Feel free to share any experiences you may have had with the game or fun facts about it too.

So this weeks featured games are Contra and Demon Front both are “run and gun” type of games.

I picked two games this week because of the high difficulty of Contra. It is not an easy game, there is no Konami code, and you only get 3 continues. The game can be set to have 7 lives and be set to “Easy” in Mame but I still think this makes the game very challenging.

Game Info:

Contra (魂斗羅 Kontora), known as Gryzor in Europe and Oceania, is a 1987 run and gun action game developed and published by Konami originally released as a coin-operated arcade game on February 20, 1987. A home version was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988

In Contra, the player controls one of two armed military commandos named Bill ""Mad Dog"" Rizer and Lance ""Scorpion"" Bean, who are sent on a mission to neutralize a terrorist group called the Red Falcon Organization that is planning to take over the Earth. Details of the game's setting varies between supplementary materials: the Japanese versions sets the game in the year 2633 on the fictional ""Galuga archipelago"" near New Zealand, whereas the manual for the American NES version sets the game during the present in an unnamed South American island. The American storyline also changes the identity of ""Red Falcon"" from being the name of a terrorist organization to the name of an alien entity. Inspired by the movie Aliens.

Demon Front (Chinese: 魔域戰線; pinyin: Móyù Zhànxiàn) released in 2002 by IGS. Deamon Front is lesser known game with mechanics and graphics very similar to Metal Slug. Fans of the Hellboy comics will also notice the similarities to one of the games characters. This game can best be described as a Hellboy meets Metal Slug Mash up. If you're using Mame for this one you will also need the pgm.zip/bios in addition to the roms to play this game.

Each of the four characters brings along a pet, which can be sent to attack enemies or used as a shield. There are three buttons: Shoot, jump, and shield. Holding the shoot button charges your pet, and when released the pet launches a stationary devastating attack for a few seconds. The shield button converts the pet into a shield that is permanent - until you press the button again or it takes enough damage to disappear. Melee attacks and pet attacks release hearts which boost your shield power.

I really want to build my own 2 player MAME cabinet to play all kinds of old arcade games. 

Ideally, I would love to build everything from scratch and learn all the woodworking, wiring, etc skills I need to make a cabinet, unfortunately, I live in an apartment and I don't have access to a garage/workshop to build from scratch, so I'm looking for other options.  I've kept my eye on craigslist to see about buying a used cabinet, but not having a lot of luck there.  Where else can I look for a used cabinet?

My Badlands arcade has a spot for 2 locks on the front (both missing) and has 2 on the back (missing keys).

My Mame arcade doesn't have any locks yet, but I will likely be adding 2 to the front when I build a fake coin door.

I would prefer 1 master key that worked on all locks to having 6+ different sets of keys.

The SERVER PC has 4 controllers that are connected locally with 3 of those also next to each of the CLIENT PCs. The SERVER PC also has a 4-way VGA splitter with 3 of those going into each of the CLIENT PCs monitor.
When we want to play a local multiplayer game, users push a button to switch to SERVER shared output display/controllers. When we want to play a network multiplayer game, users push a button to switch to PEER local output display/keyboard.
This should allow me to connect 4 arcade cabinets together to play emulator games w/o network play, with network play and PC games.

Is there specific speakers sets that should be used? PC or Home theatre speakers? or are there any specific arcade ones?

It will be a four player machine, players 1 and 2 will have seven buttons each, and players 3 and 4 will only have four.  From what I've seen, most 4-player MAME games don't need more than four buttons, and my control box is cramped on space.

My plan currently is to get four 8-way joysticks (probably [Happ Supers](http://na.suzohapp.com/joysticks/super_joy.htm)?) for the four players, but then in the middle of the board include a single 4-way joystick for classic games like Pac-Man and Galaga.  In the case of Galaga, you would play with the 4-way stick and use player 2's buttons for firing.  

I know you can get 8-way to 4-way convertible sticks.  A friend of mine got one of the Ultimarc ones and I didn't care for them much.  I don't have any technical terms for it but it just didn't feel ""tight enough"" for games like Pacman.

Would this be a reasonable setup?  Or do people these days just use 8-way sticks in a 4-way mode for classic games and deal/get used to the inaccuracy?  Or is accuracy really that big of a deal?

I'm attempting to clean out and restore a couple of Atari Gauntlet cabinets. The main problem I have (so far) is that:

 I don't have keys for the bottom cash draws, so I can't get into the bottom quarter of the machine.

Any advice on how I can get in without doing damage?  -Will include pics when I get back downstairs :)  -thanks.

EDIT: couple of bad imgur pics: http://imgur.com/a/QFDyD

EDIT2: Ended up with my friend coming over. The locks in one machine took about 5 minutes each to drill out. Obviously better than the ones in the second machine as they went through in seconds each :)

So now I've got no excuse to get all three properly working :) http://i.imgur.com/azlnY.jpg

Thanks for everyone's advice; it's nice to get confirmation before you start destructively using power tools :)",,False,self,t5_2snqq,1343224707.0,,,True,t3_x2l70,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/x2l70/atari_gauntlet_help_me_break_in_please/,

",besmao,6,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/vc756/mame_want_to_convert_cabinet_planning_stages_lots/,"There was a big flood on my block a couple years ago.  A few weeks later, someone was tossing a cabinet down the block, so I took it.  http://imgur.com/a/wRPgS  
It's an old Mortal Kombat II cabinet, and I want to convert it to a MAME cabinet.  
A lot of the wiring is either just hanging or has been snipped by someone for some reason, but I'm not too worried about rewiring things anyway.  
  
* First things first, safety.  Are there any dangerous capacitors to be careful of while the machine is unplugged?  Any other safety concerns?  
* In the first picture, I marked in blue what I think is the water level from the flood.  The wood should still be okay with a little love though, right?  Though I'm pretty sure I have to get a new power supply.  
* Is it bad if the cabinet is laid down on its side?  It was at one point.  
* I have an old PC that just needs a new power supply.  Can it share a power supply with everything else or should I just use separate ones?  
* Any other insights into my particular machine / parts?  I believe the monitor is an MTC 900e.  I think I just need a JPac adapter.  In the first picture, I marked in green what seems to be a harness where that adapter would fit.  
* Is there any way to test monitor before diving in?  I think that's the part I'm most worried/clueless about.  
* Any suggestions for a general strategy?  Here's a list of steps I had in mind:  
-Clear out guts, take stock of what works  
-Get components working outside of cabinet  
-Refurbish the cabinet itself  
-Install everything into the cabinet  
  
Shopping list:  
Power supply  
JPac adapter  
Buttons/joysticks  
  
Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
