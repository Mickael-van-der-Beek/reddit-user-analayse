As I'm growing into a political being, I've begun to wonder who I actually admire in the cesspool that is government.  I don't know if it is my generation's zeitgeist (90's baby), but I can't help loathing pretty much everything about the state of the current U.S. government.  Is it that our generation is cynical, or that we are really at a low point in our nation's history?

So I'm trying to look back and see who our greatest leaders were.  Which, being an east coast liberal cliche, naturally led me to JFK.  Was he actually a good president, though?  It's hard to find an objective source on these matters, since everything seems to either praise or vilify based solely on the partisan politics of whoever publishes the information.  And when one actually does find an objective source, it seems almost impossible to sift through all of it and come to a conclusion.

Can any of you help me out?  I'm not looking for a political diatribe, just cold hard facts about what he accomplished and what he failed to do while in office.

TL;DR - What did JFK do that was good?  What did he do that sucked?  Thanks",,False,self,t5_2rcqc,False,,,True,t3_vfrtd,http://www.reddit.com/r/USHistory/comments/vfrtd/was_jfk_a_good_president/,

This semester I took an upper-level Southern History course and the final project for the class was a medium length research paper on a topic of our choice from 1600-1900 in Southern History.  For my topic originally, I chose to do a piece on why the Confederacy lost the American Civil War, but decided to change my topic because the first one was too generic.  Here is where I am worried...
My new paper topic had the title: ""A Southern Defense of Sherman"", about the infamous March to the Sea from late 1864 to 1865.  My professor is from the South and HATES General William T. Sherman.  I didn't find this out until late into my research/writing and therefore had to turn in the paper.  I am a little worried how he will respond to it because he is very anti-Sherman and as a southerner, I can see why.  However, I don't think that General Sherman was that bad of a guy after all of my research.

High school American history/gov't nerd here, was just hoping you guys could lend me some insight into something that was never really fully fleshed out in my history class - the evolution of the early Federalist and Anti-Federalist parties of the 1790's and early 1800's into our modern political parties, and how the social policies got flipped in the process.

My question centers around a curiosity as to exactly how the Hamiltonian Federalists, founded upon the Hamilton's economic philosophy/financial plan managed to abandon the semi-aristocratic social policies it held post-ratification and evolve into our modern Democratic party, and likewise, how Jeffersonian Republicans **somehow** managed to become our modern Republican party.

Basically, how did these early political parties maintain what was essentially uniformity in their economic philosophies through the parties' political successors, and yet, conversely, both basically reverse their course on social policies over time?

In 1967, MLK said:
“For the vast majority of white Americans, the past decade – the first phase – had been a struggle to treat the Negro with a degree of decency, not of equality. White America was ready to demand that the Negro should be spared the lash of brutality and coarse degradation, but it had never been truly committed to helping him out of poverty, exploitation or all forms of discrimination...When Negroes looked for the second phase, the realization of equality, they found that many of their white allies had quietly disappeared...The practical cost of change for the nation up to this point has been cheap. The limited reforms have been obtained at bargain rates. There are no expenses, and no taxes are required, for Negroes to share lunch counters, libraries, parks, hotels, and other facilities with whites...The real cost lies ahead...Jobs are harder and costlier than voting rolls. The eradication of slums housing is complex far beyond integrating buses and lunch counters.”

Do you think this is an accurate assessment of the era? Does this take into account the successes, failures, and problems of the movement?

I know it was the questions on US History and general US Government structures that got me, seeing as how the last time I studied US History was 18 years ago.

My first thought was to try and track down an Junior-high level history book for quick reading, and possibly any tests involved with that text.  I'm not sure exactly where to find something like that, or even if it's the best idea.

I'm looking for some books, lecture, anything about founding villages/cities in US in early times (XVIII-XIX century). I will put some sample questions to show what kind of information I'm insteresten in.

I can imagine that most of towns were built close to fresh water, natural resources, lands good for farming, maybe close to some main routes... But who actually built them? As I understand, the US were build by immigrants and in the early XIX west territories were rather uninhabited. And probably people from east were going west to find a good place for living. And here are my questions:

* It's not easy to create a village. Of course you can construct your house, but without any shops/services around, you have a hard time. So did people found new towns in a biger groups?
* The place were they founded a new town, was it belonging to anyone? Did they had to pay for it?
* How did they partition land? If people joined later, did they get land as well or they had to buy it from ...?
* Did they pay taxes? How did the goverment know about a new city and how does it collect taxes?
* How other people from outside knew about new cities, their needs?

So in general, do you know where I can find some info about living in the US at that time?

He had his weaknesses and faults. The man didn't even graduate from high school, really, and then went on to build many houses in his hometown and teach carpentry at a vocational school. I'm proud to call him family. He died about 9 months ago, and as my sister, mother and I were going through my grandparents' house, we found this gem. We all cried.

And I don't know what to say.

It don't take much writing,

the water we drink is bad.

For the little food we had.
We eat the food heartily and
stay out of way of a shell.
Then I take my pencil and write it down
""Dear Mom,"" I'm safe and well.""

We hear the night bomber
Come screaming over head,
And it isn't very pleasant
to be dodging lumps of lead.
Where I am in the trenches
I've had a shot and shell
I still have time to send a line.
""dear mom,"" I'm safe and well

While you are worried and stand
Beside the railroad track.
Waiting for the postman
With the mail in his pack.

I hope this is the right place to ask this. If it's not, please redirect me to a better place to ask.

I'm taking a US history course in college right now and history isn't my best subject. I'm more of a math and science person, and seeing direct cause to effect makes more sense to me. History does have a cause to effect pattern, but it's much more difficult for me to see. 

However I've been watching a lot of Doctor Who and have been wrapping my brain around time travel and how you shouldn't change anything if you can help it, and I got to thinking: **there are a few pivotal points in US history that if the outcome were to go in the other direction, history would change dramatically**. For instance, things I've thought about include: **if the South had won the civil war (or for that matter if the civil war hadn't even happened at all); if WWI didn't happen, would the Great Depression have occurred? And if it hadn't, would the US have become the world leader that it is today?** I feel like the push for trade after the Great Depression and certainly post-WWII trade helped push us into US hegemony.

- McCullough's John Adams was fantastic.
- Isaacsson's Ben Franklin was fantastic. Yes, I know. 
- Meacham's Andrew Jackson was a giant turd. Hated the writing style and didn't like the gossipy content.
- McCullough's Truman was okay, but biased, and glossed over so much important stuff in his presidency (the bomb, the Marshall Plan) in favor of every station on the whistlestop campaigns.
- Korda's Ike was bad, horribly biased and almost as much about the author's family friends as Eisenhower, and literally spent 60 pages on his two terms a president, out of a 720 page book.

I've read and enjoyed both Washington and Jefferson, but I can't recall the authors, and they're buried on a bookshelf somewhere.

My requisite survey course, US from 1865 until the present began today and we began discussing the differences between ""history"" and ""the past."" Of course, the topic of the Civil War came up, because we're reading about Reconstruction for the next course meeting. 

A young, white, male student voiced the opinion that the Southern states had much more of an emotional tie to the Civil War and that the Northern states didn't. He said basically that the war didn't do anything for the North, that it wasn't changed because of the Civil War. I am inclined to disagree with him, though I suppose one could get a sense of stoicism (little s) from the North. Certainly the South has been more vocal about mythology surrounding the legacy of the their war experience. There has been recent scholarship about how my state of Kentucky actually became more Southern following the Civil War.

What do you think, /r/USHistory? What do you think that the North had at stake with the war and was it inherently changed as a result?

Thus reads my thesis: 

&gt;“It is clear in both the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution that the founding fathers shifted away from the idea of the United States as a collective of sovereign countries to the idea of one country comprised of many individual identities. In comparing and analyzing the two documents, one can uncover the reasons for this change.”

My first point is that under the AoC, the only form of what we would call a federal government was Congress, or more specifically, the united States, in Congress assembled (no typo on united). This was just a body of delegates from each of the states, and was the only governing body of the newly formed ""perpetual union"".  When they rewrote the Constitution, they created the Executive branch as we know it now (a President, VP, other officials etc; Congress = senate + house). That difference is indicative that the individual state governments weren't enough to keep things okay. And hopefully I can explain that point better in the actual paper, herpa derp.

My second point is what I wanted to ask about: I wanted to talk about the contrast in judicial systems before and after the Constitution. From what I've been able to glean from the AoC, it doesn't seem like there was anything close to a Supreme Court; Congress only intervened with matters of state boundaries and issues of that size/magnitude, and the state governments were in charge of justice among their own, making state court the highest court. With the Constitution came the Supreme court, making it the highest court in the land. 

My question is: am I right in thinking that before the Constitution there were only state courts? And off the top of your head, if you think of any other differences between the two documents that show that shift towards one country, I'd be pleased as punch to hear them. 

tl;dr were there only state courts before the Constitution?",,False,self,t5_2rcqc,False,,,True,t3_vm1jz,http://www.reddit.com/r/USHistory/comments/vm1jz/a_question_on_the_articles_of_confederation_and/,

There is a lot to be desired from just the American narrative that is placed as the all inclusive biography for the domestic and international public mind.

I'm sure there will not be just ""one"" book. I can read, French, Portuguese and Spanish. So any text in those languages would be great as well. Thank you so much Reddit. I'll respond as soon as I am able to do so today (heading to work).

They keep asking me for good movies about US History. I wanted to make a series of movies, documentary and commercial, to suggest they watch. I was hoping I could enlist your help and we could come up with a list (complete with links) that covered the gamut of American History. 

As people add things I will post them here in chronological order. At the least, please provide a link to the IMDB page of the movies you are citing. If it's available online for streaming post that as well (or if you really feel inclined and you're into piracy post the torrent site). 

Please leave the following-


**Subject Matter- Movie Name [](link) ** Then you can talk about it or let us know if it's a documentary or otherwise. If it's not a documentary let us know how historically accurate it is. 

(*PS- Where I am I don't have access to IMDB so sorry I didn't follow my own directions. I'm coming back to add more later, this was just all I could smash out in thirty minutes. Feel free to criticize or modify what I've already added.*)


**MOVIES**

**The French and Indian War- The Last of the Mohicans**[From Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_the_Mohicans_%281992_film%29) This is a dramatization of the story of an adopted Mohican Indian during the French and Indian War. It’s a great movie but only gives information about the war incidentally to advance the plotline. 

**The American Revolution- The Revolution: The Series** [From History Channel Online Store](http://shop.history.com/detail.php?p=69702&amp;v=history&amp;ecid=PRF-2101725&amp;pa=PRF-2101725.) This is an informative documentary series from the History Channel covering many aspects of the Revolution. 

**John Adams- John Adams the miniseries** [From Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_%28miniseries%29#Historical_inaccuracies) Thoroughly entertaining HBO miniseries about the life of John Adams, although it is fraught with [historical inaccuracies]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_%28miniseries%29#Historical_inaccuracies)

**Andrew Jackson- Andrew Jackson: Good, Evil and the Presidency** [From PBS]( http://www.pbs.org/kcet/andrewjackson/) This is a documentary by PBS which I’ve yet to watch but which has come to me with great reviews from friends. 

**The Slave Trade and the buildup to the Civil War- Amistad [From Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amistad_%28film%29) This is a great movie, based on a true story, about a slave mutiny aboard the ship *Amistad* in 1839 and the ensuing legal battle.

**World War II/George Patton- Patton** [From Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_%28film%29) This is an excellent dramatization of the life of general George S. Patton. The film won Best Picture and has become an iconic piece of American film history, with the famous opening scene where George C. Scott delivers the monologue in front of the waving American flag. 

**Cuban Missile Crisis-Thirteen Days** [From Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Days_%28film%29) This is a *docudrama* about JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

**Muhammad Ali-Ali** [From Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_%28film%29) This is a biopic about the man who was once considered the most famous person in the world (yeah no citation on that whatevs). 

**Richard Nixon- Nixon** [From Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_%28film%29) This is a highly stylized, therefore somewhat inaccurate nonetheless excellent biopic about Richard Nixon. Anthony Hopkins was nominated for the Academy Award for his role in this movie. 

**Watergate-Dick** [From Wikipedia]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_%28film%29) This is a very, very inaccurate yet funny look at the Watergate scandal. As far as facts it doesn’t help out much but it’s a comical way to contextualize the scandal. 

Thanks for your help! I can't wait to see what you come up with. I apologize for the very unacademic leaning of my list but hopefully you can help me fill the gaps.

Hey guys, sorry for kind of spamming this sub-reddit but I need some help. I have to do an essay on the reasons why the Republican's dominated 1920s presidential politics.

I have a few books but I'm really struggling to find specific reasons for why they were popular, most of what I read focuses on policies, but not rise or decline of the Progressives. I'm keen to argue that they were lucky coming just after Wilson and with a booming economy that made people lose interest on social causes for example. But again, need more evidence to back this up (And views that disagree for balance in fact).

I'm working this summer on an archaeological (more of a combination of oral history, research, and archaeology really) internship in the Bethel Christian Avenue Laurel Hill Historic District in Setauket, NY. This historic Native and African American community has been struggling against discrimination since its establishment around 200 years ago and they now face an even greater threat in the gentrification that has degraded the community in recent years (They've gone from 40 local families around 50 years ago to a mere 14 today).

I've gotten to know some of the residents and they are wonderful people, always welcoming and helpful and talking to any of them, especially their elders reveals the vibrant nature of this community's valuable culture. 

The Higher Ground Inter-Cultural &amp; Heritage Association, formed by one of the remaining community members, desires to preserve this historic culture. They've done amazing work, even achieving their goal of creating the historic district (the only one in NY state designated as such for its cultural rather than architectural value). But to do much more they need funds.

So they entered and became a finalist in this National Trust competition. But they're having trouble spreading the word. So in the interest of preserving history and helping a community I'm entreating you guys to vote for us. All that's needed to vote is an email address and a zip code and it doesn't take more than a minute.

**tl;dr Historical minority community needs money for its preservation. Links to local news story and video about the project and the voting link below.**

2) Why did the new deal fail to spark economic recovery? Since it did not, why do you think that FDR was so popular?

3) Why did conservatives object to the New Deal? Was their criticism valid?

I'm only about halfway through but I am really enjoying it.

It's historical fact with fiction (supposedly) only in dialogue and thought.  For example, the first scene is the Boston Massacre, the incident unfolds through the eyes and mind of a British soldier; the details are accurate, the only thing that is fiction is his thought process and feelings which are still as accurate as possible to what they actually were probably feeling.

It's a good read, it's completely accurate as far as the timeline and the encounters go I believe.  There were a couple scenes that I questioned the accuracy of, a quick Google search helped prove that the encounter or incident did happen, the only thing added was dialogue and I think the author did extremely well at getting to the head of America's historic figures.

Rise to Rebellion is the prelude to the actual revolution, it ends with the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the next book is called The Glorious Cause, which is the actual revolution unfolding.  I'm definitely going to read it next.

All other aspects of the context of each strip are easily deciphered, but there were *two* individuals with the surname Bundy who were prominent in policy circles at the time: brothers [William Bundy] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bundy) and [McGeorge Bundy] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGeorge_Bundy), and my criteria for this survey demands that I make my best effort to learn which Bundy brother was meant in each strip.

In the former strip, published [May 8, 1971] (http://www.gocomics.com/doonesbury/1971/05/08), college students Mike Doonesbury and Mark Slackmeyer have gone to Washington, D.C. to take part in a ""Peace March"" (likely inspired by the planned [May Day Protests] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_May_Day_Protests)), and they remain to hobnob with politicians and journalists.

The surname Alsop mentioned in the strip refers to Joe Alsop, a columnist whose optimistic evaluation that we were seeing a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" in Vietnam made him a subject of frequent derision by those opposed to the War. The surname Schlesinger obviously refers to historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a Kennedy confidante, Nixon critic, and two-time Pulitzer Prizewinner.

I've decided that the ""Bundy"" mention in this strip refers to McGeorge Bundy for two reasons: First, a Google search for **alsop schlesinger ""McGeorge Bundy""** returns far more results than the equivalent search for William Bundy. Second, an [LA Times review] (http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/books/bk-14881) of Schlesinger's autobiography identifies McGeorge as one of Schlesinger's closest friends.

In the latter strip, published [March 8, 1973] (http://www.gocomics.com/doonesbury/1973/03/08), college student B.D. is researching the origins of the Vietnam War for a Political Science paper, and calls a Bundy brother (said to have ""advised [President] Johnson"" to escalate the war) to inquire about the origins of U.S. involvement. The unspecified Bundy blames Kennedy/Johnson Defense Secretary Robert McNamara instead.

Both Bundys served as advisors to President Johnson, but McGeorge did so in a more senior role, as National Security Advisor. Additionally, the Wikipedia article for William Bundy claims (without reference to a primary source) that William was considered ""dovish"" on Vietnam. For these two reasons, I've decided that this mention refers to McGeorge Bundy as well.

I would really appreciate your help reddit. I'm looking for a unique hypothesis but everything that I choose comes out to be quite common (I thought of exploring ""The Israel Lobby has large influence over American Foreign Policy decision"" and then investigating if this is true or not).

And I decided to write about the period between the Seven Years' War and the revolution. I'm going to try to use the context that the Proclamation of 1763 created to show that settlers outside the colonies had a large impact on the lead up to the revolution.

So far one major example that sticks out to me is the march on Philadelphia by the Paxton Boys. So do you guys know of any other major examples? Or anything else that should be touched on in my paper?

Also, I think I'm going to try and argue that instances like the Paxton Boys were a large contributor to the divergence in identity from English to American.

Were the military escorts from each individual's home? or did they meet somewhere first? if so where did they meet? what were the rules of the escorts? did they go to class with the students?  did the military ever actually have to stop anyone from doing anything or was their presence enough?
