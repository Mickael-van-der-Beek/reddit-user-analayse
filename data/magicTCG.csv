1375211248.0,2161,self.magicTCG,1jd8o3,ESPN employee wants to ask: Would You Want to See M:tG on ESPN again?,chikago12,3755,1594,465,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1jd8o3/espn_employee_wants_to_ask_would_you_want_to_see/,"The last time M:tG was on ESPN, it went poorly, due to a couple facts:

1. The technology wasn't there, so the cards were barely visible.  Watch this clip: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DECaN66tm0k.  It's Finkel v. Maher, one of the most exciting games ever played.  It was barely watchable for me because I didn't know any of the cards because I didn't play during that time, and couldn't make them out in the video.  I even knew the rules-imagine someone who doesn't.

2. This was on ESPN2, on TV, which I don't think is the best medium for a niche game like M:tG.  Magic players have always been on the forefront of utilizing the internet as a means to better access this game that we all love, and streaming basically goes hand in hand with that.  Also, if you're watching a game on a stream, all you need is to hear the name of the card and you can gatherer it, and you have something to do in during the downtime in between rounds/shuffling.  

M:tG is more popular now than ever before.  The barrier to entry to M:tG is probably equal to that of poker, which is on ESPN all the time.  ESPN recently launched their new streaming service, Watch ESPN. I think this has a ton of potential.

I think it'd be really interesting to see M:tG on ESPN again, and a great time to evaluate whether or not this relationship can work is during this upcoming week's world championship.  This potentially could work for both parties (Wizards gets advertising, ESPN gets a ton of young viewers on Watch ESPN).  Also, I think ESPN can really push the technology such that pro M:tG becomes even more popular and watchable (like being able to hover your mouse over the card and have the oracle text pop up in real time).  


Full Disclosure: I'm a Production Assistant for ESPN, and I'm basically guaging interest to see if this is worth pitching to my superiors.

Thanks for your time and responses.  

EDIT 1: Woah did not expect this kind of response.  I'll do my best to find out what kind of #'s Watch ESPN gets, and what kind of numbers Twitch gets.  If I do pitch this, I'll be sure to do so by letting my bosses know: MtG'ers aren't going to pay for online streaming because WOTC already produces a very good stream for free.  If they were goingto produce a stream, it'd have to be better than the one WOTC or SCG already produces.  I'll also let tehm know that M:tGer's are willing to watch ads if they are being provided with a free stream, and that there's a group among those who willing to pay so that they don't have to watch ads.  I don't think this pitch is going to be for a little while (I just started about two weeks ago) but I'm excited to have so many different voices and ideas available here.  Thanks guys.

RemoveFromGame is a new company created by cards players. We're a small company trying to get our name out, so we thought a giveaway here would be a good idea. So for every 50 upvotes, we will randomly select a user who commented on this thread and send them some round cornered sleeves. The winner can also decide to choose any other type of sleeve they want if they're not interested in the round corner ones on www.hiddensupplies.com


You can also see how the new sleeves are in this youtube video as well http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvRnIhaKQyM&amp;feature=plcp

And our company is hoping to improve our products to make the best sleeves out there so we welcome suggestions.

If interested in buying some sleeves, you can check out www.hiddensupplies.com

I'll also be answering any questions in this post. 


Edit: After 24 hours, RFG will randomly select people to send sleeves to and At 1500 upvotes, I'm going to have to stop the giveaway, I really didn't expect this thread to blow up so fast. I'm really sorry to announce the limit but as a small company, we can't afford to ship to so many people after 1500 upvotes.

Something along the lines of ""That deck is so interactive that it can't have good games."".

Even when a fellow player defended him saying ""People have fun doing different things. I hate it when people invalidate ""non-interactive"" magic. It's a part of the game and it is perfectly ok for him to have fun with Bant Hexproof."" he was met with further attacks and downvoting.

When asked to justify their attacks the response was ""Bant hexproof being non interactive and bad magic is a common agreement."" Which translates to ""Attacking people is okay as long as you're agreeing with the circle-jerk."". This is the worst thing that can happen to a community. The circle-jerk keeps the entire community stupid and stagnant with no potential for growth. r/leagueoflegends figured this out barely a year into its existence and has fought to keep the circle-jerking at a minimum ever since. 

I was also then told to ""grow up"" for defending my fellow player. Classy.

Frankly, even if you agree with it, that is complete and utter garbage. Seeing someone attacked based on how he has fun with the game makes me absolutely ashamed to be apart of this community.

I'll end this with a message to my fellow spikes: Competition is good but keep it on the board. Don't bring your superiority complex to the discussion board. Bringing your salt and negativity to everyday conversation WILL harm this community. There's a reason so many people think magic players are arrogant pricks.

Edit: To those who have read the thread and called me out on losing my cool, i agree and i apologize. While the nature of Jeffs comment was negative, it wasn't really all that bad. However the problem isn't his comment, it's the overall arrogance and animosity i see towards those who don't agree with the circle jerk. His comment was just the straw that broke the camels back for me. Thank you for reading.

Edit 2: Just look at this comment section. There's so many people trying to add to the conversations only to receive a ton of downvotes. **THE DOWNVOTE BUTTON IS NOT YOUR PERSONAL ""I DISAGREEE"" BUTTON. IT IS THERE TO GET RID OF FLUFF SO THAT THOSE WITH REAL COMMENTARY CANT HAVE THEIR VOICES HEARD.**

Edit 3: Someone pointed out that my example isn't a very good representative of the point i was trying to make so instead i'll reference something that happened a few weeks ago where someone said they felt Vexing Devil was a strong card in standard and was met with a ton of negativity and downvoting until he explained that it synergizes extremely well with Varolz and Morbid.

It's also simply more efficient if all the spoilers are in one place, and manually compiling the text spoilers here helps people who are stuck behind firewalls and other filters.

After seeing Cockatrice in legal trouble, I'm annoyed as all hell with Wizards and Hasbro. As many argued, Cockatrice was used as a playtesting tool for many people. That's exactly how I've used it. And you know what? I've spent nearly $700 on Magic in the last 4 MONTHS alone. And I'm sure there are many people in this same boat (if not more). I would guess Magic players spend orders of magnitude more money on Magic than any video game addict spends on one production company's video games. And those studios survive on sales, just like Wizards or any other company. Yet, we're all shelling more money to this company, and they want to take away our tool for helping us understand how we should spend more money.

And that's not even the biggest issue. They want us to pay twice for all of our cards. And MTGO is a fucking joke. It's a piece of shit. And it's Windows only. Are you kidding me?

This platform needs to be sexy as hell. A Mac version is an absolute necessity - blows my mind. Mac, iOS and Android versions should already exist. I'm sorry, but you're getting enough of our hard earned money. The least you can do is either let us play for free online on junky software, or give us a god damn good reason to shovel in our money at twice the rate.

/rant.

Edit: They have the capacity to expand MTGO to other platforms. Just look at Magic 2013 software - It's on iOS, Xbox 360, etc. And its not bad, but it's more or less an intro into the real game.",,False,,t5_2qn5f,1362016797.0,,,True,t3_19cr2r,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/19cr2r/hey_hasbrowizards_mtgo_sucks_fix_it_instead_of/,

1350659508.0,1040,self.magicTCG,11r0bc,"Newbie first night out playing at local shop - surprised by the ""regulars""",Chewy_27,1270,230,226,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/11r0bc/newbie_first_night_out_playing_at_local_shop/,"Being a board gamer, table top wargamer for what seems like forever I remember when Magic first was released.  A couple buddies and I each got one starter pack with two booster, shuffled your cards together and had at it.  It was a blast.  Then the deck crafting began.  One guy had WAY more money than the rest of us that he was willing to pump into his Magic cards.  He stomped us.  At this point there was no shops selling single cards (at least in our area) it was all about the booster pack lottery ticket.  I realized that realistically there was no way I was ever going to be able to beat him, so handed all my cards to one of my friends and walked away, never to go back....... or so I thought.

Fast forward 20 years and I have a 7 year old daughter.  We were in at our local game shop/book store [Chat Noir Books in New Liskeard](http://chatnoirbooks.com/) and my daughter sees some of the Magic cards/decks and asks about them.  The store owner hears me explaining it to her and gives us a couple ""intro packs"".  Sorry I don't know exactly what they were, but they had some land and some basic cards all of one colour.  We took them home and my daughter was hooked.  She loved it.  Now she is pretty mature for her age and has been gaming her whole life so it is not a simple rule that all 7 years olds can play Magic.  But seeing the workout it was giving her math and reading skills it was perfect. 

So over the past 6 months or so she has saved up a bit of her allowance and purchased a couple booster packs and even a play mat.  I had heard there was going to be a release party/tournament at Chat Noir and talked to Paul one of the owners about it.  He said that this wasn't the kind of thing that my daughter would enjoy but just to wait and that he would be having an event soon that she would like.  Well that event came last night.

He broke the people there into two groups.  The ""competitive"" players were in the back and he brought us newbies with a couple experienced players out to the front.  He got us both registered with DCI numbers and explained how the booster draft system worked.  We then went through a booster draft with the 6 of us that were up front.  Then they helped us sort through the mess of cards we had picked to get a deck built.  When they were talking to my daughter about her deck and maybe taking a certain colour of creatures out they didn't even laugh at her when she said ""No, I really like that beast guy too, I want him in with all his friends""  

Then the games started.  She played against me first, we had a couple close games but I managed to win.  Then for the next round she had to play against one of the experienced players.  He was super patient with her and helping to explain his cards that he was playing and how they worked.  After he won the first game he asked if she wanted to play again but this time use his deck.  She took him up on his offer and then proceeded to crush him with his own deck.  Smiling all the while with this MTG crown on her head that one of the guys had given her. [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/QE1fv)

After the ""regular"" games were done they showed us how mini masters worked and we managed to get in a couple games of that which was really enjoyable.  

My daughter while building her deck had said that she really like the Merfolk as well as the Angels and I had said that I was enjoying the Vampires.  All the while the mini masters were being played and afterwards people were coming up to us and giving us cards.  ""I know you like Merfolk and I am not going to use this guy, you should just have him"" or ""This guy is great in a Vampire deck.  Just take him and put him to use.""  or ""I don't need these commons, you just take them""  Then the prizes came out, a roll of the dice and then pick a foil card off of that page in a binder full of cards.  Our collection of Magic cards went up by a factor of 5 just last night.  I had to buy a box just to get all the cards home.

We couldn't have had a better time.  I understand that it is hard to have to play against a child in a game like this, but absolutely everyone there was fantastic.  Super helpful and friendly.  Chat Noir put on a great event and definitely pulled two more Magic players into it's folds.  So for anyone thinking about heading to their local shop please do, you might be surprised at how it goes.

Now I just have to start reading on exactly how to build a reasonable deck.  :)

**tldr**: New players, one a 7 year old, headed to local game shop and things go better than expected.

**Edit ** Wow, I didn't really expect this kind of response folks.  I am glad you are all enjoying our story.  Here is the picture of my daughter.

Either way, I was hoping outside of that improper context we could get some discussion about this list (truth, redundancy, inaccuracy, omissions).

Without further ado...

**The Real 50 Rules of Magic**

-----------------------------------------

1. Magic is actually about fifteen different games. Some of them don't even have names.

2. You can lose before the game starts.

3. Your wallet can be part of the game.

4. The game can be played with the cards still in the binder.

5. The cards don't always do what they say.

6. Your intuition about how good a card is will probably be wrong.

7. All the rules have exceptions.

8. Some basic lands cost more money than most mythics.

9. The best deck in the format can be the worst.

10. The worst color in the format can be the best.

11. Just because it's an instant doesn't mean you *have* to use it on their turn.

12. Being at low life doesn't mean you're losing. Winning at 1 life, 9 infect, or 0 cards in library is still winning.

13. Having more permanents on the board doesn't mean you're winning.

14. Playing with lands in your deck is optional in several formats. (Technically, it's always an option.)

15. Regression to the mean should not surprise you.

16. Don't be results oriented.

17. Trust your intuition, except when its wrong.

18. Constructed decks are 75 cards.

19. Starting with 7 is a privilege, not a right.

20. MTGO is not equal to paper Magic. DotP is not equal to anything.

21. Just because something can't be countered doesn't mean it is uncounterable.

22. You can target things that can't be targeted *if they're on the stack*. Funny that.

23. You don't know how the game works. Don't worry, 99% of ""pro"" players don't. Not even Zvi Mowshowitz knows the layer rules.

24. Your opponent doesn't have your best interests in mind.

25. You will leak information. Try not to leak so much.

26. If you get flustered and put that land from the top of your deck right into play with a frustrated sigh, that's a very clear sign I should go all in.

27. Unless you're playing me, in which case, nicely done.

28. When you scoop your cards, you lose, even if you weren't actually losing.

29. Creatures are optional.

30. EDH is a friendly casual format where Mana Drain, Sol Ring, Necropotence and Mishra's Workshop are legal cards.

31. No one calls it ""Commander"".

32. Magic players will overuse their slang because they love to durdle like misers until they get too salty from their opponent hitting the stone blade cold nuts. Then they actively want to kill themselves.

33. The less you respect your opponent, the harder you will tilt when he mops the floor with you.

34. Just because he's 300 lbs and breathes through his mouth doesn't mean his cards won't kill you.

35. Yes Virginia, sometimes they just draw runner runner runner runner. It can happen to Chapin, it can happen to you.

36. Offering a handshake can be considered a hostile action.

37. Magic players are such outstanding citizens that the comprehensive floor rules have an explicit penalty for stealing the table markers.

38. Yes, some people have(had) $100,000 worth of Magic cards. Yes, there are people who love cardboard more than you do. People have been killed (literally) for their collections.

39. Some people pin their entire self-worth on the performance of their rogue deck. Exploit that.

40. If your opponent tells you you played terribly, you probably did something right.

41. The card you think won you the game is not the card that won you the game.

42. Magic is the meaning to life, the universe and everything.

43. The aggro-midrange-control framework is a simplistic guideline that is often wrong about how matchups will play out.

44. Testing 10 games is not representative.

45. Testing 10 games can still be enough to understand a matchup.

46. Two different players can pilot the same deck very differently.

47. Different formats and matchups have different levels of variance.

48. Most people use the terms variance, randomness, luck, and skill loosely and incorrectly.

49. Don't play a bad version of something else.

50. Read. The. Freaking. Card. Except see rule 5.

Happy New Year!

To ring in 2013 right, I come bearing the exclusive Reddit preview card for Gatecrash.

I'm really excited for Gatecrash and I'm sure you all will be too. This card speaks to me, as a proud Boros legionnaire. I'm sure you all will agree, this guy is going to bash some faces :)

[Foundry Champion](http://media.wizards.com/images/magic/tcg/products/gtc/9wstmvlpdq_en.jpg)

For those who can't load the image:

Foundry Champion {4}{R}{W}

Creature - Elemental Soldier (Rare)

When Foundry Champion enters the battlefield, it deals damage to target creature or player equal to the number of creatures you control.

{R}: Foundry Champion gets +1/+0 until end of turn.

{W}: Foundry Champion gets +0/+1 until end of turn.

4/4

It was supposed to be a game shop but without any customers it's was just a room. Each day I'd sort magic the gathering cards, eat a couple candy bars, and go home. 

I was excited that I got a new job but slowly my hours were diminishing each day. 

I couldn't decide which phrase should be our store slogan: 

""Wanna close early?"" or ""Well, that didn't work""

On April 18th, 2012 I contacted a mod and asked if it was alright if I posted about our store opening. (I wasn't quite sure if letting people know about the store violated any rules)

They said it should be alright as long as I presented it the right way.

April 19th was when everything changed. Eighteen people passed through our shop in one day, Just to check it out.

During the draft of April 20th, so many people arrived that we ran out of DCI cards. We unpacked them the day before.

When a newbie store holds it's first sanctioned draft, (With a huge crowd no less) and has several delays (including but not limited to closing Wizards event reporter halfway through) 
what do the people of Reddit do?

They pay for another draft afterwords and we do it right.

If you had to go and couldn't stay for the second draft, it was still so unbelievably awesome that people showed up.

You know what people did after people walked through the door? They walked through the door too.

No joke, it felt like Christmas. Christmas as a kid.

It was the moment that made us believe everything was possible.

We were open til 4 a.m. laughing, listening to music, drinking sodas and having a good time. This is something we wanted for the store so bad.

Reddit, thank you. Thank you for showing up. Thank you for trading in cards, being patient with our Follies, and telling your friends about us.

I am soooo tired because last night was soooo awesome. 

Reddit, we exists now. We're not just a room that no one knows about.

You saved our card store.

**Why we do this:** /r/magictcg is a great subreddit, and this is our way of doing a service for the community. It's also simply more efficient if all the spoilers are in one place, and manually compiling the text spoilers here helps people who are stuck behind firewalls and other filters. Beyond that, we really enjoy seeing the commentary from this subreddit, and that wouldn't happen if no one did this.

Edit for deliverance:
To further explain the situation and answer some questions, I met Andrew at FNM and he had a small collection of rares from old sets he was selling. I was talking to him about meeting him at his place to look at the rest of the collection and pick it up from him. We (my room mate and I, didn't go alone) to follow him to his house and take a look at the cards. He lives in a small town outside of the city I live in, about 30-35 minutes away, and it was a town I was unfamiliar with, making it difficult to remember exactly where he lived since I wasn't driving. It was also dark, the highways weren't lit, and I was just excited about picking up the collection and not paying attention to where we going. After sorting through the collection I was going to add the cards to my book, and noticed I couldn't find my bag. I realized shortly I had left it at his home, and then made this post because it was 4 AM and I wasn't going to drive to his home. However, the next morning, with a little help from google earth I was able to narrow down where he lived, and after about 15 minutes of driving around the town I found where he lived. I showed up today at his house and his stepmother was home and returned the bag, I have my collection back. I posted this before I went to bed last night in hopes that he would see this. He didn't, but I found his home and everything is okay. This whole scenario was just a huge snowball of goof-ups, sorry for making this post so vague, I'm not trolling for karma.

I woke up to some [fantastic spoilers](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/s5muh/avacyn_restored_spoilers_for_april_12th/), great way to start the day.

You should now be able to set your user flair.  Big thanks to TheCid, s-mores (our newest moderator), and the rest of the mod team who worked on implementing this change to the subreddit and on managing our developing relationship with WotC.  It looks fantastic, and I'm proud to be able to fly my favored guild colors and insignia.

This is a good place for anyone who has questions/suggestions/comments on flair to post them.  We'll respond throughout the day.

------
We saw how quickly the discussion about our relationship with Wizards exploded, and we noticed a strong anti-censorship theme.  This is good!  We, as moderators, dislike the specter of censorship as much as anyone else.  Here's what we want you to know.  

-**We always have and always will remove content that we find hateful, offensive, or libelous.** It has always been our goal to create and maintain a safe and supportive environment for discussing our favorite pastime and this does not represent a change in the way we moderate our subreddit.

-If you need a place to leak illicit and/or unofficial spoilers, don't do it here. If you found those spoilers somewhere else on the internet and want to link to them, summarize them, or report on them, do it right away because we all want to read them. But read the official spoiler thread first, because nobody likes reposts.

-If WotC approaches us about content that needs to be taken down, we'll evaluate their request and the impact it would have on our community. If we decide we can't comply with their request while maintaining Reddit's longstanding tradition of free speech, removing their copyrighted imagery from our layout would be a no-brainer. WotC has been great to us so far; we've had employee AMA's and Reddit exclusive spoilers, and we're working with them on some other cool surprises for you down the road.  We'd hate to lose our friendly relationship with WotC over anything less than a critical existential issue, so we might remove some content if we're asked to do so **and** if we agree that the content is illegal, unethical, offensive, or otherwise reasonable to remove.

-**We're here for a reason, and we're devoted to maintaining a space for open and free discourse about MtG to take place.** So if we start to feel a censorship vise tightening, rest assured we'll make that known and find a way to correct the situation.  We hope we can count on the community not to abuse this forum and invite increased scrutiny/censorship.

-------

**Phew!**  That was a lot.

Any questions?  We'll be around.  If you just want to comment to show off your flair and/or declare war on rival guilds, that's cool too.

**This is a self post.** Your upvotes are powerless to give me karma (but they still let everyone else read this thread so you should give them pls).

Most of you know the drill, but here it is anyway. For the next few weeks, we at /r/magicspoilers will sacrifice what is known as ""sleep"" to consolidate all of the spoilers into a single thread that allows for discussion to occur in one place. I don't enjoy anything, all the other people who said what they enjoy in this sentence suck.

---------

**Why we do this:** there's no reason to have 15 threads with the same subject matter on a subreddit, people get pissed, they miss out on other topics, and sometimes it dilutes a big piece of news itself because there's 15 threads about the same subject with 10 upvotes, instead of 1 with 150 upvotes. This consolidation is both good for us that have too much time on our hands at home, and you guys who want to be able to click near the top of /r/magicTCG and find what you're looking for as well.

**Boros**: *""In case of fire, treachery, citywide riot, political upheaval, or worldwide social collapse, break glass."" - Cluestone inscription*

**Dimir**: *It waits in the nameless chill of the undercity, holding nameless secrets for those who dare to touch it.*

**Golgari**: *Golgari mold collects whispers, intelligence that is later harvested by Jarad and his high chancellors.*

**Gruul**: *Forgotten under rocks and vines, Gruul symbols mark the sites of primitive rituals where shamans once chanted to the wild.*

**Izzet**: *It holds within it an unsolvable riddle. A creative answer yields an invitation to the guild.*

**Orzhov**: *A symbol of power and wealth, the only commodities that matter to the Orzhov.*

**Rakdos**: *""Burn. Bleed. Enjoy."" - Cluestone inscription*

**Selesnya**: *""Break it if you must. The loss of one relic is nothing next to the value of enriching us all."" - Suniel the Woodwise*

**Simic**: *Simic symbols are among the most intricate and fragile, yet few vandalize them for fear of the strange lifeforms that might be released.*

**Possibility Storm** 3RR ([source](http://www.cranialinsertion.com/article/855))

Enchantment (Rare)

Whenever a player casts a spell from his or her hand, that player exiles it, then exiles cards from the top of his or her library until he or she exiles a card that shares a card type with it. That player may cast that card without paying its mana cost. Then he or she puts all cards exiled with Possibility Storm on the bottom of his or her library in a random order.

Hey guys, there was some brief discussion in /r/magicspoilers and I'm not sure if twotwoberz has mentioned it anywhere on /r/magicTCG regarding what we had concluded regarding posting a spoiler album on imgur or something like that, we concluded that a spoiler album shouldn't be linked to in the immediate threat the instant these cards are spoiled.  

The mentality behind it is that it is spoiler season, and while it is sometimes a complete pain in the ass, the spoilers from wizards.com or given from to another website are supposed to be promotional for the site itself, it's meant to generate traffic, and while it's nice to have the easiest access possible to the spoiler in picture form all the time (And sometimes in the main thread it ends up like that anyway for a few cards here and there,) it can tend to take away from some of the publicity that should be generated to the website itself when we put things into an imgur album and just click away.  

This may be an unpopular idea but my suggestion was to wait ~12 hours after the spoilers are released before linking to a spoiler album in pure picture form, which /u/twotwobearz said he felt that, ""That seems reasonable,"" but we'd love the community's input as well, while keeping what I previously stated in mind.   

***Edit: While we can somewhat gauge the community's reaction by up and down votes, a response would be much appreciated with it. Upvoting and replying, ""I agree,"" or downvoting and writing, ""That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard,"" is much more valuable than pressing a or z on the post.***

I will update this post as needed throughout the day. If something new comes up, please post a comment and add it to the thread, along with the source (not just an image).

**Why we do this:** /r/magictcg is a great subreddit, and this is our way of doing a service for the community. It's also simply more efficient if all the spoilers are in one place, and manually compiling the text spoilers here helps people who are stuck behind firewalls and other filters. Beyond that, we really enjoy seeing the commentary from this subreddit, and that wouldn't happen if no one did this.

1367123240.0,685,self.magicTCG,1d98rf,Do the Newbies a favor--don't cheat.,rt_tlp,817,132,441,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1d98rf/do_the_newbies_a_favordont_cheat/,"So I attended my first prerelease today. My best friend came along, she's a sweet girl. Not good at most games that require strategy, but she has fun.

So, she makes some AMAZING pulls from her packs. Including Ral Zarek, and Savageborn Hydra. Here's the thing that kills me...

The entire day, she kept managing to get Savageborn Hydra out on the field. I told her it was a good card, but she didn't understand why. At the end of the night, I figured out why she didn't think it was great; she didn't know how double strike worked. She thought that ""double strike"" only applied to the first turn it was summoned (she said she needed a way to put Haste on it to make it useful, which is what tipped me off to her maybe not understanding it) and she would apply normal damage for it each time. There was one instance where it was powered up to 10, and it got a hit directly on the opponent. The opponent took 10 and asked her if her turn was over. On multiple occasions (obviously not when the hydra was at 10), it would hit, the player would assign some kind-of-strong blocker, and would ""kill"" the hydra (by ignoring double strike).

When I found out a few hours after the prerelease, I was furious. This happened 5/6 matches, she told me. Only her LAST MATCH, after 4 losses, 1 win, did the opponent deal the right amount of damage from the hydra. She asked why, he told her, and played correctly for the rest of the game, but figured it was too late to tell the judge or anything since the night was over (probably true).

The point is, **really?** This is the kind of thing I heard about happening to Magic newbies, and it's why I originally carried a heavy prejudice against Magic players. I had convinced myself I was all wrong today when I played against some great guys, but after hearing this, the fact that 5 people lied to this new player's face just because they knew they could get away with it? 

I can't even say ""well it was clearly just one bad egg,"" because it was 5 people. 

I don't know what the point of this post is. Part of it is just expressing how completely appalled I am by this skeezy behavior. Maybe I feel like you guys need to know this kind of behavior exists, and you should (if it's reasonable) keep an eye on the games going on beside you if there's a newbie involved. 

It's one thing to not remind an opponent of triggers, but to NOT ACKNOWLEDGE A FUNCTIONALITY OF AN ENTIRE MECHANIC for your own benefit is just complete and utter douchebaggery.

Just so people can stop filling my inbox with ""maybe not all 5 were cheaters,"" yes, I get it.

Hey /r/magictcg,

twotwobearz here. This post isn't anywhere near as exciting as a new Magic set, so you should definitely go click that bold link at the top first. In fact, I'll even link it again right here: [**click me!**](http://www.wizards.com/magic/tcg/article.aspx?x=mtg/tcg/dragonsmaze/cig) Don't worry, I'll wait.

OK, back now? Cool. I just wanted to say something really quick.

As most of you remember, our faithful Spoiler Guy, /u/jestergoblin, retired from compiling spoilers after Gatecrash. Due to the immense amount of work it took to keep a spoiler updated for three straight weeks, Jester took a well-deserved slumber.

To avoid the problem of any one person being burnt out in the future, we devised a brilliant plan: instead of one Spoiler Guy, let's have a Spoiler Team! So we put together a group of volunteers to manage spoilers for Dragon's Maze: /u/HoopyFreud, /u/Acaviae, /u/Amarkov, /u/Wafflecopter42, and /u/RumZ512.

The point of this post is very simple: these guys deserve a huge amount of thanks for all their work. I know they didn't volunteer for this job for the praise (or the non-existent karma), but I'm sure they'd appreciate it nonetheless. Thanks also go out to jestergoblin for continuing to advise us and provide support.

Moving forward, I think the team strategy has been working really well.  While we did get a little behind the ball this past weekend, we're definitely aware of that shortcoming and hope you'll forgive us. To try and alleviate this in the future, we do plan on switching over to a shared account for posting spoilers, so that it's easier for the Spoiler Team to edit and update the daily post as new cards are revealed. (Thanks to the several other redditors who suggested this great idea.)

At the end of the day, compiling spoilers is a lot of different things for different people. It's a way to get around firewalls, a forum for discussion, a place to compile information. For us, it's a service and a labor of love. We're not always perfect, but we try, and we're definitely open to suggestions.

**Why we do this:** /r/magictcg is a great subreddit, and this is our way of doing a service for the community. It's also simply more efficient if all the spoilers are in one place, and manually compiling the text spoilers here helps people who are stuck behind firewalls and other filters. Beyond that, we really enjoy seeing the commentary from this subreddit, and that wouldn't happen if no one did this.

1366958505.0,611,self.magicTCG,1d51ut,"Forget Timmy, Johnny and Spike... this weekend I want to encourage you all to be a ""Max""",Hibernian,798,187,291,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1d51ut/forget_timmy_johnny_and_spike_this_weekend_i_want/,"Who is Max you ask? 

I went for a final GTC draft last weekend before the release of Dragon's Maze and in the final round I faced off against Max. He was playing a Dimir deck that made good use of evasion to punch through damage. I was playing a super consistent Boros deck with triple Wojek Halberdiers and a Boros Reckoner. The winner of the match would get a prize and the loser would not. 

We were both at low health when I swung with everything, triggering two of my Wojek Halberdiers, among other threats. He blocked with something that had lifelink that would have left him alive and in striking distance of killing me back on the next turn to boot. I totally, completely missed that the Halberdiers first strike damage would go off before lifelink, meaning I would kill him as a state based effect between first strike and normal combat damage. 

**Max did not miss this.**

But he didn't try to hide it either. As we're both looking at the board, trying to figure out combat damage, he says ""Six damage from first strike. I should have seen that and blocked one of the Halberdiers. Good game."" 

**So who is Max?**

Max is a guy who did not get angry about his mistake. He did not try to take advantage of my oversight of first strike damage. He was a good sportsman and he played by the rules, even if they didn't favor him. Max is a guy that makes me want to keep going back to that shop, spending money on cards and contributing to the community. Max is the kind of guy I want to play with and against. 

So remember this weekend that YES, this is a tournament and you are there to play to the best of your ability. But be a good guy/gal. Don't try to trick people. Don't try to catch them missing a trigger and then rules lawyer them to your own advantage. This isn't a Pro Tour or a Grand Prix. This is a prerelease, played in a local shop that supports you and provides a place for you to play the game with others. If you are like Max, people will keep coming back. If you are a jerk, people will find other places to play or quit all together. 

Enjoy the prerelease. Play to win. But be kind, considerate and play by the rules. Help the new players who are trying out Magic for the fist time. Don't talk down to people. Shower before you go and don't make a mess of the shop. Be like Max. **Be a ""Good Guy Magic Player""** and try to make the event better for everyone. 


**EDIT**
Lots of responses to this so I want to touch on a few points:

* Yes, I know that being a ""nice guy"" is not the same as a psychographic profile like Timmy, Johnny and Spike. The point of this post was to point your attention towards *other* behaviors associated with going to MtG events apart from your motivation to play. It's about *HOW* you play and interact at the store, rather than *WHY* you are there in the first place. The title wasn't meant to be semantically correct, but to use a creative parallel to make you think about your actions. 
* Yes, Timmy, Johnny and Spike can all still be a Max. Its not exclusionary. Build combo decks and be a nice guy. Get excited about bombs and be a nice guy. Play to win and still be a nice guy. I'm not trying to change your motivation for play. I just wanted to remind people that its beneficial for the game if you are a nice guy while you play. 
* There seems to be a misconception that Max = not playing to win. That is false. Max adheres to the rules. Max isn't a jerk to others. Max is polite and friendly, win or lose. But Max doesn't have to let someone take back an action after the game state has changed. He doesn't have to lay down and let someone walk over him for the sake of being nice. Max just shouldn't making the experience miserable by trying to rules lawyer someone or being a jerk about mistakes. 
* Likewise, I think there's a misconception that being a Spike means you have license to be a dickbag. ""They won't learn anything if I correct their missed triggers!"" is bullshit. That's HOW someone learns. Someone points out the mistake and helps them understand the context of their actions. Wearing a ""Spike Tag"" on your shirt doesn't give you the right to be a douche in the name of winning at all costs. 
* Remember that you are part of a Magic ecosystem. Prerelease events are like breeding season. If you poison the water when all the newborns are figuring out how to stand, there won't be any big game to hunt later. If you act like a jerk and make new players feel cheated or abused, they won't come back to your shop.

I will try to update this post as needed throughout the day. If something new comes up, please post a comment and add it to the thread, along with a source. In the event of a typo, let me know and I'll correct it as soon as I can. These will go up each day throughout the week. On weekends, you're on your own!

**Why I do this:** /r/magictcg is a great subreddit, and this is my way of doing a service for the community. It's also simply more efficient if all the spoilers are in one place, and manually compiling the text spoilers here helps people who are stuck behind firewalls and other filters. I've been there, and it is enraging for people to talk about a card and have no way of reading what it does.

--------------------------

I know almost no one reads this part, but I felt I should state this now: **Gatecrash is going to be my last set of spoilers**. Once the set is completed, I will be stepping down. The last three years have been me handling spoilers and it has been entertaining to say the least.

Since I started this though, both the Magic landscape and my life have changed drastically and while I believe this is a service that must be continued, I cannot do so. I am giving you all time to find a replacement instead of just not showing up. With *five* sets being released a year now, I don't get breaks.

**Why we do this:** there's no reason to have 15 threads with the same subject matter on a subreddit, people get pissed, they miss out on other topics, and sometimes it dilutes a big piece of news itself because there's 15 threads about the same subject with 10 upvotes, instead of 1 with 150 upvotes. This consolidation is both good for us that have too much time on our hands at home, and you guys who want to be able to click near the top of /r/magicTCG and find what you're looking for as well.

Most of you know the drill, but here it is anyway. For the next few weeks, I will sacrifice what is known as ""sleep"" to consolidate all of the spoilers into a single thread that allows for discussion to occur in one place.

So instead of spamming the crap out of this subreddit in regards to everyone trying to claim ""FIRST!!1!"" with the spoilers, we're trying to keep them all together in a single post.

For people who prefer pictures, check out all of today's spoilers [over here](http://castlesandcooks.com/2012/09/05/evidently-return-to-ravnica-wishes-to-keep-spoiling-itself/). 

For a [full text-spoiler of Return to Ravnica](http://mtgsalvation.com/return-to-ravnica-spoiler.html) so far and here is a [visual spoiler](http://castlesandcooks.com/magic-the-gathering-spoilers/return-to-ravnica-visual-spoiler/) of the ones so far.

1. Improper conduct for REL. When you play at FNM stop trying to win at all costs, and instead help a new player out.
2. Trade sharking.
3. The still pervasive underlying current of sexism (and sometimes racism) that continues to exist in game stores.

1370165432.0,569,self.magicTCG,1figdt,"Sydney, Australia had a PTQ today. It was the worst-run PTQ I have ever heard of or attended.",inverselychivalrous,715,146,231,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1figdt/sydney_australia_had_a_ptq_today_it_was_the/,"This past weekend was a double-header WMCQ and PTQ for Sydney. With only one or two GPs in Australia or New Zealand each year, we rely on our PTQs and once-a-year WMCQ for competitive Magic. It's not uncommon for players from around Australia to travel for the events.

This year, the WMCQ and PTQ weekend was given to a chain of stores called [Good Games](www.goodgames.com.au). They're the largest chain of gaming stores in Australia, and this tends to result in an attitude of being ""untouchable"".

Some Good Games stores are Core, and some are Advanced. The events this weekend were awarded to [Good Games Central](http://www.goodgames.com.au/stores/nsw/sydney-central.html), an Advanced store and the ""flagship"" store for the chain.

The WMCQ was held on Saturday, the 1st of June. It was held [a good 20+ kilometres away from Good Games Central](http://goo.gl/maps/ngS0I), in a suburb renowned for being unsavoury and unsafe, particularly late at night after a WMCQ Top 8. For reference, [a man was shot in broad daylight on the morning of the event](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/man-in-serious-condition-after-shooting-20130601-2niye.html) less than 5 minutes away from the venue. Concerns about the distance of the venue from the physical location of the host and the Sydney CBD were raised a month before the event, but not addressed by the TO.

Other than that, the understaffed (4 for a 100+ person tournament); underpaid; and on the part of a brand-new un-uniformed L1, underqualified; Judge staff did their best to keep the tournament running smoothly. 

The fact that several hundred people qualified for the WMCQ, yet only a hundred or so attended (almost no inter-state travellers) went ignored by the TO.

Today, however, the real hell began. The PTQ was also hosted by Good Games Central, but the venue for the second day of a double-header weekend was not the same as for the previous day. The venue chosen was Good Games Hurstville, [a good 15 kilometres away from Good Games Central](http://goo.gl/maps/AOFei), let alone at ***an entirely different store***, and one that was not Advanced level at the time applications for the events opened (and thus should never have had the chance to be anywhere near running a PTQ). A month before the weekend, venues closer to the city and closer to the actual host of the event still had 200-300 capacity rooms available for full-weekend hire - the only limiting factor being the higher costs that Good Games Central was unwilling to pay.

The total attendance for the PTQ was 144. The play-space at Good Games Hurstville could apparently sit ""100"". You can immediately see the problem. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/LGnMuL9.jpg) is a picture of the degree to which the players were compacted into space. Instead of the standard two games per table, there were three and a half. It was impossible to not be in physical contact with another player. The venue did not have enough chairs for every player. They literally had no way to cater for an amount of players that was smaller than every other PTQ so far this year, at an event in Australia's largest city.

**[The space issue was so bad that players were playing in the café next door](http://i.imgur.com/y3AKjVd.jpg).** Everyone in that image was a player or spectator at the tournament. The solution that the TO thought was appropriate for the issue with not being able to spare one of the Judges into the separate building was ***TO POST A SIGN IN THE CAFÉ WINDOW WITH A JUDGE'S PHONE NUMBER. Yes***, some paying players of Sydney's only PTQ for PT Theros had to ring if they wanted or needed a Judge. If Good Games Central had been willing to hire more than 4 Judges for the weekend, as they were told they should *a month in advance*, they would have not had that problem.

As far as anecdotal accounts go, the owner and operator of Good Games Hurstville was reportedly ""amused"" and ""laughing"" when players found it more comfortable to stand outside in Sydney Winter rain that inside the jam-packed store. 

The reason I'm posting this is that Good Games as an entity has completely ceased any kind of communication with the upset player-base, and are operating in a manner characteristic with their previous ""untouchable"" attitude. My opinion (and the opinion of most people I talked to after the event, including the Judges) is that we should all make an effort to ensure that the largest possible amount of people hear about the atrocity that was the horribly-managed, and under-attended as a result, event that Good Games ran today, so that Good Games is unable to avoid consequence for how badly they treated competitive Magic in Sydney, their own Judge staff and all the players at their events.

If you have a similar story of your horrible experience with a PTQ/WMCQ, I'd love to hear how you resolved it, and what consequences the TO faced from WotC as a result.",,False,,t5_2qn5f,1370167632.0,,,True,t3_1figdt,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1figdt/sydney_australia_had_a_ptq_today_it_was_the/,

He got a response from Wizards and they have sent a 45lb box of assorted goodies for free, which really helps the morale around here. Knowing that once a week we can gather and play a fun game of Magic and get free goodies (card sleeves/t shirts/deck boxes/decks/booster packs.) 

I am really appreciative of Wizards and I wanted others to know about it. Pictures of the goodies are below.

1370325554.0,555,self.magicTCG,1fmwo3,Gamers United - An Apology,GamersUnitedShop,706,151,374,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1fmwo3/gamers_united_an_apology/,"As I'm sure most of you are aware, we recently came under fire across the internet for our decision to increase the price of our pre-orders of Modern Masters.  We wish we could have commented on this sooner, but could not until we had spoken with WotC about this ordeal, and that would definitely mean staying quiet over the weekend.  

Short Story:  We've rescinded all price increases on our pre-ordered Modern Masters, and will not be cancelling the pre-orders we have received.  We've also apologized to the customers involved as we, as gamers, felt that our course of action was not the correct one at the time.

Long Story:

The situation was this:  we realized a little too late that we'd vastly under-priced our stock of Modern Masters, and severely over-estimated how much we'd have in stock.  While we could've cancelled the pending orders outright and refunded the money, we decided instead to offer the customers who had pre-ordered MM priority on the stock that we would be getting, as, in a sense, we felt they had ""first dibs"".

In this, we were wrong.

Not only was it wrong, but upon review of the hastily written email, it appeared as though we were holding their product hostage, demanding a ransom.  That wasn't our intention, but to be honest, we approached the entire situation from the wrong angle.  We looked at it as Businessmen, but, as you may have heard, We Are Gamers.

Over the weekend we discussed our options internally, but made a decision to clear everything with Wizards before we moved forward.  After all, if we violate their policy, we can't provide their product to anyone, and we wouldn't really be that great of a gaming store regardless of other circumstances if that were the case. 

Wizards confirmed today that we had violated none of their guidelines, but did remind us that they recommended not allowing the product for pre-order.  Whoops.

So we discussed it a bit more, and approached it as we should have been approaching it from the beginning.  We are Gamers, and how exactly would we feel if this happened to us?  The solution then couldn't have been clearer.

We contacted the customers we previously sent the emails to detailing the price increase and alerted them that this would not, actually, be the case.  Even though we'd violated none of WotC's guidelines and were essentially in the clear, their orders would be honored as they were made, as they should have been from the beginning.  Our panic over the limited stock had blinded us to the fact that they too, are Gamers.  

Again, to those who pre-ordered, we're sorry for this error, we admit we initially handled the situation extremely poorly, and hope you enjoy your boxes when they arrive next week!

This has certainly been a learning experience for us, and while I cannot promise we will never again make a mistake, a mistake exactly like this one will never again be made.  To ensure this, we're making the following changes:

1.  We will not sell conservative print run items on our website.  As a small store, we have to think about our local community first.  We apologize ahead of time for the inconvenience to our online customers.

2.  We will be far more diligent when it comes to our online sales.  We freely admit this is an issue that should have been noticed and dealt with months ago, and in the event of website mistakes in the future, refunds will be issued immediately, not months later.

3.  We will continue to view our customers as Gamers, and, again, remember that We Are Gamers.  An extension of the golden rule, treat other Gamers as we would also like to be treated.

4.  We will update our online sales policy, to more accurately reflect all of the above items.

5.  We will continue to extend our outreach among distributors, to ensure that in the future, when a product is released we have adequate supply to satisfy both our local community and any online sales.

We would like to apologize to the community as a whole as well, again for our lack of communication.  We didn't want to make any further missteps until we knew, without a doubt, how we wanted to proceed.  We hope that you agree that in the end, we made the right decision.

“All men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride.”

― Sophocles, Antigone

I ordered them at 140 a box. I was super excited by this deal, but I did it on March 14th. Way before all the excitement began. I paid them ahead of time, and everything. Even got an email confirming my order and saying it would ship as soon as it became available.

So now the warning part. I just got an email from them saying the price was 289.99 a box and that if I wanted my order shipped I would need to pay the difference. This is more than what my local game stores charged but I didn't order from them because I thought I had plenty coming. But they didn't charge enough so now they want to go back 2 months on a preorder and charge me the difference. I feel this is a TERRIBLE business practice and I urge all of you to know what kind of outfit they are.

TL/DR Gamers United Shop presold MM at $140 a box, and now want to charge me the difference between that and the $290 they currently sell them at.

Edit** Thank you for the advice I did contact Wizards. Also I made this post so that other people would know what kind of company gamers united is, not to bemoan my misfortunes. When I found the deal I looked at the site and it looked legit, not amazing but neither is my LGS's. And I did a search to see if they had any history of misdealing with their customers and I couldn't find anything.

Since /u/jestergoblin is away, I have temporarily taken up his mantle of compiling spoilers! Note that I receive no karma for this self post.

Instead of spamming the crap out of this subreddit in regards to everyone trying to claim ""FIRST!!1!"" with the spoilers, we're trying to keep them all together in a single post. This will consolidate all of the spoilers into a single thread that allows for discussion to occur in one place.

**Why I do this:** /r/magictcg is a great subreddit, and this is my way of doing a service for the community.

1334011623.0,517,self.magicTCG,s1jvl,ANNOUNCEMENT: Flair coming soon,TheCid,675,158,337,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/s1jvl/announcement_flair_coming_soon/,"(This self-post gives me no karma. Please upvote so that this will be seen by as many people as possible. If you're one of the moderators of this subreddit, check your modmail if you haven't already.)

We've been in discussion with a WotC representative regarding the use of their symbols and icons on this subreddit. We're very close to getting everything set up, and hopefully by the end of the week we'll have flair available, plus maybe some other stuff.

However, there's a bit of a tradeoff. WotC's got some restrictions on how we can use this stuff.

This means that the subreddit is going to officially enforce certain rules beyond that which reddit requires us to enforce (""no personal information"", that kind of thing). 

The two main points are as follows:

* Wizards of the Coast forbids unofficial spoilers. 

While we are not required to forbid links to external sites with unofficial spoilers, we will **not** accept the cards here. If you acquire cards from a new set early, do **not** spoil the cards here. We cannot allow r/magictcg to be a go-to place for people to leak unofficial spoilers. 

Again, you can link to a spoiler site that has unofficial spoilers - that's fine - but we cannot be the site to spoil the cards for the first time.

We ARE allowed to ""report"" on unofficial spoilers. This means that we can in fact copy spoiler text into reddit comments.

* Wizards of the Coast straight-up forbids certain kinds of content. I'm just going to paste straight out of their legalese:

&gt; However, we cannot allow Wizards Materials be used on any Fan Site that promotes sexually explicit materials, violence, discrimination or illegal activities, or makes disparaging, libelous or dishonest statements about Wizards and/or its products, employees and agents.

Some of you are probably thinking that certain other subreddits violate this policy - don't worry about that. The ""Fan Site"" is r/magictcg, not reddit as a whole. Anything that runs afoul of this policy will be removed going forward. There hasn't been very much of this before, and I doubt that this will make much of a difference.

In keeping with reddit's longstanding tradition of free speech, these restrictions will be interpreted in a manner which avoids censorship to the best of our ability. We will *not* be removing posts simply because they say a card or set is bad, so don't think that this subreddit will turn into MTG Salvation-style ""EVERY CARD IS THE BEST CARD EVER PRINTED!!!!111one"" inanity.

As a result of this, we'll be tweaking the CSS over the next couple of days, so if things look weird for a bit, that's why.

----

TL;DR: 

* Don't leak cards on r/magictcg
* Don't promote porn, racism, sexism, or illegal activity
* Don't commit libel against WotC and their products/employees/agents

--- 

BONUS:

We'll be looking for a new header image soon, to replace the stopgap I threw up to replace the one that got put up last week before we actually hashed everything out. (We apologize for the confusion there, by the way.) Once we have everything set in terms of what we can and can't do, we'll set the parameters and let people submit proposed images to us.

UPDATE:

I was reading things in an overly strict manner when I set the initial spoiler policy. Please read the revised text.

SECOND UPDATE:

This is not an irreversible decision, and this is not a decree of censorship. I really don't expect us to be removing noticeably more posts than we've been removing in the past. As far as I know, we've never had someone leak an unofficial spoiler to r/magictcg before, and all we're doing is saying that we won't let that start.

We are not going to be removing legitimate criticism of Wizards, cards, sets, or events. If something like that happens, reddit's longstanding tradition of free speech will win out.

This decision does not make us an ""official"" Wizards site. We're still unaffiliated with Wizards - they just grant fan sites the ability to use their intellectual property with some restrictions.(One of them, for instance, is that we can't make our website look like theirs.)

This guy was 12 years old whom I will call Jim. (I say guy because he certainly did not behave like a kid.). I did end up beating him in game 3, which was a tough situation because we were both 5-1 going into this round. Instead of getting frustrated and angry, Jim started asking me all sorts of questions about our match up and what he should be playing around if he plays another deck like mine. He congratulated me, and with his head held high shook my hand and wished me good in the rest of the tournament. I ended up going x-1 and broke into top 8, but Jim lost every round afterwards. Instead of being deflated (which tbh I would have been after starting out so strong and not getting top 8), Jim stood by and watched every one of games after he dropped from the tournament.

&gt;So here’s what happened. Originally, some of the maze runners (aka guild champions) were rare and some were mythic rare. They couldn’t all be mythic rare because we only had nine mythic rare slots. Ral Zarek, a planeswalker, had already taken up the tenth slot. (Planeswalkers for complexity and specialness reasons need to be mythic rare.) 

&gt;We talked about Ral just being the Izzet representative but decided that for numerous purposes (Commander being one of the biggest) we wanted a blue/red legendary creature and thus an Izzet maze runner. 

&gt;It was decided well into development that the maze runners should all be the same rarity which meant they had to be rare as mythic rare wasn’t possible. This resulted in us making some changes to turn the mythic rare maze runners into rare maze runners. 

&gt;**One of those swaps was Voice of Resurgence with Emmara. As many have guessed, Emmara originally made the X/X token (seen in the background of her art). It wasn’t a straight swap and there was lots of massaging of both cards. That is what happened.**

Anyhow....

My son turned 11 in November.  His mother and I split up almost 2 years ago, and it has really affected him negatively.  Then my eldest (he is 22) introduced Jr. to MTG.  Jr absolutely LOVES the game.  Him &amp; I played all last summer.  I picked up like 7000 commons and uncommons from eBay for less than $100 so we could build decks. It is something that has really helped him to focus.  

So for his 11th birthday, I knew I wanted him to have an MTG theme.  He was at his moms on his actual birthday, but that just gave me more time to prep.  I bought a few pre-con decks for him.  A bunch of Pro-Fit sleeves, some deck boxes, counters, dice, etc...  But the talk of the table was the cake.  It was a simple red velvet cake, but I had one of those art-work transfers made, of a proxy card I whipped up.  

VERY easily one of the best and most memorable birthdays he has had in his 11 years on this rock.

Here's the deal, instead of spamming the crap out of this subreddit in regards to everyone trying to claim ""FIRST!!1!"" with the spoilers, we're trying to keep them all together in a single post. This will consolidate all of the spoilers into a single thread that allows for discussion to occur in one place. Brushwagg is my favorite creature type.

I will try to update this post as needed throughout the day. If something new comes up, please post a comment and add it to the thread, along with a source. In the event of a typo, let me know and I'll correct it as soon as I can. These will go up each day throughout the week. On weekends, you're on your own!

**Why I do this:** /r/magictcg is a great subreddit, and this is my way of doing a service for the community. It's also simply more efficient if all the spoilers are in one place, and manually compiling the text spoilers here helps people who are stuck behind firewalls and other filters. I've been there, and it is enraging for people to talk about a card and have no way of reading what it does. So if one more person asks why I don't just link to one of those sites, I will publicly shame them.

*Originally posted on 1/8*

&gt;I know almost no one reads this part, but I felt I should state this now: **Gatecrash is going to be my last set of spoilers**. Once the set is completed, I will be stepping down. The last three years have been me handling spoilers and it has been entertaining to say the least.

&gt;Since I started this though, both the Magic landscape and my life have changed drastically and while I believe this is a service that must be continued, I cannot do so. I am giving you all time to find a replacement instead of just not showing up. With *five* sets being released a year now, I don't get breaks. I'm beyond burned out and almost didn't come back for this season after Return to Ravnica. I'm not going away, I just plan on slumbering for a long, long time.

I will try to update this post as needed throughout the day. If something new comes up, please post a comment and add it to the thread, along with a source. In the event of a typo, let me know and I'll correct it as soon as I can. These will go up each day throughout the week. On weekends, you're on your own!

**Why I do this:** /r/magictcg is a great subreddit, and this is my way of doing a service for the community. It's also simply more efficient if all the spoilers are in one place, and manually compiling the text spoilers here helps people who are stuck behind firewalls and other filters. I've been there, and it is enraging for people to talk about a card and have no way of reading what it does. So if one more person asks why I don't just link to one of those sites, I will publicly shame them.

*Originally posted on 1/8*

&gt;I know almost no one reads this part, but I felt I should state this now: **Gatecrash is going to be my last set of spoilers**. Once the set is completed, I will be stepping down. The last three years have been me handling spoilers and it has been entertaining to say the least.

&gt;Since I started this though, both the Magic landscape and my life have changed drastically and while I believe this is a service that must be continued, I cannot do so. I am giving you all time to find a replacement instead of just not showing up. With *five* sets being released a year now, I don't get breaks. I'm beyond burned out and almost didn't come back for this season after Return to Ravnica. I'm not going away, I just plan on slumbering for a long, long time.

Now, don't misunderstand - a lot of people here will help you - but a lot of people get tired of repeating themselves too. :)

So, please, before you post up a decklist asking for help, do these things:

1. Fix your manabase. Get the whatever Innistrad taplands, core set taplands, and shocklands you need to run the deck you're trying to play. If you're playing a RB Zombies deck, you NEED 4 Blood Crypts and 4 Dragonskull Summit. No, those Rakdos Guildgates are not good enough, nor are those Evolving Wilds. If you want to be a serious Standard player, first thing you need to do, every time a new set comes out, is get playsets of the lands. 

2. Cut to 60 cards. Not 65, not 61. SIXTY. The rule of thumb for what to cut works like this: If you want it every single game, in multiples, and in your opening hand, run four (general example: Rancor). If you want to see it every single game, run three (general example: Liliana of the Veil). If you need it once in a while, situationally, run two (general example: Ultimate Price). If it's something with a very narrow focus, or isn't always usable, or is either of those plus super expensive, run one (general example: Niv Mizzet, Dracogenius).

3. Do your research. Go here, and use the Deck Database: http://www.starcitygames.com/pages/decks.php  Look up decks similar to what you're trying to do, and remember, those decks are winning tournaments and you are not. Clearly, their ideas are better than yours when it comes to competitive decks, so if they're running four Strangleroot Geists and you're running Worldspine Wurm, just assume they do, in fact, know better. At the very least, try it their way first, and keep an open mind - you want to improve! 

4. When someone suggests you get a certain card(s), don't cry poverty. We all have budgetary limitations, but part of being able to win is not shooting yourself in the foot by playing sub-optimal cards. Azorius Guildgates are NOT the same as Hallowed Fountains. Cloudshift is NOT as efficient as Restoration Angel. Even if you don't have the money, you should know what you need, and always be trying to trade for that stuff. If you have to, make some substitutions for the time being, but remember that they're temporary, not permanent, substitutions.

5. Resist the urge to buy packs. Once you start getting in the top 4 of your local tournaments, you'll get plenty of packs as prizes, so for now, buy singles. Also, you can go on eBay and buy playsets of every common and uncommon in a set for $30-$40. That's well worth it to not have to worry about whether or not you have four Blood Artists the day you're putting your deck together. When a new set drops, yeah, grab a box, and buy a commons+uncommons playset. Then use the stuff from the box to trade for rares you need. But after that first box, just buy the singles. I know, ripping packs is fun, but let's say you've got $25 to spend. That'll get you six or seven packs of RTR. Maybe you pull something awesome - but probably not. Right now, you can go on eBay, and for $25 shipped, you can get a playset of BOTH Dragonskull Summit AND Sunpetal Grove (in Chinese, no less). What's going to make you happier, spending $25 on a pile of random jank from packs, or buying a significant portion of your manabase? You can go on eBay and buy two foil pre-release Restoration Angels for $25 shipped. You can get a Thragtusk and a playset of Korean Rancors for $25. Please think about it, and tell me what you were going to pull from six packs of RTR that is better than eight taplands, or two foil resto angels, or a Thragtusk and a set of pimp Rancors. See?

Please, next time you want to post up a decklist and ask for help doing better in tournaments, remember this stuff first. 

Then, if you're doing all this stuff already, come on over to /r/spikes and post your decklist there. :)

tl;dr: Want help winning? Stop durdling around and fix yourself first!

1358711081.0,477,self.magicTCG,16xz9o,"Vintage, A primer",WolfPacLeader,546,69,149,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/16xz9o/vintage_a_primer/,"I’ve seen quite a bit of misinformation on the rare occasion that Vintage comes up on this subreddit.  I received some positive responses yesterday when I asked if people would like a primer on Vintage.

Ok, first of all Vintage is not like any other format at all.  It is NOT just legacy with the power 9 added.  Legacy is more similar to modern in how it plays than it is to vintage.  Vintage is an entirely new form of MTG, and in my opinion, the most fun.  Another misconception about Vintage is that whoever goes first wins.  While being on the play is possibly more important in vintage than any other format, it is very possible to win on the draw.  Turn 1 wins happen, but they are NOT the norm.  Yes, vintage players have access to all of the most broken combos ever printed in MTG, but they also have access to the best hate cards ever printed, so it balances out somewhat.

Vintage decks:

When talking about vintage, there are generally speaking 5 kinds of decks.  This does not mean that there are only 5 decks in the format, but rather every deck can be classified into one of these 5 categories.  These categories are generally described as “Pillars,” and are named after cards which are integral to the strategies of these decks.  

The five pillars are:

1.	Mana drain
2.	Mishra’s Workshop
3.	Bazaar of Baghdad
4.	Dark Ritual
5.	Null Rod

Decks in the Mana Drain pillar are control decks, generally speaking with some kind of combo finish, such as Time Vault/Voltaic Key, or Tinker/Blightsteel Colossus.  These decks are basically the control deck that you always wish you had.  They can kill very fast, do a great job of shutting down opponents, and are hard to hate out.  Mirror matchups between decks in this pillar can be very long drawn out games, although sometimes those games can be fairly quick.

There are plenty of decks which fit into this archtype and are quite varied:

Jace Control: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11919#166557

Oath: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11919#166554

Bomberman: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11919#166555

Gush Storm: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11224#155927

Note, these decks aren’t all running 4x mana drain, but they still fall under the Mana drain pillar.

Decks in the next two pillars probably have the least variety in them.  Mishra’s Workshop based decks almost always are controlling decks whose goal is to prevent their opponent from every casting anything.  They do this by abusing lands which add more than 1 mana to their mana pool, chiefly Mishra’s Workshop, but also Ancient Tomb and sometimes City of Traitors.  In addition, these decks also run Wastelands in order to kill any nonbasics that their opponents play.  These decks run some win conditions such as Lodestone Golem or Karn, Silver Golem, but the bread and butter of this deck are spheres, named after Sphere of Resistance, and also including Thorn of Amethyst, Lodestone Golem, and Trinisphere(which is restricted).  These decks also run a myriad of obnoxious cards, such as Chalice of the Void, Smokestack, and Tanglewire.

MUD list: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11224#155924

Decks in the Bazaar of Baghdad pillar, or Dredge decks, are the best unhated decks in the history of MTG.   In game 1, dredge decks will normally win on turn 2 or 3, and this is probably where a lot of the misconception about vintage comes from.  The deck works by getting a ton of cards into the graveyard with Bazaar of Baghdad and dredgers such as Golgari Grave Troll and Stinkweed Imp, and then, after removing their opponents hand with the flashback of Cabal therapy, reanimate a big threat such as Sun Titan or Flame-kin zealot and swing with 20 zombies made from Bridge from Below and sacking Narcomoebas and Bloodghasts to Cabal Therapy and Dread Returns flashback costs.  In addition to the combo dredge deck I just described, there are decks which do not run Dread Return and instead focus on beating down with Ichorid’s and zombie tokens.  Normally decks run a combination of both.

Dredge decklist:  http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11919#166552

Decks in the Dark Ritual pillar are almost always storm decks of some kind.  The decks play fairly similar to storm decks in other formats, just better.  I don’t have that much to say about this pillar, but most MTG players should understand what a storm deck is.

TPS decklist: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11903#166450

Decks in the Null Rod pillar are decks that everyone should be familiar with, as they don’t look very different from decks in other formats.  These decks actually don’t run Null Rod anymore, preferring the harder to kill replacement, Stony Silence.  These decks are basically creature based aggro, except almost all of their creatures are disruptive, such as Gaddock Teeg, Qasali Pridemage, Meddling Mage, or Trygon Predator, among others.  There are basically 2 types of decks, fish and hatebears.  The only real difference is that fish runs blue for counterspells, Force of Will in particular, and hatebears does not.

Fish decklist:  http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11918#166543

Hatebears decklist: http://www.mtgpulse.com/event/11330#157547

Hopefully this has helped give those of you who needed it a bit of understanding about MTG's most powerful format.  If you have any questions please feel free to ask.

Edit:  I didn't mention this in my post, but pvtmiller sums up the price issue nicely.

&gt; the advantage of vintage is that pretty much every vintage tournament will allow some number of proxies, and when you remove all the moxen and black lotus from the cost of the deck, the decks drop into legacy price ranges.

(http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/yzm41/for_every_50_upvotes_this_post_gets_rfg_will_be/)

It was a post where a store promised to give away a pack of round cornered sleeves for every 50 upvotes the post got. It is currently still number five on the ""top rated of all time"" for this subreddit and sat in the number one place for quite a while. People from /r/all were showing up confused because it hit the front page. 

There are rules of Reddit that all subreddits are bound to. (http://www.reddit.com/rules) and one of them is:

&gt;""Don't ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation.""

One of the examples is:

&gt; NOT OK: Creating submissions such as ""For every upvote I will ..."" or ""... please upvote this!"", regardless of the cause.

So I was pretty dissappointed when I woke up today to see this post on the number one spot of the front page:

&gt; [Hiya MagicTCG. You guys make up a pretty awesome community and I would like to giveaway some gold.](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1c9kxa/hiya_magictcg_you_guys_make_up_a_pretty_awesome/)

Here are some segments from the body of the post:

&gt; This post must get at least 15 upvotes for me to giveaway prizes! I don't get Karma. I jus want others to see this.
15=1 prize
30= 2
50= 3

Here's another one:

&gt; Sometime tonight (EST) I will use my handy dandy MTG app to get a random card from gatherer. Whoever has that card gets the gold. If no one has that card I'll keep going until I find one. I'll do this up to three times **depending on how much attention this post gets.**

This is clear solicitation of votes for prizes. You may be asking why it's a problem, it's a self post not promoting anything right? Well besides the desire to see our subreddit not cluttered with contests, and it being against the rules, let me explain why this is a bad practice to allow.

Let's say this guy promised to give away Reddit gold, what's to stop him from waiting until it sits firmly on the front page, and then editing the entire post so that there is no text other than a single Referral Marketing link? Now people show up to the subreddit confused as to why this post of only a link it on the front page and follow the link. Now if it's something such as an affiliate link to greenmangaming.com, you now have a cookie on your browser, and for the next month or so every time you buy something there he gets a cut. The mods would surely remove this, but not before hundreds (or even thousands) of users followed the link, keep in mind this costs the OP **literally nothing** to do, and guarantees at least a few hundred suckers follow the referral link.

**This allows people to monetize this subreddit at no risk to themselves**.

Please mods, this is what you're here for, if a post violates the rules of Reddit, your job is to remove it. 


**UPDATE**: Looks like the post has now been removed in under a half an hour of this post going up. Thank you mods. I know it's hard to delete a post that has gotten a large number of comments, but it sometimes needs to be done, and I'm glad you did it.

**EDIT**: I want to clarify that I'm not trying to say the moderators are doing a bad job. There are **53,000** people on this subreddit and **10** moderators. That means there are over **FIVE-THOUSAND** subscribed users to each moderator. The fact that I had to go back seven months to find another example of a post abusing the rules like this one attests to the fact that they do an excellent job for the most part. The point of this post is just to hammer down the reasons why these types of posts shouldn't be tolerated. As a userbase we need to meet the moderators half way, if you see a post soliciting votes like this in the future, please don't upvote it.",,False,,t5_2qn5f,1365881000.0,,,True,t3_1ca1cx,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1ca1cx/state_of_the_subreddit_would_the_mods_please_stop/,

**Why I do this:** /r/magictcg is a great subreddit, and this is my way of doing a service for the community. It's also simply more efficient if all the spoilers are in one place, and manually compiling the text spoilers here helps people who are stuck behind firewalls and other filters. I've been there, and it is enraging for people to talk about a card and have no way of reading what it does.

--------------------------

*Originally posted on 1/8*

&gt;I know almost no one reads this part, but I felt I should state this now: **Gatecrash is going to be my last set of spoilers**. Once the set is completed, I will be stepping down. The last three years have been me handling spoilers and it has been entertaining to say the least.

&gt;Since I started this though, both the Magic landscape and my life have changed drastically and while I believe this is a service that must be continued, I cannot do so. I am giving you all time to find a replacement instead of just not showing up. With *five* sets being released a year now, I don't get breaks. I'm beyond burned out and almost didn't come back for this season after Return to Ravnica. I'm not going away, I just plan on slumbering for a long, long time.

&gt;I know almost no one reads this part, but I felt I should state this now: **Gatecrash is going to be my last set of spoilers**. Once the set is completed, I will be stepping down. The last three years have been me handling spoilers and it has been entertaining to say the least.

&gt;Since I started this though, both the Magic landscape and my life have changed drastically and while I believe this is a service that must be continued, I cannot do so. I am giving you all time to find a replacement instead of just not showing up. With *five* sets being released a year now, I don't get breaks. I'm beyond burned out and almost didn't come back for this season after Return to Ravnica. I'm not going away, I just plan on slumbering for a long, long time.

Thanks for your questions everyone - this was a lot of fun.  I'll likely check in with follow ups for a while still.

Hey all - for those of you who don't know me, I'm Brian Kibler.  I've been playing Magic for over eighteen years now, and in that time have had sufficient success on the Pro Tour that people decided to give me a shiny Hall of Fame ring.  

Playing competitive Magic also led me to my current ""real job"" as a game designer.  In the past I've worked on VS System, WoW TCG, Quickstrike, Chaotic, and other games.  Currently, I'm part of the team that makes the Ascension deckbuilding game, and recently announced our new project - SolForge - which you can learn more about (and contribute to the creation of) here:  http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1965800643/solforge-digital-trading-card-game

I'm happy to answer questions about any of these things or whatever else you might be interested in.  I'm going to take questions until about noon PST tomorrow (Friday August 3rd), and then I'll dive in and start answering.  

So ask away!

Figured there might be one or two things you hadn't thought about before:

*Snacks and drinks are nice.* Unless we have an assistant, we're usually stuck behind our table at all times. So we tend to get thirsty and hungry. A little snack or a drink would be very, very welcome. Even a fresh bottle of water would be great.

*Tipping for signing will make us love you.* As for how much to tip... it depends. A buck or two is good. A $5 bill is wonderful. More and you're just telling us how much you love our art and want to support us. I had a guy get 150~ cards signed and tipped $10. The guy behind him had four cards but was feeling generous and tipped $20. So it varies a lot. But just know that we really, really appreciate people who do this. The friendlier our fans are the more likely we are to attend more events.

*If you're getting stuff signed, _please_ take it out of the sleeves/binder/etc. ahead of time.* Especially if there's a line, we'd rather not take that time to remove your cards from their sleeves. Just pull them ahead of time and make both of our lives easier. The best thing you can do is hand me a little stack of unsleeved cards.

*Afternoons are slow.* If you want to chat with us, try to come over in the afternoon. Mornings tend to be insane and crazy. We love chatting, but it's a lot easier for me in the afternoon usually.

*Don't be shy!* Don't hesitate to come over and hang out. We don't bite. Unless you're into that.

*Please keep drinks off of our table.* Please, please, please. Not because I think you're going to spill it, but it terrifies me when your drink is precariously looming over all of my cards and mats. And it's very hard to sell a stained playmat.

*If you're getting a sketch done, you might get a better one if you leave for a little while.* If you're staying there, I'll take as long as it takes to finish the sketch. If you're not around and I don't have a lot to do, I'll keep working on it for much, much longer. That said, I don't mind if you stick around and watch.

We often ran magic events two days a week, + lots of weekend events.  We sold all of the product we could, at fair prices.  We offered free drinks and food to the occasional customer.  We price matched online prices.  We did everything we could at these 3 different stores to keep the doors open, keep the customers happy, and try to still make a small profit.

The closing of these 3 stores all have their different reasons.  The first one closed in part due to the death of one of the partners.  The second due to health reasons of the owner.  The third due to mismanagement and labor issues.  These are the overall final straws that broke the backs of these stores, but they are not the reason they closed.

The underlying factor to all 3 of these stores closing is pretty simple;  People don't spend very much money locally.  Its true, and its sad.

Magic is an expensive game.  We all know that.  We need to save a buck or two when we can.  Getting our boxes online for 10 or 20 dollars cheaper makes sense.  Getting our singles online because they're cheaper from Ebay adds up.

But that extra 10% markup, or 20% markup is what paid for the table you sit at when you play.  That extra markup pays to keep the lights on.  It pays to keep the computer they keep the scores on.  It pays for the internet access they need to upload those scores.  It pays for the comfortable air that surrounds you while you play.  It pays to keep the doors open.

Hell, for some few stores across the country, it even pays the owner a little bit of pocket change he can take home to his family.  But, lets not go wishing for the impossible here ;)

What I'm trying to say is this;  If you have a local gaming store, and you like it... why not this week and every week spend a little money there?  Maybe you COULD update the sleeves on your deck.  Maybe you COULD grab those singles for EDH.  Maybe you would like to try that event deck.  Maybe the next time you're hungry/thirsty maybe you can get your food/drinks from your venue and not the resturant next door.

I know this is old hat.  I know what you're thinking... ""Three stores in six years?  You must be a shitty T.O."" and ya know what?  you might be right.  

But if you're thinking ""It won't happen to my LGS"".  Think again.  When we closed this last friday and we announced it to the room full of 25 FNM'ers the look on their face was unanimous.  It was shock.  no one saw it coming.  I bet you won't see it coming until you see the doors close on your LGS either.

So please, buy local;  Support your gaming store;  and support the game you love :)",,False,,t5_2qn5f,False,,,True,t3_zciuw,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/zciuw/i_am_a_tournament_organizer_for_6_years_and/,

 So it's saturday morning and I wake up feeling good, gonna have some fun and chill at the pre-release, so I do all my shit and head off to the store, the first thing I thought was odd was that my store was charging 30 bucks for entry (I thought it was only going to be 20) 
but whatever I mean whats 10 extra bucks? So I find my friend who I was meeting there and we sit down to play some standard untill the event starts, now where we played our game was right next to the back room so we could kinda see what was going on, the store owner and employees were opening the helvault being very carful about popping the seals off, once they got it open they took out a packet of cards (which I thought were the tokens) and re-sealed the helvault by putting the stickers back on. Now I know that the store wasn't supposed to do that but I mean it was just a few tokens right? Wrong, the next thing we see/hear are people yelling in the main room, so naturally we go into check, people are literally bidding on the judge promos from the vault, I thought that was BS so I got a re-fund and left.

Is there anyway I can contact wizards to report my store?

Brethren and sistren, the reading for the day is from [the Magic Tournament Rules](http://www.wizards.com/wpn/Document.aspx?x=Magic_The_Gathering_Tournament_Rules). Section 7.5, ""Sealed Deck Swap"". And lo, the DCI said:

&gt; In Sealed Deck tournaments, the Head Judge may require players to perform a deck swap prior to deck construction. Players receive unopened product and register the contents (except non-foil basic land cards) on decklists. Foil basic land cards must be registered and kept with the registered card pool. Any card in a booster that is not a card from the expansion of the opened booster is retained by the player that registers the cards (e.g., a player that registers the contents of a booster during a deck swap keeps the token card, if any). **Players who drop from the tournament before fulfilling this duty will receive a match loss in the first round.** Tournament officials then collect the recorded card pools and redistribute them randomly. A player may randomly receive the product he or she registered. The Head Judge should require players to sort the cards they register according to some criteria (e.g. by color and then alphabetically) to assist the player receiving the pool.

Notice that line in bold: if you drop before swapping, you lose your round-one match. And... that's it.

You do *not* get disqualified for theft.

You do *not* get your cards confiscated.

You do *not* get the police called on you.

You do *not* get banned by the DCI.

You just... go on your merry way with your cards, you're recorded as losing in round one, and that's the end of the story.

This is not Theft of Tournament Materials; that infraction has a clear definition, and ""dropping before a sealed deck swap"" is not part of that definition.

It is possible you will run into someone who quotes a line about cards belonging to the Tournament Organizer until the end of the tournament. For that, let us turn back two sections in the Tournament Rules, to section 7.3, where we find that line. Two important things about it:

1. It appears in a standalone paragraph about procedures for tournaments where the organizer allows players to bring their own packs with them.
2. The *full* line is: ""Players are not considered to own the cards until the tournament finishes **or they legally drop.**""

And we already know, from section 7.5, that you can legally drop before the swap happens. So even by the strictest possible reading of this line -- which is to say, assuming that it was just bizarrely placed in a paragraph about a weird unusual procedure, despite actually applying to all tournaments even if they don't use that procedure -- the cards are the property of the player as of the moment they say ""I'm dropping"".

This is not new information. This is not a recent policy change. It's been like this for a good long while. But still, the myth persists that this is somehow a huge horrendous evil DQ-and-police-and-DCI-ban offense. It is not.

Please, for the sanity of people who have to answer rules/policy questions in forums like this one, spread this information far and wide.",,False,,t5_2qn5f,1371993576.0,,text,True,t3_1gwnrm,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1gwnrm/psa_dropping_from_a_tournament_before_sealedpool/,

1365187422.0,443,self.magicTCG,1br08y,[DGM] What we can tell Dragon's Maze just from Render Silent.,bokchoykn,524,81,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1br08y/dgm_what_we_can_tell_dragons_maze_just_from/,"This is going to be very detailed and a bit long winded but here goes...

* Dragon's Maze has 156 cards, plus the ten Shocklands. Each Shockland will still belong to its respective set (Return to Ravnica or Gatecrash) and still have that set's expansion symbol. They are not part of the Dragon's Maze set. 

* The ten Guildgates, however, are considered part of the set's 156 cards since they will be receiving new art.

* Each card in a set is assigned a ""Collector's Number"", displayed at the very bottom of the card. Collector's Numbers are assigned in **order of color**. For example, in Gatecrash: #1-28 = White; #29-56 = Blue; 57-84 = Black; #85-112 = Red; #113-140 = Green, #141-210 = Multicolor, #211-225 = Hybrid; #226-238 = Artifact; #239-249 = Land. [See here.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?sort=cn+&amp;output=checklist&amp;action=advanced&amp;set=[""Gatecrash""])

* Cards within the same ""color"" are then subsequently given Collector's Numbers in **alphabetical order**. 

* All multicolor and hybrid cards are considered as the same ""color"" for the purpose of assigning Collector's Numbers. Only the fact that they are *multicolor* or *hybrid* is observed, and the actual colors in the card are ignored. For example, Alms Beast (a White/Black card) is #141 and Assemble the Legion (a White/Red card) is #142.

* Maze's End's Collector Number is 152/156. There are four lands that succeed Maze's End alphabetically. We already know that they are: Orzhov Guildgate, Rakdos Guildgate, Selesnya Guildgate, and Simic Guildgate. Not a lot of information here.

Here's the biggie...

**[Render Silent](http://imgur.com/hJQBQBa)'s Collector's Number is 96/156.** 

* 60 cards succeed Render's Silent in Collector's Number. At least 11 of them are Non-Basic Lands. The rest of them are Multicolored (alphabetically after *Render Silent*), Hybrid, Artifact, or Non-Basic Lands (alphabetically before *Maze's End*)

* At #96/156, Render Silent is about 61.5% down the list. A Multicolored card starting with the letter R falling this early is extremely unusual, even for a heavily Multicolor set. In Gatecrash, Render Silent would have been 76.4% down the list. This implies that there are a ton of Multicolor, Hybrid, Artifact, or Non-Basic Lands, and a relatively small number of monocolored spells.

From this we can reasonably conclude that *(unless Dragon's Maze has a ton of artifacts)*...

**Dragon's Maze is at least very heavily multicolored ~~and is very possibly entirely Multicolored.~~**

**IMPORTANT EDIT:**

I crunched the numbers again, and **it's not going to be entirely multicolored but still very heavily Multicolored**.

Alphabetically, card names starting in *Re-* are usually about 2/3 down the list. 

If there were 70 Multicolored cards in the set and Render Silent was the 46th of them, there would be about 50 mono-colored spells. This leaves room for about 25 Hybrid, Artifact, or Land cards that we don't already know about.

**My final prediction:**

&gt; **~ 50 Mono-colored**

&gt; **~ 70 Multi-colored**

&gt; **~ 25 Hybrid/Artifact** (Maybe a 20/5 split)

&gt; **~ 11 Non-Basic Land**

(Compare to Gatecrash)

&gt; 140 Mono-colored

&gt; 70 Multi-colored

&gt; 15 Hybrid

&gt; 13 Artifact

&gt; 11 Land

Pulled my second on turn ten

Mana, mullin' down to one

If I'm not back again this time next Friday

Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Life points dropping all the time

Goodbye, shot at top 8 - I've got to go

Unfortunately, jestergoblin still seems to be under the weather, so I'm picking this up at least for tonight again. As I mentioned previously, I'm very open to comments or criticisms, so if there's anything you'd like to see differently, please don't hesitate to let me know. I have enjoyed lurking on this subreddit for quite some time now, and I'm happy to give back however I can. I'll be temporarily unemployed over the next two weeks, so honestly doing this will be welcomed as something for me to do to kill time. As long as you'll have me, I certainly don't mind filling in whenever necessary.  

**Edit:** Sorry I missed a couple. A man's gotta get some sleep :)

Most of you know the drill, but here it is anyway. For the next few weeks, I will sacrifice what is known as ""sleep"" to consolidate all of the spoilers into a single thread that allows for discussion to occur in one place.

So instead of spamming the crap out of this subreddit in regards to everyone trying to claim ""FIRST!!1!"" with the spoilers, we're trying to keep them all together in a single post.

For people who prefer pictures, check out all of today's spoilers [over here](http://castlesandcooks.com/2012/09/13/i-got-a-fever-and-the-only-prescription-is-more-return-to-ravnica-spoilers/). 

For a [full text-spoiler of Return to Ravnica](http://mtgsalvation.com/return-to-ravnica-spoiler.html) so far and here is a [visual spoiler](http://castlesandcooks.com/magic-the-gathering-spoilers/return-to-ravnica-visual-spoiler/) of the ones so far.

All of yesterday's reveals [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/zqzsb/rtr_all_return_to_ravnica_spoilers_for_912/).

**Why I do this:** I've been active in this subreddit for a while (and active on Magic forums even longer), and I wanted to give back to the community. While sites like MTGSalvation and GatheringMagic also have spoilers, I manually compile the text spoilers here on Reddit for one main reason: to help people who are stuck behind firewalls and stupid corporate systems that block various websites.

forest = draw a card

plains = get a card from grave yard to hand

mountain = stone rain

swamp = opponent discards a card

island = no etb effect but can be pitched along with another land to act as a force of will to counter their play.

the idea of the game is to get to 1 of each color basic land, or to get 5 of one color basic land. 

I wanted to know if anyone else has played this version or if there are other versions out there.

1374658051.0,403,self.magicTCG,1iy37g,A Small PSA: Just because Sun Titan is in the new Duel Decks does NOT mean the Titans are coming back,Sephiroth912,523,120,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1iy37g/a_small_psa_just_because_sun_titan_is_in_the_new/,"This has really been bugging me the fact that people are constantly insisting the titans are coming back in Theros and having to repeat myself, so I thought I might try to clear the air of this in general and offer an explanation of why they won't be returning. For the unaware, [Sun Titan is being reprinted in the new Duel Decks: Heroes vs. Monsters set with new art as one of the two flagship mythics](http://i.imgur.com/WAbAuDB.jpg). A quick trip to different pages, be they local stores to the official MtG Facebook page, shows a LOT of people suddenly showing their excitement that the titans are coming back. For better or worse, this is most likely to not be the case.

At first glance it seems like they would be. They're titans, giant dudes that would be far from out of place on a Greeco-Roman plane, especially how popular they were in Standard and other formats. But they were just as unpopular as they were popular, with Wizards stating they were even hesitant to reprint them in M12 because of the divisiveness they created among players, but wanted to give people who bought into them another go with them. This is one reason, but hardly compelling enough.

The big giveaway though lies not with a product from this year, but rather one from last year. Duel Decks: Izzet vs. Golgari, to be specific. This set's two flagship mythics were the brand new [Jarad, Golgari Lich Lord](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=292771) and...a reprint of [Niv-Mizzet, the Firemind](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=292738). This got the Magic community abuzz for a little while. We all knew that Niv-Mizzet was coming back in RTR since he was practically the face of the set alongside Jace and so many people started wondering if we were getting a new Niv-Mizzet or a reprint of the old one. [We wound up with the former.](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=253626) Why is this so important? It shows the start of a trend in these Duel Deck products: reprinting one classic card as a mythic and one new mythic. Given that they've shown us the two mythics in the set already (or at least the names and arts of them), it's clear to say that [Sun Titan](http://i.imgur.com/WAbAuDB.jpg) is the classic reprint (and while the titans are rather new, they will likely be classic cards regardless in their own right and are very on-flavor with Theros as mentioned before) and [Polukranos, World Eater](http://i.imgur.com/v1wMbhy.jpg) is the new mythic.

My third and final piece of reasoning for this is a really simple one: Putting the full cycle of titans in Theros heavily constricts design space. A typical large set has approximately 15 mythics in it, though as was proven with Innistrad, Dark Ascension, and Dragon's Maze due to the use of different sheets for the transform cards and the gates/shocks/Maze's End, but so far this set doesn't have some odd gimmick that would allow that. The Gods use a different frame, sure, but so did Miracles and they weren't printed on a different sheet. What that means is that were they to print the titans once again, they would be using 5 of 15 mythic slots on reprints, which is a highly unreasonable expectation of them for a non-core or non-reprint set. In fact, the one and only mythic we've seen reprinted in a block set was [Mindslaver](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=209044) back in Scars of Mirrodin. Though we did see many similar almost-reprints in that block, Mindslaver was the only direct reprint. What this means is that putting 5 titans into a set like this means 5 less mythic slots for brand new cards which are meant to sell the set. This does not mean that they can't create new titans and maybe reprint one of them, but Wizards has stated that the titans simply on their own hurt design space because their existence influenced the cards they were able to print.

So to conclude, I'm not saying they aren't for sure, absolutely not coming back. Wizards has neither confirmed nor denied this fact. However, I implore you to not get your hopes up, as given a couple of telling signs, they will most likely *not* be coming back with this year's fall expansion and back into standard.",,False,,t5_2qn5f,False,,selesnya,True,t3_1iy37g,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1iy37g/a_small_psa_just_because_sun_titan_is_in_the_new/,

1350538934.0,398,self.magicTCG,11od4v,"Dear Wizards, Standard is far too expensive right now. Here's why, in my humble opinion.",interesting_username,641,243,563,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/11od4v/dear_wizards_standard_is_far_too_expensive_right/,"Okay, before a barrage of downvotes comes, please just hear me out for a moment or two.

I've played since last May when NPH released right at the height of JtMS and Caw Blade so I'm no stranger to blisteringly expensive decks, but since Scars block rotated out, what was a mildly pricey hobby has become a burden to even think about. Standard is the entry point for those looking to get into competitive constructed play. If the financial barrier is set too high, fewer and fewer players are going to want to play Type 2. Now, you may be thinking, ***""Hey jackass, WotC has no control over secondary market prices""*** Well, I'm here to tell you, **that's just not true.** 

Here's what I perceive to be the biggest barriers to getting into Standard right now and here's what WotC can do about it.

**1. The Shocklands** - The re-print of the shocklands was supposed to herald a new age of modern wherein players could build the mana base for a competitive deck without having to drop large sums of money. Instead what has happened is the demand for shocks has been so high and the amount of them readily available on the market has kept the prices in the $14-$18 range. This means that for a player who wants to run a 2-color deck, (which RTR encourages with the guild system!) they're looking at an investment of at least $60. That doesn't even include the extra $20-$50 or so for M10 or Innistrad duals or the cost of any utility lands they might need from the Innistrad block. The amount of money needed just to build the manabase for a deck is a significant portion of the deck and if the cost is too high, players won't even bother trying to build the deck.

**2. Mythic Endgame Cards** - In the past couple of blocks we've had a number of choices for cards used as endgame finishers or capstones to a deck. More often than not, they're Mythic Rares that swing the game in your favor. Last block, one of the major weapons of choice was the Titans. The titans had been printed in M11 and M12 and there were plenty of them floating around. On top of that, 5 out the 6 Titans (yes, we're counting Wurmcoil Engine) were printed as promos. This means that two printings worth of Titans were available to players. Wizards' rationale for reprinting the Titans was that players wanted to feel like their big huge Mythic cards were worth something for a longer period of time. Prices remained high, usually in the $10-20 range for a Titan, but they never spiraled out of control like Bonfire,  Jace, Architect of Thought, or Geist of St. Traft (really, $30 for a *sideboard* card!) have. Buying a playset of Titans was a big investment in a deck, but it wasn't ever a $200 investment. Now, if I want to get the preferred capstone for my WU control deck, I'm looking at roughly $120. That is if I can get together the $200 I'll need for a playset of JAoT and the $80 I'll need just for a set of Hallowed Fountains. That's $300 for just 12 cards.

**Okay, then what can WotC do about it?!** - Two things. **One, they can start including better cards more often in their event decks.** When Inkmoth started getting absurdly priced in the secondary market, WotC quelled that by including it in an Event Deck. The inclusion sold more Event Decks for Wizards and drove the price down for everyone else. Throwing a couple of shocklands in each Event Deck would tremendously help players trying to get into the format. **And Two, they can (re)start giving away *good* Mythic Rares as promos.** I know it sounds like it would hurt sales, but when you're introduced to a new set and someone hands you a Grave Titan or a Wurmcoil engine for free, you're overwhelmed by the sheer awesomeness of the card and you immediately start trying to build around it. Maybe you go out and buy 3 more Grave Titans or 3 more Wurmcoils, but without that first one to ignite your spark, so to speak, it's not going to happen.
 
As a final note, I'd like to say that yes, I know Wizards is in the business of selling packs and they want people to buy packs in the hopes of pulling valuable rares and mythic rares. I know that the core group of players will go out and will buy those packs, but if the secondary market value of each of those cards is so high that its stunts the growth of the community, sales of packs will also be stunted along with sales of sleeves, playmats, deckboxes and all the other stuff WotC licenses. It's not worth killing the community's wallets just to keep peoples perception of pack value high. **In summary, pricier cards won't lead to more sales, a larger and more financially accessible community will.**

I'd also like to remind everyone that while there is a serious wave of disappointment surrounding Emmara Tandris, keep in mind WOTC isn't in the business of pissing people off. There's a reason why she ended up the way she did which was responded to on Maro's tumblr, so while I did some light poking at how Emmara ended up, please remember that R&amp;D knows that many of you are displeased. I'm sure in the future they will take the necessary steps to avoid this problem again.

With Avacyn Restored fully spoiled, we've got a bit of a lull before everyone starts talking about how they did at the prerelease, so we've got a bit of time to have a discussion about subreddit policy:

As of *right now*, we don't have an official policy against memes. This probably comes as no shock to most of you, since I've seen a fair bit of griping about the meme posts, and I know I've personally gotten sick of seeing the ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" dog on the front page at almost all times.

When the subreddit was much smaller, the moderation was very hands-off: we only deleted posts that were blatant spam or insanely offensive. As the subreddit has grown, we've had to be a bit more active with regards to spammers and trolls.

Should we extend that to doing something about memes in an effort to improve the quality of the front page? The way I see it, we have a couple of options:

* Leave meme posts alone and allow them to be upvoted to the top of the subreddit.

* Delete the advice animal/quickmeme posts.

* Delete any posts that are only Magic-related by means of the title the user gave the post.

Please discuss the pros and cons of the various options intelligently, and please feel free to propose other alternatives. The moderators will not take action arbitrarily in this regard, and it's unlikely that we would adopt any of the policies this week.

**To be clear, this discussion is *only* about top-level posts and not for comments within threads. Even if we ban all meme-type content at the top level, users will still be allowed to use memes in comments.**",,False,,t5_2qn5f,True,,boros,True,t3_spc2e,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/spc2e/hey_rmagictcg_lets_talk_about_memes/,moderator

I am posting an update on the post I made a couple of weeks ago about my son's Magic cards having been stolen from his locker at school. He was very bummed, his GF was very bummed, and I was both sad and pissed. I couldn't walk out of here and either throttle the thief, nor could I ever hope to replace the cars, so I was at a loss. 

I posted here, more out of frustration and desire to get an alert out to the community. I know MTG cards have certain cash value and can be sold (to a store or to individuals) so i needed to say something. 

And OMG, this group here simply stepped right up and handled the matter. Offers flew in from folks wanting to send my son some of their own cards, offers to get him back into playing condition, and there were even offers to send cards to my son's GF, who also plays, and has played at some of the in-store events where my son has served as her ASL interpreter. 

Anyway, I'm gushing a bit, as today my son received the second package of cards sent to him. I absolutely must thank JubilationLee, and one other person, though I have to go back through my notes and find that person's Reddit name. I received a box a few days back from that person, too, but haven't been able to thank him because I don't have anything but his real-life name. 

Anyway, just wanted to get in here and post. My connection has been really bad for about 8 or 9 days while they did something to the wireless gizmo. I hope it has been fixed, but I never know. I have a couple of pictures, but I have to download and edit them, then I'll post the picture of my kid and the wonderful items you folks sent. I'll also get the correct name of the other sender and post back here.

Two years ago in early Spring, a friend of a friend realized his lifelong dream, and opened his own Comic/Gaming/Hobby shop, called Icons.  There were naysayers and those who disagreed with his business model, and his location, but for 2 and a half magnificent years, he succeeded.  The store was small, but clean and organized.  The players area was always open, and took more than half of the store all to itself.  The selection was not vast, but prize support was consistent, supplies constant, and environment friendly and receptive to all players, new or old.

I had been out of magic for some time, and saw that they were doing a sealed event for New Phyrexia, and decided to give it a whirl.  That was the push that helped me to return after my hiatus, and engage the community once again.  

If anything, it reminded me of how much Magic is a SOCIAL experience, because it is meant to be played with people...friends, strangers, enemies, people-who-will-become-your-friends....it's not just 2 sweaty dudes in a basement.  It's the mother of two who gets out once a week to do FNM.  It's the college kid who is wheeling his best-he-can-afford deck.  It's the netdeck specialist.  It's the crazy-combo-kid who wins once in a while, in spectacular fashion.  It's the people that make us play, and give us the stage for the huge plays we make.  I remember my best plays, much like everybody else does, but I remember WHO I was playing, when it happened, what was the scenario, what was the mood....etc, etc...people make Magic so much of what makes it awesome.  

Sitting in the backroom there, I played countless Sealed, Standard, Draft and EDH games.  Two-Headed Giant had recently become a rotating favorite, with a 2HG Sealed being the last variation of it we tried.  We even did Legacy and Modern to less frequent nights, and Pauper once or twice.  We did an 8-week league.  We did a 4-of-a-kind-nothing-banned tourney (minus Unglued/Unhinged) that was off the hook.

But there, I got to make new friends.  Not that I needed them...I had a huge social circle...but it enriched my life.  I met a guy who introduced me to EDH, who introduced me to his bud, and then his wife.  I re-met a friend I had lost touch with for 10 years plus, and his new fiancee, and ended up being in his wedding party.  I met a guy who lived across the street from me, who was related to one of my best friends, that I NEVER met in 8 years of being on the same street.  Just random chance.  And those are just the ones off the top of my head.

I spent oodles at the store.  Sure, the singles selection got mauled over routinely and they didn't have what you wanted all the time, but he constantly restocked in anyway he could.  Orders took time, but he would always order for you, and never charge shipping.  He did 3 packs for 10 on Fridays.....and everyday for his routine customers.  He also gave 30% off singles everyday for his routine customers.  His Black Friday sales last year were 50% off all singles, and this year, 60% off all singles.  We gorged.

On Monday afternoon I got the news that the store was going to close for good on Wednesday.  Realistically, it closed Tuesday evening, with a lot of packing and a few EDH diehards in the backroom at the last table, playing their last hands before heading home.  Today will be all packing, with heavy hearts.  Monday felt a lot like a funeral, as everyone gathered to play in one last RTR Draft.  Everyone played, and whether rivals or not, all shook hands, and wished each other well.  The store owner fought back tears the whole night, because this, his dream, was dying.

When asked about the store, he never spoke of profits, he never spoke of making money or breaking even, or anything of the sort.  He said that he wanted a place for kids to be able to come after school, and hangout for free, and play games, and socialize.  He had family board games night, where he would rip open a new board game and let the kids all play with it.  He had free Pokemon tourneys.  He would provide pizza and sodas for tourneys far too small to support them, ALONG with prize support.  He would speak of upcoming events, and exciting new things he wanted everyone to try.

But never once about financial hardship, or turning a profit.  For him, it was about US.  It was about the customer (whom he considered his friends), and making an experience, for US.

So today, on the day that my LGS closes, I ask you, please be kind to your owners.  Thank them for all the struggling and hardship that they've had to endure, and for providing a clean, stable environment for you, and do whatever you can to help them.  You get out of these places what you put into them.  I just wish there was more we could have done to save this one.

Most of you know the drill, but here it is anyway.

I want to assuage some of these fears with some of the following clarifications.

You cannot get a game loss or match loss at an FNM. This goes for drafts, standard events, or whatever. If the head judge has not come out and said that the event is to be run at Competitive REL(FNM's are at Regular REL).

There are only two options whenever a judge is called upon at the Regular REL and something has gone wrong.

1. Fix it. Fix it now.

2. Disqualify someone.

99% of the time, they will do the first. #2 is only done if the judge suspects that someone is purposefully trying to gain an unfair advantage by cheating, or if they are being disruptive, threatening, or hurtful.

FNMs, and everything else at the Regular REL is supposed to be fun times for all. Penalties are just not given out. You don't even get warning penalties. There's really nothing to be afraid of, as long as you and your opponent are both making honest mistakes. Magic is hard, and FNM is definitely the place to make such errors.

I mean, just look at the following comparisons of how different the rulings are:

Drawing an extra card
Competitive: Game Loss.
Regular: Put the card back on top. If you aren't sure which card, take a card at random.

Looking at extra cards of own deck
Competitive: Warning. Randomize the cards that are unknown in the deck.
Regular: Randomize the cards that are unknown in the deck.

Illegal card in deck
Competitive: Game loss. Replace card with basic land of player's choice.
Regular: Replace card with card of player's choice.

We're really just around to fix problems and make sure people have a fun time. I judge and play in my local FNM, I try to go out of my way to make sure people feel comfortable calling judges and that they know we exist solely for their benefit.",,False,,t5_2qn5f,False,,text,True,t3_s16yz,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/s16yz/misconceptions_fnms_not_actually_serious_business/,

* can we get more Uncharted Realms? ""Trying to expand the feature"" but writing fiction is very hard, but they're watching the stats and readership
* will we get 4-color legends? Can't say yet, never say never, ""when not if""
* foreign cards - can we get more Duel Decks in more foreign languages? Not always under R&amp;D control, needs fluctuate
* if you could pick a card or concept or mechanic to put into Alpha block (go back in time to inspire Magic) - member of R&amp;D says he would have wanted actual gold (multicolor) cards which would have given them more time to evolve it; another says ""add legends""; another ""change nothing""
* modern masters - availability concerns, especially for Draft? ""It is going to be a small run, knife-edge balance, available but not for terribly long, should be enough for people to play in stores but also for events"" ""asking for your trust"" ""let your store know you want to draft it""
* modern seems like a seasonal format, can this be changed? Are you happy with the format as it is now? ""It's been a little volatile"", legacy is more stable, ""feel like we are almost there"", FNM legality now possible, talk to your stores
* Commander - haven't heard anything about this years product - what's up? Planned for the end of this year. 
* Dimir underpowered in Standard? R&amp;D erred on cautious side with cipher. DGM should be a bit better; thinks well see more black cards as the format evolves
* how would you like to see magic change/improve? Platform expansion (playing magic whenever you are, single-player experience), broader awareness of something like D&amp;D, accessibility issues; ubiquity and ease of trial 
* designing legends for EDH? Lots of allies of commander at wotc, want to make at least some legendary creatures for EDH, but some have roles elsewhere and we do consider all legends potential commanders now
* my question: why is pyroclasm not in standard? Deliberate choice, wanted less-oppressive environment for multicolored small creatures 
* legacy development? Occasional focus
* more and more hexproof cards - any shroud cards? Hexproof is now the primary, hexproof and shroud unlikely to be in the same set, going back to shroud depends on other factors, we find players enjoy hexproof and we want to allow that as long as hexproof isn't too efficient, we are backing off from that
* **what is next for Fblthp?** flavor says they can't have the spark :( one-off flavor text :(
* unsets? (Applause from crowd) ""we love them too"", ""never is a long time"", but no specific plans
* MTGO redemption - will we see more things like the Avacyn's Pilgrim promo? Hard to play both online and paper Magic? -- huge goal to improve MTGO and make it an easier way to play; know its a burden to have two collections, but encouraging more interrelations between the two
* Wolfir, Revenants, Gryffs, Merfolk - where are they? Where are the Gateless? -- create a lot of world detail without being able to guarantee it will be used; recently started publishing them; sometimes these things don't find a home on cards but we hope it's cool enough on its own; wre mindful that people now expect things from the planeswalkers guides to show up on cards
* where did the phyrexian language go? -- it doesn't have it's own vocabulary (it has its own syntax and grammar); was created for etchings; super-niche, but the documents exist, we could see it ""if and when"" the phyrexians return
* big gruul cards but not enough good ramp -- any in DGM? Can't reveal what's in DGM, but the philosophy of ramping is we don't want to over-saturate it in Standard; red is strong in standard now; ramp is not the best it's ever been in standard, true, but it's pretty good
* bonus question from awesome Stoneforge mystic cosplay -- mismatched cycles from RTR and DGM, we can't always complete cycles because its hard to fit; we know magic players are pattern-finders and we are too internally

Level 3 Magic Judges are not just expert judges, with superior rules and policy knowledge, but also community leaders, helping their regional Magic communities grow and prosper.  James completely destroyed the incredibly difficult Level 3 Rules Exam, which should come as no surprise to his fellow redditors, as he's been answering the hardest rules questions you guys and gals have been able to throw at him in this subreddit for ages.  
He then proceeded to successfully pass a 2+ hour interview in front of a panel of some of the most experienced judges in the program, doing everything they could to trip him up.

But James' was able to emerge (relatively) unscathed, and I'm sure he'll do the title of Level 3 Judge great justice.

Added Bonus:

Due to James' incredible track record in this subreddit, providing in-depth explanations of rule and policy changes just about as soon as they're announced, answering the hardest of rules and policy questions, and constantly representing both the game and the Judge Program with tact, we're making James Bennett the official NetRep (representative) of the Judge Program to /r/magictcg!",,False,,t5_2qn5f,False,,text,True,t3_13j01g,http://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/13j01g/our_newest_level_3_magic_judge_is_redditor/,

Next to that, I have been producing both a German as well as an English-language draft video series.
Two years ago, there were a lot of pro players recording draft videos. It was easy to watch good players play limited Magic, but it wasn't as easy to figure out why they were good or consistently winning. I decided that I wanted to try to create a truly educational video series focused on drafting -- highlighting both high-level strategy and low-level decision-making. This series is [Simon Says](https://www.mtgoacademy.com/author/simon-goertzen/).
Lately, there has been quite a lot of interest in Limited (particularly Gatecrash Limited) on twitter and this subreddit. At the same time, I have found a way to draft Gatecrash which has been incredible for me on Magic Online. My latest episode went up at [MTGOAcademy](http://www.mtgoacademy.com) today:

[Simon Says #41: Madness? This is Gatecrash! (GTC 8-4)](https://www.mtgoacademy.com/simon-says-41-madness-this-is-gatecrash-gtc-8-4/)

I am posting this for two reasons. The first is certainly (shameless?) self-promotion, as I invest a lot of time into this series and would love to see it reach an even wider audience. The second is that I believe that I have at least partially succeeded in creating something which players of all calibers can profit from.

Feel free to comment on the Jace Test, on the state of ""creatures matter"" Magic, or any of the other ideas presented below. Kudos to /u/andrewula for sparking this idea in my head, and I hope he's still browsing /r/MagicTCG to add his opinions.

For the last two years of Standard, we as a Magic community have shifted our definitions of ""good"" creatures. Certain factors have made some classes of creatures unplayable. Are we now spoiled on ""good"" creatures? Specifically, I'm talking about ""the Jace test"" and how it has changed our definitions of and our reliance on ""good"" creatures.

For background, Jace the Mind Sculptor has the -1 ability to Unsummon a creature. Jace's prevalence in ANY blue deck led to the necessity of a higher class of creatures in Standard: those who affected the game before they could be bounced. 

Early cards that passed the Jace Test were Avenger of Zendikar, which would leave behind an army of token creatures with hopefully 1 or more power by the time he was bounced, or Bloodbraid Elf, whose haste could combat Jace and whose cascade would further your board position. Classic cards that couldn't pass the Jace test were Phyrexian Obliterator or Baneslayer Angel, cards that cost you all that land and time, only to be found in your hand before they could ever tap sideways.

Jace's presence helped define the Titan cycle as the highest echelon of creatures in recent history: they were creatures that did something as soon as they resolved, and even if they were bounced, their effect on the battlefield had already been felt, and in fact, bouncing them only fogged 6 damage the next turn, as recasting them provided the same benefits that attacking with them would have.

After Jace and Stoneforge received the ban-hammers, a lot of previously-squelched control decks rose to the tops, UW and UB dominating for the week after ban. Each of these decks typically ran Into the Roil as a way to interact with planeswalkers like Gideon Jura, but the Jace Test demanded respect, and people were still conscious of it. 

Let's fast forward now to our current environment, where people know that any creature they cast has the chance of costing them a turn and a life when the Delver deck casts Vapor Snag and swings in for 6 damage. Huntmaster of the Fells provides a token and 2 life, titans are still viable end-game creatures, and bouncing Elesh Norn is probably worse EV than scooping up your Delver deck and going to game 2.

As a compliment to the Jace Test, we all expect more resilience in our creatures, and thanks to Undying, we've enjoyed just that. Slagstorms and Whipflares help control a R/G or R/B aggro deck but Strangleroot Geists, Gravediggers, and Geralf's Messengers just shrug it off like a pesky mosquito. Even Gloom Surgeon has seen some play as annoying chump blocker of the hour in the Blood Artist decksat GP Minneapolis for his ability to hold off both of the swings from a Strangleroot Geist. Pod decks have all manner of Enter the Battlefield effects on their creatures, and often time the mere effect is worth the Pod activation.

Now let's turn our scopes forward a year. We've lost Vapor Snag and I don't know if Delver will remain the same deck that it is now (Unsummon ~~costing an extra mana~~ (sorry for the misinformation, I was thinking Boomerang) and not pinging them a life is a huge difference to the deck, imo). We'll have (hopefully) lost the Titans, and we'll still have Undying creatures. Is our metric for gauging ""good"" creatures going to ever change? Will we ever be satisfied again with a Baneslayer Angel reprint?

People are already looking forward to Titan-less Standard, but the options are found lacking. Griselbrand nets you a gripful of cards but is very difficult to get into play. Gisela swings for half your opponent's starting life, but is as vulnerable to the Jace Test as ever a creature was. Drogskol Reaver suffers as well, and we lose our titans and titan-lites such as Elesh Norn and Consecrated Sphynx. Presumably we'll still have people trying Snapcaster tempo decks, especially if a functional one-mana bounce spell sees print in M13 or Return to Ravnica. We'll still have Victim of Night, Doom Blade, and other spot removal spells from Black.

Many people like to regurgitate the mantra ""Saying 'It dies to Doom Blade' isn't a good analyses of the card."" when analyzing creatures. I posit that it has been a very relevant criteria for our creatures for the past two years, only it was more commonly acknowledged as “It loses the Jace Test.” Gone are the days where we can run Leatherback Baloth, that huge, cheap monster well above the power curve, because it’s a time walk to get it bounced or destroyed.  Now the only reason we might run Phyrexian Obliterator is when we can Pod into it without losing our 3 drop in the process, and only one deck archetype can profitably deal with him. In fact, no deck will probably ever run Hypnotic Specter or Serra Angel again, even though those were once the pinnacle of Magic's creatures.

We have been trained to respect the Jace Test, even when our Standard environment now doesn’t have every single blue deck running Vapor Snags, unlike every blue deck that ran Jace himself. We have a new blue Planeswalker that does a fine-enough Mind Sculpting impression: Tamiyo, who can keep a creature tapped down indefinitely, ensuring that if you received no benefit from it yet, you never will.  We expect our creatures to do something for us the moment they hit play, whether it be an Enter the Battlefield effect or to represent resilience to sweepers/removal.  We expect our 1-drop to swing for 3 next turn, be it a Delver or Champion of the Parish. We expect our generic giant beaters of yesterday to not be so generic today; Dungrove Elder wouldn’t see play if it didn’t have Hexproof. It's a passing of age for the Magic community, and is reflected in deckbuilding choices by the players, and design choices by R&amp;D.

When you are building your decks, you must respect the Jace Test and the lessons we’ve learned as a Magic community from the best planeswalker ever printed. If your creature does nothing but waste your turn and your mana, then it is a prime candidate for being cut from the 75. We can’t and don’t just settle for any creature nowadays and until Wizards strays from this creatures-matter philosophy they’ve had for years, the shadow of the Jace Test will continue to fall upon us.

About the author: I first started playing MtG Christmas of 94, and have played for more years than not since then. My highest achievements so far have been two PTQ top 8s (the 2nd was a crushing loss in the finals to a top deck). I'm lvl 37 or 38 on planeswalker points, so I don't pretend to be good or the best, but I wanted to at least share my ideas and maybe even get some feedback on my writing. Hopefully more discussion from better players will continue below, so that even I may learn something from this!
