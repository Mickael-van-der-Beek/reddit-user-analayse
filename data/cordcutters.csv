I am writing to let you know that I am canceling my DirecTV service. We first signed up for DirecTV when we lived in(omitted from Reddit post) . We were looking to save money on our cable TV package. It worked out wonderfully for us and we loved the service. 

We actually put our account on hold when we moved from (omitted from Reddit post) as we loved the service and wanted to continue with what we thought was excellent service for a good monthly fee. 

When we moved back to Austin and bought our house we quickly called DirecTV to resume our service in April of 2012 at (omitted from Reddit post). When we spoke with the representative they informed us that for the price point that we wanted to pay the best package for us was the ChoiceExtra package. At the time the cost was going to be around $55 a month with a HD DVR box and HD receiver with whole home viewing. After taxes our monthly total was to be $77.89 a month. We were getting this price by signing a 2 year agreement and having the auto-bill pay service feature enabled as well.

Alas our time with DirecTV this go around was a nightmare. The service was installed on time, our promised rebates we were guaranteed for being returning customers were submitted on time, and the service was wonderful for the first 3 months. Our bill was what it was supposed to be. 

Month 4 started. When month 4 started our bill quickly skyrocketed to over $100 a month. When I called DirecTV to inquire about this, I was quickly informed that our “3 month promotion” was over and this was to be our regular rate. After numerous escalations during the course of this call, I was informed that our rebates were never properly processed in time so we would not be getting them. I pulled up my email account and was able to verify the date that they were sent in and the representative that I spoke with stated that yes they were finally able to find my rebates and would make sure that they were submitted and proceeded to credit our account for the overage to get our bill back down to $77.89 a month. We were apologized to for the oversight and informed that this issue was now resolved and that we should be receiving our rebates shortly. I spent 2 hours on the phone trying to get this issue resolved so I was happy...or so I thought.

Three days after this, I received an automated call from the DirecTV accounts escalation department stating that our rebates were not processed on time and we would not be receiving them. This is after I had verbal confirmation from a DirecTV supervisor that they saw that the rebates were submitted on time and that they would be contacting the rebate department to ensure we would be receiving them. 

At this point I really did not care about the rebates as I really only wanted our monthly rate that we signed up for.

Month 5 we were charged our correct amount.

Month 6, our bill once again skyrocketed. Our charges were well over $100 again!!! I called DirecTV once again to inquire about the charges. I was again informed that our 3 month promotion was over and that this was to be our regular rate. Once again I escalated the call. Once speaking with a supervisor, they were able to see the previous calls and previous credits. They were not sure why they were not being applied and stated that they would correct the situation immediately and get our bill adjusted back to our normal monthly rate and as a side note, this representative informed me that they saw we had some rebates on our account that were never applied. They stated that they would address this issue for us and that we should be receiving them shortly. The total length of this call was 1.5 hours.

This time DirecTV waited about 4 days before using the automated system to contact me and state that my rebates were not processed on time and we would not be receiving them. Once again this is after 2 DirecTV supervisors stated to me that they saw the rebates on my account, saw that they were entered on time, and that I had not received them. I still did not really care about the rebates but if I get them, hooray for me. I just want my monthly rate of $77.89.

Month 7 - November, our bill was incorrect. Our issue was not resolved. Our charges were over $100 again. I am starting to see a trend here.....I contact DirectTV again and went through all escalations and once again I was promised that this issue was to be resolved. I was also informed in the course of this call that this was the last time DirectTV could issue any credits to the account as this would be the 3rd time they have done so. I informed the representative that this was ok, AS LONG AS MY MONTHLY BILL WAS TO BE $77.89 GOING FORWARD. I was once again promised that this issue would be fixed.

Month 8, December. Our bill was incorrect. Due to a death in the family I did not feel up to battling DirecTV but I knew if I did not call we would be stuck with high monthly bills for ever for a service at this point that we do not even really want any longer as it has never saved us the money we were promised.

I was informed by the representative this time that I had charges for adult movies on the account. I don’t rent pay per view, and I certainly do not pay for adult movies when the content is available online for free. I inquired as to when these charges took place, the charges were made to my account when no one was in the house. We were out of town for the aforementioned funeral and there was no way they could have been charged to the account as no one was in the house to charge them. The DirecTV representative stated that they could remove these charges as a one time courtesy for me and that this was the last time that my account would be credited. We should not have these charges any longer, our monthly bill should return to normal.

January 2013, our monthly bill this month is only $90, so it is slightly lower but still not what we were originally promised. So I called to cancel my account. I am done DirecTV, you win, you have worn me down to past the point of caring. I will no longer be using your service. I was informed that there was a cancelation fee of $280 on the account since I was terminating my service early. 

This is an unjust fee. I do not feel that I should have to pay for this cancelation fee. The retention “specialist” that I spoke with stated that yes she can see all the issues that I have had with my account but that there is nothing she can do to waive the fee. I do not think that it is right for DirecTV to not honor their contracts that customers agreed to. It appears to me that DirecTV reserves the right to change the monthly fees at their whim and when customers call to address these issues, their representatives are trained to say or do whatever they can to keep the customer. All they care about is my money and how to take more of it. It does not matter to DirecTV that they have a once happy customer that returned to them for service when there are many alternatives available. 

As a result of your horrible customer service throughout this whole ordeal, I am canceling my service. I am becoming a member of the vast cordcutting armada. I am standing up and saying no to service providers not giving a care in the world to their subscribers. 

I might have to pay your unjust cancelation fee but I am also sending this email to consumerist.com and posting it to reddit.com. If you have not heard of either of those sites I suggest looking them up. They are quite large and MANY MANY people visit them on a daily basis. If by sharing my story with the public I can convince just 10 people to not sign up for your service, then the cancelation fee will have been well worth it. 

Sincerely,

A very disgusted formerly happy DirecTV subscriber

EDIT: sunday 6:04PMCST - I just received a phone call from DirecTV Executive Customer relations. I am at work right now but I will be calling the lady back tomorrow and I will post the conversation here as well.

EDIT: Monday 8:15ACST - spoke with DirecTV Executive Customer relations. The rep that I spoke with was able to see everything on my account that I was speaking about. She did state that I was being charged the incorrect amount. She has given me 12 months of partial credit to offset the reminder of our time with DirecTV and to make our bill what it should be. She did say that she was not able to waive the ETF at all and this is what she is authorized to do. While not entirely happy because I was looking forward to finally cutting the cord, I at least got DirecTV to honor their original contract with me....in writing :) I had her email her terms to me before I would agree to anything. I really wanted to say screw you but the ETF is $480 and not sure that they won't just draft it straight from the bank anyways. I am still calling the bank later today to see what I can do about that because I would really love to make them honor their agreement and still cancel the service because it should have not had to go to Executive Customer relations in the first place.

Here is her information if any of you are having similar difficulties:

Comcast Corporate just called me, they are dropping all cable boxes and discounting my internet to $29.99 a month for 6 months (30Mb/s) and then it goes to $44 a month for the rest of the year. Annoying but I'll take it. And I asked for it in writing.

Well 6 days ago Comcast called and said they'd toss in two cable boxes and upgrade my internet for the price I'm paying now.

**THAT WAS A BIG FUCKING LIE**

I get my work order email today and it states ""1 DTA cable box"" So I'm like hmm, I repeatedly asked the rep that I needed 2 cable boxes and pressed him and had him repeat 3 times that there was no monthly fee for the two boxes. Guess what, he's a fucking liar. 

Now I'm back to my $85/m bend over because they are the only ISP in the building plan. I'll post the audio recording I made incase anyone doubts me but I dont think that's going to happen.

Now I've got Comcast corporate contacting me about this. We'll see what they say.

I watch less TV.  I do more ""real life"" stuff.  I save $70/month.  The TV I do watch is better... I watch a lot less mindless crap.

This past weekend I was at a party and the conversation veered towards TV shows, specifically ""guilty pleasure"" (aka horrible, time-wasting, reality) kind of shows.  I was completely lost.  As the conversation went on, I realized that I had *nothing* to contribute.  Kardashians, Housewives, Monsters Inside Me, House Hunters, etc, etc... I was lost.

Before I cut the cord, I knew at least a little about practically every freaking show on TV.  I was plugged in.  I actually really liked knowing what was happening on all of these shows, and the thought of cutting the cord scared the hell out of me at the time.

Being in that conversation this weekend was a reminder of how far I've come and how much my life has improved.  I honestly could not be happier about not knowing what they were talking about.  I felt like I'd been freed.

I have definitely not given up TV.  I've just given up bad, time-wasting, life-sucking TV.

For all of you who are nervous about cutting the cord, don't be.  You won't miss those stupid shows at all.  Not even a little.  You'll be happier.  You'll start to feel sorry for all the people who do waste their time watching that crap.  I can't recommend it enough.

Obligatory: Yes, I pirate things with this setup. I'm also still paying for cable at the moment. I could record everything off the cable feed the ""legitimate"" way, but I can grab it off Usenet and not have to wait for MCEBuddy to strip the ads. The end result is the same. Draw your own conclusions, and use your own feelings about piracy to adjust accordingly.

**The hardware:**

A spare computer. I'm using a 2009 Mac mini running Windows 7. I run it headless, hard wired to my gigabit router.

A WinTV DCR 2650. It's the cheapest CableCARD USB TV tuner. It has 2 tuners, and since it uses CableCARD, it can get any channels your cable box can.

A CableCARD. Provided by your cable company.

(Note: If you don’t have cable, the HD Homerun is a great choice for an OTA tuner.)

Large USB hard drives. These are practically free in specially marked boxes of cereal. I like the bus-powered Seagate drives.

A Slingbox. Watch your TV anywhere.

**The software:**

Plex Media Server. The heart and soul of the entire system. It indexes your media and makes it accessible on all your devices.

SABnzbd. The Usenet client of choice.

uTorrent. When Usenet just isn’t enough.

Sick Beard. Searches for TV shows.

Couch Potato. Searches for movies.

Windows Media Center. The best free DVR.

Remote Potato. Remote scheduling of Windows Media Center recordings from your phone or the web.

MCEBuddy. Strips ads and recompresses Windows Media Center’s excessively large MPEG-2 recordings to more manageable H.264 recordings.

WinTV 7 with Extend. Allows you to watch your WinTV remotely.

**The services:**

A Usenet account. I like Panic's Unison Access.

myPlex. Provides discovery and directory services for your Plex servers.

**The setup:**

*Downloads*

Sick Beard and Couch Potato maintain lists of movies and TV shows you want. They connect to Usenet directory services like nzb.su.

Once one of these apps finds a piece of requested content, they pass the information over to SABnzbd.

SABnzbd downloads the requested content from your Usenet provider and sorts it into the appropriate directories for movies and TV.

All of this is supplemented by uTorrent. No torrent work is automated in this setup, but you can manually add one if you need to.

*DVR*

Remote Potato allows you to remotely schedule recordings in Windows Media Center. When the time comes, Windows Media Center uses the WinTV to record the requested content off cable, just like a Tivo or a cable company-provided DVR.

After the recording is complete, MCEBuddy picks up the newly recorded video. It strips the commercials, recompresses the large MPEG-2 video file into an H.264 file, renames it with a media-server-friendly name, and moves it to the specified directory. The entire process takes a while.

*Media Server*

All of the content is ultimately indexed by Plex Media Server. Plex keeps separate sections for TV, movies, etc, and automatically downloads metadata like cover art, episode titles, and descriptions.

There is a Plex client available for almost any platform. You can access your server from the web, iOS, Roku, and even DLNA devices. The myPlex service provides remote discovery and directory services so that you an access your server remotely without mucking about in port forwarding settings.

*Remote Live TV*

The Slingbox and the Win TV with Extend software allow you to access your live TV stream remotely. They both have clients for major platforms including the web and iOS.

**The Result**

The result is that you now have access to all of your content at any time from any device. Your downloads and DVR recordings are available in any room you add a Plex client (the Roku is a great choice) and come with you on the road in the iOS apps. Plex will even transcode media automatically to sync it locally to your device.

**Some other things you may want to do**

You can use this machine as VPN gateway. Connect it to a VPN in a faraway land, and route your Rokus and other devices through it to circumvent sports blackouts on the official streaming services.

Run CrashPlan on the machine and back up your home computers to it. If you have the extra drive space, it's a great always-on backup solution.

Install a VNC client on the server, so that it can run headless, but you can easily get in and fix the problems that *will* arise.",,False,,t5_2sa6y,1361161606.0,,,True,t3_18qcvn,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/18qcvn/how_i_watch_just_about_anything_i_want_any_time_i/,

Hello HBO, 

I’d like to become an HBO subscriber, but I can’t.  At least not without also subscribing to a TV package that I have no interest in.  

I’m a big fan of many of your series.  Enough of a fan that I’d like to provide financial support for those series.  But, right now, my only options for doing that are very flawed.   I could: 

* Spend $30+ a month on a cable or satellite TV package I have no interest in, then spend another $16 a month to add HBO to that package. 

* Wait 6 months or a year until your original series are released to DVD or BluRay

Of course, I suspect that many customers like me choose the unspoken 3rd option, and freely download your shows moments after they air using P2P networks.  That option can’t really be beat in terms of price, but it doesn’t let me support the type of television you offer.  The type of television I’d like to support. 

So, here’s what I’m asking: create a subscription for people like me.  There are, I suspect, thousands of us.  Let us subscribe to your original series without signing up for a cable or satellite TV package.  Give us a legal option to watch HBO shows as they air, and support the kind of groundbreaking, original content your network produces.  

As I’m sure your aware, there are many ways you could do this.  Through services like iTunes, Amazon Video on Demand, or your own customized distribution network.  Those details aren’t too important.  

What is important, is that on April 17th, I’ll be sitting down with my friends to watch the premiere of Game of Thrones.  I sincerely hope that you’ll provide a way for me to do that legally, in a way that financially supports the production of that series.  

Sincerely, 
A Potential HBO Customer

Unexpectedly, I noticed a number of Google Analytics cookies and data being sent to Google Analytics. [Here is data](http://i.imgur.com/pVAJ8.jpg) from one of the packet captures. 

Ok, so if you see there, it shows it the Analytics account id UA-6111912-14. Now if you look at my.plexapp.com, you see they are using account UA-6111912-13 there so this account definitely belongs to Plex. Apparently Plex keeps web stats of what we browse on our own private servers. Now first of all, I think it is lame that they are even tracking the IP addresses of our servers, let alone our client info, what we watch, when we watch it, etc. 

I also sniffed traffic going to the regular media manager page, I also saw Google Analytics cookies being sent there as well. 

I have been a very loyal Plex advocate since the beginning, but I consider this to be a HUGE violation of our privacy and trust. It really amazes me that anyone there ever thought it was just okay to secretly monitor us. I mean I have tons of pirated movies and tv shows on there, plus home movies (unfortunately no sex tapes) none of which I want tracked. 

I haven't posted on their forums (because I don't want this account linked to that account) but I certainly hope that a bunch of you hop on over there and state your objections to this highly uncool and possibly illegal monitoring. 

EDIT: Just to be clear, I imagine that their intents were innocent, I certainly don't think they are doing anything malicious or creepy with this data, but it certainly was a poor decision to do it without telling anyone and to be able to turn it off (although you can through your web browser). On a side note, I would be interested to know exactly what information they can and do track about our private servers.

A summary of  one man's adventures into /r/cordcutters",loogielv,195,47,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/ppeie/not_only_did_i_cut_the_cord_but_i_jumped_so_hard/,"So I've done it.  Cox cable is no longer supplying my family television, AND if they followed my instructions verbatim, there should be a VOIP cable modem, AND an HD DVR lodged deep in a rectum somewhere. 

It's been an interesting path to navigate, and the adventure isn't over with a mere Cox cancellation.  It most certainly didn't start there, either. 

If we jump back in time 3 weeks, we'll find a loogielv with absolutely zero knowledge of cutting the cord.  We'll find a loogielv that believed XBMC was still only for XBOXes, *torrents* were the ultimate and only choice in acquiring entertainment content, Judge Judy was as easily obtainable as any show, and there would never be a piece of software that would get a donation if it was voluntary and the free version provided everything he needed.

A loogielv, that was horribly ignorant. 

Before I jump into what I finally decided on, and what I'm currently using I should share what my initial concerns and objections were. 

* I needed a way for my wife to view retarded shows that normal people would rather open a Tylenol gel-cap and snort the liquid inside than watch. We're talking Judge Judy, People's Court, Saved by the Bell, Cupcake Wars etc. Real shit shows. Actually, Judge Judy is pretty awesome. You shut your communist mouth.

* I needed to be able to share the media through several TVs within the home, and preferably online with Android devices, laptops, friends and family members.  Like I’m fucking LoogFlix or some shit. 

* I preferred to have all my shows/movies downloaded, instead of worrying about streaming via a shady website.  While saving the space would be nice, I wasn’t about to pay a service like MegaVideos or something, unless majority of Reddit users that have paid would recommend it.  I trust you Reddit…though you’ve taken advantage of that trust a few times…

Really that was it.  I was under the impression that if I set up some really badass RSS feeds, I could automate my torrent downloading, and get all my shows easily.  Hell, I could even tailor some RSS feeds to avoid downloading compressed (rar, zip) files.  While it would still require some interaction on my part, I could automate 80% of it, and ALLLLMOST have my shows ready to watch as soon as they were done downloading.  That’s the best you can hope for, right?  Wrong.  Oh, how wrong I was.  

Reading several threads in r/cordcutters, I heard a few terms very sparingly, and was perfectly happy to pounce right over them without giving them a second thought.  “XBMC” for one. “Who the shit still uses an XBOX to watch media?  It’s friggin 2012.  Newbs.”  

However, many people on r/cordcutters were relying on devices  (ie: Roku, WD TV Live) to serve up their Tall Media Frappuccinos.  I instantly went out and acquired a Roku, just to test the waters.  After playing around with the Netflix app, and a few Plex apps on it, I decided it was pretty cool, and perfect for a children’s room, but wasn’t nearly powerful enough, nor customizable enough for the ol’ Loog-meister. 

I put zero thought into Plex as anything more than a way to serve up “E:\Kids Shit\” to the children’s room. 
I went out and found a WD TV Live and fooled around with it like a willing prom date.  
While I won’t do an official review here, I’ll say I decided on “More powerful than a Roku, less customizable.”  It would easily access network shares, but beyond that, it really didn’t bring anything special to the table.  

Further, the responsiveness of using it, (especially the Netflix app) is maddening.  Homicidal madness invoking.  It’s just not snappy.  There’s a delay when moving the cursor, a delay when selecting file, a delay when opening a Netflix movie…or anything.  To the point where I would gladly keep a Roku around just for the Netflix app.   (Bear in mind, you have to jump through hoops to get a Roku to access media on network server.  The WD TV Live has network share access built in.  Jumping through hoops on a Roku was still preferable to the slow response of the WD TV Live UI.)

I researched the Uebo M400: an unknown in the cord-cutting world, but primed to be a heavy hitter.  It comes with everything from a built-in torrent client to every type of video connection imaginable.  The only thing was, I could NOT find a video review of the UI.  The Uebo requires a Play-On sub, so that meant if I wanted movies I would have to go back to not only paying Play-On, but also paying for MegaVideo or whatever.  More shadiness.  While I wasn’t above it, I at least needed to see the UI in action. (The PlayOn app for the Roku is so laughably disgusting, its not even worth mentioning. It’s dead to me.  it doesn’t exist)  I couldn’t find any sort of video review of the UI, so that sent up red flags.  Moving on. 

“XBMC?  Sigh, maybe it’s more than I thought”.  Boom a whole new world opened up.  I search on Reddit for “xbmc” and stumble onto /r/htpc  and that brings about SABnzbd, SickBeard, CouchPotato and Subsonic. 
I wont officially review those apps here either, as they’re nearly perfect and either you use them, or you don’t use newsgroups.  Period.  

After playing around with XBMC, which nicely serves up my newly acquired (via SickBeard and CouchPotato) library I feel like I’m almost…happy.   Bringing in SubSonic (used to stream all your media to internet devices) for a 3-way like a stripper girlfriend does with her stripper friends to a boyfriend that she’s searching for approval from because she never got it from her father, and I thought I was in love…but I now know…it was merely lust. 
 See, something is missing with XBMC.   For starters, I have no easy way to share my media to the kids room.  The Roku doesn’t have anything that works (at least easily) with XBMC.  I knew Plex Media Server could run to the Roku, but, I felt…dirty, running XBMC and PMS. It just seemed…so dumb. 

Also, having messed with Plex in the past, I was expecting XBMC to have the beauty and ease of navigation that Plex had.  While XBMC is great, on a scale of 1-10, it’s about an 8.  Plex is a solid 9, (and that’s **not** counting the borderline psychic ability to scrape and parse metadata for all types of naming conventions.  Plex could figure out “1st Highst gorsing flim of ALL TIME! LOLOLOL Avatar (not air bending fags) I want 2 bang a Navii until she sqrts blue liquid from her butt hole!!.avi” and make it show “Avatar (2009)” in the Plex Media Server.  That’s impressive.  With SickBeard/CouchPotato, it’s not an issue, so that’s why I’m not counting it, but it certainly bears mentioning).

Also, using the XBMC add-on for Netflix, I needed to change my Netflix account details and I COULD NOT, FOR THE GOD DAMNED LIFE OF ME, figure out how to do it.  I disabled the addon, tried to find the xml file that would hold the Netflix account info...everything.  I was so damn frustrated, I was going to uninstall, and wait for XBMC: Eden to come out anyway, that I figured I’d give Plex Media Center another shot.

That’s it.  I will not be testing Eden, as there’s no need.  Plex Media Server will serve everything to my kids’ Roku, and even better, the beauty of Plex Media Center completely blows XBMC out of the water.  Further, for whatever reason, the playback of movies is brighter and more vivid within Plex than XBMC.  I’m sure I could have made XBMC equally beautiful after tinkering, but I didn’t have to.  Plex said “have a seat Mr. Loogielv..I’ll take over from here.”  Also, I tried to get the colors right in XBMC and couldn’t figure it out.  I figured it was because the XBMC box was hooked to the TV via regular VGA cable, and I would need an HDMI converter.  Nope, Plex fixed it for me.
 
Things I’ve learned: 

* I’ve learned that other than YouTube,  Judge Judy is simply NOT on the fucking internet, anywhere… (There IS a kind hearted soul on IPTorrents that is uploading Judge Judy and People’s Court daily, with some RSS tweaking, I can acquire it daily…I’ll be doing that, even though my OCD screams that either be acquired through SickBeard..OR NOTHING…oh well. The sacrifices we make for our partners…

* I’ve learned that I absolutely am willing to donate to a developer when they both a) blow my mind and b) don’t force me to pay.  When donating is voluntary, as is the case with SABnzbd, SickBeard, CouchPotato, (and subsonic, though it’s forced voluntary) I’m happy to donate.   Those programs deserve my love and admiration.  And yours too. 
* If you run Plex Media Server, Plex Media Center, and SABnzbd on the same box,  you might experience a playback issue every 10 min or so while SABnzbd is repairing and un-rarring in the background (when watching media that’s stored on the same HD as SABnzbd is currently working on.  I’ll be adding an SSD for SABnzbd to use a temp drive to do it’s magic, before copying to the main storage drive.

* If you tell your wife that her taste in television is bad, she will be able to list many…many reasons why 

   a) her taste in television is in fact, good.  

   b) your taste in television is bad   

   c) your taste in music is bad 

   d) your driving abilities are bad 

   e) her taste in men is bad

Protip for Roku users:  The Plex channel is shit.  Install “Plex Grid” channel instead, and all the speed issues go away, and the interface is snappy and beautiful.  The Roku delivers again, which is something special when you consider it’s $99 and really SHOULDN’T be as good as it is.

I knew I would enjoy having the content available on my own personal cloud but I don't think I realized how awesome that would be.  It's amazing to be able to have access to all of my content when I’m out of the house.  I also have unlimited Verizon 4g so streaming to my phone is not a problem either.   Its very nice having access to 6tb of TV/movies available on my phone whenever I want.  Waiting at the DMV the other day was so much better than it used to be.

I love the way it gets all the info about the movies and tv shows as well.  I was really blown away that a free program would work so well and look so good doing it.   Kudos to the Plex team for that.  

I have lived without cable for 5 years now since moving out from my parents.  Now that Plex is set up I can show people how great living without cable is.  For example, I was over at a buddy’s house the other day.   He was bummed because Netflix did not have a show he was interested in.   I said that was not a problem and logged into my Plex account.   Boom, we were watching the show.   He was blown away and is now asking all kinds of questions about Plex and what he needs to get setup.  Expect another member soon cordcutters.  

Anyway, I just wanted to thank you guys for introducing me to Plex, It has completely blown me away over this last month.

I need some help with my current cable service. I used to have the triple service from Time Warner, but earlier this year I decided to ditch the TV and phone service because I don't need it and upgraded my internet service instead. I returned the cable box in early January, and while I was doing so, I told the customer service that I wanted an upgraded internet service, and I asked for my bill. He said my monthly bill should be around $60 per month. 

I trusted the guy, and I also trusted the company for the past 2 years, and I have been enrolled in automatic bill payment. I never checked my bills, until a few days ago when I was tight on money. I discovered that not only they kept charging me for the triple combo, they also added some extra DVR service and add the $60 internet service, which totaled to $189 per month. My question is, can I at least get my money back from the TV related services that I paid after I returned the cable box? I can understand them not willing to refund the extra money I paid for the internet service that I used, but I certainly will not let them rob me for TV service that I CANNOT have used even if I wanted to.

PS: I'm going to their service center today to get my bills reduced. I will try to get my money back, but if they won't give me, I need to know if there is any other way (legal?) that I can take to get it.

Edit: Thanks for the replies guys. I went to one of their centers earlier today and I was being polite as you suggested. They told me they made the order to cancel my original plan but it was never executed. The representative there was nice and very friendly and immediately corrected everything. Now I have over $500 dollars worth of credit with them and that will go towards my future bills.",,False,,t5_2sa6y,1367521707.0,,,True,t3_1djqvd,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/1djqvd/time_warner_cable_tricked_me_into_paying_more/,

1314775637.0,135,self.cordcutters,jzz7t,To any Americans who think their HOA can dictate how they watch TV:,db2,151,16,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/jzz7t/to_any_americans_who_think_their_hoa_can_dictate/,"In spite of what your HOA (*H*ome *O*wners *A*ssociation) gestapo want you to think they *can not* prevent you from installing an antenna. The most they can do is ask for reasonable concealment of it which cannot itself become a burden to installation (cost).

&gt;The rule (47 C.F.R.  Section 1.4000) has been in effect since October 1996, and it prohibits restrictions that impair the installation, maintenance or use of antennas used to receive video programming.  The rule applies to video antennas including direct-to-home satellite dishes that are less than one meter (39.37"") in diameter (or of any size in Alaska), TV antennas, and wireless cable antennas.  The rule prohibits most restrictions that: (1) unreasonably delay or prevent installation, maintenance or use; (2) unreasonably increase the cost of installation, maintenance or use; or (3) preclude reception of an acceptable quality signal.

&gt;Effective January 22, 1999, the Commission amended the rule so that it also applies to rental property where the renter has an exclusive use area, such as a balcony or patio.

&gt;On October 25, 2000, the Commission further amended the rule so that it applies to customer-end antennas that receive and transmit fixed wireless signals.  This amendment became effective on May 25, 2001.

&gt;The rule applies to individuals who place antennas that meet size limitations on property that they own or rent and that is within their exclusive use or control, including condominium owners and cooperative owners, and tenants who have an area where they have exclusive use, such as a balcony or patio, in which to install the antenna.  The rule applies to townhomes and manufactured homes, as well as to single family homes.

* currently have 4 TVs, would consider reducing to 3

* must have high def

* must have DVR 

* already have OTA antenna, but only connected to one TV location

* would really prefer a single, centralized 'hub' for all OTA and streaming content. I assume this would also be the DVR shared by all TV's?

1362749418.0,119,self.cordcutters,19wrus,Roku 3 - Initial Impressions From A Cordcutter,metropolisprime,148,29,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/19wrus/roku_3_initial_impressions_from_a_cordcutter/,"I overnighted a Roku 3 from Amazon, so I got to play with it last night.

I'm not gonna review the Roku experience in general, because - for the most part - the Roku features you've already known about haven't changed that much. It's a streaming box that has a laundrylist of channels, such as Netflix, Hulu, Crackle, Plex, with various games you can buy as well. Tiny box, doesn't use much power, little purple tag.

Here's my review of the Roku 3:

**Speed**: You know how a some people complain about the Roku being a little non responsive? That split second lag between clicking the button and the actual movement? Yeah, that's gone. The Roku 3 is effortlessly speedy. Metadata downloads in Netflix and other streaming video services are buffered more efficiently, because I had a hard time finding any titles without a thumbnail or description. This is of course contrary to the Roku 1 and 2, where the usual problem of waiting for them to load or seeing titles with that familiar 'grey spinner' background was a constant rather than an exception. Loading videos also seems faster; I watched a few episodes of Comedy Bang Bang on Netflix last night, and they loaded a few seconds after I hit play - a little bit of a speed boost from the Roku 2 XS. Also, Super HD just looks awesome. If your internet provider has it enabled, you'll love it. Admittedly, this was available on the 2 as well, but hey. Long story short, Netflix is fast. Hulu is fast. Crackle is fast. Buffering videos is fast. I had a hard time making this thing break a sweat - other than when I tried to change the theme, but that was basically negligible. More on that a little later.

**Bugs**: Furthermore, many folks with a Roku have had trouble with the Hulu Plus channel. On the Roku 3, it works amazingly well. No more 'OHMYGODDON'TPAUSEHULUIT'SGONNABREAK' or lagging screens. I tried to run it through normal usage tests (various menus, pausing, starting, stopping, changing videos) and it passed each time. As of now, I genuinely haven't encountered any issues. I'm glad for that.

**UI**: The new UI is gorgeous. The old one looks clunky compared to the new theme. It looks a lot like the Playstation Store UI, in a good way. Channel discovery in the store will be a lot more efficient, as you can now see a huge selection of the channels when running down categories. Also, the ability to style the Roku a bit more (there's three themes, Purple, Grey and 'Daydream' [which is bright blue with clouds]) is a clever little addition. However, changing the theme to 'Daydream' took a bit of time to do - maybe a minute or two. I don't see myself changing the theme every day, so I'm not terribly worried about it.

**Featureset**: Not many new features on this one (unless you count the new processor, quicker speed, new UI - which will, admittedly, be brought to the 2nd gen Rokus later), other than the headphone jack in the remote. It's a curious little addition and honestly, I dig it. Living with three guys who work various shifts, it's an interesting proposition to be able to sit in the living room and watch stuff on our big TV with headphones in, to not wake anyone. Plugging and unplugging doesn't trip the experience up at all, the transition between plugged in and unplugged is effortless. The volume control on the remote is nice and, on the screen, the volume indicators (when you're plugged in) are not obstructive. I don't think this is a feature that would drive crazy amounts of sales, but it's certainly a really cool one.

**Plex**: Unfortunately, I didn't get much of a chance to test the Plex channel last night (I overnighted some parts for my server too and I have to do some work to it), but I don't foresee any issues with Plex's Roku channel either, considering the hardware and software improvements with the device. I'll hopefully come back to this by the weekend.

**TL;DR**: I fuckin' love it. An amazing progression from the Roku 2 in every realm. I usually have an affinity for the Roku over other devices, but it's just fantastic. For me, it's a cordcutter's standard. Great job, Roku.

EDIT: Fixed my server and tested Plex. It's hecka fast and runs brilliantly. I turned on the theme music option and unlike the earlier units that were a little sluggish, there was no noticeable slowdown.

My wife is 5 months pregnant with our 2nd child after 3 miscarriages after our first child we're pretty sure this baby is going to be ok.  However she is suffering from a separated  pelvis due to the baby which I'm taken to understand is extremely painful.  We cut the cord back in July and have no regrets except that she can't DVR so that she can be active when the pain is low and become a couchpotato when the pain is too much.  I plan on using the HomeRun in conjuction with mythtv and plex to allow her to record shows and watch them again on the roku box.

[Divx Tv Shows](http://ipb.quicksilverscreen.com/index.php?showforum=130)(Medium Quality links most are TV/DVD rips under 720p)

[Flash Tv Shows](http://ipb.quicksilverscreen.com/index.php?s=225a55c6e7d1afe012868b4bdc4f5a4a&amp;showforum=189)(Great for fast buffering and low bandwidth connections)

[HD Tv Shows](http://ipb.quicksilverscreen.im/index.php?/forum/131-hd-high-definition-movies/)(720p/1080p -bandwidth intensive)

They also have movie sections in the forums, but I'm sure you guys can find it yourselves.

**Legality:** The site operates in a legal grey area, since they don't host anything themselves they aren't breaking the law; They link to sites like Megaupload and Movreel. You can find absolutely any TV show you can think of on this site (yes even &lt;ObscureTvShowX&gt; from &lt;ObscureCountryX&gt;), and TV shows are uploaded and linked within minutes of the show airing on TV. Best of all you don't need an account to browse their links, so no credit card bullshit, anyone can just browse the site, if you want to make an account it's free and you will be able to post and contribute links. This site is community run, 99% of the users posting video links are volunteers and as such are not paid.

**Edit1:** I'd also like to say that I don't work for this site, and am in no way affiliated with them but I recommend them to all my friends and family and it changes the way people watch TV... I hope we can get them put on the sidebar.

**Edit2:** Also you guys will probably notice that all the megaupload links in the Divx &amp; HD sections link to a site called mrbrownee70.com. Don't worry it's not an ad... it's a site created by a very active member of QSS, specifically for QSS, so that you can stream from Divx sites using his scripts (the scripts also take care of all the ""captcha's"" and the ""click my if you are human"" buttons).

My wife dropped of the box at the TWC a week ago this past Saturday, with a giant FU, and we have been enjoying the Roku greatly. Almost immediately, the phone calls started coming.

I don't answer numbers that I don't know, but this one was suddenly calling 3-4 times a day and leaving no messages. I decided on a whim to call back late one night, and the bot answering the phones identified them as TWC. I hung up. In the days that passed, they kept calling and it was pissing me off, so I finally decided to answer.

The woman on the line asked me why I cancelled cable, and if I had gone with another provider yet. I told them it was because they were too expensive, and no, I had not. I still really can't believe what she said next: ""We can offer you the same package that you cancelled, on top of your internet, for $3/mo for the next 2 years, no contract.""

As I'm saying WTF in my head and asking her over and over if what I'm hearing is correct, and it is apparently true. r/Cordcutters, it was too good to pass up; HD cable w/a DVR for $3 a month. W. T. F.

The only thing that I can think is that people are ditching them in droves in my area, and they are trying to save some numbers by showing that people are still subscribing. This is awesome and infuriating at the same time, knowing what I was paying and what they are willing to drop down to in price. I guess I'm happy about it, but at the same time feel dirty. Anyone else experience something like this recently?

$75 for internet alone.",ferrarisnowday,123,15,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/r15y8/comcasts_pricing_shenanigans_or_how_im_paying_75/,"Warning you in advance, this is mostly just venting.

Up until last month, I had been paying $104 total for TV (on demand, HD, no premium channels), Internet, and Phone.  In one month, the bill went up to $154, without notice (I was on autopay, so that sucked).  I called, just trying to remove TV, thinking that I could get back to my old rate of $70 total for phone and internet.  This was when I was using Dish for TV...which I would still do if I could.  Dish was great with customer service, but I live in an 1800's apartment so the landlord legally can say no to this (and I'd agree, dishes can tacky things up a bit in historic areas).

So first I try to simply ""lower my bill"" through their online chat. I'm told they can't offer any special deals online (then why have online chat?!) and that the best they could do is get me down to $134/month for the same level of service.  Plus comcast is *terrible* about mentioning taxes, fees, equipment rental, etc...so I doubt it was even that ""cheap.""  The next day I go to Radio Shack and buy a $14 HD antenna to test it out; it's not perfect, but it gets the job done.  I can watch some of the big networks, local news, and some retro TV channels, all for free and most of them crystal clear.  I then find out that Hulu Plus can basically replace Comcast's on demand for most of the shows that I watch (with the added bonus of way more movies), and iTunes can supplement the rest (Walking Dead).  My computer is right next to my TV, so I can hook it up as a second monitor and it will feel pretty similar aside from the lack of remote.  (secondary question, does anybody know if comcast wants their HDMI cables back when you return the box?)

So I try online chat again, simply wanting to remove TV service.  Nope, they can't do that online.  I have to call the 1-800 number between 9 and 5 Monday thru Saturday...great, I have a 8 - 5 job, I'd love to to waste my lunch time on hold!

SO FINALLY, Saturday has rolled around and I called to cancel the TV service.  Incidentally, selecting the automated menu option for canceling service gets you directly to a representative.  Right off the bat he offers me $99 triple play of exactly what I have now...oh but I still have to rent the modem and pay for the HD box...and taxes/fees...so it's *really* $125...no thanks!  But wait, entirely dropping TV only takes me to $99.54 total.  But then I'd have to pay $16.05 for some guy to come out and filter out the TV signal from my line.  The representative informs me that I can get the lowest level of basic TV for just $5 more.  Since I already have decent (but not cable level) quality through the antenna, I decline.

So I'm all set to pay $100 for just internet and phone, but at the last second I ask how much it would cost to drop the phone?  Well if I do that, I lose my ""discount"" on the Internet, so the Internet alone would cost me $65 plus taxes, fees, and modem rental ($75 total).  But they'll waive my $1.99 change of service fee (which was never mentioned by them, I had to ask about it)....yay?

**TL;DR -  It's all a huge racket, and I'm paying $75 for plain internet and another $16 for a guy to come disconnect my service.  Dropping phone and TV entirely, 2/3rds of my service, has only saved me $50 on my bill.  Well, on to modem shopping to avoid the $7 rental fee.  Sometimes I miss the days of dial-up $10 internet...**",,False,,t5_2sa6y,False,,,True,t3_r15y8,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/r15y8/comcasts_pricing_shenanigans_or_how_im_paying_75/,

1368832388.0,105,self.cordcutters,1ejq9j,I wrote a Plex channel for NHL fans,pudds,122,17,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/1ejq9j/i_wrote_a_plex_channel_for_nhl_fans/,"It's pretty raw still, but it does work.

Basically, it searches /r/hockey for game threads and digs inside them looking for VLC streams and allows you to play them back in Plex.

Some notes on how it works and limitations:

1) The channel is at the mercy of the folks who post up the game threads.  I use a few different methods to try and find the streams, but sometimes they are posted in oddball ways and the app can't find them.

2) There are 2 options when you enter the hockey section - Smart List and Full List.  Smart list searches for game threads and tries to intelligently figure out which of the results are actually game threads.  It gets most of them right, so it's a good first option.  Full list shows the first 25 results (from reddit search) which contain the words ""game thread"".  It gets a lot wrong, but if a thread is missed in the smart list, it usually shows up here.

3) There are a few different methods of searching for game streams.  When you first open a game thread up, it searches in the self text for direct links to streams.  This is the best and fastest way, and I call these ""official"" streams.

Sometimes they don't post the streams in the self text though, so if the list is empty, your next option is to go into ""Unofficial streams"".  This option searches the comments in the rss feed, first by best, then by new, looking for stream links.  This option works fairly well as well, but only if the streams are posted early and get upvoted.  If they get posted late, they sometimes don't show up in the 500 comments available in the RSS, and so nothing will be found.

Finally, there is the ""External Streams"" option.  This searches the self post for a link containing the text ""VLC"".  If it finds one, and it's not a stream, it will open up the linked page and look for streams on there.  This option is a bit of a crapshoot, since the external pages tend to go down after a while, and they often contain streams to more than one game.  Eventually I'll filter out games for other teams, but they show up right now.

Typically one of the 3 options will work, in any case, but if they don't, you have one last option - find a stream by hand, and post it in the thread.  If you do that and refresh the list, it should get found in the ""unofficial"" section, but only for a while, once the comment is no longer in the top 500 new posts, the stream will likely disappear again.  Most of the time this is a non-issue though.  For instance, the Pens-Sens game tonight already has a working stream in the self post, and the channel is able to find and load it.

Installing a channel manually is pretty easy - find your PMS data directory (On windows - C:\Users\Name\AppData\Local\Plex Media Server), go into the Plug-ins directory and unzip the file.  (Don't create a new folder, the zip already contains a folder).  I think you have to restart your Plex server after to get it to show up.

Like I said, the app is still really raw, but it works (at least in Plex for Windows and iOS).

Edit: forgot to add, in the channel settings you can select your stream quality and the channel will adjust the URL for you. Default is 3000.

Edit 2:  hooked up my google tv (revue). Works nicely there as well.  ",,False,,t5_2sa6y,1369371348.0,,,True,t3_1ejq9j,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/1ejq9j/i_wrote_a_plex_channel_for_nhl_fans/,

When I disconnect my phone from my network and try to load a video off of 3G/4G, everything speeds back up.

The YouTube speed test shows a wildly erratic connection with several drops hitting dangerously close to minimum bandwidth. A quick test at speedtest.net shows me at 17 Mb/s and 8 Mb/s up. I can stream Netflix at 1080p with no problem, but can't watch a 30 second youtube clip at 240p a minute later.
I've searched the web and found numerous other people having the same problem on Time Warner and AT&amp;T U-Verse as well as more on Verizon. They have suggested fixes, mostly involving blocking certain Google caching servers on my router, but no solution has fixed my problem.

Word is that these ISPs have been throttling YouTube bandwidth to save costs, but I couldn't find any concrete sources to back this up. Does anyone know what is truly behind this and if there is any action I can take to rectify it?

When Netflix signed its agreements with the studios regarding rights to stream content, there were stipulations in those agreements that specified that when the number of streaming subscribers reached a certain point, the contracts could be voided and  renegotiated.  This almost certainly would mean that the studios would opt to cancel out of the current agreement and renegotiate for more money based on the success of the service.

Netflix first started including streaming for little to no additional money as a way to introduce the service and start to gain streaming subscribers.  Since it didn't cost anything additional to have the streaming service in addition to the DVD service, there are many, many subscribers who have streaming included in their plan, but never use it.  In regards to the contracts, these subscribers still count as streaming customers.

Apparently, Netflix was getting very close to eclipsing the number of subscribers specified in their contracts, which would have triggered a review of the terms.  Obviously, Netflix didn't want this to happen... it would have been bad for the company and for Netflix's customers.

So, they separated the plans.  This way, they could reduce the number of streaming subscribers and not have to renegotiate all of their content deals.

I suspect that the vast majority of Netflix customers were *either* streaming *or* DVD, and that the number of customers who consistently utilized both options was relatively small.  Splitting the plans into two types of services made the most sense.

If you want to hate on Netflix for changing it's plans and pricing, go ahead.  But you should at least know *why* it happened.  It wasn't simply a money grab.  In a way, it was a way of avoiding having to raise prices.

***EDIT**: In searching for the source I got this from (it was an article I read a few weeks back, which I can't seem to find now), I've gotten a more complete picture...

Netflix has *many* different contracts with different content providers.  Obviously not all of these contracts are made public.  It does appear that splitting into two separate plans was at least partially an effort to keep some of these contracts from triggering a ""cancel and renegotiate"" clause.  Netflix's agreement with Sony was just terminated exactly because of this.

The splitting of the plans wasn't *solely* because of this reason, though.  Netflix needs more money.  Many of the contracts they negotiated 3-4 years ago are about to expire, and they are all going to have to be renegotiated at *much* higher (like 10x or more) rates due to the enormous success of the streaming service.  So, rates had to be raised, and you can probably expect more rate increases over the next couple years.",,False,,t5_2sa6y,True,,,True,t3_j6w9g,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/j6w9g/for_everyone_who_is_bashing_netflix_about_price/,

**If you don't use firefox it should still work. You just have to turn it on.**

**CHROME USERS** can get similar functionality as the firefox plugin if they download the ilimitux add-on for chrome. **They still need cacaoweb to be running** but illimitux auto detects megavideo links and opens them in a new tab. That should save the hassle of having to copy paste the video link addresses into the cacaoweb interface every time. **All credit goes to rymos for that one. Thanks man!**

1) Add the extension ""Hola Unblocker"" to your browser. I use Chrome.

2) Go to the site: [https://gamepass.nfl.com](https://gamepass.nfl.com)

3) Once there, click the ""Hola Unblocker"" flame and switch to the Netherlands.

4) The site will now reload, unblocked.

5) Now click a game. A popup will open.

6) Now this is where I had to get creative.Mine would only buffer. Forever. So I copied the pop-up link, and pasted it in a Chrome tab.

7) Wait for it to load, and start to buffer again.

8) Now switch Hola Unblocker ""Back to US""

Comcast social media professionals: pay attention, this concerns you.

1.  Arrogance.  Only Comcast tries to make me feel like they're doing me a favor by not charging me for a change to my service.  They mention it over and over in any conversation I have with them, reminding me of their magnanimity.  Changes to my service should be free of charge, unless I make a habit of it.

2.  Bullshit appointment policy.  If you make an appointment, I expect you to be there, at the time you made the appointment.  Imagine what the perception would be if I made an appointment for a job interview, called the employer half an hour before the appointment, and simply didn't show up if they didn't answer the phone.  And then I'd tell them ... ""Oh, I'm sorry, I called you to confirm and you didn't answer the phone.""  Really?

3.  Bullshit price-tiering.  Comcast's offerings are structured in such a way that you need to buy multiple ""packages"" to get everything you want.  This quickly escalates your bill to over $200 per month if you're  a dedicated TV watcher, and a huge percentage of it is worthless garbage.  I don't want to pay another hundred dollars per month to get three channels I want.  I'd be willing to pay per channel, but you won't sell it to me on this basis.  Why?  It's a little difficult to believe that it's a technological limitation at this point.


Comcast, this is why I dropped everything but your internet service, and I'd drop that in ten seconds as well, if I could get a another provider.  Do you really not want the extra $20 to $30 per month I'd be spending with you if you offered services the way I want them?",,False,,t5_2sa6y,True,,,True,t3_r3x8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/r3x8z/why_i_hate_comcast_rant/,

The ""work"" is using Bing search about 20 times a day and accumulating [Bing Rewards](http://www.bing.com/rewards/signup?publ=XX_web&amp;crea=XX) points. These points can then be put towards various prizes including 3-months of free Hulu Plus.

Basically by making Bing search my main search engine I earn more than enough points every 3 months to purchase a free Hulu-Plus membership. In fact I make enough points to also have a free unlimited Zune Music subscription.

All you need is a Windows Live account and the rewards points can be earned using any web browser. So as long as you don't mind using Bing for daily searches it's a pretty easy way to get free Hulu Plus.

**Edit:** **3 month Hulu Plus** subscription requires **694 points**. You can earn roughly **350 points a month** by searching and clicking links. It takes about 2 months to save up enough for a 3 month subscription.

**Edit 2:** Other current rewards relevant to cordcutters include:

* 1 month Zune Pass **547 points**
* 3 month Slacker Radio Plus **547 points**
* 1 month Gamefly subscription **667 points**
* 400 microsoft xbox points **500 points**
* Various giftcards like Amazon.com **500-1000 points**

**Edit 3:** Of course this isn't really forever. As SergeantSlapNuts pointed out the promo ends **12/31/2011.** Thats still enough time to earn about 6 months of free Hulu Plus. I had been using this service for about a year and so my title is a little sensationalized.",,False,,t5_2sa6y,True,,,True,t3_jy5ax,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/jy5ax/though_it_requires_a_bit_of_work_free_unlimited/,

And WHY can't the power button on the remote actually control the power for the device that I have the remote on? If you want a power button for the remote, it would be better served with a small switch on the side or back.

I find out that Blast Plus is 30Mb/s, and they'll throw in 3 cable boxes and 50 channels for $70 a month plus the cable rental fee. 

Well I do what anyone would have done at this point. I ask for it in writing that that's the normal rate, and that it won't go up in 6-12 months. He goes on and on about how that's the normal rate so I bust out the audio recorder. Texas is a state that is single party when it comes to recordings. So I get him to repeat the rates, and that it won't go up in 6-12 months. That's my leverage for if it does.

So I was really surprised to mutter the words ""Yeah that sounds like a good deal, add it to my plan"". My girlfriend jumped up and down when I told her we'd be getting cable boxes soon. 

So if you're a Comcast customer you might want to see if this package is available to you. I'm not only getting faster internet and cable boxes, but I'm paying a tiny bit less a month.

It arrived!,FozzTexx,90,11,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/18bqze/remember_that_android_tv_thingy_from_the_chinese/,"A couple weeks ago [there was a post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/177knv/cheap_android_tv_sticks_on_ebay_i_just_bought_an/) with a link to an eBay auction for some kind of [Android TV thingy](http://i.imgur.com/nrVB5U0.jpg) for a ridiculously low price of $13. I jumped in and bought one without really looking that hard at it because the keyboard/mouse/remote looked cool. I didn't really think much about the price since I had been buying a lot of cheap Chinese made things lately and the price didn't seem all that crazy. Then I looked at the specs and saw it was more powerful than the $35 Raspberry Pi and came back and started looking at the comments.

Everyone on Reddit started commenting how there was no way it was real, pointed out a lot of other auctions the seller had like a 3 Terabyte external drive for $20, 10"" Android tablets for $20-$30, and other things that would never be that cheap. It didn't take long before so many people were reporting the scammer that eBay shut down all his auctions and his account. When eBay shut him down they sent out an email to let everyone who had purchased from him know they should open a case with eBay.

I immediately opened a case and a day later the scammer added a tracking number to the open case to try to keep eBay from taking the money back. eBay said I was going to have to wait until 2 weeks after the scheduled arrival before I could pursue the case further. I expected the tracking number was fake and wondered if he had sent the same tracking number to everyone. A couple of days later eBay emailed and said they had decided the tracking number *was* fake and they were refunding my money.

I left the tracking number in my tracking widget just for the heck of it. For a few days the tracking number didn't work at all. Then suddenly it changed to ""Acceptance"" and a couple of days after that it changed to ""Origin Post is Preparing Shipment."" It stayed that way for a very long time and I was starting to wonder how long it would be until I was tired of the same status message and stopped tracking it. Suddenly though the tracking changed and the item was in the US!

Well the Post Office finally delivered it, [and here it is!](http://i.imgur.com/dvzhKfi.jpg) It's definitely **not** as seller described and I'm glad eBay refunded my money.

I wanted to thank you for all the information available in this subreddit.  I've only lurked, but with all the information in here, I successfully got my parents to cut the cord, ditching Bell TV and saving over $100 a month! (~$120, down to an average of $20 a month)

My parents now have a Roku 2 XS, a subscription to unblock-us.com, Netflix US and Amazon Prime. For all their local news, they have an OTA Antenna as well. 

**Cost Breakdown**  
Amazon Prime - $80/Year or ~$6.67/Month  
Netflix US - $8/Month  
Unblock-US.com - $5/Month  
**Total Cost:** ~$20/Month

My parents are so happy and this has come at the perfect time for my parents, as my dad has recently retired.

So, I just wanted to say thank you!",,False,,t5_2sa6y,False,,,True,t3_1090vx,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/1090vx/just_a_thank_you_to_the_cordcutters_community/,

[The MVPS Hosts file](http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm) is, as the name implies, a HOSTS file.  It's goal is to provide a blacklist in the form of a hosts file so that these locations are never accessed by anything on your computer that accesses the Internet (so it isn't limited to just browsers).  In addition to blocking ads, it makes a decent attempt to maintain a list of domains that are known to distribute malware or perform aggressive 3rd party traffic.  Basically, it takes all of these naughty locations and tells your DNS resolver to look for those locations on your local machine, so that none of them will load no matter what is requesting that resource or how it is requested.

Some caveats: It's pretty aggressive in what it blocks, things like Google Analytics, Hulu ads (which can be annoying since the black screen of silence lasts longer than the actual ads), and it shouldn't be considered the only line of defense against malware.  It's also not terribly easy to whitelist things if you want to selectively allow ads, since you have to find all of the servers that provide the ads for the service in question and comment them out in the file.  It also won't update its blacklist automatically; you'll have to periodically visit the site to see if there's a new version.

But the good news of it is that it does a great job of killing ads, scamware, and trackers (including all of the stuff that shows up on sites like FirstRowSports and other less-than-stellar streaming sites).  And it does it for *everything* that's Internet-enabled on your computer, instead of requiring plugins and other solutions in the form of running processes that work actively instead of passively.

Bonus:

If you're on OS X, there's a really great open source app called [Gas Mask](http://code.google.com/p/gmask/) that allows you to manage HOSTS files, letting you quickly edit, switch, and combine many different hosts files on your system.  This is awesome for things like Hulu, where I prefer to have the ads enabled so that the breaks don't last as long.  I simply switch to a HOSTS file that doesn't contain the MVPS list, and relaunch my browser.  They maintain an old version that works under Leopard.  Current version works on Mountain Lion, even though they only say Snow Leopard.

No idea if there's an equivalent HOSTS management app for other OS's.",,False,,t5_2sa6y,False,,,True,t3_18nwve,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/18nwve/if_you_dont_already_you_should_know_about_the/,

I want to focus instead on Comcast's [claim](http://blog.comcast.com/2012/05/comcast-to-replace-usage-cap-with-improved-data-usage-management-approaches.html) that using more than 300GB per month is ""far above any normal (including very heavy) residential use of our high-speed data service"". A number of news sources I read took no issue with this claim. So how hard is it to use 300GB?

Youtube 720p video is 1.3GB an hour

Netflix video is between 1 and 2 GB, let's say 1.5GB an hour

An HD itunes movie is 4GB

Each downloadable game with a patch or two is easily 10GB

OS updates or reinstalls can be 5GB

The average american watches [159](http://mashable.com/2011/06/15/nielsen-video-study/) hours of TV a month, so fully switching over to Netflix would mean 237GB. Add a second person and you're easily over.

Or take this scenario: 100 hours of Netflix, 16 hours of Youtube, 4 iTunes movies, 3 downloaded games, 2 OS updates, and misc usage (Skype, backups, online gaming) of 25GB. That's 250GB. As 1080p becomes more prevalent online, you're way over 300GB.

These are not the mean or median usage scenarios. There are a number or people who barely use the internet for every household like this.

I'm also disabled as well, and I am currently receiving Social Security. My mother is in the process of getting approved as well, but something unexpected came up where she has to wait two more months for a decision.

I've been holding up the bills with my small amount of money a month, but I feel extremely squeezed because the winter was bitter fucking cold and my electric/gas bill has skyrocketed ridiculously.

Anyway, enough of my pity party story.

I have a triple package with Comcast right now, currently spending $140 a month for everything. But to be honest...I really want to kill my cable, because I barely watch it, and my mom...she mostly sticks to local channels and/or a few cable channels like, FX, TNT, etc...etc...

I was basically planning on getting rid of both of my cable and phone, and just relying on the internet. I explored some alternative options for both of them, including hooking up a older computer I have and putting Magic Jack on it for phone, and basically relying on my Xbox 360 for entertainment.

I re-subbed to my Xbox Live Gold, plus I re-instated my Netflix. I was planning on trying out Hulu plus...and CrunchyRoll for some of my anime needs. I was also eventually thinking about getting Amazon Prime, as it's only $80 bucks a year, and also I do order stuff from them from time to time.

I have a few concerns on the matter, however. Is there a way that my mom can keep up with local news...she doesn't like to read articles...but pretty much the news in video form? I'm not too sure if I have basic cable...I've been thinking about calling Comcast and asking them about that once I cut the cords, but there is that sinking feeling...

Also, are there any negatives for cutting the cord? I need to explore all scenarios because I'm in an almost fragile financial situation and I'd love to start saving money so I can get some things done...such as getting my mother's car fixed and such. I really can't afford into making anymore mistakes...but sacrifices must be made.

Thanks for reading guys, and please give me the best advice you can so I can finally feel free again.",,False,,t5_2sa6y,False,,,True,t3_1cuqpa,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/1cuqpa/soseriously_thinking_about_cutting_cords_to_both/,

After browsing for 2 hours on my PC, I found about 5 shows I would be interested in watching.  I added them to my favorites and later that night I sat down in bed and got ready to try it out.  I went to my ""Favorites"" section and noticed that on 3 of the shows I have added to my list, there was a little ""Web Only"" tag. 

Frustrated by that I decided to watch Family Guy, as it didn't have the web only tag.  I started the episode got comfy and... wait... is that and advertisement?!  Seriously?  I thought at the time it might just be at the start of the program, but I was wrong.  Today I decided I would watch one of the shows that was web only on my computer, only to find out the whole series isn't even there.  It's 2 random seasons in the series. 

I don't see what the point of HuluPlus is at this point.  Well over half of their television content is ""Web Only"", and even if you don't mind sitting in front of a computer, or you own a HTPC, it's probably only a few episodes from a random season in the series.  

One of the biggest problems with the service, is that you are basically paying for something you can get for free.  Almost all of the new major shows they offer are available on those shows network websites.  ABC, NBC, and FOX all offer this for most of their current programs.  

I would be completely fine with a few ads if they would simply offer their shows and movies across all platforms, and they offered them in their entirety.  

All in all I was pretty let down.  I was really hoping for something that might be an alternative to my satellite dish.  The only decent selection of anything I found on HuluPlus was Anime, but again, well over half of that is web only content.  For now I will stick to my satellite and Netflix.

Mainly to save money, but another was to get away from all the crap that is on TV nowadays. My degree gives me an appreciation of the Entertainment Industry and I have no problem spending money on the raw talent and work put into making the shows we all know and love. My problem has always been with Cable Companies and major studios who only care about the money each show can earn. By cutting the cord, however, we are still depriving funds to the very people who these shows possible.


What I would like to see is a system for donating money directly to the teams of people responsible for making these shows. We need to give them a reason to disconnect themselves from all the bullshit of major studios, while still providing them with the funds to do their jobs. In the past, this was not efficiently feasible, but with advent of the Internet, microtransactions can be economical.


I know nothing of the possible difficulties of bypassing major studios, or the technical skill to create a website like this. I just want to know I'm not the only one that feels this will be needed in the future.

I had one of the original Roku HD boxes, loved it for years but it was getting a little bit slow.


Opened the box.. If I thought the first Roku was tiny, this thing is half the size. Literally fits in the palm of my hand. Unplugged my old roku and put this one in its place, reusing the HDMI cable. Powered on.

In seconds the Roku Logo appeared and immediatley I could tell how much higher quality graphics this was going to be. Took me about 1 minute to type in my wifi password, then another minute once it was connected for it to do a software update and reboot.



It automatically downloaded all the channels I had installed on my old Roku, including private channels and the elusive ""Grandfathered in"" You Tube channel (I was concerned about this)


My 5 year olds were dying to try Angry Birds, but first I wanted to check out how Plex performed.. Happy to report it was like LIGHTNING. I didnt even have to set anything up - it found my server automatically - and with 0 hesitation I had clicked into my TV shows - it's like it didn't even have to load all the cover art or episode snapshots - and I've got a good 50 different shows on there.


Setup netflix and amazon, checked it out - looked good, as expected just faster.


Then ok, fine you screaming kids can try Angry Birds.. Let them play a couple levels then realized... Wow this remote is heavier and certainly going to be more expensive than the original one when they eventually break it, as 5 year olds do.. So I took out the remote from the original Roku..  IT WORKS!  Obviously not for Games (which isnt why I have Roku anyway) but the kids can use that thing to pick their shows all they want.


I had originally bought this with the intention of putting it upstairs in the bedroom so I could use the headphones (which also seems to work very well) - but it's just too good.

We didn't have a TV at the time, but it turns out that this bundle actually included cable as well as internet. When I got a TV for Christmas, I realized that we had had a cable box all along, and hooked the box up to the TV.

Three months later and we've hardly watched cable at all. Our Roku+Plex takes care of all our TV watching needs, and having cable just seems like it's more trouble than it's worth. Our bundle promotion expired, and we're now paying $70 a month for our internet + HD cable service. I am desperately looking to decrease costs.

However, when I called Comcast to pull the plug, I was informed that by switching to an internet-only package, I would be breaking the bundle, and the monthly price would *increase* to $80 dollars a month. The customer service representative advised me to keep the cable box, saying that it's *cheaper* for me to have a bundle than just one service. She also recommended that I call them again in a few months, and they might be able to get me a new promotion for $39.00 a month.

This makes no sense to me whatsoever! Has anyone else got experience with this? As hopeless as Comcast's customer service has been, I've never had any complaints about their internet service, and so I'm not really looking to switch providers.

I will update this as they are updated, please let me know if I am forgetting anything.

Note: This list is primarily concerned with services that let you (semi) permanently own content.  For a list of free and subscription based streaming services you should consult the [spreadsheet on the sidebar](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnO2JrGmy0OKdEx0UlBlOXdPd0dRYlhBcGdSS1l6V3c&amp;hl=en_US#gid=0).

----------------------------------------------------------------


###Amazon Video on Demand / Amazon Instant Video###


**Pros**

- A massive movie and tv library, has some videos that Vudu doesn't
- HD versions automaticaly grant a viewable SD version
- Newer kindles will show you data about the movie you are watching as you see it.
- Amazon prime owners can get a lot of streaming titles through this service.

**Cons**

- Content can be disabled or removed due to legal disputes with providers
- PC Web interface could use a little cleaning up
- Harsh download limits

**Supported Devices**

- Ps3
- Xbox
- Roku
- iOS
- Kindle Fire
- TV's Via HDMI out
- PC's

**Streaming Rules**

- Stream to two clients at any given time
- No stated limit to amount of clients.

**Streaming Quality**

- Medium quality 720p, looks great on the kindle fire
- When loading your movie on a TIVO, it can be loaded at 1080p
- Will allow HD playback on PC with some titles.

**Download Limits**

- Requires the Amazon Unbox app to download to PC, heavy DRM
- Allows only 2 downloads to Amazon Unbox, and 2 to older media players
- Unlimited downloads on kindle fire.

**Summary**

- An easy choice if you already have a kindle or you have a lot invested into Amazon already.
- An iPad app was recently released so an Android app MAY be on the way, but that is pure speculation.

----------------------------------------------------------------


###BestBuy CinemaNow###


**Pros**

- A massive movie and tv library
- Easily the best mobile app of the bunch
- A very slick PS3 app
- An amazing looking web app
- A disc to digital program $2 to convert, $5 to upconvert

**Cons**

- Limited selection of TV shows (only S4 of community, no office)
- Very harsh sounding terms of use (implies termination of content or the entire service at any given time)

**Supported Devices**

- Ps3
- Xbox
- iOS
- PC's
- Android

**Streaming Rules &amp; Download Limits**

- You only get 5 licenses and each time you download a movie a license is lost forever
- Only one activated device may be streamed to at any given time (does not apply to ultraviolet titles granted from other services).
- I am testing to see if this 5 download limit applies to tablets

**Streaming Quality**

- Full quality 1080p, (requires intel DRM on PC)
- Still testing other methods

**Summary**

- Has the best looking and by far the most useful and complete apps of any service
- TV selection is very limited (for now)
- Be ABSOLUTELY sure that you do not use up your download limits for any particular title, otherwise you will lose all access to the title, even streaming.

----------------------------------------------------------------


###Google Play Movies and TV###


**Pros**

- Excelent and very clean interface.
- Very easy to download and view content offline from an Android device.
- Has a very large selection of rentals.
- Your personal MP4 videos stored on your device are integrated into the app interface and are easily accessible.


**Cons**

- A lot of movies are rent-only or unavailable altogether.
- Some movies are listed through third party sources such as crackle and purchased copies will be lost if the lister loses the rights.
- Needs a tab that compiles all the offline movies and tv shows for easy access.
- Requires a Google TV or a Miracast streaming device to display beyond an Android device.


**Supported Devices**

- Android Tablets and Phones
- PC's
- Google TV
- Regular TV's via HDMI out / Miracast


**Streaming Rules**

- Is automatically tied to your Google Account
- 5 Devices authorized for offline playback
- Stream to 3 devices at a time

**Streaming Quality**

- Medium quality 720p, looks excellent on tablets and smartphones.
- Only allows for standard definition on PC's

**Download Limits**

- Downloads only to Android devices (select the white thumbtack on each video you wish to download and it will slowly turn blue)
- Unlimited downloads

**Summary**

- This service is much better suited to renting movies than it is to owning them.
- It is likely that more content will be added in the future but not garaunteed.
- This is good for frequent travelers who like to keep up with their shows on the go.


----------------------------------------------------------------


###iTunes###


**Pros**

- The only digital service where you actually own your content
- Pretty much all content is available
- Digital copies from physical DVDs/BluRays can be applied to your account
- Can be streamed across iOS devices via Airplay


**Cons**

- No digital locker or cloud streaming available
- iCloud does not permit the storage of videos for backup
- Some people disapprove of iTunes for cumbersome software.
- Investing in Apple means that you are required to use Apple mobile devices to view your content, none of the video content is transferable to Android or Windows Phone.

**Supported Devices**

- PC's
- iOS devices
- Apple TV

**Playback Quality**

- iTunes HD videos are downloaded as 1080p (so long as your system supports it) and since they are stored locally you do not have to worry about streaming quality, only how powerful your local wifi router is.

**Summary**

- You are either invested in Apple or you aren't, if you are it is the only way to go.
- Be sure to back up your content locally if you use this service, it cannot be restored.


----------------------------------------------------------------


###Vudu###


**Pros**

- A massive movie and tv library, has some videos that Amazon doesn't (eg Indiana Jones).
- DVD's and blu rays can be added to the service for $2 or upgraded to HD for $5.
- Can add DVD's to the service directly from your home PC by inserting them into your drive.
- Some ultraviolet codes packaged with DVDs can be redeemed on the service.
- Gives you 10 random movies when you create an account.


**Supported Devices**

- PS3
- Xbox
- Roku
- iOS Tablets (via web-app)
- Some Android Tablets (unoficially others via a modified APK).
- Some DVD players


**Streaming Rules**

- Only 5 devices can be registered, but all can stream simultaneously.

**Streaming Quality**

- Movies that say HD will stream at 720p with Dolby 5.1
- Movies that say HDX will stream at 1080p with Dolby 5.1
- In nearly all instances HD and HDX are the same price
- Allows for some HD playback on PC's however it requires monitors with special DRM known as HDCP to prevent you from recording.

**Download Limits**

- You can download Vudu movies to basically every platform it is available on.
- Downloads can be 1080p on all platforms that support it (even PC).
- Movies can be downloaded an unlimited amount of times

**Cons**

- Terms of service state that content can be suspended by the sudios but not totally removed
- Uses a poor web interface for Android instead of a real app
- Some content is not viewable on PC or tablet.
- Is owned by Wal-mart which is a problem for some people.


**Summary**

- Should be used if you already have a large DVD library and like to have quick access to them.
- Ultraviolet backing means that (most) of your purchased content is secure and some of that content can actually be transferred to some other services (in the future).
- There is a ""special"" version of the app that allows for playback on unsupported android devices but the interface does not scale and it is very difficult to use on phones.

After reading everyone's comments and researching, I settled on the Winegard FlatWave FL5000C Antenna from Costco, and it works great. We didn't even have to put it in the window, next to it was enough for 12 clear channels. Very glad we went with one that has an amp, because we don't get anything when it's unplugged (surely due to being in the basement). 

So assuming it doesn't break anytime soon, I would definitely recommend the FlatWave to someone in a similar situation.

We watch TV but our main sticking point up to now has been our love for sports.

So today I began pricing out what it would cost to watch NFL, NBA and MLS online. The numbers are surprisingly varied.

NFL is $250 from DirecTV, meant for cases where you can't get satellite tv. That's to watch every game the entire season. Pricey but for the NFL fan, worth it.

NBA has two options, the cheaper is $120 which allows you to subscribe to 5 teams (rather than the whole league.)

MLS is of course the smallest, being just $35 for the season.

MLB is also super reasonable, apparently just $24.99 for the full season and the ""premium"" setup. A cheaper $19.99 option is available.

We also love watching Euro soccer games, so I found FoxSports2Go, which is $170, but provides EPL as well as a few other international soccer leagues.

The first three are the most likely for us, I included the other two for completion sake. Meaning we'd spend just over $400 for year round sports. If we skip the NFL and just hit the sports bar then it's down to just $150.

For non-sports there is of course Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hulu. We're already subscribers to Amazon Prime, that's $70 a year. Netflix and HuluPlus are both $8 a month, or $96/year. So using all three is $262 a year. Likely we'd skip HuluPlus by use of an HD Antenna. Sure we wouldn't have a fancy DVR but I'm sure I can find a computer based solution.

The sole remaining obstacle is HBO. You can't get HBOGO without a cable tv account. Sure we could pirate, but that goes for everything on this list, so it's an invalid argument. I'd hate not having HBO but until they offer a cord cut solution that's where we stand.

As for the cost of it.

* Sports: $405 (NFL + NBA + MLS)
* Entertainment: $166 (Netflix + Amazon)
* Total: $571 / year

Next of course was looking at my TV &amp; Internet bill to see what would be saved. If we cut the cable, it would cause our internet to go up since we had bundled them. I'm guessing it'd go up 50% so go to roughly $60/month for internet, but we'd stop spending $80 a month for our cable.

Looks like it would net us nearly $400 a year without sacrificing a great deal of on demand services.

There are a few incidental start up costs, like an HDTV Antenna, and probably a Roku box. We have a WDLive box, but it doesn't interface with services like Amazon Prime or some of the sports channels. But for just $50 a Roku streaming box will interface with almost all of the services (just missing the DirecTV NFL.) On the whole though, those early hardware costs are easily recovered over the next year or so.

Additionally most of these services will be on our phones and Katie's ipad, thus meaning we can enjoy the entertainment outside of the house. On the road, or in the gym, etc.

I'm really coming around to this idea after sitting down and running the numbers.

That's usually channels 2-13 at minimum, analog. If you plug your TV in to the cable and (with it set to ""cable"" not ""air"") flip channels for a while you should be able to get those channels. Some providers throw in more, intentionally or otherwise.. you may even be able to get Nickelodeon.

Also for those of you with digital TVs/boxes the same applies. You can probably tune in a bunch of digital stuff through the cable, though in my experience it's your local channels, a bunch of public access channels, and a few goodies like (no guarantees here) Discovery or similar. *[edit]* I forgot to mention that the digital channels may be in HD too. They were for me. *[/edit]* You need a tuner that's ""Clear QAM"" capable so those boxes that had the government coupon will *not* work for this, they're OTA only.

And for the few of you that like to speak before thinking this isn't ""stealing cable"". You're paying for it as part of the internet package. They can't get service to you without getting service to you, so use it.

For 3 years I had DirecTV ($95/mo) and *[Insert Evil ISP Name]* Internet ($60/mo).

With the rise of Internet-based TV show streaming, and *other methods* of acquisition, I couldn't justify the DirecTV cost any longer.

About one month ago I canceled DirecTV, but kept my cable Internet service.

I tested the cable connection in my bedroom by connecting it to the TV there.  I received no channels when I scanned...

After building and installing my own DB4-style antenna, I was able to receive 9 digital channels, four of them being HD (including NBC &amp;amp;amp;amp; 
Fox).

As I prepared to build my HTPC for DVR functionality, I cleared out some space in my media cabinet.

While I was in there, out of curiosity, I took the cable connection from my modem and connected it to my TV (which has a digital tuner).
I went through the channel setup and began scanning.

*I knew I had tried this up in the bedroom, but I just realized that I hadn't verified cable connectivity to the jack in that room, so I figured I owed it to myself to try again from a verified ""live"" drop*

To my surprise, and delight, over 400 digital / 40 analog channels were found (many of the digital channels are music stations or non-HD duplicates of HD channels).

This is a new home, and I am the only owner, so I know this isn't some service carry-over from a previous tenant.

Also, I brought my DirecTV equipment with me when I moved in, so There has never been a *[Insert Evil ISP Name]* TV package at this address.

Then I expanded my research to include other consoles, because why the hell not? And finally, I added a row for cable boxes, because I wanted to know if my decision to cut the cord had not only eliminated my cable bill, but also decreased my energy bill (something that I had never even considered).

* Keep in mind the fact that [the average American household with cable has two set-top boxes](http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/settopboxes.pdf) (one DVR plus one regular box), so you should really double the first row to get a more accurate view of cable's electricity costs. 

* I list the ""usage times"" for both cable boxes and Rokus as 24 hours/day because the ""standby"" mode in each uses [almost exactly the same amount of power](http://gigaom.com/2011/08/08/energy-consumption-of-connected-devices/) as the ""on"" mode. I don't know if this is still the case with the Roku 3, but I'm assuming it is until someone proves otherwise. 

* The baseline usage time for the other devices (4 hours/weekday, 16 hours/weekend) is based entirely on my own average use as a 24-year old male who shares the TV with his girlfriend (we are both out of the house from 7:30 AM to 5:30 PM every weekday). And I'm only referring to the amount of time that the console is being used as a streaming device.  

* I'm using [first-generation power ratings](http://www.hardcoreware.net/reviews/review-356-4.htm) for the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 in the non-S/Slim rows. There have been multiple iterations of each console and each iteration decreased the power usage somewhat, so if you have a model that is newer than first-gen but older than the S/Slim version, you can split the difference between those two rows and get a fair estimate of your console's actual power usage. 

* The electricity cost is based on a charge of $0.13/kWh, which is the standard rate where I live. [The average rate in the U.S. is $0.12/kWh](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/10/27/141766341/the-price-of-electricity-in-your-state), but it fluctuates wildly from state to state and is actually tiered in some places based on your usage, making the ""average"" number somewhat useless.

They currently don't have the ability to show you the current month's usage, but it will starting in May.

Later Time Warner!,coopooc,67,7,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/gnhyb/i_did_it_later_time_warner/,"After a few months of planning I put all the pieces together and this morning I called Time Warner to cancel my cable service. I should save around $80 a month. 

Here's the details if you're interested:

- I purchased an antenna (kit) from a local place that included a large (nearly 10 feet) UHF antenna to pick up fringe stations about 60 miles away and two small VHF antennas for the closer stations. I installed all of this in the attic mounted to two masts (cut pieces of electrical conduit mounted to rafters). The kit included a UHF/VHF combiner. I used an amp I already had to make it through the cabling in the house. I pick up about 25 channels including the sub-channels (3.2 etc.) with the major broadcast networks all represented. All stations tune in crystal clear with no digital artifacts. In fact, I think the HD might look better than my Time Warner signal. Possibly due to compression?

- I have a TivoHD that we'll continue to pay for service on. Most of the shows we watch are still on the main networks so this will continue doing its job as before. 

- I bought a boxee box to watch netflix (which we already use a lot), rent movies on vudu and watch ripped DVDs. Hopefully we'll eventually have hulu plus (If I decide it's worth it) and amazon vod but I'm not sure all of those services will make it to the boxee box. It's always a guessing game with them.

- Live sports is still an issue as well as a handful of other shows not streamed online or on netflix or VOD. Those might have to be worked on by other means.

1333142162.0,52,self.cordcutters,rlhyg,Loogie’s HTPC beginner’s guide: Part 0: Why you should cut the cord and what your expectations should be,loogielv,66,14,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/rlhyg/loogies_htpc_beginners_guide_part_0_why_you/,"***Part 0:***

I will be creating a series of newbie guides detailing my process of cutting the cord, and building my HTPC.  Not just to too my own horn, but because there are so many questions and so many people who are apprehensive when it comes to cutting the cord.  Nobody says “that sounds like a dumb idea. I’d rather keep paying cable” yet only a small fraction of people actually take the plunge.  

There are only a few reasons to keep someone from cutting the cord:

* **No money to invest in new systems.** It’s cheaper to pay cable $150 this month, instead of dumping $700 into a new system, to avoid paying cable next month (and every month after)

* **It’s complicated: and skurry.**  People are apprehensive about learning new technology and new ways to get data that is already being pumped into their house via cable.  It’s easy to just do nothing.  It’s hard to think about where you’re going to get your next baseball game or having to search for the new episode of Dexter every friggin week. 

* **“It’s illegal”**  People actually believe it’s illegal to download movies and shows.  If you do it right, it’s not illegal at all.  Buy the movie and most times you’ll get a free digital copy to save in your new media server.  If you want all the movies and shows without paying, well then yeah, you’re breaking the rules.  Make that call yourself. 

*  **~~Their wives are assholes.~~** **Their NON-REDDITOR SPOUSES are assholes** *note: Please see the ""I'm an asshole edit"" to see my justification for saying such things... Women of Reddit, please don't write me off as a sexist idiot and continue reading.  I'll make it up to you. I promise!* More accurately, their wife knows that they take on stupid projects that go nowhere, and most likely will end up with parts all over the bedroom floor and in debt too much to afford Taco Bell.  

Those are all I can think of, and honestly, they’re all wrong, and all stupid. All of them are stupid.  Even the wife one.  Once you install a test media server on your own personal computer, without buying any new parts, and show her how easy it is to get “The Hills” and “Desperate Housewives” she’ll be happy.  Trust me. 

The only one that makes halfway sense is the money issue, but if you got a computer (which you are using right now to get on Reddit, so you do) you can, in all honesty start the process and get yourself a damn good little media server running, for free! 

As far as learning new technology, fuck you.  You learn to use Facebook every damn time they make a change.  If you can do that, you can learn this.  It’s seriously that easy.  And once it’s set up, we’re talking LITTLE TO NO interaction at all.  It’s a cakewalk.

As I create these newbie guides, **it’s important for you to know that I am a newbie.**  I know so little about media, about audio/video files, and what their parameters mean, that I should be ashamed I’m even writing these guides.  I only barely learned what “lossless” means and how it affects my music experiences.  I’m telling you, on a scale of 1-10, if being more than proficient is a 10 (not even good, just better than proficient), I’m a fucking 1.  I swear that. 

When it comes to general computer savvy, I’m somewhere closer to “better than proficient”.   I’m a computer tech, I’ve ran my own repair business, so I’m not ignorant and actually quite good, but I don’t keep up with new tech, I don’t’ know what is so special about the new Sandy bridge Intel processors coming out, and I don’t care.  I don’t have a clue what the newest best video card is, and I don’t care.  I don’t know DICK about Linux or anything other than Windows, and I’m not even that good with Windows 7.  I’m a genius with XP, but that’s nothing to brag about.  And I don’t care about learning Linux or any other OS for that matter. 

So, if I can do this, so can you. I promise, in fact, I swear it on things I love.  If LoogieLV is capable of doing this, so are you. 

As far as what your expectations should be, that depends on what you want to get out of your system.  You can merely enhance your cable experience, by building a system to capture incoming cable signals, but that’s not cutting the cord.  If you’re willing to completely cut the cord, between online services, and downloading your own media, you can completely replace cable and never, EVER even miss it.  You’ll never look back, and you’ll never understand why you waited so long to cut the cord. This is not a nerd, tech genius thing as rare as the nerd in movies that built a computer system that talks to him and is self aware. (“Brainscan” style) .  This isn’t like installing a hard drive in your brain and using it to smuggle data between large corporations, thus causing you to delete your child hood memories for space (“Johnny Mnemonic” style)  This is about as techy as setting up a lan party and playing Duke Nukem with your kids. This is as techy as connecting your PS3 to Netflix and a Bluetooth headset.    

**tl;dr**  If you seriously need a tl;dr then you don’t care enough to cut the cord. Simple as that.  However, I’ll use the tl;dr  to drive my point home: The gist of this post is, you can, and should cut the cord.  Your reasons to the contrary, are stupid, and are just holding you back.  Don’t be stupid .  Be a cable cord cutting motherfucker, motherfucker!


edit: [Part 1a](http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/rln4c/loogies_htpc_beginners_guide_part_1a_where_to_get/) is now up.

**I'M AN ASSHOLE EDIT: So, the truth is, girls do exist on the Internet, and quite honestly, all the best of them are Redditors.  The other truth is when a Redditor pitches something like this to their spouse, and gets flack, it's because their spouses are assholes. There's something about Redditor's...If we can't marry Redditors, we like to marry assholes. Truth. So when I say their wives are wasting their life watching Desperate Housewives, I was saying mostly for teh lulz.  The fact is, if a Redditor wife is pitching cord cutting to a husband that is saying no, it's because he's probably worried ""Andy Griffith"" won't be available, or ""Dancing with regular nobodies"" or ""Toddler's and Tiaras"" or whatever the fuck else is rotting his brain.  I said ""wives"" because I just forget women frequent Reddit.**

**In fact, like most Americans, I am usually taken aback when I found out someone is not a white, American, straight male of the age 25-32, especially someone who is discussing my same likes/dislikes.  I'm ignorant, and I apologize to the women for being an asshole...but...some people are assholes :)**",,False,,t5_2sa6y,True,,,True,t3_rlhyg,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/rlhyg/loogies_htpc_beginners_guide_part_0_why_you/,

City-boy me scoffed at DSL (and AT&amp;T), and tried to find some other way to get internet.  Nothing came of that, so I gave up and called AT&amp;T.  AT&amp;T was only too glad to sell me internet, and so in a few days I received my modem in the mail and it worked great!  6M down in the country!

4 days later, I had no connection.  I called tech support, and after 3 hours on the phone (or maybe it was three days, I was stoned on painkillers after having my wisdom teeth removed) I was told that DSL couldn't reach the house, so my order had been canceled.  They were stunned when I told them I had been using it, and that there had been an internet connection there for years.  But, they couldn't turn it back on because it was simply impossible for DSL to reach the house.

In the end, the only way I could get AT&amp;T to serve that house was to ask my girlfriend's mom to call AT&amp;T, uncancel her service, and then pay her bill myself.  And it worked!  So that's what I've been doing for the last 2 years.

Now, I was looking at houses out in the country myself recently, driving the realtor insane because I required an internet connection other than dial-up or satellite.  I finally found a house I liked, and on the ad it said ""High speed internet"".  I checked Roadrunner.  Nope!  AT&amp;T U-verse.  Nope!  Verizon whatever-Fi.  Nope!  Had my realtor ask the selling realtor exactly what ""High Speed Internet"" actually meant.  The answer?  ""Well, the house is owned by a pair of old folks who have never had internet.""  So, ok, that guy is a liar, and it's up to me to find internet.  

I called AT&amp;T first.  They said they had no idea if they could serve DSL there, and had to run a line test and they'd call me back in 2 days.  OK, whatever.  There's also this company called Internet America that resells DSL in the country by beaming it to a receiver on your house using microwave radio.  You have to have a clear line of sight to one of their towers, though.  On the phone, they said they thought I could get signal, so I scheduled for them to come out and check.  I told them to be *sure* to call me, as I didn't live there and wanted to be present.

The day of the survey, they didn't call me.  When I called them, they told me nope, no signal, but that they could build a 50-foot-tall mast to get the receiver high enough to maybe get a signal.  I told them I don't give a shit, I need internet.  It was going to cost me $500.  They didn't have any masts though, and I had to wait for one to come in before they could test it.  So I put that on hold and called AT&amp;T, who of course had no idea who I was or that I had scheduled a test so I set it up again to happen in two days.

In the meantime, I found a competitor to Internet America named Rock Solid.  They were quite optimistic.  I scheduled them to come out and check, and they were able to send someone the next day!  Internet America scheduled a week out.  That day, I went to the house to see if they had come by yet and met the owner of the house.  He told me that the Internet America guy had come to the property, but didn't even get out of his freaking truck.  I wasn't sure whether to believe the guy or not.  Rock Solid didn't call me either, but they said they got a signal!  *And* they were cheaper, and I needed only a 10 foot pole on my roof, $20 instead of the $500 mast.  I called the realtor, gave the go-ahead, and got the house, forgetting about AT&amp;T and Internet America.  (By the way, IA apparently tried to call me on the day they went to try the mast, and since they didn't get a hold of me, they didn't even try.  WTF?  I called them and angrily told them to forget about me.)

OK, so I'm moving in.  Rock Solid's contractor comes out and says, ""Did you have a survey?""  Yep, we're good to go, I said.  They had no record, apparently.  But they DID tell me it was good signal with 10 ft pole. So, he puts up a ten foot pole, and no signal at ALL.  EXCEPT, he can see Internet America's freaking signal clear as day (73db).  What the hell.  As he's leaving, he tells me the paperwork has been filed for a new Rock Solid tower to be put up close to my house, and he's personally going to do it, and that he will give me a call when it's done (1 month).  In the mean time, I have to find internet for a month.  So I call AT&amp;T back.

Of course, again, they have no idea who I am, or that I had asked for that test that they were supposed to call me back about.  But this time, they said, sure, we can get you DSL!  Great!  (Not really that easy, there were a few more promised calls back that didn't happen.)  So, on X day, I waited from 8AM to 8PM for a guy to come out and install it.  Nobody comes.  The next morning, I call, they have no idea why, but promise to send someone out that day.  Nobody comes.  The next morning, I pick up the phone to call, and AT&amp;T calls me!  Someone is going to be there in 20 minutes!  He installs everything and it doesn't work.  (By the way, this was a long job--my house is 300 feet from the street, and he had to bury a cable from my house to the street).  He looks at his paperwork, and turns out they are going to turn on the internet *tomorrow*.  OK, fine.  

The next morning I am woken up by a call from AT&amp;T.  ""We've determined that your house cannot have DSL, so we've canceled your order.""  

Freaking great.  All I have is my Google CR-48 and a month to wait to hopefully MAYBE get internet from one of two lying-ass ISPs reselling service from another lying, evil, incompetent ISP.  There's no Clear, no Sprint, no T-Mobile data, probably no AT&amp;T data, and only Verizon with crappy signal for $80/mo on a two-year contract to get 10gb a month, and I'm a student as well who would occasionally like to refer to websites when writing papers....

I can't believe you read all that.  Thank you, both of you.

*Oh, I forgot to mention that just before this started I signed up for my free one-month trial of Hulu Plus.  So that's going to be gone, as well.

tl:dr: all ISP's suck and the US has third-world internet connectivity.

We're a little company that has been working on what we think is a pretty cool idea and we're looking for some feedback from the cord cutting community.  

We've written a bit of software which once installed on your computer, allows you to control  applications on your PC / Mac with your phone or tablet. As you interact with the computer the interface on your phone changes automatically to provide you controls for the software you are using or the website you are viewing.

We currently have remotes for Windows Media Center, XBMC, Media Portal, Plex, Photoshop, iTunes, VLC and a boat load of websites including Netflix, Vimeo, YouTube, Facebook and TED.

We call it Apptui and you can download it here:

[beta.apptui.com](https://beta.apptui.com/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=reddit+cordcutters)

How it works:

1. Download and install Apptui
2. Launch Apptui (find and click on the A that has been added to your task bar / menu bar and select Pair a Device)
3. Connect your phone or tablet to your computer by browsing to apptui.com, in your phone's browser, and entering in the screen code which appears in the Apptui window that appeared on your computer.
4. Launch your favourite media centre software and your phone will turn into a remote for that piece of software.   As you switch between applications the remote changes right along with you.

We would really appreciate people trying it out and giving us some feedback. The software isn't perfect but we're excited to hear what you guys think.

Thanks,

The Apptui Team

Because of this, I can't use Dropbox as I would have to pay for a premium account, which is what I don't really want as upload speeds in Australia are terrible, so syncing everything would always take a long time.

Because of this, I was wondering if there was anything you guys knew that can do the job for me? I've heard of and tried sea file - which is fine, but it works off git, so there aren't actual copies of the files on both machines. Having something very similar to dropbox would mean that I would be able to put the photos directly onto my desktop, and have them sync to the server where they could displayed on a slideshow, or stored on the server.

I posted a while ago when [Maraschino](http://www.maraschinoproject.com/) was in its infancy. It a web-based front-end for your XBMC HTPC, that acts as a dashboard to view and control XBMC, Sickbeard, SABnzdb, and many more.

Recently we have added support for multiple servers, so now you can easily switch to the XBMC installation in the bedroom and control that.

Another small change (that I feel is actually pretty useful) is the ability to choose from a 3, 4, or 5 column layout, which means that you can display a lot more modules on the screen.

We have quite an active dev community. Gugahoi has created a fully-functional module to manage Sickbeard, and NEM3SIS has create an advanced Trakt.tv module.

Other features include a media library browser and advanced playback/seek controls. You can even toggle ""remote"" mode and use your keyboard to control XBMC!

And of course, it shows you what has been recently added to your library, and looks kinda pretty too.

Sorry for the shameless self-promotion, just wanted to tell you guys how far along it has come (if you remember it the first time). Plus I want to grow the userbase... I want it to be the best XBMC-focussed web frontend that there is! Your suggestions would be welcome.

1295632806.0,55,self.cordcutters,f6li4,Glad to see this subreddit - thought I'd offer what sites work for me (most of the time),SoCalWingFan,56,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/f6li4/glad_to_see_this_subreddit_thought_id_offer_what/,"I subscribe to Netflix and usually use it on my PS3 or Wii, but let's be honest, there's an awful lot out there that isn't on demand with Netflix and probably won't be in the foreseeable future.  I hardly bother with Hulu, because I'm not paying for 2 streaming services, especially when one still gives me commercials, the content for the PS3 Hulu app is even  worse, yada yada yada.

I'm a big sports fan, and so one of my primary concerns was retaining the ability to watch live sports.  I bought an over the air HD antenna which actually gives a clearer, sharper, image than my ATT Uverse did, and that's great for any major sporting events that are on ABC, CBS, NBC, or FOX.  

For other sporting events I generally use one of the following links:
ATDHE - http://www.atdhe.net/watchtv.html
MYP2P - http://www.myp2p.eu/
Channel Surfing - http://www.channelsurfing.net/

These sites usually link to a JustinTv or similar site.  I use them frequently for watching Red Wings games, and I rarely need to miss a game. 

Another tip for hockey fans - Yahoo Sports has a ""Hockey Game of the Night"" either every day or nearly every day that you can watch for free.  If you check the MYP2P site, it will usually ID the Yahoo Game of the Night as such, but apparently you need a US IP Address to access these games.  

I don't stream many movies - usually Netflix or Redbox works find for me, but for TV shows, I've used the following sites:

TV Blinx - http://tv.blinkx.com/
Cast Tv - http://www.casttv.com/

Cast Tv is ok, but a lot of the shows are linked to Amazon or Itunes pay sites.  I've found that a lot of the links end up at Mega Video, which restricts your viewing time per day unless you subscribe with a paid account.  If you're using Google Chrome, you can install an extension called llimitux, which works in connection with Cacaoweb to remove such limitations from streaming sites.  This is very helpful if you're doing something like watching a full season of Rescue Me over the period of a couple days.  

In addition to all of the above sites, I'll go to the network sites for some content as well.  For Supernatural fans, the CW website has full episodes online.  TBS has Conan, etc...

To put it all together, I have an older laptop that has a HDMI out (at the time I got it, my friends asked, what are you gonna use that for?), and then I downloaded a wireless mouse/remote app for my Moto Droid and I can use that like a remote.  

I was pretty skeptical that I could be happy without cable, but saving over $70 a month is nice, and more than makes up for the admitted loss of quality when streaming most stuff (Netflix excluded).  I'm able to watch more sporting events than I did before and not worry about regional limitations, and it's nice to know that wherever I may go I have access to the same content via my laptop.  

I hope this helps anyone looking into cutting their cable, and hopefully this isn't a bunch of crap that everyone here already knows about.

Seeing as they have been charging $77 a month, it didn't really seem like enough of a discount. 

I got an Xbox Gold account last week (I'm not even sure that's the right name). I also signed up for a Netflix account at the same time. We have two daughters, four and seven years old, and they are loving the child programming. My wife has been watching other offerings. 

I haven't watched anything and really don't see myself needing it. All I ever watched was the news (News Hour, Meet the Press, etc.) and I can get all of that online.

This may interest you.,db2,58,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/plvti/got_a_samsung_device_tvbd_without_builtin/,"Update: I've been using it for about 5 days and the AE1000 unfortunately is not entirely stable. It works but drops the connection occasionally for no apparent reason. For streaming it's an annoyance, but if you were to use it for a firmware update it could conceivably brick your device. At this point due to that I don't recommend anyone use the AE1000 in this way.

I think the AE1000 is just a shit adapter, many others have had problems using it on their computer in its intended fashion.

I'm leaving this up so others can use the information it contains in other applications, such as changing the ID on a better adapter.

-----

*note: you will need linux for this*

I've got a Sammy BD player, ""wireless ready"" which is marketing-speak for ""it doesn't have wireless"". It's a nice player, plays most anything I throw at it (unless it's via DLNA but that's another post) plus internet things like Netflix and such.

I'd been looking at getting a wireless stick for it. First I located the officially-supported one, [WIS09ABGN](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-WIS09ABGN-LinkStick-Wireless-Adapter/dp/B0021LA1BE) - but $80 seemed a little steep for that. So I Googled a lot and found out that several other devices work including the [Rosewill RNX-N1](http://www.amazon.com/Rosewill-RNX-N1-Wireless-N-Dongle-02-11b/dp/B003W22MOU). I'd been deciding whether to order one of those when it occurred to me that I should at least look over what I have already to see if anything might work. I was in luck.

As it turns out the Sammy official stick is just like any other RaLink-based stick. There is nothing special about it beyond Samsung being able to control the hardware and thus make tech support simpler. (which reminds me - if you do this Samsung won't help you with networking problems if you tell them it's not a Samsung adapter)

I had purchased a [Linksys AE1000](http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-Linksys-AE1000-High-Performance-Wireless-N-Adapter/dp/B003B20F5E) a while ago, intending to use it with my computer. That didn't work out so hot so it got shoved in to the back of a drawer until tonight. As part of that attempt I had compiled the proper driver also, Google can help you do that yourself, it is beyond the scope of this post. It turns out that the chipset used in the AE1000 is among those Samsung devices will recognize and use.

First I tried just plugging it in, sometimes that works. Apparently that Rosewill stick I mentioned earlier is like that. No such luck with the AE1000 though, the Sammy didn't even see it. So I decided to do some magic.

Following the idea [here](http://wiki.samygo.tv/index.php5/Using_NoN-Samsung_USB_WiFi_dongles_with_TV) I plugged the AE1000 in to my computer and issued the following commands once `lsusb` indicated it was ready:

    iwpriv ra0 e2p 208=04E8
    iwpriv ra0 e2p 20A=2018

What that does is write new USB ID information on to the AE1000, effectively making it look like the WIS09ABGN. After doing it unplug it and plug it back in to your computer and do 'lsusb' again, you should see it identified as the Sammy stick instead now.

After doing that I plugged it in to the back of the player, after going to setup to set it up it works wonderfully. I can now take down one of the wires I have draped across the room. ;)

**Note:** You can't just do this to any USB wireless dongle you have, it must have the right chipset in it. Doing it to the wrong type would at best not work, at worst damage the adapter or tv/bd device.

*As of this post the Rosewill adapter is cheaper than the AE1000. The Rosewill is only 2.4Ghz whereas the AE1000 is dual band. The Rosewill will be compatible out-of-the-box though. Either way both are half the price or less than the Sammy official adapter so do what works best for you.*

*Also, if your AE1000 uses a non-RaLink chipset it won't work for this. I think they're all the same but just in case you know to check to be sure.*

----

*If anyone does this and wants to undo the changed IDs these are the commands to put the AE1000 back to how it was before:*

1337055625.0,48,self.cordcutters,tnokm,How I tricked the NBA into letting me watch local games on my AppleTV. ,Wayne_Skylar,65,17,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/tnokm/how_i_tricked_the_nba_into_letting_me_watch_local/,"So my setup is basically using a jailbroken AppleTV with XBMC. Works pretty well, IMO, although there are probably better setups. 

Anyway I purchased Leauge Pass without fully understanding the blackout rules. I figured it'd be similar to the NFL since I've not been an NBA fan for long. I got it with the intention of watching my local team but was super disappointed when I realized that I couldn't do that. Being a software developer I figured there was a way around it.  

I waited until now to divulge my secret because I didn't want anyone else doing it! And since League Pass is so shit, I doubt I'll even bother next year.  So now I'll divulge my secret. 

The basic principle is to use a proxy server. Now a lot of proxy servers require configuration of the device you'd like to use it with. The AppleTV doesn't have such a configuration, so I decided to go with something called a transparent proxy. You configure your router to forward all traffic from a given IP address on your local network to the proxy. This works because the proxy is often in a different area than your local IP address. Since League Pass uses IP address geolocation to determine if you can see a game or not, this effectively sidesteps it. So I was able to watch games that weren't on national TV. 

Most of the steps I took were on the site here:

http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Squid_Transparent_Proxy

So the first step is to get a router that you can install DD-WRT on. I used amazon ec2 for my proxy host. Once you get the EC2 image set up you simply fire it up, modify your local router IPtables setting and then you're good to go! 

Once you get your proxy up and running simply log in to your router and issue the following commands (from the above link)


    #!/bin/sh
    PROXY_IP=192.168.1.10
    PROXY_PORT=3128
    LAN_IP=`nvram get lan_ipaddr`
    LAN_NET=$LAN_IP/`nvram get lan_netmask`
    
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br0 -s $LAN_NET -d $LAN_NET -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br0 -s ! $PROXY_IP -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to $PROXY_IP:$PROXY_PORT
    iptables -t nat -I POSTROUTING -o br0 -s $LAN_NET -d $PROXY_IP -p tcp -j SNAT --to $LAN_IP
    iptables -I FORWARD -i br0 -o br0 -s $LAN_NET -d $PROXY_IP -p tcp --dport $PROXY_PORT -j ACCEPT

Now this is designed for a proxy on the local network, but you can actually use the public IP of your proxy box and everything will work just fine! This does forward all traffic to your proxy so it's advisable to reset your router (removing the forwarding rules) after you're done watching. I used a t1.micro instance and it worked fine. 

Anyway I realize the above information might be a bit sparse / difficult to understand, but I figured I'd post it here to show how it's possible. 

One potential problem though. I'm not entirely sure how the NBA determines the IP address. The amazon ec2 machine is located in Virginia and you can control this based on which zone you boot the image in. But sometimes I felt like it was using Washington State as the location (where amazon is actually located). So I never bothered to figure that out since it was never an issue. 

I realize this is a nice thing and probably not helpful to the majority of folks here, but figured I'd lay out my process here to help out whoever might find it useful.",,False,,t5_2sa6y,False,,,True,t3_tnokm,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/tnokm/how_i_tricked_the_nba_into_letting_me_watch_local/,

according to my [modified tvfool](http://imgur.com/NzbYiDr) my stations are ~ 70miles away. Most of the stations at 58^o are UHF while most of the stations at 210-260^o are VHF. 

Stations that are not blacked out are the ones that I am able to consistently get.

--------------------------------------------------------------

**The Solution:**

1. Attic Install of DIY mclapp antenna + DIY clearstream 5 antenna w/ reflectors

2. careful tuning of the antennas. changes in the direction of the anntenna and the distance of reflectors from the antenna can make a big difference in signal strength. 

3. Original Channel Master 7777 pre-amp

4. RF/coax splitter to feed antenna signal to each wall outlet in entire house. Signal feeds over a dozen outlets which includes 6 tvs

total cost ~ $100 US

I've had a lot of friends ask about it since it works well and was super affordable. This can be done to fit any budget and will last for years.

**The Box:**

To start things off, this isn't actually a build. Its a Dell Optiplex 745 tower that can be found just about anywhere for under $100 with a reasonable amount of RAM. I just picked up another yesterday (11/30/12) for $60 on eBay. The current one I have running cost me $80 on craigslist.

[Dell Optiplex 745](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=Dell+Optiplex+745+Core+2+Duo&amp;_sacat=171957&amp;_odkw=Dell+Optiplex+745&amp;_osacat=171957&amp;_from=R40)

**This model comes in a few form factors:**

[Small Form Factor](http://www.itinstock.com/ekmps/shops/itinstock/images/dell-optiplex-745-dt-intel-core-2-duo-dual-core-desktop-pc-2.13ghz-80gb-2gb-5136-p.jpg)

[Tower](http://hot100tips.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Dell-Optiplex-745-Tower-Core-2-Duo.jpg)

**By now you're probably asking, why a Dell and why this one?**

They're really cheap and really easy to find parts for thanks to corporate and public sector refresh cycles and share the same components with the same year Apple iMac. (More on that later)

**OK, whatever. Let's see some specs:**

Processor: 1.8 or 2.13 Core 2 Duo

RAM: Supports up to 8GB of DDR2 (also cheap and easy to find)

Hard Drives: Comes most commonly with a crap 120 or 160GB Western Digital SATA (3Gb/s)


**OK, fine. Just stop the boring stuff. Why the hell would I want this?**

Beyond how cheap and common they are, this processor and RAM setup are perfect for storing media to stream to other devices. The SFF is a little on the large size while the tower is the size you'd expect with 4 drive bays. I see so many posts about building a $500 HTPC or Server that are complete overkill. Movies and Music whether on a hard drive or on the internet are not hard to stream. You don't need that much horsepower. You'll hit a bottleneck with your network bandwidth long before you'll exceed the streaming capabilities of this machine.

**What was that Apple mention earlier about?**

This box is 100% Hackintosh compatible including ethernet, the original videocard, the DVD writer, everything. The reason I bought another was because I'm going to have one running Windows and the other running OSX. The current machine dual boots into Mountain Lion and W7. The installation instructions can be found [here](http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/HCL_10.7.0/Desktops#Optiplex_745). Definitely not for the faint of heart as it took a few tries and a few hours to get it all fully working.

**What about the hard drive size?**

This is where the real cost comes in. I used the original drive it came with as the boot drive and partitioned it into seperate OSX/W7 volumes. Since the tower model has 4 drive bays, I ordered a few drives during the Black Friday sale from NewEgg for storage, hopefully you caught their sale as the 3TB Seagate's were going for $85. 

**So how does this become a HTPC again?**

You can find many videocards to answer that. I found a respectable 1GB HDMI/DVI out card for this for under $20 on Amazon. Again, more than enough horsepower to play or stream any media. This box stays in a closet while I ran long HDMI cable to my receiver. A bluetooth keyboard and mouse combo provides the input. 

**If you're thinking this isn't going to be fast enough, you're wrong.**

The majority of my movies are 1080p or Blu-Ray rips of 1-5GB each. I can stream multiple movies simultaneously without any buffering. Like I said earlier, you'll find a bottleneck on your network long before you reach your processing ceiling with this box.

**Well, it sounds like a good deal but what all do you actually use yours for?**

-Media Storage (obviously. I put 12 TBs in mine)

-Streaming Music or Movies to multiple devices using Plex

-Recording TV (HDHomerun is the shit)

-Backups (The Hackintosh machine for the Macs of the house, the W7 for the PCs)

**Most commonly used programs:**

-Plex for streaming to other devices in the house (Phones, Tablets, Media Streamers)

-XBMC for playback

-Windows Media Center (for recording or watching TV)

-EyeTV (watching/recording TV on OSX)


**Essentials**

-Dell Optiplex 745 - $60

-Videocard - $20 (If HTPC, not if used for storage)

**Optional Upgrades:**

-8GB of DDR2 - $60

-4x 3TB Seagate HD - $250

**Other Recommendations:**

-[HDHomerun](https://www.google.com/search?q=HDHomerun&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=HDHomerun&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57j0j5j0j62l2.2990&amp;sugexp=chrome,mod=0&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) - Found for $40 on eBay, $60-80 everywhere else





Hope this helps!


EDIT: Many comments about the total price. I wanted to show everyone a basic setup that can be found inexpensively and works for my needs. I fully believe this is more than capable for 90% of what many of you are looking for. In the end my setup may have come out to be a lot more than $100 when you factor in the amount of drives and space I put into mine. You don't need 8GB of RAM nor 12 TB.

1347149305.0,51,self.cordcutters,zkuwj,Fed up with ESPN's decision to take all the good games off of ESPN3? I just sent this letter to Cox and ESPN. Please feel free to copy and send to your ISP and ESPN to let them know how you feel.,lambcaseded,72,21,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/zkuwj/fed_up_with_espns_decision_to_take_all_the_good/,"Dear Cox Communications, 

I'm writing in regards to your inclusion of ESPN3 in your internet offerings. Recently, ESPN has made the decision to remove ""non-exclusive"" programming from its ESPN3 channel. This means that any games that are already being shown on ABC, ESPN or ESPN2 (i.e. most of the games worth watching) will no longer be shown on ESPN3. So, what remains on ESPN3 is an assortment of low-level NCAA football, cricket, lacrosse, Canadian football, volleyball, etc, etc. Basically, it's a channel full of stuff that no one except family members of the athletes playing in these games would want to watch.

So my question is: why would Cox Communications continue to pay ESPN so that its subscribers will have access to this channel? I can tell you, as a big sports fan, that there is now NO reason to have this channel. I would hope that ESPN would either reconsider its decision to stop airing prime games on ESPN3, or that Cox would stop paying (and charging its customers) for access to this channel.

On your website you advertise ESPN3 as ""ESPN3 NOW MEANS EVEN MORE TO SPORTS."" This statement couldn't be further from the truth. ESPN3 has rendered itself useless... and I urge you to either pressure ESPN to return to putting quality programming on the channel, or stop paying for it, and stop charging your customers for it.

I have Googled frequently for some solutions but any website I find that does streams or will load random Hulu/Netflix videos goes down.

Any suggestions appreciated thanks.

**EDIT:** So PseudoTV + XMBC works really well I just don't have a very large downloaded library of shows but I'll now be working on that.  You can apparently add Hulu and Netflix to your XMBC library with some extensions though (which would make it work with PseudoTV I think) so I'll be trying that soon.

I also just found out that if I plug my TV into the cable outlet I can actually pick up a decent amount of channels including some HD ones.  I don't pay for cable but I do pay for cable internet so I guess there's some signals that they're unable to turn off that I'm getting.

* You can't watch some HD content on your PC, they lock it to other devices. [here is an example](http://imgur.com/d1X1rLJ)

* Both of their streaming plugins (flash and silverlight) are piss-poor: Youtube HD, Netflix HD and 1080 mkv work perfectly on the same system. Their plug-in grinds to a halt and chops regularly unless you are watching on iPad or Kindle (the perfect home theatre setup I guess?)

* Their own player crashing somehow maxes out your 2 device limit for a good 5-10 minutes sometimes.

* Their service is ""down"" or at least reported to be by the plugin rather frequently. (I have a hard wired connection, Comcast high-speed, not the basic 1.6 Mbit)

* Their interface is designed to trick your kids into spending your money. There isn't a just for kids dashboard (on set-top implementations). 

* As far as their app is concerned: Kindle -&gt; you're good, iPad -&gt; you're good, any other Android -&gt; nope

*I should also add that I use Chrome and Firefox, and assume that since Youtube and Netflix have no issues on my system, that I shouldn't have to bend over backwards to get Amazon's plug-in working better either.*

I find myself swearing nightly as I swap our HTPC out and plug our old BluRay player in just for the stability of the embedded Amazon client. Is this the future?

In any case, I expected a lot better from Amazon given their track record. Their Instant Video service wreaks of poor design and lack of support from Amazon themselves... I get the feeling they really don't care about the quality of it. Perhaps because it's tagged on to Prime shipping?

I could care less about continuing to use the service I just think its sad for a company like Amazon to provide such a poor product. In addition most of my searches show similar complaints and gripes that have gone unaddressed for about as long as the service has been around.

As a fairly recent convert to CordCutting myself, I noticed that many people have the same question I did starting out, ""what OTA antenna do I buy?""  Like many technical questions, the answer is ""it depends"".   For someone new to CordCutting, this can be frustrating as hell.  I know, I've been there.  This guide is intended to help get you started down the right path.  What this guide won't do is tell you which antenna to buy; it can't because, it depends. But, it might get you closer.

One of the first places you will be sent to answer this question should be the TVFool Signal Analysis page.  It is overwhelming at first; but, full of useful information to get you going.  This guide should help you get a report and read some of the most pertinent information on that report to get you started.

**Getting a Signal Analysis Report:**

1. Open http://tvfool.com in your favorite browser
2. On the left hand side, click the **TV Signal Locator** button
3. Enter your address in the fields provided
4. Enter a reasonable height for your antenna.  If you have no idea, try 25 feet.
5. Click the **Find Local Channels** button

After a few seconds, you should get something which looks fairly similar to [this page](http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=29&amp;q=id%3d1ddaec1b950312)

**Reading the report:**

The information on this page really is useful, I promise, it's just so dense that it might as well be lead shielded.  We'll start at the top left and work our way down

1. First and foremost, skip down until you see a circle with a bunch of colors and lines, everything above that is not useful to you today.
2. Now, skip over to your right to the table with the headings: **==Channel==**, **====Signal====**, **Dist**, and **==Azimuth==**
3. This is where you need to locate the channels you want to get.  For most of us, if asked, we want ""ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox"" and maybe a few more.  If you look at the **Netwk** column this is where you are going to find those network names.
4. What you need to do is find copies of each of those networks with a similar **Azimuth** (**True** or **Magn** doesn't matter for now, just pick one and stick with it. I used **Magn** as magnetic is much more useful down the road).  You also want to pick stations near the top of the chart.  Take note of the **Callsign**, **Real** and **Virt** for each station you choose, you'll need these later.  

For example, in the report I [linked](http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=29&amp;q=id%3d1ddaec1b950312) I found:  
WJLA-TV - 7 - 7.1 - ABC - 35°  
WUSA - 9 - (empty) - CBS - 35°  
WRC-DT - 48 - 4.1 - NBC - 35°  
WTTG - 36 - 5.1 - FOX - 35°  

I'm lucky, all of my stations are pretty close together, this isn't always the case.  But, +/- 5° will probably be OK.  

**UHF,VHF and you**

Let's get technical.  In the US, Over the Air (OTA) TV stations ""went digital"" a few years ago.  When this happened, some stations were forced into the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) range of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Some were allowed to stay in the Very High Frequency (VHF) range of the electromagnetic spectrum.  VHF is further broken down as 'Lo' and 'Hi'.  

What does this mean to you?  Well, depending on which stations you want to get, you may need an entirely different antenna; or, even two antennas.  This is what the TVFool report is telling you, albeit in a very obtuse way.

If you scroll down below the table of stations you should see two boxes, a small one with **VHF Lo** and **VHF Hi** on the top and one with **UHF** on the top.  These boxes let you know where stations lie in the electromagnetic spectrum.  In between is a column labeled **dBm**, we'll ignore him for the moment; but, notice the word **Channel** at the bottom, we do care about that line.

What you want to look for here is the **Callsigns** of the stations you picked out above.  If you picked stations near the top of the list, you should see them higher up (vertically) in the box.  Also, if you look at the bottom of the boxes, you will see the **Channel** numbers, these are the **Real** channel number you noted above. 

What you are looking for here is which box each station lies in.

For my [example](http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=29&amp;q=id%3d1ddaec1b950312):

WJLA-TV - 7 - 7.1 - ABC - 35° - **VHF-Hi**  
WUSA - 9 - (empty) - CBS - 35° - **VHF-Hi**  
WRC-DT - 48 - 4.1 - NBC - 35° - **UHF**  
WTTG - 36 - 5.1 - FOX - 35° - **UHF**  

So, I have two channels each in the VHF-Hi and UHF spectrum.  What this means is that I need an antenna which not only performs well in the UHF spectrum (which is what many antennas will advertise against); but, I also need an antenna with good VHF performance.  This can be tough to get in a single package.  

**Loopy Rabbit Ears and Bowties in Bays**

""So, Sylver_Dragon"" you ask, ""now that I have read this massive wall of text, what antenna do I need?""  Well, now we get into that ""it depends"" area again.  
First off, back on that [TVFool Signal Analysis](http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&amp;Itemid=29&amp;q=id%3d1ddaec1b950312) from earlier, look in the **Path** column for your picked stations.  This will be either **LOS**, **1Edge**, **2Edge**, or **Tropo**.  In my example, all of mine are **1Edge**  
What do these mean?   

* **LOS** - Line of sight - Basically, the transmitting tower is pretty close and would probably be visible if there weren't any trees.  You should have a pretty easy time of it and don't need much in the way of an antenna.  
* **1Edge** - Single Edge Diffraction - Short version: the tower is far enough out that you wouldn't see it even if the Earth was perfectly smooth, you're getting signals which bend around the planet.  
* **2Edge** - Double Edge Diffraction - So, those **1Edge** signals bending around the Earth, those are still going over your head; but, thanks to the way EM Radiation works, you get a second (far less powerful) shot.  By this point, you're going to have a tough time pulling a signal in.  But, it should still be possible.  
* **Tropo** - If you're trying to pull in one of these signals, you're going to have a bad time.

Antenna types:  
* [Rabbit ears](http://imgur.com/NoIPyUI) tend to be for very close, strong **VHF** signals.  They usually sit next to, or on top of, your TV.  If all of your stations have a path of **LOS** and are **VHF** you might do OK with this type.  They are cheap, easy to setup; but, are really the least effective of all.  
* [Loop antennas](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/01/Loop_antenna.jpg/200px-Loop_antenna.jpg) are exactly what you'd imagine, a big loop.   They are good for **UHF** signals and so-so for **VHF** signals.  They come in a variety sizes and you might see some antennas where several loops are linked together for a better signal.  
* [Loop/Rabbit Ear combos](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Rabbit-ears_dipole_antenna_with_UHF_loop_20090204.jpg) So, some enterprising bastard said, ""hey, what if I put a loop antenna and rabbit ears together?""  And this is what you get.   It's going to do a mediocre job of picking up both **VHF** and **UHF** signals; but, probably only those with an **LOS** path.  
* [Bowties](http://i.imgur.com/Bxtal.jpg) are cool!  Bowties are sort of the jack-of-all trades, they will do an OK job with **VHF** and **UHF** and can be tuned a touch by the length of their ""whiskers"" (the metally bits sticking out to the sides).  
* [Yagi](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Two_meter_yagi.jpg) antennas are highly specialized antennas for pulling in specific signals.  If you are desperate to cut the cord and so far out you are dealing with **Tropo** signals, you might end up with one of these.  Honestly though, if you've hit this level, you need to do far more research than my writeup will provide.  Let's just pretend the word **Yagi** never came up, and we'll all be happier.   

Beyond these basic types, you will see antennas where the manufacturer either combined several types and/or tied a bunch of the same type together.  Each element is called a **Bay**.  For example, [this antenna](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Antennas-Direct---ClearStream-4-Outdoor-Long-Range-Digital-TV-Antenna/9151687.p?id=1218037434269&amp;skuId=9151687) is a 4 Bay Loop antenna (notice the 4 black circles).  As you might have guessed, more **Bays** mean a better signal, usually.  In fact, I have that exact antenna picking up **UHF** stations for me at that **1Edge** path.  

The other thing to take notice of is a **Reflector**.  Engineers being almost universally unimaginative when it comes to naming things, a **Reflector** sits behind your antenna and reflects signals back at the antenna to provide for a better overall signal.  Again, thanks to the way EM radiation works, an antenna reflector often looks like a wire mesh which couldn't catch a cold.  It can, however, catch and reflect UHF and VHF signals.  Often times, a reflector can be the difference between no signal at all and a good signal.

**Knowing is half the battle**  

If you'll recall, at the very top of this guide I said, ""What this guide won't do is tell you which antenna to buy"".  That really is my story and I'm sticking to it.  Hopefully though, you have a good bit more information to help you make an informed choice.  Now, if you're ready to run out and get buying, I'd like to offer one more possible option for you:  Build it yourself.  

When I got started, I ran out and bought that ClearStream antenna I linked earlier, and you know what?  It didn't do it for me.  It pulls in my **UHF** channels beautifully, and pulls in exactly dick for VHF channels.  I don't blame ClearStream or BestBuy (not much anyway).  I blame myself for assuming that the advertised ""Up to 65-mile range"" was all I needed to care about.  It wasn't.  After mucking about in my attic trying to get something on the **VHF** side, I spent the time to learn about everything I have just spewed at you in this post.  Then, I grabbed some scrap I had laying around a [built](http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/15v084/diy_antenna_with_reflector/) my own bowtie antenna and reflector.  It's really not that hard to do, and the measurements are very forgiving.  Seriously, if you have some basic tools, give it a shot, you won't be out all that much money if it doesn't work; and, it can save you a ton if it does.

I hope you've enjoyed this guide, please fell free to ask any questions as I enjoy the sound of my own voice.

I'm a lurker of this subreddit but thought I'd finally let you know how I cut the cord in my house.  I did a search and didn't see ONE entry concerning [Vortexbox](http://vortexbox.org/content/) which is what I use to cut the cord.

In the past I've had a Boxee Box, Mac Mini HTPC with Plex, and now I'm set with my Vortexbox!  It's perfect.

Vortexbox is a fork of Fedora 16.  Out of the box it has some of the following features:


* CIFS shares immediately available after install.
* Squeezebox server for Logitech Media Devices
* Automatically rips DVDs and CD's to the harddrive
* DLNA server
* PLEX Media Server (separate, push to install)
* Subsonic
* Bliss
* Web GUI and Webmin for configuration

More info here: [http://info.vortexbox.org/](http://info.vortexbox.org/)


You can download Vortexbox as an ISO and install it on any spare machine you may have lying around.  You will only need a pretty decent system if you plan on streaming video with Plex that needs to be transcribed on the fly (Plex DOES NOT offload to GPU).

I have a Quad Core AMD throw together with 8GB RAM and a 2TB HDD.  The server is up and running and sits in the corner of my computer room with just a power cable and CAT5 cable.  My house is wired for Ethernet and is 1GB.

I have two [ROKU 2 XS's](http://www.roku.com/roku-products#3) in my house.  There is a Plex app available.  I stream all my movies and TV shows with Plex without a hitch at 720P.  Plex will do 1080P if you want it to.  

Plex also has a sharing feature that lets your family and friends share your media over the net should you have sufficient bandwidth to do so.

I hope to get Vortexbox some more traffic.  It's a great system and the dev and others are very responsive on the forums.  If you want anymore information feel free to ask.  I'll monitor this thread for a few hours if anyone has questions.

I knew they did, but not the HD signal. I tried it a few months ago and all i got were SD channels and the basic major networks. SOOO..long story short... I was going through all the steps in buying an antenna and when looking at the wiring I already had I found a splitter and tried connecting the tv to see if any channels would pop up. I left the scanner running and actually went to get food. When I came back and checked the channels to my amazement I had a TON of new channels. Not only was i getting them in HD i got some that i thought were cable only like my local News station.  So I said let me take advantage of this while i can and went
to microcenter and bought a hdhomerun as I already have boxees and HTPC's around the house, i dont' need to run coax cable everywhere which i was planning to do with the antenna. 

Well, to my surprise the HDhomerun works awesome with everything. 
Not only does it work well, it even does sourround sound in 5.1 on my home theater. I did not expect that! The quality is pretty damn good too, it's not as good as straight coax, but it's close and that's fine. 

It works well in XBMC, I gotta figuire out if i can do some sort of guide
and channel changing w/ pvr functions if possible but as of right now
it's just a file for each channel and i select what i want to watch. Same goes for the boxee, i have a file for each channel and it streams it live. It actually works decent on the boxee, with a few seconds of buffering (1-2) and the picture is great! Best part I don't have to run coax! Again, you don't have the option to channel change like a normal tv but honestly it's more for just turning on the news or something.

Netflix and Hulu Plus do have a nice selection.  I'll be honest they don't have everything but they do have enough to keep me entertained.  The only thing i'm gonna miss are the HBO/Showtime shows like Game of Thrones and Nurse Jackie but thankfully my parents have the Comcast Triple Play Premiere and get every channel so I use their account when I want to watch something.  I can also always add the dvd/bluray plan to my netflix later on.

I'm only a few days into doing this and it does feel weird with CNN not on in the background but i've realized something.  CNN on TV is just repeating news stories over and over with commercials baked in.  In 5 minutes I can go to cnn.com and read the latest news and be caught up.  And then of course FAcebook and Twitter where I seem to get the latest up to minute news these days.

I'm happy with my choice so far.  I feel liberated in the sense that i've gained time back in my life.  I haven't lost entertainment options, I can still stream so much awesome content.  But I have gained the freedom to not be glued to the tv.

1360433131.0,44,self.cordcutters,1879ea,PSA for those considering cutting phone cord: Please consider your emergency services!,sm4k,101,57,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/1879ea/psa_for_those_considering_cutting_phone_cord/,"I've seen a couple of threads where people talk about cutting the phone along with cable TV and just using a cell phone or Google Voice for your calling needs. The problem is that 911  sucks on these services, and I'd hate for someone to get hurt because they didn't consider that from the get-go.

(I'm in the USA so, this may not be accurate where you live.)

When you call 911 on a cell phone, you usually get dumped to the nearest metropolitan dispatch, who then routes you around to the proper city once they've figured out where you are. Depending on the emergency, you may or may not be OK with the time it takes for this to happen.

I use Google voice, but only for call routing. I can't speak with any authority as to how effective their 911 or E911 services are, but [this thread dated May of last year](https://productforums.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/voice/ENBJxkdrVJE) suggests that Google Voice doesn't support E911 at all. Most of the guides out there on how to make E911 work with Google Voice involve bringing in a VOIP provider anyway.

If you're going to cut your phone line, **PLEASE** take the time to investigate the impact on your emergency services. It doesn't have to impact them at all if you consider them from the start.

I use [Call Centric](http://www.callcentric.com/), and for very small fee I have E911, so that if I ever have to call 911, it immediately puts me in the correct dispatch, and my home address is fed to them without me even having to say anything. This was huge in getting the wife's buy-in for dumping the traditional phone service.

I have friends that love their [Ooma](http://www.ooma.com/), which I believe is basically just a one-time cost VOIP service. I know they support E911.

Quite a few people in r/cordcutters seem to think highly of [OBIHAI](http://www.obihai.com/). I'm not familiar with an OBIHAI, but it appears to simply be an ATA that natively supports Google Voice. I hope someone will chime in the comments with their experience with the service, and how well the emergency services work.

You may be able to use OBIHAI with any VOIP provider, but in case you find a provider that doesn't support it, a likely equivalent device would be a [Cisco SPA112](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833150140) that is usable on just about any serious VOIP service provider.

As far as my cost goes, here's a breakdown I made for a friend about a month ago, from September to January 1:

* Total cost to date: $32.27 (does not include the cost of the phones or the ATA)
* Total costs of Account Fees only: $22.18
* Average Monthly cost: $8.07
* Average Calls per month: 35
* Average Call Length: 4:21
* Average cost per minute (including all account fees): $.06

It's worth mentioning that in September we had the initial set up fees, making that month $8 more expensive than the rest. For October - December only, our average monthly cost is only $6.01.

These costs include a fee to have a local number instead of the free 777 area code number that Call Centric provided, and $1.50/month for E911 services.

Whichever route you go, once you think you're good, **TEST YOUR 911.** Just call and explain that you don't have an emergency, you were just testing your 911 services and wanted to make sure your information came through properly. When I did this, the dispatcher was more than helpful, and read my name and address back and even thanked me for testing it.

**TL,DR: If you're cutting your phone code, PLEASE consider the emergency services ramifications in your solution, and test it when you're done!**",,False,,t5_2sa6y,False,,,True,t3_1879ea,http://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/1879ea/psa_for_those_considering_cutting_phone_cord/,

When I original signed up with Verizon FIOS I was told to get the land line in the bundle because it would bring down the price. Which it did but I was ending up paying more for a phone I never used than for my 15mbps internet connection.

After out 2yrs was up I asked if they had packages with out land lines. This took some talking to get them to give me a TV\Internet only package, they have them they just try and keep you on a land line. (I still haven't cut TV yet.) After getting rid of that I saved about $30 a month, the problem is we didn't have a land line any more and it was tough to not have that in case a cell phone was off or had a dead battery. Eventually after having to give out a number more and more I decided to look for another option instead of always giving out the cell number.

This is when I found out about SIP and the [Obi device](http://www.amazon.com/OBi110-Service-Bridge-Telephone-Adapter/dp/B0045RMEPI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1342452566&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=obi).

All you need is a free Google Voice account, a network connection and an Obi. There might be others out there but that's what I have been using. (I do not work for Obihai in any shape or form I just thought this would be a nice way for people to save some money.)

For about 6 months now I have been running an Obi plus my Google voice account with no issues. I get my voice mail in emails which is great and I can manage anything I want from my gvoice account.

The only cost is of the Obi which is a lot cheaper than paying $30 a month of a little used land line. Setup of the device was very simple, I believe it required an email address and an account through the site but that was it. It took about 30 minutes to get up an running.

A couple things that may put some people off and not want to do something like this.
* The Obi does not automatically use 911, you can $1 a month I think to activate it. I haven't done this yet but I might at some point.
* Google Voice is currently free for the rest of 2012 for local and receiving calls. I don't know if this will change next year or not but just something to note.

I hope this might be useful for someone.

During the two months of no cable, my wife and I added Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime (mostly for free shipping benefit) to our new Roku 3.  It's not legit, but we also have family/friend logins for HBO GO and Netflix so we have those for free.

In addition, we were paying $3/week for the current Mad Men episodes.  When that breaks down, we added another $20 to that monthly expense making it $92/month.  In addition, I'm a big sports fan and more often than not, trying to watch a game was a pain.

My new ISP provider is offering a plan that would cost $123 for everything:  digital HD cable with DVR,  same internet plan, and taxes.

Would replacing the vertical coathangers with wire help improve things? What kind of wire should I get?

  As far as specifics, I live in Toronto, and can get most of the stations from the CN Tower, except for CFTO (DT 9). I can also get some Buffalo stations, except for FOX 29 (DT 14) and ch 49 (DT 49). I'm also missing CKVR from Barrie (DT 10), even though Barrie is closer than Buffalo.

Granted it is a rather expensive STB but if you already have a computer, you may find that you like using the computer from the couch better anyway and the living room is a good permanent place for it. Nothing beats reddit at 1080x1920. How many of you don't feel the need for any setup more special than hooking up the computer?
