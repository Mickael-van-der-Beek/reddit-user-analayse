Sorry for all the text.

While my brother was visited for the weekend he had left Facebook logged in. At some point my Grandpa must have gone on the computer, which may have been the only time he's ever done so.

Last week I called to let him and my Grandma know that I would be passing their town on the way to Niagara Falls and again on the way home. Grandma insisted that my ""roommate"" and I come for dinner. Grandpa got on the phone and told me that he had been worried that I worked so much, that I never brought a girl to family functions or talked about a girl.

Now the shocker, he said he was ""So glad to learn that [I]'d gotten engaged"" and that he was ""so proud"" of me and happy that I'd found somebody to spend my life with. Once my fianc√© and I showed up for dinner Grandpa was super friendly, calling him ""my boy"" and pulling out photo albums.",,False,self,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_1978t1,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1978t1/so_my_80_year_old_grandpa_found_out_im_gay_and/,

Ok here it goes:	",Feed_Me_No_Lies,981,180,252,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/191s2y/as_i_slide_into_my_late_thirties_id_like_to_say/,"These are hookup apps.  These are NOT tools to build relationships through. (Cue the posts from the couples who met on grindr and are ‚Äúhappily in love.‚Äù  I get it.  *Sometimes* it works, but that is not the main purpose of these things and they don‚Äôt foster long relationships as easily as other methods.)  As a 36 year old gay guy in an 11 year relationship, it pains me to see this amazing new generation of gay guys wasting so much of their time with these types of things and then wonder out loud ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I find someone quality?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy are people so mean on these things?‚Äù  

These apps and the internet in general are NOT the equivalent of meeting someone though a friend over coffee.  They are NOT the equivalent of dinner and a movie.  Most importantly, they are NOT the equivalent of getting off your ass and improving yourself as a person so that you *become* someone desirable.  (NOTE: I understand that sometimes the internet or these apps are literally the only way someone can met other gay people in their area.  That is a separate issue and it shouldn‚Äôt be confused with the general theme of the emotional recklessness that I‚Äôm talking about in this post.) 

If you are looking for ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationships and you know what someone‚Äôs asshole tastes like before you know their religion or their politics, your gonna have a bad time in general.  I don‚Äôt post this stuff to sound superior or to make myself feel like some wise old sage...I‚Äôm not at all and I‚Äôve made mistakes. But I‚Äôm posting this because there really seems to be a lot of confusion from many people about how to form ‚Äúreal‚Äù and lasting relationships as gay folks and it makes me sad to see so many people making the same mistake over and over.   

**We don‚Äôt get the relationship training our straight peers do.  We don‚Äôt get the family support our straight friends do.  We start out deficient in this area and I think it is the cause of a lot of our problems as a community.  Because we don‚Äôt get this external support, we have to take care of each other and that‚Äôs why I feel compelled to speak out.**

By the way, this isn‚Äôt necessarily a youth thing, even though I alluded to that above.  This website is geared towards youth, so that is what I see on here but I see a LOT of middle aged gay guys doing the same thing:  They are 40-50 and single and CONSTANTLY wonder why.  All you have to do is look at their narcissistic, shallow, sex-obsessed lives and instantly say ‚ÄúBingo.  There‚Äôs your problem.‚Äù  They don‚Äôt KNOW how to form relationships.  They know how to have sex, but not how to communicate or how to be a desirable person outside of the bedroom.    The don‚Äôt know how to be an interesting person someone else would *want* to form a lasting relationship with. 

Listen: There is nothing wrong if you want to hook up.  If you want to have a lot of partners AND that makes you flourish as a human being, then fine.  But more often than not what I see are people SAYING they want something more, but seeming like they don‚Äôt know how to properly form relationships that last.  Of the people I know that say this (every single gay guy I know), almost all of them are sleeping around like crazy, using these apps and craigslist and then wondering why their relationships don‚Äôt last. 

It‚Äôs not that hard to understand guys.  

Sigh...anyway, I know this just sounds like some self-aggrandizing, self-serving, preachy rant, but I really do see so many of us making our lives harder than have to be because we don‚Äôt know how to function properly in the relationship world.  All I'm saying is this: If you want to form lasting relationships, take the time to get to know yourself and the person you are interested in before jumping into bed with them.  Does that sound old fashioned? It shouldn‚Äôt.  It‚Äôs just common sense really.  

If you find yourself constantly single and can‚Äôt figure out why, ask yourself these questions:

1.  What am I doing (or not doing) repeatedly that leads me to the same situations?
2.  Do I care about others, or am I too obsessed with myself?
3.  Am I caught up on physical attributes?
4.  If yes to number 3, do I have a realistic ideal about what someone SHOULD look like?
5.  Am I able to accept the normal, human flaws in another person or do I have a completely unrealistic picture of perfection in my mind?
6.  Am I asking the right questions of people I date and getting to know them well, or am I fucking first and asking the questions later?

And most importantly:

(7.)  Am I an interesting, kind and thoughtful person that someone would WANT to date long term?

If you answered no to any of the things in number 7 you‚Äôve got work to do.  

Maybe you are nice but you are a bore: You have no hobbies or interests other than surfing the internet or playing video games and you can‚Äôt speak intelligently about anything.  Yawn.  Improve yourself.  Read a book.  Become knowledgable about a lot of subjects so you can have tons of conversations about all kinds of topics.  Experience the world outside your door.  Go to a coffee shop and strike up conversations with strangers to become a better communicator. 

Maybe you are knowledgeable and interesting but unkind or self obsessed.  I see this a LOT.  I am AMAZED by the narcissism in our community and I see the toll it takes on personal relationships.  Drop the grindr and work on yourself some more. Quit texting your chest photos before you talk about your ideals and your real life.  Become something more than an internet piece of meat if you want to have relationships more meaningful than hooking up.  If not...fine.  But just know who you are, what you are doing and what you are REALLY looking for.   

Anyway...blah blah.  You get the idea.  Ending old man rant transmission.   Take it or leave it.  :)

EDIT: Reddit gold! Awesome! Thanks whoever you are! (Now I need to figure out what it is and use it...hahah!)

I'm not sure why, exactly, but here it is. Sorry in advance for the Wall-o-Text.

Last June I went to my first Pride party, after living in NYC for 10 years and going to precisely zero Pride-related anythings. It wasn't a big official thing, just a house party thrown by a gay couple and their friends, and one of my friends brought me along. 

I'd been having a pretty rough couple of months, and the invitation came as a welcome surprise. I can be really shy in a room full of new people, but I was feeling good and charming, and I had no problem making conversation. I can be a real clown, and making people laugh is one of my favorite things to do. If I'm making people laugh, it's a good night, and I was making people laugh, at least at first. But I never really connected with anyone, and conversation after conversation ended after a few minutes. I was having trouble participating because people were talking about things‚Äî""gay"" things‚ÄîI didn't have the first clue about. 

At some point, not feeling too hot about myself, I went to the kitchen to make myself another drink. Two hot guys struck up a conversation with me, and we talked for a good 45 minutes about lots of different things. I was having a good time with them, and I was starting to feel better. 

Eventually one of the guys turned kind of earnest and looked me in the eye. ""So, it's really cool that you're here,"" he said. ""Uh, thanks?"" I said, smiling politely, not at all sure what he meant, ""but why?"" 

""Well, because you're not gay, right? It's so cool that you're straight and at a gay pride party!""

Huh. I looked down at what I was wearing: plain-jane t-shirt (not tight, but showed off the guns a little bit), cargo shorts, Vans. Nothing out of the ordinary. ""No, no, I'm gay,"" I said. Then, trying to joke my way out of it, ""I know I'm not dressed appropriately for this, but you don't need to rub it in!"" He laughed. The conversation moved on.

Shortly after that I said good night and went home. Something about the exchange really bothered me, but I couldn't tell what it was. Eventually I figured it out. Ten years ago (and even more recently than that), if someone read me as straight, I would take it as a compliment: I'd succeeded! And if a *gay* person read me as straight, it was like a straight-acting grand slam! I **won!** I'd be so proud of what I'd accomplished. It'd be a badge of honor. Getting read as straight *at a gay pride party* would have been‚Äîshould have been‚Äîlike winning the straight-acting super bowl. 

Now, instead, all I felt was extreme alienation. I didn't care that they thought I was straight. All I cared about was the fact that they thought I was different, that I didn't belong that obviously. Being read as straight didn't make me proud anymore; it just made me sad. I didn't care how ""masculine"" or ""straight-acting"" anyone else at that party was. I just wanted to fit in, to belong, to be with ""my own kind,"" you know? 

Which is why I was so happy when I found r/gaybros. To me, this is a place where I can be myself‚Äîtalk about what I want to talk about, like what I like, love what I love‚Äîwith other gay dudes who, even if they don't have those things in common with me, won't judge me for them the way that other, more mainstream gays have judged me.

And which is also why some of what's gone on here in the last week has bothered me. Feel like mocking that ""adonis-body"" guy's problems? Guess what: I've worked just as hard on my mind as he has on his body, and I've been openly made fun of in gay bars for being smart. Think it's unmanly to like receiving flowers? Yeah, I'd be *so fucking happy* if one of you guys gave me flowers. So what? 

Don't like that there are guys who post here who aren't ""really bros""? Guess what: I used to be a lot more flaming than I am now. I came out at 15 and spent the next 5 years trying to figure out ""how to be gay,"" and that included walking/talking/dressing ""gay"" for a while, during which time I had things shouted at me, bottles thrown at me from moving cars, fights started with me. I was being true to myself then, just as I'm being true to myself now. Later, two of the greatest loves of my life were pretty effeminate, as is one of my best gay buddies now. They are beautiful guys inside and out, and I didn't care then and sure as hell don't care now if they're ""bros"" or not.

And so I guess this is all to say: *enough* with the Masculinity Police. If you're 100% bro, awesome. If you're a big flamer, you let your flamer flag fly, man. Are you ripped? A cub? A skinny dude? Doesn't matter. **You be whoever you are, and be damn proud, and don't let anyone tell you different.** I love that this sub is a place where I can be myself, but as someone who's been excluded from groups of gay guys more times than I care to count, that vibe gets ruined for me as soon as we start excluding others for not being _____ enough, or making people feel bad for what they like or don't like, or declaring ""rules"" for what is/isn't allowed. It *sucks* to be excluded like that, bros, and I've been on the shit-end of that too many times‚Äîfirst as a flamer among straightbros, then as a gaybro among flamers‚Äîfor me to **ever** be okay with it being done to others. Are you kind, honest and trustworthy? Those are the only things that matter to me.

TL;DR Real men don't worry about, much less police or adjudicate, the manliness of others. We're all brothers here, and I think we've *all* experienced more than our fair share of shame in our lives. Enough already.

That's all. In the immortal words of Bob Ross, take care of yourselves, and each other.",,False,self,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_197zey,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/197zey/bros_apropos_of_some_of_the_recent_judgey/,

For a little background:  I was very tall and skinny and was very moody, easily afraid, and often had had my ass kicked. I was also one of the few openly gay people I in town.

I was walking in downtown Fort Collins to meet some friends at someplace I can‚Äôt recall at the moment. While I was walking a guy almost clips me while riding his bike and yells back at me: 

‚ÄúWatch it FAGGOT‚Äù

My world goes red, I drop my back pack and start running after him, virtually frothing at the mouth and spewing obscenities. Completely intent on catching up to this asshole and beating him until there is nothing recognizably human left. 

One of the friends who I was walking to meet, steps out in front of me. It‚Äôs like running into a brick wall. For clarity he‚Äôs taller than I am and has about 100 pounds on me at that point in my life. He wraps his arms around me.

He doesn't let go.

I‚Äôm still screaming and swearing and trying my hardest to break his grip, but he‚Äôs got my hands pinned to my sides. My anger redirects from the cyclist to my friend. I start yelling at him, venting all my rage and anger at the world on him. Struggling desperately to break free.  

He doesn't let go. 

Eventually my anger fades and I start crying.  No matter how many times I‚Äôm called a fag, or thrown in lockers, or hit or spit on. It still hurts. This deep well of pain comes bubbling up. My friend‚Äôs grip changes from one of restraint to one of comfort. 

And still he doesn't let go. 

The storm of emotions lasts about 10 minutes, he and I standing on the main drag of our town he‚Äôs holding me tight while I fall apart. Completely unselfconscious about holding the gay kid, the faggot, while he weeps for a broken life. I've never forgotten that moment. I have never stopped being grateful for him being strong for me when I wasn't. 

That‚Äôs what I mean when I say a hug is a commitment.

But about a week ago or so I decided that I wanted to experiment with this side of me and see what it was all about. I met a guy on plentyoffish and we started texing back and forth. Well we talked for like 5-6 days, swapped pics, etc. I asked him out on a date a few days ago, and he agreed.

We ate dinner at a nice restaurant, went and got starbucks and went to a park to walk around at sunset and see a little fireworks show. I was kinda worried that he wasn't that in to it or something, but we drove around and talked for a little bit and eventually found a place to park.

I won't go in to graphic detail (unless you want me to, lol) but suffice to say that I had my first real gay experience tonight and nothing in my whole entire life has ever felt so right. We kissed and played with each other, held hands, it was fucking perfect.

So I guess what I'm saying is that I'm totally gay and needed someone to share that with. ",,False,self,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_1i7byn,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1i7byn/just_had_my_first_date_with_a_guyholy_shit/,

My mom hasn't acknowledged the fact that I'm gay at all since I came out. She has denied it and not accepted me since the end of my sophomore year of high school. 

Today, *OUT OF NOWHERE*, she tells me she doesn't care if I'm gay, or straight, or whatever. It doesn't make her love me any less and it doesn't make her any less proud to call me her son. 

She even acknowledged my relationship that has existed for three years as of October of this year. She said that since my older brothers don't want kids, that Travis and I better adopt twins: one boy, one girl.

Normally I keep to myself and only really interact with people if they ask questions, but I do have a couple of ""regulars"" whose names I've remembered and typically greet with an extra smile or whatnot.

For a couple of months now, I've had a regular come in, who I'll call G. With a darker skin tone and a calm, quiet demeanor, G instantly got to be my favorite regular to come in. He and I would occasionally chatter in Spanish, and I learned he worked in construction--which was clearly evident in his naturally lean build.

I was taken aback by him. A soft-spoken, handsome man who read Conrad and Kamarov--and my young 20-year-old bookseller self who occasionally glanced from afar. I felt in a totally different world than him. I felt even slightly foolish, for even looking at him.

*""Tienes una familia, en Mexico?""* I asked one evening.

He replied no. No kids. No wife. Just him, here in Southern California.

It made me hopeful. 

Time passed by and we occasionally greeted each other and shared small talk every now and then. My thoughts would still be the same everytime--""Maybe?""

I soon found myself plucking the courage one evening to give a person my number, another individual who I saw sitting down. A bit younger and perhaps a little more fem. 

The other individual and I talked for three weeks. He was not for me. Obsessive, melodramatic, and overall clingy. 

I let it go. It made me realize what I actually wanted. I wanted to talk to G.

Last Tuesday, I sat in the breakroom contemplating my lunch, when I decided to go outside to see G.

""Please talk to me before you leave. There is something I would like to tell you,"" I say very formally in Spanish.

The time comes: *""Ya me voy, Servin22.""*

I sit down next to him. 

I look at his face.

And I then look away.

*""Pues...me gustas.""* I choke out. I laugh with embarrassment, just to shrug it off, and then I continue. ""I've liked you for a long time, and decided you deserved to know. I do not expect you to feel the same, but all the same...""

I trail off, eager for a response. With wide eyes, he looks at me and breathes deeply.

*""Eres muy guapo.""* 

""You're--too?""

""Yep.""

We exchanged numbers that night, and now we're talking. We are casual friends with a hint of something more to come. Eventually I hope to have a proper date with him. I feel so much happier! Please, if you think you can do it, just go for it! Who knows, something like this can happen too!

**TL;DR: You won't know what'll happen if you never say anything.** Sorry for wall o' text.

Edit: Slight grammar stuff.

Try to subtly catch everyone's reaction. The straight people won't bat an eye, but those for whom the name Sean Cody has a bit more meaning will probably react somehow. You won't get every one for sure, but the first couple times I tried this I saw a few guys' heads literally jerk around when the heard the name.

But I never really felt like I had anything to contribute or it was fair to contribute because I wasn't  sure I fit in here. Honestly, finding this place was probably the first step to figuring out that I wasn't bi like I'd been telling myslef for years. I'm a big believer in sexuality being a spectrum but its time to call a spade a spade... I'm gay. And now I have to tell her. 

I said it out loud for the first time yesterday and I should have told her last night but I couldn't make myself say it. I came home and she was happy to see me and hugged me. I couldn't pull it all apart. 10 years. A third of our lives. A marriage. A home. A happy life.  A life that is exactly what we are all told we should want that I could not, despite my best efforts, cram myself to fit in. Love... She hugged me and I wanted just one more night of us. I wanted one more night to be with her, and be happy, and be normal. 

This is sappy and sad and sorry but I had to write it down and make someone else see it because I have to tell her tonight. And I'm scared. And embarrassed that it took me so long to figure out. And I'm going to always remember this night ( and so will she) and it will not be a good memory and I am terrified it will be the one she remembers the last 10 years by. I'm horrified that I stole 10 years from her... And from me.  And I needed to write it down and for anonymous people on the Internet to read it so maybe I won't chicken out. So it can be done. So we can both be free. So I can stop pushing down that voice of excitement for what's to come that is hanging in the back of my head that I keep pushing down  the same way I've pushed down the parts of me I convinced myself long ago were wrong.

Sorry for spewing. Sorry I never let the emo gay teen of youth come out and this is the way it manifested. And thanks for reading it and making it actually real outside my head. 

Edit: Whoa! Thanks guys... If I'm being honest there was nothing new to me said here (and that includes the negative) but it helps to hear it from others. I appreciate the support and those who had advice. I am no less scared and no less nervous. But at least now I feel more compelled or at the very least less likely to back out. Thanks guys...

when i was 16 my hormones were on overdrive and i just wanted to fuck around a lot. i didn't want it to be someone from school because high schoolers are dicks and homophobics. i put up an ad on craigslist and i got a lot of replies. i picked out one that seemed fairly un-creepy (but what did a 16 year old know lol) and we met. he was the dilf of my dreams. fucked around a lot in his house. he was 38 and married. that's not the crazy part.

he invited me over for dinner with his wife. scared the shit out of me because wtf was he planning. but my penis did all the thinking and before i knew it i was having a lovely dinner with them. and by that i mean he introduced me as ""the rentboy"" who he ""hired for them"", and i was ""paid"" to watch and jerk off to them while they had sex. at one point, i got invited to fuck his wife (being the teenager i was, i could pretty much stick it in anyone without a problem) while the dad jerked off to us.

that happened a couple more times. whenever me and dilf would meet to fuck (without the wife), he'd talk real dirty to me and ask me ""so you like fucking my wife you little shit?"" or some other derivative of that. made sex a whole lot more enjoyable. wife only knew me as the ""rentboy"" and not as the 16 year old who liked getting railed by his husband.

fast forward to when i was 18. i started boning their closeted son. he didn't know i fucked both of his parents, they didn't know i fucked their son.

I want you to post more /r/gaybrosgonewild proudly so I can have more to fap to. It seems like only the guys with 7""+ have the confidence to post because of society and whatnot and it's not doing too much for me.  
  
I think that if instead of hiding and being scared, that you own your normal-sized cock and be vocal and open about it. Start being more confident so other guys can have someone to look up to. I'm having trouble finding smaller guys and it's because you are all hiding. I love big cocks and I love average and small cocks. They all do it for me, but big ones get tiring when it's all you see.  
  
Hell, if you've got a hot body please audition for porn. I want smaller penises in porn. I'm a total bottom and I want to fantasize about getting pounded by you hitting my prostate at the right angle.  
  
Seriously, my point is to just know that people out there do find you're sexy. You can still make my toes curl and you can be one hell if a fuck. Stop hiding in the shadows and start hiding under the bed sheets.  
  
On top of what happened to my friend, I just read some horrible things about guys going celibate or killing themselves because of this. Please don't. You'll be missing out on a lifetime of happiness and someone you were meant to be with will never find you and miss out on being with an amazing person. He happened to be the best lay I've ever had. He was also my best friend and an amazing, caring person. RIP.

1361335872.0,377,self.gaybros,18va2f,My top 10 Bro tips ,franzinvan,461,84,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/18va2f/my_top_10_bro_tips/,"So this is my first post, it ain't meant to sound preachy or too Dr.Phil. Just a few honest tips I wish I had known in the beginning of my homobro journey!

* 1 - **Give people more credit, especially when coming out.**

 Almost everybody I came out to that mattered surprised me with positive reactions, even a friend who once told me randomly ""I'd never speak to you if you were gay"".

* 2 - **Do everything on your own timeline.**

 I came out at 23, I know a lot of people come out later than that, but to me that's still a long time to not be living my real life.  Im glad I came out a bit later, I was more grounded and sure of who I was and strong enough to accept potential rejection from people closest to me. 

* 3 - **Learn to appreciate your community.**  

I remember when I initially came out, I felt like I didn't fit into any real category of guys that surrounded me. Because of that, I actually started being very closed minded and not making any efforts to connect and get to know people. Cut to a few years later and major attitude changes and the ""fabulous"" guys I initially was uncomfortable around or the older ""not traditionally good looking"" guys I didn't give the time of day to have become good friends and mentors.  I think it's easy to forget that regardless of the ""category"" you fit into, we've all been through very similar journeys and can help each other out and connect on different levels than with straight people.

* 4 - **Don't fall in love with the terminally single older playboy.**  

Just don't, you will never change him and chasing him will fuck you up in many future relationships.

* 5 - **It's okay to be gay.**  

I'm kind of a guy's guy, I grew up in a small town, any unconsciously effeminate mannerisms or any traditionally female interests were quickly teased or beaten out of me at a young age (In the school, not at home).  High School and College brought out even more hyper-masculinity when I was trying to mask being gay. It took a little while after I came out but there came a point where I just said fuck it, I like what I like! I can have an awesome man day at the gun range and the pub but still come home and watch Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and not give a fuck.  Pro tip: One of the most awesome things about being gay is you don't have to make yourself fit in any traditional boxes, do what ever you want! If it's gay then.. so be it!

* 6 - **Always walk into a bar with a smile on.**

Guys who are positive and approachable have way more people come up and talk to them than the gorgeous stone faced hunk. 

* 7 - **Take a break from Grindr/Scruff/Manhunt/etc. etc. etc. etc. and take a step into real life.**  

One of the most liberating things I ever did was get rid of all my online gay ""social networking"" apps.  Now I ain't into the whole quick hookup thing so if I was I would probably be online right now! I have met some great people off those sites, dated a few, made some great friends but people online are usually not the same as in real life. I'm not even talking about fake profiles, I'm talking about the fact that when you are able to judge people off a picture and a tag line while being behind the safety of a cell phone screen real people just become thumbnails and text.  Now I am not saying I will never go online again but I have a lot better time meeting people through friends or during a night out at this point. Also it's kind of fun walking into a bar and having people check you out because you are a bit mysterious, not because you are a fixture on their Grindr grid (that may not have replied to their messages :S ).

* 8 - **Suit up. And ask questions. Always.** 

My first gay sexual experience was with somebody I did not know was HIV+. I found out as I was about to go down on him and he finally decided to stop me. Now yes I know the stats for oral transmission but god damn that was a scary first time, that could have easily been prevented. 

* 9 - **Don't be in such a rush to get into a relationship.** 

Give yourself some time to get to know yourself, date a few people to get to know what you really want out of a partner. Most of all be okay with being alone not just because you ARE alone but because you are pretty damn awesome and in the end it's just you bro. You want the guy you meet to compliment your life (and vice versa) not be the reason you live it. 

* 10 - **Accept the fact that you may never actually understand House Music..**

or how to dance to it.. Ever.",,False,self,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_18va2f,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/18va2f/my_top_10_bro_tips/,

Sorry it's a novel, but I had to get it out. Over the weekend, I came out to my parents. I didn't plan for it to happen until after I graduated college, but it just came to a head and was unavoidable. 

The plan for the summer was for me to move back in with my parents in and work full time at a bakery. Things were tense all month as I had started meeting guys that I could go out to the local clubs with and dance and have a few drinks. Of course I just told my parents I was going to see a late movie or going to friends' houses. But my mom knew something was up, she called it God talking to her; I call it seeing the obvious. Finally, it all came to a head this weekend while my sister was enrolling for her first year at college (we are attending the same one now). I was supposed to be moving out of my house that weekend as well, so we were all in the same place. Things happened that caused my mom to break, and started accusing me of hiding things, and why was I so protective of my phone, and on and on. So my mom and dad and I sat down in my living room and I came out to them. My dad was furious, started yelling at me; my mom nearly fainted, was crying and the last thing she said before she left was, ""You stay away from me, and you stay away from (my sister)."" 

Within literally 17 minutes of them leaving, they cancelled my car insurance, health insurance, blocked my on facebook, my cell phone was deactivated, and they had left with my paycheck which I was going to use as a deposit for a new apartment. I used facebook to communicate with some friends a little older and much more established than me in a bigger city about an hour away. They told me to grab as much valuable stuff as I could and come down and stay with them for the night. I did, and they were angels. The next day I went back to my house to finish moving my stuff, I found my parents had come back and taken a lot of my stuff. They have half of my clothes, my jeans and summer stuff, and lots of random things were gone. I also learned that my mom had told my boss to fire me (which she did initially and then took it back the next day, but I don't know if I would feel comfortable going back anyways) It was devastating to see that they were trying to hurt me like that. I came back to my friends in the City and they have just been incredible, taking care of me, giving me some of their clothes that didn't fit them to replace some of what my parents took, they even put me on their cell phone plan with one of their old flip phones until I am able to get more established. I am still figuring things out, looking for job, house, etc., but I know it will get better. If anything I am concerned for my sister. We were so close especially these last few years. I actually intended to come out to her before anyone else, and I know she would have been fine with it, if she didn't know already. I didn't even get to say goodbye to her they shut me off so quickly, and I know they are monitoring her phone for me to text her. Eventually I will figure out someway to contact her, but I don't want her to suffer because of me. But I made the right choice. I am free. Even though I have lost my family, I am so happy that I can finally be who I am without hiding anything.

EDIT 1: I just woke up and saw the incredible love and support you guys are giving me, and it is bringing me to tears. Thank you all so much, and I promise to go through and read every one of the comments on here. Many people are asking what city I am in. I am looking for a house and a job in Stillwater, OK. Thank you guys, y'all are incredible.

EDIT 2: I need to explain the whole job/stolen paycheck thing a little. I worked for a bakery in Tulsa that was owned by a precious friend of the family (went to hs with my mom). I had both mine and my sister's paychecks in my backpack, and when I looked after they left, both were gone. Later that night when I was at the friends house (who are a gay couple btw) i received this message on fb from my SISTER's account but it was undoubtedly written by my mom: [message](http://i.imgur.com/wXy3D.png). So I called my boss the next morning from my friend's phone to see if I was indeed fired. Boss (like a second mother) was concerned crying etc, but long story short, I repeatedly said that I had not quit (just in case so I would have legal protection behind me), but she ended with I have to respect your mom's request (this is how scarily controlling my mom can be). Next morning I get a call on friend's phone saying after talking with her business partners, they can't fire me because that would be discrimination (smart). So I technically still have a job there, but I really don't want to go back to Tulsa at all, I need to leave that behind me. 
I did ask her to cancel my paycheck and reissue it, but she said that she talked to my mom and they were going to deposit it. I have yet to see that happen, but if they don't by the days end I will be considering filing a police report.

EDIT 3: Just wanted to give y'all a quick update because each and every one of you has been so kind to me, I wish I could thank every one of you personally. They DID deposit the check into MY account, so that is a big worry off my shoulders. As far as the other stuff goes, I really could use my jeans, shorts, and t-shirts they have, but those are really the only things I need back. Not sure how I am going to go about that one. I don't want any contact with them, but I'll figure it out. Not entirely enthusiastic about bringing the police into it. I have sent messages out to my sister's friends asking them to pass along the message. We'll see if that happens. I also got in touch with the local PFLAG and they are going to pass my resume around to see if I can't get a job. It's starting to come together nice and steadily. I will feel so much better once I have a job.

But I also like knives, explosions, action films, female super heroes in scantly clad clothing, power tools, fishing, hiking, photography, grilling (especially freshly picked corn on the cob!), and other ""masculine"" things. Earlier this year I went shooting for the first time, and have surprisingly good accuracy for someone so shaky. 

(Side note: I've never had ""masculine privilege"", in fact I'm still often mistaken for a girl.)

In Gaybros I have found a group that I can share with others the more masculine things I love without having to fear being an outcast because of my homosexuality. Just as I have finally found Gaymers to share in my love of gaming without having to worry about all the macho guys/boys that think girls and gays shouldn't play video games.

The great thing about these groups is that I don't feel pressured to be anything I'm not. I don't have to worry about being called down because I'm not masculine enough, not effeminate enough, not gay enough, too gay, or anything else. I can simply be gay and like video games while I'm discussing things in Gaymers. And I can simple be gay and like ""manly"" things while I'm discussing things in Gaybros.

So thanks for being such great people! The atmosphere here is incredibly great and I hope to stop lurking and take a more active part in this community going forward.

PS: The guns I fired were a 45 Glock, a 45 single-action cowboy style revolver, a Mossberg 715T 22LR (my favorite), and a 12 gauge pump-action shotgun.


Edit: My intention was not to have my ego stroked, fight over what makes you a gaybro, fight over what this sub is about, or take over this sub with my feminine interests. There are subs out there that I can share my feminine interests with, and I love that this is a community where I can share my more masculine interests. I posted this in response to the Huff Post video. I felt like this great sub was needlessly bashed and mislabeled. This is a great community that I feel is open to guys like me, who may not be manly and masculine or ""bro"" bro, and I just thought I would express that here. I certainly never expected to get more than a couple of comments. I thank every one of you who took the time to read, or skim, my post and comment.

I live at home hence we go to his place, which is isn't to far from me. I'm really nervous at this point because I haven't met up with anyone using Grindr and I've read some horror stories. Well anyway he comes to get me and I go up with him to his apartment (very nice one btw). We get up there and are chatting away while watching TBS when he leans in and start making out with me. It starts to get more and more passionate and we rip off our clothes like animals. He's sucking my cock and then gets on top of me. He puts a condom on me and starts riding my dick. This feels crazy good and I've never done anal before. He's riding me so hard and this is his first time bottoming also, and before we know it we are both blowing our loads.

Last night I went over to his apartment to eat pizza, drink (wine for me, beer for him), and play Halo 4. Well about an hour in his roomates come home, so we decide to go up to his room to watch a movie on my laptop. 

Up to the point we crawled onto his bed and he put his arm around me I wasn't sure if he liked me- but after that I start snuggling up to him and rubbing his arm with my hand. About 20 minutes into the movie I commented on his ability to grow a beard. He asks if I want to feel it, so I start stroking it and looking into his eyes. 

After a minute I say that I've never kissed a guy with a beard before. He says something and then I go in for the kiss. At this point it becomes obvious he'd been waiting for that and we start making out. Clothes eventually come off and he's got hair in *all* the right places. 

As it turns out, he was a virgin(!) and I've only been with one other guy as a bottom, so he agrees to fuck me. He was bigger than the other guy, so it took a few minutes for me to get comfortable. After he finished he got rid of the condom and we cuddled for a little while, before he asked me to fuck him. 

I told him I had only topped once before but I'd do my best. I spent a few minutes stretching him, and making sure his hole and the condom were thoroughly lubed. Finally we're ready and I slowly push in. 

Bros, the sex was A-MAZ-ING. I pounded him for about twenty minutes and in three positions, with him moaning in pleasure almost the whole time. We went slow, we went fast, we went gentle, and we went rough. I discovered that I like being a somewhat aggressive top, and left hickeys all over his shoulders and chest. 

That session ended when I made him cum hands-free; on his knees with us chest-to-back and my arm around his chest. 

We cleaned up and cuddled for about half an hour before going to a party he knew about, which is another story. 


TL;DR- Date night with guy I'm really into. We have sex, I made him cum hands-free, and swiped his v-card at the same time. 


Also, he's now going to be my date for my fraternity's semi-formal at the end of this month. :D",,True,nsfw,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_13enhe,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/13enhe/bros_last_night_was_amazing/,

Anyway, I try not to focus on it too much, but I really like smelling dudes. It turns me on, it makes me feel close to someone - I think there must just be a really strong link between smell and the emotional part in my brain or something. I love nuzzling a guy's pit and falling asleep - though I'm not selfish and am down for some spoonage too.

So would this weird you out? All the other mammals get to sniff each other when they meet without it being weird, lucky bastards!

I was on a kind-of date at the game and was pretty drunk myself, so I had no problem turning around, giving her the stink eye, and asking ""and what's wrong with being fucked in the ass by a man?""

The instant, shocked silence from her and her friends was *awesome*.  I stared her down for a few seconds longer to let the silence sink in, then turned around and enjoyed (well not really, considering the outcome) the rest of the game.

I *hated* men who acted feminine in anyway possible. My online profile would include lines like ""I like men, not men who act like women"". Finding GayBros I thought I found others like me.

I quickly learned that this community was nothing like the way I acted. Everyone was welcoming to everyone fem, trans, etc. I saw many different post that would help me find myself and better myself. I no longer have the same mindset I used to.

I am now out, in a happy relationship, have different gay friends including many feminine gays to cross-dressers to other bros. Because of this community I stopped spreading hate. I am **finally** happy with myself. 

So just wanted to thank you all, hope everyone will keep this up and open minds like you did mine.

You might have seen a pretty popular AMA today about a gay man in an HIV vaccine trial.  Unfortunately he seems to be pretty misinformed about the trial, the vaccine, inclusion criteria etc.  I joined the same trial (HVTN 505) back in the fall of 2009 and and completed it this past spring.  I continue to be tested every three months at the study site because if I was given the vaccine (50:50 chance it was a placebo) there is a chance I could receive a false-positive result on HIV antibody tests, so the trial center offers free nucleic acid- testing for life (this test looks for the virus itself, not antibodies to the virus).

If you have any questions about the trial I'm happy to answer them!

I'm a marine and served in Operation Enduring Freedom. I am also, as of May of 2012, openly gay. In May of last year, I made the decision to come out and let the world know I'm gay. It was also the last time I heard from my father for the next 10 months.  I assumed he was hurt and ashamed of me as he made no attempt to contact me and I was unfriended by him amd his wife (stepmom). It hurt thinking that the guy I had looked up to my entire life wanted nothing to do with me.

Fast forward to last night. I flew to Florida to visit family and finally see my dad. Things were kinda tense for the first few days until last night. So dad and I were drinking some rum when my stepmom (who I've talked to already about my boyfriend) brings up possibly bringing him down to Florida which leads to us talking about my coming out. He told me he was never ashamed, just taken aback by it. He tells me he puts me on a pedestal and is proud of me and the man I've become. That he loves me and looks up to me. I'm a man who is very rarely at a loss for words. I was speechless. I strained to hold back my tears. Bros, he is my hero and I love the guy. I don't think I've ever felt closer to my dad. 

Bros, since joining gaybros my life has gotten better and better. Cloud nine doesn't come close to describing how I feel. I thank God everyday that I have a loving family and amazing boyfriend.

Six months ago I was bored, and a fellow member of outserve (an organization of gay servicemembers) started chatting with me. Neither of us had anything going on the next day, so we agreed on coffee in his town, about 40 miles away. I honestly didn't even realize I was being asked out. I can be naive at times. Well, we had coffee. Then we walked around town. Then we saw a movie. Then we had dinner. And by then we had both realized something significant was happening. I went home, and hoped for more.

And I got more.

We had a couple more amazing dates during which the hours flew by. And then we made it official: boyfriends. He deployed for a few months before coming home early (for family reasons outside his control). We finally got to ""I love you"", and realized we'd both wanted to say those words for a while. Things were wonderful.

During those 6 months, I was so happy. Just the thought of him made me smile during my worst days. He was so considerate. My grandmother passed, and even though he was far away at the time, he sent me flowers and made time to call me every day.

I have loved a couple other men in my life, but I was in the closet, and never had the courage to tell them. At age 30, this was the first time that someone I love also loved me.

But life can be a bitch sometimes.

We're in different military services. He'll be leaving in a couple months to be stationed in another country for several years. I'm expecting orders soon, too, but I don't know where I'll be. Basically, we'd be unlikely even to see each other for the next 4 years, except in brief occasions.

We decided to put an end to our relationship as boyfriends. This morning was our last date together.

I'm usually a pretty strong guy, but I'm bawling as I write this. If I had been working at a conventional job, I would have left it for him. I know the commitments I've made.

I've never hurt like this before. He's been one of the highlights of my life.

I feel a total paradox:

On one hand, I'm so happy I got to be his boyfriend for 6 great months. He made me feel unafraid about being gay in the military. We still get to be friends, and that's so much more than most couples get when they part ways. I know I really feel true love for him, because I want him to be happy even if it can't be with me.

On the other hand, I just want to cry. I want the happy ending. I want to hold him.

I'm happy I got to be part of his life for awhile. I'm sure the pain will ease at some point, but right now I'm so sad.

How do I deal with this? How have you dealt with something like this?

I'm so glad I have some sort of outlet for my grief. Thanks guys.",,False,self,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_1a1vdv,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1a1vdv/hurting_tonight_bros/,

I was wrong to delete the post, and I am sorry. 

I would have preferred the post be a discussion instead of just a link, but even then I should have let the votes decide it. The OP really made me think with his comment

&gt; I would think that sex, sexuality, and sexual health are extremely relevant and well within the confines of what you're describing.

I've restored the post, which you can find [by clicking here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/uukyf/rhivaids_a_subreddit_for_news_discussion_and/)

Though health related topics aren't the focus of this subreddit, I do believe it is important to be aware of the issues **that affect everyone who is sexually active**. Just because it is not a gay or straight issue does not mean it isn't real.

That's right guys, my little brother, who's 10/9, hates me because I broke up with my boyfriend. The thing is I have no boyfriend and he's misunderstanding the situation.

My other brothers and my friends all joke that my friend J, is my boyfriend even though he's straight. The reason why is because we're always together and we bicker as lovers. People always asume we're together but we usually correct them. My little brother always thought ,since he was 5, that he was truely my boyfriend and I recently stop hanging around J because I have work and was seeing someone. My brothers jokenly said that I broke up with J, and my lil brother then yelled at me and told me he liked J and how he hates me and will never talk to me. I tried to explain that J is straight and that we're just good friends, and he told me I'm lying and won't listen to me or my brothers. Its been a couple of weeks and he's still mad. I don't know how to convience the little twerp



TL;DR my lil brother hates me because he thinks i broke up with my bf, who's actually straight and a friend

I run into him again in the juice aisle at which point he says ""You know if I'm going to keep running into you, I should know your name. Probably should give me your number though just in case I don't run into you, this way I can call and make sure you're okay, or you know for dinner.""

Seriously, everybody chill. 

Too many topics lately on defining what a bro is (hint: there is no definition, it's just a word and term of endearment. It doesn't get ANY more complicated than that) and arguing about the content on the sub (hint 2: if you don't like what you see, post what you would like to see and encourage others to do so. Actually use those arrow buttons). 

This place is for gay dudes who want to talk about the greatest daily carry knife, their camping trip last weekend, military experiences, working out, getting in or avoiding fights, trying out for a team, the best chili recipe, how to properly BBQ a rack of ribs, their latest computer build, what vidya game they want for xmas, whether 007 Skyfall is going to live up to the hype, and how perfect the Boston Bruins are. All while being gay friendly and not worrying about talking about their bf or the fact that the trip to the Red Sox game was a date with another guy. Sure we have fap-day friday because we are sexual creatures and have advice posts now and then because many of us are young or having issues in our lives and have found friends here, but don't let that cause you to forget why we came here in the first place: to **just chill and talk about guy stuff** with people who don't give two shits that we are gay. 

So cool it, stop arguing with each other, and just have a good time.

I'll get downvoted a shit ton but I don't care, what I do care about is having our subreddit back. The one I joined a long while ago just seems like a distant memory.

**What:** Drinks at the park, with people bringing food ([here's the food list, let us know what you're bringing.]
(https://pad.riseup.net/p/maybrosmeetup). We have a cooler, a table, some ice. Bring drinks if you're gonna drink. Sharing is caring. It won't be too warm (63 as of now?) but it won't be raining so there's that to look forward to.

**Why:** Because sometimes a reddit bay area gay guy wants to go to a park and hang out with other reddit bay area gay guys who like man things like drinking in a park (or not drinking, that's aight) and talking about things. If you've never been to one, neither have a chunk of the people that'll be at this. Live a little, GOD your mom was right about you.

Copy and Pasting THE FAQ (now in **[IMAX3D](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1gl46hh3sQ)**)

------------

**I'm slightly old. Can I come?**

Dude, age is only a number. You gotta free your mind from the constraints of your body, man.


**I'm slightly young. Can I come?**

Come to Dolores. You might not be able to get into bars, but Dolores doesn't card. She very doesn't.


**I'm shy-**

Yo, I don't wanna hear it. We're all nice guys, I think. It's only awkward if you make it awkward. Fake it til you make it. Smile like you mean it. Do what you gotta do.


**Does anyone have a place I can crash at?**

Ask in the comments section! Same for car-pooling.


**If I don't drink, can I still come?**

Yah man. Plenty of guys come and don't drink. After Dolores might include bars, though, so skip it if you wanna skip it, skippy.


**Sounds *LAME*. Do you actually make friends at these things?**

Homie, please. These guys are hella nice.


**Meet up? You mean SEX UP?!?**

Yes, sex does happen.  Yes, people find people to date.  Yes, people hookup immediately after (maybe even during?). But, I shit you not, I think most people just wanna...hang out. Weird. I know.


**Do we have a facebook group?**

Yep. We use it to banter, aks Bay questions, get all territorial-like about our hoods. It's good to have, and it's the best way to find out about the meetups (or set up your own). PM me for details.

(upvote for visibility!),elanheartshaley,280,38,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/13qx3i/gaybro_gift_exchange_signup_thread_upvote_for/,"Inspired by /u/Aeoen's example to organize a [Christmas card exchange](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/13d0wv/gaybros_christmas_card_exchange_signup_thread_v11/), (better sign up for that, the deadline is this Sunday!) I decided to organize a parallel event - the long-awaited, much-desired Gaybro holiday gift exchange! Special thanks by the way to /u/Im_relevant and /u/Broseidon1618 for agreeing to help out, and the mods for their approval and support.

Here's how it works. Apologies for the long list of steps and rules, trust me that there's a reason for all of this. *Read this entire post carefully before you sign up!*

1. Sign up by emailing me at gaybrosgifts@gmail.com, *no later than December 7,* with the following information:
  &gt;* Username

  &gt;* Are you willing to send internationally? (Yes/No)

  &gt;* Approximate location: Continent, country, state/province, city/town

  &gt;* Any special requests? (e.g. someone you don't want to be matched with)


  Use a throwaway email address if you like, but remember to check it regularly until the gift exchange is over. All communications regarding this event will be disseminated either through the email you used to sign up, or by special announcement threads posted on /r/gaybros over the next several weeks, NOT by reddit PM. So if you need to reach me later on regarding a complaint, special request, or whatnot, send an email using that same email address to gaybrosgifts@gmail.com.

2. *Within a few days you should receive an email invitation to the gift exchange from elfster.com*, which we will be using to manage this gift exchange. Upon accepting the invitation, you will be asked to enter your name and mailing address, which will be visible only to your secret santa and to us organizers. You will also be asked to sign up for a membership to elfster.com. This is entirely optional, but will give you access to extra features such as creating a gift wishlist. If you do create an account, *do not use your real name, or log in using Facebook!* By default, your first name will be your reddit username, and your last name will be ""Gaybro"".

3. If all goes according to plan, *your giftee will be selected by no later than December 17*, and hopefully earlier than that. You should receive an email from elfster.com, with a link to your giftee and his address. You may then commence reddit-stalking, subscribing to his wishlist, and purchasing or crafting your gift. The cost of your gift is entirely up to you, but unless you're creating it yourself, we recommend a minimum price of $20 USD. There is no maximum price; you can buy your giftee a car if you want! (That being said, this is NOT a competition.)

4. *Document the gift you're sending.* If it's something you bought or made personally, just take a picture of the package, with the mailing address of your giftee visible in the photo. If you bought it online to be delivered straight to your giftee, just save the confirmation email of your online purchase.

5. *Send your gift by NO LATER THAN January 6, 2013.* A delivery tracking number is recommended, but not required.

6. *Email gaybrosgifts@gmail.com indicating that you have done so, and attach or forward the documentation of your gift.* This will be your proof that you didn't just mooch off the gift exchange without sending anything. This email must also be sent by no later than January 6.

7. *Send a PM to your giftee via reddit letting him know that his gift is on the way*, and approximately when he can expect to receive it. If there's a delivery tracking number for your package, give him that too. If you want to remain anonymous, you can use a throwaway account if you like.

8. When you receive your gift, email me at gaybrosgifts@gmail.com to let me know.

9. Unwrap and enjoy your gift. Happy holidays!


Okay, that was pretty long and complicated. I bet you have some questions!

**Why do we get the mailing addresses so close to Christmas? Why is the mailing deadline AFTER Christmas?**

The first reason is that I want to give people a chance to avoid the hectic pre-Christmas rush while shopping for or creating their gift. If you want you can focus that time on your real-life family and friends, and get started on this when the holiday stress has wound down. The second reason is that this is officially a non-denominational gift exchange. Not everyone's holiday season revolves around December 25th. But the third and real reason is that I waited far too long to get started on this, in the hopes that someone else would step up and do this. Now there's not enough time to get everything done in time, so there's no point in trying. Hey as long as everyone gets a gift, right?

**What if I'm Jewish/Pagan/Buddhist/Hindu/atheist/hate Christmas? Can I still participate?**

Absolutely yes! As I said above, this is officially a non-denominational gift exchange. Feel free to send and receive a gift in the spirit of whatever religious or secular holiday you'd care to celebrate.

**What about international shipping?**

To cut down on shipping costs for everyone, we'll make a good-faith effort to have everyone send a gift to someone else in the same country, or at least the same continent or geographic region. It's for this reason that you're being asked to provide your approximate location. At the same time, we'll try to avoid having people send a gift to someone in the same city or state, to get a good geographic spread. 

**What if I don't receive a gift? What happens to people that don't send one?**

Ah, the big question. In the past, people have taken advantage of the gift exchange to receive a gift without sending one, leaving their giftees high and dry. *We can't give a 100% guarantee that this won't happen to you*, but this time we're taking some steps to mitigate this problem:

1. To be eligible for this gift exchange, you must have a reddit username that has participated in /r/gaybros in the past, either by posting or commenting. This event is only for people who have an identity and reputation at stake in this community, however anonymous. So *do not use a throwaway account for this gift exchange!* We will check. Apologies to all the lurkers that will be excluded by this rule. (For the same reason, we organizers are attaching our regular usernames to this, so we too can be held accountable).

2. As you've probably noticed, we'll try to track each time a gift has been sent and received, so we know whether or not you've fulfilled your part of the bargain. Sometime after the gifts have all been sent and received, and if the mods don't mind, we'll be posting a thread listing all the usernames of the guys that didn't send a gift, as an act of public shaming. If I'm ever crazy enough to organize something like this again, these people will be banned from any such future event.

3. At around the same time, we'll be arranging a simple ""Adopt a giftee"" event. We'll post a thread listing the usernames of all the abandoned participants. You're all encouraged to pick one, PM him to ask for his address, and send him a small consolation gift or card out of the goodness of your heart. This will be entirely voluntary, carries no expectation of getting something in return, and will not be anonymous. We're relying entirely on the awesomeness of the community for this part to work.


**What if this gift exchange goes horribly wrong?**

Honestly, I've never done this before, and neither have /u/Im_relevant and /u/Broseidon1618 as far as I know. I'm pretty much making this up as I go along. All we can promise is to do our best to be fair to everyone and not to screw things up. That said, I'm incredibly busy with real life and am totally insane for volunteering to do this, so apologies if things fall behind schedule. As the organizers, we're reserving the right to change any of the rules or deadlines, or even kick someone out of the gift exchange, if necessary to accommodate any unforseen events. We're also respecting the right of the mods to veto or cancel any or all parts of this gift exchange, if they feel it violates the rules of the sub.

We do offer one ironclad guarantee: your privacy will be respected. None of your real names, locations, and email addresses will be shared with anyone outside of the three of us, not even the mods. As with the [Christmas card exchange](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/13d0wv/gaybros_christmas_card_exchange_signup_thread_v11/), we're not entertaining any requests to send or receive a gift from a specific person. This too is not a tool to find out where your gaybro crush lives.

Well, that's it. Sign up now, and happy holidays!",,False,self,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_13qx3i,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/13qx3i/gaybro_gift_exchange_signup_thread_upvote_for/,

He found out I have a boyfriend. I'm 23 and living with my parents until I leave for Navy Basic Training in November.

He gave me an ultimatum. Break up with my boyfriend or move out. It's a new relationship so we're breaking up when I leave for the navy, but it's not something I want to end before it has to.  

He also said that it will always be like this, as long as I always ""choose a lifestyle of sin"" I will never be allowed in his home; my partner will never be allowed in his home.

I always know what to do when other people get in a situation like this, but with my own life I have no idea. It's obvious that my parents will never view my sexuality as anything but a choice that is against their religion. There's no way to talk him into seeing reason. 

I'm typing this from a friends; I had to get out of the house and beat something up. It was a racquetball or my dads car. I could stay with a friend and my boyfriend but won't have a car.

Do I stick it out for the 2 more months? Do I move out for 2 months? For once, I don't know what to do...

**-----edit-----**

Thank you all for your support and advice. There's a lot of shit in this thread that I hadn't even thought about. It's clear that my actions now will dictate the relationship my father and I have for the rest of our lives.

I have a lot to think about.

Financially, I'm not too well off. I wasn't planning on this shit doing down so I've spent a majority of money paying off some debts before basic. Now I have to save to be able to pay my student loans while I'm in basic training. I'm dealing with the whole, ""2 months of financial stability and bullshit or 2 months of financial hardship and peace of mind,"" internal debate at the moment. It seems like a lot of us are pretty split on the exact same thing.

I know these advice columns get old, and I thought I had all the answers until this shit happened to me. I really appreciate all your help and advice.

At the moment I'm leaning towards this: put up with bullshit for 2 months. Tell my dad I broke up with my boyfriend (if he even asks, attempt to call his bluff), but don't. I'll spend the next two months enjoying my rent free, board free, sinful life saving as much money as I can. I'll make it clear that when I leave for basic that his home is not mine. I will never return so long as I am not loved for all of who I am, not just the parts he picks and chooses.

I'm the type of person who can't make a move until i have all my cards in place. Trust me, while I'm still trying to figure this out, I'll be leaving for good. Either next week, or in two months, I'm done with this shit.

Keep sending your great advice! I haven't made up my mind yet, just leaning in one direction.

---

Now, one thing people have been talking about lately is ""what is a Gaybro?‚Äù. 

I‚Äôll be honest, when I made this place I never thought we‚Äôd get to the point where we *had* to define it. To me, Gaybros was a destination, not a label. Still, here we are and I will do my best to communicate the essence of this amazing community. 

---

Gaybros is a men‚Äôs interest destination, aiming to build a brotherhood around shared interests, promote self acceptance, and bring people together.

We are a diverse group of individuals who share interests that are **generally considered** masculine. While we come here to discuss and participate in those interests and activities, they are by no means boundaries or definitions of our desires or characteristics. 

In other words, just because we like sports or grilling or fixing cars does not preclude us from liking other non-masculine things like pop music or dancing. Nor should anyone ascertain that any one interest is inherently superior than another. Masculinity is something we‚Äôre proud of, but we don‚Äôt think it makes us better than anyone else. We are men of many interests, and this community was formed around *some* of our interests. We aren‚Äôt only Gaybros, we are Gaybros among many other things. In fact, many people may come here just for the company and conversation that results from discussing those interests without participating in them personally - and that is totally cool. We have guys, girls, trans, straight, gay, and bi people among our ranks and *that* is a strength of the community. 

Together, we‚Äôve done countless good deeds and brought together more people than we can likely ever count. We‚Äôve formed friendships in real life, come together at meet ups, brought people together in love, helped our brothers out of depression and assisted them in accepting their sexuality without asking them to change who they are. We‚Äôve done gift exchanges and are raising $10,000 for an incredibly worthy charity. 

People might misunderstand us. People might incorrectly associate us with groups from the past that were less welcoming. People might hear the word bro and assume we‚Äôre misogynists. Those people are wrong. 

Gaybros is an incredible community of genuine, caring, intelligent, strong, confident individuals who have brought a lot of good to the world in a very short time. Own it. Live it. Don‚Äôt let people egg you into dramatic threads and don‚Äôt interact with trolls. Lead by example. Post the content you want to see. Have a thick skin. Be a good friend to your fellow Gaybros, even if they are strangers. For every downvote you may see, give two upvotes to posts or comments you like. This is our community, and this is an amazing community. Gaybros is what I wake up to and the last thing I check before I go to bed. And I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. 

You all rock. Keep it up.

1340669689.0,233,self.gaybros,vlnud,I came out,sympas,271,38,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/vlnud/i_came_out/,"This has been a long time coming and has been extremely emotional for me and my family. Forgive the grammer as I wrote this immediately after it all happening and just needed to get it out there.

Some background information before I launch into my story. Im turning 25 in august. My biological father and mom split when I was about 8. At 16 I stopped talking to my biological father completely because he was emotionally and physically abusive. He made choices and actually verbally told me He was choosing a woman he met over me and that he wanted his life from college back. The only Parents I was left with were my Mom and Stepdad (henceforth just referred to as dad, my mom and stepdad are actually due to marry in July but have known one another for a long time).

I worked hard through college to graduate debt free and got a fulltime job about a month after graduating. I am currently entering the escrow process to buy my own home. My car was purchased for me as a present for graduating college by my dad (I never recieved any gifts for graduating high school or had had a car before). I have my insurance through my mom because on my own I‚Äôve been quoted at 1400 a month in light of not having had my licensee longer than two years and a very serious accident. My mom was born in Iran and is zealously religious when it suits her needs. In Iran if your gay‚Ä¶ its likely you‚Äôll be thrown into jail or worse outright murdered. My mom having been raised muslim and immigrating to the US at the age of 12 was firmly entrenched in this line of thinking. I knew coming out to my mom would have a 90% chance of me being disowned at a minimum.

Sunday night my mother saw a text a date had left me saying ‚Äúgood night baby bear‚Äù. She‚Äôd said she mistook my phone for her own and read the text. She immediately asked ‚Äúwhat the fuck is someone texting you saying goodnight and calling you baby bear?‚Äù shortly followed by ‚Äúthe last time you went out you said you were staying at some guy friends house.‚Äù My Dad stepped in to try and calm things down a bit but my mom was already on a war path. This lead to a night of terror listening to her and my father arguing muffled through walls in their room.

I made plans with friends that night to stay with them in the worst case scenario that I was disowned or kicked out. I could just feel things were going that way. I woke up today and headed to work feeling sick to my stomach emotionally and physically I‚Äôve been ill the last week with a bad cough. I called my dad since he already had somewhat of an inkling of what was going on from comments hes made alluding to the fact he knew I was gay. Hes never outright confronted or asked me before, its just not his way. But I called him and told him everything. I told him I was freaking out because I didn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go. That I was so close to moving out and making it on my own. That all I really wanted was acceptance. That I couldn‚Äôt afford a 1400$ insurance expense monthly when I‚Äôm in the middle of entering escrow on a house if my mom decided to take me off the insurance as part of disowning me. He told me not to worry. Thats all he kept saying.

I left work because I kept having coughing fits and headed home. On my way home my mom called me and laid into me telling me she didnt like that I was deceiving her and lying to her. That she knew. That she and I were going to have a talk when we got home just her and I. I said no my dad will be involved in that talk.

I got home and had time to change and I stepped into the backyard to try and center myself a little before my mom got home with my dad in tow and started laying into me. She opened with

Mom: ‚ÄúI fucking raised you wrong, get inside the fucking house‚Äù.

Me: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a kid anymore, please adress me like an adult‚Äù

Mom: ‚ÄúOh your an adult when its convenient‚Äù.

I‚Äôd decided at that point I was already at the climax, there was no turning back. I had to tell her I was gay and get it over with because either way It looked like the course of my life just veered in an entirely different direction and I would have to move.

Me: ‚ÄúMom I‚Äôm gay‚Äù

My mom started crying hysterically screaming ‚Äòhow could you know you‚Äôve never been with a woman‚Äô and started asking all these ultra sexual questions about what I had or hadn‚Äôt done. I cut her off saying its not about the sexual act. Its about what I find attractive. I find men attractive. I told her she had to calm down or I couldn‚Äôt reason with her. She then looked at me dead in the eye and told me:

Mom: ‚ÄúI tried to raise you right. You arn‚Äôt my son. You need to move. Get out of my house. I disown you.‚Äù

This is what I had been anticipating. This was my greatest fear realized. All I had ever wanted was her love and acceptance. Instead I was being turned away. During all this time my Dad had remained silent. But now he took action. He started packing his things. She asked him why? What are you doing? He told her, if you are leaving him, I am leaving you the wedding is off. That man stood there and fought for me. He told me He knew I was loosing a second parent but that he would always be there for me. I love this man with all of my heart. He told my mom to fuck herself. This is when my mom finally got a dose of reality. She sat down and started being rational. I tried to reason with her through my own tears.

Me: ‚ÄúI have tried so hard to make you happy. I did all the right things. I didn‚Äôt date anyone in college or even hang out with friends EVER. I focussed on school. I graduated with top marks. I got a fulltime job at a great company thats given me so many opportunities. Im buying my own house. I‚Äôve never done any drugs and I don‚Äôt drink. I have tried SO HARD to be the best that I can be. But no matter what at the end of the day I‚Äôm gay. No matter how much I achieve, I am unacceptable. I didn‚Äôt even date anyone for the longest time because I‚Äôd rather stay in my room and be celibate than date someone and have to lie to you about it. I thought finally, buying my own house I‚Äôd be free. I‚Äôd be able to date someone. Don‚Äôt you know how bad I‚Äôve wanted to be able to introduce you to someone, anyone. And tell you, Mom, I‚Äôve met someone and they make me incredibly happy. I am incredibly scared and all I want is for you to love me, all of me. I can‚Äôt loose another parent. I already lost one. He walked away from me. Now you are disowning me.‚Äù

I broke down completely at that point and my dad took over trying to reason with her. She felt really bad. I could tell. She still asked me inappropriate questions about who I was with or doing but I kept cutting her off. Its not about that. This is a piece of who I am. It‚Äôs not the whole part. I‚Äôm still the hard working kid who graduated college got a fulltime job and is buying a house. But this IS a part of me. It isn‚Äôt going away. I want you to accept me.

She kept repeating how she felt and what she thought that I wasn‚Äôt really gay. That she wanted grand children. It was all about how this affected her. I finally got it through to her

Me: Mom, how do you know your not a lesbian? You‚Äôve never eaten pussy. You havn‚Äôt tried it so you can‚Äôt know. Do you see how ridiculous that logic is? It doesn‚Äôt make sense. I‚Äôm gay because men attract me. Women do not. I‚Äôm gay. I need you to accept this and me. I dont want to have kids though I may in the future.

She finally broke down at that point and told me she loved me. That she was just mad. and scared. Incredibly scared.

She hugged me and we both cried. She told me she wanted to meet whoever I was dating and that my privacy was my own if I didn‚Äôt want to share. Just not to lie about things anymore. I made it clear that meant if I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable telling her what was going on I would have to tell her it wasn‚Äôt her business. That my private life was my own, and called private for a reason.

We sort of all made up a bit after that. My Dad and Mom are still getting married I think. Alot of this is still down the road. My Mom asked what would I have done had I been disowned. I told her I‚Äôd already made arrangements if I had to with friends. I told her I‚Äôm not the first child to be disowned for being gay. There are other people who know and can sympathize and empathize for abandoned sons and daughters. She cried during dinner saying she felt ashamed for what she said and that I‚Äôd felt I had to line my ducks in a row so to speak the night before to make sure I had financial and emotional stability in place. She‚Äôs still looking off in the distance at nothing in particular. I‚Äôm worried still but everything is out in the open.

I apologize for this very long post. But I needed to write this down. This is an important step in my life.",,False,self,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_vlnud,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/vlnud/i_came_out/,

I really don't want to subscribe to, let alone moderate a place full of posts like that. I'd much rather moderate a place with 5-10 great posts everyday with comments filled with discussion.

That being said, I am going to remove all self-pic postings, random chat requests, advice about relationships (outside of Tuesdays), haircut reviews, and so forth. There are tons of subreddits on here to get advice, there are 1, maybe 2 places that are oriented so that a post can be about how much Gronkowski sucks (go Giants!) and I wish he'd suck...(wanky wanky) and we can have an actual conversation about both aspects.

Objectively I mean. Try to forget the beautiful love story you're living right now or the gorgeous dude you have your eyes on.

It's more about your family, your religious beliefs, your social environment, etc. 

Would things be easier? Would some people you care about be happier that way?


TL;DR: Being gay is great. But wouldn't life be easier if you were straight?
I personally don't know the answer right now.

Yeah, and, English isn't my mother tongue, so please be merciful.

While this was not necessarily that strange (you all are a bunch of achievers; I see you doing awesome things all the time), I did find it interesting that someone else was also moving across the country, to and from the same city as I was, and at almost exactly the same time.

We got to chatting, and that night alone, we sent a solid miniature novel back and forth via text message. We agreed to set up a time to meet for drinks and talk some more, but by the time the ""meet up"" came around, we were both well aware that it was more of a date than anything else.

We spent our date chatting and laughing for hours upon hours of time; it felt like we had known each other forever, and for me at least, the rest of the world disappeared that evening. He accompanied me back home for continued conversation, and we proceeded to share the night together.

We ended up spending the vast majority of the next five days together, after which I had to leave for an internship in Washington for ten weeks. On New Year's Eve, just five days after we had officially met in person, we decided to call ourselves exclusive. We managed through the ten weeks just fine, and he came out to visit, once to D.C., and we met again in NYC, two of the best experiences I've had.

Now, we're once again separated for a short while. He's completing Officer Development School at the current moment, and is for the most part deprived of any method of communication with the outside world, so it'll be a while before he sees this, I'm sure. I am extremely proud of him for pursuing his dream, and know that he'll be a Navy success story in a short amount of time. 

I apologize for the gushiness of this post, but I just wanted to thank you all, the members of this community, for existing. Without this subreddit, I would never have found the amazing man I did. We'd have been two different people with two completely different lives, with slim to no chances of ever meeting in person. I find myself more and more appreciative of the circumstances that brought us together with each passing day, and know that the future is much brighter, if only because he's in it. 

So again, thank you bros, and keep on doing what you do best! Cheers!",,False,self,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_1gwt3s,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1gwt3s/this_subreddit_has_given_me_the_best_gift_i_could/,

OK, so when I was a freshman in High School, I would get to hang out with a Senior that I thought was amazing. We'll call him ""Walt"". Exactly my type, smart, funny, masculine blah blah blah. I met him through my older brother, who was a Junior at the time. Walt didn't know I'm gay, I didn't know Walt is gay, my brother didn't know either of us are gay.  

We would all hang out during the year and into the summer. He went to college locally so he was still around for my High School years. When I graduated, I went to college in Pennsylvania and he got a job in Michigan. We chatted constantly on aim during my college years. 

I didn't come out to anyone until maybe Sophomore year of college and then, only to my close circle of friends. My fear of coming out caused me to have ZERO, that's right, ZERO sexual experiences in college. So my Senior year of college, I found out that my Freshman roommate, who happened to be from my town and is gay, had sex with Walt. And Walt likes to bottom. So me, having a crush on this dude for years and always wanting to fuck him, helped myself to some liquid courage and got on instant message. 

Basic conversation at first, yada yada and shit because im drunk and being stupid, when I finally just come right out with it. ""This might freak you out but I'm drunk and don't care right now, but I've had a crush on you since High School."" Note: the only reason I had the balls to do this was the knowledge that he had sex with a guy and the cheap vodka I was drinking. So anyway, he responded favorably. He said he had a little crush on me too. He was like, why do you think I always wanted to hang out, even without your brother. 

So I graduate from college and he gets a job offer in our hometown. He's somehow a balla and buys a big ass house. We text and he invites me over to come see it. Come over, get the tour and finish in his bedroom. After 8 years of being in the closet and liking each other, we finally had sex.  

We're not dating or anything, just a friends with benefits sort of deal. I'm not out to my parents yet and he's not out to anyone. Honestly, I'm OK with our arrangement right now. So happy though, really needed some good in my life right now. Thanks for listening guys. And I know I'm not the most articulate person but figured after lurking for so long, I needed to post my story.

(In a selfless way of course!)

I have known since I was super young that ladies were not floatin' my boat, but for some reason I just couldn't come to terms with that. I could only imagine myself being with a woman when I got older, and I wanted to have a family, blah, blah, yadda. I couldn't fathom the idea of being in a relationship with a guy. I almost wish I could say that the reason it took me so long to come out was due to my family being super unaccepting or whatever the case, but that's the total opposite. My mom is actually in a relationship with another woman, and my dad and stepmom are both exceptionally supportive even though they were all like ""what the crap? for real??"" haha. For some reason, I brought the acceptance problem upon myself. I couldn't come to terms with myself, because I thought in order to fit into society, or to be ""normal"" I had to be straight. Everybody looked down on homosexuality, but I knew that I would be cheating myself and some poor woman if I really tried to start a family with her.
(SORRY RANT)

I went to STL Pride with my mom and her partner because they asked me if I would come and support them, so of course I jumped on that opportunity. I was kinda nervous because I was still totally closeted to any and everyone, and had noooo idea what to expect. We got there, and I loved every minute of it. I just loved the environment, and the feeling that if I would have went in a tiny lil tutu and like a bra or whatever that people still would have been accepting. That was so different than any of my social circle/friend groups, and it blew my mind. My butt got smacked a couple of times while I was watching the parade, that was interesting haha and there was a guy in front of me who kept handing me beads, bracelets, etc and my mom keeps reminding me of the man crush he supposedly had on me.

Either way, it was just a ""long"" 20 year journey that took me to this point in my life. Now, I just need to freakin get involved with some gay people because i'm over these hateful people i'm hangin out with now! I wanna be myself, and not settle for anything less, and you guys have helped me realize that! 

Thanks, love you bros.

It's been requested that I provide a play-by-play thing; so here ya go. (No, I can't provide pics, because they're traceable and he's still heavily closeted) 

Meeting him (9pm) 

He's been messaging me on grindr for the past week, so after de-sketching myself, I decide to meet him at the rugby house (about 1km off campus). He's a massive guy, the plays flank in rugby. We come to his room, there's stuff everywhere but I dont give a fuck because he's too cute for me to care. 

We talk for a while, get to know each other and shit. ...and then shit happens. 

~Midnight = Sexytimes (Dolan face goes here)

He just grabs me out of nowhere, but I don't care because I've wanted to do that to him but haven't been able to work up the courage to do that. After like 3 minutes of us making out hard, we go up to his room; and he tells me he's fucked guys before but he hasn't been fucked before and wants to try it. So he comes back from the shower, obviously really nervous because he's still fucking awkward about this. I kiss him and tell him everything is fine and that I don't care if he messes up. 

He lays on his bed and tells me to fuck him (seriously, actual words), so I do. I get like 2 minutes into it before a draft causes him to shiver and his elbow hits me in the nose, I don't realise it's bleeding until the blood drips onto him. I pull out quickly, foolishly realising I don't have a condom on, and run to the bathroom and shove tissues up my nose because fuck I'm not missing this. I take a condom out of his drawer, and put it on, and start to fuck him again. He's really vocal about this shit, he's moaning and just like ""fuck me"" the entire time. I don't know what to do because I'm worried he's gonna wake the whole house. 

I shoot, and he just says ""babe, you did use a condom right?"" I tell him that I did and that he doesn't need to worry about anything. He hugs me and we cuddle until we fall asleep

Waking up + Walk of shame (~9:15am Next Morning) 

He's still asleep because he doesn't have class today, I look at the clock and realise I have 2 minutes to get to my psych lecture. I put my clothes on (from last night), I haven't showered or anything, and bolt it to the science building all across campus. I get to the lecture hall and everyone just stares. I come back to my dorm after my psych lecture, and he's standing by my dorm door, I immediately think ""Oh shit, I'm gonna get my ass kicked"". He kisses me and just says ""thanks for last night, I really needed that"", and just walks away.

So, after being really curious - and afraid - to try this for awhile, I finally managed to try out the real thing yesterday. I've gotten comfortable with fingering myself over the past few weeks, so I was sure to loosen myself up before we began. He put on a condom and plenty of silicone-based lube. We went at it in the missionary position, and he was very slow to push it in. He made sure I could control how far he went in, so I wouldn't be taking too much before I was ready. Once he was a comfortable depth inside (maybe 3-4 inches?) and I felt relaxed enough, I told him to s-l-o-w-l-y start thrusting. 

Ho. Ly. Shit. It was instantly the most pleasurable thing i've ever felt in my life. 

It seemed like he was hitting every sensitive spot in me when he'd push in, and then he'd be hitting them all over again when he'd pull back again. After about a minute, he laid down on top of me with his forearms supporting his weight, and began getting a little more into it. I wrapped my legs around his lower back, and we kissed each other's neck. I ran my hands up-and-down his arms,  all over his chest and played with the hair on the back of his head. . .I just couldn't believe how extremely intimate and blissful the whole experience was. When it was time, he pulled out, took off the condom and shot on my stomach like a porn star. I wasn't stroking myself during the act, but I laughed because it seemed like I had barely even had the chance to stroke myself before I was cumming, too. 


So, overall it was a mind-blowing experience. Now I think i'm a bottom, but don't tell anyone, okay? :p

A little back-story:  I was raised in a very religious home, and a very insular religious community; my parents and all of my siblings are still very religiously observant.  I've actually never explicitly come out to my siblings, though that's in part because I've assumed they have figured it out.  As a result, I didn't really start coming out until partway through college.  Fortunately, my friends are awesome and have all been incredibly supportive, even the ones I was a little nervous about.  Before I was completely out in the frat, some of my bros would cover for me hardcore when I was hooking up with a guy.  Even so, I've never really brought around guys I've dated, not because I don't think they'd be cool with it, but internally for whatever silly reason I thought it might be awkward.

Anyway.  A couple weeks ago a large group of us are out at a club and I'm talking with a guy who it turns out was hitting on me, and we ended up dancing for a bit just for fun.  After we parted ways, no fewer than 5 of my straightbro friends came up to me and were like ""that's the first time you've ever done anything gay around us, that seriously made every one of us so happy that you're comfortable being completely yourself around us. We want nothing more than for you to be happy.""  Then a few nights ago night we're out and a couple of them team up on me and ask when I'm bringing a boyfriend around.

Also, I go over to my brother and sister-in-law's place fairly frequently for meals and to see my niece.  Last week I get a text inviting me over for a lunch, and my brother throws in ""by the way, if there's anyone you want to bring, feel free to bring him along just let us know so we have enough food and table settings.  Consider that a +1 invite for any time you come over.""

All of this in the span of a couple weeks has seriously  made me so much more grateful than I already was (and I've always been extremely grateful for how awesome my friends are) about the people I have in my life.  Now I'm even feeling a little guilty for giving them the feeling that I wasn't comfortable being myself around them. 

**TL;DR:** My friends and family care more about my happiness and being comfortable around them than I ever imagined.",,False,self,t5_2tdzg,False,,,True,t3_1jawjx,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1jawjx/perhaps_i_have_been_underestimating_the_people_in/,

After a lot of questions, I thought I would do a mini-AMA. Feel free to ask me anything and I will answer when I have the time. I will provide a pic of my test results, as I still have them after I get home from work. I have been positive since 2004 and am undetectable and in the best shape of my life!

EDIT: I am trying to finish up some work, but keep the questions coming and I will respond to each one after work!

EDIT: Okay, here is the proof I said I would send. This is my positive test result from Sept 2004: http://i.imgur.com/JGJG9.jpg

EDIT: One of the discussions reminded me of a Swiss study that was very interesting. As you know, literature in the United States about sex in general is pretty f-ed up. European countries are usually very progressive about things and while the study observed straight couples, it definitely is an interesting way to look at things. I present to you the study in its entirety: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=8035

UPDATE: Okay, so a lot of people have been calling me brave, which I don't think is the case at all because I'm doing this all anonymous-ish. I tried to answer every question that was asked honestly and the best way I can. I am heading to bed tonight, but will answer questions as long as they come in.
BTW, whomever gifted me 2 years or Reddit Gold and sent me the very kind letter. Thank you for the words and the gift!

UPDATE: I hope that at least one person learns something from this. That was my goal. Anyway, some takeaways that I have established: there is nothing wrong with sex. People, especially in the U.S. are very caught up on facts like number of sexual partners, ""sluts"", etc. If you are more open about sex and your sexuality, then you would be more comfortable talking about HIV. There is no shame in the game, guys. Just like it only takes once to get pregnant, it just takes once to become HIV+. Protect yourself but enjoy your life also. Most importantly, the original intent of this AMA, is ask questions, get knowledgeable and informed and challenge things when people say things that don't make sense.

Hey guys! So at roughly 10:00 AM today, I got up in front of my class 
and delivered my coming out speech! I kept telling myself to take deep 
breaths and everything would be okay. I got up in front of the class, 
making jokes to relieve the tension (and de-stress myself). Once I 
started reading I couldn't stop! I could feel the weight being lifted off 
as each sentence was said! As I looked around the room, almost 
everyone looked happy for me. I even made one girls cry! 
My best friend didn't make a big deal about it. However, a girl I dated 
in 9th grade (now a close friend) didn't seem to want to make eye contact 
with me. I did catch her glance once and she looked like she wanted to 
kill me...But, everyone else didn't care!!! I cannot tell you all how happy I am! 
After I sat back down we all struck up a conversation about breakfast (I had 
toast and honey by the way), which showed that everything would be
okay! Now I'm just going to play the waiting game until everyone 
knows. Thanks for the support, everyone!!!!

Skip to earlier today, they were driving me to the airport of course saying something. My dad says something along the lines of ""...like a fucking faggot"" right as were pulling up to the terminal. I snapped, opened the door, yelled as loud as I could ""I'M GAY"", got out and walked away. 

12 hours later no communication. Sorry just needed to vent.

Thank for the replies guys. Still Haven't talked to them, nor have they tried either. It's really not driving me crazy since im used to not talking to them for a few weeks at a time.

I'm not like typical straight guys, but I don't think it would be easy for people to tell I was gay unless I told them explicitly. Half of my friends are straight men, and of course when we're together we generally do straight guys' activities (so many activities!) Long and short, I'm a gaybro - at least half of the time.

Recently, I moved to a smaller city to start professional school. In this new city, I hadn't experienced anything too different, outside of noticing people said 'that's gay' more frequently. My boyfriend still lives in the other city but we see each other every other weekend more-or-less. We were walking home together one night, holding hands, when a car full of guys slowed down to scream 'fags, etc' at us. We didn't know if they were just going to yell or if they had the intention of following us or hurting us.

For me, this is the first time that I had *really* felt discrimination and been threatened by it. In every other situation I could have concealed my sexuality, but it had been safe for me to be gay.  The next week, I was angry, confused, sad - I felt like I couldn't trust anyone in my city. I spent a long time thinking about the social contract and how things like this happen in different places around the world.

What I think I realized most profoundly, though, was that I may have been privileged to be a gaybro. Between 14 and 25, my whole *career* as a gay guy, I had never felt danger as a gay guy, I had lived my life never worrying for my safety or my space in society - I always felt like I  was respected and protected as a person. 

Many, MANY people around the world, and in my own community, never had this privilege. They don't have anything in common with straight men, maybe they have 'gay face' or 'gay voice' or 'gay hair' that signals their sexuality. Maybe they express their sexuality differently. These people must have faced so much more discrimination than I have, been boxed into more corners and had more prejudice held against them because they couldn't pass in conversation or on the street, as heteronormative.

I read a post on /r/gaybros a while ago: ""gaybros are not gay"". Lots of people didn't like this article. For me, it's not that gaybros aren't gay, but perhaps they're able to escape or avoid discrimination and disrespect - or - are given extra respect because they're gay ""but not THAT gay""

I'm sharing this story humbly. I would love to hear what you guys think about it. Thanks for reading.

**TLDR:** I'm a gaybro, recently was discriminated against/threatened for holding hands in a new city, lost a bit of faith, now wonder if I've ever felt the same discrimination other LGBT have endured all their lives.

Spring has sprung. Temperatures are rising. Birds are in the air, I can see little shoots of green poking out from the ground. It's here. A time for new beginnings, and that's just what we need: a fresh start.

It's been an exciting few months. We're seeing more meetups than ever before in Gaybros history. We've had some incredible AMAs from people such as Rep. Brian Sims and Adam Goldman of The Outs (have you caught episode 7 yet?). We raised well over $5,000 for The Trevor Project, a great cause. We've also been asking a lot of questions about who we are and what is our purpose. As we grow, we've garnered attention from a variety of outside sources - and sometimes in their haste they have missed the mark. But! Now that Spring is here I think it is time to get things back on track. Let's put aside the meta monologues about identity and privilege, the open letters to our critics, the debates about who belongs here and who doesn't. The best thing for us to do - is to do what we do best. Let's get back to talking about the things that brought us here in the first place. 

Today we launched an all new, cleaner layout. We hope you like it, because we sure do. It's clean and easy to read, and adds a bit of color. Additionally, we are going to be taking a fresh look at the theme days. Some people have expressed their dislike for the theme days and let me just say: that's fine. The theme days are there as guidelines. They are prompts, and act as a reminder of the type of stuff we like to talk about. If you don't want to talk about working out on a Wednesday, that's okay. We won't remove ‚Äúoff-theme‚Äù posts unless they are explicitly against the rules. If you want to talk about another subject other than the day's theme, that's fine too. The themes are just there to suggest a good conversation starter in hopes that we get one less 'hot dude' pic or meme. Within the next day or two we will put a link on the header with a poll where you can vote for our new theme days. The top 7 will win.

New celebrity AMAs are in the works as well as contests with cool prizes (we have a LOT of Reddit Gold to give out). I have no doubt that we'll continue to see the number and frequency of meetups grow, and as the weather gets nicer we might even be able to get outside for some of them. With Spring here, Summer is only just around the corner and you now what that means? Guys. In. Shorts. Weather. We really have a LOT to look forward to, guys. 

So, here's our request: let's remember what we do best: sharing with each other the stuff that we like, interests that we've found don't tend to get as much focus in other online gay communities. Let's continue building our brotherhood by sharing in our triumphs and our struggles. Let's continue to host amazing meet ups. Let's keep supporting awesome causes, and most importantly let's keep being fucking awesome.

DISCLAIMER: not all young people need this, many have good heads on their shoulders -this is for the rest of you. 

the online hookup ten commandments

**1) thou shalt not trust men**

   Tonight, a 21yo stone cold fucking hottie on craigslist begs for bareback, asks that potential unknown stranger partner(s) be ""DDF."" Boys, you might have heard this from some girls you've met; men lie. Oh they don't lie all the time -if you ask em if they're hungry they'll probably say yes and mean it. But when it comes to deciding what to say so they can get their rocks off, their CPU usually selects, ""whatever he wants to hear,"" as the reply option.
  

**2) If you host, take precautions.**

Ideally, you'll meet at a neutral public place, get to know each other and then decide if you want him to have access to your home but some guys forego this formality and just give them their address and, to quote the Bard, say, 'come over, lets bust a nut."" ok, I'm a guy too, I know how it can be, especially when the other guy is giving you a brief window of opportunity. BUT -take *some* precautions. Live in a condo or apt? Give him your address and leave off the apt number. When he actually arrives and texts you with something witty like, ""yo, I'm here,"" go down and check him out before inviting him in. This gives you a chance to stroll right on by should he look like whitney houston on a binge. You never know who you're meeting; for all you know its a fox-news nutcase looking to kill gays. -be safe.

**3) If he isn't showing you a pic, you shouldn't meet.**

""Oh but I'm so sick of superficiality -people should just meet and go from there."" This is code for several possible things; ""I'm so hideous my cat tried to bury my face in litter,"" ""Face? Well, what's left after that horrific fire,"" or, ""no its not a picasso, that's a photo."" But yes, some of us *aren't* superficial. Sure, I like a masculine stud god whose feet I can grovel at and kiss, but you know what, some of the most awesome guys I've known have just been average joes. AND I STILL ASK FOR A FACE PIC. How do I know he isn't all nutso with that Charles Manson googley-eyed stare? And even if not, don't I deserve the option to see who I am talking to and make my own decision? More often than not, if he refuses to show you, he has something to hide.

**4) straight guys usually arent straight**

   Oh believe me, that big guy with fists of stone who tells you he's straight probably is and if you suspect he isnt you ought to first invest in a steel jaw before making arm-flailing accusations. But when you're on craigslist et. al. and see ""straight guy looking for his first time"" you *should* read, ""If I say Im straight you'll want me more"" OR the ever popular ""I do have a wife, she just doesnt know I suck dick."" Now there's not much danger here, but at least don't think, ""wow, he's totally straight! AND HE'S SUCKING MY DICK!"" He could be a gaybro, but the odds are this is his 214th first time.

**5) Assume everyone has a disease until you know for a fact they don't**

   While this definitely touches on the first commandment, it does deserve its own special category. The first thing you're taught about safe sex should be this. ""DDF"" doesnt cut it nor does some dogeared card from their wallet declaring their body as a disease-free zone. the bottom line is YOU DON'T KNOW. So act like they do. Wear a condom, don't do dumb shit, and don't expect some pill to fix you the next day -sometimes they don't.


**6) He'll probably never come back**

   It was the best sex you ever had. He was a stone cold hottie. You had chemistry, fire and he seemed so awesome. You asked if he'd like to come back for more another night and he beamed you a killer smile and said, ""hell yeah, bro, I'd actually like to make a regular night to do this."" HE'S NEVER COMING BACK. In addition to being liars, men are also often cowards. Apparently saying, ""thanks man and it was totally awesome but I usually don't do repeat performance; its not my thing"" is akin to saying, ""here's my wallet and credit cards and my pin number is 1337."" (right now all of /r gaymers is changing their pin numbers). 

**7) He won't leave his wife for you**

   This is also on the Ten Commandments of Dating Men: for Women, right under ""3) Yes he CAN fake his orgasms: don't believe him when he says his semen smells like your vanilla hand lotion because you made him that awesome sundae before bed."" When you see, ""MWM seeks gaybro to swallow a hard day's load, must be on the DL -discreet only!"" do not, at any point, allow a cartoon thought bubble to materialize over your head with pictures of him showing up at the last moment in a limo unless he's a wedding planner. If you want an LTR, move on. If you want a really hot one-time encounter with a guy who hasn't been permitted to blow a load in a month, he's yer guy.

**8) Safe Sex can be HOT sex**

   So, you only fuck and suck? Well, aren't you just the Rembrandt of the bedroom! Get creative. hell, get downright kinky. In college, (back when I rode my dinosaur to class), we had a safe sex seminar that taught us the golden rule: on me, not in me. I can't help you if you think the only way you can be satisfied is to bareback with a total stranger. Nothing fixes stupid. But if you don't think that watching a hot gaybro standing over you, edging his cock until he blows a load all over your face isn't hot, then I'm not coming over no matter how many times you beg! ...You didn't beg? SHIT. Seriously, the only limits are your imagination and you only get one life. Try not to fuck it up for one night of perspiration.

**9) Wear a fucking condom**

   This should speak for itself, and moreso, shouldn't even require saying, but just to be really, really clear; WEAR A FUCKING CONDOM. Aids isnt gone, other STDs completely suck, and men lie and are cowards (you may have heard that somewhere). I don't know you -and I *still* don't want you to die. WEAR A FUCKING CONDOM.

**10) There's a sliver's chance he will be the one**

   Sounds crazy but he could be. We don't enjoy the luxury of being the majority. Straight people are everywhere. Believe me, even my fucking parents are straight! They get to meet and fall in love at any grocery store, movie theater, bar and grill, shopping mall.. and we get 5 bars on one street and some net apps. You'll more often meet the perfect guy... who lives in a foreign country. There's plenty of us, but we're all spread out; there just arent as many of us in your hometown as one would need to sift through to find 'the one.' But you know what, he could be there, so what the fuck -try. I met a guy on craigslist and we ended up falling in love and being together for nearly a year. Alas, he wasn't the one; we broke up a week ago (and that's ok, we're best friends and still have sex so all's well that ends well. of course, if any of your hot young gaybros want a lightly used 42yo kinky bear to... they don't? No.. of course they don't. Fine, shut up, I didn't want a date anyway!) But you know what, he's now my best friend (with bennies) and I'm so glad I met that hot 23yo stud boy who (shut up, they still won't date you)... anyway, nothing ventured --nothing gained.

TLDR: be safe, dont trust strangers, have realistic expecations, fuck like bunnies but wear a fucking condom, and who knows, maybe he's out there. Oh, and Im single.

Most of the time gay guys get confused and ask me if I'm gay, I'm a metalhead and I always wear bands t-shirts and things like that, I'm not trying to act straight, I'm just me all the time, but people always think I'm straight for some reason, never had problems with that though, it's usually a compliment when they say I look masculine, I have flamboyant friends though and I don't really have problems with that, in fact I always say I'm gay if someone asks me.

Well uh, a big production company here is working on the local version of a famous gay show from the United States, and hired me as as producer, good salary, being, for the first time a producer of a tv show seemed like a good thing to me, I met the whole team except the director and the ""hosts"" of the show that are actually driving the whole thing, but everyone seemed to like me, I've worked on similar things before so I knew some people.

In this show, 5 gay guys work on the decoration of a house, you might know what show it is, well today I went to meet the director and the hosts, obviously they were all flamboyant, it's ok, I was kind, talked with them about what we were gonna do, they told me the kind of places they wanted to visit, what did they want for the local version, we had a good chat, they never asked if I was gay, I just assumed it wasn't important, I never say something like HEY IM GAY, I just say yes if someone asks.


I get home, and I get a call from the director's secretary:

""Well I'm calling you because the team decided to hire another producer and we won't need you anymore.""

""Why?"" I asked

""They say they're looking for someone that's able to connect with them, you know, someone... like.. gay.""

YES, I got fired because they thought I'm not gay.
Can you believe that?, I got discriminated by own ""kind"", ha.

Yeah I'm gonna sue and everything, I still have my current job so it's ok, I can get another one too, no big deal.

1343657788.0,195,self.gaybros,xe3re,A Hot Weekend with a Little Something Extra,iamelben,231,36,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/xe3re/a_hot_weekend_with_a_little_something_extra/,"Bros, I apologize in advance for the length of this post, but I‚Äôm still trying to put my thoughts together coherently.  I guess the best way I know how to explain where I‚Äôm a right now is an exultant feeling of victory, and somehow‚Ä¶vindication.  I guess I should start at the beginning.

This weekend, I drove the many, many miles to spend the weekend with my parents, who are starting to get a little older (I‚Äôm the youngest of eight kids, and my parents had me when they were in their forties).  It always brightens them up when I come visit, enough to where we‚Äôre all willing to ignore the elephant in the room of me being gay.  So, it‚Äôs a compromise.  They deal with having a gay son, and I deal with the incredibly oppressive rural South Georgia atmosphere, and some pretty shitty memories of growing up in the closet here.

I won‚Äôt go into to detail, but here‚Äôs the Reader‚Äôs Digest condensed version: I was short, fat, ugly (I thought), and in possession of ZERO self-confidence.  

I came to my parents house this weekend after having a somewhat busy, frustrating week. To further complicate matters, I was on sort of a dry spell, sex-wise.  So, I was horny.  And cranky.  My parents, being the loveable old farts they are, went to bed promptly at 8 o‚Äôclock (years of habit being on a farm and getting up before the sun), leaving me to my own devices.  

Well, bros, I was horny.  Very horny.  I‚Äôm talking ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt fuck something soon, I‚Äôm going to punch the next person I see in the face‚Äù kind of horny.  So, I did what any red-blooded gaybro in a pinch would‚Ä¶I downloaded Grindr.  Now bros, some of you who may know me know that the past couple of years have been sort of a second puberty for me.  I‚Äôve lost 50 pounds, acquired a little muscle, picked up some self-confidence, and have shed a bit of my social awkwardness.

In my past experiences with Grindr and other apps in my medium-sized, very fitness-conscious city, I've felt my body to be a work in progress, and that I was shaping up to be a solid 6, or even 7 on a good day.  In my tiny south Georgia hometown, though, I was transformed into some sort of god.  I was LITERALLY getting a message on Grindr every couple of minutes.  An endless, never-ending sea of ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHey‚Äù flooded my inboxes, and I‚Äôm not gonna lie bros, it felt really good.

Then, something weird happened.  I got a message from someone who looked familiar.  After swapping a few pics, I realized that I recognized him as‚Ä¶wait for it‚Ä¶ONE OF MY VERY FIRST HIGH SCHOOL CRUSHES.  I‚Äôve had fantasies about this guy for YEARS.  He was a senior when I was a freshman, a baseball star, and a total bro.  He‚Äôd put on probably 10 or 15 pounds since high school, but was still fucking HOT.  Here‚Äôs the kicker: he had no idea who I was.  Didn‚Äôt recognize me at all.  How could he?

So, bros, I went over to his house, and trust me when I say that we had the hottest, nastiest, sweatiest, man-sex I have EVER had in my life.  He came hands-free, and I  came harder than I‚Äôve ever come in my life.  I literally saw stars.  Bros, I have never been more thankful for the de-sensitizing effects of condoms, because I‚Äôm sure I would have cummed immediately upon pushing into that ass without a barrier.  It was that hot.

We just sort of lay there for a little bit afterward, catching our breath, then suddenly out of nowhere, he sits straight up in bed, and is like‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHoly shit, you‚Äôre Amanda‚Äôs little brother!‚Äù

I laughed and told him I was, and he just sort of laid there in shock for a little bit, and then he looked at me and said

‚ÄúGod DAMN son, you grew up good.‚Äù

I laughed, but that pricked something in me, bros.  Deep.  We showered together after, which was hot, and then we made plans to meet up again, but I couldn‚Äôt help feeling this deep sense of‚Ä¶I dunno, vindication.  You know?  It was like the final nail had been driven into the coffin of who I used to be.

Also, and you can take this with however many grains of salt as you deem appropriate, but including this hot bro, I have been hit up by no less than THREE former classmates on Grindr, one of which used to call me a faggot all the time.

I‚Äôm not sure guys, but I feel as though I should have some kind of medal for this.

TL;DR- Fucked one of my first gay crushes.  Also, got hit on by a few former classmates on Grindr, including a former bully.

P.S.  He asked me back to his house the next day, and I fucked him again.  :D
