I buy a lot of games and I like a lot of games.  When investigating a game i need to know what's going to piss me off.  I care a lot more about the people who *don't* like the game in question than those who *do* like a game.  Several times i've noticed that people who dissapprove get downvoted, even though they state well argued reasons not to approach a specific title.  Anyway, this is a great sub-reddit and I really enjoy everyones opinion and some of the fun discussion on various games.

The summer sale has started! And to start it of on this subreddit I decided to once again make a post that will list all the current and ended sales. Last winter sale didn't go so well for me on that part as I was quite busy and missed out on a few flash/daily sales near the end. This time I will try to keep updated with the sales

What is this thread for? You might ask. Well, I will not only list (hopefully) all the games here, I will also put a link or two to a SIB thread of that game so you can get a solid opinion before you ask the question yourself on this sub. If you still aren't sure if you want to buy the game or not, go ahead and make a thread, but try not to repost and make sure to say why the previous threads didn't help you out (e.g., they didn't state if it was for kids only)

With that said, enjoy, **and make sure to wait until the last day before you buy a game, it is likely to go down some more on top of the standard sale it already has.** If it wasn't a daily sale or flash sale at the end of the sale, you can safely buy it :D. Make sure to check out /r/gamedeals and /r/patientgamers to make sure that steam is cheaper than other sites.

Because of their re-branding as Infestation this score will not appear on the Steam store page.

It's infamous for, on launch, listing features that are not in the game yet on the Steam page which led to them being pulled due to false advertising. One of the developers also started banning people from the forums for saying anything negative about it.

Why Valve even put this on the main page is beyond me. 

Here is [TotalBiscuit's video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtKAm3nzg6I).",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,,True,t3_1ikl7y,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1ikl7y/ysnb_infestation_survivor_stories/,

Coming here and asking about games I got very clear answers. And I was able to avoid games that didn't fit my style. I just want to thank everyone for their input. I think this is a great community that more people should take advantage of. Thanks again, and I'm sure I'll be back for advice later.

You can spend as little or as much as you want and decide who gets what.  Give your money to charity, developers or both.  In exchange you will receive your games, and digital soundtracks for some games as well. If you pay more than the average you will also receive an additional game. All games in this bundle will also come with Steam keys.  With the option to pay whatever price you wish, this bundle is an absolute steal.

**Get it [here](http://www.humblebundle.com/)**

Note: In previous bundles if you paid more than the average, you would be eligible to receive any additional games that later became unlocked as the days went by.  It's unclear if this bundle will get games added so it's your judgment call.
Included in this bundle are 

 * **Darksiders**
 * **Metro 2033**
 * **Red Faction Armageddon** (DLC added 12/7)
 * **Company of Heroes**
 * **Company of Heroes Opposing Fronts**

-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Darksiders**

An action adventure platformer.  You play as the character WAR, one of the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse bent on restoring order to the realm of man.  Gameplay wise it's a cross between Zelda and the God of War.  You'll have your fair share of combat, and simple puzzles.  You can execute finishing moves, gain new weapons and some abilities as well.  The story is interesting and overall the game should be an enjoyable experience for most.

**Metro 2033**

A post apacolyptic survival game in which you must travel and survive a reimagined Russia.  Based on a the novel of the same name, this game was well regarded for it's graphics and atmosphere when it was released and both still hold up well even now.  The game itself is a highly immersive first person shooter with a focus on survival and horror elements.  You won't see any bright colored menus or health meters.  All information is communicated naturally through your game experience.  Sound is also excellent and a large factor in your survival.  This also isn't a run and gun shooter and you will have to conserve your ammo and use health kits to patch yourself up.  If you enjoy survivalist type games like STALKER, you will enjoy this.

**Red Faction Armageddon**

The latest game in the Red Faction Series, this game continues the 3rd person perspective from Red Faction Guerrilla.  However, unlike the open world sandbox in Guerrilla, Armageddon is more linear.  The Red Faction games are known for the destructibility of their environments and Armageddon is no different.  You will get a number of weapons you can use to wreak havoc on your surroundings.  The Magnet gun is worth mentioning which allows you to pull surfaces apart by anchoring one surface to another and you also get a repair tool which can be used to fix certain damaged structures.  The story isn't entirely memorable as once again you play a member of the resistance against Mars authorities, however the gameplay is solid and once again you will get most of you fun blowing things up. 

**Company of Heroes / Opposing Fronts / Tales of Valor**

I have written an in depth review about the original which can be read [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/10y7vv/sib_company_of_heroes/).  In short, this is an excellent WWII RTS game.  The gameplay is fairly realistic and the sound is excellent.  Casualties will be felt, and victory will be sweet. Graphically, although the game was released under Directx9, Directx10 has since been added.  Additionally, the online community remains active.  Unfortunately I have not played the expansions but if they are anything like the original, they would be worth buying.

**Saints Row: The Third**

What began as a competitor to the GTA series has now evolved into a game with it's own identity.  This is an open sandbox game for people with a sense of humor who don't take themselves too seriously.  Want to beat someone down with a sex toy or shoot yourself out of a cannon? do it here.  There is also a decent co-operative multiplayer and modders have added many more options to gameplay.  The game is well worth it alone, but as a bonus game in a bundle the game is also a steal. (Note you must pay above the average to receive this game).

There you have it.  You can always check previous posts on all of the above games but in short this bundle is a VERY good value and shouldn't be passed up.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT: For those who might already have the games, I just want to add that THQ as a company has been in financial trouble lately.  They took a gamble on the uDraw tablet for the Wii and lost 100 Million on it.  They also faced delisting on the stock exchange and were forced to do a reverse stock split to keep shares above $1.00.

Of course THQ is also responsible for the situation they're in as they took a risk and lost, but regardless as a gamer I'd be disappointed to see the death of an otherwise decent company and loss of some of their upcoming games. On the horizon we have **Metro: Last Light** and **South Park: The Stick of Truth**. Personally I'd also like to see the stories of all 4 horsemen of the **Darksiders** series finished.  So if you want to support THQ, consider buying the bundle or possibly gifting games to your friends to just get their name out there. You can still donate all your proceeds to charity.

Disclaimer: I own exactly 10 shares of THQ stock which I bought for fun recently and as a show of support. ",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,1355338445.0,,trophy,True,t3_140caa,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/140caa/ysb_humble_thq_bundle/,

1342772019.0,149,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,wv4vw,[SUGGESTION] Some guidelines for a better subreddit!,Caeg,169,20,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/wv4vw/suggestion_some_guidelines_for_a_better_subreddit/,"I already messaged the mods about this, but I thought we should see just how much agreement we have with the general public at the same time.

So if you agree with any of this, please UPVOTE it to gather more attention!  I don't get any karma for this anyway.

Well then! I think we can all agree that while this subreddit has a true potential to be terrific, it does need a few more pointers before it can really shine.

As it stands right now, most posts I see are completely pointless and predictable (""SIB: HL2 for 90% off???"" etc.), repetitive (countless ""SIB Max Payne 3??"" as soon as the last one leaves the front page), many downvoted naysayers who don't happen to agree with the circlejerk (there was already a very important post about it the other day), and otherwise pointless comments (completely non-informative and oversimplified recommendations, as in people saying ""A MILLION TIMES YES,"" ""I really can't recommend this game enough,"" ""best game ever, get it ASAP"" etc.)

These posts threaten to make this subreddit completely useless and unnecessary! This could be a place where you can hear about the personal experience of fellow players with similar tastes to get as personalized a recommendation as you can. If we're just looking for a simple ""yes/no"" we could just look up some 'professional' reviews or hit Megacritic. We don't need a subreddit for that!

So here's my suggestions for some simple guidelines:

* At some point in your comment/recommendation, add a 'similar games' reference, as in **""if you enjoyed Portal but want some more action in it, you should buy Prey""** or **""YSB UT3 if you liked UT2K4 or Quake, but don't expect it to feel like Gears of War""**. Make it clear, concise, and have it stand out easily in your comment. This should be, at the very least, the TL;DR version of every post! (personally this is what I miss the most in professional game reviews!)

* As a general guideline, in order to help potential recommendations, the OP should also state clearly and concisely either what he's looking for/expecting to have in the game (**""SIB Dragon Age if I'm looking for some mindless loot-hunting fun and don't care about story or plot?""**) or AT LEAST mention previous games the OP likes (**""I play Skyrim, Bioshock, and Fallout for the story and atmosphere. SIB Mass Effect?""**). This will help other people get a better perspective of OP's tastes and thus give better recommendations!

* In comments, it should be encouraged to add personal stories from a game (think about all those Day-Z stories, you know the ones I'm talking about!). **Your recommendation or review of a game should include YOUR EXPERIENCE from it.** This should be emphasized in the sidebar!

* One of the key purposes of this subreddit is to gather, over time, a general 'reddit consensus' about a game's worth. In order to help this and make it easier to look up, I suggest we periodically add a general thread for specific games (at least ones that get plenty of reposts, like Max Payne 3). In this thread we can post links to the separate threads, and maybe quote the top comments off them. People can post general review posts without it cluttering the subreddit.

* In addition, I suggest a general link-portal thread where we post links to these game-specific threads and maybe quote a general 'verdict' for each one. We should periodically update this thread to add some new releases that get plenty of attention, and probably link it in the sidebar, too. This and the previous point will make it much easier to quickly look up and find a general consensus over a game!

* IF we do post a 'verdict' for a game, **we should of course quote the top-voted positive AND negative comments of a game (disregarding obvious trolls and/or circlejerks).**

* Generic, predictable threads i.e ""SIB the entire Half Life series as I've never played it and it's 75% off??"" should be strongly discouraged as a general rule, and this should be highlighted in the sidebar - we don't need these posts as they just demand circlejerk. However such posts should be allowed in the condition that they add something specific and personal that might be relevant, for instance ""SIB the Half Life series **even if I don't really enjoy FPS's / only enjoy cover systems in shooters / care a lot about story in games, how good is the plot?**"", or ""**I have a relatively old system but I can run Bioshock on low settings, will I still enjoy it even with shadows off?**"" - some of these subjects are still borderline irrelevant, but I feel they are the bare minimum one should expect to see.

* Obviously, downvoting comments that don't align with the circlejerk or 'consensus' should be strongly discouraged and emphasized in the sidebar!

This really is a great and very useful subreddit, but I think that with these guidelines it can really be a fantastic place to get personal recommendations and general discussions about the merits of specific games!

Do not downvote dissenting opinions of a game. If you loathe Diablo 3, you should not downvote people who enjoyed the game. If you loved Call of Duty, you should not downvote people who tried it and hated it.

This subreddit succeeds based on a mix of opinions. People who submit a post should receive a variety of responses and not one unified bandwagon view. I've been seeing more and more posts in this subreddit downvoted to obscurity when they have legitimate views on why a game should/should not be purchased.

Remember, use the downvote only if the comment is flaming another user, has nothing to do with the  game in question, or violates one of the subreddit rules.

Do NOT downvote post like these (actual posts that were downvoted below a 1 vote threshold)

* In a word, YES! It's a load of fun. Mind you, it's not perfect, but it's a blast to play, despite a little bit of a learning curve for the nuances of the game.
* Battlefield 3 is really great, but don't buy it full price. Wait until you can pick up the base game + premium for fairly cheap. I say this because the player count will drop hard when the 4th game comes out soon. There will still be a sizeable player count however, so it is still worth picking up for cheap.
Most of Reddit will disagree, but Black Ops 2 is the best CoD since 4, in all manner of areas. It still has a boat load of very cheap elements like scorestreaks and lag compensation, but it is a great pick up and play shooter, with a lot of depth hidden beneath the surface.

1363734481.0,130,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,1amjdr,YSB: Bastion,Silvanus350,145,15,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1amjdr/ysb_bastion/,"For those who haven't yet heard, or are still undecided, you should definitely purchase [Bastion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/) if you're looking for a new game.  Bastion is a small hack n' slash RPG developed by [Supergiant Games](http://supergiantgames.com/) with *extremely* high production values.  The game is dripping with style, and excels in every aspect of its implementation.  Consider:

* **Beautiful Visuals:** The game is very [lush](http://supergiantgames.com/site/wp-content/uploads/Bastion_PC_0004.jpg), with [vibrant colors](http://supergiantgames.com/site/wp-content/uploads/Bastion_E32011_0004.jpg) and [varied environments](http://supergiantgames.com/site/wp-content/uploads/Bastion_E32011_0003.jpg). You never feel that your surroundings are monotonous or repetitive.

* **Incredible Audio:** Bastion has a [fantastic soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mDWzu5yxLg&amp;list=PL1A3044EBC796E3DC), strong enough to stand apart from the game. The music ranges from fast and furious to [slow and contemplative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cELTdtw6U&amp;list=PL1A3044EBC796E3DC).  It ties the game together without taking your focus off the gameplay!

* **Dynamic Narration:** Supergiant's [official trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mX48y24t9iU) should give some small glimpse of this charming (and somewhat campy) narrator. He tells the story of Bastion, from beginning to end, including every action you undertake! Whether you smash monsters, fall off the stage, or fall down in defeat, the narrator is there to tell your story - with his own brand of snark. Definitely an engaging concept I've not seen before.

* **Immersive World:** While the game may be somewhat light on an actual plot, the world of Bastion is well developed.  Every character you meet has a history, including the protagonist.  Different locations, groups, and NPCs are discovered and embellished as you progress through the game.  When all is said and done, you'll appreciate the small parts of the world not shattered by the Calamity.

* **Diverse Gameplay:** Bastion is assuredly a hack n' slash RPG, where you move through levels smashing mobs into dust.  However, the *means* by which you accomplish this goal is sundry enough to hold your interest.  You choose from over 10 different weapons - be they hammers, muskets, machetes, or mortars - each with a slew of special powers and upgrades.  Your character, likewise, may choose from a myriad of 'spirits' (passive bonuses) which are used to customize your character. All of the weapons have their niche, and these mechanics allow for different styles of play.

* **Flexible Difficulty:** Bastion features a fairly innovative way of adjusting the difficulty of your game.  As you play, you will unlock various 'idols' which you can use to invoke the pantheon of the world.  Each idol will make the game harder, in different and sometimes frightening ways.  Want to make enemies tougher? Faster? More aggressive? Want to make them explode when they die? You can!

* **Pick Up &amp; Play:** Bastion was originally styled as an Xbox Arcade game - it is a smaller, more easily digested offering.  The average playthrough might last ~8 hours, and the game is easily divided into small levels and challenges easily conquered in a single sitting.  While not an advantage for everyone, it definitely lets you dive in and out of the experience quickly!

* **Replay Value:** Despite being a shorter game, Bastion does boast plenty of reason to revisit the world of Caelondia.  With its large weapon loadout and diverse difficulty settings, you can set yourself up for a fresh challenge.  It also sports a 'Score Attack' mode with leaderboards, if you care to play it like an arcade game.

Ultimately, Bastion is an extremely well-developed game that succeeds on all levels.  Its art direction, music, narrative, and mechanics all intertwine to deliver a great experience.

**P.S.** Steam has a [**demo**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/) available for anyone who is still on the fence.

**P.P.S.** As an extra bonus, the game is presently [**on sale**](https://www.humblebundle.com/weekly) as part of a Humble Bundle until the end of the week.  You can score a Steam-redeemable copy of Bastion for **as little as $1**.

In summary, this is a heavily narrative driven dark fantasy game with fantastic graphics, very strong art directions, boobies, and a compelling plot.  This sort of game is the reason i play games.  The choices in this game matter a lot, it has a remarkably divergent plot structure and in fact you are guaranteed NOT to see all of the game in one pass.  The combat is fun, although a little wonky at times.  But the characters and deep and remarkably complete, but most importantly the game itself is a complete story.  

I played this in the wake of having played ME2 and Dragon Age and the most obvious comparison point between these games was the story craft.  Where the choices you make in ME2 really don't change anything you can't complete a main plot story without impacting the game universe.  The best way to describe it is that the game world bleeds.  Even though the Witcher 2 had a lot of the features that were absent in the venerable ME2 series this is what made the experience fun and compelling.

Lucas Pope, the creator of Papers, Please is both a genius and a madman.  But with this dystopian paper pushing thriller, he's nailed it.  This is the kind of game that will have many imitators in the not too distant future.

What makes the game worthwhile?

* The Story Mode actually pulls you through a very interesting set of circumstances.  The narrative, which is delivered in bits and pieces, does a great job of making you care about the fictional world.
* The process of going through documents and checking for errors is strangely compelling.  This is coming from someone who a) sucks at pixel hunting games and b) hates this aspect of my real life job.
* There are multiple branching paths to take through the game, multiple endings, and you can start from any of the 30 days in the story mode and create a branching save point.  Brilliant.
* Extra game modes add lots of replayability.  Immigration score attack? Yes please.

Obviously, the title is a joke -- at least meant to be more in line with the game itself.  But the game is worth $10 at the very least.  And if you're waiting for a sale?

But it seems to me that reposting is actually a good thing on this subreddit, for several reasons:

1. More people will see the post and comment. I typically like to get as much information as possible before buying a game, and if I can search the subreddit and find 5 threads with 5 comments each, that strikes me as a lot more useful than one thread with 5 comments. This is really a discussion based subreddit as opposed to a content based one, so why does it matter if the same discussion (presumably with different participants) happens multiple times? We're looking for opinions, not facts.

2. This is a pretty low traffic subreddit. Right now on the front page we have multiple 4 day-old posts, as well as posts about 2 steam sales that have expired. I don't think clogging up the subreddit with an additional 3-4 reposts per day is going to bury useful information.

3. Information changes. If new content is released for a game, or the game goes on sale, or the price is reduced, or the sequel is coming out, obviously the answer to ""should I buy this game"" is going to be different. Even if nothing about the game itself changes, maybe better games have come out for cheaper since the post. Information from 6 months ago is frankly dated. It can still be useful, but it is nevertheless dated.

4. The poster himself (herself?) might have different circumstances/preferences than anyone who has posted before. ""I have $10 and am considering buying X Game on sale. I'm looking for a game that will keep me busy for a long time and I am a huge fan of games A, B, and C"" will be looking for different feedback than someone who posts ""I'm a casual gamer who wants something diverting while I wait for Game of Thrones to start again"".

We recently had some questions come to light as to where the line is drawn for questions about unreleased games. In this specific case, the user was asking whether or not he should buy Arma II now, or wait for the Day Z standalone. This one falls in a bit of a grey area, as do a lot of these types of posts. 

The idea of this sub is for users to recommend games based on their own experience. Because of that, the rule of thumb is that if someone can play it, talk about it, show video footage, etc, then they are able to give a well-backed opinion on it. If conjecture is involved, then its a no-go. 

This means that open alphas/betas, Steam early release, publicly available mods, etc. are all fine, but things in Kickstarter, preorder games, or games covered by an NDA are not allowed. We will continue to delete those. 

In the case of the Day Z standalone, it did technically break the rules, especially since the standalone will likely be a horse of a very different color compared to the current mod, but we decided to leave it up since the post centered more around whether or not the user should buy Arma II or not. 

Now on to the fun stuff! Or not...

You may have noticed we have a familiar face here moderating now: AutoModerator. He (I decided it's a he) will help us enforce the same rules we have already been enforcing. We do not, however, watch every move he makes, so if you have a problem with him removing your posts, send a message to the mods or to myself, and we will take care of it.

(and right now, it's free!)",UwasaWaya,118,14,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1j1404/ysp_starmade_its_like_minecraft_in_spaaaaaaace/,"So I noticed this little game on the new list of Greenlit Steam games yesterday. The description describes something Minecrafty, but in a sci fi setting (no, not like Star Forge). I then noticed that not only is it currently playable... it's *free*.

So what is it? Well, long story short, it's the game I've always wanted to play. You spawn in space, near a trade station, just a little guy floating in the ether. You start with a ship's core, some hull parts, some guns and some engines. The tutorial walks you through dropping the core, from which you pilot the ship, and hooking up guns and engines. Now you can fly and shoot. It's fun! 

At some point, you realize that you could use armor. So you put hull over the core and engines. That's when you realize it... you're in space (infinite, procedurally generated space) and that size isn't a problem. So you build a little room with engines and it hits you... you can build *anything*. 

In the shop, you realize there are parts like gravity generators, doors and docking points. 

When you consider multiplayer, you can have a group of friends, all on the same server, all working on the same huge ship. You can all walk around it together. You can tie different systems to different consoles. One person might operate the turrets (or you can install AI cores and have them control themselves!), or, even better, build a launch bay and store a squadron of fighters. 

From there, there's exploration... the universe is filled with planets, abandoned stations and asteroids... and you can build fully stocked, protected, and automated factories and stations for production and harvesting.

For me, this game is highly, highly recommended. Getting the hang of setting up connections is kind of weird ('c' activates the core, 'v' connects another core to it. 't' lets you assign weapons to hotkeys.) but once you do, the possibilities are endless. 

You can find it : [here](http://star-made.org/)

**TL;DR: Multiplayer Minecraft in space where you build and pilot your own ship and/or ships.**

I wrote a [YSB for The Walking Dead](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1c0vnv/ysb_the_walking_dead/) a month ago, and I think you deserve an update. 

The Walking Dead is more of a choose-your-own-adventure interative story than a traditional game. But its fantastic believable characters, graphic-novel art style, and emotional punch deserve mention. 

**PROS**: 

* GREAT story

* Believable characters, likable kid character

* Cool art style that mimics the art of the graphic novels series

* An emotional effect on the player

* Cheap right now

**CONS**:

* Your choices don't hold as much weight as the player might want [Your choices don't matter in the long run except for the existence of auxiliary characters, and the ending stays the same](/spoiler)

* Made of mild puzzle solving, but mostly Quick-time events

* Some Issues with save files


I think the biggest pro going for this game is the price right now. This game is mentioned **A LOT** in most WSIBs regarding story in games, and the current price you'd have to pay is $3.75, where-as the previous lowest sale price was 9.99. 

Some could argue that the biggest pro to this bundle is the inclusion of other Telltale games, including Back To The Future, Sam &amp; Max, Puzzle Agent 1+2, Poker Night At The Inventory, and Wallace &amp; Gromit.

Here's what I can dispense:

**Hotline Miami** - fast paced, drug-fueled frenzy of violence. It's got a fantastic soundtrack even for those not crazy about 80's trance electronic music. It's all trial-and-error but it's so fast to restart that your hearbeat will never slow down. It's very very addicting and difficult, but never in a very frustrating way. Death is very quick and you're never really punished that much for dying. Well worth the average price alone. 

**Proteus** - this is the most calming experience I've had in a ""game."" I put that in quotations because this isn't really a game. It's an interactive landscape where the music changes with the environment. It's all about walking around and taking in the sights and sounds.

**Little Inferno** - /u/occupy_voting_booth says ""Little Inferno is dripping with style, I love the art in this game. It's really kind of a story that plays out over about 2.5 - 3 hours depending on how slow you go. You essentially burn things, and try to find combos by burning two or more different items together. It's a neat little puzzle/story/game that is well worth the price of admission here.""

**Awesomenauts** - /u/tablloyd says ""Awesomenauts is a sort of mixture between Smash Bros and DOTA or LoL. Teams of 3 start on opposite sides of the map, and attack each other to destroy their towers and bases. Things that are important in Dota are less important in Awesomenauts like lane switching and recharge time because the map is much more maneuverable. It is also a lot more twitch based (the smash bros side of it) and is often played with a gamepad due to the style.""

**Capsized** - this has been in previous bundles. 2d platformer with good art. Haven't played it myself

**Thomas was alone** - at first glance and on mute this game looks oversimple. It's just a block jumping on other blocks right? Well the fantastic narration makes you actually get an emotional attachment and connection with this object, giving it the name Thomas. I swear, it took me by surprise how involved I got in the game. 

**Dear Esther** - Like Proteus, this is not a traditional game. Through narration just like in Thomas Was Alone, you piece together a story. You just walk around the landscape and piece it together through clues. It started as a HL2 mod, and I find it engaging. But it's not for everyone. ADDED: I have already played an hour of this game, and I'm blown away by the narration and writing. I also love the graphics, but keep in mind it's more of an amusement attraction than a game

**Who should buy this bundle?** $5 is generally the cheapest Hotline Miami has gone for, and it's worth a shot. There is something in here for any indie gamer. But if you like atmospheric games, Proteus, Thomas Was Alone, and Dear Esther have you covered. 

Also, it's all DRM-free and comes with soundtracks and steam keys

Please note, I played the PC version and I highly recommend it on PC because it is amazing.  Perhaps people in the comments can shed some light on the console versions, but I'm going to guess that the console versions are going to have worse graphics at the least.  If you can, get it on PC.  If you can't, then I'm sure the game is just as enjoyable on either console.

##You should buy if:

If you are a fan of FPS games then this should be a must buy.  **If you have not played Bioshock 1 or 2 then do not worry, as they have no major connection to Bioshock Infinite.**  This is also stated on the [Bioshock Infinite FAQ](http://irrationalgames.com/insider/bioshock-infinite-faq/).

If you love the other Bioshock games this is a must buy.

If you hated/didn't like Bioshock 1 or 2 because of the horror elements, but enjoyed the gameplay then this game is a great alternative.  Unlike the other two games, Infinite is a much brighter game and although does have its gory moments, the only times where you might feel scared is while playing in certain sections where the buildings are run down and/or don't have much electricity.  The game doesn't try to scare you much more than that though.

##You should watch some videos if:

If you don't like FPS games because they are stale or boring.  This game mixes up your typical FPS shooter games so this could be something you enjoy, especially if you like good stories.

If you hate all FPS games but are interested in good stories/are interested in this game but aren't 100% sure if it will be for you.  Watching some gameplay videos will help sway you into one way or the other.

##You should not buy this game if:
If you don't care for stories or FPS games.  

If you want to play a multiplayer game.  There currently is no multiplayer modes for Infinite.

If you are looking to save money.  At the moment of writing this there are some sales out there for 25% off PC, but if you don't have $60 to spend on this game and are waiting for a price drop or sale then go ahead and wait.  Sub to /r/gamedeals, set up a tent, and camp for a long long while.
****

##Quick Overview:
To start things off, **you do not need to play Bioshock 1 or 2 to play this game.**  This is a very common question and the reason why you don't need to play the other games is because there just isn't a major connection between the two story lines, if any at all.  The only similar thing is that all three games have similar game mechanics and gameplay.

Bioshock Infinite's gameplay this time around is much more action focused.  Similar to the other games your right trigger is your gun while your left hand is used for ""magic"" spells known as Vigors.  Vigors are cool different spells that differ from shooting fireballs out of your hand, making machines or enemies become your allies, and much more.  The weapons in this game are pretty generic, rifles, shotguns, grenade launchers, RPGs, etc. but you can upgrade your weapons and your Vigors with in game money.  You can only carry two weapons at once (unlike the other Bioshock games), but your upgrades are permanent and you do not have to re-purchase them.  In addtion to this there is new clothing that you can find throughout playing the game.  Clothing offers random effects and bonuses from having a chance of igniting your opponent on fire after using a melee attack or increasing your reload speed.  Finally, the game offers sections where you grapple on hooks and travel via sky railways, sometimes in combat.  This offers a fun and fresh way of combat and traveling and is definitely a bonus to this game.

One of the disapointing things about Infinite is that the game stays away from hacking mechanics.  If you played Bioshock 1 or 2 you might have been looking forward to this in Infinite, but it is simply non-existent.  Hacking machines is now simply a Vigor that will put a machine or an enemy as an ally for a short period of time.  Pick locking safes now requires picklocks which can be found hidden throughout levels.  Your partner can pick these locks where a door might require 1 picklock and a safe might require 5.  Not the end of the world because sometimes hacking was annoying and repetitive in the other games and have made it more simple for this game.

There are only two other things that bother me:  The AI and lack of checkpoints.  The AI in this game isn't incredibly retarded, but in some moments when the AI doesn't react to something right away it makes the game feel a little less realistic.  Again, the AI isn't completely horrible, it does a lot of impressive things, but at the same time isn't perfect either.  Finally, the game lacks a save feature which is really annoying.  The game instead has various checkpoints that you can reload to, but isn't necessary because if you die the game uses nearby doors or rooms to respawn you.  The reason why these checkpoints suck is if you do something wrong or wanted to test something out and reverse it then you have to rely all on the checkpoint system.  One time I accidentally killed someone and wasn't sure how that would affect the game so I wanted to revert to my checkpoint and I had to redo a 5 minute fight scene.  Annoying and I hope its something they fix at least on PC if not consoles too.

The story itself is pretty good.  I am trying to stay as spoiler free as possible here, so without giving much away Bioshock Infinite takes place in 1912 in a [sky city](http://i.imgur.com/LrCtIih.jpg) called Colombia based on extreme American nationalism.  The story deals a lot about what happens with these extremist views along about the main character and his goal to pay back his debt by finding a girl in Columbia.

****
##Conclusion:
So, that's my quick review/explanation on the game.  My tl;dr version is at the top on if you should buy the game or not.  If you have any suggestions, things that should be added here, or if I got some information wrong then let me know.  If you bought the game and are having a great or horrible time then feel free to write your own opinions in the comments.

1347640415.0,88,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,zvszn,YSB:  FTL:Faster Than Light,circa_1982,96,8,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/zvszn/ysb_ftlfaster_than_light/,"FTL is a new rogue-like game independently developed by the two-man team at Subset Games: Matthew Davis and Justin Ma.  It is one of the first major Kickstarter success stories to actually be released to the public, having exceeded its initial $10,000.00 goal by 2000% percent.

So those are all the feel-good indie game supporting reasons to buy the game, but here's one more: IT'S FUCKING AWESOME.

I have been playing this game every night for a week now since it was released to backers from the Kickstarter campaign.  It's got a ""just-one-more-turn"" stickiness unmatched outside of the Civilization series, and the game play is both complex and compelling.

The narrative structure of FTL is that you are a Federation ship attempting to evade capture by Rebel forces as you jump from sector to sector one step ahead of your pursuers.  Along the way you will fight many battles and make many decisions: do I risk sending my crew into that abandoned space station? Should I intervene to help an escaped prisoner who has just beamed on board my ship or sell him back to his captors for a healthy ransom?

All along the way you will upgrade your ship with new weapons and systems, new crew members, and make upgrades to your limited power resources to juice all these new toys.  Your playstyle will shift dramatically from one run to the next as you adapt to the randomly-generated weapons and defenses coming your way and make the best of it in an atmosphere of limited resources.

The combat is tightly tuned, and the constant decision making and resource balancing will draw you in and hook you.  You don't aim shots or fight intruders manually, but you do control power to the various systems on your ship (weapons, engines, shields, sensors, etc.).  Do you take your experienced crewman off the engines and send him to fight off an intruder?  You'll reduce your dodge chance, but you may stop him from trashing your shields.  Do you send someone to put out a fire mid-combat, or do you just let it burn and metastasize until you can get to it in the lull after battle?  Or do you just open the airlocks and vent it out into space?

The constant stream of decisions and reactions will appeal to any fan of rogue-likes or RTS games, and the well-implemented space theme (ably amplified by a truly excellent chiptunes soundtrack) will hook SciFi fans.  The game is very low-intensity from a graphical perspective and will run on nearly any PC, but the art style is fun and effective at conveying the information you need to manage your starship on its journey.

I'll stop ranting now, because I'm sure the google will lead you to many more in-depth and helpful descriptions than I can give you in this space (no pun intended).  However, for the insanely good price of $10.00, you really can't go wrong with this excellent game.

It's an open-world medieval RPG (No magic). First off, The entire game is unscripted, except for the very beginning. One playthrough, Swadia may conquer the Khergits. On another, The Nords can try world domination, but be pushed to a corner by all of the other factions forming an alliance. It goes on. 

And meanwhile,you have to make your own story, and put effort to fulfill the role you want. Want to become a king/queen? Earn that right to rule. Want to be a bandit? Go raid some caravans. Want to be a mercenary? Go build some fame in tournaments and such, go up to a kingdom, and offer your service. Unless you are looking a special kind of work (Mainly for quests), you will rarely get a fetch quest, and they usually are very easy. Your reputation actually matters. Drunk men looking for a fight will suddenly realize who you are and leave the tavern. People will comment on how well-known you are. If you aren't already tied by oath to a kingdom (Or you are the king/queen), you will receive offers from a faction to join then. You can have more people in your party if you are well known. I never played as an evil dude, but to be honest there is no evil in Mount &amp; Blade. It's the kind of game where everyone is just as bad as everyone else, and there is no strict good vs evil.

Currently I'm playing as a common man who became a local hero and tournament champion, in which the Khergits saw my usefulness and hired me as a vassal. I own a village and two castles, and helped push the Swadians back to their main cities, Praven and Suno. If I wanted to, I can defect to the Swadians and help them out at retaking Dhirim and Uxkhal. I could ignore the war and focus on my own personal gain. I could defect and start my own rebel faction, but it would probably be crushed immediately. There's a ton of freedom. Also the world is very dynamic. If you were to make a new character and sit inside an inn for 100-500 days, the world would be very different from what it started as. You aren't the god-king of everything where the world turns around you. You are nothing. The world turns on its own. 

And meanwhile the combat is easy to learn, difficult to master. The battles are MASSIVE, going up to 200v200 (100v100 for multiplayer), with reinforcements/multiple battle stages if there are more. It sounds like it's a total mess, but it's not. It's a Paradox game, so you may expect bugs and crashes. It's actually more polished than most Paradox games. There is a decent economy. It's not on the level of some other games, but you can buy land to be used for production (I have a tannery which makes a small amount of denars per week), play on demands and such, and a bit more. There is a ton of replay value, since it's an emergent gameplay sandbox. JUST GET IT. Last M&amp;B sale, I gave a copy to a friend and my brother, who didn't know anything about the game. They both LOVED it. GET IT. There are also mods that completely change the game. And an active multiplayer community. And it's currently $5. Dozens of hours (Some people have hundreds, a few have over 1000) of fun for less a lunch at a fast-food restaurant. GET IT. Ignore the Metacritic score. GET IT. Do I have to say it again? GET IT.

Also, about the other M&amp;B games, The original is outdated, but has some good mods. With Fire and Sword is good (Not as great as Warband though), but playing it as a newcomer is a bad idea, as you will get one-shotted by firearms all the time. However, for $3.75 more, why not get the collection?

**TL;DR Mount &amp; Blade: Warband is an epic open-world RPG which everyone even remotely interested should buy NOW.**",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,1342400321.0,,,True,t3_wm421,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/wm421/ysb_mount_blade_warband/,

Hey guys. Not everyone wants to waste time searching for threads on games that went for sale this week, so I tried my best and collect most of the 

threads for you to click and read!  
Friendly note from /u/YummyMeatBalls, if you thinking of buying a game on sale, make sure to check out Amazon, usually they sell steam keys for an 

even lower price!

They just entered open beta, BUT there are no more character wipes.  
Some highlights:  

* A passive skill tree containing 1350 'skills'.

* Active skills come from gem items, allowing for out of the ordinary builds (e.g. spellcaster barb! eh maybe)
* Loot Loot Loot! Even white items are valuable. Uniques are pretty tough to find, but rares can roll great stats as well.
* Amazing crafting/rerolling/upgrading system.
* Did you hate the gold inflation in Diablo 3 and Torchlight2? No such thing as gold in this game; currency comes in the form of many different crafting items &amp; ID/TP scrolls.
* Hardcore is fun and death moves you to normal mode instead of making you lose everything (one of the best features).
* Great balance in the game difficulty, been playing with 2 friends co-op only, no outside trading, and the game has been fun, challenging (hardcore), and definitely not impossible or too easy.
* FREE TO PLAY? (Please support these people if you love the game)  
* 24 characters per account, pretty large sized shared stash (4 tabs) and both can be extended via microtransactions (microtransactions only affect stash space, character slots, and aesthetics).  
* PvP is out, but it doesn't always feel balanced (still fun though)
* No dumb time-grabbing mechanics (IDing is instant, crafting is instant, unsocketing gems is free and can be done anywhere)  
* Unique potion system, end game maps  (haven't reached here)

Some possible downsides I can think of:  

* If you enjoyed the AH in Diablo 3, then this might not be the game for you as there is no central currency (people trade items for items), and no formal AH.  

* Not for the simple minded: complex skill tree, gem system, and even socket system.  
* Uses instance system (I personally like this)  
* Still in beta, so there may be bugs (haven't experienced any)  
* Can be a time sink  (why play games)",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,,True,t3_17fxha,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/17fxha/ysb_support_path_of_exile_if_you_liked_diablo_2/,

It's (loosely) inspired by Drive, with a little Grand Theft Auto and Manhunt thrown in for good measure. It's got a distinct 80's setting and is one of the few games that uses a retro style well rather than as a cop-out for a lack of artistic skill.

The whole game is *very* fast-paced, reinforced by the coked-up druggish feeling you get from the art style and the soundtrack which, by the way, is probably the best I've heard this year. The game is easily worth it *just* for the soundtrack, even though it holds it's own in basically every other way.

The game has a simple concept: Run inside a building, kill everybody, and leave. Pulling it off, however, is quite difficult. A split-second mistake could kill you. Much like Dwarf Fortress, dying is *fun* in Hotline Miami. I've never been interested in getting the highest score or speedrunning a game, but I do it in Hotline Miami just as an excuse to play more and more. 

The story is intentionally vague and more of a sideshow than the focus, much like Dark Souls. If you want to know more about the story, you can by finding newspaper clippings and other bits of lore, but otherwise, you can just play for fun. If you do decide to dig in a little deeper, you will be rewarded. I really love Hotline Miami's story.

The only real downside to this game is the length. It's not a very long game. The first playthrough can take about three hours. That said, I've spent ten hours playing it because replaying it is just as fun as when you first start. I often find myself replaying levels just to see how smoothly I can transition from one kill to the next. There are quite a few weapons and methods of killing enemies, which keeps the near-excessive slaughter from becoming repetitive. 

All in all, I consider Hotline Miami to be my indie game of the year. It had a shaky release, but most of the bugs have been fixed by now, and the game is *great*.

This game was one of the most satisfying games I've ever played. It perfectly shows what an RPG is supposed to be like, while still retaining the fun goofy style of Mario games and tells an amazing story. The side quests are fantastic and on a first time play through, the story will blow your mind. I'd definitely get it.

**Mechanics**

The mechanics in this game are top notch, especially for a Gamecube game. The 2D-yet-3D environment is crazy, giving you the limitations of a 2D world in a 3D world. Imagine you're looking at a classic 2D side-scroller Mario game and tilt the camera slightly downward, giving you a 3D world. But everything is made of paper which is 2D. It's basically a grade-A mindfuck. The movement is solid, which really solidifies the papery feel of the whole game. The in-game menus aren't confusing and the controls feel right. 

**Gameplay**

This game has some intense gameplay. The battle scenes are spectacular, acting like you on a stage battling your paper enemy in front of a crowd. Depending on whether you get applause from the audience or not, you can get items that effect the game in a good way or a bad way. The partners that you receive throughout the game are just what the game needed to give a difference in attacks. If you feel like you need healing more than attack from your partner you can go with one person or another. The puzzles that the game includes are ingenious, stretching the limits of your paper confines to ways you might not have considered. The mini games, such as a quiz show to get through a door, are hilarious and give the game that much needed feel of humor and Marioness.

**Story**

The story is perfect. It blends together the story of multiple characters, Mario's original quest along with all the other partners that you get and each individual chapter has its own spectacular story line with great characters. The basic story is as follows: Mario has to collect 7 crystal stars to save the world once again. Each star is in a different part of the world, guarded by different people, some guarded heavily, some not so much. It's your job to get each crystal star, leveling up and finding partners along the way. It's a unique story with some fantastic humor along the way. My personal favorite quirk in the story is after every chapter you can find Luigi telling an adventure that he goes on which is pure brilliant. I love this story to death.

**Conclusion**

This game is fantastic. It blends seamlessly Mario and RPGs, proving that it can be difficult while still enjoyable. To me, this game is the best out of the series, improving greatly on Paper Mario and a step up from Super Paper Mario. I know some of you may not have a Gamecube or a Wii, but getting this game is one of the best decisions you'll ever make. The music, the story, the characters, the graphics, the whole feel of the game just makes me want to play it over and over again. I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes RPGs or Mario or both. I'm sure you can get an emulator for it somewhere if you really want to play it.",,False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,,True,t3_11fhbq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/11fhbq/ysb_paper_mario_the_thousandyear_door/,

Even though the title is just in its alpha test phase, **Cube World** has given me some of the most fun and enjoyable moments of gaming I can remember in recent history.  There is no denying that the title is in a very bare bones state right now, with no quests, story or really direction of any sort to speak of (as should be expected of an Alpha release).  However, this game has scratched an itch that I haven't been able to relieve for nearly a year - multiplayer exploration.

Cube World is essentially an MMO.  You have four classes to choose from each with their own specialties and weapon/armor sets - Warrior, Mage, Rogue and Ranger, with many races to choose from as well.  You travel around, gather loot, defeat bosses, very typical MMO style gameplay.  The action is much faster paced than your typical MMO as the combat happens in real time, with every swing of your sword or shot of fire from your wand controlled in a very Action RPG style as opposed to the ""right click to attack"" style of gameplay seen in more popular MMOs like WoW.

The most wonderful thing about this title as it currently stands is its world, which you create.  Every time a new world is created, a ""seed"" number can be chosen for it.  This number is, in essence, part of an algorithm that then dynamically creates the world around you.  Every seed is a brand new world for you to explore, and each world in itself is endless.  There is quite literally no way for you to ever see everything that the game has to offer.  Heading south in one ""seed"" may lead you towards the ocean.  Doing the same in another may lead you to a lava-ridden world of fire and brimstone.  The bosses, loot and landscape of each ""seed"" are completely unique.  The ways to explore the world are quite fun as well, as you can purchase a small boat for faster travel over water, or find a mount for faster travel over land.  You can even get a hangglider and fly from one mountain peak to the next.  Just searching for the next pile of ore or trekking to the next boss has not been this enjoyable for quite a while.

It's worth noting that the game does NOT work well on any computer with an Intel graphics card.  The game is currently not supported on anything other than Windows, although Mac and Linux versions are on the way.  Also, the multiplayer is currently server based, but luckily the game comes packed with a program to make your own server on your PC so you and up to three friends can explore.  This game *must* be played with friends, it makes for thrilling and hilarious gameplay.

Bear in mind that the game is currently in alpha, so there are quite a few bugs and loopholes to be found in the game, not to mention hackers on servers that have incredible items and health from the get go (although there is no PvP yet).  The funniest of these glitches allows the ranger class to fly at insane speeds when using a hangglider.  This is not a finished game, so do not go into it expecting a full, polished title.  However, if you want to be a part of what looks to be one of the next big multiplayer PC titles and its building process, hand over the $20 (when you can).

The way it feels is just delicious. The default movement style is an I'm-a-total-badass half crouching ninja lunge that just makes you want to watch a Samurai Jack marathon.

Unlike Samurai Jack though, the focus is on stealth and avoiding conflict - this is made up for however, when you drag some poor bastard into a vent by his ankles and fillet him as he screams.

There are quicktime events in this game. Normally that's something that makes me go ""ugh..."" but they don't come out of nowhere and only serve to make stabbing a fool more satisfying, a definite positive.

The sight and sound systems are great as well, extremely intuitive and interesting in how they can be manipulated to help you or they can hinder you.

IMHO, you should definitely buy this game. Even if you don't normally like stealth games, this moves at your pace so can adapt to suit almost anyone.

Hey guys, I hope you guys are having a great start to this New Year. What better way to start it here than with a new flair system? After toying around with the old Gamer of the Week system for a while, I thought (with the help of /u/Izual09 ) that it would be much better for people to see the level of quality that a user's post is. So, let us get this show on the road!
****
**The System**
****
This system will consist of four different levels: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Trophy. Each of these levels will require a certain level of qualification, stemming from the quality of posts that you as a user consistently make. I will be handing out a few of these levels to some of the older users who may not be as active but definitely deserve them. For each level you achieve, you will receive a small flair next to your name, both an image and text, describing your level. An active link in the sidebar (as well as a small description) will lead back to this post for the newcomers that may not understand how this works. The ranks are as follows:
****
**NOTE: THESE ARE GUIDELINES, NOT RULES. YOU CAN FULFILL ALL OF THEM AND NOT BE MOVED UP AND VICE VERSA.**
****

-**Bronze**-

To qualify for this level, you must:

* Participate actively and relatively frequently on this subreddit
* Have meaningful and helpful posts that encourage the questioner to make a decision
* Understand what constitutes a valid comment and what is just not needed
* Be nice, but not withholding your point

This is the bottom-most ranking, for the people that are fresh out of the gate to prove themselves. You will probably see the most people this rank.
****

-**Silver**-

To qualify for this level, you must:

* Understand your way around this community
* Provide consistently very helpful posts
* Make eloquent posts that help people to their decisions
* Show your prowess on this subreddit

This level is for the users who know their way around, being helpful day after day, a voice of reason that doesn't participate in the circle jerk of upvotes and opinions.
****

-**Gold**-

To qualify for this level, you must:

* Convey your opinions accurately and precisely
* Show other users exactly why or why not they should do what you recommend
* Have an relatively long experience with this subreddit
* Make a plethora of posts pertaining to a variety of subjects

This ranking is for the better people of the subreddit, people that have been here a while and are fantastic posters. These guys will have the most unbiased opinions and the ones that you should probably trust the most. There won't be many of these guys.
****

-**Trophy**-

To qualify for this level, you must:

* Be on of the best posters on this subreddit
* Participate actively day after day after day with consistently helpful information
* Have an unbiased point of view
* Be a veteran of this subreddit and of its rules and ways
* Prove to the mods that you are worthy

This ranking is the highest level, the cream of the crop here at r/SIBTG. These users will be the absolute best people here and will be able to help you extremely well. There will be only a few of these guys.
****

If you feel that you or someone else should be of a certain higher (or lower) ranking, send myself, or the entire mod team, a PM and we'll try and get it sorted out.

Let's keep up the great work guys! To another 10,000!

One of the major problems of Battlefield 3 is that maps are not well designed. There are ""rush maps"" and ""conquest maps"". Many conquest maps are too small for conquest, and they need more flags and longer distances. Older battlefields managed this well. And I am talking about this with 64 players. With 24 players (the console version) the maps are just wayy too large. And for rush, the conquest maps are okayish, but have problems like too long distances between MCOMS.

And the rush maps.. they are well designed when it comes to size, but they are too easy to defend. If the defending team is not retarded you must spam heavily your smoke GL to get to the MCOM stations. Also, rush maps have too much places which are extremely hard to pass as an attacker. For conquest, these ""rush maps"" are too tiny for 64 players. With less players it doesn't help either. The maps are just garbage.

Now let's talk about Bad Company 2.

Battlefield 3 has advertised how you can have advanced destruction etc etc.. these are all lies. In reality you can barely use destruction as your advantage, because almost everything is indestructable. In Bad company 2, this is fixed. You can literally destroy almost every wall, and you can also demolish most of the structures.

 Bad Company 2 has one of the best audio design, not sure if the best audio design in video games ever. It is so aggressive and literally gets your blood pressure hard. You hear hard hitting weapons everywhere, explosions, battle cries.. and the voice acting is extremely good! Lots of swearing, lots of aggression, panicking.. If we compare this to BF3, everything sounds lame and suppressed. It sounds like you are wearing a protective headset. And the voice acting.. oh my god. It is very cringe-worthy, especially on russian side. If you still don't believe how awesome BC2 audio is, [watch this while your eyes are closed.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-Hy_6lW6jM) Then open your eyes and watch it again. You will be amazed.

Map design. Most of the maps in Bad Company 2 are designed rush in mind, and they are damn good. Attackers gain small advantages like more vehicles, but defenders have the defending advantage. Assaulting is much harder than holding the line. Conquest is crap in Bad Company 2 but it wasn't designed for it either.

I played battlefield 3 for 200 hours and got bored. I have played BC2 for 500 hours and I am still playing.

If you are playing on PC, consider heavily Bad Company 2 instead of BF3.

If you are playing on console.. get the Bad Company 2.",[Any],False,,t5_2ud8h,1361908501.0,,,True,t3_199z8x,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/199z8x/ysb_battlefield_bad_company_2_instead_of/,
1353612364.0,67,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,13mrzc,[YSB] Recettear: an Item Shop's Tale,mctuckles,75,8,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/13mrzc/ysb_recettear_an_item_shops_tale/,"Hey guys,

I figured I'd just put this up seeing as the last YSB of this game was 4 months ago, and it's currently [50% off on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/70400/?snr=1_614_615_autumn2012indie_sdd).

So. What is Recettear?

Recettear is a game about a town lass named ""Recette"" and a fairy named ""Tear"". Recette's father was an adventurer who suddenly disappeared. Sound familiar? Where that's about as familiar as it'll get, because instead of leaving Recette a legendary sword and a noble quest, he left her ass-deep in debt. That's why we meet Tear. She's there to collect.

So, how does a young girl like Recette pay back her debt? Go dungeoneering? Nonsense! Leave that to the dirty adventurers. She opens up a shop! In Recettear, instead of being the dungeon delving edgy hero, you play as the under appreciated and oft-forgotten shopkeeper. It's your task to stock up with whatever the adventurers need and sell it to them at exorbitant prices, but Recette can't call yourself a grade A shopkeeper if she can't guarantee the quality of your goods. How does she do that? Well, obviously, she goes and inspects them at the source! As a merchant, she follows her intrepid ~~customers~~ heroes into dungeons and gets a cut of the loot. The very same loot she sells back to them.

And that's Recettear's story in a nutshell.

The game is a tongue-in-cheek homage to old school dungeon crawlers. You play the item shop owner. As the owner, you have to make ends meet by stocking up on important gear and healing items, then selling it to customers. When you sell, you don't just set a price. It's a battle of wits against the customer to try to get the highest price (or the lowest if they're the ones selling). Before you can sell anything though, you'll have to attract customers. You do this buy prettifying your shop and making sure that the classier items are the ones that they see in the storefront. Along the way, you'll meet a large cast of characters. These characters are all adventurers with their own unique fighting styles, and you'll be able to fund (and directly control) their expeditions. The cast of characters are what constitutes a class system in this game. These characters will also act as customers, buying the gear you sell and equipping them for when you go adventuring with them again. Combat is similar to games like Ys and Rune Factory. That is to say it's a hack and slash dungeon crawler. The goal of the game is to earn enough money every month to pay back your debt.

Overall, it's a fun little game, and it's worth the $10 they're asking for.",[Steam],False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,,True,t3_13mrzc,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/13mrzc/ysb_recettear_an_item_shops_tale/,

This game has so much content now, it's laughable compared to other games by other developers with their DLCs.



Yesterday Valve released a ""patch"" with additional 5 campaigns to play (4 of them are from the first L4D, so it's not like you have to buy both games unless you're a game collector, or you want to play these campaigns without melee weapons, and special infected introduced in L4D2), and now you've got 13 ""official"" campaigns, that you can play both **single-player**, **coop**, **coop with realism** (no ""wallhack"" and no hints if I remember correctly), **versus mode** (4 players play as survivors, 4 players play as special infected), **versus realism mode**, and **mutation** (this mode changes every week - it gives some variation to the campaign mode, like right now survivors' weapon is only M60, and also you got two other modes - **scavenge** - it's similiar to versus, but you're not going through the campaign, only a map with a certain objective to do, and **survival** (survive as long as you can)


Therefore there's PLENTY to do in this game, and even if you somehow complete everything, there are always custom maps available on http://www.l4dmaps.com/ so I think 3,49€ or whatever price is in USD is a freaking joke for a game like L4D2.",,False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,bronze,True,t3_x4ldj,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/x4ldj/ysb_left_4_dead_2/,

Gameplay and Setting

The Walking Dead is a point and click game set in the Walking Dead comic books by Robert Kirkmon. The Walking Dead is a point and click adventure with a strong emphasis on character development and story. Mechanically there is not much to it because of the point and click aspect. There is very sparatic combat but it is not executed very well. The very first combat you have the reticule is way to large. However I give Telltale a break because they did not make a game based on bombat. You can tell within the first episode that the game is based on story. If you are looking for a Walking Dead combat game Survival Instinct which is set to be released March 26th 2013.



Graphics and Art Style

The graphic style of The Walking Dead is good. It has nice color to it and the scenory is great because there is good attention to detail. Even with good attention to detail the quality of the scenery is still good. However graphics are not the main strong point of the game. The graphics of the dead are very good. More specifically after a walker is shot/killed is very gory. I feel like the amount of gore is lowered greatly from the comics or TV show. You can run this game on nearly anything.

Story

The story of The Walking Dead is what makes this game. The Story of the game gives you major attachment to certain characters. The three big examples of this for me are Carly Kenny and Clem. I have never had such a strong attachment to characters in a video game before. The end of this game is the most shaken I have ever been from a video game. I just sat in front of my screen for the next 5 minutes. The story is a good step in the right direction for gaming as a viable medium for good stories. I have high hopes for any future seasons of the story.

* **Antichamber just does things differently:** Every single part of Antichamber feels like a crazy M.C. Escher painting on LSD. Most puzzles required me to think outside the box in ways that I never even thought were possible. 
* **I continually had my mind blown throughout my time with Antichamber:** Seriously, the amount of insanely cool shit in this game is ridiculous. I don't want to go into any more detail for fear of spoiling anything, but seriously, go play this game!
* **The game looks and sounds incredible:** Antichamber's aesthetic is incredibly unique, and I've never seen anything like it before.

I gave in and bought Black Ops 2 on PC which is my first Call of Duty since Modern Warfare 2. Back then I got tired of the same games and that when I found my love of the Battlefield series with Bad Company 2. 

The reason I bought the game is because I was looking for a shooter I could drop in and out of quickly as I don't really have an opportunity for longer gaming sessions anymore. Counter Strike is good in this respect as is Team Fortress 2 however I'm awful at Counter Strike and I just never really loved like so many others and I have roughly 200 hours into Team Fortress 2 over the last 4 years and I was looking or something new. I also found I just don't usually have the time for a couple games of BF3 or to try an get anything done in Planetside 2. 

Maybe it's because I've been away from the COD scene for so long but Black Ops 2 has been a really fun experience over the last few days I've had it. I am only talking about multiplayer as I haven't tried single player yet. The drop in and play a quick game was the biggest appeal to me but I got more than I was expecting. Maps are small and smaller than many I remember in MW2 but it seems to work well. I always thought Treyarch had good level design and I think they got a lot of them right, at least from what I've played. Action is constant, they've added some interesting weapons/gear and at least from the days of old many changes have been made to the unlock progression and create a class. 

Party games are a nice distraction from regular modes, as I understand these were in Black Ops 1 as well but for those who haven't played them there is a variety of free for all games such as:

 Gun game from counter strike where you progress through a set sequence of weapons

Sharpshooter where everybody in the game has the same weapon for a set duration of time and then it is switched

One in the chamber where you have a pistol with one shot. The only way to get more is to kill somebody. If you knife somebody without taking a shot you now have 2 bullets. (Intense at times, personal favourite)

Sticks and stones which they give you only a crossbow with explosive sticky bolts, a ballistics knife and a tomahawk

On top of your base mutiplayer they've now added league play. I have yet to really venture into this much but it looks like they've stolen a page from the Blizzard Starcraft 2 laddering system. Again I'm really not too sure how this all works as I only played one placement match. The description states that either as a team or solo you play placement matches to compete in a laddering system where you are matched up against players of similar skill. 

Of course with all recent Treyarch Call of Duty games Zombies is included too.  I've yet to venture much into this as well but it can be great fun co-op and while Left for Dead 2 might be a better and cheaper substitution CoD Zombies is a great add on especially if your looking for some co-op with friends. 

Single player I'll hold all judgement on since I've yet to play it at all. 

I am probably the furthest thing from a Call of Duty ""fanboy"" there is. I was looking for a game for a specific purpose, quick action filled multiplayer shooter, and Black Ops II has done this quite well. It absolutely has its shortcomings which include small maps, small teams, and non destructible environments. That said small maps and small teams are part of Black Ops II strengths as well. I realize this isn't the most popular series here on reddit and especially on PCs but if your somebody who stepped away from the series for a while because you were fed up with the same old over and over I do encourage you to give this a shot. I've been pleasantly surprised with how much fun I've had with it so far. It isn't for everybody which is why I titled it the way I have but it is definitely worth a look.

The reason why you shouldn't buy RO2 is that if you buy RS you also get full access to RO2 multiplayer. However, you won't get access to RO2 single-player, but that doesn't matter since it's just bots in multiplayer maps.

However, if you buy only RO2, you also get access to RS, BUT you can only play with rifleman class and you don't gain more level or weapons. Americans have semi-auto Garand in rifleman class but as a ""F2P"" player you can only play with inferior Springfield.

She also coaches cross country and track at the nearby high school.  My dad still holds his college record for the 400m hurdles. Yet despite this heritage, I have never understood the point of running, especially competitively.  When someone excitedly tells me they ran six miles today, my response is “Cool!  Where to?”  To me, it’s nothing more than a tiring way of getting somewhere fast or burning excess energy.

But somehow, for some reason, I ended up buying Mirror’s Edge.  I don’t know why, perhaps it was on sale.  Maybe it was because I heard the story was written by the daughter of Terry Pratchett, an excellent author.  Either way, when I started it up, I had no idea what to expect.  What I found was one of the most exhilarating games I’ve played in years… Eventually.

The first hour started out feeling like a trial of errors.  “My wallrun isn’t enough to cross this gap?”  I had to jump at the end to make it. “Come on!  I should have been able to grab that pipe!” I had to wait a little longer before leaping, for that extra distance.  “This guy kills me before I can get near him!”  Stop running directly at him, dummy. I finally quit in disgust after one cop kept on killing me while I was disarming his buddy.  

And there the game sat, for weeks.  Eventually though, I was bored one weekend and decided to give it another try, starting over from the beginning.  I had already solved everything before, so it was getting slightly tedious, until I reached one of the first tough spots in the game.  Once again, I couldn’t disarm one of the swat members without getting shot in the back.  But this time, I tried something wild and different.  I just *ran past him*.  I avoided him completely, clambering over a nearby fence, and just sprinting through areas where he could see me.  And that was when I finally “got” Mirror’s Edge, and when I understood the appeal of running in general. 

Before, I had come to it as a shooter with platforming elements.  Doom and Halo had ingrained the idea into my head that every enemy is an obstacle to defeat before progressing.  I’d run up to an enemy, disarm him, and then shoot his buddy before going on.  The gun controls were frusturating, and I hated having to leave behind a beloved shotgun just because I had to climb up a 6 foot ledge.  In fact, I would say giving the option to shoot enemies was one of the game’s largest failings, while being shot at is its greatest strength.

Those are my favorite parts of Mirror’s Edge:  The times where you’re running to a location and away from a deadly hail of lead.  The times where you’re being pursued by [spoilers], or dodging between gaps before a sniper draws a bead on you. Yes, the time trials are entertaining and it’s incredibly fun just finding elegant ways of getting from point A to point B.    But Mirror’s Edge really shines on your second playthrough, when you spurn guns and embrace speed.  Because that’s what Mirror’s Edge does best, raw speed.  It beats out every driving game at evoking the feeling of going fast, toeing the line between control and oblivion.  

---

**TL;DR**: Mirror’s edge is more about speed than any racing game, and emphasizes choice more than any Bioware RPG.  It’s not currently on sale, but you shouldn’t wait for one. Show that the game is being bought for what it is, not for what it’s priced.

I figured it was time for there to be one definite place for those curious about this series to go for their answers, so here it is.  

I will preface this by saying I am an avid fan of the series and it's plot.  **Also, the AC series is currently (as of the night of 8/23) on sale on Steam for very cheap, so if this convinces you to buy other games in the series, I would do it sooner rather than later.**

**Q - WHAT ONE AC GAME SHOULD I BUY IF I HAVENT PLAYED ANY YET?**

A - No brainer.  **Definitely Assassin's Creed 2.**  This is the game that truly brought the series into its own, and it also contains the vast majority of the important plot points of the series.  It is all around the best entry in the series thus far, and will go a long way towards your decisions about other games in the series.  It is easy to find for cheap, and on sale right now for $5.
  
**Q - SIB AC3 IF I HAVE NOT PLAYED ANY OTHER GAME IN THE SERIES?**

A - This is probably the most difficult question to answer, as it all depends on your preference in games on an individual basis, as well as how interested you are in the storyline of a game.  **If you are the kind of gamer who is looking at the commercials and just wants to be an assassin during the American Revolution, then yes, go ahead and grab the game when it gets out.**  Be forewarned, though, as there is an entire other side of the coin when it comes to the story in the form of Desmond Miles, and you will have no idea what is going on.  Also, since AC3 is meant to be the final game in the series which features Desmond, I would be surprised if the endgame were not focused on the ending of his story.

**Q - SIB BROTHERHOOD AND REVELATIONS IF I ONLY PLAYED ACII?**

A - Both of these games take what made ACII great and added on a few new bells and whistles each time.  **I would recommend at least playing Brotherhood as it's plot is much more important than that of Revelations, and it is a bit more polished as well.**  Again, one of the major factors in any decision about this series is how much you care about plot in gaming.  This is one of the few series where you can follow almost the entire life of a character (Ezio), and I find that to be one of the best parts of the series altogether.  The new items in Revelations (the Hookblade and Bombs) are interesting, as is the new setting, but the plot can be summarized very quickly if need be and it is not all that much different than its predecessor Brotherhood.

**Q - SIB THE ORIGINAL ASSASSIN'S CREED?**

A - It is hard to recommend the first game in this series simply because of how much better the rest of it is.  The combat feels much slower, moving around the world is more difficult, and the game grinds a bit towards the end.  **The only way I can really recommend it is if you want to know everything about the mythos of this game universe, as well as see how the series has evolved firsthand.**  It is by no means a bad game, and its setting in the Holy Land during the Crusades is a great one.  Still, this game is just the groundwork for the rest of the series and, like Revelations, its plot can be summarized relatively quickly.

**MY TWO CENTS**

I love this series.  It is one of my favorite of all time, and there are tons of factors that go into this.  First of all, **I am a history buff**, and any ""alternate history"" that is done well tends to pique my interest.  The intricacy of the plot, its characters and how they all fit into these historical eras has been a labor of love by the game's writers, and I for one truly appreciate that.  It has the potential to grab hold of you and never let go, and while I know it won't be the most important thing to everyone, it's the main reason I play.

I'm also a puzzle lover, so Glyph Hunting is worth mentioning as well.  **Glyph Hunting, its puzzles and the way it throws in figures from throughout history into the mythos, is probably my favorite part of the series overall.**  Glyphs are hidden symbols throughout ACII and Brotherhood that Desmond (as Ezio) must find to unlock more secrets behind the plot of the game, and while not necessary to finish the games, I absolutely love the hunt.  This is where the writing of the game broadens in context and mysteriousness, and I found myself playing the game more for the Glyphs than any other reason at many times.

More than anything, this game is about being a badass.  The world is your playground, with buildings to traverse as far as the eye can see and plenty of targets to take out.  **This series is very adaptive and lets you play it pretty much however you want, short of killing civilians.  That's GTA territory.**  Sure, there are missions that force you to play certain ways sometimes, but for most situations you can approach in many different fashions.  Sometimes, I want to sneak in with the crowd and silently poison the target before I get out.  Other times I want to throw my axe at him from a rooftop and just bolt.  Maybe I'll take a huge sword and run straight up to the target and his guards next time.  The choice is all yours.

The settings that the series takes you through are nothing short of fantastic.  **From Jerusalem to Rome, the world of the AC universe is beautiful, diverse and very alive.**  I am personally a little biased by this as I had just finished a major photography class that took me through much of Italy just as this series hit it's stride, but get high up on the rooftops of Rome in Brotherhood and tell me this series isn't gorgeous - And you can traverse almost all of it.

I should also add that the soundtrack for this series has been astounding.  **Jesper Kyd is one of the top game composers out there today, and this series' soundtrack is his crown jewel.**  I have all of the soundtracks from the series and play selections from them surprisingly often.  You'll find yourself humming tunes from this series, I promise that.

This series has evolved wonderfully as it has progressed.  ACIII looks to be the best in the series, but that does not mean you should ignore its previous chapters.  They are each unique and memorable in their own way, and in my opinion, **this series just wouldn't be the same, nor would it mean the same to me, if I hadn't experienced it in its entirety.**

""Gordon Freeman! It really *is* you! \**swoon*\*""

""Humanity needs a hero. And Shepard's the best we've got!""

Hero Fatigue: I'm talking about the way every game seems to be hell bent on giving you an emotional reach-around. You're always the most important person in the story. You're always pivotal. The universe always revolves around you. You are always some insane psycho super soldier who can manage to kill thousands of people.

It's great in a vacuum. Importance adds drama, tension and scale. But you don't play games in a vacuum, and after all this time I'm getting mighty sick of being the universe's only hope, the only thing standing between humanity and utter des--- snnnoore. The drama well on that topic has, at least for me, run dry. I feel coddled, especially in some more linear games of late where they *really* want you to play the game their way (In Max Payne 3, if you don't keep moving fast enough a voice over from Max will spout a condescending phrase about how this room doesn't hold anything of interest).

I want to play games with more personal stories. Morrowind, before you become famous and when everyone thinks you're junk. Half-life 1, when you're just a random scientist trying to escape and before everyone has decided (arbitrarily) that you're the second coming. Oblivion before... well... the 30 seconds that exists before Picard decides you're *to die for* (spoiler (not really)).

Imagine a Mass Effect where, instead of playing Shepard pretending you're The Avengers in sppppaaaaace, you play a someone unimportant, but is still affected by the story at large. Who, get this, *doesn't* get caught up in a cross-planetary plot to destroy the world, and is the only one who can stop it before it's too late. A farmer who is displaced by the war. A young street kid who is stealing to stay alive and is trying to find their place in the world. A son / daughter who stops getting letters from their soldier father and packs up everything they have to go look for them. Or a family who are on a planet invaded by geth / those time dudes whose name I forget and have to escape cross country to another space port in an attempt to escape.

Or even better, those examples in a universe far less polemic than Mass Effect's, where you could truly say that good / evil is just a matter of opinion. 

I'm interested in personal stories. In people that matter *to other people*. You don't have to save the world to do something that matters. The games I play don't seem to understand that.

(worth mentioning, I only have a PC, so console games are out sorry, though I'm considering buying a PS3 later in the year as there is a bit of a backlog of exclusives I'd like to have a go at)

(also worth mentioning again, I'm not bashing every game where you play a hero. I'm just looking for a bit of variety)

I'll go through some of my biggest reasons to buy this :)

* This game is awesome if you love '80s themed stuff. Seriously. The music, the graphics, and everything else about the game just screams '80s! There are lots of funny 16-bit style cutscenes, complete with montages and hilarious b-movie style over-acting. 
* The game also looks really beautiful, thanks to it using Far Cry 3's game engine. Most of the game also looks a lot like something from the TRON universe, which has a really colorful and futuristic aesthetic that I love.
* Like I hinted at before, this game is hilarious, and doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest. There's a TON of quality humor packed into this game at every point. Even the tutorial and the game's loading screens openly mock themselves! Everything about Blood Dragon is very tongue-in-cheek, and it fully embraces the cheesy, '80s b-movie style atmosphere, complete with cyber commandos attempting to thwart hilariously over the top villains aspiring towards world domination and incredibly campy love interests.
* The weapons in Blood Dragon are AWESOME. Throughout the game, you're going to go crazy with futuristic gatling guns, flamethrowers, high caliber sniper rifles that literally SHOOT EXPLOSIONS, and an EXTREMELY high-powered laser called the *Kill Star* that is seriously a contender for my top video game weapon of all time.

I really recommend you pick up Blood Dragon. Quite honestly, it's a steal for $15, especially if you're into other '80s themed games like Hotline Miami, or if you were a big fan of Far Cry 3. **[If you want to know more about the game, I also made a video review on youtube, which I recommend you give a look and let me know what you think :) http://youtu.be/SaS0GcC_JvY](http://youtu.be/SaS0GcC_JvY)**",[Any],False,,t5_2ud8h,1367470442.0,,,True,t3_1dimsx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dimsx/ysb_far_cry_3_blood_dragon/,

This game is seriously addicting. The RNG component can be against you, but that's what makes this game ridiculously fun. A few reasons to buy it


**1) Toughness.** If you make it even to the last stage your first try, you were either a) very lucky, or b) familiar with rogue-type games. 

**2) Replayability.** Beat the last boss? Oh good, now go back and unlock the other 8 ships. Finally got all 8 ships? Now go and complete their individual achievements until you unlock their other layouts (same ship, new design, new components)

**3) Flexibility.** Having tough luck with weapons? Buy some drones to protect your ship while demolishing theirs. Drones don't do it for you? Why not get a teleporter and beam onto their ship, killing their crew. You play your way.

**4) RNG.** Yes, the RNG component can be *very* frustrating. But that's half the fun. Learn to roll with the RNG and celebrate your victories while weeping over your consecutive 5 blaster misses. Overcoming the RNG makes beating the final boss that much sweeter.


I bought the game on Dec 27 during the Steam sale. I'm definitely a casual gamer, and I've already put 47 hours into it. If you like rogue-type games and want a challenge, give FTL a try.

**What Is Crusader Kings 2**

Crusader Kings 2 (CK2) is the latest Grand Strategy title released by publisher and developer [Paradox Interactive](http://www.paradoxplaza.com/). The company itself is full swing in their transition from being an indie developer studio to a full blown publishing company and developer studio. They are a Swedish based company who has been in the business for over a decade. CK2 is not their first rodeo and they have improved vastly on their previous titles (including the first Crusader Kings) to bring this amazing product that has continued to evolve with each patch and DLC.

The game itself was released earlier this year (2012) and was a hit from the start. The engine and visuals were vastly improved on from their last Grand Strategy title, Victoria 2. My personal opinion is that the company has four main titles that make up their Grand Strategy ""series"". In order of time period focus, the (most recent) games would be Crusader Kings 2 -&gt; Europa Univeralis 3 -&gt; Victoria 2 -&gt; Hearts of Iron III. The overall consensus is that EU3 is the strongest of the four titles but is also the oldest. CK2 is the newest and with that has the benefit of a newer engine, improved graphics, and more well thought out and optimized gameplay mechanics.

Now what exactly is Crusader Kings? The short answer is that it is a simulation of Late Medieval politics. However, this game is nothing close to simple. In fact, it may be one of the most complex and intricate games you will ever play (provided you do not play HoI3 because that game confuses me to no ends). I will not gloss over this, learning this game will be difficult. You will not be able to sit down your first time playing and walk away understanding everything. It will take you time to learn how to play and it may become frustrating at times. I will expand more on this later.

Now for the long answer as to what is the Crusader Kings 2 game. This is more accurately a simulation of dynasty building as well as medieval politicking. What does that mean exactly? For those who are not as familiar with the age of knights and kings, most, if not all, of Europe and the surrounding area was ruled by families, called a dynasty. You may have heard of some famous dynasties and not have known it such as the von Habsburgs of Austria or the Capetians of France (for those more familiar with English history, the Plantagenets from England is an example as well). Think of a dynasty as everyone with the same last name, or your family with the same last name. This is how people distinguished themselves in the medieval times. One could be German or English or French but they were also a Salian or von Luxemburg, etc. A child took the dynasty name of their father. Why do you care about this? Because when you play CK2, you are not playing as a nation or king or knight, you are playing as one of the dynasties of medieval Europe. You will live and die as your dynasty does and your only goal to continue playing is to make sure your dynasty remains in power and does not die out (or lose all their titles). Seem easy enough? Perhaps if you are an Irish Duke, but say you are the Cid trying to unite all of Iberia? I do not think your Muslim and Catholic neighbors would appreciate that too much.

So Izual, I am still confused as to what you are saying I do when I play. Let me expand a little. You start a game by choosing to play as a Count, Duke, King, or Emperor somewhere in Europe/Eastern Asia/Northern Africa. (You can purchase extra DLC to play as a Muslim ruler or to expand the Orthodox Byzantium Empire gameplay even though they are playable in the vanilla game). The character you choose will hold any number of things called Titles. Titles are rights to land or rights to vassals. The lowest type of Titles is that of Baronies. A Barony is a single castle in a specific province. The lowest Title allowed to prevent a game over for any human player is that of a Count. When you hold the title of Count, it means you control all the vassals (which would include Barons, Bishops, and Mayors) in that province. So if I have the Title that is Count of Ile de France then one of my controlled vassals will be the City of Paris. If you lose all of your Count and higher titles (or your entire family dies off) then you will receive a game over. The next tier of titles is that of Duke. A Duchy will be in control of a group of de jure Counties. What does de jure mean? There are two terms that are couples: de jure and de facto. De jure basically means what history says belongs to this and de facto means what currently belongs to this. So Ile de France would be de jure to the Duchy of Valois but may be de facto to the Duchy of Normandy if the Duke of Normandy holds the Title of Count of Ile de France. The next tier of titles is that of King. A Kingdom consist of a group of Duchies. What's a King to a God? Well hold on there is still a fourth title tier in between there, that of Emperor. An Empire consists of Kingdoms (though the Kingdoms do not need to exist for the Empire to exist, this means most Empires in the game will only contain Duchies). Your character can hold any number of these titles with benefits and down sides for having too many or too few (and none at all resulting in a game over).

Okay, now I am just confused. You explained dynasties and Titles. What does it mean? This is exactly how the game represents the Feudal System which is what fueled both the Late Medieval Era and this game. Your baseline goal is to keep your dynasty alive and holding titles. If you do not satisfy both, you receive a game over. Other than that, this is a sandbox game. You decide what you want to do! There is no way to win the game. This may be both good and bad for you depending on your personality and the type of games you like. But it leads to some long hours and strategizing and emotion. You may decide to start as the Duke of York and try to claim the Kingdom of England as yours or start as the King of Denmark and try and force your Scandinavian neighbors into the historical Kalmar Union. There is no lack of characters to start as and things to do. And once you hit start, anything can happen (for better or worse).

You begin as a single character who controls one of the aforementioned Titles as their primary and any given secondary Titles. As your character you can do things such as get married, have children, raise your children, kill your children, get divorced, get married again, kill your spouse, raise an army, etc. The game consists of many, many characters. Each character has a relationship counter linked to every other character in the game. This represents their opinion of that character and can determine how the AI will act towards that character. If the Duke of Bohemia has a -75 relationship counter with the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire then he may decide to revolt or not pass a piece of legislation when asked. Whereas, if the Duke of Lower Lorraine has a +50 relationship with the same Holy Roman Emperor then he may decide to raise his troops in defense of the empire when Bohemia decides to rebel. This is only some of the military effects of relationships, but there are a vast number of other lesser violent ways characters can interact (including murder, taxes, prestige, etc.) You as the player will have to balance you relationships with both your neighbors and your vassals (for those who do not know a vassal is someone who calls you lord). Each character has their own ideas and goals (whether they are a human player or AI) and will either use you or be used by you to achieve them. This leads to some intricate political webs formed by the game when you play. This is where the fun comes from. You may find yourself at arms with a stalwart ally only to be years later backstabbed by that same ally for some piece of land you hold. The story lines you create are endless.

So what makes each character different? Why not the traits they each hold! What exactly makes you different from I? I may be Patient where you are Proud. There are a good deal of different traits that any character can hold that determines their in game ""personality"". Each trait has a set of benefits to the characters abilities to perform specific and macro actions (such as a character being Brave will lead them to be a better battlefield commander) as well as determine how other characters perceive the first (so two Honest characters may enjoy each others company but no one likes a Cynic). As I said before, these traits will determine how the character acts as well. The simplest example is that a vassal who is Ambitious is more likely to rebel against you.

What else is there besides schemes and politics? I thought the Medieval times were all about knights and armies? Of course they are! And of course you have an army! As a lord, you have access to three types of armies. Your own personal levies (a levy is the amount of men you can muster in your land to fight for you; so an army), the levies of your vassals (if they will let you use them), and mercenaries for hire (provided you have the gold) (there are also a fourth type called retinues, which is a standing army, that you can use if you buy one of the DLC). What do you do with your armies? Fight with them of course! When pen and paper cannot accomplish your goal then swords and arrows always can. Now, the army approach of this game is more a macro standpoint where you will have control over the composition, technology, and commanders of each army but you cannot control the actual fighting. You move your army to a specific province and if an enemy army is there then battle will commence. When one army is defeated it will retreat to a neighboring province. Armies will not replenish so you will have to re-raise your levies if you want to muster more forces after a defeat.

This is a lot of information. I know. This game is not a walk in the park. It is fun, but you will have to work for it some. That work is learning the game. Once you have it learned it will be hours upon hours of fun. Each campaign can takes weeks or months to complete and no two campaigns are the same, ever. I apologize for explaining so much of the mechanics but I find that it is necessary to understand what exactly the game is. If I was unclear before, the game is played like a board game. You look at a map of Europe and control everything from there.

Eventually, your starting character will die (as all men must die). What now? Hopefully, you have an heir to your Titles. If you do, you will take over and now play as your heir. This is an interesting aspect of the game as your heir is a completely different character from your previous character. You can only control them so much while you are still playing your first, you do not have direct control over them until you die. This means they may (and will) do things you do not want them to do. You have to balance this and try to steer them in a certain direction (if you want). Once your current character dies you will then play as them, meaning you will get full control of that character and then be able to do as you will. There are laws that you can pass or revoke that will determine who will be your heir (your brother, your oldest son, your oldest daughter, etc.).

How mad would you be if I told you I just lied to you. You will not always play as your heir. You will only play as your heir if your heir is of your dynasty. What does this mean exactly? You want to make sure you keep your dynasty in place to inherit you every time. Otherwise you will be losing Titles and possibly receiving a game over. How exactly could someone not of my dynasty be my heir? Two simple answers are if you have no children or if you have Elective Succession Laws and the electors have chosen someone who is not of your dynasty. There are other possible ways that you will always have to be wary of.

Well, that concludes the majority of what I wanted to explain about how the game plays. As I keep saying, I know it was a lot. Let me take a step back and continue with some more meta game aspects. When you start a campaign you can choose any starting date from the start of the Norman Invasion to ~Fall of the Byzantine Empire. I apologize for not having the exact dates on hand at the moment. You can play as any Christian lord (which includes Orthodox). With DLC you can unlock the ability to play as Muslim rulers. You cannot play as Pagans (ie the Norse of northern Sweden) or Merchant Republics (ie Duchy of Genoa) or Theocracies (ie the Pope).

* Sandbox-like gameplay where there is no direct way to play and no proper way to win. You decide yourself what you want to do and how to do it.

* True dynamic gameplay where no two gameplay sessions will be the same.

* Extreme historical accuracy for starting characters and nations as well as family trees.

* Very moddable.

-----

**Cons**

* No direct control over battles.

* No naval battles.

* Uninteresting types of government that are currently unplayable.

* Steep learning curve.

-----

**Mods and A Game of Thrones**

This game, as all Paradox games, has a great deal of support for modders and all things user created. I myself had delved into some modding of the game to tailor it to my own pleasure. Fortunately for everyone else, there is a vast modding community affiliated to the game that has made many, many mods. You can find these on the official Paradox forums for the game.

One mod that stands out from the rest (and is so well done that Paradox developers have included updates specifically to benefit the mod team working on the project) is that of the A Game of Thrones mod. You can find the mod stickied on the mod forum for CK2 at the Paradox forums.

This mod is an overhaul of the vanilla game to implement Westeros and all the factions involved there. The politicking involved in the ASoIaF works perfectly with the CK2 engine and game mechanics. You can play as any of the lords during many different time periods including Robert's Rebellion, the War of Five Kings and even the time of Aegon the Conqueror. The mod itself simulates the form of rebellions with their ""Megawar"" system that allows everyone in the Seven Kingdoms to declare for which side of a war they want. If you are a fan of the books or TV series, this is the game that best represents the world. There are plenty of people who have purchased CK2 solely to play this mod. You will not be disappointed.

-----

And with that, I will conclude my YSB for Crusader Kings 2. I hope I have said enough (and not too much) to recommend this game to you and hope those of you interested will try it. I will conclude with one of my probably most important points of this post: this game goes on sale frequently, most frequent on Steam. So keep your eyes open if you want to find this for a discount! You will have hours of fun on your hands!

Terraria is a great game. I saw in another post someone describe it as Minecraft meets Castlevania, and I think that hits the nail right on the head. Gameplay is balanced between day and night. Above ground, you have all day to construct whatever your heart desires with various blocks and items mined and gathered around your game world, and explore explore explore. When the sun goes down, waves of monsters begin attacking. There is also a great deal of exploration with various biomes, and you can go deep into the bowels of the ""earth"" or far into the cloudy sky. There are tons of items and resources and things to discover, and each game world is generated procedurally, so there is a lot of variety and depth the deeper you dig. And the graphics delightful 8-bit renderings, so anyone who calls things ""retro"" (tsk tsk) will enjoy that as well.

All this and I haven't even mentioned the best part - coop. This game is best with other people helping you build and explore.

At $2.49, this game is a STEAL! So go out and buy it, and PM me for my steam id if you want to play some coop.",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,bronze,True,t3_172ijs,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/172ijs/ysb_terraria_steam/,

Rather than using the played-to-death birds eye view/strategy game format, Awesomenauts adapts a 2d side-scroller approach.

The overall game is much simpler than DotA clones, and has a MUCH better community. The learning curve is not as harsh, but the game still allows for high levels of play.

Money (Solar) and Experience now become the same thing. Every 100 Solar, your character progresses a level.

Unlike DotA, where you must pick one skill every level, all abilities are purchased through the shop.

As you playmore, and rank up higher, you unlock new characters and abilities for existing characters. This is both positive and negative.

While this provides incentives to continually play the game, this creates an uneven playing field for newer players. With less options, a player simply has less potential.

However, the unlocks are not significantly more powerful than the starting abilities, and gradually giving the player more abilities slowly allows them to test out builds without being overwhelmed.

The overall balance between characters is surprisingly good for such a casual game. While I personally believe one or two characters are a bit overpowered, there is nothing game-breaking about these characters. For a new company like Ronimo Games to do such a great job balancing the game right off the bat is impressive.

Overall its a very good game, and currently its less  than $4.00 on steam.",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,,True,t3_15ga0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/15ga0f/ysb_awesomenauts_pc/,

Why?

First of all, this game is like NEVER on sale, it has been on sale recently, but before that I've never seen this game anywhere besides on Steam for 20€, which for a game that was released in 2004 is freaking too much. That's when it comes to cost.

The game is set in modern times, it follows pretty closely this whole vampire the masquerade rpg thing. There are many paths you can take while playing the game starting with persuasion, seduction, walking in stealth, killing everything in sight, etc. If you pick your character as a vampire from the nosferatu clan (the only clan that doesn't allow you to walk the streets freely due to you being deformed and pretty much ugly), you gotta move via sewers to actually get somewhere. Basically, this game has this depth that you cannot find in other games now. You can progress through the entire game (almost) with your manipulation and persuasion feats (it's possible although not recommended by me - boss encounters are tragically tough). Also, you dont need to beat the previous game (Redemption) I for one skipped it entirely, and I can tell you that I don't think I missed anything, but well someone who actually beat it can prove otherwise!


Flaws: yeah this game had a lot of flaws back in 2004. At some point I think you even couldn't complete the game if you did something. Now as far as I remember there are 2 ways you can go after downloading the game. You can either go with official patches that will fix majority of the bugs for you, or you can go with fanmade patch that will add some things (cut content to some extent, bug fixes etc.) but will be less official (I had some dialogue issues (no sound)). So choice is yours, but I strongly recommend getting this game if you like being a  manly badass vampire.

It is $7.50 for the community choice sale right now and that is an absolute steal for such a fun game.

I bought this game on Xbox 360 when it was released and then again awhile later when it was ported to PC.  The PC port is one of the best (if not THE best) PC port I have ever played. It works perfectly, has plenty of options, and looks absolutely great graphics-wise.

The game play is unlike any other game I have played in terms of a game bringing a new concept to the table but not straying too far from what people are used to.

The story is really engaging and keeps you wanting to know what is next.

If you have any questions post them and I will try to respond. It pretty much boils down to fun, fresh, engaging story, amazing PC port, and great price for the amount of content you get. If you had any thought as to whether you should or shouldn't buy this game, well you should.

I do however caution that before you think about introducing someone to gaming, you’re sure they’re open to it and that you aren’t forcing it upon them.  Different people can have different tastes after all,  but that being said, Im confident in my choice(s).  **My primary goal here is to get someone comfortable with gaming.**  This is also my experience and I realize it may not be for everyone, but overall I'd had very good results.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First some background. (skip to **L.A. Noire** if you just want to know why I suggest it.)

**The 2 biggest problems with getting newcomers interested in games**

 * Controls
 * Story

**Controls**

I can’t count the number of times I’ve played a game and thought, “that was a great story, why wouldn’t anyone enjoy this game”.  To me games have always been interactive stories.  Unfortunately the controls that enable interactivity are the largest barrier to newcomers.  I see **Portal 2** recommended a lot for co-op and my first thought is that it's not the best choice for a new gamer.  The concept of portals alone is too abstract for some to tackle while they're trying to learn game controls at the same time. **In my opinion, a good game to introduce someone to gaming with will let them work out the controls at their own pace, without putting too much pressure on them to execute perfectly.**   It used to be a lot easier back when everything was 2D.  With the shift to 3d and dual analog sticks, gaming for a newcomer looks increasingly daunting.    However, the shift to 3D games can allow for some better story telling which leads me to the second point.

**Story**

Sure you don’t always need a story, some of us take pride in our skill and the achievement of a high score is enough.  But if that isn’t you, it’s probably the story that keeps you going.  Most new gamers don’t care about high scores or kill streaks, therefore it’s up to the story to keep them engaged.  However, as with any media, certain genres of fiction don’t appeal to the masses (ie Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy).  **In my opinion, the story must be easily accessible to anyone not acquainted with a particular genre**.  Therefore your best bet is a reality based game since it’s the easiest for someone to relate to.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**LA Noire**

**LA Noire** is a great game to start out with. Nearly everyone enjoys a good mystery and LA Noire is a detective story, set in a recreated post WWII Los Angeles with real historic locations and streets.   You start out as a street cop, and move onto a detective investigating murders, arson, drugs, etc…  Additionally all of the characters are portrayed by real life actors using facial recognition technology (a bonus if you watch a lot of TV).

Control wise, the game is in 3rd person, basically like GTA, but because it’s a detective story you need to search for clues.  This is a good way to get someone used to the controls since there’s no time pressure to  find them and you’re able to take your time walking around.  Finding clues isn’t too difficult as there’s an audio cue when you’re near one.  Additionally there is an incentive to be methodical and thorough when searching for clue because you’ll need them later to interrogate suspects.

There are also shooting an driving sequences but I recommend that the more experienced gamer takes on the shooting parts since they require a bit of skill, and it’s possible to die or fail during these portions.

However, it’s the interrogation scenes that drive this game.  Much like in real life, you’ll need to pay attention to the facial expressions of the interviewees.  The facial recognition technology really allows people to appear nervous, angry, scared, etc…  You’ll be given a choice to accept a statement as truth, lie, or doubt.  As mentioned earlier, when doubting a person’s statement, you need evidence of your doubt so you will be rewarded for finding all of the clues at a crime scene.   New players seem to enjoy this part of the game as you don’t need to be a gamer to interpret someone’s story.  Additionally, when you correctly assess a statement you’re rewarded with more backstory about a particular crime.  This incentivizes many to replay missions or get a perfect score to reveal the whole story.

Some of you might find the pace of LA Noire a little slow.  Admittedly I will also concede that the story does get a little boring around the Arson chapters.  However, keeping in mind that this experience isn’t just for you, but also for your spouse/friend, I find it has enough to offer for the both of you to have an enjoyable experience.

**You mentioned other suggestions?**

Unfortunately my other two suggestions are only for the Playstaton 3.  Additionally I recommend you play these **AFTER** you give **LA Noire** a go.  However, if you ever get a PS3 I am confident the following will continue to capture their attention as I’ve had personal experience playing both games multiple times with non-gamers with positive results every time. 

 * **Heavy Rain**
 * **Uncharted Series**

**Heavy Rain**. 

I frequently recommend this game to people because its a one of a kind experience. The game is a mix of interactive events and cutscenes. The main story is a suspense/thriller/mystery involving the kidnapping of the main character's son. You alternate between 4 separate characters as the story develops. A Father, a Detective, a Journalist, and an FBI agent. For the most part you can move at your own pace, the fast paced portions of the game are limited to pushing the right button combinations or directions.
I fully suggest you pick 2 characters, and let your friend/spouse play 2 characters. No matter what happens, the story continues and the ending changes depending on your choices. Yes a character can die at certain points, but the death will be written into the outcome. Let them know that there's no pressure to be perfect as deaths are required to get every ending.

**Uncharted Series**

You might want to start out with Uncharted 2 or 3 as they gameplay mechanics are greatly improved. The stories are a great mix of action and historical fiction. Think of them as a cross between Indiana Jones and National Treasure movies.

I would suggest you do all the shooting portions, and let your friend/spouse do all of the platforming and puzzle portions. The platforming is surprisingly forgiving and you aren't required to make perfect jumps to grab onto ledges. The puzzles aren’t overly difficult either.  The games are fairly good at alternating between shooting, platforming and puzzle sections so if you're taking turns, no one is bored for too long. Additionally you'll root for each other to advance the story.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And there you have it, using these 3 games I was able to watch a non-gamer female attorney go from being scared to pick up a controller, to playing through entire chapters of Uncharted (on easy, but hey that's not bad either!) in a few months.  Hopefully my suggestions will work out just as well for you as they did for me.

Does this game cost alot to get the good items? E.g. Do i have to pay for the good items or else have to play for weeks to get that good set of armour? 

Does the game have a good level of character class/customisation/variton of gameplay/races to play?

First off, I wanna say how thankful I am for each and every one of you for making this subreddit such a success for us on the mod team and for you guys the users. Keep on posting!

----

Moving on, we're going to be adding a rule that is something that in the past seemed like common knowledge but it has gotten to a point where we need to set in stone a rule about it. The rule is as follows:

&gt; You may not suggest in any way to illegally obtain a game. While we do not care to ply into your own personal decision, we will not allow you to tell others to torrent, pirate, or in any other way get a hold of a game without legal consent of the producer. This goes for both comments and posts.

While this rule will not effect the majority of you, this rule will still be enforced. This is not saying that you are not allowed to pirate the games, just that you do not advertise that you are doing so here. This includes situations where someone may suggest to pirate a game to test it before buying it; while the intentions are for good, the valid substitute is to make a 'SIB' thread on that game to figure out whether or not you're going to buy it.

----

In other news, we're most likely going to be trying to get a monthly contest up and running with real prizes! This is still in circulation and nothing has been confirmed yet, but get ready for something new and exciting soon!

The premise of the game starts out as, you are Wilson. You've been transported to some wilderness world by a demon where crazy things occur. Your job is to survive as best you can for as long as you can.

Now, the game right now is in beta mode, but believe me when I tell you it is very playable and enjoyable until you figure out methods that keep you alive and allow you to explore as much as you want. The devs have talked about this and are actually figuring out ways to balance this unintentional exploit.

Once the game starts, you spawn in a starting area. You look for berries, twigs, grass, flint, you can make an axe when you have enough material, to chop wood. Come nightfall you need to make a fire or you **die.** No questions asked. If you don't make a fire at night something unexpected will kill you. 

**PROS:** 

* Unlockable characters

* Challenging gameplay

* Devs listen to suggestions and feedback

* Devs openly tell you where the game is [headed](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/showthread.php?2832-Don-t-Starve-Roadmap)

* If you buy the game off Klei's website, you get 2 Steam keys, and 2 google chrome keys [here](http://www.dontstarvegame.com/blog/getting-started/).

* I just want to add: previous games from Klei include Eets, Shank, and more recently Mark of the Ninja. If you enjoyed any of those, you should definitely give Don't Starve some attention (that's actually what piqued my interest in it in the first place). -Xylobe

**CONS:**

* No multiplayer  **EDIT**: ""After reading about that on the forums it seems like their reasoning is that adding multiplayer to a game increases the cost more than players believe. Players are 'spoiled' with multiplayer and don't realize the cost, and they figure they won't be able to meet that cost. Also the game at this point is heavily designed around singleplayer. The changes that would have to be done to make a good shift to multiplayer are probably beyond me at this point."" -PrinceofIce

* Death is very unnerving because you have to start over, but you keep the recipes for researched items. (You can make them again without researching them).

* Deaths can be very unexpected and has made me throw my arms in the air yelling wtf multiple times.

* Currently, if you find a survival method that works, there really isn't anything challenging.

Bottom line: I highly recommend this great indie game. The expected due date is March 2013, and I have posted a link above about where the devs are headed with this but I'll post it again [here](http://forums.kleientertainment.com/showthread.php?2832-Don-t-Starve-Roadmap).

If you're lazy and you don't want to read all of this, skip to the ""SKIP TO HERE""

Let me start off by saying this, if you're a big fan of MMORPG's, you should already know that Guild Wars 2 is one of the most, if not THE most, anticipated MMO's of all time. Since Arena Net announced they were making GW2, it has been under a very strict ""we'll release it when it's done"" policy. Some people may say ""BOO I WANNA PLAY IT NOW"", but just wait and think about it for a second. This is one of the most anticipated games of all times, why would you want them to release it while it's half glitchy? All you're going to do then is complain about how much of a failure it was and blah blah blah. Let the good people finish making the game so that you can see more pros than cons. 

GRAPHICS: Damn good. Some people say its nothing close to Skyrim on high graphics. I say the graphics are just as good as they need to be. If you keep reading this post, you'll see later why you're not going to worry about the graphics during gameplay.

GAMEPLAY (combat): Extremely hard to compare to any other games. GW2 gives you freedom of movement and the ability to use your skill how you please, when you please. If you've played WoW, you know that when a monster casts a spell on you (ie a simple fire bolt) the spell locks on to you and the spell is going to follow your character until it hits you (aside from the blocking, deflecting stuff. I'm talking about the actual animation). GW2 combat is NOTHING like that. Say a monster is about the smash the ground. You can dodge out of the way (yes, you can roll to dodge and jump around) or do something crazy like if you're a warrior, you can leap to a nearby enemy so that you not only dodge the smash but you also damage another enemy. Another example: say a monster is throwing a rock at you and you're playing a mesmer (a class in the game, probably the most OP one), you can dodge the rock by using a skill that leaves a clone of you where you're standing and teleports you to the enemy. Or if the enemy is smashing the ground, you can use another skill which makes you stand where you are and teleports your clone to the enemy and then you can blow up your clone for AoE damage. The skills are responsive and the way skills are set up are unlike any other game (you'll see why later). And check this out, skills actually work together, as you'll see in the video. 

GAMEPLAY (leveling): This is where I fell in love with GW2. ""Thats insane! Leveling are grinding are the most boring part in any game!"". Wrong. First of all, since level one (yes that means right after you hit the ""create character"" button) you can level your character all they way to max level doing NOTHING other than PvP. Aside from that, there are quests and parties. GW2 is an extremely social game and believe it or not, the fastest way to level is to be more social! It's like the game is making you more of a normal person than an anti-social gamer xP! Say you're walking around (like I was in the swamp doing a quest). All of a sudden, a raid boss pops up out of nowhere! You just say where in the zone chat and all of a sudden an entire army of players shows up to kill the beast. The best part is, you don't have to be in a party to help kill it. You gain exp, money AND items based on how much you committed to killing it! Events like these are not rare what so ever. No matter where you go, events are there and they're the easiest way to level. Even if the event fails, you get exp and money for trying!!

GAMEPLAY (PvP): Holy. Crap. GW2 is a PvP oriented game. So insanely PvP oriented that war is 24/7/365. And not only 5v5 or 10v10 or 100v100. GW2 puts 3 worlds (3 ENTIRE WORLDS) against each other AT THE SAME TIME. Spells everywhere! Assassins everywhere! People in giant siege robots breaking down armoured walls and invading castles everywhere! And If you're realm is winning the war, your ENTIRE realm gets boosts. It's hilarious when 2 armies are staring each other down, waiting for the other to start a fight. All of a sudden, a tank run out balls blazing and starts a gigantic war. LEERROYYYYYYY!

I could keep going on about the pros about this game but at this point you're probably wondering so what are the cons then?? You won't believe how long it took me to think of what people would consider cons:

Low graphics compared to Skyrim
You can't fly 
There are no mounts (yet)
Combat can be tricky to master if you're not used to dodging skills 
Sometimes you die very easily (luckily, every character comes with minimum 1 self heal and when the ""die"", before they actually die, they go into this ""struggle for life"" thing, where any player can walk up to them and start healing them to bring them back to their feet. Yes, you do get credit for helping them like exp and stuff)
Some people can be real jerks and let you die or leave you to do an event on your own
You can't pick 2 classes like in the other GW ( but you can combine/change skills via using certain weapons )

SKIP TO HERE: So enough talking, just watch this video and you'll know if this game is for you. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBC_ig73aMs

The game costs 60 USD for just the game and can be pre-ordered now. If you pre-order from the GW2 website, you get a 3 day head start and a special item! Also, you get to play in the beta this weekend which will probably be the last one before release! 

YES THE LAUNCH DATE IS FINAL! 8.28.2012! ONE MONTH!

See you on the battlefield!

Yes, you should buy Shadowrun Returns. If you're into RPG's or tactical turn-based strategy in the *slightest* then this will give you a solid 12-18 hours of awesome. [I did a first impressions video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YINg7yv29I&amp;feature=c4-overview&amp;list=UUMGVp_GnkhHZROIfRdXpo4Q) that goes into all the details over footage if you want the super nitty gritty. 

I've heard lots of people comparing the combat to XCom, and it does resemble a simplified version of that. In my opinion it's clearer about communicating cover and easier to learn because of the fixed isometric angle. The first thing the combat reminded me of was playing a pen and paper rpg with the movement squares, pieces on a board, everything. 

You have a ton of freedom over how to build your character- you can choose to work within a preconceived archetype or design one of your own. 

The story is absolutely wonderful, and the writing is awesome. There is a ton of text in this game- if you don't want to read you'll miss a lot of what makes it great. The environments are both gorgeous and intriguing. The only real major complaint I have is that there are only autosaves, (no manual save) and they're spaced out a fair bit. Prepare to marathon this one. 

Best of all, there's a level creator available which means tons of user-created content. The campaign is a good length but it's by no means all there is. 

TL;DR: Get it unless you're really not into stories/roleplaying. ",,False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,,True,t3_1j58qn,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1j58qn/ysb_shadowrun_returns/,

I like permadeath, roguelikes and that sort of thing, I like strategic combat and Star Trek. I was wondering if you think I should buy it, as it is very cheap, but to be honest, I have bought cheap things and been severely disappointed by them, because I had not been recommended or had it reviewed by anyone.(Shortly after I came out of living under a rock, I bought DN:F.

But Walking Dead is different. 

If you've read the books or watched the tv series, the Walking Dead is not about zombies. It's about what happens to the people and society under collapse. It's about the character transformations, and the hard decisions made to survive. 

This game is closer to the books than the tv show, but honestly you don't need to have read/watched either medium. This game, much like the other two versions of the Walking Dead, exists and succeeds on its own merit. It has a couple character crossovers, but nothing that requires dedication to the book or tv. 

This game has made me cry. 

This game made me accept that there could be a likable, deep character that is a child. 

I don't want to overhype this game. and I probably am. But I am not exaggerating when I say that this has an emotional impact worth the price (10 dollars until thursday on Steam).

But most important of all: **I am talking about** *The Walking Dead* **NOT** *The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct*. 

and on a side note, the graphic novels are awesome. Compediums 1+2 are available at some libraries.

EDIT: By some definitions, this is not a game. It is an emotional experience. It is not as interactive as some would like. But if you like story, and getting emotions from games, or just a fan of the Walking Dead, this is a must.

Basically what I'm after is a sort of game where you're building up your city or empire without it just basically pushing anything military to the front while neglecting everything else. I have Civ 5 and I love it, but it suffers from this when I'm feeling in the mood for something less military focused. Yes, I know you can play it without being military focused and realistically you WOULD need a strong military no matter what, but my point is that it feels like this is the biggest thing to do in game while city management is kind of a lesser issue.

Dwarf Fortress style(in how it works; I don't mean ASCII or Rogue-like style) might be more the thing I'm looking for, but unfortunately I can't stand the UI of the game as well as the learning curve for the *fun*. I'd also prefer something on a larger scale than just a single mountain(again, I'm aware of how the game works and that you can get large areas to call your own, but I'm hoping you all get my point).

I suppose I'm asking for a game that has each citizen, or at least each building/business/whatever be as integral as each soldier. Games that might require many stages of productions in things(something like maybe to feed your city you need bread, but for bread you need wheat, but for wheat you need etc etc etc). Large scale ones would probably be the most interesting to me, possibly even world-wide, but something a bit smaller would be fun, too.

Is there anything like this out there, or are my choices basically nil from the various things I'm asking for?

**Look out for:**

* Torchlight 2 - This games ia amazing, if it's in the $10 range get it, if not still get it.

* Garrys Mod &amp;amp; CSS bundle - This has been in every steam slae for the laxt couple years and eventually if you bide your time right it will be like $5

* Trine Bundle - fun but a bit slow some times.

* Mirrors Edge - Usually around $5 and well worth the money (Read: about 6 hours of gameplay without much incentive to replay much)

**Games to Avoid**

* Magicka - this game will be $2.50 or less. This game is **SO** buggy it makes the game unplayable. I wish my expierence with it was purely anecdotal. Me and my friends all got the game, it won't even launch. We had to go into the files and pull a switacaroo and like reinstall direct x, all three of us. Then we can launch the game, since I've had problems with my saves auto deleting, or even once where it saved me a level ahead of where I was. More recentley on certain levels my whole screen just turns a shade of baby blue and I can't see where the monsters are or anything, making the game unplayable. The game has been out for nearly a year, I'm giving up hope of them fixing these problems. Also, it advertises as an RPG even though it has very little RPG elements if any at all. 

* Ubisoft Games (If you can) - I hate that I love Ubisoft. If you have a PS3 or Xbox then I would reccomend spending some extra money and just geting the console version because they are very anti-PC and their games are generally a mess to play on PCs with uPlay and DRM. I haven't playeed an Ubisoft game on my PC in a few years so it may have gotten better.

* Mafia II - Advertises as ""Open World"" but has no sidemissions, nothing to do at all except rob stores and kill cops. The missions are pretty fun but a lot of them are quite boring until like 1/2 through the game anyway. And your looking at max 12-12 hours of playtime for an open world game.

Hope this helps, my opinions are based on my experiences prior and others may have had varying experiences. Also with magicka, check if it's working, because if it is then it's worth playing for $2 if you can get a few good friends to do ti with.

So, I saw recommending Dwarf Fortress twice in a week in this subreddit and read peoples complaining about the inaccessibility of the game, so I decided to write this beginners guide to DF because I am bored.

Your first step would be to download the [Lazy Newb Pack](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=59026.0) (get the advanced one), a pack of all the essentials for starters; once downloaded and extracted, start ""Lazy New Pack.exe"", you should see [this](http://i.imgur.com/amppaUv.png).

In the ""options"" tab, I suggest you to set ""Liquid Depth"" to ""yes"" and ""Aquifers"" to ""no""  
(liquid depth replaces the water tiles graphics to numbers from 1 to 7, to indicate the depth of a flooded tile, where 1 is just a puddle and 7 is full, dwarves can walk over flooded tiles of a max of 4 depth if I recall correctly;  
aquifers are a underground level of infinite pressurized reserve of water that **will** flood your fortress if not handled properly, I play with them deactivated, so I can't help you there if you activate that).

In the ""Graphics"" tab, install either ""Ironhand"" or ""Phoebus"", and then say goodbye to the ugly ASCII graphics; [this is a screenshot of Ironhand](http://i.imgur.com/ygUBNKRh.png), and [this is the same screenshot but with Phoebus instead](http://i.imgur.com/uH1NB5Ch.png).

In the ""Utilities"" tab, for now just start SoundSense *(it will provide music and sound effect for your game, but I consider it optional)* and go to the ""soundpack update"" tab, click on ""start automatic update"" and wait for it to finish if you want, or we might just start Dwarf Fortress, since in the ""advanced"" tab of the LNP everything should be fine.

FINALLY, click on Play Dwarf Fortress.

Create a new world. To start, I advice you to make a medium world, short history, low natural savagery and everywhere minerals.

Wait for the world creation.

Start playing.

Dwarf Fortress.

Choose a site, your ideal one should be Temperate, Heavily Forested, and shouldn't be sinister, haunted or terryfying, with clay, soil, shallow metal***s*** and deep metal***s***, and a brook, stream or river, and no acquifers.

For now, just choose Lazy Newb Pack preparation pack, it contains the basic tools and trained dwarves to start.

With the remaining embark points, take with you a male and female cat (cats takes care of vermins) plus 3 turkey hen and a turkey gobbler (eggs are a good source of food, but you will need nestboxes).

Name your fortress if you like (I always name mine Dancefloor)  and embark.

Start Dwarf Therapist (is a tool to manage the different jobs of dwarves)

From now on you can experiment yourself with the game and don't be afraid to ask advice here or in /r/dwarffortress ; also, these basic notions should help you:

Dwarves **need** alcohol, water keeps them alive, but alcohol keeps them happy (keep also in mind that if there is alcohol, they won't need water).

you can make underground farms on clay or sand soils, but not on stones, you need to water stone before you can make farms over it.

Cage traps are awesome

Build your food stockpile near your meeting hall.

[Use the wiki extensively](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Main_Page), there is much to learn.

Don't be afraid of failure, you will fail anyway sooner or later.

Elves won't accept **anything** made of wood for trade.

I most likely forgot a ton of things to mention, but it's 2 A.M.here, so forgive me if the guide is somewhat incomplete, but my brain is going full idiot and there is an infinite numbers of notions for DF; so ask your questions, I'll answer with what I know, but I might answer tomorrow.

The characters, story line, dialog, and settings are right out of the sixties. You get to pick and control a few heroes as they tackle a stereotypical evil doer attacking the city. Pause the action to give them commands and let them have at it. The heroes have a variety of abilities and can make use of objects around them (pick up car and smash it into the bad guys, or just blow it up from a safe distance). It's also a role playing game so you can improve each character's skills and powers. I admit that the color is a bit over-the-top and the graphics are a bit chunky by today's standards, but that's what comics looked like (back before most of you were born). The best part of the game is the campy voice acting; very professionally done and lots of quotable catch phrases.  

The game is not supposed to be semi-realistic (like Arkham City), but much more like TV Batman, complete with ""Bam!"" and ""Pow!"" action balloons. Every character, like Minuteman, has a fully fleshed out back story and sometimes includes a sidekick (like Liberty Lad). The game is rich and fascinating and with many characters to choose from to send into battle, it has high replay value. 

The developer, by the way, is the same guy who worked on System Shock and Thief, although this game is nothing like those two classics.

To put it simply, Sleeping Dogs is GTA based in Hong Kong. It's sandbox game about the criminal world but with a couple of catches compared to the other titles.

First, it has big focus on melee hand-to-hand combat, at least in the early parts of the game. The combat consists of countering enemy moves, comboing your own and trying to control enemy groups. While this may sound boring, I found it quite enjoyable. Shooting (which I do not have too much experience on yet) is mostly cover based but still rather fast. You can enter slowmo by doing specific moves and you can reasonably take on armed enemies with melee (althought not many at a time).

Second, the environment is different from any games I've played before (save for GTA:Chinatown Wars). Environment mainly consists of city but it's not a bad thing. There are lots of different and special areas and it's not too generic. The envinronment has a heavy focus on Chinese and Asian tradition and it has lots of details, ""secet areas/passages"" and collectibles. As an interesting side note, the traffic is left-sided, which is a refreshing change.

Third, you're playing as a cop. The main character is an undercover cop infiltrating triads. You do missions for both parties, the police and the triads and you gain experience and upgrades from both parties. Triad mostly rewards you for violent and diverse combat and harming your opponents whereas the police reward you for driving carefully and avoiding unnecessary damage. This brings a nice balance to missions, as most missions have both parties reward you.

The ""craziness factor"", is somewhere between Saints Row (over the top crazy) and GTA:SA (somewhat realistic). Driving is arcadey and pretty close to PS2-era GTAs (GTA:SA, 3 and Vice City). The gameplay is on the level of the GTA and Saints Row franchise and should not let you down.

Overall, the game is a very refreshing experience, bringing sandbox crime games to a new environment and putting you in the shoes of the ""good guys"". The gameplay is solid and the game itself is pretty large and has lots of details and minigames/collectibles. I also haven't run across any technical problems (that could not be traced to my hardware acting up). For around 6€, it's a steal.

Skyrim: So much stuff to do, Combat was a bit floaty but fun, and Character creation was fun with all the races. I loved smithing.

Team Fortress 2: Something about the all the classes and weapons and hats just made me sink in near 400 hours easily with my friends.

Guild Wars 2: All the customization, difference in classes, armor, and fighting were great! Dungeons were fun with my buds.

Red Dead Redemption Multiplayer: My friends I would hop in and we even made our own 'gang' because the world was so immersive, expansive and enjoyable.

Borderlands 2: Loot, Humor, fun classes, cool customization and co-op! 

Co-op would be nice but a single player experience like Skyrim would work too. Just give me a ton of interesting things to do, and I'm hooked like a fish.

My first impression from a few hours of game-play is that it is fantastic. They took the essence of Lara croft and ported her into the world of Uncharted's modern take on adventure games. 

The voice acting is excellent and the PC port is fantastic. Right now, there is only a bug with the Tesselation settings on Nvidia cards which will be fixed ASAP. The game looks stunning with everything else set to the max. While I haven't played Crysis 3, this is definitely one of the best looking PC games I've played, if not the best. Only Witcher 2 comes close. The hair effects alone are jaw dropping. In fact, I turned off the TressFX hair to see the default style and it's amazing what a difference it makes.

Anyway, if you've been hesitating to find out if the new Tomb Raider turned into a stinker, worry not, it's safe to come aboard.

I've just beat the 2nd episode and oh my god, I don't think I've played a game like this before. Things my character had to do shocked me few times (it wasn't censored at all!), but I don't wanna spoil the ""fun"", you'll know what I mean when you get to them.


In my first sentence I said something about this being for fans of point &amp; click adventures, well some more hardcore fans can be a bit disappointed because the point&amp;clicking part is **really** easy, (however I've been stuck on some parts for about 20 minutes) this game feels more like and interactive movie, but it's not as bad as the Jurassic Park and it's QTE-based experience. Telltale Games fans can expect a great game when it comes to the story. So far I think this is my favorite (and I've played most of the TTG games, skipped this Wallace thingy, Bone, CSI, and this smartphone/tablet Hector), TWD fans will have a chance to meet SOME characters from the comics/tv series, so far I've found two, but besides watching the TV show, im not really a fan of TWD.


Also you'll have to make some hard decisions on your journey in the TWD game, and the outcome of that will haunt you through the episodes, so make sure your decision is final. So be careful what you respond, don't lie too much if you want your group to trust you, etc.


So just to be clear, for 15€ (not sure what the other prices are) you'll get to play first 2 episodes, and you'll automatically pre-order another 3 episodes, that will come out one each month. So one in August, one in September and the final one in October.

Made by Tripwire, the creators of Killing Floor and, obviously, Red Orchestra 1. It's set in Russia during World War 2 and you can play as either the Germans or the Russians. Let me preface this by saying that it has some of the best ""gamefeel"" (don't like using that word) of any shooter I've played, and the animation work is top-notch.

 The game plays similarly to Battlefield in that the maps are usually large, it's very team-oriented, and there can be up to 64 players in a server. It's more realistic, though, so you're always in danger and kills are very rewarding. Nothing feels better than finding a good position in a building and shooting Germans as they run by unaware of your location.

The population is decent enough, but it could use more players. There are always about seven or so full/highly-populated servers at a time (not sure for Europeans) and I never have trouble finding a game. 

Also, Tripwire will release a (I think, correct me if I'm wrong) standalone expansion set in the pacific theater of WWII with Americans and the Japanese, and it looks very interesting. You'll almost certainly be interested in it after playing RO:HoS.

1359754479.0,44,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,17puqt,YSB: Sleeping Dogs (75% off at GMG),le_canuck,50,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/17puqt/ysb_sleeping_dogs_75_off_at_gmg/,"I've recommended this game to several people on SIBTG the past couple of weeks and while the game's only [**$12.50 at Green Man Gaming**](http://www.greenmangaming.com/search/?q=sleeping+dogs) I've decided to take this opportunity to tell everyone that this game is absolutely worth it.

* The **story is well-crafted**, compelling, and feels like something you'd find in a Hong Kong crime film such as Infernal Affairs or something by John Woo. While some of the characters are a bit two-dimensional, the player character is just compelling enough that I found myself caring about what happened to him.

* **Playing as an undercover police officer is a nice change of pace** from games like Saint's Row and GTA, and helps the game feel like you have something on the line. There's a nice balance between trying to complete a mission as ruthlessly as you can (Killing enemies left and right, often in horrible ways) to increase your Triad score while also avoiding civillian casualties (which lower your Police score).

* The **setting is great** as well. Hong Kong feels fleshed-out and there are shiny downtown business centres, dirty slums, and seedy back alleys. In all, with the various characters running around and the diverse scenery it feels like a real place. 

* **Combat is fluid, easy to learn, and fun**. Similarly to the Arkham series, it focuses on attacks and counters, but with added grappling and the ability to use your environment to defeat your enemies. Few things feel better than successfully countering an enemy's attack, grabbing him, and throwing him through a fishtank.  

* While **gunplay could be better** (The cover system lacks refinement - sometimes I'm unable to enter cover when I feel I should be able to, and there's no way to move from cover to cover easily) it's still fun, especially diving from cover to take out enemies in slow-motion a la Max Payne.

* Unfortunately, **some aspects of the game feel forced and unfinished**. There are a few girlfriends in the game, but they all disappear with little to no explaination after one or two missions. While this isn't a big deal, the result is that these sections of the game feel detached and unnecessary. 

* The game also **lacks in end-game content**. Aside from running around to obtain all the collectables or complete sidequests (Of which there are only around 20 or 30, each taking between two and five minutes) there is little reason to keep playing the game.

All in all this game is fantastic. The main story probably takes around 20 hours or so to finish (I've done it in 24 hours, including some side-missions). Easily a steal at $12.50, it may also be worth picking up the Nightmare in North Point DLC (only $1.25) to give you a bit of extra content.

But in like the past 10 years or so, videogames have become much more focused on voice acting and dialogue, which is totally fine. His only complaint is that the games have too many ""bad words"", and he draws the line at that.

I can't introduce him to awesome games like Dead Space, Crysis, or Dishonored, because there's ""too much cussing"".

Second, I may have told you all previously, but we're going to be rolling out a new contest idea soon. If you remember back to the days of Gamer of the Week, we'll be getting something similar to that except with much better prizes, such as actual games! Definitely something to look out for during May!

And third, I would (hopefully not saying what has already been said) like to humbly welcome /u/Farts_McGee to the /r/SIBTG moderator team! He's been a great help throughout the life of this subreddit and I hope you all will help me welcome him aboard. Good to have you with us Farts! 

----

Lastly, we're going to be opening Moderator applications to the public soon. That doesn't mean that we will always be looking for Mods, but just so that we can stockpile them and pick someone when we need a new moderator. Just another thing to look out on the horizon for.

I can't reccomend this game enough. Some of the best melee combat in any game that I've seen. Amazing sound design (everything feels authentic and weapon hits sound meaty), fun objectives (killing peasants, marching a bomb to the enemy gates), pretty diverse classes, and plenty of weapon choices. The game is GORY, which is awesome beyond belief. Chopping someones leg off and them hopping on one leg till they die shortly afterwards is extremely rewarding. I bought this game for 25 bucks and put 80+ hours into it. This is my ""bang for my buck"" game of the last year. And 50% it's an absolute steal. Also, big update coming in the next month or so with new content and weapons. (copy and pasted from post in game deals) 

I'll add on a bit more. You can do ""Single player"" by starting your own server and having bots, yes they are down right retarded at times, but it's good enough to get you the basics. This game from what I've seen can run pretty decently on lower end machines. As long as you can see the enemy and objectives I wouldn't be worrying about the graphics. They're very pretty but doesn't make or break the game to have them on. The new content patch that I added? It's free and adding new weapons, new game mode ( I believe CTF), and dueling servers. Along with a new objective scenario. They will be rolling out free content updates so you won't have to drop more money on it. 

I also recommend checking out /r/ChivalryGame for guides and funny posts, as well as the steam group for the game which I am a mod for. Hope to see you guys on the battle field so I can chop your arm off for being a dirty Mason bastard! 

Edit: I'd also like to add. You're going to suck for a bit when you first start. Just learn combos, ducking, and each class till you get good at it!

I was in college, which means I had nary a dollar to my name.  My roommate and I had a long discussion about how much we missed arcades. After the conversation, I got thinking about Arkanoid and all sorts of block breaker games.  They're one of my favorite genres, largely because of the crazy powerups, the relaxing pace, and the subtle tension of trying to predict both where the ball will land and where it should go.  Now, at the time, I had just started using steam.  And I had bought portal, TF2, half life... But then that day, I chanced upon Shatter.   I thought to myself, *I've never seen anything about this or heard of this studio before.  Should I buy this game?* (Oooh, namedrop!)  I decided to give it a chance.

I'm so glad I took that risk.

Shatter is the best name anyone could have given this game.  My first impression was *wow, this is* ***polished***.  It's polished to a mirror sheen, like a prized diamond.  Its music is excellent, the electronic soundtrack's jagged waveforms once again giving the feeling of a crystal's angular form.  There's a reason the soundtrack costs as much as the game itself.  The graphics are so sharp I always feel like the pixels could draw blood.  The gameplay is exacting, as you're able to suck or blow air in order to subtly change the ball's trajectory.  Oh, and one more thing.  This game has *boss battles*.  [***Excellent*** *boss battles*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCkj51ooa_8).  

Games that feel as complete as Shatter does are few and far between.  It's a shining crystal of game design, everything pointing towards one theme.  I don't know if Shatter is on sale right now, or if it will be any time soon.  But regardless of price, I suggest you get this game.  

Every game I buy blindly or on a single enthusiastic recommendation, I hope it ends up being as good a purchase as Shatter was.

I was lucky enough to be able to grab Assassin's Creed 3 a few days before release, and just completed it not but a few minutes ago.  I wanted my initial reactions to be as fresh as possible.

I will **NOT** discuss the plot of the game as I don't want to dare risk spoiling anything. Also, I have not yet touched the Multiplayer.  I always beat campaigns first.

Thus, *WYSB Assassin's Creed 3*.

**PROS:**


**Life** - There has never been so much to do in an Assassin's Creed title, nor has the world ever felt quite so alive.  The cities are packed with small tasks to complete and dozens of items to collect.  They come across as more alive than just about any other gaming locations I've ever been in short of perhaps the Mass Effect series.  Hundreds of city dwellers walking about their business, dozens of enemies to take care of at a time, and a massive world.  **Anyone who likes exploring every nook and cranny of a game world is going to have a ball here.**  The Frontier area especially piques my interest, as one's time spent there may lead them to draw more than one comparison to Red Dead Redemption.  Hunting, gathering, finding items, building your Homestead and helping its citizens, crafting new weapons and items to trade for income, joining a fighting ring, hunting for treasure, even sailing the seas - and this is all ignoring the main story.


**The Combat** - Facing down a dozen musket-armed soldiers armed with but some blades and a single pistol may seem impossible at first, but in the right hands the flow of combat becomes something amazing.  **Those of you looking for an entirely stealth-heavy game may be disappointed, as facing your enemy head on has never been more feasible.**  Sneaking around and silently taking care of your enemies is common and rewarding, but when you find yourself in a serious fight, you'll really be able to hold your own.  Connor is a ruthless fighter, and you've never been so well armed.  The first time you counter two soldiers at the same time, you'll fall in love with the combat system.  

Oh, and don't get me started on the sailing combat.  Let me put it this way: **If the sailing portion of this game were expanded on, i.e. multiple ship types to choose from with multiplayer, it'd be a day one buy for me.**


**The Setting** - Now this is slightly biased as I am A: An American and B: This game takes place in the general area that I grew up in, but this is a truly unique setting for this story to unfold.  **In previous installments of the series, your story took place in a well developed society, one where there was peace.  No longer.**  The new world is just being built, and with it your quest.  It is much more difficult to earn large amounts of coin, and the time needed to let your home grow to assist in this endeavor is sizable.  The way Connor's tale is interwoven with the American Revolution is intriguing, as are his personal goals.  He's very unlike the other assassins we've played as, but he should be - the world is very unlike any the world had yet seen.


**CONS:**


**The Pacing** - Last time I answered a question about AC3, I said that I thought it would be fine for players who just wanted to get in there and start assassinating.  **I'm not so sure I would follow my old advice after playing through the game, as it takes quite a while for things to really get started.**  Connor is essentially forced through all of the training Ezio had three entire games to go through, and you'll be quite sick of tutorials.  This means you need to learn how to move, fight, defend, sneak, and train assassins all over again, in addition to the new training associated with hunting, tracking and sailing.  Theres a lot to wade through, and its worth getting through, but it may deter some newcomers.


**The Small Flaws** - This game is not perfect, not even close.  It's actually buggy.  **There aren't any gamebreaking bugs, but sometimes things will just disappear.  Also, sometimes you just won't be able to climb something anymore with no good reason why.**  These small errors come up so irregularly that it will only end up causing temporary frustration, but there is no ignoring that they are there.  I've had characters load with no movement information, so they all float along with their arms held out like they are pretending to be an airplane.  One time early on in the game, a character's facial animations did not load for a cutscene, so he shouted and raved with no moving lips, face stiff as a board.  There is also quite a bit of pop-in to the graphics as you run along at top speed.  Grass can just spout out of the ground suddenly or an entire search party of British soldiers can appear quite closer than you'd like.  Again, these are all relatively small grievances in a truly gigantic game world, but they are worth noting.


**Personal Notes**

In many, many ways this game is a complete triumph.  It is the culmination of the entire series, a fantastic imagining of this mythos brought to the colonial shores of America.  Connor, or rather Ratonhnhaké:ton, earns his place in the pantheon of this series, and is a truly unique character within the mythos that I really hope we get to visit again.  To try to cram as much story Ezio was given into the time Ratonhnhaké:ton has in this title was an impossible task, and thanks to that the game does falter at times, but get through the worst of it and the game really shines.  The game looks fantastic and plays very well.  No matter where you are in the game world, you will be able to find something to do or someone to help.  Moving through the forests that look so similar to those close to where I grew up brought a smile to my face, but I can't help but fear some may find the forests a bit bland compared to the marble Renaissance of Ezio.

I feel the game should not be held up as the best in the series.  Quite a bit is thrown at the player very quickly, and entire portions of the game can be easily missed by a player who just wants to see the story through.  **The game is designed to make you feel more alone than you ever have in this series, and in that they are very successful, but it's up to the individual player if that is a good thing or a bad thing.**  If you simply stick to the main story, you can expect the game to take about 15-20 hours.  If you are a completionist, you might be able to push it to 30.  I finished with 81% Synch with a final playtime of 25 hours.  

What other opinions I have of the game I won't speak of here, as they are mainly plot related. **Simply put, Assassin's Creed 3 is not the best entry in the series.  I will say that it is at the very least tied for a very solid 2nd Place though.**  Fans of the series will surely get the most out of it, but those new to the series should be wary that there is quite a bit to wade through before you get to the juicy stuff.  It's worth it though.

1342497022.0,37,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,wom8p,YSB: Civilization V (From someone with 200 hours into the game),IIHURRlCANEII,45,8,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/wom8p/ysb_civilization_v_from_someone_with_200_hours/,"First, if you are reading this, Civ V is on the flash deal for 3 more hours or so, so what are you [waiting for](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/15366?snr=1_4_4__sfs)?

Civ V, where do I begin...one if you are reading this Civ V is a game where you play as God over a civilization from the history books, such as Ancient Japan, Byzantine Empire, etc.  You build up your Civ through the ages starting from 4000 BC, until you reach one of the 5 victory conditions.

The game is amazing, fun, and makes you think a little.  It is incredibly easy to pick up, fun to play over and over, and has the biggest replay value I've ever found in a game since I picked up Fallout: New Vegas (A year and a half before I got Civ V).  Every experience is a new one for each time you generate a game with the Civ of your choice, you have dozens of different map types to choose from.

I'm sure you've all heard this, so I'm going to go into why you should pick up V instead of IV or even the Total War series (Which I also adore and praise).

**AS FOR CIV IV:** 

I've always seen the veteran Civ players say IV was better, more deeper, etc.  And to this?  I agree, somewhat.  Civ IV had the better tech, and somewhat better handlings of how your civ worked.  But the thing Civ V beats it wholeheartedly in is the mechanics of playing.  In V they switched to the hex-grid which is 10x better than the square grids of IV, in V they switched to only one unit occupying said grids, in stead of the armies of death that plauged IV.  

Also, IV is older, and more outdated in terms of looks, so if that is dealbreaker, obviously get V.

Also, V is easier to pick up.  I was understanding every aspect of the game within my first playthrough, which is pretty interesting seeing as it took me three playthroughs of Empire: Total War before I completely grasped all the concepts (granted, that is probably a more deep game).

Anyways, to sum up Civ IV vs Civ V:

IV:

1. Better Tech Tree

2. Better overall tools to control the empire

V: 

1. Better fluidity

2. Better Unit Management

3. Better display (Hex Grids)

My opinion?  New to the franchise?  Buy Civ V GOTY, and if you really love it, go back and get IV, it's not that bad.

**AS FOR VS OTHER COMPETING GAMES:**

While I love the Total War games, and I like how they made the game much easier to access in Shogun 2 (at least for me), Civ V is such an easy game to pick up, and to play endlessly.  Empire games focus always one one thing, battles and domination.  Civ V you have 5 different ways to win, and many ways to get to that win.  There is Science, Culture, Time, Domination, and Diplomatic.  All of them fun in their respective rights.  

Civ V really is a great game, and if I had to pick, as much as I love the Total War games, I would pick the Civ games over them, just for the simple fact that they are more deep, and easier to access and pick up right away.


Now, just a few things IF you are getting Civ V and are reading this:

1. Do you have extra money lying around, I FULLY SUGGEST YOU GETTING GODS AND KINGS RIGHT EFFING NOW!  [HERE IS THE LINK!](http://store.steampowered.com/app/16870/)  G&amp;K make the game SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO much better, that I just can't express in words how much.  Faith, spies, the new civ's, the AI fixes, the better Naval combat, and more.  God, it makes it a brand new game.  I HIGHLY SUGGEST IT!

2. If you do pick up Civ V, good on you!  You should head directly to the Steam Workshop and see if there are any mods that interest you, for Civ V also supports the Steam Workshop.  

3. /r/civ is one of the best subreddits for a game I have ever seen, and they have good discussion on top of funny posts.

Wow, I can't believe I wrote that about one game...haha.  If you did read this and enjoyed it please upvote it, for I've seen a LOT of posts about if someone should get Civ V.

P.S.  PLEASE also get Total War games and Civ IV, they are amazing as well.

I’ve seen lots of great recommendations for games that I love on this sub, and I want to contribute. I’m going to make a wee series of YSBs, so if you like this one, check out my others. I plan on doing Braid and Limbo at least, maybe others, and would have done FTL and Bastion if they hadn’t been done so well in the past already. I love all games, but indie PC games especially, so that’s what I’ll be concentrating on. If you have a request for a game, let me know and I’ll play it, and we can see how much I like it.

Anyhow, on to Superbrothers: Swords &amp; Sworcery. This was a largely overlooked game on release due to it being such an odd “game” if you can even call it that. It received nearly all positive reviews, including a very well written (as always) one in the “Wot I Think…” series from Rock Paper Shotgun. 

The game itself is hard to put in a genre. It takes some strong and obvious leads from older Zelda games, but turns it into a retro point-and-click. At the same time, its hard to call it retro for anything other than its visuals, and hard to call it a point-and-click due to the fact that it shares almost nothing with any other game in that genre. It’s a unique experience, and an amazing one at that.

**Story**
Zzzzzzz…… OH sorry, theres a story? Oh, right, it’s something about a magic book or something. And an evil spirit is involved somehow. Our hero and his dog are there to stop it. This story doesn’t suck or anything, it’s just cliché. But it’s SUPPOSED to be cliché. Keep reading, and you’ll see why you shouldn’t pay a lick of attention to the story in this game.

**Gameplay**
It’s basic. VERY basic. There are puzzles, but not the kind you have to actually think about. There’s action, but you’ll likely only fail once or twice. Like the story, it’s made to be basic for a reason. We’re getting closer…

**Graphics**
Now you’re not going to believe this, but… it’s pretty basic. Looks 8 bit, acts 16 bit. Its unique, that’s for sure. And it’s surprisingly pretty; very serene. 

So why should you play this game that sounds so basic to the point of being boring? Well…

**Soundtrack**
There is a reason they call this game an EP: music is pretty much the whole purpose of the game. The soundtrack is my Jim Guthrie, and he also plays a cameo in the game. EVERYTHING is music centric. Puzzles, battles, traveling, all of it has to do with the tempo, octave, etc. of the music. And it’s amazing. The soundtrack is so good that I listen to it on my way to work every morning. But is it enough to base a whole game just around its soundtrack?

Well, here’s the thing: when you first start a new game, there is a narrator. This narrator tells you that you shouldn’t play to win; you should play for the experience. I didn’t believe him at first. After all, he also told me that I should tweet about my experience as it happens. Well, I didn’t do the tweets, but damn was he right about playing for the experience. It’s like being on a drug. The game will enchant you into enjoying it like nothing you’ve ever experienced. It will put you in a mood where you don’t even care if you win or lose, you’re just happy to be there. Literally everything in the game seems to be made to get you into that trance. The game is even broken up into chapters, with the narrator stopping to remind you of what’s happened in the plot, and what you’re doing now; because frankly, you’ll be too engrossed in the sights and sounds to care about anything else. 

So if you’re open minded about gaming and are looking for a new experience, get this game. It has been in TWO humble bundles now, and is available on steam or straight from the developer for next to nothing. You can get it for PC, Linux, Mac, or even Android, though I’d only play it if you’re on a tablet. **USE HEADPHONES** especially if you’re on an Android device. Good ones if you have them. And play it on one of those Saturday afternoons that you’ve got nothing to do. If you take the game for what it is, it can be one of the best experiences you’ll ever have.

Oh, and by the way, if you’re interested in the Android version, it’s a FLAWLESS port.

I'm guessing it's because this game flew largely under the radar. But anyways, why should you buy it? Here are a few reasons.

Reason 1: **This game is GORGEOUS!**

I know, I know. Graphics don't really make the game, but this one really does it for me. For a seemless, fully open world game, the graphics are stunning. If you're buying for PC, be sure you have a suitably beefy GPU to handle it if you plan on playing it maxed out. Character models are rather detailed (although enemy model variety becomes obviously samey if you play for long enough. You'll be able to identify ""drug suppliers"" for your surveillance missions within seconds of checking security feeds after maybe 3 or 4 goes at them), but the really cool thing about this game is, believe it or not, blood and sweat (and water, if it's raining.) The way the game renders blood and other liquids on your clothing is nothing short of totally awesome. Walk out in the rain for a bit? You bet you're going to ruin that designer suit. Get into a brawl with some thugs and meat the business end of a knife before turning it on its owner? Those stains won't come out until you change your clothes or spend a night at home. Stopping by the kung fu dojo to learn some new moves? Better admire the sheen of sweat on Wei's face once he steps out the door after a training session. The attention to detail in this regard is spot on.

Oh...and the vehicles are stunning. We're talking racing game quality looks (not Forza, mind you, but a little more Need For Speed.)

Reason 2 **An interesting story with characters you care about.**

If you've played Saint's Row III (another of my favorite open world games), you'll find that you aren't really endeared to any of the characters all that much. You take your jobs and maybe do some escorting, or drive a car and then you GOD DAMMIT, PEIRCE, STOP GETTING STUCK IN CROWDS OF ENEMIES!

Ahem. Sorry. In Sleeping Dogs, you'll legitimately care about most of the people you interact with. From scrawny gangster patsy Jackie, to hot-headed, burly Winston, to the strangely intimidating elderly gang chairman Uncle Po, you'll find something to like about all these characters. Oh, and those ""escort"" missions I mentioned? Yeah. If you're going to get into a fight, your buddies don't require babysitting since they can kick just as much ass as you. A refreshing reprieve from looking over your shoulder to make sure Cousin Roland doesn't get shot in the face.

Moreover, they aren't just flat cardboard cutouts like most of the characters you'd find in, say, the GTA series. There's complexity to the characters. For example, in the early phases of the game, you engineer the comeuppance of a gangster who has been a thorn in your side from the start, and the way he reacts to realizing he's been beaten is pathetic. Also thanks in part to excellent voice-acting and (again) the graphical detail of his facial expression, I actually felt sorry for this guy who, up to that point, had just been some asshole who hounded me, as he was greeting what I had set out for him.

Combine this with excellent writing, top-notch voice acting, and a story full of twists and turns that, really, doesn't show its hand all that often, and you've got a legendary crime drama on your hands.

My only real gripe with the story is the ""girlfriend"" side-stories that start up, then go nowhere. You do a mission to meet the girl you want to woo, do one subsequent mission from which you get a little exploration bonus, and then (with the exception of two girls) they are never mentioned again.

Reason 3: **Dat Combat.**

I played a bit of Arkham Asylum, but still haven't been able to find time to invest in it all that heavily. That said, I knew how satisfying the combat was, and this game does a great job of emulating the same sort of hard-hitting, stylish hand-to-hand combat that AA first brought to the forefront.

It's not all the same, of course. Wei swaps out Batman's gadgets for more complex martial arts, as well as dirty street-fighting techniques like tackling an enemy and taking a pot shot at their face.

Moreover, the gunplay, while not perfect, is surprisingly well implemented. You can only carry one gun at a time (you don't have holsters, so you can't exactly tuck an arsenal into your pants), so choosing your weapon is important. People NOTICE firearms when you pull them out, so walking around with your pistol out in this game is far different than it would be in GTA or SR. You're actually encouraged to only use your gun as a last resort when bullets start to fly, and thanks to a myriad of ways to disarm your opponents, it's easy to get on the winning side of a fight if you pick your targets.

The aiming takes a little getting used to. Guns don't have pinpoint accuracy in this game, so you won't be cranking out headshots from 30 yards away with a pistol, so you're encouraged to advance on your foes and use the game's jump-over-cover-into-bullet-time mechanic.

My only issue with the combat is that some of the moves from the kung fu dojo can completely trivialize fights, and when taking cover during a firefight, Wei doesn't stick to and unstuck from cover as well as I'd like him to. I've died a number of times because I hit the take-cover button and Wei stuck to the wrong side of a box and ate bullets (which do a pretty hefty amount of damage, as bullets should, even with your health fully upgraded.)

Reason 4: **Activities, activities, activities!**

Seriously...there's so much shit to do in Hong Kong. Drug bust missions, surveillance camera hacking, lockbox opening, chop shop missions, debt collection, collecting statues and health shrines, busting up parking meters for quick cash, street racing, free-running, insurance fraud, cheating-girlfriend-stalking, etc. and so forth.

Seriously, I've never once ended a Sleeping Dogs play sessions because I couldn't find something to do. There have been times when I've started up the game to advance the story, and find myself two hours into playing without having done ANY story missions because I got caught up doing drug busts or helping out people who just ran into me on the streets or trying to find a way to reach that one health shrine that popped up on my map 5 minutes ago.

Trust me, if you get Sleeping Dogs, it'll keep you occupied for a long, long time.


So yeah, that's my way too long review for Sleeping Dogs. It's currently available on Steam for 40 dollars (well worth that price, too), but if you're feeling cheap, it commonly drops to 20 whenever a sale rolls by. Be sure to have some ample hard drive space set aside for it, as it is a BEEFY fucker of a game. It's also available on PS3 and the Xbox 360, and can most likely be found for 40 bucks at any brick and mortar retailer, or even cheaper used.

Why You Should Buy This Package

A) It's pay what you want. No need to spend big bucks on this package.

B) You get all versions. This is especially awesome if you have an Android phone/tablet - that way you can have these games with you on the go.

C) If you like Audiosurf and Geometry Wars, Beat Hazard is awesome. I've actually been playing this game on my phone *while sitting behind my desktop*. That has never happened before, it's just that awesome.

D) If you already have one of these games, don't redeem the code you've been given. You can give that code to someone else, as all of these codes are independent of each other.
___

I haven't really played the other games yet. I played Solar 2 on my phone, and thought it was a bit too slow paced for a mobile app. After about 10 minutes I had enough, and I was only at the third stage. Luckily you can save your progress to designated slots, so you can have different games instead of just one. Super Hexagon is insanely hard, but it's a fun timesink while sitting on the toilet. I haven't played Dungeon Defenders on my phone yet, but it was a fun game on the PC. I expect a fairly more limited edition as compared to the PC-edition.

Welp, this is the best I can do. I think it is worth it for Beat Hazard alone. It has last.fm integration on desktop, so it'll keep score of which songs you played, which is neat. Haven't found this feature on my phone yet.

I first read about the game in a game magazine maybe around 2008, I don't remember which one. I remember nothing about what was talked about except post-apocalyptic Russia, people living in the subways, and vague unspecific monstrous threats to be handled.

And then I never thought about it again.

Until this summer, when during the sale it was available for $5 on Greenman Gaming. Having $5 given to me free by having bought a different game there, I got Metro 2033 for free and proceeded to be unable to get it, as they had run out of steam keys. I think I should have taken this as a good omen, but I didn't think about it. Incidentally I also didn't think about the game, as I was about to purchase it on Steam when I talked myself into recalling my getting it on GMG.

The first thing I noticed was that there wasn't an option for windowed. Being a prolific multitasker I very much dislike when games do this, as it typically ends up with me playing much less as I can't tab in and out as I'm forced to solely pay attention to the game, and should the game be uninteresting it creates a loop wherein I dislike playing the game more and more. Fortunately for the game, but more importantly me for not putting it down, Metro 2033 held me from the go.

You play as the character Artyom, you were born in the subways after the bombs fell and were trained by an elite hunter. But for the rest of the story I defer you to playing the game.

Metro 2033 is not about a superb fighting experience. Your guns will be effective, and as in every game ever it's extremely satisfying to blow an enemy away with both rounds of a dual-barrel shotgun. You will be stealthy at times, but you don't need to be, it is a mechanic that is meant to be appreciated but is not overbearing about it. The inventory system is spartan, holding precisely what you need and nothing more. No, Metro 2033 is about the story, about the world of man as it struggles to survive against never-before-encountered threats. It is a game of atmosphere, with monsters of the sky, and of the earth. Devil bats and Nosalis. But you're not persisting against monsters alone but the conflicting edges of man as well. At points of the game you will have to maneuver through the battlefields, well, battle*tunnels*, of a war being fought between Neo-Marxists and Neo-Fascists.

You should not come from the game thinking of any innovation in mechanics, but hopefully one of story. Metro 2033 can be compared with Bioshock for atmosphere, but in that regard the former exceeds the latter.

It's $5.

You won't spend a better $5 on a game than this. 

Seriously.

I like business running/resource gathering games, so at face value it sounds appealing. I'm concerned about a lack of depth or breadth, poor/clunky controls and/or a bad UI, or that it's just not that great.

Any input will be appreciated, thank you.

**Edit**: Thanks to /u/WhoNeedsNicknames, I downloaded and played the demo.

It's alright. The game seems like it has a lot of detail in the farm equipment when you really get into it, but I don't really like it. I think my #1 issue is that it doesn't feel enough like a *game*. I was anticipating/hoping for a resource-gathering game set in the boundaries of a farming environment, with typical elements such as clear-cut objectives with good directions, like waypoints or highlighted vehicles/locations. It leaves it mostly to you to figure out how to play, and in that it does a good job, but at the same time that diminishes the game environment while strongly emphasizing that it's really just simulating the use of various farm equipment. I really like the tab between vehicles mechanic, but then again if that mechanic weren't there the game would be very tedious having to walk all around the (admittedly huge) map. 

I didn't feel like I accomplished anything while playing it. Harvested a field, loaded the harvest into a silo, but that core mechanic didn't do much for me so I feel like I wouldn't enjoy the rest of the game, either. But again, that's just my experience.

However, the key questions I have about it are:

* **How well does it portray a World War II battle environment in terms of atmosphere, strategy, and simulation?**

* **How does the game fare on a scale of realism and World War II?**

* **How steep is the learning curve compared to other similar games (ie Call of Duty, Hearts of Iron, etc.)**

* **Is the game mod-able and are there any good mods that add either more historic objects/atmosphere or realism to the game?**

* **Excluding the World War II side of it, how fun of a game is it in and of itself?**

* **Should I purchase Company of Heroes or wait for Company of Heroes 2 or expect to purchase both?**

Minecraft (I'd play Minecraft forever if it was a lot more survival-y)

WoW/GW2

The Witcher (all)

You can probably track it down for about the same price on /r/steamgameswap or /r/gamesell if you want, but it goes on sale pretty often enough

It is single-handedly one of the most emotionally traumatic experiences I've had playing a game. Am I exaggerating? I'm a little shell-shocked to be honest. 

I'm not big on shooter games, I only get one if a lot of my friends play the mutliplayer but the only other game I finished was Bulletstorm. 

I don't want to give much away, but if you like interactive storytelling and moral choices in a game, or you're a fan of Apocolypse Now / Heart of Darkness, *stop* reading and the get the game right now. And play it on easy. 

The game at first seems like a straight-forward modern military shooter game. You are in command of a small squad sent in to save an old war buddy from Dubai. Slowly the game devolves into something troubling: making you feel actual guilt for shooting people in the video game, people you wouldn't blink an eye while killing in most shooter games. There's no tongue-in-cheek attitude or fun with this. It's gritty and throughout the game you wonder why you are still in this clusterfuck. 

The game itself plays pretty well, the game mechanics aren't perfect but it's not about the gameplay, it's about the story and how the characters change throughout the story arc. I'm **big** on story in video games, and this one has one of the best narratives I've experienced. 

**You should buy Spec Ops: The Line** *if* you appreciate a character arc, well-done integrated narrative, and themes of dystopia and the human psyche in the context of a shooter game. 

**BUT** you should *not* buy Spec Ops: The Line if you usually skip cutscenes. you should skip out on this game if you don't like gameplay to be the following: 

1.  walk towards next checkpoint 
2.  short cutscene where shit hits the fan 
3. shooting gallery
4. Repeat walk to next checkpoint. 

The game itself right there does not require strategy, thinking, or much of anything besides aiming. If you don't care for story in video games, this game will be absolutely nothing special. Just a somewhat flawed shooter game in future post-disaster Dubai. 

You should also not buy this game if you have a weak heart. If you don't like violence in video games, this will not sit well in your stomach. You also might just put down the controller half-way. And that's *an ending* of the game according to the game developers.

**You should NOT buy Spec Ops: The Line** if you want new innovative or perfect gameplay, if you don't care for cutscenes, or if you have a weak heart.

... If you like resource gathering.

... If you like games where needs (water, sleep, time, etc) management is a huge part of the experience.

... If you are into survival horror/mystery.


When I first saw Miasmata on Steam Greenlight, I was intrigued by the concept. A plague stricken scientist stuck on an island, looking for his lost companions and a cure to the plague that affects him. I voted for it and carried on - and was pleased to find that it was Greenlit and released.

When I first started, the atmosphere immediately drew me in. You have nothing except a notepad to start with and an uncharted island to explore - and to keep yourself alive, you *need* to explore. You're thrown in with little direction, given only hints by way of notes left by colleagues along with their crudely drawn maps abandoned at campsites throughout the island.  You are able to start to figure out your position, using these maps and the unique cartography system to triangulate your position. Eventually you get thirsty - but you can't drink sea water, so you have to find fresh water around the island. You also need to light a fire or sleep in a bed in order to save, so if you die midway you're screwed.

Movement is realistic. You're not going to jog up a cliff with the plague. You move slowly up. When you're on an incline, you go faster. When you fall down, you stumble and everything in your hands goes flying. When you swim, you get worn out and can drown. If you're walking down a hill and feel yourself slipping, you can right yourself by fiddling with the directional keys.

The plague is another hindrance.  If you try to carefully walk down a hill, you may fall - and after you're done tumbling, you'll find your vision is blurry and you can't walk straight. Only by gathering the native flora and examining it in the abandoned research sites can you bring your fever down. If your fever gets high, you stumble, your vision blurs and blackens. I once had a high fever at night and ended up stumbling off a hill and dying.

It's as frustrating as it is enjoyable. Charting the island and suddenly... there's the creature! And it wants to eat your face! But no, I just found a component to the plague cure! Crap I'd better run, throwing rocks at it just made it mad - OH GOD A CLIFF NO WHY *stumblestumblestumble* 

... where'd the flower go? Crap I must have dropped it! But the creature is around here somewhere! And it's already 8 PM and I'm not near a torch or a bed!

There are cons, of course. The graphics are not Skyrim quality and sometimes flicker, and sometimes if you aren't careful your characters arm will disconnect from his body for a moment. But aside from a few bugs here and there, it's truly an experience worth the price, in my eyes.

Here's some screenshots I grabbed.

I've had my eye on To The Moon for awhile now and grabbed the bundle right away when I saw it was included.  I knew it was story-based and figured 10$ might be a little much to pay for 4 hours of gameplay but the game is easily worth the price of the whole bundle (currently around $5 USD) and it's exceptionally well done. I haven't even played any of the other games yet but I'm already satisfied with my bundle purchase. In fact, after playing To The Moon I think the 10$ base price is worth it, so even if you miss the bundle grab the game anyway. Please comment on the other games if you know anything about them.

*On To The Moon*

A wonderful example of games as art and interactive storytelling, To The Moon is a deep experience inovling the exploration of heavy themes such as death and happiness. The soundtrack is phenomenal and the 8-bit graphics are quite charming and fit the game exceedingly well. The gameplay is simple, involving collecting reference ""items"" and puzzle unscrambling, so if you're only into games as ""games"" then you can probably miss this game without looking back; however, if you enjoy games for the stories they tell and the emotions they can make you feel, do NOT miss this important forray into narrative gaming.

*Pros:*

Phenomenal Soundtrack

Emotionally Engaging

Highly Polished


*Cons:*

No Settings (Can't Change Resolution)

1370317050.0,30,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,1fmoer,YSNB Fuse,Kovukono,35,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1fmoer/ysnb_fuse/,"[Fuse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JyokG3aHVo) seems like a great game, at its premise. Insomniac Games, the creators of well-known crazy-weapon game series such as Ratchet and Clank and Resistance, make a game where they give you four new guns and encourage you to work together with these guns to make combos and take down scores of enemies. You might remember it as the gritty, realistic reboot of the game that originally premiered as [Overstrike](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ythBZY_y-fU). The game itself is fun and decently rewarding to play--but only while it lasts.

Insomniac's other games have been excellent about the amount of content given. Ratchet and Clank games often go upwards of twelve hours and offer New Game+. Resistance offered campaigns with a good length all the way through the series. Fuse's campaign would put the games such as the later Call of Duties and Battlefield 3 to shame, clocking in at roughly three hours across six separate levels, four hours if you're generous. However, the campaign is entirely multiplayer capable (I recommend playing multiplayer) and also comes with split-screen support, which is a plus.

In addition to this, there are also six horde-mode levels (dubbed ""Echelon"") that are lifted almost in their entirety from the single-player game that consist of twelve separate waves. During these waves you're expected to perform the tasks of killing all enemies, unlocking a weapons box while under enemy fire, guarding a fuse (the guns' ammo) container, transporting a fuse container from one area to another, and killing a mech (with a bonus if done within a time limit). These take 15-30 minutes to complete and do require a competent team to see them through to the end.

After you've completed both of these modes in about eight hours, there's very little reason to play on.

The main replayability that the game has are characters' levels and perks. Each character can go up to level 35 and levels independently of the others in combat. However, it appears that out of combat events, such as completing objectives or picking up XP containers, apply to all characters, making the drive to get to the max level even shorter. Each character has a new skill in their tree that they can learn upon gaining a level. The skill trees are almost exactly the same, with just a few changes for each team member's weapon.

Perks, on the other hand, rely on currency found in the game called ""fuse credits"" which come in bundles of 500 in the campaign and at roughly 10,000 per complete match in Echelon mode with increases in credits in later levels. Each perk gives a bonus to the team, such as an increase in XP or fuse credits, a boost in sidearm power, or increased bleedout time when characters are downed. Perks have three levels, costing 10k, 20k, and 30k respectively. There are a few exceptions, however--one level three costs 100k. Overall, I estimate that somewhere near 1,000,000 fuse credits are needed for level 3 of all 16 perks. Again, this comes out to 100 matches, or about 25 hours of grinding (at minimum). You'll receive the XP needed to reach max level for all characters in a fraction of the time.

The plot throughout these six levels is incredibly succinct, and involves your team chasing a generic private military company with the even more generic name of ""Raven"" in order to track down a giant canister of ""corrupted"" fuse. The game tries and fails to get you attached to the main characters, featuring an agent whose father is part of the nondescript bad guys, the two male leads who are the source of forced humor, and the hacker who almost never speaks. Each agent is also shown to have a dark moment of their past which is completely at odds with the rest of the game and absolutely unnecessary--yet this gritty backstory is almost all we get for any of the characters. The aforementioned bad humor consists primarily of jokes about Dalton's fear of cats and his ex-girlfriend who appears as a boss and is rarely funny. Overall, the campaign feels soulless and often stops the hectic action, the game's one selling point, for exposition on the bland and cliched story.

I'm not saying that the game doesn't have its high points. Watching groups of enemies get sucked in by wormholes, crystallizing and shattering bad guys, pinning them to the wall with crossbow bolts, sneaking around them and blowing them away with a shotgun while invisible--there's a good amount that Fuse has to offer. It can be a very, very fun game. The only problem is that with the lack of content and the terrible story it has to offer, the honeymoon ends fast. There's little fun to be had in the repetitiveness once you've maxed out levels, and the grinding for fuse credits is intolerable. It's absolutely not worth the $60 asking price. Renting it for a weekend, on the other hand, can make quite a fun time.",[PS3][Xbox],False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,gold,True,t3_1fmoer,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1fmoer/ysnb_fuse/,
1367311888.0,34,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,1defnb,YSB: Receiver on Steam,Obesely,38,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1defnb/ysb_receiver_on_steam/,"I've never felt compelled to march on this subreddit and make a YSB post, however, it's finally time. 

'Receiver' is the fruit of 7 days of labour for the 7-day FPS challenge by Wolfire Games that explores a side of gun mechanics rarely tackled by modern titles (indie or otherwise). We're all familiar with the occasional game that will make you lose bullets if you reload, but what if there was a game that took everything one step further? Before I get onto that, here's a general overview: 'Receiver' is a game that has you exploring a building, with the object of finding audio cassettes strewn throughout it. The building is comprised of a randomly generated sequence of (premade) areas. Also randomised is your starting equipment (flashlight, number of bullets, number of magazines [for guns that use magazines]), as well as the location of cassettes and ammunition, and the placement of enemies (flying taser drones, and automated turrets). You'll have to bear with me, as I have never written one of these, but let's get right to the heart of what makes this game amazing: the best goddamn gun mechanics I've ever seen in a videogame.

You can (and have to) learn to manipulate every part of the gun you're given in order to make it work. That is to say, everything from the safety to the slide to the hammer. If one wants to reload a weapon with a magazine, it must be ejected, and either dropped (to speed up the process) or placed back in your inventory and you must then take a fresh magazine from your inventory. Then you must place the magazine back into the weapon and pull back the slide (and if you want to be pedantic, you can even press a certain combination of buttons to inspect the chamber of the gun). A revolver will have you placing in bullets one by one, and will require you to remove the casings of used bullets in order to reload it. If you want to actually load a magazine, you have to holster your weapon (so that you have use of both your hands).

This is just one of the most organic experiences I've ever had in a videogame and it was made in only 7 damn days. It blows my mind. I can't wait to see what lies in store for these ideas! If you want to run, you have to keep tapping W, and your running speed depends on the frequency of your taps. I haven't played very much so I can't comment much further, but, suffice to say, you should all buy it. It is on special right now (I payed less than $5 AUD for it).

Oh, and one thing I forgot to mention: there is permadeath, and all it takes is one bullet or so to kill you. When you die, you re-roll in a different building, with a different starting equipment (my favourite example: one time when I spawned with a glock with a single magazine and only one bullet).

**EDIT: Thank you, *Johnny_Gossamer*: ""Please buy directly from the developer through Humble! You'll get a DRM-free version of the game AND a Steam key for the same price if you just bought the game through Steam. This way it goes directly to the game devs.""**

* Uncharted Trilogy
* Journey Collector's Edition (possibly; also what are your thoughts on this(these) game(s)?)

And lastly, if it matters, I am a freshman in college so I don't know how much free time I'll have to play games. Also, by the time the PS4 comes out, I'll be a sophomore and may be busier than ever.

These are two different games. But XCOM is on every current system imaginable EXCEPT the 3DS or nintendo systems of old, and Fire Emblem: Awakening is on the 3DS (and previous games were on every nintendo system back to the GameBoy)

**My plan is to convince you to buy one of these awesome and oddly similar games, and you have no reason to say ""oh it's not on my system""**
___ 
**BOTH GAMES:**

* Strategic top-town turn-based game where you move your soldiers across a battlefield rife with enemies. You take your band of warriors to fight alien/evil forces, and re-establish peace in the world. You move your people across a grid, watching the danger zones

* When one of your soldiers die, it's GAME OVER for them. Permanently. No take-backsies. You have to load up an older save file to bring back your fallen comrade. Permadeath is an important and riveting feature in both games, as you take extra precaution with characters you might not care for if they were more dispensable. 

* In missions, you may just have to kill all the bad guys, but some missions include the optional objective to rescue hostages or common allies. 

* the gameplay is very very engrossing and has a really nice learning curve so even casual gamers can get caught up and addicted to the intense gameplay while setting their own pace. You could take as long as you wanted to chose your plan of attack

* The battles and fights happen as a sort-of cutscene. You choose the weapon and angle of attack, keeping in mind the accuracy and hp or your weapon and character and the stats of the opponent. The combat is nail-biting when your character could die or miss a critical attack.


Those are the best ways to describe both games. And they are oddly similar despite being two completely different settings and plots. So I'll explain what makes each game different. 

______

**XCOM: Enemy Unknown:**

* Future Earth has created a task force of elite soldiers to eliminate an invading alien threat. Sci-fi with laser rifles, alien technology, and big shiny armor.

* Your units seem extremely dispensable at first. Sure you can customize and name them (as most do), but they seem to blend in with each other really well interchangably. But as you level them up and gain nicknames for them as well as special skills, you really grow attached. I had actually named my characters Douchebag names at first to avoid becoming emotionally attached. But I cannot explain in words the pain I felt when Sgt. Mustache Rides died in combat. Extremely sad day that was.

* Your weapons are rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, plasma rifles, etc. Standard military sci-fi fare.

* There is micro-management and strategy in your HQ as well, with allocating a budget, creating new facilities, and upgrading your units or artillery. 

* **AVAILABLE FOR: Windows, Mac, X360, PS3, iPad, iPhone** *I have it on PC, but it works just as well on any system, and I've heard really good things about the iPhone version, which goes for $20.*

_____

**FIRE EMBLEM: AWAKENING**

* This is a jRPG in which you try and restore balance in a kingdom plagued with war and the threat of an ancient evil awakening. 

* Characters are given personality through the dialogue and writing right off the bat, with minor characters getting very funny/unique lines of dialogue. Your characters also interact with each other, and can improve their relationships when fought adjacent in battle. These conversations are not only amusing, but enough of them and they can even marry and have kids which take some of the best skills from both fighters. This becomes a surprisingly addicting mini-game of matchmaking.

* Characters are dispensable (besides two pivotal characters) even though they don't seem to be, as there are far too many characters than you could possibly use for every battle. You will find yourself making unwanted sacrifices with *minor* characters in battle and find yourself regretting saving over your files later on. 

* Weapons are lances, swords, magic, bows, axes, and other medieval lore weaponry fodder. They each have a limited use, and break after that number is used up. You must buy or find new weapons to fight with. 

**AVAILABLE FOR: Nintendo 3DS**, *but past games in the series are available on GBA, GB, Wii, GCN, and characters are in Super Smash Bros Brawl &amp; Melee. btw, Marth is a dude in those games. I know.*

That's my end, but I ask friends and read reviews and hear other things:

However, this was about a week before the AOE2HD announcement.

This deluxe edition contained AOE, Rise of Rome, AOE2 and The Conquerors. I have barely been able to play AOFE because unfortunately you need to download a separate edition to play it on Voobly.

Trying to play AOE2: The Conquerors on Voobly is a literal pain in the arse. Lag is very commonplace, worse so than when I used to play Brood War on iCCup and far worse than when I played Starcraft 2 on the KR server.

Anyway, I got a few questions:

1. AOE2HD is £14.99 on Steam. Is it worth purchasing the game again for some improved textures and Steamworks/Steam Workshop support?

2. Is it worth buying it with the AOE3 Complete Edition at £20.99 instead? I liked AOE3 and own the original but none of the expansion packs.

3. What does Steam Workshop support actually entail? Will there be support for full blown mods or will it just be custom maps?

4. Is there any plan for Age of Forgotten Empires to be supported as a mod for AOE2HD?

5. Is Steamworks multiplayer better than using Voobly?

6. How difficult is AOE2HD to mod? I heard AOE2 was virtually impossible to actually produce a fully blown mostly bug/crash free mod for until some Chinese/Taiwanese developers discovered a way back in 2008.

I really enjoyed the experience and was able to share my ""nerdiness"" with her in a very productive way. In short, I want to try playing something else with her, and I've been looking for a game we can both enjoy.

I myself am obsessed with games that involve fun story lines and interesting mechanics (eg Skyrim for depth of story, Portal for mechanics and characters/fun story-line, etc), I consider myself a noob at fast-paced games. In contrast, My gf has little experience with genres, having only ever really played FPS games on her dad's playstation 2/3 and a handful of wii games. from what I've learned she really enjoys ""running up and hitting things"" (she claims to have beaten and entire FPS campaign with her sister almost entirely using melee). She seems to really like Portal 2, especially for GLAdOS (we agree on this) and her favorite mechanics involve blue and orange gels (she still hasn't reached white gel in the single player campaign, and we have not done the post-campaign co-op missions yet). Beyond that I don't know what else to add about our personal interests.

There are also some limitations to what I can buy, we've tried playing video games at each other's places, but this tends not to work out. I have recently found a happy medium through steam, where we're able to play together nights when we would usually only skype. We both really like this system, and it's easy for her to jump into with little hassle on either of our parts. In addition, she only has a mac, so out options on steam are limited to steam play titles.

I've been considering Left 4 Dead (1 or 2?) as it seems to appeal to her approach to shooters, though I'm not sure if this would be my game of choice and the gore might be a turnoff for her (I got her hooked on game of thrones by watching it with her on the condition that I'd cover her eyes before the gory-bits). An ideal game for us imo would have been Orcs Must Die 2, but her mac kind of removes this as an option. So, oh wise and knowledgeable reddit gamers, what should I buy?

TL;DR: I wanna buy a steam-play Co-op game for my girlfriend and I, she likes shooters and melee games, hates gore, I like interesting mechanics and deep story lines, but have horrible reaction time.

OH! PS: We both really love minecraft, but she owns a pirated version and is unable to make online purchases atm (my online buying is limited to steam), so we've never actually been able to play together, but that might happen in the future!",,False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,,True,t3_xqx9u,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/xqx9u/wsib_coop_with_girlfriend/,

I've been a gamer forever, but I've never been to interested in violent games. My favorites have always been platformers or puzzles.

The focus on characters and story, lack of ""you did a bad thing, now I must break your face for justice"" stuff, and the romantic elements especially were really refreshing and fun. I just wish that I could have been female, and that I had more choices to make and a larger effect on the events of the game.

1368621597.0,33,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,1ednk5,YSB: Neverwinter... maybe (F2P MMO),occupy_voting_booth,39,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1ednk5/ysb_neverwinter_maybe_f2p_mmo/,"Don't want to read my wall of text? Here are the high points:

This game is free and you can level to the level cap without much grinding and certainly without spending any money. You can have a lot of fun with this game and never spend a dime.

It is, however, pay to win - so those players who do elect to spend money on this game (and you can definitely spend a ton of money) can purchase all the best companions, equipment, and boosts they want.

Neverwinter is an MMO set in the Dungeons and Dragons universe. I couldn't really tell you much about which version or universe or whatever because I don't know much about D&amp;D, but it hasn't stopped me from enjoying the game immensely.

I can totally see how this game isn't for everyone, but if either of the following two things apply to you, you should absolutely check this game out:

You have a group of 2-5 friends who will playing with you. (This makes the game a slam dunk) and / or you actually ENJOY traditional MMO trappings like daily quests, dungeon runs, tanks and healers, 'tiered' armor sets, questing, etc.

The combat is my favorite part of the game. It has a 'free aim' combat system, where you actually control a reticule with the mouse and 'aim' it at your intended target. When the target's in your sight, you either click left or right mouse or one of the Q, E, R ,or number keys to enact your ability upon your target (friend or foe). 

It feels pretty good and it actually makes the game play somewhere between something like The Secret World and Diablo (or any other ARPG). 

I think the game looks pretty good, too. The armor and weapons are a little tamer than what you'd find in WoW or any of the asian MMOs, and a lot of the gear looks the same for first 20-30 levels, but all the gear is nicely detailed and I never had too much of a problem with how my character looks. The game environments themselves are pretty nice, actually. It tends to favor smaller, more instanced zones with a nice level of detail over large sprawling (and sometimes empty) zones that you experience in other MMOs.

Character animations are another of the games strong suits. You can tell as early as the character creation screen that a good deal of work went into smoothly animated the characters and I think that coupled with the impressive particle effects on the abilities gives the combat a pretty exciting feel.

You can have companions that follow you around and help in combat, they can be human or animal (there's a pretty decent selection), they can serve a healing, tank, or DPS role, and they will level up as you play more.

Crafting is wild. It's really more akin to a mobile game. You queue up your crafting projects, which can range from 5 seconds to 8+ hours. They will complete themselves whether you're logged in or not. In fact, you can even craft on your character without logging into the game at the Neverwinter Gateway. As of right now, crafting isn't really essential, but I've been doing it anyway. Most of the gear isn't very useful, but it's something to do while I'm at work.

Okay, those are some of the high points, here are some of the lows:

This game is definitely pay to win, but it isn't pay to have fun. ALL GEAR is Bind of Equip in this game, so you can theoretically find all of the best equipment for sale in the auction house. The auction house currency (astral diamonds) can be purchased with Zen points, which are purchased with real money. Therefore, yes, you can buy the best items in the game with real money. I have played to level 25 and 20 (two different characters) I haven't spent a dime and it hasn't affected my enjoyment of the game thusfar, but I can see how this will come into play later on.

AFK'ers in PVP are another big problem. There is no AFK timer in PVP and people (sometimes entire pre-made groups) will just AFK through PVP and get the rewards for participating. I can only imagine this will be fixed soon as it seems like more of an oversight than anything.

If you don't have people you'll be grouping with, I could see it feeling a little lonely. One of the things I love the most about this game is how much instanced content there is. You can do skirmishes, and dungeons, and even regular questing areas will frequently send you into instanced areas to clear out a cave, or a house, or a castle, and these areas have great detail and even a little light exploration - BUT - if you're playing solo, the world may feel a little empty to you and I could see this being a negative to someone looking for an ""MMO"" experience.

It's actually more of a long movie than a game. That being said, this game is amazing.

The main reason to buy this game is for the story. It can be extremely suspenseful at times, especially on the hard difficulty. Some scenes were downright horrifying for me, especially towards the end. It may start off a little slowly, but that just serves to characterize everyone into actual *people.* All the characters are more than just cardboard cutouts, they feel like they could actually be *real.* It makes the scenes all the more intense because you can sympathize with them.

What I found interesting is the fact that each of the four playable characters can die. Permanently. If you screw up, that character's story is over. Thankfully, the game is usually pretty forgiving, allowing you to make a few mistakes in a row before death. But once your character is dead, any clues they may have are gone with them, and the end level/epilogues will pan out differently than if they had survived.

The gameplay isn't much, as most of it is quick-time events. Most events require a combination of button pressing, stick movement, and/or controller swinging. But they are used exceptionally well, and never felt unnatural in the context of the game.

All being said, Heavy Rain is an excellent game, and is worth your time and money if you are a fan of suspense in games.

TL;DR Heavy Rain has an amazingly suspenseful story, great characters, perma-death, and intuitive controls. It's worth the money.

I'm very interested in both games but there are also certain points which make it difficult for me to choose.

Borderlands 2:

I played Borderlands 1 for a few hours but got quickly bored of it because I spent all my time running around in this wasteland area where all levels looked the same. In addition, the story was presented very lame (just some wall of text with barely any voice acting, seriously?). Gameplay was very fun though.
So have these points been improved in Borderlands 2? Can I expect a more interesting looking world with lots of different settings and a story which is presented decently?

Dark Souls

I really like the setting and the idea of the player venturing through the world all by himself, feeling a bit isolated. However, everyone says the game is freakishly hard at first but once you start to adapt to the game's mechanics and don't rush in, you'll get a pretty decent gaming experience. Now the thing is, I'm a rather impatient gamer: If I am stuck in a certain part, I'll try a few solutions but when those don't work, I usually get annoyed and look for a walkthrough (though sometimes I get ambitious and try harder but this is rarely the case). I also wouldn't consider myself a pro-gamer (or whatever you wanna call it) so I'm not sure if my skills are even good enough for the game (in case they have to be, that is).
So the question is, will I have fun with this game or should I just stick with Borderlands 2?

And if that wasn't enough, I'm also wondering if my PC can handle both games. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600, 4 GB RAM and a Geforce 9800GTX. Canyourunit.com says the setup would handle both games fine but I somehow don't trust this page since it also told me I couldn't play Dishonored which I did with highest settings.

So that's it, I hope I'm not too confusing with my gibberish.",,False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,,True,t3_11yp9w,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/11yp9w/sib_dark_souls_or_borderlands_2_both_pc/,

Ok so essentially the game is an ""interactive story."" A haunting story. A story that will touch your mind, and your heart. 

Now see I'm not one to cry over any old thing, but after playing this game, it was raining indoors, seas of onions were being chopped right under my nose, and my eyes were sweating like they had just ran a marathon. This story will break your heart and mend it all while the music delightfully lays your ears down to rest in a bed of the softest linens. 

Now for one negative. The ""humor,"" while great when used correctly, was often thrown in at very emotional times. Nothing sent me crashing down back to Earth (heh, back to Earth from the moon, cuz I went ""To The Moon."" GET IT?! Sorry that was a little hypocritical) harder than a mistimed joke.

That being said. Buy this game.

1355030117.0,29,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,14j9st,YSB Killing Floor,Kovukono,39,10,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/14j9st/ysb_killing_floor/,"If you're looking for a cooperative shooter, you almost certainly can't go wrong with Killing Floor. The game offers an amazing amount of depth for a shooter, with the higher levels requiring teamwork and coordination if the team has any hope of surviving. There's tons of maps, tons of weapons, and free content at least twice a year. It's easy to pour literally hundreds of hours into this game with the sheer amount of entertainment it gives you.

**Gameplay:** Each match is split up into ten waves with one final boss wave. Each wave has a certain number of enemies out for your blood, the number varying on the number of players in the game. Up to six players can fight off the specimens at a time, with the number of players having the potential to change the entire strategy for the match. As the waves go on, more specimens are added each round, and with different and more difficult types being introduced as the waves go by, for a total of nine different variations. Killing any specimen has the potential to activate zed time as well, Damaging any specimen or healing your teammates gets you money. If at least one player manages to survive the wave, anyone who died respawns and they all have the opportunity to buy weapons and ammo. Survive ten waves and kill the boss, and the match is over.

**Perks:** Every player must choose a perk to play, and can choose a new perk at the beginning of each round. Each perk gives you better damage with a particular type of weapon, a discount on those weapons, and often a secondary effect. The commando, for example, uses automatic rifles and has the ability to see any enemy's remaining health. The support specialist uses shotguns and has the ability to weld doors shut faster than any perk. The medic uses guns that shoot healing darts and can heal any teammate more than any other perk. Each of the seven perks has seven levels, each level giving you increased bonuses for that perk. In order for you to compete in higher difficulties, it's almost required to have higher-level perks.

**Maps and Content**: So far, 23 separate maps have been released as official Tripwire Entertainment maps. Each map has five difficulties, from the easy ""Beginner"" capable of being beaten by anyone to the extremely difficult ""Hell on Earth,"" requiring that your skills be sharp and your perk levels be high. In addition to the official maps, there are tons of community maps as well. Each summer and winter (and it's beginning to look like each Halloween, too), Tripwire offers up new maps, a new skin for their players, and may even offer free weapons. as well. Of all of these maps and over forty weapons, the only game-affecting DLC they ever offered is four weapons, the rest of it being free. If you'd like to stand out, they also offer (at the time of writing) ten different character skin packs that you can buy.

It's difficult to put into words just what makes Killing Floor so great. Finishing any map successfully is hair-raising and difficult, with plenty of close calls. The enemy variation works excellently to attempt to break down your team's defenses. Beating each map on its toughest difficulty is a challenge for anyone. As said before, there's potentially hundreds of hours of content in the game, and the game often goes on sale for as low as 75% during its seasonal events (one coming up in just a week or two) and always hits that low during Steam seasonal sales. If you're worried about finding people for the matches, there's almost always over a hundred servers with players on them, and it's consistently one of the top 100 games on Steam. If you're looking for a shooter that you can pour tons of time to over the next Steam Sale, check out Killing Floor.",[Steam],False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,gold,True,t3_14j9st,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/14j9st/ysb_killing_floor/,
1352421075.0,30,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,12vxqu,YSB Dark Souls,Kovukono,33,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/12vxqu/ysb_dark_souls/,"Dark Souls is a game that absolutely deserves its tagline ""Prepare to Die."" The game demands near-perfection from its players while giving them a level of freedom unparalleled by most games. It's not an especially hard game, but it's punishing and cruel, and the difficulty ensures that it's not for everyone. Patience is needed as you learn the weaknesses and layout of the levels, but the feeling of reward that you get for overcoming an area or a boss is something you can get from few games. The difficulty is entirely structured so that players can beat it even at level 1, each enemy being capable of being defeated by skill alone. There are some parts that feel cheap, but almost every time you die it's because you messed up--and you can name why you died.

The game is set in the fantasy world of Lordran, where you'll find few sane inhabitants compared to the large amount of demons and monsters standing in your way. The story put in front of you is very limited--you're tasked with restoring the Flame to Lordran, and must collect the Lordvessel and the souls of those who tasted of the First Flame. Other than this, there's no real motivation behind the player's quest that the game explicitly gives you. However, where it really shines are the subtle subplots that it presents through interaction with the characters. The dialogue they have and the hints left around the environment flesh them out and make them full characters.

The environment presented helps immensely, with no two places quite the same, be it the swamps of Blighttown, the beautiful city of Anor Londo, the pitch-black Catacombs, or Darkroot Forest. Each area has different enemies and new secrets to explore. Each boss has their own feel as well, presenting a different fight and an entirely different set of ways to make your life hell. There's tons to explore and uncover, especially if you don't use a guide. A first playthrough will likely take upwards of fifty hours, and you can replay it with all your weapons and stats again and again to get more weapons, spells, uncover secrets you missed, and play it for an even greater challenge.

The gameplay is also another solid hook. You have complete control over what character you would like to make, and you can use any weapon or playstyle you'd prefer. You could be a ranged character, taking out enemies with poisoned arrows, a mage versed in a wide variety of spells, a flame-tossing pyromancer, a miracle-casting cleric, a backstabbing rogue, a meaty tank with a huge broadsword, or a mixture of any of these. Almost every playstyle is viable. On top of the playstyles, there's a wide variety of weapons that can be used, along with a good number of upgrade paths that can be used to make your weapon that you've used for your playstyle to be upgraded to fit with your stats. In addition to that, defeated bosses often drop souls that can be used to create unique weapons.

In addition to the fantastic single-player, there's also a robust amount of options for multiplayer. Unlike just about any other game where multiplayer is a separate mode entirely, in Dark Souls multiplayer occurs while you're playing single-player. You can summon players for help from the signs they have placed, be invaded by other players intent on your murder, or lay down signs to challenge others to a duel. There are covenents in game to help the players, each one of them allowing for different player interactions. The Sunlight Warriors (more commonly known as Sunbros) rely on helping other players. Darkwraiths invade players, and are subsequently hunted by the Darkmoons. The Forest Hunters protect a certain area from any and all players who set foot inside. The Gravelords work to make your journey even harder, putting super-powered enemies in the world until you find them. There are others as well, each offering a different brand of player interaction. If you're worried about these covenants affecting your playthrough however, you can opt out of them by simply remaining Hollow, though you will be unable to summon any help.

I imagine a lot of the questions that people have about it are regarding the PC version. It does have issues as a port, the biggest one being the controls. If you're going to buy it, it's highly suggested that you get a PS3 or Xbox 360 controller. After that, you can [download DSfix](http://darksouls.nexusmods.com/mods/19), a mod that unlocks all of the graphical beauty of Dark Souls that the consoles had restricted and allows a lot more options than the in-game menu. The multiplayer does have some issues as well, as quite often summonings or invasions fail. You must also be online and logged into GFWL to play, or your game will not save. There's also been reports of cheaters using trainers and hacks, with GFWL simply not caring (though personally, I haven't encountered any issues).

Despite these issues, it's well worth the cost, especially if you plan on buying it this weekend at $27. The PvP is alive and well when you know where to look, and there's often players ready to help in just about any area. There's a decent amount of mods available (check out /r/darksoulsmods for some examples) and the number is still growing, so if customization is your thing, there's options there as well. The DLC bundled with the PC version is also fantastic, delivering the best boss of the DSouls series yet and a world that's immensely challenging and offers a brand new kind of magic. If you don't mind the challenge and are intrigued by the premise, you should absolutely grab the game--you won't regret it.",,False,,t5_2ud8h,1352421276.0,,gold,True,t3_12vxqu,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/12vxqu/ysb_dark_souls/,

(Recently Green-lit on steam),StinkyWes,33,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/13yojd/sib_miasmata_recently_greenlit_on_steam/,"I saw this game has just been released on Steam for £10.79 (not sure in USD) and wondered if anybody has given it a go? Is it worth said price?

I do enjoy survival games (MC, Don't Starve, Terraria) along with First Person games.

**EDIT - MY EXPERIENCE WITH MIASMATA:** I went ahead and bought the game. I'm around about 2 hours into the game now, and there are definitely lot's of pro's and con's. I haven't got into a fight with that lion/goat thing yet.

**Let's start of with the pro's:**

-*Cartography system*: Wow. This really has been pulled off really well. You have to actually use landmarks on the map (which you draw when you find... I guess map segments). This adds a real sense of realism that really makes you feel like you're reading a map IRL (well.. duh!)

-*Music*: The music is really calming, though doesn't always play (which is probably a good thing). It reminds me of some of the slower songs from TES:Oblivion, and really adds to the atmosphere.

-*Gameplay*: For the most part, the gameplay is really fun and has interesting systems. The way you make potions is fun, and only being able to hold *three* items really makes it better as you only carry what's important. Other things also add to the fun.

-*Wildlife/Scenery*: There is a lot going on around you in this game. Birds, butterflies, frogs and squirrels are among many things you'll see wandering the island. The trees/grass are all animated really well and the realistic art style fits very well.

**Now for the cons:**

-*Sound effects*: Some of the sound effects are pretty decent, but majority of them don't sound great at all. More of a nitpick rather than a reason not to get the game, however.

-*Slopes*: OK, so granted your character IS ill, but really, it is so hard to climb even slight inclines in this game. It got pretty annoying after a while.

-*Graphics Settings*: The graphics are nice, but if you have a low end PC, you may not want to try it. My PC is mid-range (eg, runs BF3 on medium at about 30fps), and I run this game at around 25fps on high settings. There are only two settings for all graphics options, High and Low. When switching to Low, the game crashed, and upon restarting everything went haywire. I had to change graphics back to high then restart the game in order to play again.

-*FOV/Character Control*: The FOV (field of view) in this game is pretty small, and I don't think there is a way to change it. Low FOV on PC games makes me a tad queasy, so hopefully this get's added. Regarding character control, it feels sluggish. Moving around isn't nice, and it's hard to maneuver over small objects or slopes. Just looking around feels, well, not great.

-*Water*: Let me start off by saying the water in this game looks *amazing*! However, it only looks amazing at short distances. Even though the water effect is nice, as are the reflections on it, at a distance it looks as though there is way too much going on and looks pretty horrible.

**Overall Verdict:**
This game IS fun, but there are bugs and annoyances. I would say I'm leaning towards it is worth the price, though I think you may be able to get it cheaper elsewhere (GOG.com). From what I can tell from other reviews, the fighting the monster is reasonable (again I haven't met it yet). If my problems with the graphics settings are not just for me, I would wait for some sort of fix first (unless it goes on sale). I am also hoping that there will be many things added into the game like more graphics options/FOV/etc... but I am unaware of it's current build so it may be complete or it may be in Alpha.

So yes, this game is worth it (in my opinion, others may disagree), but only if you can put up with some bugs and annoyances.

I'll say 6.5-7/10 - would be more if less bugs, but gameplay is solid for the most part.

It's from the same developers who made Resonance and Gemini Rue (about which I already wrote [a YSB](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/ymkld/ysb_gemini_rue/) ). Those games share some similarities and I really think that the developer, Wadjet Eye Games, deserves some more attention because they have been doing a pretty good job so far. But let's get to the Blackwell Bundle, shall we?

The Blackwell Bundle consists of the 4 episodes Legacy, Unbound, Convergence and Deception.
Each episode is about 2-4 hours long. They tell the story of Rosangela Blackwell, a freelance journalist, who makes her money by writing book reviews for a local newspaper. One day she gets to know Joey Mallone. Joey's a ghost, who passed away in the 1930s and he tells her that she's a medium, meaning that she can see and communicate with ghosts who are trapped in the world of the mortals. Now it's up to Rosangela and Joey to help those ghosts meet their peace and depart to the afterlife because, according to Joey, that's something her aunt and before that her grandmother have already been doing.

The story is really interesting and captivating and the characters are well written; you can easily connect with both Rosangela and Joey. The dialogues are also fun to listen to, the voice acting is really good for such a production with a relatively low budget.
The gameplay focuses on investigating the deaths and backgrounds of the numerous ghosts you'll meet throughout the game. You'll spend most of the time talking to people and observing your surroundings. You can talk about certain subjects which are listed in your notebook and you can try to connect two subjects in order to create a new subject, which will then lead you to a new person or a new location. Classic puzzles where you have to collect items to solve a certain problem are rather rare and they are also easy, as the locations are small and have a low amount of objects to interact with, making the game overall enjoyable to persons new to the genre.
The graphics are not the strong point of the game; they do their job but if you fancy 3D graphics and aren't used to the nostalgic look of older adventure games, you might not like the game. One aspect where the game really shines, apart from its story, is the music though. Boy, that music alone is worth the 15$. Every track catches the mood of the scene perfectly and I often wound up staying in a location a few minutes longer than I needed to, just so I could listen to the music. It really is that good.

Taking platforming back to it's ridiculously hard roots, it's at around level 7 that the game starts to feel really hard. Fixing what was originally bad about the original platformers, like glitchiness and bad controls, the game not only improves on them in every way, but is also more parkour-based, forcing you to mash your keyboard until you get to where you want.

On completion of every level, you get to see your failures and success, all as if it were one single life. On a particularly hard level, you might see something like 70 meat boys, all trying and failing to reach the end of the level. As you play through Edmund McMillen's creation, you're not just enriching yourself in the gameplay. The game has an amazing soundtrack composed by Danny B, and the storyline, although just a few short cutscenes, creates characters and gives the game that polished feel.

Once you have beaten the final level, your journey is not nearly complete. From here, you can go on to 100% the game, which involves beating every level within a certain time, collecting all of the unlockable bandages and characters, and then going on to complete the dark world, which is every level in the game with added death traps.

If that isn't enough to quench your thirst for completion of this amazing game, you can go on to play 'the internets' section, where there are thousands of user-created levels. Just click 'enter the unknown' to have a randomly generated chapter ready and waiting for you to mash through it.

You can get the game on Steam and XBLA, or if you bought the Humble Indie Bundle 4, you will already have a copy waiting to be installed. Trust me, you'll never regret this one.

How is Alpha Centauri compared to this?


Also, I'm aware it is an older game. Like, pretty damned old. So I'm afraid that the user interface coupled with how complicated the game is (complexity aside) will alienate me from enjoying it. 

How easy is it to get into? Will I become bored/frustrated with it? Is it to spreadsheet-y? Will I lose my patience trying to have fun with it? How hard is it?

I'm mostly aware about the differences/similarities with Minecraft , but I do have my concerns. Most importantly, what encourages you to keep playing? Other than finding different colored blocks for your buildings, what is the inspiration to explore the world?

Do people mostly play multiplayer? I'm assuming it gets quite lonely playing alone unless you are really passionate about creating your own buildings/town from scratch. Even then of course it would be more fun if you had friends to help with the labor. However, based on research it seems like it's not simple to set up a private multiplayer game. Do people join public games to help them with their projects? Enlighten me!

Also, does the game ever go on sale? It's seems pretty pricey at $27. I can afford it but it'll be hard to convince my mates to pay the same price.





PS. I know someone else has asked this game recently, but he was being a douche because he was comparing it with the pirate version; and hence didn't get any good replies that were useful to me.

It is not.  As far as I can tell, it has nothing to do with the original devs, and is a clumsy game besides.*

The physics simulation is extremely inconsistent and clunky. Behaviour is drastically different from test to test, but one thing that is consistent is that perfectly symmetrical structures are inexplicably stressed close to breaking on one side and not the other. Parts break, the UI gives little indication of what or why, the strength of materials is not intuitive or easy to explore. And even ignoring the maddenning inconsistencies, the physics model is unforgiving, the tolerances vanishingly low, and it's just not as fun to play with as the genuine Pontifex games.

The interface gets in the way more often than not, and doesn't seem to be based on a consistent state model (""Select Mode"" is a mess). After playing for 2 hours, I still couldn't tell whether the next click would place a part, select a part, do nothing, bring up a menu, or switch modes. It's missing hotkeys for common tasks. Many polished UI considerations that were perfectly solved problems in Pontifex II seem to have been thrown out.

From a little research, the devs who wrote our beloved Pontifex and Pontifex II/Bridge Construction Set seem to have absolutely nothing to do with this game. I haven't been able to figure out why it's listed on the [Chronic Logic website](http://www.chroniclogic.com/), but it seems to be 100% the work of a trio of shady German shovelware companies. I bought it based on that association (ie: I thought it was a Chronic Logic game), which was my mistake since this claim appears nowhere else.

I would recommend just replaying an old copy of Pontifex/Pontifex II/BCS. Definitely not worth $20.",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,1366662293.0,,,True,t3_1cvpmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1cvpmc/ysnb_bridge_project/,

Recently, we've kinda been letting you users roam free with your threads, generating your own content to help each other out. But, us guys over on the Mod Team have been interested in implementing a sort of contest ever since Gamer of the Week died out. So, without further adue, I present to you:

**Let's Try A Contest: Write A YSB!**

----

**Rules**

----

It's a fairly simlpe contest, all we want to do is we want you all to make a YSB/YSNB/YSP/YSNP on any game ever made, as long as it still obtainable in a legal form. Just make sure that the post is as informative as it can be, long flowing sentences, really helpful (and unbiased) points, and detailed descriptions really help. Feel free to add in your own personal experience as well (without spoilers!) and make sure it's a great representation of your work and the game you are writing about. Once you've written the YSB, [send me a PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=TriAft) with a link to your YSB. 

And it's simple as that! :)

----

**Prizes**

----

**This contest is a test run for future contests to see how well you guys percieve it and how much user participation we recieve.** That being said, we will still have prizes, though they will not be as impressive as future contests may have.

The three most impressive YSBs as chosen by myself and the others on the r/SIBTG mod team will recieve **one of three ArmA III Alpha lite keys** for your enjoyment and will be featured on the sidebar of the subreddit.

**Contest ends on March 30th.**

NOTE: *ArmA III Alpha lite keys only work during the Alpha and Beta stages of the game. This does NOT allow you to play the full game, merely the Alpha and Beta stages. The reason for this prize is that since this contest is a test run, the prizes will not be as spectacular as they might be in the future.*

Maybe you've even thought about buying the game yourself to see what all the fuss is about. And just possibly, you've thrown the idea away because it sounds too ""hardcore.""

SHUT YO' FRICKIN' TRAP AND BUY THE STUPID GAME.
Now, I say stupid with all of the love in the world. In fact, it's far from stupid, it's FRIGGIN' BRILLIANT. Anyone who likes/loves RPGs should grab this game the next time there's a sale. HELL, you should pick it up at full price.

Let's start with the combat. Grade. Fucking. A. It's simple as far as action RPGs go, but has enough potential with magic, traps, and throwables that you can either utilize all the potential, or just hack and slash your way through with no hindrance either way. Being able to watch all the stats play out in the combat box adds another level and see how different equipment affects your defense and offense. The limited spells is a little disappointing, but it simplifies memorizing which symbol stands for which spell. The weapon wheel/spell selection is pretty boss too; instead of searching through menus for your weapon sets, you set it up before the battle, and switch between 2 weapons during combat, and can set up to 8 throwables. Downsides, you are limited in spells and weapons during combat.
9/10

Characters. Now, I haven't played the original Witcher, but after the prologue, the main characters started feeling friendly and familiar. The voice acting's a little over the top at times, but what video game really has perfect acting? Even the smaller NPCs are enjoyable to listen to. Overall, a 10/10.

Crafting/Alchemy. HOLY BALL SHIT. This is where this review spawned. The crafting and alchemy systems are simple, yet have enough depth that you might spend 2-3 hours at a time just running around grabbing ingredients for potions and weapon/mod crafts. YOU CAN TAKE EVERYTHING! You see some timber you need, just walk up and grab till there ain't no more to grab. You need some iron? Same story, different merchant. Now, if you want to make some powerful items, you gotta kill creatures. Lots of creatures. Creatures that respawn. SLAUGHTER ALL THE NONHUMANS!... Unlike Skyrim where you had a skill for making things, and you could potentially break the game by grinding low level crafts, as long as you have a recipe and the goods, you're set for a day of crafting without worrying you'll OP the game.
10/10

NOW WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR!?

The question becomes: what should I buy that's different from these? Doesn't have to even necessarily be single player, just different. Borderlands, Skyrim, Just Cause, racing games are all no-goes for me. I just recently got done playing Dust: An Elysian Tail and have messed with Anno 2070 a bit, but I feel like it's not really my thing. I've been interested in the L4D series, but I honestly feel like i'm not missing much other than a shoot-em-up in bulk. Never played Half-Life but from what i've seen it just doesn't really interest me. 


As you can see, I've thought this out a solid amount and you guys are my last resort! I just want to be able to enjoy a fun, solid game without having the stresses of my usual ones. Thanks in advance. 

EDIT: Available platforms are xbox 360 and PC. Rachet and Clank and Jak and Dexter games interest me, since i remember having a ton of fun playing them but never got around to all of them. Any more modern versions of these games, or games similar? I've heard good things about Banjoo-kazoie or however you spell it, but never really understood what it was about.

The game's art style is very cool, examples can be scrolled through here ; http://goo.gl/3bceV . The sound design and music is incredible, with my personal favourite part being the mission music which helps me to think, it doesn't intrude on the strategy of the levels yet still manages to make the combat sections tense somehow, a phenomenal achievement in my eyes.

The achievements and dialogue choices are all funny, such as a personal favourite where the description of the achievement is ""Notice that the story doesn't gel with the mechanics of the game. Become Qualified Games Journalist."" I laughed when I saw that in my achievements list.

The level editor is very fun to use, I have made a couple of serious levels and a few impossible ones and they are always fun to make. 
The gadgets and abilities are also really fun, although the gatecrashers ability to kick open almost any door without using any battery, ruins replaying some of the levels. I ended up selling it back after the last mission. Speaking of that, all purchases can be sold back after any mission for the price you bought them for. This lets you decide on your favourite abilities and it has a test lab as well, to help you decipher the worthy competitors for best ability.

It is overall a great, hilarious game, with loads of pop-culture references, great gameplay and polished mechanics, varying levels, good puzzles, great replayability and an excellent level editor, and at 10 dollars (aud) or your regional equivalent, it is more than worth your time.
My only downside is that the campaign missions can be done in around 2-3 hours if you're good, but the replayability comes from the ratings and times for each levels, along with the tantalising achievement of beating Tom Francis at a level, which I got before the end of the game ( http://goo.gl/Ca8z )

This game is awesome. Reus intrigued me from the start (maybe it's the fact that we haven't seen many god games in a while, or maybe it's that Reus does things in a 2D perspective. Dunno). It's different than anything I've ever played before and kind of reminds me of a ton of different things, including the Civilization series, some parts of Spore, stuff like Sim Earth, and many others. There's a few different things I really like about Reus, so I'm just going to list them out:

* The Sound design. Reus has some very, very catchy music that I was humming for days after playing it. Also, the game just includes a few nice things like some of the sfx changing whenever you hover over different tiles, etc.
* Very interesting ability systems. In Reus, you play as the planet, and you control the earth using different Giants. Different tiles are upgraded using different ""aspects"" (upgrade path type abilities) that your giants can acquire many different ways, that also have many different effects on the game (aspects transform plants and animals into different types. ""Herd"" aspects will transform things like chicken into deer. Predator aspects transform things like turtles into snakes). Different things in tiles are all affected by whatever's in the tiles around them as well, through symbiosis effects. It's kind of complicated to explain, but you get the hang of it fairly quickly once you start to play.

* Accomplishing different feats in the game is extremely rewarding!! The game is constantly throwing new, difficult challenges at you, and if you want to succeed at them, you have to figure out how to adapt your play style, while also using the skills you've learned even more effectively than before. Most of the different elements in Reus follow  the same rule: easy to learn, difficult to master. I can't stress enough how rewarding I felt Reus was, while I was finding new ways to improve and accomplish the many challenges in the game, and I always wanted to find new ways to use the game's interesting systems to my advantage. 

So yeah. Reus is a great game, and you'll find it's something you can really sink your teeth into, if you're the kind of person that gets really into games, or loves simulation/god games. I had a ton of fun, and I think now I'm gonna have to go find more games like it :)

For those familiar with Behemoth (Alien Hominid, Castle Crashers), this is their third game that they have been working on forever.

The main game is a 2D platformer that can be played either solo or co-op (with the levels slightly altered).  The plot is pretty simple, but the levels have that old-school vibe and are a blast.

The multiplayer is somewhat similar to Smash Bros. fighting with different objectives. It makes a great party game and has some utterly ridiculous modes (ex. Capture the Horse, like CTF but with square ""horses you have to ride back to your base).  My only recommendation I would make is to make sure you are playing humans, since the AI is pretty stupid.

But hands down the past part is the announcer.  I don't know where they found this guy, but every single one of his lines is hilarious. His commentary makes the game the funniest one I've heard since Portal 2.  For example, just listen to him in [the trailer](http://youtu.be/ohtLy9wict0), or in the [secret level theme.](http://youtu.be/LawPej_s6Ak)

The basic idea of the game is that you are a badass ninja who starts on floor 350 of a tower and descends to the bottom, fighting enemies and bosses at set levels as you go down. The game is procedurally generated and has permadeath of sorts (5 health that is upgradable, 2 continues), so the replayability of the game is very high.

The game is challenging without feeling impossible. It is similar to Dark Souls in the way of once you learn aspects of the game, you begin to breeze through parts that were once stopping blocks. The game to me plays like an amalgamation of NES Ninja Gaiden, Mega Man X, Super Meat Boy, and Hotline Miami, with lots of bits of other games sprinkled in.

Each kill increases a rage meter, which gives you temporary invincibility when it's filled, but is always going down. This increases your score as well, so you are encouraged to go quickly. If you've played Hotline Miami and know the feeling when you get into the zen state where everything works out, that is this game at its best when you are destroying enemies left and right, jumping over spike pits, and clearing 100+ floors without taking a hit.

Along with being procedurally generated, there are tons of unlocks to strive to get, and they greatly vary the play experience and increase replayability. There are 10+ different unlockable choices for each weapon of your starting loadout - weapon, ranged weapon, bomb, and magic(4 choices for magic). Getting tired of katana/shurikens? Play through with a whip/axe instead for a Castlevania throwback. You also can unlock various things like increased item limits, item pickups, and cosmetic changes. Probably 100 unlocks in all.

The sound in the game is great, and the visuals are crisp and look great even when you're racing through the levels. This is a game I picked up on a whim and I've found to be an absolute gem. At less than 5 bucks right now, it is definitely a steal, highly recommended.",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,1361392384.0,,,True,t3_18whpj,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/18whpj/ysb_super_house_of_dead_ninjas_30_off_on_steam/,

This little indie game is part of Steam's Linux sale for the next week (http://store.steampowered.com/app/107200/) and I am debating if I should pick it up.  I am wondering if anyone else has played it, and could give a general opinion of the game?

I have been debating an FTL purchase as well, as I have viewed a few Let's Plays and it looks very fun.  I like the idea of tactical space combat - SPAZ looks a little more hectic.

Based upon the beta trailer (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpW1PGLVdnE) it looks like a fairly involved game.  The gameplay itself (what you actually do) looks pretty basic, however.  Do you feel that there is enough ""game"" to merit a purchase?

Overall, it looks pretty fun, but I'd really like some extra input!


**EDIT:** To anyone else who is considering a purchase, the developers have a fairly comprehensive demo available on their website (http://www.spacepiratesandzombies.com/demo.html) which takes you through the tutorial.

This week, because I'm not a corrupt mod, [I had to not give myself the YSB Award.](http://redd.it/11fhbq) :c But, the post that did win was so good that it made me feel good to give it to them. The post eloquently showed why exactly we should buy a game and expressed all the fine points that a YSB should show. But, the amazing part was that he didn't only convince us about one game, but about four games. The work that needed to be done to describe all four games in a bundle really shows the dedication this person has to getting good games out there, and for that, I thank you. So, I present the YSB Legend Award to /u/Falukoorv for his [super special awesome post about the Blackwell Bundle!](http://redd.it/11ikwn) Good work Fal!

________


**Gameplay** - In Reus, you have to earn three different resources. Food, Gold and Tech. Nothing out of the ordinary here. However, there are lots and lots of variables of how much you get from it. Let me break it down a bit.

You have 4 different Giants. Each of these Giants creates a different Biome (forest, swamp, mountain+desert or water). These Giants can create different food, tech or gold tiles. However, these act differently on different biomes. For instance, if you let your God of Wa(te)r create an animal nest, it would give rats in the desert, frogs in the swamp, chickens in the forest, goats in the mountain, and fish in the sea. Same goes for creating plants.

On top of that, all of these act differently when placed next to other tiles, it can achieve 'symbiosis', working together for best results.

To make it even more difficult, you can upgrade your tiles in different ways. But, if you upgrade something, there's a big chance the symbiosis gets lost. You'd have to redesign the layout for your new tile.

There are even more factors which play into it, like 'natura' and 'awe', but I think I have already lost most of you in the depth this provides. Just believe me, there is a hell of a lot depth into it.

All of this is entirely mouse-driven, but you could use your keyboard in 'DotA/LoL-style' where 'QWER' trigger certain skills. These skills can be earned by getting new Ambassadors onto your Gods.

There's also some sense of progression. You unlock different upgrades, and if you unlock enough upgrades (or 'developments') you gain a level. There are two levels to be gained (three in total) which open up new developments and new 'game modes' (essentially a difference between a 30 minute, 60 minute or 120 minute game)

**Graphics** - A very decent 2D art style, nothing too difficult, but if zoomed in all the way, it still looks good. Reminds me of a very elaborate flash game, but better. It gets the job done, so to say.

1367625988.0,25,self.ShouldIbuythisgame,1dngz2,YSB Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon 3DS,Tortimer,29,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1dngz2/ysb_luigis_mansion_dark_moon_3ds/,"I enjoyed Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. 

The original Luigi's Mansion launched with the GameCube. It is/was a great game, but there are a few differences in gameplay that very much make the new one dissimilar.

**The Story:** Instead of Luigi winning a giant haunted mansion in a fake contest, Luigi has been forced to help Professor E. Gadd wrangle up mean ghosts in many smaller mansions while searching for pieces of the Dark Moon (classic Nintendo trope, something magical broke into pieces and you have to find each piece in a different world).


**Gameplay:** you have a vacuum that sucks up ghosts, money, and bed sheets just like in the first one. Flash ghosts with your flashlight(manually) to stun them to make them vulnerable to your suckage. Scour every room to collect money and you will get automatic upgrades to your vacuum (nothing too crazy, just slightly more powerful or longer lasting battery in your flashlight). You also obtain a black light that will reveal invisible items/areas, so expect to be shinning it on every single thing you ever see in the game.

There was a fair amount of puzzle solving in the game, but honestly most of it can just be bypassed. Maybe if you absolutely despise puzzles and think they are the bane of everything then... well you probably don't like most video games anyway.


**Differences:** In the original the ghosts had more personality. There were a lot of ghosts that had some kind of backstory and at least looked like people. This made the game more interesting/creepier/dark because you could easily infer that they used to be living people but had died. **This game is a lot less spooky than the first**. People don't really seem to remember that the original was actually kinda spooky. The mansion was essentially a giant Resident Evil 1 mansion, and every time you went into a new room the lights would be off. The only way to turn on the lights was to completely clear the room of everything. Pretty much all the rooms are super bright in this new game. The room is bright when you enter, gets momentarily super bright when you clear all ghosts, then goes back to regular bright. I also remember everything being a lot dustier and abandoned feeling. These new ghosts must clean a lot more often.

One huge change that they made is that each mansion is considered a level. Inside each level there are about 7 or so chapters. Once you complete a chapter you can go back and replay it at anytime with your current gear (think resident evil 5). Also like RE:5, you are ranked on how well you did based on time completion, gold collected, ghosts vacuumed, and health loss. There's also a ""secret"" Boo hidden in each level that you may have missed the first time. Really the only reason to replay a level is if you want to 100% the game.




**Pros:** 

* It's Luigi's Mansion. If you loved the first and own a 3DS, then you probably already own this game.
* I enjoy exploring intricate buildings and finding secrets in video games, and that is precisely what Luigi's mansion has to offer.
* Honestly the best 3D that I have seen in a 3DS title so far. Every other game either makes my eyes sore or it feels like they were trying to rely on it too heavily and it appears gimmicky. I really can't praise it enough.
* Some decent slapstick humor.
* I remember being so amazed by the physics in the original, especially by the paper/money that would fly around getting sucked into your vacuum. It looks pretty much the same in this game, and it is even better with 3D turned on.


**Cons:** 

* Purposely took everything that could be considered spooky out of the game. 
* I personally liked the larger giant mansion opposed to the many smaller mansions. You got a lot more satisfaction getting into a room you have been wanting to get into for the whole game.
* Replaying missions is only useful for 100% completion or finding secret boos.
* receiving calls from Professor E. Gadd every 2 seconds, especially in the beginning of the game. Seriously. It is like he is just sitting in his stupid lab doing jack crap, watching you on a tv, and commenting on your every move. ""oh wow! did you see that ghost you JUST sucked up?!""
* Gameplay might have been slightly too easy, I never died once. There were are always health pickups when you needed them.
* No more Luigi humping everything.


I will admit I have not played the multiplayer, so I have no clue what that is like.


**TLDR:** if you enjoyed the first, you will enjoy this game, but maybe not as much. If you are a newcomer and like exploring, get ready to start sucking shit up.

* You have to realistically operate a Colt 1911, a revolver or a Glock. You have to perform every operation you have to do in real life. Pulling back slides and hammers, toggling safety, ejecting magazines and casings... *everything*. You really learn how to operate a pistol. 
* Enemies are turrets and flying drones. That sounds boring, but they're some of the best enemies I've ever encountered in games. You **don't** have to deplete their huge health bars; you just have to make them non-functional. They've got motors, cameras, batteries, and all others parts such a machine would have in real life, and every part can be disabled by shooting it. Shoot the camera and it won't see you. Shoot the gun, and it will still spot you but it can't shoot you. 
* The game has a 20% discount until the 6th of May, so if you want it, you should buy it quickly. It's only 4€! 
* Maps are randomly generated so you never get bored. 
* You will die often but it isn't frustrating, because you'll always blame yourself. Enemies emit a blue light and make noises when they spot you and they won't kill you from large distances. When you die, you just ran too quickly, missed a corner or were distracted. There are no frustrating bosses or unsolvable puzzles, yet it's very hard to complete your mission (collecting all 11 tapes) because you'll probably die before you have collected 4 of them. 
* There are cheats! Type 'slomo' to enter slowmotion, and you can switch it on and off with 'tab'. It's brilliant, and really makes you feel like you're in the Matrix when you can see bullets ricocheting from walls. There are also cheats for more ammo and God mode.

It was great reviewing what fantastic work you guys had written and we really think you guys have some amazing taste in games. Anyway, on with the winners!

----

The first winner's YSB stuck out in our minds because it was really tailored to fit a recommendation for a friend. It really felt like the poster was nudging us in the right direction as if the post was a verbal discussion while eating pizza on a Friday night. And it's so in-depth that it really deserves more than 9 upvotes. So, our first winner is **/u/BBQBUDDAH22** with his [entry: **'YSB: The Binding of Isaac'!**](http://redd.it/1aojac)

&gt; *Have a few minutes before class? Waiting for in a lobby of a multiplayer game with nothing to do? The Binding of Isaac is the perfect game for those times when you want a bit of challenge and a deep game to play without committing too much time.*

A really solid example of what we do here on /r/SIBTG. Good work!

----

Our second winner is a real life saver. Why? Because when a certain big triple-A game came out recently, everyone was posting 'SIB THIS?' or 'YSB THAT!' and clogging up the subreddit. But this post not only gave a huge description of what made this game amazing but it also kept it *spoiler-free*. Personally, this was my favorite of the three winners and you guys should definitely give this a read, it's great. So, our second winner is **/u/illredditlater** with the [entry: **'WYSB Bioshock Infinite (Spoiler Free)'!**](http://redd.it/1b4kqy).

&gt; *If you hated/didn't like Bioshock 1 or 2 because of the horror elements, but enjoyed the gameplay then this game is a great alternative. Unlike the other two games, Infinite is a much brighter game and although does have its gory moments, the only times where you might feel scared is while playing in certain sections where the buildings are run down and/or don't have much electricity. The game doesn't try to scare you much more than that though.*

Really really good. Definitely prize winning and SOOOO worth a read. Check it out!

----

And lastly, our third winner is an already outstanding member of our community who made a really fantastic post on a great game. It pointed out every point that a potential buyer needs to know and really is a fantastic example of a YSB. And it's even better because it doesn't take the general ""circle jerk"" attitude and just say ""this game is amazing go buy it nowww"" but it actually says WHY and HOW it is amazing. So, our third winner is **/u/Silvanus350** with the [entry: **'YSB: Bastion'!**](http://redd.it/1amjdr).

&gt; *For those who haven't yet heard, or are still undecided, you should definitely purchase Bastion if you're looking for a new game. Bastion is a small hack n' slash RPG developed by Supergiant Games with extremely high production values. The game is dripping with style, and excels in every aspect of its implementation.*

Gathering 120 upvotes is no easy task here so definitely good job! Go check it out!

All three winners will be receiving messages from us soon and will be given one ArmA III Alpha lite key as well as a flair upgrade here on /r/ShouldIBuyThisGame so be sure to congratulate them on a job well done!

I realised why I hated WoW's last two expansions, Crapaclysm and Shit of Pandaria.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rd0-zVIBVo)

The thing that made WoW good was the motivational aspects. The idea of motivating players to actually play the fucking game so they could get to the latest content. The idea that guilds had to work their ass off to get boss kills was what people loved about the game whether semi-casual or hardcore. The entire first tier of raid bosses in Wrath fell 48 hours after the game's release (this includes the time it took for guilds to level from 70 to 80) whereas the entire first tier of raid bosses in TBC took well over a month with Magtheridon's world first taking the longest out of all the bosses.

The last two WoW expansions didn't motivate me at all. I felt no point in doing content that felt really easy but would prove to be a logistical pain in the ass - just because of the oddles of idiots that won't even turn up to scheduled raids, pump minuscule amounts of DPS, not follow simple instructions, or generally refuse to use an essential tool like DeadlyBossMods or Ventrilo - to prepare for because the amount of PvE raiders in WoW has declined massively. It's so bad now that I can't even find a LFR group on my Warrior tank these days despite being geared enough... After waiting over half an hour in queue I still cannot find a single raid member let alone the 24 others I need to actually do any LFR content.

I have now decided I wanted to quit WoW and move towards another MMORPG.

I am looking for a MMORPG that feels like vanilla/TBC WoW. Hotkey based combat system, a plethora of classes, an active community, and amazing PvE content which actually challenges the player.

Out of all the semi-recent (including recently turned F2P) MMORPGs I've tried, I have pursued the following:

* AION - Really didn't like the game. The community felt kinda dead. Then again, I played on the EU servers and that could be because a lot of players mass migrated to the NA service because Gameforge's service sucks. I quit by Level 12 and uninstalled the game. While I liked the customisation options, I kinda hated how dull playing felt.

* Lord of the Rings Online - Quit after finishing the starting zone. Felt like an inferior WoW with a fucking ugly UI. I hated it more because I tried to join the Reddit guild and basically couldn't whisper anybody because the game wouldn't let you friendlist offline people or search for people by guild name... Based on this I'm not surprised the game flopped because that is retardedly bad game design.

* Vanguard - Really disliked the game. Some of the dullest levelling content ever and the graphics looked worse than Sonic Adventure (the 2000 Dreamcast game) did... After about an hour of playing I uninstalled. Shockingly, this game came out in 2007 too...

* EverQuest II - See also. Vanguard. For some reason even on the highest settings EQ2 looked like ass and the first zone was so confusing (one such quest that was required to continue the quest line had no quest markers and asked me to go to a lake which wasn't on the zone map in any shape or form) that I uninstalled this less than thirty minutes after playing. Not even a google search got me very reliable results. It is actually the second least played game that I uninstalled, the first place prize going to From Dust.

* FlyFF - Tried this a few years ago. I was motived enough to play it to get to level 20 and unlock flying... until I realised it was nothing special and the game was linear and dull as fuck. Also, I soloed the game's content which made it even more boring.

* MapleStory - I got a Hunter to the 50s because I was motivated to see more of the world (including Aqua Road, El Nath, Leafre, Ludibrium, the Ant Tunnel etc.) Although the Big Bang update really fucked around with the levelling progression... I enjoyed it more and began to really like the game. The reason why I quit was because of how much Nexon America actually fucked the game up, through geoblocking all non-Americans (except Europeans who simply couldn't make new accounts) and through the abysmal Windows 7 support. Running the game on W7 64 bit was so painful that it led to numerous keyboard lock-ups and BSODs. Also, they went from merely running a shortcut on your desktop to run the game to having to launch it through a web browser for a stupid nonsensical reason. To me this game is truly a top tier free to play MMORPG or at least would have been if Nexon weren't so moronic.

* Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning - Never actually tried the PvE. The PvP was kinda alright but the community seemed completely dead.

* Grand Fantasia - Played because a friend wanted to get into a new game so I played with her. It felt like a duller anime-themed WoW. I have no clue how good or bad the PvE is though.

* Final Fantasy XI - Played when there was a Xbox 360 open beta. I enjoyed this game but I felt it was really hard to find groups. Plus the grind is intense.

MMOs I was thinking of giving a chance:

* Perfect World - Got put off after finding out it was given a really scathing review [by SomethingAwful's short lived MMO Roulette column.](http://www.somethingawful.com/d/mmo-roulette/buttbongo.php) I also found the idea of a sword flying mount to be really stupid.
* Forsaken World - From the same publishers as Perfect World. The intro made me think it was a pure WoW clone.
* Tibia - Really old MMO I never really looked at.
* Runes of Magic - Heard it's a pure WoW clone but one that is actually very well made.
* TERA - Recently went F2P but the 25 - 30ish GB download is really putting me off due to the bandwidth throttling of my ISP.
* Allods Online - Got put off after the whole cash store incident where they began to add debuffs on death that could only be removed or prevented through buying cash shop items. I heard they stopped that but I dunno how it rates as a MMORPG.",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,1360725472.0,,bronze,True,t3_18f41b,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/18f41b/wsib_if_i_want_a_mmorpg_with_challenging_pve/,

With the recent price cuts to Dishonored and Skyrim from $60 to $30, will either dip below $15 during the Steam Summer Sale?  And if so, is it worth buying them now for a bit more even if I'm probably not going to play them before July?

I'm liking the rebooted Lara Croft and am interested in how this game seems to be focussed on her as a character. I've never played a Tomb Raider game before (although I get this one is somewhat different), or really any game like them. I've not played the Uncharted games. Probably the closest I've played in terms of the free movement around the terrain is the Batman Arkham games, which I loved. Is this game's level exploration similar?

What's the combat like? The only cover-based shooters I've played are the Mass Effect games and a bit of Spec Ops: The Line, both on PC. I liked the combat in ME2 and especially ME3, and felt it was really well built and executed, but in Spec Ops I feel much less in control of things.

Is the this the kind of game I should play with a keyboard and mouse or with a controller (I have and Xbox 360 pad)?

So is this a game I should pick up now? Or should I wait for another sale, perhaps checking out the Uncharted series before then?

I can't decide between a Wii or a Wii U, so far I've got - 

Wii Pros:
1. Cheap
2. (Older ones) play Gamecube games. I already have a gamecube with a large library
3. A massive library of games
4. Easy to mod to play homebrew

WiiU Pros
1. A cool looking controller
2.  Future proof for 5 or 6 years (I'm guessing)
3. Plays Wii games (and thus has a large back catalogue)

Wii Cons
1.  Will likely have no more exciting releases

WiiU Cons
1. Price
2. I have no idea what the controller plays like (I haven't been able to play with one yet)
3.  Very few exclusive titles that I'm interesting in yet

Do you guys have any other opinions to throw into the mix?

We interrupt your regularly scheduled Gamer of the Week Awards with this special news. Winners of the Overall Hero award now receive a shiny trophy next to their name! Rejoice, for now you can show others even more obviously that you've accomplished something great! On a side note, remember the new rule that each user is not permitted to win any award two weeks in a row to allow other helpful users to get the recognition they deserve. Now back to your scheduled GotWs!

**YSB Legend**

This week, we had only one YSB, but it was a quality one from a user who has been here since the beginning of GotW and has constantly been putting out amazing work. In fact, he's already won the Overall Hero Award three times straight! So, for his amazing post [here about the Chronicles of Riddick](http://redd.it/109n8o), I happily award this week's YSB Legend Award to our very own /u/Skunkwourk and his elegant writing! His helpfulness has earned him now four awards. Keep on going Skunk!

This week, we had many more people comment this week, with just about the same amount of comments but from many more people. It was quite difficult to pick a single best comment because there were so many comments from so many people with so many different styles of posts that the amount of help coming in was phenomenal to see everyone being so amazing. Some awesome people started popping up like [Aidinthel](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/10a0t7/sib_the_lord_of_the_rings_war_in_the_north/c6bodt1) and [nietzkore](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/103h44/sib_civilizations_v_or_fallout_new_vegas/c6ak02j) while more experienced people like [foamed](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/109obv/wsib_stealth_games/c6bmcc1) and even past winner [shady8x](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/zy1sz/wsib_sins_of_a_solar_empire_rebellion_vs_endless/c68ujlo) made some awesome posts. But in the end, it came down to one post by one person, and this week's winner of the Comment Master Award goes to /u/pauliwrath for [his informative post about the ways of Metro 2033!](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/zxs3n/sib_metro_2033/c68pdzu).

**Overall Hero**

This was a hard week to pick a single user that stood out among the rest as our best user of the week. As I previously stated, we had a lot of new users coming in, but most of them didn't make a whole lot of posts, coming in and helping out where they fit in the best, making some extraordinary effort to help the confused gamers of Reddit which we all appreciate. But I had to do the hard job of choosing one user who best represents how amazing our subreddit is. So I thought long and hard and I decided that the winner of this week's Overall Hero Award had to be someone who was dedicated and has been for a while. And that's why it is my honor to award this week's Overall Hero Award to /u/Arturnik and his amazingly amazing posts throughout this entire week. Thank you so much Arturnik and please keep up the good work!

Audiosurf: Amazing music game which creates a 'racetrack' for any song that you own. This game is more of a time killer than anything else, but definitely worth your time.

Gemini Rue: Point and click adventure game offering two stories simultaneously, one of a detective looking for information and another of a teenager in some sort of weird facility. The game's story is actually fairly interesting, but I was not a fan of the actual game *(warning: I am terrible at point and click games so take this with a grain of salt)*.

This is my 3rd YSB in as many days. This time it's about Civilization V! ~~But wait, not *just* Civilization V, it's about Civilization V **and** the Gods &amp; Kings expansion for [just $10](http://www.getloadedgo.com/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Get+Games+Get+Loaded+23+Nov+2012&amp;utm_content=Get+Games+Get+Loaded+23+Nov+2012+CID_6e315fbcbb4e4e23d4d53753e97e09a3&amp;utm_source=cm&amp;utm_term=Click%20here%20to%20Get%20Loaded) in total for the next 2 days!~~

~~I've never actually bought from that site, but a good friend assures me that it's totally legit and he's done their deals thrice.~~

Firstly it was $15, and secondly it looks like they removed G&amp;K from the deal. Sorry 'bout that folks. No doubt it'll go on sale during the Autumn/Winter sales though. :D

So, what is Civ V? It's the newest and most radically different entry to the venerable Civilizations series of 4X alternate history games. You control one nation starting at circa 4000 B.C.E. until your glorious domination more than 6000 years later! You manage the founding of cities, the buildings inside them and what's done about the surrounding lands. You also build your army, navy, and later air force and move them around the map like it was all a giant chess game. Aside from that, you can interact with your fellow leaders in an (admittedly simplistic) game of political intrigue and finally choose what research your scientists develop. You can win the game through many different methods, a domination victory in which you crush all the opposing nations, a diplomatic victory in which you get elected to the head of the UN, a technological victory wherein you build the Apollo mission to send your astronauts into Alpha Centauri, and a cultural victory, where you overwhelm everyone with how progressive your internal affairs are.

What's different in Civ V compared to past Civ games?

* First, the map isn't square-based anymore, it's hex-based. ~~That means more degrees of freedom, and potentially more tactical battles.~~ Someone please confirm :P
* Speaking of which, no stacks of doom (!!), meaning you couldn't just roflstomp your enemies. This slows down combat a whole lot, but could make it potentially a lot funner (or more frustrating). I personally like it better than the previous games, but it isn't everyone's cup of tea.
* Culture works differently. You choose policies from a policy tree, and completing one tree adds to your cultural victory counter
* City-states which are like mini-nations with only one city who are constantly squabbling with each other. They give missions and stuff, and if you befriend them, you get bonuses like troops, money and resources. Or you could destroy them and get the stuff anyway.

Alright, now that you know that, why should you care about the expansion?

Well, to be honest, Civ V before the expansion was lackluster. The expansion mostly rectified that though. It felt like an actual expansion amidst all the ""DLC"" stuff we get these days.

The expansion adds:

* Two new nations to play as
* More types of city-states
* A religion system where you can setup your own religion and choose what bonuses it gives you and send out missionaries to cause unrest in your rivals' borders
* An espionage system where you can either destabilize the efforts of your rivals to curry favor with the city-states, or even steal tech directly from them!

It may not look like much, but, coupled with some balance changes thanks to the additions, it becomes a much better game. Especially espionage. It's a very subtle change, but the simplistic politics (and its AI) was really ramped up in the expansion. Declaring a nation-state as a protectorate actually feels like it does some good. Also, you can really damage relationships if your spies are caught, etc. etc.


And that's why I think you should buy Civilization V and its expansion. If you really liked Civ III or IV (never played I and II so I can't really tell you otherwise), you may not be comfortable with the changes in Civ V, but if you're new to the Civ series or 4X games in general, it's definitely worth a look.

If you click the 'link flair' button you can select the tag that fits your preference. Tagging your post in the title won't do anything (as of yet, not sure how ):  ). Tagging does help mods to add the tags nonetheless if you aren't able to for any reason.

Hey guys, I've added link flair to the sub. You're able to edit it yourself after you've posted a link (if not, some random mod will do it for you, you lazy ass). 

In about 50% of the posts the user doesn't specify on which platform he wants to buy a certain game. Afterwards there will be several users crying for the OP to say for what platform he wants the game.

Hope you like it, if you have any suggestions for the sub in any way (whether it is about the link flair or that silly flair I got), don't hesitate to mention it either here, or shoot me a PM if it is too personal ;).

Thanks to all the users who have been putting tags in their posts so far, and of course thanks to all users who have been contributing in this sub!

I would get this in a heartbeat, but the thing is that a month ago I was really excited to get CS:S. I mean, it was practically the only thing on my mind. I would be watching videos, tutorials, gameplay, comp gameplay, etc. 

A while afterwards, I got it. Played it a bit. Didn't really touch it after that. (FYI, only have 14 hours on it, and owned it for a few weeks or so. Played on first few days, last played it half a month ago)

TF2-items-for-Steam-games-trading-wise, CS:GO is more expensive than CS:S by a few bucks, and me being a cheap-ass, even $5 is a lot to me because of the potential profit you could make buying/selling games/items.

&gt;##TL;DR Got really excited to get CS:S, finally got it after a month, barely touched it. Don't want CS:GO to become CS:S for me.

PS: I'm not really the kinda guy who is able to continuously play the Valve official gamemodes (Arms Race/Demo/Classic Comp/etc) over and over to get better.

Some gamemodes are appealing to me at first, but usually die out for me. Yet, I've been able to play 25+ hours of TTT with GMod without getting even slightly bored.

EDIT: I've been able to play half-an-hour of Arms Race, and 2.5 hours of Demo without being bored yet. Havent tried out the Classical gamemodes because I haven't had the time yet. 

EDIT #2: Thank you all for the quick, and all-around awesome opinions. I may or may not end up activating my CS:GO in my inventory. Though if it's ever on sale for more than 33%, I'll be sure to get it :)

###EDIT #3: I decided not to buy it yet being that I did not enjoy CS:S despite being excited to get it for the month prior to getting it and that the concept of CS:GO is essentially the same as CS:S. I do hope that I will get it in the near future though, perhaps if it's on sale for more than 33% during the winter/Black Friday. I do notice notable differences (good ones) from GO compared to Source and would def. like to give it a shot, since I barely got to get enough playtime to make an opinion of GO.",,False,,t5_2ud8h,1352154304.0,,,True,t3_12mgff,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/12mgff/sib_csgo_this_time_ive_actually_tried_the_game/,

**Pros:**

* Story: The game has a great story and the story takes some pretty cool turns at points.

* Humor: Some of the best humor in an adventure game in a long time. I'm telling you it is amazing. Super funny. Stuff like breaking the 4th wall, talking about other adventure games and more.

* Character: Some amazingly fun characters that have the potential to be huge in terms of memorability. These are amazing characters, not just the main ones, but also the ones that you meet for just seconds in passing.

* Dialogue: Again going with the humor, this game has some great dialoge and some great responses to everything. 

* Voice Acting: Some spectacularly good voice acting. Fits the tone perfectly and really helps the game take on some great things.

* Art: The game is beautiful, seriously, it doesn't come across that well in the trailers as in those you only see one location or so. There are a bunch of locations in the game and they are all beautiful. 

* Music: Surprisingly well done that fits the onte of the game perfectly.

**Cons:**

* A bit buggy. Not game ruining bugs by any means, but graphical hic-ups that sometimes require you to go to the menu and re-load your last save. This isn't an issue because you can just save before you quit to menu and you lose no progress. Not sure if the bugs were caused by the game or my computer, I'm running a mid 2010 MacPro

* A bit anti-climactic. Not hugely, but the end kind of sneaks up on you quickly. 

**Mentions:**

* The game took me around 17 hours to play though. I took my time, didn't rush, but it isn't like I was just blankly staring at the screen. I predict it would take most people around 16-17 hours, maybe less but probably not too much more. 

* Puzzles aren't that hard, you won't get stuck too often, if you do, pressing space bar shows you all clickable items and you can usually find what you were missing. I tried not to use this often as I still find it fun to kind of pixel hunt a bit, but you can do it if you are short on patience and you've exhausted your options.

I am interested in BNW, however personally for me the price is a bit high right now.  According to various Steam price tracker sites the Civ V DLC and expansions usually go on sale for 75% by the Winter Sale and G&amp;K was even on sale for 85% off during the sale as well.

http://steamsales.rhekua.com/view.php?steam_type=app&amp;steam_id=16870

http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3044091

Is BNW worth the ~$15 price tag now or is it better to wait a few months until a 75% sale?  


EDIT:  On Amazon's UK site you can get a Steam key for £10 (which is approximately $15.50). The code is for both the PC and Mac version.

How is the game overall? Is the DLC worth getting along with it? How is the game on PC compared to the console versions (I have a PS3 and if the gameplay is much better on console I would wait and get it there)?

This is a sci-fi/horror visual novel/adventure game on the DS. Basically, think of it as Saw meets Phoenix Wright. There is a lot of reading but because of this the plot is very rich.

Though I say horror, its not really a scary game. You won't be having nightmares. Its just very atmospheric and slightly creepy due to the heavy tension.

A basic rundown of the plot (spoiler free): 9 people are kidnapped by a man in a Gas Mask called ""Zero"" and placed on a ship that is set to sink in nine hours. They are given numbered bracelets and told if they do not follow a set of rules, bombs that have been planted inside of them will explode. If they do not find the door with a ""9"" on it, they will sink with the boat.

There is an incredible tension in the game as they aren't sure if Zero is watching them, or if one of their fellow captors is Zero. Suspicions run high as they aren't sure who they can trust, but are forced to cooperate in order to play the game. There are mind blowing twists that will grip you from start to finish.

In order to beat the game, you must play through it at least twice, seeing two of six different endings. Not all endings are good, and I highly recommend you play through blind the first time as the chills you receive when you might get murdered by someone else is something you won't get in many other games.

The game is mostly reading, but there are also ""escape"" sections that are roughly equivalent to flash games like [this](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/215251).

Awesomenauts is a 2D 3v3 casual-ish MOBA. Right now there are 4 maps (one which was released in April), 13 'nauts you can play, and 2 more have been announced to be added. One of the announced ones was created (almost) entirely by the community in a competition. Some of the 'nauts voiced by youtubers: TotalBiscuit, Honeydew, JesseCox, and Ashley Burch from ""Hey Ash Watcha Playing"" (who's also voiced Tiny Tina) will voice the 'naut that soon will be released. 

I feel like the devs are really good. Even though they're a small indie company they've released lots of 'nauts and make balance changes (almost) each patch. Doing this makes some characters OP/UP, but that's one of my favorite things in the game, changing up builds through new patches.

In Awesomenauts all of the characters aren't available from the start, but you unlock them (takes about 4-8 hours), and after that items in the shop, by leveling outside of the matches by getting ""solar"", by either collecting it in the game or as match bonuses. This functions as EXP outside of matches, but in matches you can use it to buy things in the shop. One of the big differences from Awesomenauts compared to say LoL, is that every character have its own upgrades to buy in the shop. Before each match (after you get to level 3 or something) you can choose 3 of 6 (whereby 2 of them get unlocked by leveling) of them to have for your:

* First Ability
* Second Ability
* ""AA""
* Utility (this slot is shared by all nauts (some have small changes) and includes things like health and speed.)

This makes for 12 of 24 upgrades, which leads to a lot of builds to build. Where as in LoL you have to build Attack Damage if you're an AD Carry, or health/armor if you're a Tank, in Awesomenauts you can build a lot of different builds. Instead of leveling your abilities like in LoL you get to choose yourself what to level on them, maybe damage, silence, or lifesteal or whatever there is you want. From a quick calculation there are 241 different upgrades to buy, which adds a lot of replayability.

The thing that makes Awesomenauts so good is that it's *fun*. There are a lot of routes you can take on the maps which is just *fun*. You have to aim even your AA, so instead of having boring grinding like early in LoL the game is just *fun*.

After my 200 hours of playtime I would give it something like 92/100.

I've been wanting to play Dishonored for a really long time mow, and although I want to play Dishinored more than Skkyrim, I would still probably enjoy playing the latter. Plus, it's cheaper.

So which one should I choose? Obviously Skyrim has a huge replay value with mods and the such, but I feel as I might not particularly enjoy it because of all the complex lore and spells and open world stuff, especially since it's known for having such a huge quest line, which I usually try to complete most of it. As weird as it may sound, I'm trying not to get too pulled in by Skyrim and haven't dabbled in that specific open world RPG genre ever.

Oh boy... This came so sudden. Yesterday we were still on 9500 subscribers, but we skyrocketed all the way to 10k today! I can list many reasons why, but the most important reason why is you, the community, that form this subreddit to what it is now. Plugging all over the place and naming this subreddit to get more people out here to help you out!

Unfortunately we hit the 10k mark way too early as we (TriAft and I) had lots of things planned to bring into this subreddit. It's fairly time consuming and we have other things to do outside managing this subreddit :(. This winter's sale I will be all alone moderating this. We are looking for more moderators for this particular subreddit to help us out with doing basic stuff. Ofcourse besides being active, small things like tagging posts and managing comments (to see if posts/comments are suited for the subreddit). 

____

Below is a list of things we have planned for this subreddit so far!
----
* New flair system
* More mods
* Possible better user interface
* Possible expansion into other fields of technology
* Giveaways/contests

____

If you are interested in becoming a moderator of this subreddit you can apply by either leaving a message here, or to PM me directly for more information regarding the moderator position.

We do have some requirements for the mod position, but it won't be too strict ;)

*We will accept applications until 12/23/2012 6PM EST / 0:00AM GMT+1*

**Would be great if you could answer the following questions!**

Questions:
----
* Do you moderate any other subreddits? If yes, what are they?
* What is wrong with /r/ShouldIBuythisGame? What Would you do to improve it?
* Why do you think rule 4 in the sidebar is important? (Explain why [...] express yourself)
* What's your level of CSS skill? (If possible, Please reference any examples of your CSS work here).
* A post you see isn't following the rules in the sidebar. What do you do?
* Why should we choose you over other people applying for moderator?
* What times during the day do you browse reddit? Not much of importance, but it would be great to have a mod available during the whole day.

The amount of dedication put into each post shows the dedication to each game and the affection each person shows. Even the posts that aren't long are still helpful and each user appreciates them. So, the user this week that receives the Comment Legend Award is none other than /u/Thardus for his [extremely detailed guide on what new generation hand-held you should buy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/10clkn/sib_ps_vita_or_3ds/c6clnqp) His neutrality in the argument really is helpful because not many people can answer as WSIB thread with an in-depth post defending both sides.

Like I said, I'm an extremely casual gamer so I don't really care that much about farming the best gear or anything. I love immersion and a good community (my favorite game of all time is probably WoW) and one of the biggest issues I had with D3 was that the community seemed very fragmented/if I didn't have friends online, I would just play and grind by myself which was kind of boring.

So I just recently (and finally) picked up Fable: The Lost Chapters on my PC and I'm falling into the RPG hole again. I'm nearing the end of the game and kinda want more RPGs to play with now. Any suggestions on what I should pick up next so I can download it while I'm finishing up Fable?

RPGs that I've played:

* Mass Effect Trilogy
* Witcher 2
* Sleeping Dogs
* Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic
* Mount &amp; Blade: Warband
* The Walking Dead - more of an interactive story but still very enjoyable nonetheless
* Torchlight II
* Diablo 3
* Skyrim (I had this on my xbox 360, but don't have it on PC)
* Dragon Age: Origins &amp; Awakening
* Dragon Age 2

.. and there's probably more which I may have forgotten. I'm hoping for another RPG game in a similar vein to Fable or even M&amp;B: Warband (I've spent 130 hours playing unmodded single player on this game alone) that I can really sink my teeth into.

I was looking for some steam games to play during this time, but I'm an avid gamer and have gone through many games that I've found interesting - as a result, I seem to be in a firstworldproblem predicament... Not that I'm unhappy to be in one, but still!

I mainly made this post to see if there were games I was unaware of that would interest me; stuff like Starbound which I only recently found out about. Indie games are a plus, as they tend to have large replayability and fun gimmicks. Also they're cheap :) I picked up FTL the other week and loved it, but that only lasted for about 4 days of 5 hour sessions.

TL;DR

Looking for lasting games on Steam I may not have heard of that you enjoyed. Any genre is fine, as long as it is long lasting. Mainstream, hyped games would have probably already passed by me. (but still mention it if you feel like it!)

Both of these games seem really great and I'm sure I would enjoy either one of them. I really like the ""real time"" combat in both of them, and they both seem to have incredible scores. However, being in college definitely limits my game time so I have to choose one or the other. So, my question would be, do any of you have strong feelings one way or the other (preferably having played both games, but I realize that may not be the case). 

Pros/Cons for Ni No Kuni: I absolutely dig the art style. I'm a big anime fan and I think that the game looks beautiful, so do the slick anime style cut scenes. The Pokemon like combat system seems really interesting. Apparently the game's story is pretty emotional, which is definitely a plus. 

Pros/Cons for Xenoblade Chronicles: It will give me a reason to play my Wii again for something other than Smash Bros. Looks pretty good visually given the hardware limitations. Just seems epic, huge world size, awesome powers, big baddies to fight and what not. A Con might actually be that there is too much to do/it takes to long to beat.

Thomas was alone is an indie puzzle platformer that revolves around several different colored blocks that each can interact with the world differently.

The soundtrack and narration are both really sweet and give the game a relaxing vibe.

Keep in mind, though, the game is not long and it is not difficult.  I'm not very good at puzzle games or platformers and Steam says it took me 2 hours to beat.  To put that into some perspective, Steam says it took me the same amount of time to beat the first Portal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever I think about buying a game, the biggest question that I face is the question of value.  What is it really worth paying for?  Still sometimes a good game becomes a must buy when the price is right.  Now, it may not be the greatest game ever made but fortunately I can say with confidence that for the price of [$5.99](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/the_chronicles_of_riddick_assault_on_dark_athena) you should absolutely buy Chronicles of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena.  Here’s why…

**Background**

You’ve heard it all before.  Movie to game adaptations have always been spotty at best.   Most of the time movie properties don’t translate well into rewarding gameplay, other times developers end up deviating too much from the source material to avoid the former.  However both Escape from Butcher Bay &amp; Assault on Dark Athena are exceptions to the norm.  Both games should be played  not only because they are rare examples of games that stay true to their source material but also because they are enjoyable experience on their own.  

**Gameplay/Graphics**

Escape from Butcher Bay and Dark Athena are FPS stealth games.  However, they don’t always play like traditional FPS games and they do have some unique elements.   In Butcher Bay for example, you’re escaping from prison.  Therefore you start the game without any items and must speak to other inmates and do favors for them in order to progress.  This means a bit of stealth and a few fetch quests at first.  However  you do have the option of executing melee attacks.  In fact hand to hand combat remains in first person and is a bit more fleshed out as you can actually pull different types of punches.  Later on you can pick up weapons from slain guards and you can choose to either gun enemies down or sneak around and execute stealth melee kills. Interestingly in Dark Athena you can also grab a dead enemy's arm and use the gun grafted onto it to shoot while the lifeless body remains on the floor.  In fact you can actually “hack” certain enemies in Dark Athena and have them do your bidding remotely.  Occasionally the camera shifts to 3rd person when climbing certain objects, especially during a couple stealth sequences which also works well to remove some of the frustrations suffered when done in the first person.

Unfortunately for the PC, they are still console ports, but graphics wise the games still hold up to other modern titles though some textures are better than others.  Naturally lightning and shadows are well done since stealth is a big part of the game.  Riddick also has the ability to see in the dark, and the “night vision” is handled pretty well (again if you've seen the film, they've stayed pretty close to it).  The inferface is very minimalist with just boxes to indicate health while ammo is indicated on the guns themselves. Personally I found that the minimalist UI added a level of immersion to the game despite the 3rd person portions.

**Value**

Remember what I said about value?  Well you might have noticed that I mentioned Butcher Bay despite the title of this YSB being for Assault on Dark Athena.  Butcher Bay was originally released in 2004 to wide acclaim while Dark Athena was released in 2009.  **However, Dark Athena also included a re-mastered version of Butcher Bay**.  As a result you received 2 games for the price of one.  This brings us to the biggest selling point.  The game is currently [$5.99 on GoG](http://www.gog.com/en/gamecard/the_chronicles_of_riddick_assault_on_dark_athena) right now (lets make it $6.00).  That means you get 2 GAMES for $3.00 each.  Each game is on average  9 hours long for a total of 18 HOURS.  18 HOURS divided by $6.00 = **$.30 CENTS PER HOUR OF FUN!**  

**Conclusion**

It’s surprising to me how many people have overlooked the Riddick  games considering the similarity to later games that have received high praise.  You’ll think of **Deus Ex Human Revolution** when you drag bodies into the dark.  You’ll think of **Splinter Cell** when the screen turns a dark to indicate your stealth level.  You might think of both when you execute a stealth kill and you might even think of **Hitman** when you use an enemy as a human shield.  Add a few mech sequences, collectible cigarette packs, decent  voice acting (Vin Diesel is debatable as a good “actor” but he stays true to his movie character) decent story and you have a game that somehow successfully incorporates so many gameplay elements into one game.  

**If you want to see a successful movie to game adaptation or want to play a well made stealth FPS title, buy The Chronicles of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena.**

Passed on it when it first came out because it had to be bought, subscribed to, and had a pay shop. Now that the sub is gone, thinking of coming in and giving it a try.

How fun is it to play it as a co-op game? Could I go in with 1 friend and do most of the content? Are there quests I have to do solo? What sort of stuff is in the pay shop, and is it fair?

For context, I am a bit bored by WoW, love Ragnarok, community is a huge selling point for me in games.",[PC],False,,t5_2ud8h,False,,,True,t3_1ifs3s,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShouldIbuythisgame/comments/1ifs3s/sib_the_secret_world/,
