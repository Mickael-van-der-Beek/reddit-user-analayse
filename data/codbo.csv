1291000783.0,404,self.codbo,ed4gs,Why I am AWESOME at Call of Duty: Black Ops,checkmarshall,478,74,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/ed4gs/why_i_am_awesome_at_call_of_duty_black_ops/,"1. If you need legs or feet shot to shit, Im your man! I will seriously fuck up some lower appendages. Though, they will most likely kill me.. my target will never walk again. Fuck yeah. 

2. They might as well have a class specifically for me called ""Special Insurgent"" because I spawn right where all the other players seem to be in the middle of killing my teammates. I usually shoot enough bullets at their feet that they notice me right away though.

3.  I have magic bullets. No, not the kind that bend around corners for head shots, but the kind that ricochet off of clothes. Seriously... I can unload a clip into a targets skull and that nice bandana on their head? Hardly a scratch... more like a tap on the shoulder ""Hey friend, I know you just killed my teammate, but now your bullets can head my way!""

4. Dogs fucking love me. I will be around 2 or 3 of my teammates... but when dogs are around... its like they don't even exists. Those bitches love to jump up and fuck my face until I die.  

5.  I constantly throw my body in front of my teammates to save their lives. Even when the shooter doesn't see me, I make sure to run right towards them shooting their balls (which also deflect bullets).

6.  Im like the mother fucking bomb squad in this game. Plant a claymore and I will hunt that bitch down and chuck my goofy ass on that bitch. I dont care if you plant that son of a bitch in the back corner of the map. Call me mine sweeper. 

7. Need one more kill for your kill streak? Dont worry Ill weaken someone up just so you can get the final shot and claim the kill. Its cool... Ill be dead already anyway. It must be fucking sweet shooting people from that chopper. 

8. Pretend to be dead by going prone, Ill run right by your obvious living ass and try to stab the wall. Walls and trees aint got shit on me and my fucking knife. 

9.  Who needs radar? I run around for minutes at a time not getting killed by ANYONE! Who the fuck cares that the battle is happening on the other side of the map? Im hanging out in this mother fucking tree house getting my camp on... someone is bound to run by this window. 

10.  Bet you didnt know you could drown in this game? Fuck yeah you can.. I did and Im awesome.

A lot of you know me from /r/MW2 where I was pretty active and a lot of you are new to me. I mainly sit in the shadows and try to make sure that new posts on this subreddit get the recognition they deserve. I've been a mod since philkav asked if anyone was interested and he was nice enough to let me into the club. I'm not a coder and have almost no computer knowledge, but I try to do my part and leave that to the guys who know what they're doing.

Recently we installed a new tagging system here on /r/codbo that Got_Milk graciously offered to us. He's put hours of work into it for not just himself, but our little subreddit as well. Because of his hard work, he was made a mod. He wasn't a mod to start with and he didn't ask to be one. He was made one and was very appreciative when we added him. 

Now, he's resigning as a mod. Why? Is it because he's a college student and needs the extra time to focus on his studies? No. It's because people submit their information to the tagging system, go make a test post, see it isn't showing up yet and send him threatening and childish PMs. 

&gt; Note that the changes aren't instant

This quote is from the tagging system post made a month ago. I'm guessing the people who sent these messages either didn't do a search to see if anything had been posted about the tagging system or didn't comprehend that the tagging system, is in fact, not instant. 

Guys, we lost a great guy and a great Mod because of childish behavior. I came here ready to start a flame war because I've been playing COD with Got_Milk since I joined /r/MW2 and I consider him a friend. 

But seriously, for the sake of this community, grow up. Someone nominated us for best small community. Do you guys actually think that we deserve that when we have moderators resigning because people are sending him threatening PMs about a fucking tagging system? 

I don't speak for all the Mods. I speak for myself. They can feel free to chime if they want to, or hell, if this is so inflamitory, remove me as a Mod. I don't care.

http://www.gamexe.net/codbo/playercard/

Alright everyone! Thanks for all the patience. Been hard at work on this, and I think it's paid off. I think, I hope, that everything is stable now. I'll continue to tweek and optimize things over the next few days anyhow, just to improve performance a bit more. I apologize for any slowness you might encounter over the next couple days.

And once again, if anyone has any suggestions, or you notice a bug, please let me know in the comments.

&gt;ORIGINAL MESSAGE:
&gt;
&gt;http://www.gamexe.net/codbo/playercard/?id=2
&gt;Cause it was getting to be a pain taking pictures of my monitor to show my friends my emblems.
&gt;
&gt;And here's the link to the default editor, without my emblem loaded up:

&gt;
&gt;Alright, sorry everyone! I'm trying my best to improve things right now, but it looks like I'm gonna have to sit it &gt;out t'ill tomorrow to see what my host can do to help. Traffic is pretty high, but I'm not sure if that's the only &gt;factor. If you manage to catch it online to see what it's like in the meantime, hope you like it. If you aren't &gt;able to see it in the works, you can check out the screenshot above to see what it looked like - and then take &gt;my word that it actually works.
&gt;
&gt;EDIT 2: I'm done for tonight. Will keep troubleshooting tomorrow, and hopefully have this figured out after &gt;class. Revamped the httpd.conf file and cut a few hundred kb's from the page - should allow some more traffic &gt;through.
&gt;
&gt;Edit 3 (1st Dec): The site should be able to handle all the traffic by midnight tonight: Just gotta wait for a &gt;DNS change to propagate.

I'm nearing 50 years of age and don't have the reflexes of a youngling anymore, but I am seldom an embarrassment to the team I play on. I first started playing video games on something called ""pong"" before advancing to Questron on the C64, my first computer.

While playing Black Ops, this past two weeks, I have never won a free-for-all, but have placed in the top three a few times. Usually I get between 5-15 kills. On team deathmatch, probably the same score.

I'll never be as good as some, but I know I am better than others and am improving as I learn the maps. I got tired of playing Halo Reach and Halo 3, but the muscle memory of the weapons layout still remains. I feel sorry for those players who get beaten by ""the old guy"" as they must really be bad.

It's a great stress relief after work to play Black Ops and recommend it to others my age, but I don't know any my age so I don't. I prop two pillows against the foot stool in the middle of the living room floor, the dog jumps on my chest and falls asleep, the 52-inch flatscreen comes to life and for an hour or so, before fixing supper, I kill and crack wise.

edit: checked this morning and my KtD ratio is .74 which is up from .23 from a week ago. Was going to play last night but had an online poker tourney which I wanted to win...yes I did win it!

The Plan
--------

Several of these perks are great to pro together.

**Combo 1:** Flak Jacket / Steady Aim / Ninja

* Steady Aim and/or Sleight of Hand should be pro-ed as soon as possible. They are probably the most versatile perks for all class-types. Just play the game and you will usually complete the challenges naturally. If and when you come to the final challenge of SoH, play **domination** and when someone is capping a flag, shoot them once around a corner, hide and reload, and then finish them off. This might be easier to do in demolition, but I don't want to suggest potentially letting them plant the bomb.

* FJ and Ninja are perfect combos in that they both share the same challenge: plant 10 (15 in FJ's case) bombs. You can usually do this in 3-4 games depending on how aggressive you are.

* Just make sure your gun is silenced (depending on your level, Famas/Spas/AK-47 are all good choices), and keep your knife at the ready (don't use tactical layout), and you should be able to naturally complete all but the grenade throwback challenges.

* For the grenade throwbacks, the general advice is to go to Firing Range's crow nest and just wait it out. I prefer to just play a lot of domination and be *very* ready to throw them back while capping a flag (usually B).

**Combo 2:** Scavenger / Warlord / Tactical Mask

* Another great combo for pro-ing these three perks. Scavenger and Warlord both place a lot of emphasis on grenade kills, and once you pro Scavenger (and Warlord), Tac Mask becomes a lot easier after the supply of tactical grenades becomes virtually endless.

* Scavenger is largely pro-ed naturally, except for the scavenged grenade kills. I got lucky and got a four-kill stick with a scavenged grenade, but you can more intentionally accomplish this by always ""scouting"" with your starting grenade, so that any grenade you have while playing is scavenged. Play domination, and learn those nade throws. I prefer semtex, but only because I have become comfortable with how far I must be from a flag to nade it (as well as not having to cook the grenade)

* Once you Scav/Warlord pro-ed, just keep tossing those tac grenades around corners. You will rarely run out for too long, and except for nova gas, you will complete these pretty quickly (especially in Nuke Town).

**Combo 3:** Hardline / Sleight of Hand / Second Chance

* Not as compatible a combo as the previous two, but Second Chance can help when getting those kill streaks (especially when you are one kill short of a care package or the ""seven kill streak"" challenge).

* Also, the hardest challenge of sleight of hand is injuring someone, reloading, and killing them. If you are killed while reloading, you can often complete this challenge by finishing them off in 2nd chance. I know this perk is frowned upon here, so just don't tell anyone;)

* For sharing packages, any package works. Set your kill streaks to SAM turret / Care Package / Sentry Gun. Save them up as you get them. Once a teammate uses a counter spy place, place them all in your team's spawn (best to do this during objective games when spawns are more set). I finished hardline pro in 4 games. 2nd chance is really easy to do as well. SoH, at least, doesn't require you to radically change your play style.

**Combo 4:** Lightweight / Scout / Marathon

* All of this should be playing CTF. Never stop running.

* Secondary should be ballistic knife. Use Steady Aim instead of Scout until you get the 2 kills in 5 seconds. Then switch to Scout and start getting secondary kills.

* Once you have gotten your knife kills for lightweight, switch to a pistol for secondary. Primary should be any sniper rifle. When playing defense, set yourself up on the plane the enemy will run on to go back to their base. Use a jammer to hide your position, though in my experience flag runners just run and pray. This will make hitting the upper body easier as they are running away from you instead of across.

* If you miss them, change to secondary and chase.

* The lightweight/marathon challenges are relatively self explanatory. For first blood, just start practicing those nade tosses, and play demolition/search &amp; destory (more rounds = more chances to get first blood)

**Combo 5:** Ghost / Hardened / Hacker

* I save ghost for last, only because you really want to wait until level 30 before pro-ing ghost. The difference between using a Strela and the M2 Law is pretty significant, unless you have Scavenger.

* Hacker will help ghost locate the sentry gun, though honestly this challenge will almost always be finished before the others, and without really trying. Just remember to tac grenade the sentry gun first.

* Hacker will also help you complete your hardened equipment challenge, but like the sentry gun, it's too easy to really give advice for.

* If you pro ghost before hardened, it is really easy to get the aircraft shots since the aircraft won't fire back. If not, you can usually get 30-40 bullets with an auto-rifle if you are positioned well enough.

* Using a motion sensor, it is easier to kill people through walls, but I found that you get this challenge pretty easily without trying.

* For hacker, use decoys to lure people into your equipment. I find that claymores are the more natural of the two explosives, but C4 can be completed faster with smart placement. Use whichever you prefer, but if you want to ""think less,"" just go for claymore, and make sure you always have one planted each time you spawn.

Advice from posters
-------------------

**downwithlevers**

* To get 5 throwbacks for **FJ Pro**, hang around the bomb in Demolition like you're attached to it with a 3 foot leash. Plant, defuse, camp, whatever. Your KDR will go to shit while you're doing it (if you care) but you'll get those throwbacks quicker than the crow's nest in my experience at least.

* To get those first bloods quick for **marathon**, play Domination. Rather than capturing A immediately for that quick 150, run straight to B every time. You'll get first bloods if you're quick. This works better for me than praying the random grenade gets a kill at the beginning. My best first blood experience on Domination is on the Jungle map. If you spawn on the ""shantytown"" side instead of the ""douchebag hill"" side (sorry I forget the flag letters), you can easily run down the hill and to the right towards B, sit behind the red barrels, and kill dudes coming down the hill directly ahead. Works 99% of the time.

* If you're having trouble getting the multi-kill for **Warlord Pro**, tossing a grenade in the upstairs windows of Nuketown often works. Other than that, throw 'em at the bomb in Demolition.

* Here's a tip for **Tac Mask Pro** that took me forever to realize on my own. You don't have to kill the guy with your nova gas directly. He just has to be affected by your nova gas and then die. So toss some gas at the enemy and once you get that gas hit marker, blow him away with your gun.

* For **Hardline Pro**, I've found that a lot of times if I ask my team of randoms to grab a crate and help a brother out, they ignore the crate just to be d-bags unless it's dogs or something amazing. So play with friends and have a system worked out. Let them know when and where you're tossing your care package marker and ask them nicely to do you a solid.

**kungpu**

* Easiest way to get the **backstabber** is to camp near the the bomb in demo (Ghost helps) and wait until someone comes to plant. Once you hear the buttons you jump out and pull a sneak attack from behind, it works like a charm. I had a round on Havana where I went prone on the bomb in the back alley, just behind that small staircase, I must have knifed at least 6-7 players in the backtrying to plant that bomb.

**ripthatbong**

* I found getting the **Offense Medals with Lightweight** easy in CTF as well, just pick up the flag and kill people while you're carrying it. 10 kills and you're done.

**JPsmooth42**

* If you are going for **Tac Mask Pro**, remember that your teammates tactical grenades will count toward the challenge. So buy Nova Gas first (obviously the hardest one to get) and if you are running with a smart team that uses their tactical grenades you will get the Flash/concussion kills finished without even equipping them.

Step One: Get to Lvl 50 and by now you should have quite a lot of money

Step Two: Do some warm-up matches in the Wager Matches lobbies. I prefer doing Gun Game matches in the ""Ante Up"" and then ""Weekend Gambler"" lobbies because it really seems like the only Wager Match where you can be consistent IMO.

Step Three: Once you have a good feel for the rotation of games and have won a couple of games find a ""High Roller"" lobby of Gun Game.

Step Four: When the map is locked make sure you ""Double Down"" first (just in case people Double Down) and then hit the Prestige button.

Step Five: Wreck Shit in the game

Step Six: Profit

Really you don't have to win to make a lot of money, even 2nd or 3rd place will net you some big bucks. Even if you don't make any money it's not like you lose anything so it's only a positive experience. So good luck and fun making some money!

TL;DR:   Prestige in Wager Match Lobby to start off with a lot of money in case you win.

IMO, I think it would be a lot more fun if 3arc set a level cap (with maybe a final boss or something?).  For replayability, players could compete for the fastest completion time rather than highest level reached.  Another positive benefit of this is that I think it would make zombies less campy and more fast-paced run n gun (since you're trying to go for a fast completion time).

After spending a lot of time trying to figure out why, this is my opinion as to why, explained in a lovely multi-step process

1. Let's face it, the majority of players in Call of Duty today probably started playing at MW2. When these players started playing, they were bad at the game. Some of them eventually got good, but by being bad, their stats (read: K/D) had gone beyond salvageable, and it was impossible to bring back up.

2. Players that had been in CoD before MW2 were introduced to an epic error/shitstorm of a game. Good players found themselves decidedly average in the face of OMA tubing and Commando. Their ability to have good games likely took a dip as well. Anyways,both points 1 &amp; 2 lead us to point 3:

3. Black Ops comes out! No more shitstorm! I can have a good K/D again! Scream the old players from before MW2. Now I too can have a good K/D, scream the MW2 inductees. The problem was, that for most players, the safest way to get good games is to camp. Therefore, people camp in corners and get good gameplays. Sure, their K/Ds go up, but they feel unfulfilled

4. Black Ops becomes trite to these players. Same camp spots, same corners, day in, day out. Campers get bored even though they are good. The sheer amount of camping turns Black Ops into a totally defensive game overall. People who don't play defensively hate the game because they keep getting killed by the same campers in the same camp spots. Variety and Fun get flushed down the toilet.

5. People are afraid to leave their comfort zone, even though their comfort zone is driving their boredom with the game. If more people tried new guns and rushed more, we'd have less problems. But of course, people are afraid to leave their comfort zone.

Of course, this problem will never be resolved because you can't patch people. But, you can try to put a smaller emphasis on your own K/D and instead try working on your K/D by gun or your W/L.

1298700789.0,78,self.codbo,ft1yd,How to be a better teammate. Please add your knowledge!,ViralRiot,83,5,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/ft1yd/how_to_be_a_better_teammate_please_add_your/,"Alright everyone, this guide is for veterans and newbies alike. If you're tired of losing or just don't know how to communicate teamwork to your team, then please read on. I will try my best to list pointers for the gametypes I play the most. If you read this and feel like I missed something or wish to add to it, please feel free to post your opinions and I'll add them to this guide. That being said, here we go:

**GENERAL**

* Be mindful of doorways or small entrances. You can unknowingly be blocking a teammate trying to cut off an enemy you're unaware of, get to an objective, or trying to RUN AWAY.


* If you're using Second Chance Pro, please know that you're going to get your teammate killed if you continue to lay there in the open. Move yourself to proper cover so a teammate can safely revive you.


* Is your teammate prone or sniping or BOTH? You probably shouldn't stand in front of them or around them firing your weapon like it's a damn middle eastern wedding.


* Notice a teammate using Ghost? If you can help it, don't shadow the guy. If a Spy Plane goes up and you're not using Ghost, then you're pretty much negating your teammate's perk.


* When I'm playing with randoms, even if I know they don't have mics, I still shout out ""We need B"" or ""Someone cover A"" and it generally works out because they can still hear you. So even if you are the only one on the team with a mic you can still attempt to notify and command your teammates.


* Don't change other people's care package unless they ask you to.


* If a teammate drops a care package, DON'T TAKE THEIR CARE PACKAGE.. unless they say so or they die and you know people are coming for it. Better my teammate have the killstreak than the enemy.




**DOMINATION**


A lot of the times I play DOM, I'm always wondering what my team is doing. I find myself trying to capture things by myself or with some other guy that isn't covering correctly. Here is how you can be a good teammate on DOM:


* When capturing a point that has more than one way of attack, notice which direction your teammate is looking in. It doesn't do anyone any good if you're both looking in the same direction.


* Going prone isn't always the best option when capturing. It's important that you're able to move in case of an incoming semtex/frag/gas grenade. Also, you'll want to have the best line of sight from where the enemy will be attacking from. LAUNCH DOM Flag B is a perfect example. So many times I see people capping that flag and they're dug in between the two blast doors proned out. That makes it easy for me to nail you with an explosive. Rather, you should be standing up and aiming uphill. Nine times out of ten, you will catch them sprinting down the hill and you get an easy kill.


* Flak Jacket Pro is essential to Domination. Let people complain about Ghost all they want, but Flak Jacket Pro is invaluable when playing Domination. Most people like to use Napalm Strike for DOM and if you have Pro, it won't affect you. This also allows you to use Tactical Mask for the 3rd Tier. You no longer need Hacker since claymores won't hurt you much, and let's face it, Claymores are the only reason you use Hacker anyway. Now you can capture flags with ease. Desperation nades won't kill you and now you can't get gassed or flashed.


* Use your mini map!! I can't stress this enough. If you find that you have the majority of the flags, hang back until you can coordinate a 3-CAP. Look at where your team is and post up where they aren't. It doesn't do any good to concentrate forces on one side of the map. It only takes one enemy to leak through and now your entire line is falling back to defend a flag. On that same token, if you find that you only have one flag or worse, look at where your team is and get there quick. Capturing points is quick and easy with 2+ people on the flag.


* Don't just stand there, capture that point! I know a lot of you mean well enough when you hang back and provide cover for somebody, but that tactic has a time and place. In close quarters, it's A LOT more helpful to your team to get on that point! You capture it faster, and if the enemy picks off you or your teammate, you or your teammate is still there to finish the cap.


* Remember that time and place I was talking about? Here it is. In wide open points like Flag B on WMD, it's a lot better to throw smoke on that point for your teammate and provide covering fire from either the broken wall, the HVAC ledge, or the sandbags. Coming from C, you should provide cover from the L-Catwalk or the red warehouse. If you don't have smoke, then get on the point with your teammate. DO NOT throw smoke down in close quarters points. It makes it impossible to kill incoming defenders. Remember, all they have to do is run in guns blazing. So many times I see people throw down smoke on Firing Range. This is just stupid. It doesn't help.


* COMMUNICATE. Seriously you'd think this is common sense, but most of the time I find people don't talk unless somebody talks to them first. When providing details to enemy positions, it's important to remember that a lot of players don't know the map location slang. I'm not saying don't use it, I'm only saying that you may need to be more specific.


* Keep an eye flag markers. Sometimes the game won't announce the flags are being taken and it's easy to miss when you're focusing on defending a point. If you're dug in pretty well on a certain point, let your teammates know that a flag is being taken.


* Killstreaks! It's been repeated on this board time and again, but it's the most important thing to remember. SPY PLANES WIN GAMES. I know everyone likes to get into the Chopper Gunner or Gunship or release the hounds, but honestly those aren't entirely useful when it comes to DOM. Spy Plane, Sentry Gun, Mortars, Napalm Strike, and Black Bird are the killstreaks you're gonna want to look into. Having just one of those is helpful enough.



**DEMOLITION**


A lot of what I mentioned in my DOMINATION section is also applicable here. There are a few additions however.


* For God's sake cover the bomb planter/defuser. So many times I've been defusing the bomb and a teammate comes and prones out right next to me with his face shoved into the bomb site. If you see a teammate defusing/planting, START THROWIN YOUR TACTICALS! You want to slow that enemy down, and nothing slows them down more than a cloud of gas or huge white screen. If you get no hitmarkers, stay with your teammate and cover him as best you can. If you see hitmarkers, it's time to throw that LETHAL. After that, sight in and start prefiring those doors/corners/etc. You want the attention on YOU, NOT your teammate.


* Once the bomb is planted or defused, it's time to protect it. Set a claymore down if you want. After that, GET OUT OF THERE. The enemy is going to be throwing Tacticals and Lethals in there like it's going out of style. You want to kill them before they get a chance. Post up on corners around the bomb site. Havana is a good example of how this works. While defending the indoor bomb site, it's good to have one man on the balcony, one man on the stairs in the ally way, one man outside near the double doors leading into the bombsite, one man on the fountain near the outdoor bomb site, and the rest can do whatever. Those four points NEED to be covered. Having one man on the opposite balcony near the outdoor bomb site is also good, especially if you still have that bomb site up.


* Save your killstreaks if the round is about to end. I have honestly seen a teammate throw a Chopper Gunner or Black Bird up right before the round ends. Save those killstreaks for the next round.


* Chopper Gunner is AMAZING for Demolition. You can practically ensure a victory for your team if you save a Chopper Gunner until your team plants both bombs. Throw it up and it's in the bag. If you're defending, then it doesn't entirely matter when you use it, but it's generally a good idea to let'a'rip when you suffer a plant.


* Napalm Strike is also a valuable killstreak. You're not going to want to lay it down on the bomb site however. You want to make a line that the enemy can't pass. Make them take another route. Even better, make them take a detour right into your teammates' crossfire.


* Gas those choke points! I just got my ass handed to me by a well coordinated team on Discovery because they planted catwalk bomb site and just chucked gas at that bridge. My team got bogged down and that was just more precious seconds wasted. If you're not a fan of gas, then other tacticals work as well. Whatever it takes to slow down your enemy.


* Noob Tubing goes a long way. By no means should you spam your M203. They are precious and should only be used if you see an enemy about to plant/defuse and they are hiding behind the bomb site.


* Flak Jacket and Tactical Mask are also recommended for this gametype. You make yourself a lot harder to kill that way and it has saved me tons of times while I am defusing or planting.




**CAPTURE THE FLAG**


* When playing CTF and your team has got the flag, there is no use in having 5 guys surrounding the building their flag carrier is hiding inside. SOMEONE NEEDS TO RECOVER THAT DAMN FLAG!!! Especially when the enemy has spy planes up and half the team is running lightweight...


Also, keeping the enemy flag and killing enemies incoming is only going to work if you know how to use your gun....


Side note: A good way to rank up lightweight to pro is to hold the enemy flag and get kills. Offense medals every time.


Well, those are the three main game types that I play, so I won't try to preach about others. If you have something to add, or correct, please let me know.

Nuketown is small but it's so simple in layout that you can almost turn your brain off and just have some mindless fun racking up kills. Sure it doesn't encourage strategy, and methodical players are probably turned off by the run-and-gun nature, but it's only one map in a set and I find it a welcome diversion from larger maps with a lot of buildings and crevices.

Thank you. Thanks for being there for me when PSN wasn't. Thank you Recruit level comps for being so incredibly incompetent allowing me to blow off steam by going 75-2 with only the balistic knife and the tomahawk. Thank you Hardened Comps, for being so unbelievably good that you can whip around a corner at a full run with your sights automatically sighted in on my head, killing me in 3 shots from across the map with your SILENCED MP5!.  This allowed me to relive the vein-popping rage so often experienced on PSN. Thank you dogs, for being obtainable in the split-screen local play. Also, I had never used the chopper gunner before, now I know what it feels like. Thank you!  

Thank you split-screen play, for allowing me access to every unlocked pro-perk. Marathon Pro has been so fun! I'm pretty sure capping a flag is impossible for me on PSN since it requires actual team play, which we both know is unnatainable for me since I have no friends.  

Thats not to say that there isn't room for improvement. Not once, in the 2 weeks I've been playing have you ever called me a ""dick licking jew-fag camper!"" - or rage quit on me at 7300-2300 in TDM telling me to go ""fuck a goat you aids infected anal discharge"". If you could incorporate these into the gameplay, I'd appreciate it, it would make the experience much more PSN-like.  

In summary, I appreciate you Computer Players, you've been good friends. I'm sorry about setting you to Recruit and making you play Nuketown for 8 hours straight that one time. It was a rough day, and I needed SOMETHING. I'll see you tonight at 5ish. We'll play Summit this time, and maybe I'll set you to ""Veteran"" - Unless you start beating me, then I'll rage quit and set you back to ""Recruit"" - Bitch.

[**Sound**](http://imgur.com/yxnsS)  
Whether you like it or not sound plays a huge factor into how well you can perform during matches. Being able to hear which direction enemies are coming from or shooting you from makes all the difference in the world. If you have a nice surround sound system in your gaming area, crank it up. However if your like most of us you're not rocking a 5.1/7.1 system. This is where surround sound headsets come into play. Surround sound makes all the difference, However even a stereo headset can improve your game.  
  
  
  
[**Controller**](http://imgur.com/ggWro)  
[Kontrol Freek](http://www.kontrolfreek.com/) thumb stick Mods are a $10 investment which can significantly improve your Aiming accuracy as well as place your thumbs in a more ergonomically/comfortable position. It takes a day or two to get used to the change, but once you have you realize how little of an aiming radius the standard 360 controller offers you'll find them to be worth every dollar. Wired &gt; Wireless, Simple concept, you don't want to be caught with a low battery in the middle of a gun fight. Don't eat greasy foods or Cheetos while playing, especially if you're using my controller.  
   
   

   
**HUD/Safe Area**  
In the options menu you run across an option known as [**Safe Area**](http://imgur.com/RHw0G). Safe area effects the the positioning of your radar, score board, ammo count and kill feed. 
   
* [**Max Safe Area**](http://imgur.com/TOpTV) = [**Further**](http://imgur.com/3gJgp) from the center 
* [**Min Safe Area**](http://imgur.com/2Mc93) = [**Closer**](http://imgur.com/mfyKgl) to the center  
  
Now for smaller TV/Monitors (Under 24'') this might not make a difference, but for anything larger you generally want to decrease the area of the safe zone. Doing this will Bring the Radar closer to your peripheral vision, Decreasing the distance your eyes have to travel to see the map and return to your center field of view.  
  
   
**Look Sensitivity**  
An obvious adjustment. If you haven't experimented with your look sensitivity you may be heavily hindering your abilities while playing. An average sensitivity falls in the range of 4-5. Enter a combat training match with easy bots. Start at high sensitivity like 6 . Run around and gather up kills. Even if this seems really fast you want to try it out for a good 5 minutes. From there adjust either lower or higher. Higher sensitivities take some time to get used to but can have big pay offs if you can get use to them. If you're pigeon-holed at a lower sensitivity try increasing it by 1 and play for a night, you might be surprised how quickly you can adjust yourself to it.  
   
  
  
[**TV Distance**](http://imgur.com/NObWm)    
Depending on how good your eyes are or aren't you might want to adjust how far or close you sit to the TV. I use a 32'' TV and sit about 7ft away from it in a computer chair. If you are gaming in a living room instead of sitting on the couch, pull your computer chair out to the living room and experiment with different distances. You want to sit close enough to take in all the surroundings on the TV but not so close that you have to physically move your head to see different areas of the screen. 
  
  
  
**Hand/Arm Positioning**  
This one might be a little weird to explain. When I play, usually in a computer chair, I rest my elbows on the top of my thighs/knee area with the controller sitting about halfway up between my head and thighs. Taking the stress off of holding your arms up while you play can improve reaction time with your thumbs. It's weird so I'll just leave it at that.

Well in all the videos I've seen of BO when you his start the overhead map is overlaid with a coordinates grid. Such a small but cool thing to do. Now you can just say ""sniper at B3"" instead of ""guy by the bushes near one of those vans on that one side.....""

1292459620.0,61,self.codbo,emiwl,"[How-To] NAT, Black Ops, and You! (All platforms)",got_milk4,65,4,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/emiwl/howto_nat_black_ops_and_you_all_platforms/,"I expected questions to quickly appear after the new NAT status indicator in the update and I thought I'd beat the rush (but apparently I'm still too late).

**What is NAT?**

NAT (acronym for Network Address Translation) is a methodology employed by your router to translate requests from the internet and route them to the appropriate device.

Most of you should at least have heard the term IP address - it's the unique address provided to each device connected to the internet. IP addresses range from 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255 (why 255.255.255.255? Because the current IP protocol uses 32-bit addressing, so 255.255.255.255 is the highest 32-bit address available). These available addresses are then broken down into blocks, some reserved for specific usage (for example, 192.168.x.x is reserved for private networking), others reserved for various reasons which are irrelevant here.

But there's a catch - after allocation, we're left with only ~3.5 billion addresses available. We all know there's more than 3.5 billion devices in the world, and each device needs its own IP, so how did we work around this?

Meet NAT. In the internet world, you have ONE IP address provided by your ISP, and that's what everyone will use to connect and communicate with you. In your internal network, every consumer router assigns a private IP address in the 192.168.x.x range to each device connected to it. When outgoing connections are made, the router makes a note in the NAT table which device sent the request and to where. When the response is received, the router uses the NAT table to determine who it should be routed to. Ta-da!

**Why does NAT affect my Black Ops gameplay?**

Sometimes, however, when you join a lobby or a game and others join around you, you may receive packets before you send a request. If a router receives a packet of data and it doesn't correspond with an entry in the NAT table, the router will not know what to do with the packet of data and simply 'drop' it, never making it to its intended destination. If these sorts of issues occur, then it may become impossible to join in certain parties, play in certain games or even join games with a specific person.

**My NAT is Closed/Moderate! What do I do?**

You'll need to log into your router and setup **Port Forwarding**. A list of ports you need to open are below:

**Xbox 360:**

* TCP Ports: 53, 80, 3074
* UDP Ports: 53, 88 3074

**PlayStation 3:**

* TCP Ports: 80, 81, 443, 3074, 5223
* UDP Ports: 3074, 3075, 3478

**Windows PC:**

* TCP Ports: 3074
* UDP Ports: 3074

Unfortunately since there are many different routers I can't outline a step by step process to setup port forwarding as everyone's will be different. Check the documentation that came with your router or your router manufacturer's website - it will have the step by step instructions you'll need.

That's it! Enjoy your less-lag faster-joining Black Ops gameplay.

**Wait! What if this doesn't work for me?**

1. Know the difference between camping as opposed to holding down an area. Camping, *will* get you killed and make your teammates hate you, if you somehow don't die you're consequently fucking your teammates because you're giving them the same shit spawn, over and over. Holding down an area is more or less running a circle around a hot spot. Watching XboxAhoy videos really helps clarify this, but for example, the area on Havana with the bar is a great perimeter to hold down.


2. If one dude keeps killing you, fucking ignore him. (One of the hardest lessons for me to learn) Because unfortunately he'll probably keep fucking killing you until there's a controller shaped hole in your T.V. Campers thrive on players who have a revenge type of game play, just sayin.


3. Fucking talk, even if no one on your team has a mic, fucking talk. Usually people will have audio through the speakers so even without mics they can be coordinated to an extent. And of course opposite to this, if you don't have a mic, you'd want a guy calling shit out. But, if you do have the privilege of mic and even better, so do your mates, make *sure* you're communicating and take advantage of this. It is absolutely essential, especially if you get some decent opponents.


4. Since we're on the subject of mics. Sometimes I wonder if people on Xbox Live understand what exactly a mic is, and often they will display this lack of knowledge by blaring either static/bad music/background chatter/etc... Do yourself a favor, make friends with the mute button. You'd be surprised how much that 10 year old yelling about black people can disrupt your game, just mute him, and for damn sure, don't engage him (at least not in argument). You can mute individual players in game by checking the scoreboard, using the d-pad to get to their name and pressing X. Out of game muting is more of a self-explanatory process.


5. Classes. Make them congruent, make your perks/gun/equipment /killstreaks all flow into one force of destruction. For example, a ""congruent"" class as it were would be Scavenger/Warlord/Tac Mask, all three compliment the other making your character overall advantageous. Of course the obvious one, Ghost/Scout/Ninja with a suppressor/motion sensor makes a shit load of sense. In essence, a poor loadout is one where the complimenting of equipment/classes/perks is absent.


6. If you're opposed to my #1 and consider ""holding down an area"" just as campy as simply sitting there, I have a solution. Run circles around the maps perimeter and avoid the middle of the map where the hot spots are. This allows you to both constantly know where their spawn is while simoutaneously catching campers on the outskirts of the maps. This will get you some deaths but the amount of kills should be considerable enough to be your payoff.


The last rule, #7 deals with a one on one shootout, and there are two main rules that took me a while to really grasp. First, if you encounter your opponent and barely dodge into cover, do not come back out 1 second later, you *will* die. The superior option, imo, is to try to get behind them, jump through a window or w/e, do what you gotta do. But odds are, in a reflex battle  against these 11 year olds, all hopped up on mountain dew you're gonna get sprayed to shit before you've even aimed up, so out smart the little bastards, get savvy. 

The second rule(s) of one on one fights. First of all, THIS IS NOT HALO, jumping is not going to help you. And, unfortunately, strafing will seldom save you, but if you do strafe avoid the obvious direction. If you see someone while running right, don't keep running right while engaging, rather, as soon as you start the engagement dip left, good chance he'll freak out and spray. But the overall best tactic in one on one fights comes down to the % of body shown (i.e. head glitch). Your best bet in any one on one engagements is to either A)Get behind glitchy cover (which is not hard to do/find) or B)*GET LOW*, mother fucking LAY DOWN. This is the biggest thing for me in almost every engagement, but it took me so long, to both remember to do it as well as master it. Warning though, laying down at the wrong time can also get you killed, so timing your laydowns right takes a little practice.


But yeah that's all I can think of right now. Hope I helped some newbies, like we all once were.


Killed a solid hour at work w00t!

*TL;DR* 

*Hold down area but don't camp

*Ignore the camper

*Communicate as much as you can, whatever way you can.

*Make friends with the mute button.

*Make classes congruent, logical, complimentary. (Not just your favorite shit)

*Circle the map, avoid the middle

*Get low in one on one engagements

5. You have a better chance of throwing a handfull of sniper rifle bullets and killing the enemy, than shooting them at him.

If the online multiplayer was laggy or if I was having an off day, I would hop on Spec Ops and do my own thing. If you had company who wanted to play as well, you could always do the split screen. I know that Combat Training is an option in Black Ops, but you need to be on Live to play against bots (which I don't get at all). I remember one day when I had a friend over and our internet went out so we booted up Spec Ops and beat every mission on the hardest difficulty in one sitting. That's still the most fun I've ever had on a video game. So am I in the minority here or do other people get nostalgic when they here the Juggernaut music? 

(I'm posting this because of all the goddam 13 year olds playing Black Ops right now. Half of the country is buried in snow so little Timmy gets to play CoD all day and scream into the mic! Not to mention them camping in a corner for the entire game with claymores and an AK74. /rant)

They are listening to our feedback and are working directly with the community. Their twitter and forums are strong and are always providing us with helpful official information.

Do I think that they are perfect? Absolutely not.Could they have done better? Hard to answer for I don't know how exactly such large-scale gaming works but I would say that yes, they probably could have done better have they worked on the game for a bit longer. But for a game of such great scale, they are doing incredibly well. Some may say that they should be better prepared and I would agree with you there. This doesn't change how I feel about the company.

Do I believe they will fix all the big issues? Wholeheartedly.

I do feel incredibly sorry for the PS3 guys, you fellas deserve good experience the same way us 360 guys are getting. PC I can't comment for I only play this game on 360 and PS3.

Another thing to note, some issues arise not because of Treyarch but because of our networks. In MW2 I was never able to find games on 360. Then I read about NAT and all that gibberish and managed to fix it. My friend on 360 who I live with is now having same issues that I have had with MW2 on BO....guess what? His NAT is strict. Whilst I am playing fine on same network, he can't get into a single game. There is no doubt that Treyarch have fucked up some network things, but before you blame them just make sure you have done everything on your end. This is more of an advice then defense. 

**TL;DR**

In my eyes, Treyarch are trying their best to provide us with best experience. There are a few bumps but I believe that if we are a little bit more patient it will all be fixed very soon.

Peace

Everyone is worried about their little e-peens and how many kills they can get with how few deaths. Now in TDM and DM that's the point yes, but in every other game mode... it doesn't matter at all.

I have had to leave CTF servers because no one on my team would defend the flag. Well, let me rephrase that. We had 9 people on the team, and 7 of them were camped around the flag with machine guns and sniper rifles. When the flag was taken they would not leave their spots. I'm not being hyperbolic here. They would not leave their positions at all and would just let the flag get capped.

You see while they had 0 caps and 0 returns, they had 27 kills and 2 deaths. If they went after the flag they might die, so they wouldn't appear as good as they could on a statistics board.

I've gotten 90 and 100 kill scores, but I had 40-50 deaths, because I was running my ass ragged capturing flags or HQs, defending them, being the first one to charge in so we can take a bomb site, you know playing the GAME. Where as in many an SnD, or Demolitions, or HQ the ""top"" 3 players on the team were more than happy to let us lose every HQ, or the bomb to go off, so long as they got to stay in their perch on the catwalks of the missile launch bay and weren't ever in any danger.

So let's make it simple, just don't show kills or deaths. Show caps, returns, how many HQs they've captured or destroyed, successful plants, just don't let them pad their stats.

In fact don't even record that at all, so it can't be used to pad any statistics. This won't stop achievement whores who are trying to get their 300th sniper rifle kill, but it's a step in the right direction, and would only improve gameplay.

But that's just my opinion on the matter.",,False,self,t5_2rq1o,False,,pc,True,t3_eblho,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/eblho/heres_a_modest_proposal_if_its_not_tdm_dont_show/,

1304106374.0,55,self.codbo,h0ddd,A lot of people on r/codbo seem to wonder why campers are so hated.,onefingerattack,94,39,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/h0ddd/a_lot_of_people_on_rcodbo_seem_to_wonder_why/,"So I'll try to explain it in a logical fashion without the usage of colourful phrases such as ""camping noob!"" and ""wtf u faggot ass camper"".

A lot of people on this subreddit seem to have the following argument:

&gt;I don't get all the hate towards campers! I mean, I know where they are! I'll just return and get a free kill!

1. Pretend for a moment that you're on a 10 killstreak and that you're one kill away from your beloved puppies. You're in beast mode! You're breaking jaws and making laws and kicking ass and taking names! You're certain that those pooches will be dining on enemy flesh! THEN... out of nowhere, some dude who is sitting in an obscure corner shoots you in the back. [You're pissed off](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWaLxFIVX1s). You're livid. And to make things worse, you watch the killcam, only to find out that the guy had been aiming down his sights well before you even entered the equation. Yea... he's a sitting duck and yea, you can return for the revenge kill... but that's not a worthy compensation. Why? Because your killstreak is over. One kill isn't going to bring that back.

2. Pretend for a moment that you're playing a FFA game and that there are 9 players (including yourself). Now pretend that you are the only person who is playing aggressively. You're the type of guy who is out for some fast-paced fun. You want gun fights and lots of one on one confrontations. However, because the rest of the players in the lobby think that they're Anne Frank and that the Germans will be here at any moment, your entire game is spent trying to smoke them out of their holes. You try to use explosives, but they're wearing Flak Jacket. You try to attack via the main entrance, but they're lying prone and aiming down their sights. You try to sneak up on them but they've got the motion sensor and you don't have Hacker Pro. The entire gameplay has been slowed down. It's not a fast-paced arcade FPS anymore; it's a mind-numbing game of hide and go seek. There are no one on one confrontations. There is no excitement. The game ends and you win; but you barely managed to scrape 20 kills in 10 minutes.

3. Beyond campers who are actually new to the game and don't know their way around the maps, you have another type of player. This guy is on his 6th prestige and his sole purpose in life is to increase his Kill Death Ratio. He doesn't give a shit if he's capping flags or not. He doesn't care about whether his team wins or loses. His sole mission in life is to increase his e-peen. This guy is a Conquistador and Call of Duty Black Ops is his Americas. He will pillage and plunder the game for a statistic. Finishing a game with 3 kills and 0 deaths is perfectly fine for this guy. He'd much rather finish with a 3.0 KDR than tarnish his record with 20 kills and 10 deaths. Does he want to improve his gameplay? Does he want to become more accurate? Does he want faster reflexes? No. He is perfectly happy to wait and wait and wait until somebody runs by so that he can catch them while they are unaware. This guy will rage quit a game if he can't get into his favourite camping spot on time. People hate this kind of camper, not because he killed them, but because of his motives.

A few issues spring to mind:

- The subreddit stylesheets have a limit. This means that we can't append everyone's gamertag/id to their reddit username.

- Even if you do get your GT appended to your username, other's are completely unaware as to what timezone/location you're living in. For instance, someone from Belgium would have difficulties playing with somebody from California, because of time differences and (more importantly) latency issues.

- ""Hook-up threads"" are ok. i.e. somebody posts a thread saying ""Hey guys, I'm on XBox... add me."" However, they take away from the content of the subreddit. They're also disorganized, in the sense that your ""Hook-up"" thread might only get seen by a small set of people.

- Different people prefer different game modes and playlists. You may be in the same location as another Reddit, but if he/she loves Search and Destroy and you detest it, it's not really that helpful.

- Some people don't like talking over their mics. Others do.

So, I've made an *attempt* at fixing these issues. What I've done is created a [custom PHP application](http://waynewexford.byethost22.com) that is specifically tailored to fit the needs of Redditors that play Call of Duty. The site allows you to submit all of your details and search for other Redditors by:

- Platform
- Location/Timezone
- Games (MW2, Black Ops, COD 4)
- Game modes (Search, Domination)
- Microphone usage

You can use the above attributes to narrow down your search.

The site can be [accessed here](http://waynewexford.byethost22.com). Bear in mind that it's still in its early stages and that there may be a few bumps (bugs) in the road. Also, it's on a free host at the moment, so there may be a few performance issues.

Therefore, I'm going to help you all accomplish what may finally be the ultimate goal of this subreddit, for redditors to link up and play with other sane players over XBOX LIVE/PS3/PC. Now, seeing as I'm an XBL'r, I'm going to have a few more tips for that crowd, but don't worry, there should be ample tips for everyone.

First, DO NOT make a self post or link post about wanting to play with others. Many will ignore it and you will get mostly people who also do not play with redditors very often.

The best thing to do, to start, is to head on over to the sidebar and click the *add your details* link. Follow the directions given there. This will add your info to a huge spreadsheet composed of the majority of players in this subreddit. You can then access the spreadsheet through the *find other players* link in the sidebar. Sort by columns that would increase your likelihood of finding a player who is online. Send them a friend request, making sure to note that you are from reddit.

A second method is to go on IRC, which can also be found in the sidebar. IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, let's you realtime chat with others on the channel. I feel tat this is probably the absolute best way to contact people, however there are very few people on IRC and I frankly find it quite disappointing.

A method for XBOX LIVE users (if this exists on PS3 please alert me) is to send a friend request to the XBL accounts: ""redditors"" or ""redditCODBO"" you don't have to be accepted to view the friend list of either of these two accounts, which are composed entirely of redditors, and it will furthermore tell you when said redditors are online.

I hope this helps.

EDIT: Added some tips from the comments

* SotaKenraali recommends that you have a headset, because voice comunication abilities will make people want to play with you more. No one likes to play with the mute who had to wait 2 weeks to get Turtle Beaches after his cat chewed up his regular mic. Just kidding, dude.

* Diabetic Joe recommendeds using the gamertags appended to people's names to find players. This is somewhat effective, however it is really a shot in the dark and since many of the people who appended their username have been playing a bit longer, their friends lists might be full, and you have no idea if they are online or when they will next be online.

* Personal tip: people don't care about your skill level. I've played with redditors whose k/d is .1 and I've played with redditors whose k/d is 2.5. As long as you aren't a dick, have fun, and be a fun and constructive person to play with, people will want to play with you.",,False,self,t5_2rq1o,True,,360,True,t3_fvunk,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/fvunk/how_to_play_with_redditors_the_definitive_guide/,

I have loved these things like no other, gaming is very important to me, and I'd just like them to end up with someone who will actually appreciate them.

They are a bit older, I've had them for about a year and half and recently upgraded to a pair of Tritton AX Pro's. I don't need them anymore and I'd like to give them to somebody who has yet to use a gaming headset, and hopefully they'll be pleasantly surprised at how much they can help. 

The only catch is, I've lost the talk-back cable. So, you'd be able to hear through the headset, but not communicate. That being said, you can find the talk-back cable [here](http://www.turtlebeach.com/products/recertified-products/ear-force-x3/livetabid/6063.aspx) for $6. 

If you live in the United States, and if you'll cover shipping, they're yours.

I'll start!

No seriously. I rarely even move anymore. I don't even bother keeping my thumb on the left analogue stick. For the majority of the game, I just sit in a doorway or an obscure corner, aiming down my sights, waiting... just waiting... for some poor soul to run by so that I can shoot him in the back. Yea, it can get a bit boring. But who cares? My KDR is 2.9 million to 1, bitch! For equipment, I switch between claymores, motion sensors and the camera spike. Basically, anything that will help me camp my ass off to the MAX! 

2: I got me some Second Chance. Hell yea motherfucker!! Sure, it makes me look like a gigantic bitch, but who cares? Certainly not my kill-death ratio! Hahahahaha! Now, I don't have to worry about winning gunfights. Hell, I don't even try to shoot first anymore! I just wait until I land on my ass and then let my pistol rip. 

3: I started using the RC Car. Seriously. Spy Planes are for chumps who like to appease their team mates. Chamberlain tried to appease a man once: His name was Hitler! Why would I use a stupid spy plane when I can drive an annoying-ass remote control car around the map? I can even camp and drive that bitch at the same time. Hahaha! My team mates? They can all get cancer and die. It's not my fault that they've decided to capture flags and plant bombs.

4: When I'm playing Domination, I place my ass in a window or in a corner somewhere and rack up those kills. Hell-to-the-motherfuckin-yeaaaah, biatch! Why would should I worry about capturing flags? Flags are for ultra-nationalistic morons who have a shitty KDR. Yea, yea, yea, I know, I should go and play FFA or TDM or something because they're kill-based game modes. But you know what? Fuck that. I killwhore in Domination because the enemy players are far too concerned with the objectives to come and stop me. Got a problem with that? Yea? Well too bad, because I can't hear you over the sound of my dogs! Wait... why you so mad bro? I was only defending the flags! pppppffffctttthhhhhhhht

5: If you are within a five mile radius of me, I will try to knife you. In fact, whenever I have to move to another spot on the map, I just spam the knife button along the way. You know. Just in case somebody appears in front of me.

I’ve chosen what I feel were questions that were relevant and actually provided some new or important information. I’ll be splitting up the questions into the general section and the PC section because, let’s be honest, after MW2 and IWnet, there were plenty of PC players that wanted to know more about PC version and because there really weren’t any questions about the 360/PS3 or event the Wii versions aside from the cross-platform multiplayer question (which you could guess the answer to), it only makes sense to divide up the questions. There were several occasions where the moderator had to remind people to ask gameplay, console or singleplayer related questions because so many PC questions were being asked.

*General*


im unsure about the reporting a cheat feature, how will you be able to look at thousands of reports? and what do you have inplace for bogus reports?
&gt; So, we have people at Treyarch who have a full-time job of monitoring all of the games you guys play. They also review the stats for cheaters reported by the game and cheaters reported by other players.


Is there any new features or changes to the online network that will either improve connection quality or make it easier for friends to play with each other?
&gt; Many to help you play with Friends. All versions of the game have a built in Friends list, for example. This can often be quicker than using the PSN or Xbox versions.


How long we need for lvl50 (Playtime)
&gt; It's tuned for about 24 hours of playtime. The best players in the building can do it in 20 or 21. Make sure you do the Challenges and it goes quick.


Will ""spawn-tubing"" (firing a grenade launcher from one team's spawn to the other) be changed, gimped, or completely blocked in Black Ops?
&gt; One of our tier 1 perks is called Flak Jacket. It protects you from explosive damage. I roll with this perk all the time to frustrate noob tubers. As to spawn tubing... we've added a grenade launcher and grenade delay to the beginning of every match. So even if people fire them, they won't detonate for the first 5-10 seconds.


Can you give us any total numbers for the amount of guns, reticule colors, maps, emblems or anything else that would be cool to know?
&gt; We have over 40 unique weapons, including 2 special weapons that only appear rarely in Care Packages... the Death Machine and Grim Reaper. There are 16 camo patterns, over 500 emblems, 14 maps... I could go all day on numbers. Custom red dots are about 30-35


Are there any special bonuses for prestiging in black ops?
&gt; Many. Custom Classes. Colored Clan Tags. 15 bonuses. 1 for each of the 15 prestige levels. Including some unique backgrounds for your personalized emblem. Including one that so hot your keyboard would catch on fire if I told you what it was. Guess you'll have to get to level 15. Prestige level 15, that is.


Are you guys planning on supporting Black Ops as much as World at war in the terms of DLC?
&gt; We will absolutely support Black Ops DLC after launch. We plan on promoting the game post-launch this time even more than on World at War.


If you do a lot more damage to an enemy will you get more points for the assist like in WaW or is it a set assist score no matter what?
&gt; Yeah, it's just like in World at War. You always get more assist points for doing more damage.


Do all weapons have gold camo and what does it take to unlock gold camo?
&gt; All primary weapons have gold camo. As to what it takes to unlock them... you'll have to Prestige to find out!


Will Black Ops have a Coop campaign similar to World At War? 
&gt; Two forms of co-op in Black Ops. Combat Training (play vs Practice Dummies) and Zombies (play with your friends). Both are games where you fight AI + Campaign co-op wasn't something we decided to persue because it didn't make sense for the type of story we were trying to tell.


What other than score will be visible through the leaderboards?
&gt; We actually totally ditched the old leaderboard systems and started over. In Black Ops, we use a Score per minute Average on weekly, monthly, and all-time leaderboards. This has a lot of advantages because it doesn't reward just the players who play alot, but those who play the best. You can still check all those stats that were in the old leaderboards + in something new we have called the Combat Record. It's an in-game stats viewer.


Do headshots matter, particularly with the more powerful assault rifles? In mw2 stopping power created a situation where many guns killed in two hits regardless of whether or not you aimed for the head. Since BO does not have stopping power, do any of the full auto weapons have damage that is this high?
&gt; We certainly have a hit multiplier for the head. So, it matters. But since we don't have Stopping Power so most guns are 3-5 shots. Only less if a headshot. + One final point. A headshot is NOT ALWAYS a one shot kill. But it does matter. A lot.


Will there be a votekick feature (console, pc)?
&gt; It depends on the server but the vote kick feature works for PC. How we do that for OFFICIAL RANKED we are still kicking around (on/off by default) Unrented Rank will be admin controlled/option. Consoles do not have a vote kick. They do, however, have a 3 strike rule. Private Matches on consoles can disable people from joining. If you do that, you don't have to kick someone.


will friends be able to join a started zombie game if someone leaves?
&gt; You can't join a Zombie game in progress.


Is there going to be a game list where players can see and join custom games or does the creator have to invite people?
&gt; When you create a Custom Game, you have the ability to save it to your own personal File Share. Once it's in your File Share, anyone in the community can search for it and place it in their File Share as well. Your friends will be able to look at your File Share as well. Things other than Custom Games that go into your File Share: Films, Clips, &amp; Screenshots.


Is TWar back in codbo?
&gt; I've previously announced that WAR will not be returning to Black Ops. We talked about it a lot. We fought about it even more. In the end, it didn't fit. War has it's fans and I love those people. Sometimes you have to make unpopular decisions for the best intrests of the game production. 


In Theater Mode you can record gameplay..but can we also record others voices through there mic (IN-GAME CHAT)
&gt; No, you cannot record other players' voice chat in your Films, unfortunately. There were too many privacy concerns, and even if we wanted to do it, there is no technical way to pull it off on the consoles yet.


For the Fmas is there a burst fire mode?
&gt; No.


Will information gathered from multiplayer be used to trend information on weapons, perks, damage, etc? For example a combination of weapons and perks becomes unblanced, will this be easily visable?
&gt; We have all new analytics this game. We can track popularity. Rank progression. We have the best tools we've ever had for seeing how the game is working in the real world


*PC*


what server settings can we change on a ranked server on the pc side?
&gt; I saw a recent version of RCON. It's a lot of settings for both rented ranked and even more for unranked. I am working with @pcdev to get the FAQ updated.


is FOV changeable in the pc version?
&gt; Yes it is. The last time I looked at it personally you could take it to 80.


Unranked or Ranked for tatical realism servers on the pc?
&gt; For a PC gamer, I would think you would be happier with Unranked. Ranked does have hardcore and barebones, however. That's fairly tatical in nature.


Is there a way to remotely kick people?
&gt; Yes, you will be able to kick and ban from your ranked servers.


How will wager matches work on the PC? will it use dedicated servers that are up by Treyarch? if so, what will happen if all the slots in those servers are taken at one point?
&gt; We have officially ranked Wager Match servers. Once the 6 fill up, the server doesn't allow anymore in. Think of it like a Dedicated Server with 6 slots. Run by us.


Will PC users be able to edit their MP configuration?
&gt; You can edit the same configs that you've always been able to edit, but those changes are not supported by Treyarch.


Can we create mixed playlists such as CTF and S&amp;D on the same ranked server?
&gt; You can tell the server which base Playlist and then you can do exclusions. So as long as we have a playlist with mixed modes, you'll be able to customize from their. For example: Ditching a map you don't want in rotation.


So what time do you think mod tools will be released?
&gt; No ETA on mod tools release yet....


Is there now an answer to the Max amount of players we can have in Ranked and unranked servers on PC?
&gt; Current player counts are set to 18 players max on ranked and 24 on unranked, but these numbers are always tunable post-launch.


Any possibility of downloading some of the game files before release on Steam?
&gt; I am getting word that pre-load for Steam is going up ASAP. The servers might be a bit ""crowded.""


What weapons can we use on unranked servers?
&gt; You can play with all weapons on your unranked servers... ranked is where you'll experience the full rank progression of competitive play.


You said wager matches are hosted by Treyarch , however how does this really work? Am I going to get a good ping only if I live in the US?
&gt; Ok. So, we have servers all over the place. Not just the US. And we can re-configure them however we want as as demand dictates.


Will leaning return in the PC version? 
&gt; Yes. On Q and E by default with a procedural lean. It looks great and works really great in hardcore modes if you ask me.

As you already know - the Call of Duty subreddits have always been fragmented into separate subreddits, based on particular games in the series. That probably won't change, as it's nice to have game-specific subreddits. However, having a main r/CallofDuty subreddit as the gateway to these other subreddits means that COD-playing Redditors will no longer have to travel from subreddit to subreddit like nomads in the desert. It also means that we have a place to discuss everything about about the series. See a cool Call of Duty 2 video? Want to discuss where the series is heading? Looking for a place to discuss COD 4 strategies? 

Another great advantage of this ""central hub"" is that it unites all Call of Duty players under one banner i.e. The guys from r/mw2, r/codbo and r/mw3 will get to voice their opinion and mingle, regardless of whether they've stopped playing MW2 or Black Ops.

Make sure that you pay [r/CallofDuty](http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/) a visit. We're still working on the design of the subreddit.

You know what that means...ATTACK DOGS. The lean, mean, one hit kill machines that run around and rip your opponents to shreds. What is, IMO, the best kill streak in the game is being sorely misused. I keep reading topics of discussion saying that dogs suck, they never get kills, etc. That's not because they suck, that's because you're sorely misusing them. Hard to believe, eh? Here's some strategy on how to use dogs effectively in Black Ops: 

8-9-11
Best killstreaks for the perfect Dogs setup. A lot of people like to use the spy plane, but I disagree. Spy planes can be shot down, Ghost users are invisible to it, and it keeps you glued to the minimap waiting for the next ping. Not to mention that the Blackbird will help you close out your killstreaks much quicker. I really like the blackbird because I'm a horrible closer in my killstreaks (not as much getting to 10, DEATH, then yelling profanities at your television). I'll discuss why the chopper gunner in the next part:

Chaos Strategy (the 9-11)
You just got your Chopper Gunner, awesome! Time to lay some waste to all these bitc-NOT SO FAST. Do not use Chopper Gunner right away, trust me, I'm a doctor. Instead, wait for your last two kills to come in. If they don't, you always have the chopper gunner. If they do...time to implement Chaos. Call both the Attack Dogs and the Chopper Gunner in at the same time. Guess what? The enemy has nowhere to hide. Everyone trying to shoot down your chopper gunner will be hunted by your dogs and everyone trying to take out your dogs will be shot up by your chopper gunner. Now for getting your teammates to help you.

Operation Lassie (Follow the Dogs)
Tell your teammates to follow the dogs. Simple enough. The dogs are like homing missiles which zone in on an enemies location and hunt them down by using raycasts and possibly A* pathfinding algorithms! Just tell your teammates to follow the suckers, protect your dogs, and enjoy!

Features Domination gameplay, Sabotage gameplay and gameplay from all the Wager Matches.


General info from the video:

-The helicopter that sends in care packages is slower. Players are able to shoot it down and the care package will land wherever the plane was hit.

-You no longer need to complete challenges to unlock camo. You unlock access to any camo you want at level 22 and buy any one you want if you have enough CoD Points.

-In Wager Matches, the lead player will show up as a yellow blip on the radar.

-Maps will be modified in Wager Matches, certain areas will be blocked off.

-In the Sharpshooter Wager Match, for every guy to pick off, you don't get streaks but bonuses, as in new perks. It is the only Wager Match mode to feature perks.


GunGame:

-Picking off multiple players with the same weapon (for example, taking out 4 players with one rocket launcher) will not boost the player up 4 tiers. You will still move to the next tier.

-Knifing players with the ballistic knife (the final weapon) will count as a knife, thus demoting the opponent affected but does not affect the player using it. In other words, you need to actually fire the ballistic knife at the opposition in order to win the GunGame.


Some new info from the video include how perks will be bought. This information can be found starting at 00:12:55.

-Once you gain access to Create-a-Class, you have the ability to buy any perk you want (just the normal version of a perk, not the pro version)

-In order to get the pro version, you need to complete 3 challenges for that perk in order for the pro version to be unlocked.

-When it's unlocked THEN you will be able to buy it.

So essentially, in order to get to the pro version of a perk, you need to complete the 3 challenges associated with it and then buy it. That seems a bit strange to me.",,False,self,t5_2rq1o,True,,,True,t3_dzscl,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/dzscl/one_hour_of_black_ops_multiplayer_gameplay_with/,

I swing around a corner, slicing the pie like I was taught in the ARMY.  My heart skips a beat when I see a guy standing still looking in another direction.  I can already count the kills my hele will get in my head and figuring my KDR for the game.  Within .5 of a sec I pull the trigger near his left foot while scoping in and strafe a whole clip up his head and back down to the ground just in case he goes into final stand.  

The next thing I see is death and his killcam.  I never fired a shot.  He had time to turn, scope in, fire 3 shots, move and fire 3 more shot.  The whole time I am standing there picking flowers.  

I rage and the same thing happens several times through the game.  When the game is over, that guy has 4 bars and I have 3.  My connection is 12mb down and 6mb up (true, tested on the PS3), quite good for my area of the country.  My PS3 is on LAN, in DMZ, and NAT open.

This is actually noted in the description, but I had overlooked it.
* In addition to SAM Turrets, Care Packages, and Sentry Guns, Valkyrie Rockets can be rerolled with Hardline Pro.
* Invincibility while falling is a design feature of Second Chance.
* Hardended Pro reduces flinch by a LOT more than I knew; 80% (suddenly got a lot more viable, imo...).
* The Willy Pete does 20 damage if you're right on it when it explodes (35, if you bonk them with it).
* Full auto on the CZ75 does less damage at close range.
* Despite having different Accuracy values in the UI, the Makarov and the M1911 have identical accuracy stats.

Just some interesting stuff I found. Probably a lot of you knew some/all of it, but it seemed like fun little facts, and maybe someone will learn something cool.

BONUS (these might be more common knowledge than the rest, but interesting regardless-- I skipped them because I was familiar with them, and realized everyone might not be):

* The L96A1 is a one hit kill to the torso, upper arms, neck, and head. This is the only gun that has different hitboxes for the upper arms. The only parts of the body that the L96A1 is *not* a OHK on are the forearms and legs.
* Suppressors reduce the range before damage drops off, but not the damage itself. For example, a gun might do 30 damage up close and start to drop off to 10 damage at 25m. A suppressor would reduce the point at which it drops off-- so it would do 30 damage to 15m, where it would start drop off to 10 damage. The exception is sniper rifles, which drop from 70 damage to 50 damage at all ranges. Since damage to certain areas is modified, that means that Suppressed snipers CANNOT get a OHK in Core against a full-health opponent.
* Hitting with a grenade appears to be FIFTEEN damage. I was wrong in the OP-- corrected.",,False,self,t5_2rq1o,True,,,True,t3_ea3n7,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/ea3n7/i_was_checking_out_weapon_and_perk_stats_and_i/,

You guys are really my only hope for a possible fix at the moment until I hear back from Treyarch (as Activision apparently won't adjust levels/prestiges/COD points/etc. for any reason on the PC).

Also, I'll throw in a preemptive caveat; I've never cheated, hacked, boosted, been in a hacked server, etc. in my 244 hours of MP playtime. This appears to be completely due to some disconnection with the BO servers or something. I don't really know. Also, in my browsing of the Steam forums for an answer, I didn't once come across this exact bug happening to anyone else. There were people that got completely wiped back to vanilla level 1, but I can't find an example of anyone else just losing x number of prestige levels for no f*cking reason.

I'm 39 years old, wasn't a console gamer until a couple of years ago and man, did I suck pretty hard at Call of Duty games. Not from want of trying. I've logged many many many hours sucking hard. I read every post where someone like me was like, ""I suck, how do I get better?"" There's always good advice, but nothing really helped me that much to be honest. 

But, man, I've suddenly turned it around and it's all due to the Combat Training mode where basically they set you up with bots to play against (I play at normal difficulty). Now this is in no way as hard as playing with real people, but that's kind of the point. 

Case in point: I was terrible with the knife. Always have been. I always got beaten to the punch or I was fruitlessly swinging in mid-air while being gutted. I set up combat training, and I would ONLY use the knife for kills. Now, in real multiplayer, I usually get at least 3 knife kills a game. Which is a vast improvement on zero. I swear, if you added all the previous COD games I've played together, I'll bet I've never gotten more than 15 knife kills TOTAL. Like ever. You can see where I'm going with this. Suck at the sniper? Use it exclusively in combat training. Pistol? Launchers? Yeah, whatever you feel weak with, play a few games in combat training and you'll find yourself doing significantly better in real online play. 

If you are cowering, terrified like I was, you really have a hard time getting to know the lay of the different maps. However, in Combat Training you can run around more and get acquainted with the maps without the fear of letting down your teammates. It's a great way to get acquainted with the maps consequence free. 

Finally I will say, now before I dive into multiplayer, I always play at least one Combat Training game on my weakest map for warm up. It's worked wonders. My last game (in true DM multiplayer)I went 13 and 4 with several knife kills and several downed aircraft, which while not ""rapage"" was unthinkable only a few days ago.

TLDR: Combat Training is a great way to work on your weaknesses in a consequence-free environment. ",,False,self,t5_2rq1o,True,,,True,t3_e9uti,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/e9uti/to_those_who_suck_and_think_they_cant_get_better/,

* Lobby set to 'Local Only'
* NAT Open.
* Xbox connected direct to the modem (Ethernet)
* Playing late at night when I knew would be less sharing the contention on line to the exchange.
* What I thought was a good connection (about 8mb down 1mb up).

No matter what I tried I would rarely get more then three bars.

Not being prepared to accept this and getting more angry with consistently seeing kill cams show someone about half a second in front of me, got me seeking a solution.

I found a forum around my ISP provider 'sky uk' and a thread on ping time. The suggestion was that most ISP's have 'profiles' that they set for users. The typical standard out of the box profile set is with more download speeds in mind then 'ping time' and ping time is the one you really want for gaming. Apparently it was explained that if you called your ISP explicitly state to them your primary use the connection is for online gaming and you need a better ping, they will normally change your profile (better routing and a lower max limit (typical seems to be max limit = 8).

So I phoned to my ISP's broadband customer services. I got a lady on the phone who seemed to know just what I needed. She did some tests and put me on hold. After 2 minutes she came back and said try now....

I still have the results:


** Pre Change: **

&gt; ** Pingtest.net 20ms (Grade A) **

Looks like we got somewhere!

Next I loaded Black OPs and went into ground war (normally bad ground for me). I got 4 solid bars!

I have now played about 10 games and each one - bang! 4 bars. I am even doing better in the game itself and it seems playing at a disadvantage has now made me a better player now I have an equal ground to others.

Granted this may not be for everyone..I just thought I should put this up as if it helps someone as much as it has me, it's worth it all the more.

** EDIT **

Bit more research...Seems there are also two modes with a DSL line: [interleave or fastpath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastpath#Interleaving_and_fastpath)..

Interleaving is an error correction protocol that is implemented on your line at the DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer - these are the baby's they have at your local exchange which connects all the lines to the internet backbone). The good thing about Interleaving is it can notify your router of bad packets. The largest drawback to Interleaving is that it will increase your ping time, specifically to your first hop gateway router.

FastPath allows the DSLAM to pass the data received from you to the first hop router without performing any error correction. As a result, marginal lines could experience an increase in packet loss and decrease in sync stability, but TCP/IP has its own error checking so it's already covered off at the other end. Now the good thing about FastPath is that it has lower ping times, especially to the first hop router. 

With online gaming you are not so concerned with the volume and rate at which you can pull down data, your more concerned with how quickly you can get small packets to the host - the quicker they get there the quicker you get a hit marker.

I have a suspicion I may have had this changed and perhaps the routing. 

It's worth a try even if we don't know the specific details as your ISP has probably had to think about this a few times before when other gamers have called up. You can always mention politely that its bothering you to the point that you are considering changing ISP - may give them a bit more incentive to tweak your connection.

As a rusher, the only viable weapons left are the shotguns or 74 with steady-aim.  If I'm LUCKY enough to be registered as having shot then it might kill them.

I am at work and curious, any improvements in knife lunge distance that are noticeable? 

Are parties more consistent i.e. have the difficulties with joining games with your friends and being booted for no reason been fixed?

Ninja Pro- have you noticed significant change in sound levels?

Lastly- sniping. Are we noticing ""easier"" kills? 

EDIT:

**There are also new contracts**

**I feel your pain my PS3 brothers, I hope it gets fixed for you very quickly and you can enjoy the same experience as some of 360 people do :(**


EDIT 2:

SOmeone asked for details of the patch. Here you go:

Issues Addressed:

    * Resolved several issues with parties getting disbanded unexpectedly.
    * Additional measures to prevent the “Transmission error” and other disconnects. This was most likely to occur with large parties where party members had mixed NAT types. (PS3 only)
    * Addressed an issue with VOIP icons not appearing when USB headsets were plugged in prior to game launch. (PS3 only)
    * Updated handling for UPnP-enabled routers to improve matchmaking conditions where users had strict or moderate NAT types. Also added in-game communications so that all players are aware of their NAT type in the Player Match party lobby.
    * Addressed issue that prevented the “Load MP by Default” option from saving when other specific option combinations were set. (Xbox 360 only)
    * Prevention of exploit that allowed players to keep custom classes and killstreaks after prestige.
    * Addressed an issue where Flak Jacket Pro would not always protect against ground fires left by Napalm Strikes.
    * Prevention of users losing their killstreak reward when switching classes at the start of a new round in round-based game modes.
    * Addressed an issue where the incorrect perks would appear when spectating another player under certain circumstances.
    * Added round start explosive delay to China Lake grenade launcher to give it the same round start limitations as other explosives.
    * Contracts will now reset when the player Prestiges.
    * Prevention of Valkyrie rocket exploding upon release under rare conditions.
    * Prevention of Gunship failing to give player full control under rare conditions.
    * Prevention of an issue where a player will get teleported outside the map boundaries under very specific circumstances.
    * Additional security measures to enhance detection and banning capabilities.

Gameplay Tuning:

    * Limit the ability to re-roll supply drops using Hardline Pro to Care Packages only, no other killstreak drops.
    * Added a negative influencer to all spawn points to decrease the chances of spawning near an enemy. This will further improve spawning protection on top of previous updates.
    * Additional sound mix tuning for Ninja Pro users – increased ranges and volume of enemy footsteps, and removed player footstep sounds on concrete material types.
    * Increased headshot multipliers for sniper rifles. Sniper rifles with suppressors equipped will now always be ensured one-shot kill headshots.
    * Subtle increase in sniper rifle accuracy when scoping in.
    * Added a render delay to the red diamond player indicators that appear when controlling the Gunship, Valkyrie Rocket and Chopper Gunner. When a player first spawns, this will not appear for a period of time.
    * Additional minor reductions in knife lunge.

But some of them use more varied Nazi or WP imagery, such as the SS marks, 1488, or straight up KKK imagery.

While I LOVE LOVE LOVE being against them (I love killin' Nazis), I can't stand being on a team and working together with a hardcore racist. Which brings me to my favorite activity: Bigot Trolling.

This works best in Hardcore, where you can periodically TK the Nazis, or shoot them when they're almost back with the flag in CTF. You can trick them into TKing you, getting themselves kicked. In ordinary game modes, my favorite thing to do is wait (in CTF for example) until the enemy has scored once, then grab their flag and NEVER capture it, hiding with Ghost Pro. Sure, all of these strategies involve taking a loss, but if it means taking down WPs, then I'll do it with a smile on my face.

Most people aren't really aware of how beast this perk is once it's pro. Besides the fact you don't get affected by any tactical (even when you flash yourself), when do you get hit markers for having flashed someone, it shows what direction the flashed person is in. I didn't know this second part but shit is fucking coooool. 


But yes, I must admit and preface that getting that shit was ANNOYING. Some of you probably can read this and think I'm a newb or w/e but most of my friends in my codbo community hold getting that pro perk in high regard.


Some tips on how to get it quicker though

*Do concussions first to get Warlord Pro fast

*Scavenger is essential once you switch to novas

*Use novas like claymores, (I got it through TDM, no throwing them at points for cheap kills and shit, I earned these mother fuckers.) I put them in high traffic areas see the hit mark, run behind them and knife them, or longshot. By putting them in spots they HAVE to go through, you 1) create a smokescreen and 2) control which way they are channeling.

Scavenger Pro, Warlord Pro, Tac Mask = Quickest Way to get it (loadout wise)


**TL;DR** Got TAC Mask Pro, shit was annoying... and more importantly I get too excited about things like this in video games.",,False,self,t5_2rq1o,False,,360,True,t3_fkktb,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/fkktb/so_i_got_tac_mask_pro_last_night_and_screamed/,

1293939187.0,37,self.codbo,eus4n,ZOMBIES Advice for you guys.,JSawa,39,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/eus4n/zombies_advice_for_you_guys/,"I'd like to share some strategies for the BLOPS map Kino Der Toten that my buddies and I have found to work out pretty well. We typically play split screen, as it's the optimal way to play, but I'll include SOLO at some point. Our highest round has been 45.

Kino Der Toten (Splitscreen):

**Round I:** Let the Zombies in. Shoot Zombies 2 or 3 times and then Knife. Repair **only FOUR** window panels for the max 40 points. *(NOTE: Do NOT buy any guns in the Lobby. You don't need them.)*

**Round II:** At the beginning of the round, Repair **only TEN** window panels for the maxiumum 100 points. Shoot Zombies 3-5 times and knife. It is at this point they should start dropping items like Insta-kill, Nukes, and **MAX AMMO**.

**Round III:** It's now okay to start repairing as many windows as need be to survive. Still try to let Zombies in so you can get items. Shoot Zombies at least 8 times and then knife, or double knife. *(NOTE: BE CAREFUL. Two hits and you're down. Wait until the red has faded before you even attempt another strike. Zombies are also known to windmill and DOUBLE SWIPE you.)*

**Round IV and V:** Be cautious at this point. The Zombies will start to get vicious. Shoot 8+ times and attempt to knife to survive to round five, but when you eventually get flooded, it's time to leave. Take the door to the top right then go right on through to the next door, where at the bottom of the stairs on the right will be an **MP40**. BUY this.

**Round VI-VII:** Unload as much of the pistol as you can for about 30 seconds and then use the MP40 to finish them off. Stay down at the bottom of the room with the turret. Watch your back, the steps, and the two windows. Toss frags at the top over the ledge to knock Zombies down. If you think you can finish off a Zombie with a knife at the end of the round, try it for extra points, but don't be risky. 

**DOGS should arrive at this point. My advice is to keep moving and not stay in one spot, but that's the best strategy I've found. Just constantly keep doing 360's and unload with the MP40.**

**Rounds VIII-X:** As with the lobby, you will eventually get flooded in this room, so stick near the door to the dressing room. When you get rushed, open it and book it to the stage. The stage is an OKAY place to camp for a little while, but you will definitely need to hit the power and **IMMEDIATELY buy Jugger-Nog and link up the Teleporter.**

**Rounds 11-15:** If you haven't already, get yourself a crawler. You do this by using grenades to blow off the zombies legs. The Zombie will live and buy you time to go and search for the Mystery Box. Locate the Box on the Map and go purchase your weapons.

BEST WEAPONS TO HAVE:

-**Ray Gun** (DOES NOT need to be upgraded until you A: Run out of Ammo or B: make it to round 20-22. This gun is massively important, because you can use it to blow off Zombies' legs instead of killing them, causing the game to actually STOP SPAWNING zombies when too many are rendered in the game. ESSENTIAL TACTIC!)

-**Monkies** (Essential to have. Distracts zombies for about 10 seconds, allowing you to RUN or SAVE your friends. Need I say more?)

-**HK11 and RPK Light Machine Guns** (IMPORTANT to buy QUICK RELOAD and DOUBLE TAP for these weapons. Tons of Ammo, will rack up lots of points, and when upgraded, does some hefty work.)

-**Thundergun** (DOES NOT need to upgraded until you run out of ammo and absolutely need to. PERIOD.) Essential gun to have for later rounds (30-40)

-**Assault Rifles (Commando, Famas, AUG, etc.)** These guns are NOT optimal to have in later rounds, but they are good for getting you points. I would avoid upgrading unless you feel that you absolutely need to.

OPTIONAL: **Bowie Knife &amp; Ballistic Knife Combo** (This combination allows for VERY fast knifing. It's pretty beast to have if you're quick and have jugger-nog. This will get you tons of points if you use it right. 1 hit kill up to round 11 and it's a 2 hit kill up to round 18.)

**Rounds 15-30:** I'll just provide some general tactics, because from this point on anything could happen. The idea is to stick by the teleporter until you get flooded. (DO NOT BE AFRAID TO USE THE TURRET TRAP FOR 1500. VERY HELPFUL.) When you do, get in and toss grenades from the Pack-a-Punch room. When you teleport back, SHOOT up the middle of the Lobby at as many Zombies as you can for about 5-10 seconds. **(WATCH YOUR BACK!!)** When you get flooded, do the ""Run Around"" and run up to the right of the lobby, back through the turret room, dressing room, and to the stage. (DO NOT BE AFRAID TO HIT TRAPS.)

Link up the teleporter, rinse, wash, repeat. Each round, attempt to get a crawler so you can buy items, ammo, and close off entrances.

When you get to round 20-25, you WILL get overrun by Zombies when you head back to the stage again. If the middle entrance back to the lobby is clear, HEAD THAT WAY AND DO THE LOOP AGAIN. If it isn't, and you can't link up the teleporter, GO TO THE ALLEY WAY through the door on the right. The Alley is your last stand escape route from the Zombies and fully completes the ""Big Loop"" around the map. At higher levels, you use this Big Loop to run &amp; gun the Zombies down.

**Rounds 30+:** I call this the *""Pointman - Pointsman""* strategy. This is how we survived all the way to 45, and if it wasn't for silly mistakes, we could have gone higher.

Whichever player has the Thundergun / Zeuscannon is the POINTman. His secondary gun should be NOTHING OTHER than an UPGRADED RAYGUN. Whoever is player two is the designated POINTSman. This is what you do: 

POINTman leads the way. He protects POINTSman. He uses the RAYGUN to attempt to BLOW OFF THE ZOMBIES LEGS (ie. NOT KILL) This prevents too many zombies from spawning, and protects the POINTSman at the same time. The POINTSman should aim to CONSERVE as much ammo as possible so that you can get Max Ammo's on the Dog rounds.

POINTSman will follow POINTman wherever he goes. He will buy wall guns, specifically the *MP40* in the Turret room, right before the dressing room, and the *Ak47u* in the Alley way. POINTSman will unload as many bullets into the Zombies as possible, even though he probably won't kill them. He will get a shitton of points, and use these points to hit Electric Traps and Turrets which will slaughter tons of Zombies. (NOTE: If the coast is clear, attempt to knife and kill crawlers. BUT DO NOT STOP MOVING.

I repeat, 

DO NOT STOP MOVING.)

Your route will be this EVERY round:

STAGE - Linked Teleporter &gt; Pack-a-Punch Room &gt; Lobby &gt; **WALK** and Hit first electric trap in the right of the Lobby &gt; **WALK** and Hit turret trap in room with the Quick Reload &gt; SPRINT to the stage &gt; WALK to the Alley way. Remember to fuel up on ammo with the wall guns. &gt; Hit the fire trap in the room near Double Tap &gt; WALK to the lobby &gt; do the ""Run Around"" again &gt; Hit the electric trap from the dressing room to the stage. &gt; Hit teleporter &gt; Alley &gt; Lobby &gt; Link Teleporter &gt; ""Run Around"" while hitting traps &gt; Use teleporter.

RINSE WASH REPEAT. Do not stop moving. Do not get trapped. Do not get cocky. It's very very hard to kill zombies with anything other than traps at high rounds. Use Monkies sparingly. Use Zeuscannon sparingly. You WILL need it.

I'm a little sick of writing now, but please feel free to comment.

It's a pretty solid game in it's own right.) When as I was leaving a bigger older dude was pre-ordering Black Ops for the PC. Right after the words ""PC"" left his lips a group of teenage douche nuggets behind him said exactly what was said in the title.

After that I stopped in my tracks.

I turned and looked at them. all looked to be around 15-16 years old ""bros"" in training. This guy is just trying to get a pre-order for a game and here he is being openly mocked because he want's to play the damn game on a platform of his choice. 

They didn't go farther than that, and my wife was pulling me out of the store so we can go to the god damned Sears already. ""Just wait, I want to see what else these cunts do"".

The guy gets his receipt and leaves with no further incident

I was ready to tear into them if they continued until I realized I would be no more better than they are and I am an older more mature person and should act like it. I don't know why but this rampant act of fan boy-ism got me worked up for nothing.

Well, at least he won't have to run into their kind on a well managed server.

tl;dr - Today's younger ""gamers"" make me genuinely angry. There is nothing wrong with playing on a 360 or PS3 and I own both consoles, but you don't need to act like self-righteous douche nozzles about it. At least there's a mute button on Live and ps3 right?

Comparing the two games is fucking stupid. They both have two **very different** styles of play. COD offers a fast-paced arcade shooter on (relatively) small maps. Battlefield offers a multitude of options/features for team work on larger maps. COD players usually prefer gun-on-gun action. Battlefield players like having destructible environments and fighter jets and vehicles and whatnot. In the end: It all comes down to what the player wants. In my case; I like jumping on and playing a few rounds of FFA or SnD. I have my fun. Then I log off again. Would I personally like fighter jets or jeeps in COD? Hell no.

Pick your fights. If in the process of engaging someone, you make the sudden realization that you may very well be at a disadvantage, walk away from that battle, or simply move around in a different area to gain positional advantage.

The visual impact of your gun being on the right makes turning to the right and strafing left easier as your fire arm holding side is visually attacking the enemy. This is purely psychological. Bullets actually come from the character model's centre, or head.

Therefore it is sometimes beneficial to strafe to your  right as you counter act the natural aim of other player to their right as they strafe to their left.

Also a large propotion of guns in Black Ops have a weighted recoil to the right, so strafing to your right, (the gun holders left), is of great advantage. It's all about missing your opponent's bullets.

It's purely situational though, if there's better cover to the left strafe there. But in the open in a duel mix it up a bit.

Also go one way *or* the other. Never both. Your object is to escape the enemy's auto aim, which is a slight magnetic lock (laugh all you want PC players). If you go back on your self as you strafe the enemy maintains this advantage.

**tl;dr strafe right aim left in the open in a 1 v 1**

* If your team mate gets a care package, and you see its ammo, run up and swap it for them, 9 times out of 10, they will get something better.

* I roll spy plane, couter spy plane, and care package. This netted me 20 killstreaks in one game of domination, having counter spy plane fills the gap Ghost leaves behind. If you play aggressive and forward, you shouldnt have a problem putting streaks together

* I tried a new tactic last night, I snuck around the enemy spawn, care package hunting. I saw an enemy CP drop, and killed the player who got it. Since I was in their spawn I knew I didnt have much time to pick up that chopper gunner that just dropped, so as soon as I heard gunfire in my direction, I swapped that chopper gunner in and turned their chopper gunner into an ammo crate.

1289879816.0,36,self.codbo,e6rf6,Nuketown: Tips to Keep You Alive,got_milk4,36,0,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/e6rf6/nuketown_tips_to_keep_you_alive/,"This is kind of a rage post as I've yet to be able to win a game on Nuketown as no one seems to know how to play the map. I'm going to list some tips I think people should know that will hopefully make them a better player at Nuketown!

**EDIT:** People are implying that I shouldn't be giving advice, blah blah, if I have yet to win a game on Nuketown. I will only say that I run an average kill/death of 3-4.0 on my Nuketown games. It's not that I can't win specifically, it's the fact that my teammates continually die and cost us the game.

First tip: **Defensive, not aggressive!**

There's two reasons for this, and the second reason I'll leave for the next tip. If you play an aggressive game on Nuketown, you WILL die. A lot. Due to the fact the map is so small it's easy to be overwhelmed with enemies, especially if you're playing with an uncoordinated team (e.g. playing with randoms). Stay back, and the other team will likely come to you. Stand your own ground, and only push forward if necessary. It seems a bit counter-productive but it will help you die less and if your team does it, win games.

Second tip: **Stay away from the middle.**

Nobody, and I mean nobody, can actually follow this. You DO NOT want to be in the middle of the map. Unfortunately due to the spawning system if you approach the middle of the map, even alone, your team will start spawning close to the enemy's current spawning position. Not only that, but napalm strikes and other assorted killstreaks will tend to be called in towards the middle of the map. The trailers and other hiding places will NOT protect you from these, whereas the houses will. Staying back means you have a closer place to take cover, not only from air support but if you've taken a few hits/need to reload. All the debris in the middle can be penetrated by bullets, and you can be gunned down behind cover. Being in the middle will get you nowhere fast *unless the other team happens to be absolutely awful*.

Third tip: **smoke, smoke, smoke!**

Smoke grenades are your friend on this map. If you throw them into the middle area it provides good cover to move amongst the first floor of the houses (especially the ~~garages~~ car holes). If smokes are deployed along the sides of the houses it provides decent cover from snipers who are not using an infrared scope, as it is not uncommon for snipers to wait along the sides of the houses to pick off what they can see. A nice smoke cover protects you and lets you blast enemies as they walk through the smoke trying to get to you.

Fourth tip: **pass on the RC-XD.**

The RC-XD is great and all, especially with the little shortcuts to get you from backyard to backyard, but realistically you will die while trying to get a kill with it. The map is just too small and crowded to give you enough time in any location to safely use the RC-XD without risking death. So what does that really do? Nothing - you've likely given the opposing team a point and your own team a point - but nothing has changed. Take the spy plane instead; it's not only good for knowing the enemy's location (obviously), but you can use it to spot if enemies are spawning behind you. You may not have time to react but what little time the spy plane gives you will be better than the no time at all you may have without it.

Fifth tip: **Sleight of Hand.**

This can be more of a personal preference for some, but I do recommend you have Sleight of Hand on your loadout for Nuketown. Because the map is so small, crowded and dangerous it's often you'll find yourself in a situation where you have just killed an enemy and need to reload, only to find yourself being gunned down during the process. Sleight of Hand will reduce that time needed greatly and let you get back into the fight faster. Couple Sleight of Hand with Scavenger and you're a one man killing machine.

These are just a few tips but they're important ones - try them and I would bet your K/D will improve and your team will stand a better chance.

1308431604.0,30,self.codbo,i35oq,Good news everybody - the new Reddit gamertag/id site is now fully functional. It has also been given some new features.,onefingerattack,35,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/i35oq/good_news_everybody_the_new_reddit_gamertagid/,"In relation to the [notice post](http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/hyjfz/rcodbo_notice_gamertagsfinding_other_redditors_to/) that was posted a few days ago, concerning the app over at [RedditGaming.net](http://www.redditgaming.net). Basically, I've added a number of features and fixed a few bugs.

**Search Features**

When it was first launched, you could only search by Platform, Timezone and Microphone. Shortly after the site was launched, a bug in the advanced search feature had reared its ugly head and forced me to take the entire thing down. Basically, the search feature was showing duplicate results. Fortunately, I managed to pinpoint the problem and fix it. This means that you can now search by:

- Platform
- Timezone
- Microphone
- Preferred Games (MW2, Black Ops etc.)
- Preferred Game Modes (TDM, Dom, FFA etc.)

i.e. you can now narrow down results and find Redditors that compliment your own Call of Duty gaming habits.

**Hosting**

When the site was first launched, it was situated on a crappy free web host. This meant that the application was sometimes slow and unresponsive. In fact, a few hours after I announced the site, I was forced to rewrite certain pieces of code/database queries; just because the free host in question had crappy default settings that brought the site down. Thankfully, a fellow Redditor (Reddit user [jargoone](http://www.reddit.com/user/jargoone)) was more than willing to give us free space on his hosting plan. He also registered a domain name (http://redditgaming.net) for the site. This was all done out of his own pocket, so may he bask in a million upvotes!

**Profiles**

Everyone that has submitted their details now has a ""profile"" of sorts. This profile details all of the information that you have submitted to us. In the future, jargoone and I hope to scrape services such as XBox Live for information on recent played games etc. It is hoped that this ""profile"" will help Redditors make more informed decisions on who to add as friends on XBL, PSN, Steam etc

**Login**

You can now login (using the password you registered with) and update your preferences and details. Sick of Domination? Well now, you can login and delete it from your preferred game modes. Entered the wrong details? No problem. 

**CSS**

The app can now be used to generate CSS for Call of Duty subreddits. The feature is available to anyone who is logged in. This means that COD subreddits can now generate the CSS that shows gamertags beside Reddit usernames. I might also add in a feature that chooses people at random, so that the gamertag CSS on subreddits can be changed once at week (i.e. we can rotate who has their gamertags shown beside their usernames so that everyone gets a look-in).

It is hoped that this system can act as the hub for all Call of Duty subreddits. Also - If you have any bug reports or recommendations etc, be sure to post them here.",,False,self,t5_2rq1o,False,,360,True,t3_i35oq,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/i35oq/good_news_everybody_the_new_reddit_gamertagid/,moderator

I've noticed a few players where it's obvious that they are just out to ruin other people's fun online, whether that be shooting your claymores, following and knifing you, or the worst - trapping you until an enemy runs by and kills you.  The other day I was 28 - 0, playing on Cracked, running over the other team, when I lay in a corner to use the chopper gunner.  There I was at 36 - 0, and when I came out of the killstreak, these two arseholes are laying down next to me blocking me in, firing their weapons to attract attention.  36 - 1.  

Do you feel that anything gets done when you report players for this, or are they just going to keep ruining peoples fun with no consequences? I've noticed a few comments in r/gaming saying that they deliberatley do this to players who take the game too seriously, with other redditors agreeing that this was in fact enjoyable to do.

I don't take COD as seriously as some people do, but for god's sake. I'm sure many play the game as a way of relaxing in their free time, and part of having fun is the ability to do well without some idiot out to ruin it.  Does anyone else share this frustration, or am I in the wrong to be making such a big deal?

1299287511.0,36,self.codbo,fxnbk,I would like to clear some things up regarding Kill Cam and Theater playback.,rederic,46,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/fxnbk/i_would_like_to_clear_some_things_up_regarding/,"Oftentimes, players will reference what they saw in a Kill Cam to support their claims of hacking and other sorts of foul play. Most of us have discovered by now that a Kill Cam or Theater recording is not an accurate representation of what the player saw during gameplay. For those who may not know, I would like to set the record straight *and* explain why.

The facts:

* The Kill Cam and Theater recordings reference the same data — known as a [Non-Playable Demo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_demo#Non-playable) — and reconstruct where the Host believed entities (character models, interactive objects such as grenades, kill streak rewards, etc…) were at intervals in time. The game renders this data to the best of its ability *without* the benefit of things like lag code to smooth things out and make them look believable.

* Kill Cams play back using the map's current state, not with its state during the time of the kill. Put simply, this means that if you are shot through unbroken glass and the glass pane breaks during the kill the glass will appear broken throughout the entire Kill Cam. This also applies to the particle effects for Willy Pete and Nova Gas grenades, and may cause smoke to appear invisible or nonexistent smoke to be visible during the Kill Cam.

* Due to the absence of lag correction, shots that appear off target may generate hit markers and vice versa. Similarly, you may fire off an entire magazine without appearing to fire a single shot in the Kill Cam. Some players refer to this as ""being *n* bullets behind"" — where *n* is the number of shots fired before the Host registers the first bullet.

* It is widely accepted that Kill Cams and Theater recordings play at a lower frame rate than normal gameplay.

These four factors are responsible for *almost* as much Kill Cam Rage as lag itself, and can result in some truly frustrating Theater moments. For example, your amazing tomahawk bounce or the Care Package rocketing up into the skybox after a bounce may not replay the way you remember them.

The game engine takes the known event data — player locations, firing start and stop times, grenade throws, equipment placement, etc… — and applies some fuzzy logic to fill in the gaps.

I'll update with any comments that shed more light on ""Killcam WTF?"" moments, and I apologize for being too lazy to find better sources.

**TL;DR: You can't trust the Kill Cam, and that guy probably isn't hacking.**",,False,self,t5_2rq1o,True,,psn,True,t3_fxnbk,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/fxnbk/i_would_like_to_clear_some_things_up_regarding/,

To unlock gun challenges you have to have bought that gun, so when you have spare cash to spend, you may aswell buy the guns that you dont use, so that when you pick them up off the floor you can gain xp from doing those gun challenges.

So if for instance you dont like the Enfield, there would be no point in buying it right?.....wrong. If you buy the gun you unlock the associated challenges with it. This way if you run out of ammo with your prefferd gun and are forced to pick up the nearest gun; an Enfield in this instance, you can still gain xp from getting the kill and headshot challenges, you might eventually get with it if you pick it up enough times.

I know its only a small amount of XP you will possibly gain from the easier gun challenges, and I also know that nearly everyone uses the same group of guns, but if you have spare cash, why not buy them and level up that little bit quicker.

I define rusher here as someone that *never* camps or defends an area, but also not someone that blindly gallops towards the enemy. I'm defining rusher here as a highly skilled player constantly attacking Duke Nukem stylee.

* AK47u; self explanatory. Most gun fights are in its kill range, it's the most effective all round gun by a long way. That's why it's 'overused'. It's screams killing efficiency. It's the ump40 &lt;3

* Dual mag; you'll be getting nothing but gun kills, rushing like a beast, the ability to do super-reloads keeps you in the fight. Whereas more ammo gets you that high kill streak reward without having to pick up someones silenced famas. You don't want a silencer you *want* people to know exactly where you are, you're a beast. Grip = negligible; and rapid fire negates medium range ability. Extended mags is accpectable..

* Flak Jacket pro; the benefits of nigh-on complete explosive invulnerability ensures you can disregard claymores and nades, allowing you to concentrate entirely on winning gun engagements. An advantage far greater than ghost. I personally love being on radar, I'm always moving so they'll be looking in the wrong direction by the time I get to them. (Hard line is an alternative if you have trouble stringing kills).

* Sleight of hand pro; in a game where 3-4 bullet kills are the norm, you'll run out of ammo after a single engagement, being replenished as quickly as possible is vital to success. Faster ADS is a clear advantage also. This is indisputably the most advantageous second perk.

* Ninja pro; if you're a head set user, with the recent patches, use ninja pro. This is an insanely great advantage. If you don't own a head set, unplug your earphones from your mp3 player and use them. The ability to instantly locate your enemy isn't one you should ever be without.

* Semtex; rushers shouldn't be cooking 'nades, it leaves them exposed.

* Concussion Grenades; faster release than flash, every micro second counts in a hectic deathmatch situation.

* Claymore; forget about equipment, lay a mine down then forget about it. You should be playing this like Quake, forget about the bells and whistles, you kill with your gun. Every now and again the claymore you put down in an oblique corner will say +100, it'll be a bonus. Motion sensor, the only other contender as a useful equipment would mean defending an area, not for impatient kills-whores like us.

* Killstreaks; you choice, but only killstreaks that don't require remote control, you're a moving tank, no choppers, work your way to dogs, they kill whilst you kill.

1292678415.0,32,self.codbo,enwdx,MW2 Vs. BlOps: map breakdown opinions,,43,11,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/codbo/comments/enwdx/mw2_vs_blops_map_breakdown_opinions/,"Here's a list of my opinions and an arbitrary rating of each of the maps shipped with both MW2 and BlOps, with references to CoD4 maps. 

It's all subject to preference although I've tried to remain objective in most cases. High ratings are given for innovation, balance, variance of sight lines, and empahsis on variance in tactics of play. 

I'm at home with my xbox at university, with exams to study for, so such a procrastination is due to severe CoD withdrawal symptoms :)

My thoughts:

**MW2**

* **Afghan** - excellent all round map based around perimeter play, was better for some objectives more than others, and could prove quite campy, but overall had enough varied cover points and counter points to keep it interesting, 8/10

* **Derail** - far too big, too much time spent traversing the map, only really suited to ground war, SnD became a game of who had the biggest balls to run the furthest, all other game types became a cluster fuck for the centre house. Big =/= better, 3/10

* **Estate** - a fight for the centre house in most game types, if you controlled this you controlled the game, thus justifying danger close for some people. Poor overall design in my opinion, it looked pretty, but  was ultimately a poor map 4/10

* **Favela** - excellent mix of interesting sight lines, roof top battles, and clever short cuts, one of MW2s best offerings, never got bored of it in most game types 8/10

 * **Highrise** - the perfect CoD map, equal peggings, slightly ruinged by OP spawn sniping, which I'm sure was fun for some. How can you dislike it? Perhaps a little too symmetrical? Nah this is a classic in even the FPS genre overall, 9/10

* **Invasion** - standard CoD gridded map affair, three main routes with interlinking buildings, see Crash, Strike, or District from CoD4. If it aint broke... 6/10

* **Karachi** – it sounded like a vaginal euphemism, but was actually a well designed map that had few routes through the centre but enough cover of each one that no one vantage point was imperious. The satellite dish was where control could be found, and it only had two and a half routes to it. A good map but not a great one 6/10 

* **Quarry** – dominated by the high ground towards one corner of the map with three viable routes up to that area all with sloped ground making anybody a sitting duck, all TDMs became a struggle to control this area, with the buildings surrounding it having too great a vantage points, not a good design imo. Although it was a more enjoyable affair with other game types 5/10

* **Rundown** - a map not suited to many game types, B dom was a killzone, and FFA was a boosters paradise. It could have been massively improved with romoval of one eighth of its overall area getting rid of the garage and the back house. Not a fun map, too stand offish over the bridge heads, without much relief - 5/10

* **Rust**- like shipment only shit. Mainly due to the towering obstruction in the centre being too overwhelming, fundamental map design failure 2/10

* **Scrapyard** - standard map four perimeter buildings and small complex in centre, good for some game modes, terrible for others, nothing special 5/10

* **Terminal** - I'm sure everyone that played this agrees, it's a map of beauty, such an awesome setting, and a good blend of gun fight scenarios makes this my favourite and probably that of many others 10/10

* **Underpass** - meh see Invasion, yet rainy and depressing 5/10
  
* **Wasteland** - one of the most hot/cold maps ever, when doing well you love it when doing poorly you hate it. Such large sight lines, yet segmented with the cluster fuck centre. It was certainly interesting, if like me you figured out how to do well with a scar for example, you could make an entire lobby your collective bitch on this map. I'll give it a high rating for innovation, and unique layout, with realistic battleground feel 8/10

* **Sub Base** - standard affair, good for objective games, ruined by tac insertion boosting on FFA but so were many other maps, not much to say. Although it did provide building areas that managed not to create one superior location to camp in, so technically its design must be rather good. 7/10

* **Skidrow** - an excellent all round map, long corridors with vantage points made for interesting team based stand offs, leading to eventual flanking and rape, my personal favourite from this game, due to a clutch I once had in SnD ""this one time I had a clutch..."" 8/10

-----------------------------------------

**BlOps**


* **Array** – urghghgghgghhhhhhh, since I’ve actually gotten good at this map, I no longer wish cancerous aids upon its designer, perhaps just a violent cough. It’s piss poor map design in my opinion. The round house is far, far too dominant. Saying that: since I now control that house, without fail, I can confidently get a randy savage K/D on it. But do I have fun doing this? No. I’ll give it a 4 because in some game types it redeems it self; and reminds me of the fourth layer from Inception, and that is a good film... 4/10

* **Cracked** - Standard CoD grid affair, by grid let me clarify, that I mean a 3 by 3 sequential building situation, as seen in every CoD since the good old pre sprinting CoDs. 5/10

* **Crisis** - a grower, you immediately despise it because of its diarrhoea like textures; and your intital insistence on fighting in the concrete underbelly. Big mistake, fight for top control of sand bags and the house, and you’ll start to warm to this map, not a bad map by any means. The amount of secret jump short cuts, makes it a good objective map also. 7/10 

* **Firing Range** - Imo a brilliant map, without boasting or quoting my stats. I can tell you that (boasts about stats*) I am a gang of well hung gang rapists on this map. If you aren’t; I highly suggest the second floor of the side house, with a motion sensor a flak jacket and a chopper gunner, it’s the only map I camp in, much hate mail!  The actual design I feel is pretty solid, it manages to be a tiny map, yet have complex layers and routes, due to a clever use of a cliff and an invisible wall by the ‘ravine’. Splitting the map in two. Ever seen it not voted for? Exactly 9/10

* **Grid** – not a fan really, it’s a roughly symmetrical map, but with one building's second floor being utterly superior to the other's. This leads to, far too much fighting for this one building. Not a fan. 4/10

* **Hanoi** - uruggghghg nauseatingly bad map, its irregular symmetry, or lack thereof; and overly campy construction, ensure you won’t enjoy it. I actually spend time just looking at the gallows in one of its two centres hoping to end it all. 2/10

* **Havana** - excellent all round map, a perfect CoD affair, with an overall s shape, harking back to Crossfire. How can you not like it? Only misses out on being a 10, due lack of innovation 8/10

* **Jungle** – innovative scenario and layout, but with the usual three main routes. All routes have their own segmented compartmentalised firing zones making it full of enjoyable little skirmishes. Its good for close quarters and long range, I believe the only reason it isn’t a 10 is because it’s utterly unconvincing as a jungle, and an excellent example of Treyarch’s poor graphics textures 9/10

* **Launch** - great all round map very similar to Ambush in CoD4 in that the centre ground is higher than the two spawn sides, with a simlar mesh of interlocking cover points over on each side. Not a bad map by any means, although the Soyez rocket area is a little under ulitlised in death match modes. Leading to lob-sided fighting.  7/10

* **Nuketown** – underachieving son of Shipment, a good little map, if you’re in an organised team that understand the idea of not flipping a spawn it can be enjoyable; and FFA spawn traps are ^_^ delicious… for me mwhahaha. Fast and frenzied like fucking on cocaine 8/10

* **Radiation** - a great map, seriously its average, but a door, that you can open and close making objectives harder to take? with opposing switches, why hasn’t this been done before? Genius stuff. It’d be good to average otherwise, but I’ll give this a solid 9/10

* **Summit** – Brilliant map, ruined by spawn issues. I always think its array in the lobby for some reason then am pleasantly surprised when it comes up. It has balanced spawn areas, in terms of cover etc, with interesting fire fights in the centre, with just the right amount of cover causing a two levelled battle ground. Not too shabby 7/10

* **Villa** – Not the best map I’ve ever seen…. I believe it rewards a camping mentality, especially in big team modes, too many choke points overwatched from windows, with not enough routes to the camping areas. For example the window above ‘bar’ with only one staircase up to it. Or the massive balcony with only two door ways. C- must try harder 5/10 

* **WMD** – people seem to love this map, although I’ve yet to find a way to enjoy it, it seems too constipated, if that makes any sense, I get frustrated on it and lose my team too easily and end up being multi-fucked. I’m sure many others like it, however, based on  my friends and this subreddit, so I’ll faithfully give it a 6/10

------------------------------------------------------

**Results:**

MW2 16 maps, 98/160, average score 6.1

BlOps 14 maps, 90/140, average score 6.43

**Conclusion:** I need either a girlfriend, or to start studying. 
Haha no..

In conclusion, maps of either game are of a very similar quality, with levels displaying similar patterns of design.  The occasional innovative variation crops up, which can lead to interesting maps like Jungle or travesties like Hanoi.

It’s the gameplay of either game that make the difference if you played with the damage and gun recoil of MW2 on BlOps maps you’d have an entirely different experience. Be that to your personal preference or not.

I planted the bomb, instead of defending it, they hid for their killstreaks. One of them got a Napalm Strike, but called it in the middle of the map instead of the bomb, in which he obtained no kills. The other team however, were running supportive killstreaks and actually attacking/defending objectives. I know I could just get a proper team going, but not many of my friends play this anymore, let alone have it anymore.
