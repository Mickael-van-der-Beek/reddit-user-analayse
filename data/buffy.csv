I'll be at San Diego Comic-Con hosting a Buffy panel on Sunday 7/15 and my current project is a new site I've launched http://www.geeknation.com - Really looking forward to talking to you all!


EDIT: I happen to have a cool Buffy autographed poster and I'd like to randomly give it away to one lucky fan who has participated in my AMA. http://i.imgur.com/QI1AU.jpg So after the chat is over I'll randomly pick someone and send you a private message. I also have some headshots which I'm happy to autograph, and GeekNation stickers that I can send to others. 


EDIT: Thank you so much! I had so much fun. It's noon and I have to do some work on my website now, but will try to come back and answer more questions later. You have made me feel very welcome on /r/buffy and reddit and I just want to thank you for making this such a positive experience. Hopefully we can do it again sometime!


EDIT: Okay so I closed my eyes and scrolled up and down the AMA page from yesterday and then randomly stopped and pointed at http://www.reddit.com/user/dampierp who is going to win the autographed poster I mentioned yesterday http://i.imgur.com/QI1AU.jpg . I have more prizes for more people though so if you didn't win just sit tight. I'll be picking more people to win more fun stuff. oxox Clare

Here are her comments:,entrechat-million,178,14,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/1240ll/my_little_sister_just_started_watching_buffy_for/,"I am 8 years older than she is, so when I was watching Buffy for the first time when it was on TV every Tuesday, she was too little. Although I have been a huge fan forever, she had never seen a full episode until the other day. Now I can hear her laughing at Xander's jokes from the other room and it just fills my heart with joy! I can't wait until she gets to the later seasons so I can nerd out with her about it more. 

Anyway, here are her comments and questions so far (I've been really trying NOT to give things away for her!):

""Giles is so funny and English.""

""Does Cordelia become part of the gang? I feel like she's going to become part of the gang. Otherwise there's no way they would focus so much on such a bitchy character.""

""Buffy is amazing. She is such a badass!""

""I hate her mom. Do you ever start to like her mom more?"" (BRB WEEPING at not being able to answer this!!!!!)

""I just have this sneaking suspicion that Xander and Willow aren't going to get together."" 

When I asked who her favorite character was so far, she said, ""Probably Willow. Does she stay on the show forever and become super-beautiful and important?"" 

""I can just imagine the love triangles that are going to happen on this show.""

""I don't understand these outfits."" 

""Oh God I already care so much about these people!"" 

""Grr! Arrrgggghhh!"" (said to me this morning as she snuck up on me while I was putting waffles into the toaster.)

We should put together a fan version along the lines of [Star Wars Uncut](http://www.starwarsuncut.com/newhope)! Basically split up the episode into 30 second to one minute clips, reenact them, and compile into pure baddassery.  Would anybody else be interested in claiming some scenes? Come on, you know you want to sing The ~~mustard song~~Dry Cleaning Song with your friends.

My personal favourite quote:

This wouldn’t be complete without Anya’s emotional monologue and this is the point where I lose it.
&gt;**Anya**: But I don't understand! I don't understand how this all happens. How we go through this. I mean, I knew her, and then she's, there's just a body, and I don't understand why she just can't get back in it and not be dead anymore! It's stupid! It's mortal and stupid! And, and Xander's crying and not talking, and, and I was having fruit punch, and I thought, well Joyce will never have any more fruit punch, ever, and she'll never have eggs, or yawn or brush her hair, not ever, and no one will explain to me why. (She puts her hand over her face, crying.)


***

Interesting trivia:


**In the scene where Xander punched his hand through the wall, only a shot of Willow's left eye is shown. This is because actress Alyson Hannigan had experienced an allergic reaction to the dust from the plaster on the wall - a reaction that resulted in her right eye swelling badly. Because of this, she had to go to the hospital the next day to get her eye treated.**


**The body is unique for a Buffy episode in that it features no incidental music. 
""The lack of music, the no cutting, every act in one scene... it was all supposed to be relentless, almost a kind of boredom to create what I wanted to capture,"" Joss told us.**

Jonathan is a suspect and so Willow goes up to him and says, ""Fantasies are fun, aren't the Jonathan? We all have fantasies where we're powerful and respected. Where people pay attention to us. But sometime the fantasy isn't enough, is it Jonathan? Sometimes we have to make it so people don't ignore us. Make them pay attention.""

The event was being held as a way to raise money for Eliza Dusku's charity THRIVE GULU, and somehow, she was able to get her buddy Joss Whedon involved.

My sister and I, already slightly buzzed, arrived at the bar shortly before the two entered. They answered questions about a number of wonderful Joss topics, what it was like filming Much Ado About Nothing (which is finally making it's premiere at Toronto film festival), the status of Doctor Horrible 2 and more awesomeness.

I asked him, in reference to the Avengers, how he found the balance between ""the wonderful Joss writing and being true to the comics?"" He was very sweet and humble, saying ""If I cant hide at least a little as a writer than im not that good."" Very thoughtful and cool!

A few minutes later, my sister and I went over to take pictures with them, and and I got right in next to Joss and he said, ""Sorry if I was kinda mean about your question."" To which I said, ""Oh no, it was great."" After the pic, and in my ridiculous slightly buzzed and overwhelmed state, I said to him, Thanks so much for giving quirky, nerdy girls....and people...a place."" To which he replied, I just love nerdy, quirky girls.""

Before we left, my sister ran over to him and said, ""my little sister came all the way from Texas."" Instead of reacting with a ""oh that's sweet"", or a simple ""aww"", he said, ""Ok, give me some sugar""........and gave me a big hug! It was one of the best moments of my life!

I thought ""huh, I wonder if Joss has killed enough characters to make one solely in the Whedonverse..."" sure enough, he has! Some are super obscure, but he has! I thought some of you might get a kick out of it. Spoilers for all Whedon shows, as well as the Buffyverse comics and Fray. Meant to go with pictures, but reddit won't let me


The Gorey Whedon Alphabet:

A is for Anya, who got herself sliced
B is for Buffy, the girl that died twice
C is for Cordy, who just slipped away
D is for Derrial, who still had things to say
E is for Eve, crushed when the roof fell
F is for Fred, left as only a shell
G is for Giles, his neck snapped by Twilight
H is for Harmony, who got turned by Spike
I is for Izzy, whom Illyria slew
J is for Joyce, there's nothing they could do
K is for Kendra, whose throat bled a lot
L is for Lindsey, reluctantly shot
M is for Mellie, shot herself in the head
N is for Nikki, fought with Spike, wound up dead
O is for Orlando, stabbed by his brother
P is for Penny, killed by someone who loved her
Q is for Quentin, blown to bits overseas
R is for Rance, who was shot on his knees
S is for Spike, who saved everyone
T is for Tara, done in by a gun
U is for Urkonn, who was stabbed for revenge
V is for Veruca, mauled by Oz for a friend
W is for Wash, a spike through him was hurled
X is for Xander, in an alternate world
Y is for Yamanh, who fell after pride
Z is for Zachary, burned from the inside

They reveal so much. Just wondering which quotes you guys felt were particularly heartbreaking or poignant when the characters uttered them in desperation/reflection?

One of my favorites is while Willow is Dark willow (after taras death and during her rampage to kill warren and the others) and Buffy confronts her she utters this one:

**Buffy**: You have to listen to me. The forces inside you are incredibly powerful. They're strong, but you're stronger. You have to remember you're still Willow.

**Willow Rosenberg**: Let me tell you something about Willow. She's a loser, and she always has been. People picked on Willow in junior high school, high school, up until college with her stupid mousy ways. And now... Willow's a junkie. The only thing Willow was ever good for... the only thing I had going for me... were the moments, just moments, when Tara would look at me and I was wonderful. And that will never happen again.

A few weeks ago I rewatched The Chosen Collection extras DVD. One extra was a long interview with Joss, writers, and some crew. At one point Joss is discussing Nicholas Brendon's audition, and he wasn't sure that he'd nailed the reading. But after his lines were read, he said, ""I could really go for some shawarma... is anybody up for some shawarma?"" It was then that Joss knew Nicholas understood funny words.

Anyway, fast forward to this past weekend when I *finally* got to see The Avengers, and there is a part when Iron Man ""comes to"" after being knocked out and says, ""Have you ever tried shawarma? There's a shawarma joint about two blocks from here...""

Maybe it was just a coincidental funny word that worked, but I wonder what made Joss add that. ",,False,self,t5_2sd68,False,,,True,t3_uozey,http://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/uozey/something_familiar_in_the_avengers/,

Sure, there are some later episodes I really liked - but only a few. This is probably because I feel the character Buffy is best suited at high school rather than college. 

I really liked how the enemies and problems Buffy would face would all connect to real problems a typical high schooler would face. I also liked all the ideas the writers came up with while she was at Sunnydale High more than the ones at the college and later series. Once she hit college, I started to feel myself draw less addicted to series. 

But hands down, I feel Season 1 was my absolute favorite. I have no problems with its low funded CGI. I just wish they were able to keep her in high school longer. Don't get me wrong - I still liked plenty of the later episodes and Buffy is one of my favorite series!

Because [they were only sophomores](http://images1.fanpop.com/images/image_uploads/Buffy-Willow-season-1-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-1266073_339_516.jpg).

But then Buffy goes and wears [this beautiful dress](http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100226164411/buffy/images/5/5e/BuffyMaster.jpg), which makes me think that she understands pretty fashion. Everyone – even the Master – compliments how beautiful her dress is.

I guess all the Scoobies were shocked [by something you wouldn't see on *Saved by the Bell!*](http://getbuffysstyle.webs.com/buffy-season1.jpg)

Cordelia sometimes offered [a vintage-chic respite](http://images4.fanpop.com/image/photos/20500000/Out-of-Mind-Out-of-Sight-cordelia-chase-20584274-1160-870.jpg)...

Though she did sometimes [make a good citizen call.](http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/6600000/Cordelia-stands-up-for-Xander-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-6633755-1124-842.jpg) Like about [Xander](http://www.pinkraygun.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/spike-xander-laundry.jpg).

And [Xander again](http://s423.photobucket.com/user/Helmi_87/media/Buffy2/Becoming/s2e21-Xander_Cordelia.jpg.html).

But he never learned how to [change his shirt](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_loccpobC081qbi6cdo1_400.jpg), did he?

Thankfully, things [changed a bit for the Scoobies](http://a142.idata.over-blog.com/350x262/4/62/32/93/buffy-college-2.jpg) during college.

I haven't really heard from Kristine about her time on Buffy (or anything else for that matter), she hasn't done a huge amount of interviews and doesn't seem to attend Cons/events very often (which is fine) but given that she was a pretty integral part of the show I still would like to hear her thoughts, so I've decided to gather as many interviews as I can all in one place in case there are others like me who would like to hear what she has to say. So without further ado:

* [This one was done around the time they were shooting S05E05](http://www.buffyguide.com/players/int_kristine.shtml)

* [Live online chat January 10th 2002 (text version)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/interviews/sutherland/printpage.html). The audio is [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/interviews/sutherland_clips/clip8.shtml) but you need to download Realplayer to hear it.

* [November 9 2002](http://www.baboards.com/forums/showthread.php?t=11468)

* [A previously unpublished interview posted in 2011](http://scifiandtvtalk.typepad.com/scifiandtvtalk/2011/01/buffy-the-vampire-slayers-kristine-sutherland-parental-guidance.html)

* She's also in [this interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy_3ZD-WIzs) with some of the other cast (at the end).

* And [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgfKUDmL_2s) is some footage of her at a European event (apparently) in 2003. She's at about the 7:40 mark.

Post any other interviews you can find too.

I am currently doing research for my Master's Thesis, specifically on the success (or lack thereof) of transmedia pop culture products. I am using Buffy as my primary case study, seeing as it has had a long ""afterlife"", so to speak, moving from film to TV series to spin-off to comics, video games, books, fanfiction, etc.

I would be *extremely* grateful if you would take a few minutes of your time to fill out this survey for me about your experiences with such Buffy productions. If you could forward it on to others (fans as well as people still in the dark) too, that would be fantastic! It isn't too long; there is one question where I ask you to supply as best you can purchase prices/dates that might take a little bit more thought and time (and would also be extremely helpful for my research), but the rest are fairly simple and straightforward.

Anyway, [here's the link](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HMVSCCH).

I'm near the end of Buffy. I've been coming into /r/buffy since about season 3.

I have spoiled many, many things for myself because of this. And that is **my** fault. And I'm okay with that.

Buffy is a very old show. The time for being careful of spoilers is over.

When I make a post, I state where I'm up to in the series, and assume that people will be respectful of that, and not tell me about spoilers. Any other place in this subreddit should spoiler happy.

I'm not sure what should happen regarding the comic books, as they are still going, but that is very different to the show. The show and the comic books are on different levels. Everyone here watches the show. The people who follow the comic books as religiously are a minority.

Just before I finish, I'd like to point out where the mods are breaking their own rules. The trophy case in the sidebar is a really cute part of this subreddit, however, it spoils the major story arc of **every single season!** Even the super recent Season 8, which is as recent as last year! And that is absolutely the kind of thing you want to be avoiding, if you care about spoilers.

When deciding what to post, you should assume everyone has seen *all* of Buffy, unless stated otherwise - just like this post. In a post like this, there shouldn't be any, any, any, **any** spoilers, even with spoiler tags, beyond the latest episode seen my OP.

 Well today, I was sat in my garden and heard something so familiar that I got goosebumps. I jumped up and shouted ""THAT'S BUFFY"". It was the opening sequence. I'll never forget that intro. 

Suddenly every memory I have of Buffy came flooding through me, I even remember things I was doing, what my room looked like when I was watching THAT specific episode. It was amazing. I hope to find the time soon to sit down and rewatch the entire series.

I've never noticed until I re-watched, that Lily's (whom also had other aliases) story continued in Angel. I always felt sorry for her character and wondered what happened to her.

If you don't remember, the first time we saw her, she was  [Chanterelle](http://i.imgur.com/EfzCtY5.jpg) in Buffy season 2 (Lie to Me) as a vampire worshiper at a gothic nightclub. Then, in Season 3 of Buffy (Anne), she had moved to LA, changed her name to [Lily](http://i.imgur.com/3xsMgdi.jpg) and recognized Buffy when she was working at the diner. Buffy saves her from being turned into a slave. She then takes over Buffys apartment and takes the name Anne from her. Then we don't hear from her anymore in the show because Buffy leaves LA and goes back to Sunnydale.

(warning, spoilers ahead for Angel episodes 12 and 14 of season 2.)

In Angel, we meet Anne again as she became [a social worker and the director of the East Hills Teen Center](http://i.imgur.com/uLsxEUO.png) in LA. She is working to help runaways find a better life for themselves just like she had tried to do for herself in Buffy. Angel saves her and she ends up with a boatload of money to help the shelter. 

They continued this story without mentioning that Anne had been helped by both Angel and Buffy a few times in her life. I love that, I feel like it connects the show without making it obvious and that Buffy and Angel were working towards the same common good.

I'm in my late twenties now, and a big fan of Whedon's other stuff (Firefly, Doc Horrible, Dollhouse etc) and attempting to write my own scripts so I decided a couple of weeks ago to say ""fuck it"" and watch a few episodes.

I'd been warned that it took a bit to get rolling but was worth it, I must admit I was extremely skeptical. Frankly I wasn't much into it for a while, thought some of the dialogue, fighting, and shorter story arcs were shit but I kept with it for 90's nostalgia (the music was pretty kick ass from the start IMO). After watching ALL of it, I'm glad I stuck with it.

I'm deeply impressed at some of the shocking moments of sadness and laughter the show managed to evoke. I definitely think a few of the episodes were genuinely scary even with the relatively low production value and special effects of big shows today. I can't help but wonder what this show could have looked like today, on an HBO or Showtime or what have you.

I loved recognizing actors from other Whedon shows I'd seen. Upon finishing Buffy I decided to give Angel a try and it was also awesome to see characters moving between the shows. It makes me wish a lot more shows were like this, united in the same universe with some crossover like you'd see in a comic book. 


Some questions:

1. I know the show isn't THAT old, but it still makes me wonder if it evoked any controversy on its original run content wise? I'm guessing it was on a regular network, but had some pretty mature and potentially controversial moments for non-cable.

2. Besides Whedon's other works, can you all suggest anything else that reminded you of this show, or you think was influenced by it?

My two best friends and I are among the world's biggest Buffy fans. About 8 years ago, we decided to all get the ""Chocolate"" posters from Buffy and Willow's dorm room (Season 4) to display in our own homes. This proved to be extremely difficult. It was out of print! You couldn't find it anywhere. I think once we saw it on Ebay for a hefty price which we couldn't fulfill. 

Then one day, when I was in culinary school (biggest and most expensive mistake of my life- a story for another day and another subreddit) I SAW IT. It was displayed in the school bookstore. I was shocked and ecstatic that I'd found it just by chance! But, alas, it was not for sale. It was owned by the school and was just for display. I inquired repeatedly about buying the poster, but was never given a serious reply. Eventually, the bookstore changed locations, and I never saw the poster again. :(

I've recently become financially comfortable and decided that since this may be the only time I'd ever have disposable income, that I'd search for 3 posters, one for me and each of my best friends, no matter the cost... within reason. But it was the same thing. No internet search lead me to the sale of the poster.  I contacted the original publisher of the poster, the print company, some other sources... nothing. It had vanished. Then...

I thought to my self, ""Self, why not just ask the artist herself if she knows where I could get ~~one~~ three?"" And that's what I did. I emailed her, and she was very nice. She told me she was flattered by my enthusiasm, and that she'd sell me 3 at $20 a piece. I was flabbergasted. I sent her a check in the mail, the old fashioned way, hoping this would be an honest transaction. IT WAS. A week or so later, 3 mint condition Chocolate Buffy posters arrived! 

I gave my two best friends their posters for Christmas along with some Sunnydale sweatshirts that I found on Ebay. Have you ever seen a grown 220 lb man fall to the floor, crippled with emotion? I have, and it was glorious. 

So here is a picture. http://imgur.com/a/m7qrS

I hope the artist doesn't mind me sharing this story. I don't know if she'd appreciate getting bombarded with poster requests or not. :/ The worst that could happen is that she'd say ""no!""

I just wanted to share my joy with you.

In case anybody didn't know, Cecily is the woman that William was in love with, before he became vampire Spike. Halfrek is Anya's vengeance demon friend who gave Dawn her wish for people to stay with her, and also came to Anya's wedding. They are played by the same actress and it's generally accepted that they are probably the same character under different guises.

From the Wikipedia page:

&gt;In the season 6 episode ""Older and Far Away"", Halfrek recognizes Spike and calls him by his human name, William. Spike also recognizes Halfrek, but when asked to explain this they both sheepishly deny being acquainted. This implies that Halfrek had previously been Cecily. However, Halfrek and Anya witnessed the Crimean War (circa 1853) which is mentioned in ""Lessons"" and shown in ""Selfless"". The timing of this event would indicate that Halfrek existed as a demon at least three decades prior to the adoption of youthful human form in Cecily. 

With regards to whether this is canon or not:
&gt;Joss Whedon and Kali Rocha have both made statements that Halfrek and Cecily were indeed the same entity.**[citation needed]**

It's entirely possible for Cecily to have been alive as a demon long before William was born, and she came into town and met him when they were both young adults - I'm not aware of anything that says they knew each other as children or teenagers, and secondly it's been pointed out that the writers wouldn't have written in her recognising him if she wasn't also Cecily.

However, when looking into the character connection I stumbled upon a blog post which addressed the deeper implications of their season 6 meeting, with respect to Spike's entire character and undeath:

&gt;What's interesting is that I think the writers really screwed some things up with this. They made Cecily and Halfrek the same character, but they were never willing to explore the repercussions of this. In the meta I linked to, the author talks about the lost opportunity here, and that in actuality having Halfrek as Cecily retcons some important things. The meta author, for example, makes the point that in establishing Halfrek as Cecily, it completely changes the context of her rejection of William in 'Fool For Love'. If the writers really explored this, it could've been brilliant in regard to Spike's character arc:

&gt;This is some of the best philosophical shit they could have thrown at us. This pulls the rug out from under Spike's arc so profoundly in a way that really comments -- brilliantly -- on the way he builds and rebuilds himself constantly in opposition to the solipsized muses he creates out of objectified women. Cecily literally wasn't real. The fact that Halfrek and Spike never have a conversation in the entire run of the series is among the most profound missed opportunities around, and there are plenty of those in the later seasons.

Halfrek greets William like an old fond friend, rather than being stunned at suddenly meeting the boy who was chasing after her over a hundred years ago. There's definitely something not quite right about that, how could she have forgotten that she stamped on his feelings and rejected him, and greet him so warmly?

What would happen to Spike as a person if he was able to confront her about his past and address some of the issues he's been carrying around?

Does anyone else think this could have been a serious issue for the characters which was strangely brushed over by the writers? ",,False,self,t5_2sd68,False,,,True,t3_182nmk,http://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/182nmk/cecily_halfrek_and_william_a_deeper_meaning/,

as said in the title I'm currently re-watching Buffy (done it before, so you can spoiler the shit out of me) and I now reached S05, the Dawn season. Since I wasn't watching Buffy when it first aired, how was the reaction of the fans (aka you) when Dawn was first introduced? 

Pretending that she always was here is a plot device many TV shows used before and most of the time it's done bad. Did you originally think that's the case here or was it quite common knowledge that it has to have a ""mystic"" reason? Was she loved, hated or ignored by the fans? Did you think it was a good move or did you think it's a cheap trick to add another character? 

So many questions... Let's discuss initially annoying Dawn from the point of view from someone who doesn't know her future and reason!

Edit: Gnarf, using the search a similar thread about her was [posted last month](http://www.reddit.com/r/buffy/comments/10yyg8/i_want_you_to_be_brutally_honest_about_dawn/)...

Someone was asking if Willow ever told Oz or Tara that she loved them. Well... I could definitely think of a few times she said she loved Tara:

**Family** - While they're dancing ""It makes me love you more.""

**The Body** - She mouths ""I love you""

**Tough Love** - ""You're the only woman I ever loved so how could you take me seriously?""
 
**Tabula Rasa** - ""I love you, baby."" I hate her in that moment but still.

Also in **Tough Love** while kinda fighting with Buffy she spits out ""When it's someone you love as much as I love Tara?""

**New Moon Rising** -

&gt;Tara: No, I-I understand. You have to be with the person you l-love.
&gt;
Willow: [smiles] I am.

Now, I can't think of a single moment where Willow herself said she loved Oz. Only one person in that thread could come up with a moment where she said she loved him and that was this speech from the Initiative:

&gt;OK, say that I help, and you start a conversation. It goes great. You like Buffy, she likes you. You spend time together, feelings grow deeper, and one day, without even realizing it, you find you're *in love*. Time stops, And it feels like the whole world's made for you two, and you two alone, until the day one of you leaves and rips the still-beating heart from the other, who's now a broken, hollow, mockery of the human condition. 

But it isn't really a statement that she loved Oz, only that she was in love with him. Which I find is very different. And even then, it's not a direct statement that she was in love with him. Not saying it's any less, necessarily, but very different. If she really never truly said she loved Oz... that's kinda interesting isn't it?
