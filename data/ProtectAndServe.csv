1361124901.0,172,self.ProtectAndServe,18p88j,"I was asked not too long ago ""What makes a good police officer?"" by someone wanting to go into Law Enforcement.",10-13,208,36,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/18p88j/i_was_asked_not_too_long_ago_what_makes_a_good/,"Some good tips are simple: stay in shape, study your law, know your procedure, know what you can and can't do. These are the usual breed of cop in my city.


However, there are a few who go through the academy and all they want to do is be a guy with a badge and a gun. Don't be that guy. Don't get lazy and complacent. Don't go on a power trip just because you can and throw your weight around because you want to see how it feels. There will be a time and a place where you NEED to assert your authority, and that time is only 1 out of every 100 runs you conduct.


1) **Knowledge is complete power with this job.** I pride myself on knowing the laws of my city back and front, knowing proper procedure, and knowing when to let things go even if I don't agree with them. I know that kid has a bag of weed on him... I can smell it. I can see his hands covering his pockets. It's damn obvious... but is it worth it to illegally search him? Does it really matter to me if I write that piece of paper? No. Instead I'll just tell him to mind what he is doing, be more careful, and don't let me catch him doing whatever he was doing again.


2) **Have discretion... don't be a supercop.** Where I work there are over 8 million people residing. There is no need to write every single person. Arrests are different - if someone is breaking a law that is an automatic arrest, do what you have to do and do your job well. 


3) **Treat people with respect**, even those who you have to place in handcuffs. Out of all the people I have arrested, every single one has been treated with the most respect I can possibly give them, unless of course they are doing something that warrants them not respectable (fighting with the police, spitting at us, you get the idea). Do this because you may not remember all of the people you arrest, but they will remember you. When you're out at the park with your family they will see you. You won't see them. Will they attack you because you tortured them for hours before they were sent to bookings? Or will they simply ignore it and keep walking? That choice is yours to make.



4) **Get a hobby.** Your entire life cannot be police work or you will go insane. I play a lot of video games in my free time because it relaxes me and keeps me happy when I need a pickup. If you eat, sleep, and drink police work you're going to burn out quickly and become someone you don't want to be. Which leads me to my next point...


5) **Be yourself and don't change for the worse.** You're going to change... you are going to start being more aware of your surroundings. You will always face the door when you are out eating to see who is coming in and what is going on. You'll always be cautious. It's okay, those aren't bad qualities... but some cops change for the worse in the sense that they alienate themselves from the entire world except other police officers. Most of my friends are the people that I work with, and that is okay, because I can talk to them about stress and problems with the job and they will understand. But sometimes you don't want to talk about work, so I have another set of old friends that I see as well that keep me level.


6) **Don't forget what it was like before you were a cop.** It was scary seeing a police car behind you. It was scary when cops approached you on the street. It scares people. You can be the nicest cop in the world, but you're still going to intimidate people with the uniform. Remember this and act accordingly.


7) **Keep your body and your mind sharp.** Run a few times a week... stay active. Join a baseball league and play on your days off for an hour or two. Just keep yourself in shape and you will be a lot happier on this job. I came on the job horribly out of shape after 4 years of college - beer and wings did it in for me. I started running, dropped 50 pounds, and started taking classes for self-defense and judo in order to hone my fighting skills should I ever need them. A cop who is in tune with his body and mind will be able to perform his job better in the most stressful situations.


8) **Learn to talk to people.** They are people, just like you - not some animals running amok in YOUR city. It isn't yours, you just happen to be there watching over it. You're the superintendent of that area for the day, they are the residents. Let them voice their concerns, and allow yourself to listen. Don't ever think you are better than someone just because you are an officer. If someone is indeed a piece of shit (and you will encounter a LOT of these people) let it be because they are that way that you act the way you do towards them. But if someone is coming to you for help, treat them as a person - not as a statistic.


9) **Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.** If someone needs to be put down because they are causing harm to you or someone else, put them down and put them down hard. You need to be able to switch off politeness sometimes and switch on a stone face capable of getting the job done. If someone is a threat, neutralize that threat. If someone has a gun pointed at you or someone else, pull the trigger. We need to be able to make those hard choices. It isn't easy to live with, but you are the only person who is going to make that choice. You're an officer, not a civilian any more. You're not a hero until you do something heroic. Be brave - when the gunshots go off and everyone is running away, you're the one that has to run towards them. 

10) Finally, my last piece of advice is to **not lose sight as to what your job is.** You're there to protect people. Sometimes that means you will have to hurt another person, and sometimes that means you will have to piss someone off with a ticket, but overall your job is to protect them - even if that means protecting them from themselves. Don't ever think that someone who is calling you for help with their problems doesn't matter, because after responding to the same type of job 1,000,000 times it may not mean much to you - but it is the end of the world for them. Have compassion.

Just be a good person, and you'll be a good officer.",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,,True,t3_18p88j,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/18p88j/i_was_asked_not_too_long_ago_what_makes_a_good/,moderator

I live in a small town with a very large elderly/retired population, and a nearly nonexistent black population. This is important to the story.

So one day, dispatch gets a call from am old lady, complaining that there are ""ni***rs"" using the tennis court in the community center behind her house.... wonderful.

So dispatch tries to explain to the woman that this is not illegal in anyway, and that the civil rights movement did in fact take place. The woman will have none of it, these black people are clearly a menace to the community.

Dispatch agrees to send an Officer to talk to her and asess the situation. SO, dispatch sent the ONLY black officer on the force to go talk to her!

This brave and selfless man died while rescuing a stranded hiker on Mount Charleston in Nevada. To sacrifice yourself for the life of another is the highest possible testament to a mans character. I salute the family of Officer Vanbuskirk.

What these guys do is no less than amazing.
Not only do they specialize in Search &amp; Rescue (mainly for lost or injured hikers in the canyons, mountains and desert around Vegas) but they also assist the SWAT on every mission as ""tactical medics"".

Sadly, all those ""everyday"" heroes don't get the recognition they deserve in today's society, and it takes a tragedy like this for us to realize that they put their lives on the line to save ours or those of our loved ones...

**Rest easy Officer Vanbuskirk, your sacrifice will not be forgotten.**

Do property check on closed park to take a piss; find suspicious vehicle, operator and passenger both have warrants, only get to piss after booking is done.

Take keepers off, take duty belt off, and begin to take dump; Get dispatched to MV crash with PI in your area. 

Help an old lady push her DMV off the road, she tells you what a nice young man you are; call plate in for the log, lady has warrant.


EDIT: Thought of a few more

Spend 45 mins before shift shining boots; assist K9 officer with track through wet lands

Get BOLO on black Honda; every car that passes within the next 30 mins is a black Honda

Spend 4 years in the Marines, Combat tour in Iraq, EAS as a Sergeant; Welcome to the department, boot.

Overall i got good comments from my evaluator.

The part that I'm still not clear on is when we got our debrief, our DT/ACT instructor told us that we were all late on our baton strikes. she noted a particular part of the scenario (the suspect drunkenly threw a beer can on the floor in anger before he got combative) as the green light to start striking. I'll take behavior like that as a hint that there's a good chance I'll have to go hands on with the guy, but I don't think i wanna risk an excessive force situation with something like that.

I walked out to meet the employee inside the fenced parking lot to see what was going on and after talking to him for a few moments outside of his car when he reaches inside his jacket and pulls out a .45 handgun and starts screaming about how the company unjustly fired him and they were ripping him off.

I try to calm him down as much as I can with out aggravating the situation anymore. He stops for a second and looks right at me and pulls the trigger. Thankfully I hear the loudest click I have ever heard in the world as the weapon misfires. I charge forward before he has a chance to chamber another round and fight to clear the weapon away from my body and essentially fighting for my life.

My supervisor see's me fighting with the guy on camera and comes out to help me. Needless to say it's going to change the way I do things from now on and be thankful someone was watching out for me.

One of those weeks where you begin to question why you have this career. I even began looking to other ideas of what I could be doing other than policing. It was definitely one of those weeks. 

However last night reminded me why I'm still out here. Me and three other deputies had sat down for dinner at a local restaurant before starting the shift. The waitress takes our order and walks off. Suddenly replacing our waitress stood a young boy 7-8 years old. In his hand was a piece of cardboard, probably the backing to a large notepad. Both sides of the cardboard were FILLED with signatures. Grinning from ear to ear the boy says ""Can I have your autographs?"" and hands me the cardboard. I'm looking over the cardboard and I'm seeing Sgts, Capts, Lts, Deputies, Police, Agents and on and on and on. 

Signing that cardboard put a grin on my face just as big as the boy's. I passed it to my partners who also added their autographs and handed it back to him. We all talked to him briefly before he said ""Ok I'm going to go so you can eat and then go catch the bad guys"" and he ran back to his mom holding the cardboard out saying ""LOOK LOOK!"". 

We all sat in silence for a few moments when it was the rookie that broke the silence with a simple ""Wow"". As I looked back at the boy who was now standing beside his mom, pointing out our names, it hit me. I don't think I could ever find something that gives me the same joy this career does.

Thanks to our moderators. I could never run this place by myself, and all of them step up BIG TIME around here. Honestly, I couldn't ask for a better bunch of people looking after the place. I have never had to micromanage their decisions, nor have we ever had a problem amongst each other in regards to the subreddit.


I'd also like to thank all of our LEOs that have come here on their free time to speak with everyone. You guys are the backbone of this subreddit, because you give the broad answers that people are looking for. Every department does things differently, and it is so great to see how every situation can be handled in a new way looking through different sides.


A huge huge thanks goes out to all of our regular non-LEO subscribers here as well. The majority of the people here are not law enforcement, but they are the ones that come into the subreddit with interesting questions and opinions - you keep all of us LEOs grounded. It is true that if a cop only hangs out with cops he will only think like a cop. I think it is vital to always remember how it was before we were all on the job.


I also want to thank those of you who really really dislike us. Honestly, I'm always up for a friendly debate - even if I can't change your mind, at least I can see where you are coming from. You don't have to like me or what I do, and I respect that, but most of you come here with an open mind and just want to talk about what is happening in the world of police. That is what this subreddit was made for in the first place: discussion on topics from both sides.



Lastly, I want to say that I never thought this subreddit would gain as much traction as it has. It went from a small group of a few cops and a few questions to a booming sub filled with news, fun, and discussion. I started this sub last year thinking it would probably fail, but Reddit as a whole has been very welcoming.

Hello everyone!

So, in the last days, we had an influx of people from /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut, an anti-police (or at least police-critical) subreddit, when a post of an officer concering citizens filming cops was linked there.

In the wake of this, the mod team has been flooded with reported posts, both of pro-cop and anti-cop posts.

As such, we feel it is necessary to remind everyone of what is considered to be a post worthy of reporting.

Things that are **NOT** to report:

- Posts disagreeing with you. This should be obvious. Just because someone doesn't agree with you, doesn't mean you should report him. It doesn't even mean you should downvote them. Respect other opinions.
- People hurting your feelings. Yeah, people can be mean. But just because someone called you idiot on the internet, you do not need to report him. This is what downvotes are for.

Things that are to report:

- Racism. This should be obvious.
- Posts like ""Fuck you pig, I hope you die!"" ""I hope your family dies!""
- Other sick and weird shit, like that dude posting about wanting to fuck police dogs (&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;)

User jediphobic has made a good point: If you you see something borderline, don't hesitate to report it and the mods will make a decision. **The point of this post is not to discourage you from reporting!**

Unlike what our friends at B_C_N_D want to make you believe, we **DO NOT** remove posts critical of the police. We respect free speech and the right to have an opposing opinion. To prove my point, this is a screenshot of the mod log, from 10 minutes ago. The lowest entry is when the whole shitstorm started.

As you can see, we approve far more reported posts than we delete.

**Examples of deleted posts:**

""You pussy fucking pig. I hope some nigger shoots you through the car door. ""But his tail light was out!!"" yeah... tell it to your next of kin.""

""I didn't say ""black"" I said nigger. There's a huge difference between black men and niggers.
I would hope that nigger got shot waddling his fat ass out of Popeyes.""

""You're almost completely full of shit. I hope Dorner kills as many of you fuckers as possible.""

**Examples of approved posts:**

""Nice police work there Lou, good job justifying killing civillans because you're 'on edge'. I hope they sue the shit out of the LAPD for millions.""

""Also try not to [murder](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/02/07/l-a-police-shoot-two-innocent-people-during-manhunt-for-ex-cop/) innocent people because you think you can get away with it""

After he got all of our personal information through IP tracking and such and then posting it online, he continued to threaten us and tell us he was going to [swat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting) our houses. At this point, we'd been mostly ignoring him and hoping he'd go away.

Eventually, some kid (we'll call him A) who has been in communication with the hacker (we'll call him H) messaged me on Skype telling me that H was going to swat my house that night. So, I put some pants on, brewed a pot of coffee to offer in case the officers came inside, and prepared myself to explain the situation. They arrived with their lights off and parked at the bottom of my rather long driveway, and stayed there a while. I put on all of the house and porch lights and walked to the window and kept waiting. Eventually, I went outside and saw four state police with AR-15s (which was a bit nervewracking). After explaining the situation to them and apologizing that their time was wasted, they asked me for any information I could give on H. 

I only had his Skype username, so I gave them that, but I now have more information thanks to A. Should I give it to them somehow, or just hold on to it (he's done this to people before, but I don't want to waste any more police time with internet nonsense)? 

How can I prevent this from happening again?

What should I do differently is this does happen again? 

Have any of you dealt with this type of thing before? 

Thank you in advance for reading/answering!

1362786893.0,72,self.ProtectAndServe,19xyug,Some meditations about violence and the Police in general,krautcop,86,14,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/19xyug/some_meditations_about_violence_and_the_police_in/,"I was sitting here watching some late night Scrubs (it's 11:15 PM here), while reading ProtectAndServe on the side and I read that post by myekename about being accepted to the Academy. It got me thinking about how she will learn to use physical force in her job and about physical force being used by us as Police Officers in general.

Here in Germany, the ""separation of powers"" is called ""Gewaltenteilung"", meaning the same thing, namely the separation of judicative, executive and legislative powers.

**The word Gewalt has two translations: it means power, but it also means violence.**

We as cops are the executive power. We have power and we use violence. The government has invested in us the power to hurt and even kill people, should it be necessary and the people trust us to use this power responsible. We are supposed to always use our powers for good and only as much as is needed to get the job done, but everyone knows this isn't always the case.

In an ideal world, it would be, but we are all human, which means we sometimes get angry, vengeful, make mistakes and lose control. It is not ideal, but it is the only choice we have. Now, some people might argue that we do not need Police at all and I hope that at some time in the future, when we as a race have grown, they will be right. But that time is not now.

For now, you are stuck with us, for better or worse. In my opinion, for better.

I truly believe that most Police Officers get into this career for the right reasons. That is, to help people. To Protect And Serve, as the Americans would say, in their way of making up catchphrases.

In the Academy, I learned about a concept called (roughly translated) ""The Ladder of Escalation"". It describes how you escalate your actions (if necessary) in a conflict situation step by step, from the first step of talking to someone, until the final step of shooting someone.

This is something I feel more people need to realize: **The Police is not supposed and not trained to react with identical levels of violence. We can always go one step higher on the ladder.**

What I mean by that is, you shove me, I can take you to the ground and handcuff you. If you resist, I can punch you.

If you attack me with your fists, I am not required to engage in a boxing match with you, I can use pepper spray or my baton to gain an advantage.

If you come at me with a knife, I do not need to pull out a knife myself, I can draw my gun.

If you bring a gun, we bring more guns. We bring bigger guns.

You're a big guy? Hell, we'll just bring 5 guys.

Like 10-13 said in another post, we do not fight fair. We fight to win and to arrest.

We are trained to bring a situation under control quickly and with as little harm to others and ourselves as possible. Quickly usually takes precedence, because quick means the guy is handcuffed faster, so that he's no longer a threat (or at least a small one) and possible bystanders are much less likely to intervene. So no, if you see a guy on the ground locking his arms in front of his body and the officer punches him, that is not police violence. That is called a pain compliance technique. I will punch you to make you feel pain, until the pain is so great that you will no longer resist me. There are other, less messy techniques, like pain pressure points (try pressing your index finger into the soft part behind your earllobe, next to your jaw. Hurts, doesn't it?), but they don't work on everyone.

Sure, if the officer can get the dude's arm out from under his body without pain compliance technique, great. But I can tell you, if someone isn't MUCH weaker than you, if he simply locks his arms under his body and holds them, you do not stand a chance in hell to get them out by yourself. If the person is drunk or on drugs, he can seem the like goddamn Hulk.

This is where the number advantage comes into play. If you see multiple officers on one suspect, that is them using proportionate force. With multiple officers, I can arrest the perp quickly and with as little harm to him as possible, because while I might not be able to get his arms on his back by myself, four cops pulling on his arm will do the trick.

One thing the Academy did not prepare me for, is how insanely fast violence happens and how at the same time, it seems to go on forever. I was recently in a situation where we were called to assist EMTs who were being ganged up on by a group of drunk young adults who were not happy with the way they were treating their friend who had dislocated his shoulder somehow.

Me and my partner arrive and there are maybe 8 or more visibly drunk and aggressive people talking angrily to the EMTs and not letting them do their job. We tell them to move back, one guy completely flips out and the rest shift their aggressions to us as well. There was still only the two of us, no backup yet. My partner and I drew our expandable batons, raised them and ordered them to step back.

Suddenly, a guy who has standing to the right of me whom I hadn't even noticed before grabs my expandable baton and tries to take it away from me. I tell him to let go and try to get it back, but he is holding on to it with both hands. I knee him in the stomach and try to get him to the ground, but instead he grabs me in a kind of bear hug around my waist, his hand very close to my gun. I wasn't sure if he was still holding on to my baton at this point and I decided I need to end this quickly. I tell him to let go of me, but he doesn't and I start to punch him in the only place I could reach with his awkward position, his face. I hit him at least 10 times, but he just wouldn't let go. Instead he drops to the ground (on purpose) and drags me down with him. Then my partner turned around (he had been keeping the angry mob at bay) and tries to help me get the guy off of me. He was still holding on to me, then he hit me in the face and I punched him a couple more times, until he finally let go and I got on top of him. He was still on his back and refused to turn on his stomach and put his hands on his back for a bit, but the situation was under control in about 30 seconds, from the point where he grabbed my baton to us sitting on top of him.
Backup arrived about 20 seconds later.

Those were the longest goddamn 50 seconds of my life. If they would put me under oath right there, I would have SWORN it took at least 3 minutes for the backup to arrive, probably more. My partner and I watched CCTV footage of the whole thing later and we were in complete disbelief at how quickly everything happened.

Now, to other people watching this, it must have seemed like a complete overreaction on my part. I mean, he was just holding on to me, right? But as a cop in that situation, it was more than that. I was afraid he was going to grab my gun, I was afraid if I dragged this out any longer, that the other people would decide to help their friend.

It's almost 01:00 AM now and this turned into a much longer rant than I wanted (and it was actually even longer before I deleted about 25%), but what I am trying to say is this:

Non-cops, I know it seems to hard to understand why we use violence sometimes. But remember what I said about ""The Ladder of Escalation"" and that you are watching a video from your comfy chair, being able to zoom in, ENHANCE, replay and analyze every second at your liking and that hindsight is always 20/20.

Yeah, looking at the CCTV footage of my fight, I now know he dropped the baton as soon as he went to grab me and that he never went for my gun or even got close. I now know that backup arrived very fast and that I probably could have just stayed in kind of a locked hold with this guy on the ground until they arrived, but I did not know this at the time and I had to make a decision in about half a second.

Rookie Cops, you will probably end up seeing and inflicting more violence in a month than other people see or inflict in their entire life. Shit will hit the fan in about half a nanosecond, but as soon as it does, seconds will feel like minutes and minutes like hours. Oh and it will be scary. Scary as FUCK. When you are wrestling on the ground with a guy in the dead of night in some backyard and you're hearing the sirens come closer and closer, but no one is coming and you realize they don't know exactly where you are, you'll be just about ready to shit your pants. But they WILL find you and you WILL get through it and you will be thinking ""Hey, that German guy on reddit was right!""

Just remember this: The people of your country are trusting you to use the immense power you wield responsibly and proportionate. As Uncle Ben said, with great power, comes great responsibility. I know you'll be angry and it will be hard to control yourself sometimes, but remember that you are a Police Officer, not some random bar brawler. The people's trust in the Gewaltenteilung is fundamental for a democracy. Honor their trust.

Today I was walking past the home of a Kern County Sheriff. Usually Im scared shitless of them but I walk past this house often. I noticed the officer leaving his home for duty, dressed in full uniform. Naturally I diverted my eyes and kept walking, waiting to hear his foot steps coming down the concrete stairs leading to his squad car parked out on the street.

After a minute when I didn't hear his foot falls, I looked up and there he was still on his porch, turned around and facing his front door. It was closed and he was murmuring to himself, then he quickly crossed himself and kissed his front door. Instantly I knew what I had just witnessed, a prayer for a safe return. I was truly moved.

It made me think about officers of every class and rank, military and civilian. They truly are just working class folks like the rest of us working class folks. It was a reminder to me to always see each one as an individual person no matter what uniform they wear. It truly is a sad profession that separates you from your true peers.

So, we went to a radio run for a husband and wife that were fighting. No injuries, just an domestic argument. After we arrived, both the husband and wife were pretty calm, but the wife was a little more angry than the husband. Apparently, the wife wanted the husband out of the house because they were fighting over one thing or another. We talked to the husband, told him he didn't legally have to leave, but it may be a good idea to find somewhere else to go for the evening to let things settle.


The husband was pretty understanding and said he would stay at his friend's house. No big deal. We did the domestic report for the incident and then left.


Fast forward 2 hours. We get a call back to the same location. When we show up, the wife is in the kitchen crying and holding her eye. The husband was in his room. She said he returned, beat her up a bit, and is now inside the bedroom. We took him out of the bedroom and placed him under arrest with no force - he turned around, we handcuffed, and walked out. We called the ambulance, she didn't want to go to the hospital. Did the reports, dropped him at the precinct with another officer who would process the arrest, and went back out on patrol.


Fast forward again, an hour later.


We show up for a call of 2 men fighting. We get there to a local bar notorious for trouble, and we see 2 guys on the ground fighting it out. We grab them and place one under arrest. The second one turns around and starts fighting the officers there, including me. We put the guy down and placed him under arrest... but who do we see in the crowd watching? The wife from the previous job. She was now standing around with the crowd with her cell phone out yelling ""YOU FUCKING COPS! YOU FUCKING PIGS! WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU! WHY ARE YOU ARRESTING HIM YOU RACIST PIGS!""


I was in shock. I walked up to her, she recognized me, and then asked her ""Why? Just... why? We just helped you tonight... why are you yelling at me?"". She simply pushed the camera in my face and started shouting my name and shield number out. I was bewildered. This is the same woman who just got her eye swollen shut a few hours ago and now she is out with her friends blaming the cops for arresting 2 drunken idiots who decided to tee off on each other in the middle of the sidewalk. The same woman that just called us to help her because she needed us. Now she is standing there treating us like shit for a situation that called for police action.


A wild thought came into my mind as we were on our way back... ""Why am I even trying to help these people?"". I know, it's my job to do it impartially and without bias, but why am I even attempting to help them if all they are going to do is shit on me later? I know why... because it's my job. It's what I was sworn to do, and if I don't take action in those situations, nobody will. Why do I put myself and others at risk driving at high speeds to rush to an assault call, or a robbery, when the next day (or next hour) the same victim that we help will just be there doing everything they can to make us miserable? 


It burns. It really burns. You try your best to do the right thing and you still get shit on at every turn. It isn't a matter of appreciation, but more a matter of common humanity. It just got to me.


I'll still treat every situation with a clean slate, as I should, but I can't help but be enraged at the fact that the same person to call the police for help hours earlier will be screaming at them in the middle of the street like we are demons for doing our job. It boils my blood.

There's a lot of threads published about police-candidates who get discouraged when they get rejection or disqualification letters.  The most common replied comments are advice telling you to stick it through and keep applying.  

In the last three to four years I've applied to well over a dozen police agencies, taken written tests, and so forth. In the last six months I've made it to the oral boards five times, passed and made it to the polygraph three times, and passed twice more for the final chief interview.  Every single time I eventually got the rejection/disqualification letter.  Yes, every time I got the notice I wanted to just quit trying.  However, I want to be a police officer; in the last four years I've attained a CJ degree and have worked for private security/investigation companies attaining massive amounts of good starting experience, even completing an internship with a very respected police agency.  I told myself I wasn't going to quit.  

Finally, on Tuesday, after being told ""no"" for four years and draining my body on polygraphs and interviews only to be rejected afterwards, I finally was offered a position as a police officer.  Why?  I didn't quit.  Being a police officer is something I've dreamed of since I was little.  If you truly want to be a police officer you won't quit, no matter how many doors get slammed in your face.

I'm excited to start and been getting ready as much as I can.  I'm researching threads on here for advice for rookies, what to be prepared for, and equipment to purchase (i.e. tourniquet, quick clot, etc.).  

I just wanted to tell everyone who has been getting told ""no"" like me to push through it only if you have the courage and heart to do so.  I don't have the perfect background, I've admitted to some embarrassing things, and I'm certainly not your typical police officer in stature (I'm actually a pretty small guy).  

My new police agency is pretty strict about internet stuff, so I don't think I can ""verify"" I'm a police officer with the mods as I don't want reprimanded for something so stupid, especially as a rookie.  However, I did get hired in good ole' West Virginia.  

Thank you for all you guys who have posted advice and comments about police work.  It's nice to have a somewhat informal message board to collect information and stories from which to learn.

1370704799.0,59,self.ProtectAndServe,1fxg5c,To hopefuls and future applicants - you may want to rethink a Criminal Justice degree,,80,21,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1fxg5c/to_hopefuls_and_future_applicants_you_may_want_to/,"Listen, I know it seems like makes sense.  You want to be a biologist, you major in biology.  You want to study rocks, you major in geology, you want to be a cop, you major in criminal justice.  Police work is a little different though.

Law enforcement is a very specific set of skills.  For the most part, these skills don't translate to any other profession.  Sure there are a few overlapping areas such as crash investigations and insurance companies, motor carrier safety and shipping companies, etc.  These examples are rather few and far between.  Law enforcement also is rather unique in that you have academies that teach you these specific sets of skills.

Most departments run their own academy, or have a regional academy, that they will send you to once you are hired.  Some still make you go to an academy on your own dime before they hire you, but thats rather rare.  Either way, you're going to spend between 12 and 36 weeks in some sort of specific training environment before you hit the road.  In here in addition to teaching you how to shoot, drive, fight, render first aid, and other cool stuff, you're going to learn the academics of it.  You're going to learn criminal law, traffic code, constitutional law, 4th and 5th amendments, search and seizure, criminal process, court processes, etc.

In a criminal justice program at your university you are going to learn criminal law, traffic code, constitutional law, 4th and 5th amendments, search and seizure, criminal process, etc.

See where I'm going with this?  For cops who want to get a degree because their department requires one for promotion, or just to say they have one, CJ is a great program.  Its generally stuff we already know and have been taught.  A few more specifics here and there, but the bread and butter is what we've been doing for years.  

For a department hiring someone, a CJ degree **generally**  isn't going to look any better than a non - CJ degree.  Either way you are showing that you're someone who has the intelligence, resources, and dedication to spend X years studying a specific skill set.  Some guys every now and then prefer to see a CJ degree, but the cons will outweigh the pros here.

Remember how I said we have a specific skill set?  LEOs get hurt pretty frequently.  Don't be so quick to jump to the statistics about how fishing and construction are more deadly.  They may be, but in our world there are lies, damn lies, and statistics.  Most of the ones I've read on this subject don't take into account attempted murders upon officers, but that's irrelevant to your conversation.  What is relevant is you can be put out of your job without being killed.  

One bad crash, one bad fight, one bad shooting, and you injure your spine, or lose a leg.  You may have been the best cop in the world but if you can't walk without a cane, you can't do this job.  Even without being physically injured, maybe the job is just too much for you one day.  You get worn out of the crappy people, the hurt people, and seeing terrible stuff.  Depression is common among law enforcement, and people burn out relatively quickly.  This is why so many departments offer relatively good retirement, cause you cant do this job forever.

So when you left the department early for whatever reason, and need a new job, how is that CJ degree gonna work out for you?  Yeah it helps to have a degree period, but what I've been getting at in this post is this - have a backup plan.  Get your degree in something you love, or something you can do as a backup.  It may mean the difference in coming out of this job, and hopping into another one you can really enjoy, or not being able to find a decent job at all.  


tl;dr - For applicants, a CJ degree offers little more to a hiring agency than a non-CJ degree.

The scene.  Florida.  I'm working day shift:  6A-6P.  It's about 1730hrs and I get dispatched to a crash, no injuries.  That day had been particularly busy.  I had already done several reports that day and just wanted to go home.  I arrive on scene and see an SUV with minor front end damage and a sedan with minor rear end damage.  The driver of the SUV is out of the car talking with the driver of the sedan.  I'm approaching the vehicles on foot and see a male passenger sitting alone in the front, passenger seat of the SUV.  I ask him if he's OK and if he needs medical attention.  He shakes his head and says no.  I approach to the two drivers and ask them the same.  They both say no.  I begin collecting information from the drivers and then got information from the passengers in the sedan.  The driver of the SUV was being VERY helpful and polite.  He just wanted to finish up and leave.  My first clue.  I go back to the SUV to get the passengers information and he is very quiet, but gave me the information I was asking for.  I go back to the police car to bang out the paperwork.  When I'm finished, I go to the SUV and give the driver his form and I give the passenger my business car and tell him to call the PD if he wants a copy.  I again ask if he's OK or needs medical and he says he fine.  I finish up with them and tell them to have a good one.  I give the people in the sedan their information and forms and tell them to have a good one.  

The next day, I come into work and there's a message for me to call a detective at the Sheriff's office.  It doesn't say what it's regarding.  I get him on the line and he informs me that the SUV that was involved in the crash was under surveillance by the narcotics unit and that it had been being followed by detectives.  They pulled into a nearby boat-ramp across the street and watched the whole exchange.  The first thing the detective did was criticize me for letting my guard down and not following basic officer safety.  He asks me how long I've been a cop for, and I tell him a year.  He tells me that I learned a very valuable lesson, and he was right.  He wasn't being an asshole about it in any way, shape or form, but he was right and I DID learn a good lesson.  He tells me ""Just because you're only handling an accident, you should still be practicing officer safety"" - and he was right.  Now the worst part.  He goes on to tell me that they stopped the SUV on the interstate shortly after and found a large amount of felony narcotics (I believe it was cocaine and ecstacy) and a loaded handgun.  The detective tells me that he tells the 2 suspects that they watched them during the crash investigation.  The front-seat passenger tells the detective that ""if that cop came to the car once more, I was going to smoke him.""  Meaning me.  I was shocked and I was very disappointed in myself for letting that happen.  So, you guys be safe.  It's a long read, but I wanted to post it as a reminder to always keep your guard up.

Thank you for what you do.,Id_rather_be_eating,62,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/176pbi/a_little_over_a_year_ago_an_officer_discovered_my/,"I posted this over in Suicide Watch for obvious reasons. I got a PM requesting I repost it on this subreddit. I just wanted to say thank you for everything you all do and if you're by some random chance the guy I wrote this letter to, again, thanks. I'm living a good life. I have you to thank.

If you're curious, a deputy went for a drive down a random country gravel road at one in the morning and discovered me. Contacted EMS and stayed along until I stablized, taking the time to explain what was happening and working with my family. I cannot thank him enough. 

Officer _______,

My name is Id_rather_be_eating. You met me on the night of Nov. 9 when you pulled up to my car and found me passed out/drugged out of my mind. I hope that kind of scenario is rare enough that it stands out and you remember me. 

I'm writing to say thank you for everything you did that night. I had taken a lot more pills before getting into my car and what you found didn't begin to describe how dangerous it really was. You stumbled on my failed suicide attempt and I can't put into words how thankful I am. There were a number of things going on in my life that led that to that night. I had a relationship end with a girl I moved for after only six months, financial problems, living a fairly lonely existence, and a number of other chronic issues. Everyone thought I was this perfect, smart, funny guy who had no problems and the stress of wearing that mask while hurting inwardly was just too much. Mostly though I was clinically depressed and it had gone untreated for about 15 years. I've since been diagnosed as Bipolar type II. It has the highest suicide rate among all forms of depression. 

Most of that night comes back in flashes and I'm not sure what actually happened and what I imagined. You are very clear presence throughout that memory though. You were professional, compassionate, and from what I remember, the only one I look back on as a calming influence on what was a very anxious twenty-four hours. To be honest, I'm utterly shocked that you found me. You weren't supposed to. I'm glad you did. Since then, I've gone through quite a few changes. I've been properly medicated, I've started therapy, moved away to be near family and a better support system, and finally have some clear and attainable goals for what I want to do with my life. I feel shaken, humbled, and good. 

I have no idea what your life is like. I don't know if you love or hate your job. I don't know if you have a great family life with tons of friends or if you were just as lonely as I was. I just need to let you know you made a real difference and I will be indebted to you for the rest of my life. You were a calming presence for my family when you eventually talked and they wish to say thank you as well. I assume you'll be working in law enforcement for a long, long time and if that's the case, if you forget me among the hundreds of others you help, please just know that way back when you saved a man's life and somewhere, he thinks of you often. I will never forget you. 

Again, thank you.

Before I post what he said, let me give you a little history about my dad. He started his career working as a part-timer at a shore town during college. He then moved on to first the Coast Guard for four years, where he served with the navy on drug interdiction task forces, and then with the DEA for six years. He resigned after they tried to reassign him across the country, and moved back to his hometown, where he's been a cop here for 17 years. He's now a sergeant in patrol. Feel free to add those years up. Anyways, here goes nothing!

1. Love the guys on your shift. This job becomes more about them than anything else. They may not be the best guys in the world, but they have your back 10 times out of 10. A few months back I suffered an on duty injury. Along with my two sons, the guys at work were my main motivation to get my butt in shape and get back out there. They're my cops. None of the other sergeants can have them. They're the best.

2. Remember why you signed up to be a cop. Protect and Serve is written all over our profession. I'm not worried about the protecting part. I have no doubt you guys love to catch bad guys. But remember the serve part most of all. Perform wellness checks on the old people, even when their relatives aren't worried. They love to talk your ear off. Play sports with the teens and buy ice cream for the little kids. If there's a kid who comes up to you saying he wants to be a cop, get a picture with him, take him through the patrol car, make him feel like a cop. This how we can really prevent crime.

3. Give breaks. Be the ""nice"" cop to the people that deserve it. Let them tell their friends about your courtesy and respect. Tell the underage drinkers to dump the booze and have a good night. On the flip side, be harsh. Let the criminals fear you. Let them know you won't tolerate them in YOUR town. And be compassionate to the victims. Hold them when they cry. Give them your card and offer them professional help.

4. Find something else that you love, that keeps you healthy. This is self explanatory. Ever since my injury, I've been on a fast track to being in the best shape of my life since my 20s. I play with my puppy, walk with my wife, swim with one son, and lift weights with his brother.

5. Final thing. Remember, you all can be GREAT cops. You took an oath to be a symbol of something bigger. A system everyone can believe in. Remember what you represent. If you start to slack, you don't take any calls that come out, you start being rough on people, then they won't believe in Law and Order. Liam Neeson said something the first batman, and i have my own twist to it, If you devote yourself to the idea that our justice system works, if you make yourself more than just some dude with a gun and a blue uniform, then you become something bigger. You become a symbol of justice, and a trusted public servant.
Good luck in all of your careers, my brothers and sisters. Stay safe and god bless.

EDIT: He just ran into my room and thought of something else. When you carry casually off duty (just driving/walking around, or at the store.) carry your gun, badge, wallet, flashlight, knife, and a small first aid kit in a tactical bag. Yes, it makes you look like you have a man purse. But it's easier than fumbling around with all those fancy CCW holsters. Yes, I got the idea from Serpico. It works! ;)

1341533736.0,46,self.ProtectAndServe,w3qi6,Someone asked me on tips for becoming a good police officer after the academy. [x-posted from another thread].,10-13,63,17,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/w3qi6/someone_asked_me_on_tips_for_becoming_a_good/,"Some good tips are simple: stay in shape, study your law, know your procedure, know what you can and can't do. These are the usual breed of cop in my city.


However, there are a few who go through the academy and all they want to do is be a guy with a badge and a gun. Don't be that guy. Don't get lazy and complacent. Don't go on a power trip just because you can and throw your weight around because you want to see how it feels. There will be a time and a place where you NEED to assert your authority, and that time is only 1 out of every 100 runs you conduct.


1) **Knowledge is complete power with this job.** I pride myself on knowing the laws of my city back and front, knowing proper procedure, and knowing when to let things go even if I don't agree with them. I know that kid has a bag of weed on him... I can smell it. I can see his hands covering his pockets. It's damn obvious... but is it worth it to illegally search him? Does it really matter to me if I write that piece of paper? No. Instead I'll just tell him to mind what he is doing, be more careful, and don't let me catch him doing whatever he was doing again.


2) **Have discretion... don't be a supercop.** Where I work there are over 8 million people residing. There is no need to write every single person. Arrests are different - if someone is breaking a law that is an automatic arrest, do what you have to do and do your job well. 


3) **Treat people with respect**, even those who you have to place in handcuffs. Out of all the people I have arrested, every single one has been treated with the most respect I can possibly give them, unless of course they are doing something that warrants them not respectable (fighting with the police, spitting at us, you get the idea). Do this because you may not remember all of the people you arrest, but they will remember you. When you're out at the park with your family they will see you. You won't see them. Will they attack you because you tortured them for hours before they were sent to bookings? Or will they simply ignore it and keep walking? That choice is yours to make.



4) **Get a hobby.** Your entire life cannot be police work or you will go insane. I play a lot of video games in my free time because it relaxes me and keeps me happy when I need a pickup. If you eat, sleep, and drink police work you're going to burn out quickly and become someone you don't want to be. Which leads me to my next point...


5) **Be yourself and don't change for the worse.** You're going to change... you are going to start being more aware of your surroundings. You will always face the door when you are out eating to see who is coming in and what is going on. You'll always be cautious. It's okay, those aren't bad qualities... but some cops change for the worse in the sense that they alienate themselves from the entire world except other police officers. Most of my friends are the people that I work with, and that is okay, because I can talk to them about stress and problems with the job and they will understand. But sometimes you don't want to talk about work, so I have another set of old friends that I see as well that keep me level.


6) **Don't forget what it was like before you were a cop.** It was scary seeing a police car behind you. It was scary when cops approached you on the street. It scares people. You can be the nicest cop in the world, but you're still going to intimidate people with the uniform. Remember this and act accordingly.


7) **Keep your body and your mind sharp.** Run a few times a week... stay active. Join a baseball league and play on your days off for an hour or two. Just keep yourself in shape and you will be a lot happier on this job. I came on the job horribly out of shape after 4 years of college - beer and wings did it in for me. I started running, dropped 50 pounds, and started taking classes for self-defense and judo in order to hone my fighting skills should I ever need them. A cop who is in tune with his body and mind will be able to perform his job better in the most stressful situations.


8) **Learn to talk to people.** They are people, just like you - not some animals running amok in YOUR city. It isn't yours, you just happen to be there watching over it. You're the superintendent of that area for the day, they are the residents. Let them voice their concerns, and allow yourself to listen. Don't ever think you are better than someone just because you are an officer. If someone is indeed a piece of shit (and you will encounter a LOT of these people) let it be because they are that way that you act the way you do towards them. But if someone is coming to you for help, treat them as a person - not as a statistic.


9) **Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.** If someone needs to be put down because they are causing harm to you or someone else, put them down and put them down hard. You need to be able to switch off politeness sometimes and switch on a stone face capable of getting the job done. If someone is a threat, neutralize that threat. If someone has a gun pointed at you or someone else, pull the trigger. We need to be able to make those hard choices. It isn't easy to live with, but you are the only person who is going to make that choice. You're an officer, not a civilian any more. You're not a hero until you do something heroic. Be brave - when the gunshots go off and everyone is running away, you're the one that has to run towards them. 

10) Finally, my last piece of advice is to **not lose sight as to what your job is.** You're there to protect people. Sometimes that means you will have to hurt another person, and sometimes that means you will have to piss someone off with a ticket, but overall your job is to protect them - even if that means protecting them from themselves. Don't ever think that someone who is calling you for help with their problems doesn't matter, because after responding to the same type of job 1,000,000 times it may not mean much to you - but it is the end of the world for them. Have compassion.


Just be a good person, and you'll be a good officer.",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,,True,t3_w3qi6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/w3qi6/someone_asked_me_on_tips_for_becoming_a_good/,

You're on foot, usually solo, patrolling project buildings and sketchy neighborhoods. If you're lucky, you have someone on a nearby post to partner up with.


My first day, I was working a night shift from 6pm to 2am. It was cold outside and I wasn't used to the area. I didn't know which way was north, what streets were in the area, or what the hell central was assigning over the radio. It was a solitary feeling I had even though there were a lot of people on the street.


I was out of my comfort zone, out of my element. This wasn't the kind of neighborhood I would be in had I not had a gun on my hip. Lots of drugged out people walking the streets, tons of wannabe gangbangers flagging their colors in front of buildings, and people walking by on the street seemingly sizing me up or flashing looks my way.


So I stool vigilant on my post. I had a mentality about me - a tightened sense of awareness. I played through my academy training and things I would do in certain situations. Fear was a factor being out there.


Then, a child walked up to me. ""Hi, policeman!"" She said with a big smile. I waved back, then she asked me some stuff about my belt and my badge. Kid questions. I was friendly and chatted with her about the handcuffs and the radio, then she waved and left with her mother who.just came out of a store.


It was surprising. There I was, expecting action and adrenaline all day - but not much happened. It grounded my senses. I don't know, something dawned on me that dropped all of my uneducated guesses about what police work was. I wasn't just there to be an enforcer, but to be a part of the community for better or for worse.


The next day was the same up until a robbery came over the radio. I made my way, on foot, to the area and started looking for suspects. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. After the sector met with the complaintant and took him to look for the suspect, a foot pursuit came over the radio a block away. I took off running to get there and ended up assisting the officer in the arrest of the robbery suspect.


After everything was handled, I returned to my post. Nobody walking by knew what just happened.... nobody realized that a gun was just recovered, and nobody was aware of the dangers in the streets that we handled. It shocked me that the man I just helped arrest had a .22 revolver on him and I could have caught a bullet during the struggle.


It opened my eyes. Police work can be night and day. One day you'll be talking with a 4 year old, the next you'll be on a gun run.

The policeman stood and faced his God,
Which must always come to pass.
He hoped his shoes were shining.
Just as brightly as his brass.

""Step forward now, policeman.
How shall I deal with you? 
Have you always turned the other cheek?
To My church have you been true?""

The policeman squared his shoulders and said,
""No, Lord, I guess I ain't,
Because those of us who carry badges
can't always be a saint.

I've had to work most Sundays,
and at times my talk was rough,
and sometimes I've been violent,
Because the streets are awfully tough.

But I never took a penny,
That wasn't mine to keep....
Though I worked a lot of overtime
When the bills got just too steep.

And I never passed a cry for help,
Though at times I shook with fear.
And sometimes, God forgive me,
I've wept unmanly tears.

I know I don't deserve a place
Among the people here.
They never wanted me around
Except to calm their fear.

If you've a place for me here,
Lord, It needn't be so grand.
I never expected or had too much,
But if you don't.....I'll understand.

There was silence all around the throne
Where the saints had often trod.
As the policeman waited quietly,
For the judgment of his God.

""Step forward now, policeman,
You've borne your burdens well.
Come walk a beat on Heaven's streets,
You've done your time in hell.""

I'm sure most if not all of you are aware of chemical suicide and the problems that it poses for us as first responders. However I'll explain it anyway in case anyone is unfamiliar. A person who wishes to commit suicide will mix together some chemicals which will release noxious gases that in a confined space will prove fatal or they may use something like a smokeless barbecue which will release Carbon Monoxide. 

Usually people who do this will leave a note on the door explaining the presence of noxious chemical fumes or there may be a note which simply says ""do not enter, call police/fire service"". As a side note if you do see this do not enter if you are not wearing appropriate protective gear. I'm told that if it is carbon monoxide then the fire service can use their Self contained breathing apparatus to enter but anything else requires a full on CBRN response.  

My main point here is that we have in the UK recently found one instance of a person leaving no warning note at the front door of their house after committing suicide in this manner and also tried to harm officers by leaving an amount of the powered chemical on the doorstep to be mixed with a chemical on the inside of the door. This is believed to be an deliberate attempt to harm police officers. Anything like that, get out, stay out! 

Stay safe out there all. ",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,,True,t3_1bcry7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1bcry7/one_to_watch_for_chemical_suicide/,

I'm told he had the whole thing planned out. Sent an email to his wife, drove out somewhere, and used his service weapon. Nobody can believe he would do this. Not him. He wasn't that type of guy.

So please, if you've got some shit going on in your life, and you think taking yourself out of it is the answer, seek help. Talk to someone. ",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,,True,t3_1k0awj,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1k0awj/a_friend_took_his_own_life_if_you_need_help/,

In less than 2 months I will retire. I had a badge in my heart long before I had one pinned on my chest. This is for cops like me not the ones that it is just a job for. Right now pay is down, some of the public does not support us. It will get better and worse. Do your job and do it well then when you are sitting where I am you can say. ""I made a difference.""  Be proud of what you do. Most of the complainers have not got the balls to do what you do. You put your life on the line so they can sleep well at night and bitch about you in the morning. All the while knowing that you may not make the end of your shift. You may never hear about it, but you will be remembered for being compassionate to a wife who just became a widow. She will hate you but then over time remember that you held her while she grieved and explained to her son why Daddy would not being coming home because she couldn't.  Over 100 times I have told people that someone they love will never come home. I have kissed my wife and kids goodbye not knowing 100% I would be home at the end of my shift. But they stood beside me because they knew that being a cop was who I was. More than anything else I had the time of my life being a State Trooper. Be proud of what you do. Cherish every moment. You will snap your fingers and the kids will be grown and you will be at the end of your career. Cut your wife some slack. There is no way she will ever understand why you do what you do Hug and kiss your kids everyday. Make sure they know that you could not be who you are without them. If you are lucky enough as I have been able to rise in rank, mentor the young cops that work for you that ""get it"".

Here I'll explain a few things, dos, and don'ts, and how to prepare yourself.

Ask yourself how can you help, and why do you want to.
----

If you're looking to become law enforcement to look cool in front of your friends, or gain power through the badge, stop now; reconsider. Police work through holidays, birthdays, special days, for low pay and not even a thank you in many cases. I'll break it to you right here: Many days are boring, and every day is a lot of paper work. Sound exciting?

Here's a reason to join law enforcement: If you have the ability to help stop crime in your community and you really want to.. you should feel morally obligated to do so, legally.

The best way to earn experience before being hired on and put through an academy, is to do ride alongs; and for those under the age of 21, check in on local auxiliary police programs. Aux units are unpaid but earn you a lot of experience. You will help your community, and it is easy, and fun to do while enrolled in college. Not all departments offer these programs, so check with near-by cities. Many police deparments have cut down on funding, so check with Pell Grants or loan options to put yourself through an academy at a college or university. You will be reimbursed upon hiring. (Make sure that you are).


The dos:
----

Stay drug free. and physically fit. It's a moral obligation to yourself, and if you can discipline yourself to stay clean, out of trouble, and be healthy, you'll make it through the academy, and it can help save yours and others' lives when you're hired and on duty.

Keep your personal problems to your friends and family, outside of work. You'd be surprised how much you say can come and bite you in the ass later. 


Know your laws. Many states have revised coded (Like Ohio Revised code) that cities are adopting. Look in to it.

Traffic laws, gun laws, drug laws, and domestic disturbance laws. Knowing these laws will help you, as you progress through the academy, it's easier to remember when they're things you've already learned.

Train your memory: when you walk in to someone's house, remember descriptions of people, how many people are there, what they're wearing, smells, small details that most people would overlook. This will help you when you become an officer, as you've already trained yourself to do it.


Do nots:
----

Do not involve yourself with 'friends' or others that involve themselves in illegal activity. Stay away from drug dealers, thieves (it's amazing how many people are kleptomaniacs).

Follow the traffic laws, never drive drunk. Stay off of drugs unless you're prescribed.

Never lie. Even if the truth hurts.

Never lie about being a police officer. Even if you are in the academy or want to be one. This is illegal, and disrespectful to the profession.


Do not expect things to be done for you. If you are a man or a woman looking to represent your community, you need to go full-force in to doing things yourself. Force yourself to do things that you normally wouldn't.



These are things off of the top of my head, but for those looking to get involved, feel free to post, and join us on IRC (link is at the top)",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,mp,True,t3_17e3ck,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/17e3ck/looking_to_become_a_leo/,moderator

""Hi,

I am a veteran who has struggled to adjust with anxiety and PTSD since being honorably discharged from the United States Marine Corps active duty in XXXX. It was hard to get my life back on a positive track, but I did. 

On XXX street in xxxx around xxxx pm x/xx/xx I made an error in judgement and turned into another car for a minor fender bender. I was already a mess since my xxx(family member) died the day prior. 

We stopped in a nearby parking lot to exchange information. I had no idea the adrenaline rush from the surprise impact would bring back a panic attack which i haven't had in years. The nice lady whom I hit called the police as I probably looked extremely shady and skittish. Two cruisers showed up, I never even thought about why two showed up and not one. I am assuming she let the dispatcher know how distraught I looked.

I don't remember their names, the two gentlemen. The officers immediately put things at ease, and acted with the utmost professionalism in realizing what was going on in the situation. They treated me with respect and were in no way confrontational, even though I probably acted like a suspicious person.

Both officers dedication to duty, mediation skills, and leadership motivated me to realize that there are still great people out there, fighting the good fight.

Now this fella will scavenge almost anything in our squad room, chips left over, old bagels, butter that has crumbled, ANYTHING! 

Well after the pizza was finished, someone decided to put all the crusts in the box and give the box filled with crusts and empty cigarette packs to our loving scavenger. He took one look inside the empty box, and winged it at the delivery man!

Last night, (Saturday) is always the busiest night because of fireworks. I was given the night off because I had already worked 9 hours that day and extra help was not needed. I ended up going to the festival with some friends in civilian clothing. I was congregating with old high school buddies by some picnic tables when I was called over by a guy and his girlfriend who I had also recognized that were sitting one table over, eating. The Exchanged conversation went like this:

Him: Hey wanna buy some bud?

me: What do you mean by bud?

him: Weed, wanna buy some weed?

me: How much? Do you have it on you? (I wanted to make sure he was serious and it was on him so that I could call an officer over.)

him:Yea, lets go to the bathrooms.

me: You're joking right?

him: No, lets go.

me: You *know* I work for the police department right?

him: *shit grinning* No you don't. 

me: (I turn to his girlfriend) Maybe you can help him, remember when I was at your house with Ofc. ______ when you were getting your things after a domestic and we found drug paraphernalia? 

her: No, didn't we go to high school together or something? 

me: (turn back to the male) You seriously think I'm kidding?

him: Yes. (but no longer smirking, slightly scared.)

me: Okay, watch this- (I spotted a uniformed police officer and called him over. At which point the guy gets up and speed walks off.)

The officer grabbed him, and was talking to him but immediately detained him because he kept digging in his pockets and wouldn't take them out after several commands to do so. He had three baggies of weed on him. He's known to be a seller but I didn't think they would be that dumb. They got him for possession with intent to deliver.

**To be clear, he had three 1/8 baggies of marijuana. Why I went out of my way to get a uniform officer to arrest him? Aside from him thinking I was joking, the house that I was at with his gf was also his house. He deals heroin from it. So marijuana may be small stuff, but heroin is beginning to be a big problem here and I helped reduce it by getting his ass off the street.**",,False,self,t5_2ug10,1376289438.0,,,True,t3_1k692r,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1k692r/was_at_a_small_city_festival_when_a_guy_and_his/,

I'm aware not all cops are bad, but honestly need that reinforced quite a bit at this point in my life. With how the LAPD chose to handle such a high profile case with Dorner to smaller issues happening daily all over America I'm very interested in hearing some of ya'lls opinions on a few specific things. 

I have no desire to turn this into any sort of flaming, and I will do my level best to remain respectful and stick to factual statements. I do think it necessary for civilians to have an avenue to discuss issues we have with policing with actual police though because no story ever has only one side. 

I have no idea what to expect posting here, so I'm going to include a few links to current stories that I find particularly infuriating related to police behavior. 

I apologize if this is inappropriate for this sub, I just don't really know where else to do this.

1. Dorner - specifically the kneejerk reaction that ended up getting innocents (women?! really!?!) shot
2. The NC rapper in Fayeteville arrested for 'trespassing' (http://goo.gl/6ZaoF)
3. 4 cops watch a 5th shoot an unarmed man to death, shooter is cleared of all wrondoing but family is awared 8.8mil in a civil suit (http://goo.gl/Db1qY)
4. Kenneth Chamberlain Sr. (http://goo.gl/vQ2LZ)
5. NY stop and frisk policy (http://goo.gl/37qXA)

**Edit:**
6.  What sort of economic constraints do you feel, (personal paycheck or equipping the force)? Are they addressed specifically? Common knowledge? What size department do you work for? Where is your primary funding, city, state, federal? 

A little different but definitely a piece of the puzzle. 

**Edit 2:**
Read the Violence and the Police link on the side bar and in particular his discussion of the ladder of escalation rang loudly to me.  Seriously, thanks and shout out to /u/krautcop very well written.  Wow, kept reading through that whole thread and it's definitely added some perspective.

A belligerent, drunken man was covered in blood while being arrested.  Even though he was acting like an ass screaming his head off and threatening the officers, the glove-wearing cops were keeping him still while the paramedics were cleaning him off and tending to his wounds (he got in a drunken fight with some civilian).

It really made me pause to think about this guy getting great care even while he's being arrested, and strangely, made be proud to be an American.  But also, thinking about all those cops dealing with the uncertainty of blood borne diseases, the fact that the guy could be armed, his wife is losing her shit nearby - and still, cops have to go in and settle everything down.  That's pretty damn awesome.  Thank you.

And thanks for working to keep our neighborhoods safe.  I'm in downtown Los Angeles and shit gets scary sometimes.  Whenever the sirens start going and the helicopters hover over our neighborhood, it's always comforting to listen to the police scanner and know that there are people who work to keep the neighborhood safe.

One last thank you, in LA, police officers ride along with our major monthly bike ride.  Some of the teenagers get a little grumpy that they can't smoke weed on the ride, but the rest of us are happy to have police officers alongside us.  There's one cop on a loudspeaker in charge of keeping the cyclists in the furthermost lane, he always gets a laugh with his ""Hipsters, stay to the right"" line.

Yes, I'm using a throwaway because I'm going to be brutally honest with my embarrassing answers.  

Quick background:  I applied to a suburban dept, with about 450 applicants for 2 positions.  After a two year process of tests and what not it came down to three candidates - I, included.  The last phase before the conditional offer of employment was the poly.  I researched the polygraph phase on the internet and one thing kept sticking out on every website - JUST BE HONEST.  I've never really been a bad individual or done too many criminal activities - no previous drug use, good on financials, no serious convictions, etc. So, I figured, I'll be honest and nothing can go wrong.

I thought the process would be breeze.  Man oh man, I was wrong.  After being brutally honest even when I wanted to lie, I was still turned down for the position.  After the poly the examiner told me that I'd ""passed"" and he didn't believe I was ""deceptive.""  But, my answers, wow...

I can only assume my answers led me to be the candidate denied the position.  So, here's some answers I remember saying ""yes"" to:

Have you ever masturbated while driving a vehicle?
-Yes, when I was 17 years old.

Have you ever engaged in prostitution?
-Yes, when I was 17.  The school chaplain (Catholic H.S.) paid me for sexual favors in cash and gifts.

Have you ever had group sex?
-Yes, twice.

Have you ever masturbated at work?
-Yes, a few times during third shift when I was younger; most recently probably two years ago

Have you ever performed a sexual act with someone while at work?
-Yes, a former classmate of mine came into my office and we had sex.  Probably two years ago.

Have you ever ""sexted"" someone?
-Yes.  Most recently probably a year ago to my now ex.

Have you ever had sex with a minor?
Yes, sex partner was 17, I was 19.  Happened maybe a dozen times with same sex partner. 

These are all I can remember for now; but I think I covered everything.  After the experience I kind of realized how much of a scumbag I was and knew that after the chief read my answers there would be no way I would get hired - even though I was honest and apparently passed.  I still feel like a scumbag, but whatever, this is a throwaway.  My plan on my next poly or voice stress is to lie, I guess.  

Anyone care to share their embarrassing answers to make me feel a little better?

Should I?,sufentanil,46,14,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1je04s/i_am_a_lawyer_and_want_to_join_the_police_should_i/,"I am a young attorney that has been working in Tax for about 4 years now (middle size firm). I make a good salary, live a decent life. Other than my career I have few attachments--no student loans, decent savings, no kids. 

I have my B.S. in Biology (initially wanted to go to medical school), an additional bachelor's in philosophy, and my J.D. 

For most of my adult life I have been critical of the police--both from a practical and pragmatic standpoint in everyday life, in philosophical and political terms, and mostly for the past decade: legally. However, as I have more and more contact through the police throughout the past few years I have grown a deep and sincere respect for the force. I am in good physical health (a runner), there really aren't any small complications holding me back--I am not asking about the details. On a very fundamental level, do you think this is an ethical move? I am looking to do good in the community, in my personal life, and in the world. 

I want to be an ethical person and use my skills towards a good use. Becoming an officer is simply an *honest* job. Where I am at now, I can't really say the same. 

Have you known of any cops that are ex-lawyers or vice versa?

1369411589.0,30,self.ProtectAndServe,1ez6yl,Rant: An inebriated off-duty Lt. pulled rank and denigrated my program when I asked him to get out of the street,AuxLE,42,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1ez6yl/rant_an_inebriated_offduty_lt_pulled_rank_and/,"I'm just an auxiliary in huge city, just one of thousands of volunteers. But I like to think that wearing the same uniform and trying to serve my city deserved some modicum of professionalism and respect. I am not a sworn member of service, though I hope to be in the future. 

Last night, my partner and I were directing traffic at a busy nightlife area with my coordinator, a 12-year veteran and actual MOS who was just behind us, writing up some tickets. I was trying to keep traffic from snarling at an intersection when a group of men started crossing diagonally and sauntering down the middle of the street, thus preventing vehicles from passing through the intersection. I asked them to please get out of the street so cars could pass by and one of them yelled ""F- you, you aren't even a real cop."" My CO heard this and turned to the group, informing them that he was a real cop and demanding that they get out of the street as I had directed because they were obstructing traffic. 
The group stood their ground in the middle of the street and wouldn't back away and when my CO told them that they needed to obey his lawful order to leave the street, they got belligerent and in his face. Then the original guy starts threatening my CO and pulls out his Lt. badge, laughs, and saunters away with his group. 

I'm just so frustrated. It wasn't worth the time and effort of my CO calling in the duty captain who, I'm certain, would have been on our side in this matter. 

I'm somewhat ok with this Lt. calling us fake cops - I know that we probably look ridiculous to lots of regulars, as if we were kids playing dress-up. I've gotten that from time to time and I understand it. We're volunteers with limited training, capability, and function. 
But what really gets me is that this Lt. found fit to pull rank on a uniformed officer - my CO - who is just trying to do his job. This Lt. and his buddies who are out drinking and having a good time and who ought to know better than to walk down the middle of the street. These guys who are supposed to know what it's like to deal with traffic at a busy intersection and what the street level cop has to deal with. 
Instead, he gets in my CO's face, dares him to do something, and walks off like he's the king of the world. He abused his badge, he abused his authority, and he sullied the reputation of the department. Other pedestrians saw this interaction, saw him flip out his badge and walk away. 

I love law enforcement. I think 9/10 cops are outstanding and dedicated officers. Every Sgt. and Lt. I've met at my precinct has been respectful, professional, and full of integrity. I can't wait to keep going forward and pursuing a career, no a calling, in keeping the peace. But sometimes, things like this just really rub me the wrong way.

This pic was on /r/funny and I found it kind of upsetting. http://i.imgur.com/z0OJYvl.jpg. What should be done with officers like this? Should departments monitor officers health more closely to help curb weight gain before it becomes a almost unmanageable problem? Should behavioral processes be put in place for officers that don't change their habits? Or...is this okay? Even The Biggest Loser this season had a obese cop on it as a contestant. 

Also, do you have a duty to say something to another officer if you see this? I mean if he is supposed to have your back, can he really? You would lose him on a foot pursuit, he won't be able to climb stairs, and he wouldn't have much endurance in a ""hands on"" situation.

The car operates according to sets of sensors and algorithms.

Generally the way the car behaves is that it drives in the middle of the lane and goes the speed limit, based on speed limit data it has stored.


[Here's a thread over in /r/Futurology](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1dzk9l/) in which someone encountered one of these on the road.

Now, we have at least [one anecdotal report of one of these cars speeding](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1dzk9l/pardon_me_future_go_right_ahead/c9vfgpo).  Probably because the stored speed limit data doesn't match the actual situation on the road.

Right now, my understanding is that all of these cars have a person sitting behind the wheel (for legal/liability reasons), although the algorithm may be driving.

My questions for you are as follows:

1.  If you see a Google driverless car violating the law, do you perform a traffic stop?

2.  If the car fails to stop for you (perhaps the car doesn't know what to do with your lights and siren data, due either to bad programming or a bug), what do you do?  (Is that fleeing and eluding or failing to stop?  Do you push the issue on that?)

3.  If there is a person behind the wheel (let's pretend the car stopped as it was supposed to, and it was speeding), but he says the computer was driving, what do you do?  (And if you *do* ticket him, do you add a charge of careless driving because he was reading a book while his car was speeding?)

4.  What if [the guy behind the wheel was legally blind](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2402340,00.asp)?  

5.  Suppose you stop the car, it pulls over, and there is *no one in the vehicle.*  What do you do?

I thought I'd show and speak my mind over on /r/police but quickly learned that was a mistake as that subreddit is anti-police to the core. So I came here to speak my mind. First my background is growing up as the son of two law enforcers my father a deputy and my mother a records clerk who worked with out drug task force. I am currently seeking out and officer position now that I've graduated college. I guess what I've noticed is how the public forgets police are human. This creates the ""us vs. them"" mentality as police feel the public generally hates them. Their are bad cops trust me I've seen it, but the amount of hate on reddit comes from the majority of members of the public who feed off the media. I can pull this number out of my ass but probably 1 in 10 stories on cops is good while the other 9 show them screwing up. 
People seem to think cops have no emotions when in truth they have to deal with all the shit the public gives them and put on a happy face. I don't think the public understands that cops deal with child deaths, rapes, brutal murders and  then go home and act like everything is fine. Cops love dark humor because they have to in order to survive the stress and emotions of the job. Out of all emergency responders cops get the least love but do the most in my opinion. Firefighters are always loved, paramedics as well but no love to cops. Yes the videos of the past days are examples of horrible cops all though some are not in context at all. You can go on youtube and find less videos on cops being shot and abused then the other way around. This is my rant but it was needed cops are my family I saw this when my father passed away, as the amount of support form his agency was touching to see the bond formed. So I don't care if this gets downvoted but I needed to say something.

Tired, grumpy, hungry, and wanting a drink.

Having plenty of time on my hands (I was doing overtime to babysit a prisoner in the cells who was asleep whilst our nightshift crew were dealing with a suicidal female) I was sitting in the office wondering what was giving me job satisfaction.

I had moved from one of the busiest 3 stations in my state to ... a very quiet station. I was used to armed rob, agg burg, serious assault. I moved to... Little Johnny wasn't nice to Anne-Marie, fix it. I was wondering what it was I was doing, and why I was doing it. How am I changing my community, making it better?

I spent tonight, Saturday night, pulling over cars for not having lights, tail lights, indicators operating properly. For having bald tyres, for driving 10km over the speed limit, for having too many passengers whilst being on a restricted licence.

I realised why I still loved doing what I do, in these last 8 hours.

I realised that every time I had a discussion with a friend, or a relative, they delighted in telling me about an incident with a friend of a friend of theirs who was pulled over by the police and X or Y happened. Whether it was positive or negative.

Not only do people talk about police encounters to their friends, but those friends talk about it to their friends. Every police interaction with someone affects the opinion of 15 other people.

Every interaction I had tonight I was positive, friendly, jocular and polite. Whether someone got a ticket, or 2, or a warning, or they had to fix something on their car, I've never had more people laugh, be polite, or thank me.

That's why I love my job, and that's why I do what I do. Ignoring the potential road safety improvements that 20 newly working indicators, or tail lights will have on the road, hopefully I just made 300 people think more positively of the police. So maybe, next time, a brother is less likely to get attacked unprovoked, or is more likely to get information for a serious crime.

I was sitting at a red light the other night on duty and decided to run the plates of the truck sitting next to me. They came up expired for approximately two years. I flip my lights on and initiate a stop. My cover officer discovered a rifle and ammunition in plain view from the passenger side that I could not see from the driver's side. We will call this guy Fred. 

We ask Fred to exit the vehicle. His inspection, motor vehicle registration and trailer tags were all out of date. Along with this, he had no proof of insurance. I ran his license and it came back that he had a warrant out for his arrest. We informed Fred that he would be under arrest for the warrant. We give him some time to make some phone calls to get someone to pick up the truck and trailer so that it isn't towed and then stored until they prove insurance on it etc. He begins to thank us for that. Where I work, we have the option of issuing citations right away or we could really mail a citation up to two years later. 

I realize that people lie to us and it is commonplace, but I felt that Fred was being genuine. He borrowed the truck and trailer and has been working his butt off trimming trees to save money up to get his CDL so that he could get a real career going. This whole time he is worried about the citations and the effect that they would have on his CDL. 

I feel that he is being genuine and since the warrant stems from his inability to pay a previous ticket, I feel a little bad for him. I realize that there are people who deserve tickets and a ticket is issued to correct behavior, but I believe Fred genuinely learned his lesson through the whole ordeal. 

Anyway, we get to the jail and I walk him over to the check-in area. I took his cuffs off early because he had been cooperative and was complaining of an itch in his mustache that was ""killing him"". He thanked me for that. He repeatedly told us that we were the most courteous officers he has ever dealt with. Anyway, at the check-in area, Fred looks at my other officer. My other officer looks back at him and says ""whatever happens with those citations are up to him"" as he points to me. I look at Fred and explain to him to check and make sure that a vehicle is legal before driving it. Also, I tell him to pay attention to little things like insurance and inspections stickers. 

I then verbally warn him about the citations that I could have issued. He almost broke down crying in joy. He was actually happy to be in jail. I probably saved him $1500 in citations. 

I feel that I genuinely corrected behavior while making a positive impact in one's life.

We went back and booked another person in later that night and learned that one of Fred's friends had already gotten him out of jail. I wish to see Fred again on different terms because I genuinely feel that he is happy and extremely impressed by the mercy that I showed him.

/r/Protectandserve  Thank you all for what you do. I am thankful that I now have an opportunity to serve and hope to positively affect my community. I look forward to being brothers and sisters in arms with you all. 

TL/DR: I saved a guy nearly $1500 in citations and he was happy to be in jail.",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,,True,t3_16lw9n,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/16lw9n/in_response_to_1013_and_making_a_difference_in/,

What would the average citizen say if it were proposed that Police Officers be assigned to a neighborhood which was inhabited by no one but criminals and those Officers would be unarmed, patrol on foot and be heavily outnumbered?  I wager that the overwhelming public response would be that the Officers would have to be crazy to accept such an assignment.  However as you read this, such a scenario is being played out in all areas of the country.

We are Correctional Officers and Deputies.  Not Guards (who are people that watch school crossings).  We work at minimum, medium, and maximum security Correctional Facilities.  We are empowered by the State to enforce its Penal Laws, rules, and regulations of the Department of Correctional Services.  In short we are Policemen.  Our beat is totally inhabited by felons who, by definition, are people who tend to break laws, rules, and regulations.  We are outnumbered by as many as 50 to 1 at various times of our work day and contrary to popular belief, we work without a side arm.  In short, our necks are on the line every minute of every day.

A Correctional Facility is a very misunderstood environment.  The average person has very little knowledge of its workings.  Society sends it's criminals to Correctional Facilities and as time passes, each criminals crime fades from our memory until the collective jail/prison population becomes hordes of bad people being warehoused away from decent society in a place where they can cause no further harm.  There is also the notion that inmates cease to be a problem when they are incarcerated.

Correctional Facilities are full of violence perpetrated by the jail population against the jail population and facility staff.   Felonies are committed daily but are rarely reported.  They are called ""unusual incidents"" and rarely result in criminal prosecution.  Discipline is handled internally and, as a rule, the public is rarely informed of these crimes.  In the course of maintaining order in these facilities, many Officers have endured the humiliation of having urine and feces thrown at them.  Uncounted Correctional Officers/Deputies have been kicked, bitten, stabbed and slashed with homemade weapons, taken hostage, murdered and even raped in the line of duty, all while being legally mandated to  maintain their Professional Composure and refraining from any retaliation which could be the basis for dismissal from service.

In addition to these obvious dangers, Correctional Officers face hidden dangers in the form of AIDS, Tuberculosis, Hepatitis B and C.  Courts are now imposing longer sentences and the jail and prison population is increasing far beyond the systems designated capacity.  As the public demands more police on the street, governments everywhere are cutting police in Correctional Facilities where violence reins supreme, jeopardizing all those working behind prison walls.

Although you will never see us on ""911"" or ""Top Cops"" we are Law Enforcement Professionals.  We are the ""FORGOTTEN COP,"" hidden from public view, doing a dangerous beat, hoping someday to receive the respect and approval from the public who ""WE SILENTLY SERVE.""

As many of you know, there have been two subreddits for members of the Law Enforcement Community, us and /r/LawEnforcement.

For a while now, I’ve thought that this split of the community was a waste of potential and so I (krautcop) asked both 10-13 and the moderation team of /r/LawEnforcement if they would consider merging the two subreddits.

Both parties agreed and after some negotiating, we are now happy to announce that /r/LawEnforcement will merge into /r/ProtectAndServe, effective immediately.

This means that /r/LawEnforcement will from now on redirect users to /r/ProtectAndServe and show information about the merge in the sidebar.

The moderation team of /r/LawEnforcement will be taken on as moderators on /r/ProtectAndServe.

We welcome all new users from /r/LawEnforcement to this subreddit, and invite all sworn Law Enforcement Officers to the private, sworn-LEO only subreddit /r/LEO. Please refer to the sidebar on how to gain access to it.

However for public safety wouldn't record any encounters as I'm too lazy to edit. And I would not be using my dash cam. I bought a stand which I can place my phone in, with a 128GB SD card for $15 and thought you guys might be interested in seeing the night of a trooper. Maybe I can get a few of us in on it too. I'll be using my android phone and a recording app

Here's the stand: I suggest you all buy one as they're great for GPS/recording. I currently use mine for the voice navigation, and sometimes request dispatch to give me a lat/longitude to make things easier as there's some pretty crappy street names. Google Navigation -- It's way better than a garmin

Is what I use as a stand



But any ways, what kinds of things do you think would make P&amp;S better and more interesting? As a mod I want to have special events once a week, where we can challenge each other to shooting contests at the range, and others where we ask arrestees with drug addiction/violent history if they'd like to make a small video telling others what to avoid and how to avoid the life-style so good upcoming adults can see it first hand. I want the police haters/skeptics to know that we are out here helping!

I have my first oral board coming up and was wondering what to expect. What are some of the questions that are always asked? Also, I am curious to know what the most difficult question asked was when you went through oral boards.

What are some tips that will make me shine above the rest that most people don't typically think about going into these things?

1369190553.0,24,self.ProtectAndServe,1et5cg,Can you honestly say that you wake up everyday and love what you do?,darushman86,33,9,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1et5cg/can_you_honestly_say_that_you_wake_up_everyday/,"I am a 22 year old accoutant. I am noticing that as each day passes, I hate my job more and more. I do not want to be stuck in a cubicle my whole life. I stare at the clock the entire day until it is time to leave. I feel that I only chose this profession to follow in my father's footsteps, and to make my parents/family happy. It has always been my dream to be a police officer, but now my dreams are slowly fading away. Sure, the money is good, but what's the point if I hate getting up in the morning and driving to a job I don't like every single day? I recently applied to the police academy, and didn't tell anybody.

I have been attracted to law enforcement my whole life. I truly want to help people. I want to put that smile on a child's face. I want to help a poor soul on the highway whos car has broken down, and brighten up their day. I want to get drunks like the one who killed my friend off the road, before they can destroy other people's lives. 

Hell, for fun I even read my home town's ordinances and crime code. I'm obsessed all the police TV shows, like ""Speeders"", ""Cops"", you name it. I have the police scanner app on my phone that I listen to, I dress up like a cop every year for halloween, and have handcuffs dangling from my rear view mirror. Yeah, you could say I'm obsessed, but I love the profession. If I were to be a cop, it would be my goal to go all the way to the top as chief of police.


I am just concerned that before I go forward with my career change, that I won't regret it in the future. I don't care about being the richest guy in the world. Happiness to me not having tons of money. Happiness is friends, family, reading good books, watching good movies, traveling from time to time, and LOVING YOUR JOB ect. I don't care about having the fastest car or biggest house. I want a job where I can be outside, and embrace the world that I am in, protecting and serving others. I feel that being stuck in an office all day every day is no way to live. I enjoy the freedom and power that police officers have.

I know that there are many cons that police endure like department politics, dealing with scumbags everyday, dealing with supervisors, odd scheduling that interferes with family life, ect. But basically, I need some advice, and the way I can narrow it down into a question is: Do you wake up everyday, and look forward to work, loving what you do?

tl;dr: I'm an accountant that hates his job and wants to follow his dream to be a cop, but I am afraid cops eventually dislike going to work, and I don't want this to happen.

* Most front line officers work out of their car... so if you see a cop sitting in a cruiser (or even chatting with another cop) instead of patrolling around, they could be doing paperwork, on a break, or on lunch.  If they were to go back to the station for each of those, they'd be out of position for 911 response.

[Video One](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=D20s2Fw9uqs)

So we have a Police Officer who is presumably trying to unlawfully arrest an innocent disabled man who hasn't done anything wrong. Even the other police officer is trying to stop him.

[Video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=wfftgb4KOlE)

Turns out the innocent disabled man isn't exactly innocent or disabled as we first thought because his disability doesn't hinder him in physically lifting the officer off his feet with one arm and slamming the officer onto a car bonnet. Then somebody else jumps in and tries to **choke** the officer to death before he gets punched in the face by the police medic.

But that doesn't mean that the other things don't stay with me.

Because we talk about that kind of shit. And everyone wants to hear it. So I got to thinking about just how grotesque that must have been. And then, on my long desert road drive home, my mind began to wander again.

And I started to think about those last seconds of life. Those last terrifying, panicked, horrible moments in a persons life. Shortly before they are ran over, sucked in, torn, ripped, squashed, cut, shot, alone, scared, confused, and dying. And I wonder what that must be like. And then I think that hopefully there is a built in mechanism, like a surge protector, that prevents your brain from even receiving the overload of pain and emotion. And I start to think about specific cases, and how much I hope that they didn't hurt. And I think. And I think.

And I think about child who was run over by a fork lift, and roofer who fell to the ground, and construction worker who was sucked into an auger, and girl who ran herself over, and decomposing guy on white leather couch, and old man on the toilet, and little girl in the wheel well, and suicide behind the mortuary, and mummified lady, and teenage boy in the Firebird, and guy who was shot at the Mexican food joint, and wife duct taped to bed and set on fire, and smoke shop employee, and t-boned kid in the burning car, and suicide by shotgun at the airport, and lady in hospice, and baseball player who was dumped, and 21 day old baby, and those three Hispanic ladies, and cheerleader with asthma.

Furthermore, even a first name and a location can get you some decent stuff on Facebook. As an investigator (not professional) who does favors for friends including data mining on people's presence on the 'net, I heartily suggest you check out Paterva Maltego and test out searches on various social networks and search engines yourself.

All the police and detectives I've talked to are generally clueless about technology and tools. I'm not going to say it's a large sampling, but of 20 or 30 total, maybe 5 detectives? Yeah, I've had some good conversations filling them in on stuff like this. This, plus data mining (textpipe) and other scraping tools linked together (scrapebox is neat, even for this type of stuff) and tools for mirroring like Offline Explorer allow you to archive stuff and search it fast if you're looking for needles in haystacks.


The easiest way to find someone I've found it common usernames or common people that you can use for context. If you worked hard enough, you could find out who I am with my username and Reddit post history. Not that I spell out my name, but I've spelled out sites, I own domains, etc.

As the guy says in the tutorial above ""The real power of -searching for information about people and groups- [Maltego] is when -you do a lot of searches- [you run a whole lot of them] and look at how they link together.


Maltego links those things together. I could probably track down a number of people associated with bad things and would if someone would pay me. I've used it for everything from finding out who someone really is to finding unlisted addresses and phone numbers.

The other night while on a ride along, my unit (The officer and I) responded to an emergency call out of an injured woman. The initial Dispatch detail was that she was having chest pain. As we were en route, the dispatcher updated the call information. First with, along with the chest pain, trouble breathing, then she was reportedly Unconscious, (around this time we were pulling into the neighborhood) 
as we looked for the house the dispatcher reported she was unresponsive and not breathing. 

As we pulled in we pulled out our equipment ( a VBM and a defibrillator)
we entered the room where she was in, The officer started chest compression as I unpacked the defibrillator. Then the paramedics/firemen arrived and pronounced her dead.  

The thing I need advice on is the days after that, I have this feeling of guilt, that I could have done more, that we didnt get their fast enough. Is that normal? Should I feel like this?

- Thanks for all the advice everyone

I used to believe that female officers had no place outside the public relations or education units, that putting a 120lb woman out on the road with domestics and drunks and the mentally ill was a giant waste of taxpayers' money.

However, I've read some studies (please don't ask for citations, I can't remember them... google if you must) that show people generally respond more rationally and calmly to a female in stressful situations.  I have carefully broached the subject with a couple of officers - carefully because I have no urge to end up in *my* HR department getting 'sexist' recorded in my file along with some form of punishment administered.

I had a (large) male officer tell me that sometimes just his presence at a potential fight seems to trigger it, that he's seen as some kind of challenge and is preferentially attacked before the other, smaller officers (male or female).

I had a (petite) female officer tell me that she often gets dispatched to domestics and can make a peaceful arrest and later break guys into tears and a confession with a few kind words where male officers usually have to result to force for the arrest and don't get any cooperation in an interview.

I've sort of come around to the possibility that there is a place for both kinds of officers - the social worker and the brawler.  On the other hand, I can imagine when things do get physical that a female officer on average is going to have to resort to pepper spray or a firearm a lot sooner than a male officer.

My question is this: for the more physically imposing males here, how do you *really* feel about the less physically imposing female officers sharing the road with you?  Do the benefits outweigh the costs?",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,,True,t3_162cc5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/162cc5/question_for_male_officers_about_female_officers/,

I'm new to the Bay Area and just stopped an extremely nice Benz for running a red.  Inside the car are three teenagers (all males) who are dressed like gangsters, however they're extremely polite and the driver's home address indicates he's from a well off family.  

The stop is going well we even made a bit of small talk, I'm sitting in my cruiser doing all the paperwork when a Benz in the oncoming lane slows down, pulls a U-Turn and comes to a stop behind my cruiser.  An older male exits the Benz and goes running past my cruiser.

As I'm just sitting there going ""WTF is this shit?"", he yanks open the driver's side door and proceeds to perform this weird combination of slapping the driver and dragging the driver from the vehicle.  He pulls the driver around in front of the car and continues to hit him and yell at him, the driver just stands there taking it.  

I finally recover meanwhile and head for the pair, as I'm going by the Benz though one of the passengers leans out and calls at me to not get involved because if I stop it now ""it will just be worse when they get home.""  Meanwhile the father has noticed his son has a tattoo on his upper forearm and is screaming at him for getting a tattoo and telling him he's going to give his mother a heart attack.  

So I have my quandary, the younger driver doesn't really seem to be fighting back, but I'm a cop, I just can't stand there while someone gets the hell slapped out of them on the street, right?   I go in and separate them, confirm the the older man is the father.  I take the teenager aside for a moment and ask him if he wants me to do anything about this and get a firm ""no, please no"" from the teenager.  

For the rest of the stop the dad stands there when I'm speaking with the teenager, every time the teen says something dad whacks him on the back of the head and tells him to be more respectful, even though the teen was behaving just fine.  The father also insists I write the ticket (after the kid got smacked around I was going to cut this down to a warning).  When I go back to the cruiser to finish off the ticket I can still hear dad yelling at his son for dressing like that, driving like that, embarrassing the family (if you haven't guessed by now, I'm the only non Asian involved in this scene).  When I come back with the ticket, dad is on the phone to get a tow truck because he's taking the car away right now.  Dad also tries to make his son pay the ticket right now and has his son apologize to me for making me write the ticket in the first place.  I explain how the ticket will take two days to be on file and you can pay it at the city administration center.  

A week later I get a handwritten letter of apology from the guy I pulled over.  I can just see his dad standing over him going *slap* ""Write more respectfully!"" *slap*

Two years later I run into the same guy after he was rear ended.  When I do the report I'm careful to write out ""DRIVER 1 NOT AT FAULT"" in big block letters on my report so he can show his father.  

Weirdest thing was the father never asked what I pulled his son over for, just assumed his son was at fault for something worth chewing him out over.",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,,True,t3_1hkld2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1hkld2/surrealist_encounter/,

As soon as I saw them I began calling 911. When they saw me they took off. I had a concealed handgun in my car during all this. I did not draw on them or brandish my firearm at any time as I felt the situation did not require it. I felt safer in my locked vehicle without introducing a firearm into the equation. However, would I be within the law if I drew my firearm on them and told them to get down? Would you have done anything differently? I keep running through the scenario in my head. Thanks

I know I personally, as a cop from Australia, have a heap of questions for you guys, and I thought you might have some for those of us not operating in the US.

Maybe we could use this as a place to ask other international police forces some questions?


In Australia, the police is operated per state. We have 7 states. So we have 7 state police forces, and 1 federal agency. That's it, you don't get ""employed"" by an agency like I see a lot of you guys talking about. In Victoria, one of the states in Aus, We apply through an external agency to sit an exam, do that, then undertake another series of tests (physical, psychological, personal interview, etc.) and then get offered a spot in that states in academy. We do that, then we graduate and get sent to a station anywhere within that state. As far as I'm aware, almost every state operates in a similar fashion (some have different recruitment processes, but if you apply to a state, you enforce that states laws. (To put this in comparison, if you apply to join the Western Australian Police Force, you can be sent anywhere within 2.5 million km2 area, an area roughly 3.6 times bigger than Texas)

It seems like in the US you guys have... towns (counties?) that operate their own police forces. I imagine they perform the type of ""uniform"" jobs in that area that we do for our state. As in, responding to assaults, domestics, drug trades etc, disputes, welfare checks etc. So does one town (county?) only enforce \ have jurisdiction in THEIR town\county, or do they have it throughout the entire state?

Then you have... State troopers? What is that? I have difficulty understanding how they operate if each town\county operates their own force?

How does funding work for towns that have tiny populations? Is the dept. funded by that towns tax-payers, or is the department funded by their respective state?

I may be way off the mark here, but that's my limited understanding I've gleaned from this subreddit and from TV shows (... lol)


What gear do you guys carry? How many Firearms? How many sets of cuffs? What other gear?

Personally, as a right hander, on my right hand side, I carry a Smith and Wesson M&amp;P40 semi-auto (Which is issued by my dept. I get no choice in it, it stays at the station, it gets issued to me when I clock it on, and I return it when I clock off), a spare mag, and a small torch. On my Left hand side, I carry (in order of closest to my front, to furthest away), an OC Spray, 1 set of handcuffs in a pouch with several sets of latex gloves, 1 ASP extendable baton, and 1 (of my own, rather than dept. issue) Leatherman and 1 portable radio.
If I wore an IOEV (Integrated Operational Equiptment Vest) [Kevlar vest] I would wear everything on my vest other than my firearm which would stay on my hip.

It seems like a lot of you guys carry a second shooter somewhere, plus several sets of cuffs, as well as other equipment. I know some guys at my station carry a second set of cuffs to cuff larger offenders, but I've personally never found it necessary.



How does paperwork work for you guys? For us, if we get a job for an offender, and it turns out we identify an offence, we will apprehend the offender, arrest them, convey them to the station, interview them on disc (ie asking them a series of questions), release them either pending summons, on bail, or we will make an application to remand them in custody. In all of these instances, the arresting officer is responsible for the resulting paperwork, which is... even for the most simple assault \ theft, approximately 4 hours of paperwork, or way more, depending on how many statements there are to be taken, evidence to be gathered). 

How does it work for you guys?

I live in a big city (Vancouver, BC) and have at times seen solo cops (and sometimes in pairs with a partner) struggling to contain someone and get the cuffs on them. I would be more than happy to hop in there and do my best to help, but have never done so because I'm a) afraid I'll get barked at, and b) worried I might actually contribute to the problem/be a pain the ass. I guess I could throw fear of a surprise stab wound in there as well. 

So, to sum it up: if you're struggling with someone (be it getting cuffs on, subduing them, in a foot chase, etc.), do you want a member of the public to help you out? Or just stay clear and wait for your backup to arrive/for you to eventually (hopefully) get the individual under control? Let the pros handle it, in other words. 

Then again I would think at least offering wouldn't do any harm. 

Thanks!

I recently applied to be a police officer, but can't help but think my chances are pretty slim after hearing how many applications the department receives, often from people with related degrees, military experience, or other LEO jobs. People who have spent years getting to this point. I don't want to sound sheepish, I am confident in my abilities - but on paper I don't think I would get a second look.

For me, the most important thing is that I want to be a police officer. After high school, I went to college for criminal justice for about two years but got a huge opportunity to pursue a hobby that led to many years of professional work within the film industry. It was an incredibly tough choice to make and I don't regret it for the experiences it gave me. I have a bachelors degree in film, have an extensive knowledge of cameras, computers, and software - but not sure how far, if at all, that will get me. You could say my goal of becoming a LEO finally caught back up to me - and I would be leaving a career that pays much more.

I am in decent shape and am not worried about the PT test or any type of background or criminal history checks - clean as a whistle not even a traffic ticket. 

I haven't taken the written test yet. However, I imagine a lot of people do well on the entrance test - that is to say, those that are serious about it. 

I've lived in some unique areas, dealing with all sorts of people. I am CCW permit holder (not that it means anything). I'm a white male, so not going to win any diversity points in this city.

I guess what I am asking is if on paper, none of you having met me personally, would I stand a chance? Is the oral interview an opportunity to overcome some of the on-paper shortfalls? Have any of you experienced this before? 

I appreciate any comments or tips you can give me.
Thanks.

EDIT: I forgot to add that I recently went on two ride-alongs both nightshift weekends. I feel like I got a good understanding of the job, both good and bad.

They're citizens and to the extent that they're not disrupting the social order, why bother them? I have bigger fish to fry. Yes, drug use is a societal ill, but using Police power to solve this level of problem is akin to dispatching a housefly with a hammer. It gets the job done, but there's splatter damage.
In Georgia, misdemeanor possession results in an automatic DL suspension *even if the offense was nowhere near a motor vehicle*. So imagine a kid getting pinched for smoking a joint in the park. He spends a couple days in jail, pleads to First Offender 16-13-2b, and does what he's supposed to do. 4 weeks later, he gets pulled over for DWSL because his license was administratively suspended by DDS. He gets booked and spends another couple days in jail. 
Importantly, he's no longer afraid of going to jail. The fear of being imprisoned is gone and he now has the stigma of 2 arrests.
Enforcement of an unjust law leads people to believe that all laws are unjust.
I'd posit that the officer discovering a group of teenagers smoking dope in a park use the opportunity to speak with them about neighborhood goings-on. Develop them as sources of intelligence.

Well, let's face it, most of the time patrol gets boring. My partner and I play games once in awhile to keep things entertaining and to move the day along. Such games include:

* How many people can you let go from a violation in 1 hour. Current standing record is 17.
* Saying the word ""Meow"" (I'm surprised people don't pick up on this... Usually younger people do and start calling me Farva).
* Stop a Lambo (or any nice car) and explain to the man that he was driving too awesome. (Did this a few times, the guy driving usually get's a kick out of it once he realizes we aren't hitting him with a speeding ticket).
* Do a car stop, give them a blank slip of paper with the words ""Have a nice day AND SLOW DOWN!"" on it. They think they are getting a ticket at first but then laugh really hard after they read it.


These are just a few that we have done. Of course, this is only on rare occasions and in ideal situations that we will pull this stuff off. We wouldn't get any work done if we were joking around all the time after all.

I am still pretty green, having worked in a jail for a year and been on patrol for a little over 13 months.  Today, I encountered a situation that really frustrated me.

My sergeant had called me to the station.  There is a skate park nearby that is a magnet for malfeasance and miscreants.  Today, we had recieved information that a wanted juvenile was there, so we walked over and checked the park.  I located him and took him into custody.  I handed him to my sergeant and as we walked away, one of the boys at the park (17, an adult), started antagonizing my sergeant.  He apparently had a beef with a littering ticket he had received a week or so prior.  He was rather loud and his language profane, so I broke away and confronted the kid.  The kicker is that he is my neighbor.

I first asked him what the problem was, and he could only say that ""That cop is a dickhead.  He's a stupid fucking dickhead.""  Keep in mind, he's on city property, and according to our city's disorderly conduct ordinance, he could be arrested for disturbing the peace.  He and I began a back and forth discussion.  It was heated, but civil.  I didn't want any trouble for this kid, but I was trying to get him to understand an appropriate venue to express his dissatisfaction with police and this particular sergeant, but he wouldn't really have it.  During this discussion, my corporal shows up and clears the gallery that had formed around me and this kid.  After the kid sees that, he says, ""Great, now there's another one.  You guys are always treating me like I have a fucking bomb in my pants or something.""  He ignores my pleas for him to calm down and turns to my corporal and starts berating him about abusing his authority by clearing out the other kids.  All the while, I am almost in the kid's face, pleading with him to stop trying to provoke the corporal.  The kid and I have known each other for a few months, mainly in an official capacity, but we have a good rapport.  He eventually pushes the envelope after the corporal repeatedly told him he was on city property and he needed to change his behavior.  He points right at the corporal, saying, ""You're a fucking dickhead,"" after which, the corporal effects an arrest for Disorderly Conduct and takes the kid to the station.

Before the kid even got the words out of his mouth, I was almost in his face, pleading with him to stop.  I told him, ""I'm giving you ever opportunity to avoid this.  Please don't do this.""  I was so frustrated by this.  He refused to process for the corporal and actually said something rather threatening to him apparently, but I was not there to witness it.

After he was secured in booking, my corporal approached me and asked me if I could process him since I have a rapport with him.  I agreed and sat down with the kid.  Long story short, he is troubled and has a checkered past, but he's made big strides in getting away from his old lifestyle of drug use and deliquency.  He does, however, have an anger problem.

I processed him quickly and gave him a summons to appear in court, but I spent nearly an hour discussing his conduct and trying to find out why he chose to ingore my pleas.  He obviously has some trouble expressing his anger properly, but he also has a problem with police officers in general because of the treatment he has been subjected to.  Except me, he said.  Now, I won't pretend I'm a perfect officer or that my peers are perfect, but I know that a few of the officers he spoke about certainly do have a poor attitude when they are around certain elements of our citizens.  Almost abrasively so.  I spent a lot of time trying to counsel this kid about controlling his emotions and finding an appropriate venue to express them.

I guess my question for you all is this; should I continue making an effort to connect with this kid and help him along?  I have a somewhat unorthodox approach to law enforcement, and in some ways you could say I am a little out of my natural element, but I think my gift is connecting with people.  Is trying to counsel this kid something I should pursue?  Would it be good for me, my department, my community, and most importantly, the kid?

I'd like to hear your thoughts, opinions, and questions.

Non bonded hollowpoint rounds tended to shed their jacket and penetrate deeper with a smaller wound channel,  suggesting minimized stopping power and increased overpenetration

I don't have stats on this, but I've always assumed that most guns on the street were at one point purchased legally and either stolen, or illegally sold. So taking all the guns would eventually lead to less guns for criminals? Yes, I know that's over-simplified but...

I admit, I hate guns and don't want to be around them (except LEOs, who I know are properly trained). They scare the crap out of me.

Also, why do you prefer concealed carry to open carry? If people have to have guns, I want to be able to see them. I feel like I should have a choice if I don't want to sit in a restaurant next to someone armed... concealed carry takes that choice away from me. And I would think it was be better for you guys if you knew someone was armed... Not that criminals will play by the rules, but still... 

I know that 2A will probably not be repealed in my lifetime, but I think gun ownership should be a privilege, not a right. Owning a gun should be hard. I have to take a test to have a driver's license. Why not at least that for owning a gun? As well as psychological testing... for everyone in the house where the gun will be kept? Firearms training? 

To me, 2A isn't working. In my 43 years, I've not met a single civilian gun owner that is part of any sort of well regulated militia. That's just a joke in today's world. When the amendment was written, it was applicable. Today, not so much. 

Help me understand why LEOs (for the most part) are pro-civilian gun ownership.

And be safe out there!!

I'm not quite willing to change my mind just yet... but you have convinced me to learn more about guns and to possibly go to a gun range. My mind is a bit more open now. I'm willing to give my mind a chance to be changed. :-)

A Range-Rover car was engaging in multiple driving infractions on the Paris beltway. At 5:30 am, it refused to stop and accelerated away from a first police car. A second police car participating in the high-speed chase was deliberately rammed from behind at 5:45 am.

Two officers were dead at the scene, a third was severely injured and might not survive. Two men in the SUV were belligerently arrested and placed in custody. ~~It seems~~ The 22-year old driver, who has a police record, was both above the alcohol legal limit and without a driving license.

- [Alleged drunk driver kills two Paris police in chase](http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/french-news/alleged-drunk-driver-kills-two-paris-police-in-chase_259377.html)

- [Article (in French) from *Le Parisien*](http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/paris-un-accident-immobilise-le-periph-porte-de-clignancourt-21-02-2013-2586097.php)

- [Article (in French) from *Le Nouvel Observateur*](http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/faits-divers/20130221.OBS9613/deux-policiers-tues-apres-une-course-poursuite.html)

**Update at 9pm**:

- François Molins, the Paris DA, has stated that there are no traces of braking on the scene; he considers that this proves voluntary intent, and thus he will charge the driver with murders (*homicide volontaire*) and attempted murder. The passenger will be charged with being an accomplice.
- In French law, attempts and complicity have the same maximum sentence as the principal infraction.
- Murder's maximum sentence is 30 years (article 221-1 of the French Penal Code). In this specific case, there are two (maybe three) aggravating circumstances: the murder's purpose was to escape (article 221-2, 2nd paragraph) and the victims were police officers (article 221-4, 4th item). It is possible that the prosecutor might also invoke the 8th item of article 221-4: murder committed by several persons acting as an organized group. (I explain why later)
- Each of these three aggravating circumstances brings by itself the maximum sentence to perpetuity.
- The time during which no parole is available is usually of half the sentence length, or 18 years for perpetuity; the court has the possibility to extend that to two-thirds of the sentence length or 22 years for perpetuity. (article 132-23, 1st and 2nd paragraphs)
- If the DA charges them with the 8th item (acting as an organized group) and the court validates this incrimination (I doubt that they would),  the court has the possibility of extending the no-parole period to 30 years, or even to make parole impossible. (article 221-4, 2nd paragraph)
- As a lawyer familiar with French penal law, I'd say that the driver will be sentenced to 10 to 15 years. With luck, the court will prevent parole for two-third of the sentence, meaning he'll serve at most 7 to 10 years. If the passenger retains a decent lawyer, he will probably walk, unless these morons manage to incriminate each other.
- Driver and passenger are currently (9pm) being interrogated.",,False,self,t5_2ug10,1361479258.0,,,True,t3_18xzkg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/18xzkg/two_officers_dead_and_another_one_severely/,

Figuring hanging up would be a bad idea. I gave the dispatcher where I saw him get off but he kept questioning me as to why I thought he was drunk and explained what I saw at least 3 times. He also seemed really annoyed that I couldn't give him any more information as to where the driver was. The conversation ended with me feeling that I wasted everyone's time instead of actually helping. 
I'm really curious to know if it was even worth it or if I'm sending a cop on a wild goose chase now. Also I had to give my name and phone number which makes me even more uncomfortable about the whole thing. Does this drag me into this should something happen?

I'm a police officer in central Virginia and this request was passed on from the Virginia FUSION center to my agency and others around the state. 

Nathan Norman is a 6 year old boy with terminal cancer. He made news earlier this year by asking his dad to put out their Christmas decorations in September. The decorations made him feel better after his chemotherapy. Soon after his neighbors followed suit and put their decorations up as well. 

Nathan then told his dad that he would like to receive Christmas cards from police officers, firefighters and EMS personnel. This request was forwarded to the Virginia State Police. If you want to send a card the address is included in the article linked below. I would suggest sending the card soon as his outlook doesn't seem promising that he will live to see Christmas.

[Rant.],SPDSKTR,30,17,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1jyq0f/sheriff_deputy_acted_highly_unprofessional_in_my/,"First and foremost, I love law enforcement.  I respect them, I'm polite to them, I cooperate as much as I feel comfortable doing so, etc.  I felt this was unwarranted and downright unnecessary, though.

Due to a storm that blew through yesterday afternoon, several trees had fallen into the roadway, all of which were easily avoidable on the original route to the comedy club yesterday evening.  My girlfriend and I left the comedy club and took a shortcut home, only to find a sheriff patrol car sitting in the oncoming lane with POSSIBLY 8"" of rear bumper in our lane.

I slow down and begin approaching the vehicle, getting ready to squeeze around him, thinking he's either helping direct traffic around another downed tree or there's a wreck at the blind turn he was blocking.  He hits the yelp for a second and I stop to roll my window down (driver's door to driver's door).  The first thing I notice is him drop his phone from his ear to his lap before speaking.

""Did you not see my car sitting here, son?  I'm blocking the road for a reason!"" he yelled.

""With all due respect sir, your car isn't blocking my lane,"" I responded, trying to keep the tone friendly.

""My car can't take up the whole road!"" he yelled at me, getting a very angry tone of voice with me.

Allow me to add this is a two-lane road.  I'm driving my girlfriend's VW Golf, which, when parked sideways, can take up both lanes of traffic.  You all should know a Crown Victoria can take up both lanes and then some.

""You may want to reposition your car so this doesn't happen again, sir.  Like I said before, you're not really blocking our lane,"" I replied in a calm and (attempted) cheerful manner.

""You need to turn the fuck around and go another way.""

I was then pissed.

Without saying another word, I rolled up my window, turned the car around, and tried calling the sheriff's office.  I only got their voice mail, but I left a good one.  Unfortunately, I was so furious, I failed to get his name.  I did tell the sheriff's department when and where the incident took place and gave the voice mail system an earful (which I hope someone actually listened to).

Now... I did leave the complaint anonymously, but do you think anything will actually come of it?  Since they have no way of contacting me, it's the deputy's word against my own.  Should I place a followup call or just assume they're going to deal with this appropriately?  I've interacted with police and sheriff deputies on a multitude of occasions and I've NEVER had a problem like this.

Here's how I feel it should have gone:

**Deputy:**  ""There's a tree in the road/a wreck ahead, so we're having to divert traffic.  You'll have to turn around.""

**Me:**  ""Thank you, sir.  You may want to reposition your car since it's not really blocking our lane.  Sorry about that.""

**Deputy:**  ""Thanks for pointing it out.  Have a good night!""

I've vowed to myself when I decided to begin pursuing a career in law enforcement to never be *that* kind of officer.  People need the type of police they aren't afraid to interact with, not guys like that.  If he was arguing with his girlfriend on the phone, he didn't need to take it out on me.

I was pulled over after making a safe and legal left turn.  The officer who pulled me over said she did so because I'd made a left turn on red.  I didn't argue about this because I don't have a dash cam, so I couldn't immediately *prove* it.

The officer then asked if I'd been drinking.  I answered honestly, I had two beers with dinner, approximately 4 hours earlier.  She then had me step out of the car and walk a straight line and such.  I had no issues performing these tasks.

She asked if she could look in my car and I quietly and politely said 'no, I don't consent to a search.'

She then called somebody to bring a breathalyzer to the scene.  Two more officers showed up 5-10 minutes later, and I was given a breath BAC test.  I blew a 0.00.

She and the new arrivals then opened my car and began searching it.  I again quietly and politely indicated that I had not consented to a search.  The officers directed me to stay where I was and remain silent.  I asked why they were searching my car, and I was directed more forcefully to remain silent.  I remained silent.

They searched the console, glovebox, under the seats, and trunk.  They found no alcohol, drugs, weapons or anything else, because I'm a very boring law-abiding citizen.

I have no wants or warrants out on me.

After they gave up on the search, she told me that I could return to my vehicle and I was free to go.  She said that she would not be ticketing me for the ""illegal turn"" that I did not make.

---

I made a call to the township this morning and asked how many officers work in the department total, and was told that there are only 8 officers in total.  3 of those officers were present during the illegal stop and search.

After the polygraph and second-stage psych test I was talking to one of the hiring officers, and I mentioned my tattoo.  I was just asking what the policy is on covering it or not, and he asked me what it was.  

It's a ""Straight Edge"" tattoo, meaning that I do not drink/smoke/do any drugs.  That's the entire extent of it's meaning, however he did some research and decided that it is gang-related and then started asking if I was affiliated with the ""Straight Edge"" movement, and if I was part of a criminal organization trying to infiltrate the department.  I'm absolutely not affiliated with any criminal organization, and I have always heard the term straight edge for someone that chooses a clean lifestyle free of drugs, sort of a new way of saying ""T-Totaler.""

Unfortunately, this has put my hiring in jeopardy.  I am now waiting until Tuesday or Wednesday when a committee of the higher-ups can convene and determine my fate.  Has anyone else had a similar experience?  Can anyone offer any advice as to what course of action I should take?  I don't want to lose this chance - the job offer has been 10 months in the making, and I am so bummed right now.  Plus I'm afraid that if this department black-lists me as some type of low-life gang-member that I'll not be able to work in law enforcement anywhere!  

Update:  Things actually turned out ok.  I talked to another one of the people on the hiring committee, let them know the full situation, and they said they'd get back to me.  About an hour later I got a phone call that I would be moving on in the process, that one of the deputy chiefs said to bring me on and if anyone had a problem with it he would take responsibility.  

Just to make sure I don't have any problems in the future, I will be covering the tattoo while I am in the process of getting it removed.  It sucks to have to lose it, but I'm serious about a career in law enforcement, so I've gotta do what I've gotta do.  

Not much left to do before getting the final offer either.  Poly, second psych, physical, drug test, and EKG all done... just waiting on a final command staff interview and the final job offer!

My question is in regards to officers you work with:

How do you handle with behavior that is unethical in the police environment: 

If you work with a officer who sometimes uses excessive force in your opinion (or any kind of thing that is wrong), but you don't want to be the ""rat"" or snitch that tells on others when they cross the line.

My problem is that I would feel obligated to talk with them about it before going to report them, but at the same time, if I tell, won't other officers ""not have my back"" sort of thing? 

Everyone is always talking about you having each other's back in the department, but wouldn't trying to do the right thing end up hurting you and your safety in the end?

There are two police departments and a sheriff's office in my county. The sheriff's office and one of the police departments are pretty open. The police department even sent a couple guys over to ask us what we needed during a certain high profile case.

The other police department is very tight-lipped. They fill out the absolute minimum on their incident reports, and never put police reports on their P2C website. When I call about cases, they'll withhold seemingly trivial information, like what type of gun was recovered at the scene of a shooting or how much heroin was found in some guy's house. These facts are usually public record, and I can find them myself if I look hard enough. I've even told the officers as much, and they still won't provide any details without significant prodding.

Another example: We had a murder happen in May, and I personally went and filled out a 911 tape request. We still haven't gotten it.

I'm wondering why there's such a difference in openness with this agency compared to the other agencies in the county and what I can do to maybe warm it up.

As law enforcement officers, what would you want to see from the media that would make you trust in their good faith? How can someone like me, for whom open communication with law enforcement is crucial, reach a reticent agency?

I recently completed my Masters degree in a mental health field and had an internship at a local psychiatric hospital during my advanced year. The hospital doubled as one of the only public hospitals for more than 40 miles, so we received most of the people with mental illness and/or substance abuse problems from a wide area.

Through that experience, I had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with local law enforcement. By the time I completed my internship, I knew most of the officers by name and am still friends with a few of them. It often was beneficial for both sides of the aisle to have a good working relationship, as it was a lot easier to know what to expect out of each other beforehand without having to be explicit. Different patients responded differently to our various skill sets, I suppose.

I know I shouldn't generalize, but having you guys around made it a hell of a lot easier to work with patients that were incredibly drunk or high as a kite on bath salts. In the same vein, I think the local PD appreciated us stepping in when someone was suicidal or depressed. I don't think I'd want to be a LEO, but to be fair, many police officers have told me that they wouldn't want my job either.

I hope that I can maintain a positive relationship with law enforcement throughout my career. Keep your heads up and stay safe out there.",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,,True,t3_1epn5u,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1epn5u/just_a_word_of_thanks_and_appreciation/,

I am an aspiring police officer and Senior in HS from the Midwest. In the last three weeks, I have gone on three ride-alongs in order to determine if LE is truly the career I want to go after. 

The answer is most definitely Yes!

I took pad and paper with me to write notes down so that I could share them here and reflect on them. I am sure that all the officers here are already familiar with these topics, but I would love any discussion, input, and definitely stories you have on them. 

**Ride Along Number One: Suburban Area, medium sized department**

1. Constantly be alert and on the look out. NEVER become comfortable. Being caught off-guard by an assailant, suspect, or a seemingly calm person who rapidly becomes violent is deadly. Constantly scan the crowd surrounding you, the room you are in, the pocket bulges and hand placements of others. Keep your back to a wall whenever possible. Always have the mentality that the person you are dealing with might decide at any second ""I'm not going to prison, and I will kill to stay that way.""

2. Have your ducks in a row with everything you do. Paperwork quickly becomes tedious and dull. Staying thorough and covering every possible base is key to have a tight case. Know what you are doing, then describe it in confidence.

3. Your brothers and sisters in uniform are the most important people on earth. Backing them up safely is priority number one.

4. Don't be a hero. Call for back up before you absolutely need it. 

5. Be tough and assertive but have empathy. Understand people's motivations and what drives them to do what they do, criminal or otherwise. 

6. On a firefighter/EMS assist call, back up and let them do their job. Keep bystanders and gawkers back more than a safe distance at all times.

7. Separating parties is crucial to getting different insights into a situation.

**Ride Along Number Two: Small Town/Rural Area**

1. Patrol Aggressively in search of crime. If you feel like you have nothing to do, you still do. Start your own investigations, take pride and ownership of that. Know your surroundings so well that when something is out of place, immediately check it out.

2. Be friendly and professional. See Verbal Judo.

3. Be extremely visible, especially in high crime areas. Deterrence and prevention is better than response. 

**Ride Along Number Three: Suburban/Urban area.**

1. Estimate a vehicles speed before radar/laser 

2. Be nice to the EMT's and firefighters, they will save your life someday.

3. Learn Spanish

4. Never forget you are protecting a community as well as the people inside it.

5. Your family comes first, but leave family problems at the door.

6. Check the trunk to see if it is popped with a touch on traffic stops. Not doing so can get you killed.

7. Anticipate movement by watching a suspect's eyes and hands.

8. If you have to think ""Why is that person doing that?"" You need to investigate.

9. Use common sense. 

So what do you have to add? Stories or insight?

Thanks and stay safe!",,False,self,t5_2ug10,False,,,True,t3_yheqx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/yheqx/notes_tips_tricks_and_reminders_for_discussion/,

1375243142.0,14,self.ProtectAndServe,1jee2x,Failed polygraph and branded a liar and cheater - now what?,polyfail,20,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1jee2x/failed_polygraph_and_branded_a_liar_and_cheater/,"Hello Officers of /r/ProtectAndServe, throwaway here. Long story below, I'm sorry about that. Just typing about it has helped me feel better, but the big question is: What now? I know the you lie, you die rule but in this case I didn't lie. I was as honest as I could be every step in the way, even admitting to what I guess was a countermeasure I was unintentionally doing. Is my career as a LEO dead before it began? Will this have an effect on future government jobs with clearances?

tl;dr: got nervous, focused on my breathing, admitted that i was focusing on my breathing, examiner failed me for using countermeasures and lying about drug usage (I didnt lie)

So after nearly a year of testing, applying, and all the other fun stuff that comes with applying for law enforcement, i was given the polygraph for a local department which i had had my eyes set on from the start.

Being it's my first poly, and having heard many stories about it throughout the years, i was fairly nervous but tried to keep calm and collected. We began the poly with the basic run down of the questions. The examiner then asked me a few control questions, and afterwards got up, left the room, and came back and had me count from one number to another backwards and in sets of three's while still connected to the machine. This helped ease my mind as I was focused on counting the entire time.

After the countdown, he told me to relax my breathing and asked me a series of questions, including ""do you intend to lie?"", ""have you lied on your background packet?"", and ""have you done any drugs other then marijuana (one time usage)?"". Throughout this entire process, I was extremely nervous and just focused on my breathing and singing songs in my head, trying to follow everyone's advice of not ""over-thinking it"" considering I was extremely nervous.

After the exam, he asked me why I was breathing so slowly. I told him I wasn't sure, and that it might be because I do SCUBA diving - a shitty joke with partial truth; I tend to have deeper breaths when I'm under stress. He asked me if I knew what countermeasures were, to which I honestly replied no, and he continued to explain that i was breathing deeply to try and beat the machine and that i was lying and would be disqualified. Regardless, he ran through the questions a second time.

Now, at this point I'm freaking out in my mind. He begins to run through the questions again, and now I'm focusing even more on my breathing, trying to breath faster since he thought my slow breathing was me consciously using a countermeasure. At the end of it, I said ""it's kind of weird forcing myself to breath faster"". He immediately said ""What'd you say?"", to which I told him ""It feels weird trying to breath faster"". He then had me write down what I said, left the room, and came back to inform me that I had admitted to using countermeasures on camera and was being disqualified.

The kicker of it is that he then proceeded to show me my results and tell me that I was also lying about drug usage. He then began to grill me, asking me what kinds of drug I used, and that lying would only make it worse. Apparently, I told the truth when he asked if I was intending to lie, and when I said no to ""did you leave anything intentionally off your background"", but was lying about using drugs.

I feel dirty. I'm a grown man with tons of experiences behind me, but when i got back to my car I couldn't help but shed a tear thinking about how I had just had my future career thrown away. I spoke to my BI shortly after to which she told me that ""the department doesn't hire liars and cheaters"", and that I won't be getting a second chance and my application would be dropped.

So as stated above, what now? Am I done for? I already spoke to my BI today when she told me she was dropping me, should I give her a call tomorrow to try to explain my position better? I feel defeated physically but mentally don't want to give up that easy.

I can't thank you guys enough for what you do, and if you made this far down, for reading the whole thing.

Waze doesnt give directions but it works with GPS apps.

What I havent figured out is some of the Wazers use Police Icons.  So it appears as if Wazers can somehow see the Police Cruisers drive around not just when they are stopped.

As you can see, we have somewhat expanded the sidebar.

At the top you will find a link to the popular video ""What Is A Policeman?"", truly a great description of our job.

Below it we have added a ""Recently fallen"" section. Here we will post the names, age and departments of recently fallen police officers.

We are still debating whether we will simply copy these from the ODMP, or if we only add the ones that get posted here. Personally, I lean more towards the second idea, because often people post news of fallen officers that they knew personally or that served in their community. By adding those to the sidebar, it has a more personal feel.

The links will be up for around 2 weeks to prevent overcrowding the sidebar.

And finally, we are going to add important links that are otherwise relevant to this subreddit. At the moment, I have posted the one about Nathan, the child that is fighting cancer and wishes for christmas cards from emergency personnel.

Tell us what you think!

Legally there is nothing we can do, being that it is a civil matter.

What should I do?,onish,23,10,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1jfzvm/failed_the_polygraph_just_got_word_that_i_will/,"I began this process at the beginning of this year. I applied to my number one department and slowly made my way through their requirements, until I reached the polygraph. I have never have had a polygraph test before and I was extremely nervous (the kind of nervous you get when you go to the doctors). Regardless I took the test and failed. Afterwards the interviewer grilled me about past drug abuse. She said that I was lying about never having done drugs even though I have never touched them in my life. 


Ever since I was young I knew I wanted to be a police officer, so throughout my life I stayed away from those types of things that could disqualify me from the job. The test however said otherwise. Needless to say she grilled me for 15 minutes or so. The whole time I just kept telling her that I had no idea why it said I was lying, because I was telling the truth. After she finished, I left and felt horrible. An extremely stressful month passed, not knowing if I would be moving on or not. That is, until last week, when they finally called me back. They wanted to set up a second polygraph since I was a ""good"" candidate almost ""too good"" as she said, which is why they think I was lying and needed to take another. 


So, a few days ago I went down and had the second test. It was focused mainly on lying in my background packet and past drug use/abuse. I was even more nervous this time because I knew that it was my last chance to move on in the application process and hopefully get the job of my dreams. The interviewer was a lot nicer this time, but kept saying that she thought I was lying because I really haven't done anything too bad in my past, which wasn't ""normal"". I took the test and was asked if there was anything else I'd like to say. I just reaffirmed to her that I was very nervous, before she let me leave. 


This brings me to today. A few hours ago I got an email saying I was not selected to move on. It was heartbreaking. After all this work I put into this whole process. I sat there and stared at the messaged for a few minutes. I can't believe its all over because of the polygraph. What hurts the most is that I didn't lie, and there is nothing I can do about it. Eventually I called up the police department to ask for details into why I failed. After a few minutes one of the Sergeants got on the phone and informed me that I failed because of the polygraph, but wouldn't specify why. It sounded as if he was upset that I wasted the whole departments time by hiding something and thus failing the test. I asked if I would be able to apply again to the department in the future and he informed me that I could but the first thing they would see is that I already failed their polygraph, which probably wouldn't turn out well for me. I thanked him for his time and got off the phone. Now, I'm not sure what I should do. I feel like such a failure, and that I let so many people down. I'm not looking forward to telling everyone that I didn't get in, especially since a lot of family friends are police offers themselves for this department. 


My question is, is it even worth it to apply to my number one department again? Let alone others? I know for a fact that I was telling the truth throughout the whole process. I just get really nervous when I take tests, especially ones that determine my future. Hell, even when I go to the doctors, the moment they start speaking, my blood pressure and heart-rate shoot through the roof. I don't know why it happens, it just does. I'm just concerned that if I apply for this department or another department, they will see that I already failed the test twice and may disqualify me without anymore consideration.

If you do, what's the set up like? Does it run with regular sirens, or is it something you have to turn on yourself?  Do you notice a difference in driver reaction to them?

We currently run Whelens with their standard three tone &amp; airhorns.  I tend to run code with the 'yelp'  and use air horn for intersection, while others run with the 'wail,' and switch to 'yelp' for intersections but we all agreed people just can't hear  a siren until you're right up behind them.  So these type of sirens really got us talking and I thought I'd ask around here.

I know what it's like on both sides of the fence. Even today, I'm guilty while running errands of not hearing an oncoming fire truck.  Once doing 60mph on the highway, I didn't hear one of my own rolling code somwhere until he was within 15yard of my personal vehicle.  I had to buy him coffee!

Is it harder for a woman to get hired as a police officer? (I have heard this before, I'm not sure about it, but I think its worth asking)

- college degree with a 4.0 GPA throughout my school career

- solid work history, such as a teacher, waitress and a midwife assistant

- volunteer positions at local shelters

- police officers willing to recommend me

- no citations or convictions. 

- very good demeanor, people skills and I carry myself well

- physically proficient, regularly whooping a County Deputy's ass in the boxing ring. A male one!

- excellent taste for donuts. 

-  100% LA Noire completion. I consider this to be my major selling point for the job. ",,False,self,t5_2ug10,1366002730.0,,,True,t3_1ccsee,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1ccsee/applying_to_become_a_police_officer_used_to_work/,
1365163195.0,10,self.ProtectAndServe,1bq7jh,From one recruit to other recruit/applicants. Tips and advice.,LeoHopeful99,16,6,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/ProtectAndServe/comments/1bq7jh/from_one_recruit_to_other_recruitapplicants_tips/,"Let me first say that, I hope there will be a FAQ section or list soon. It seems a lot of the post are quite repetitive lately. 

Anyways, I have been accepted to attend a police academy in one of the more popular cities in the south; I just want to share some tips and advice to other applicants. (This is how I feel, not all of R/ProtectAndServe)

**How long is the application process?** Typically 8 months at minimum in America.

**When should you apply?** Apply 6 months to a year before graduating college or leaving the military. This should help avoid sitting around for months on end waiting for a spot for the police academy

**What does the application process consist of?** It varies from department to department but on average: Agility test, Written test, Background check, Background interview, Panel/Board interview, Medical test, Written Psychological test, Psychological interview, Polygraph/CVSA, and a final review committee.

**What Degree or MOS should I have to become a officer?** I was once told, Major in a degree that you can work in and Minor in a degree that you love. I believe in getting any degree BUT a criminal justice degree, the reason being is that the application process is very rigorous and if you are not selected then you are left without a whole lot to fall back on. I personally have a CJ degree and think it is worthless if I was not accepted to a police academy. As for military, any MOS will work because it is not the job that you had but the experience you have from the military.

**What do I wear to interviews?** Other than the agility test, wear a suit and tie to everything no matter what! Written test? Suit and tie. Medical exam? Suit and tie. Polygraph/CVSA? Suit and tie.

**How should I prepare for the academy?** First off, Workout!! Secondly, study everything that you are given such as 10-codes, chain of command, etc etc. I was recently told to use flashcards or quizlet.com, it will seriously help so go try it.

Lastly **What questions will I be asked during interviews and the Polygraph/CVSA?** Basic questions, but exact questions? Every department ask different questions, so practice various questions and think of different scenarios they will ask you. For the Polygraph/CVSA, just be honest and hope for the best. I personally do not believe in the test, I have passed one and almost failed one. However, if you are looking for an edge or tips on how to pass the Polygraph/CVSA, you wont receive any from me. The test sucks and is nerve racking, but it is what it is. 

That is all I could think of off the top of my head. I hope this helps at least one person.

Location is in the USA, we are in different states. 
I am an online retailer (merchant). A customer paid $1000 with paypal on a credit card for goods that needed to be shipped on a pallet with a freight company. The customer lives in an apartment that could not accept this type of delivery. We agreed to ship it to the local freight terminal where he can pick it up. This is common practice in my industry. 

I ship the pallet and 2-3 days later receive notification that the paypal account holder and credit card holder reversed the charge stating that it was unauthorized use. 

I am not going to use real names, but The paypal account name is Homer Simpson and the confirmed shipping address name is Bart Simpson.  They bought the item through an ebay account holder name of Bart Simpson.  So Homer and Bart basically share the same ebay account and paypal account. 

After I thought about this for a while I thought back about 6 months ago to an order I received for the same item.  I received that order by phone and Bart Simpson was the one that ordered it.  About 4 hours later Marge Simpson called and said Bart was an dumbass and wasn't supposed to be ordering stuff and to cancel the order, which I did.  So I am sure this is common practice for Bart, Homer and Marge. 

So it seems like Bart is using Marge and Homers accounts. It also seems like they gave him access since Bart's ebay account is directly tied to Homer's paypal account. It isn't a new account either, it has over 100 feedback.


I called the freight terminal in Springfield and let them know what was going on. Sure enough Bart came to pickup the shipment.  I have a signed release for the merchandise, a photo copy of Bart's ID.  The tag number of the vehicle he was driving and possibly video surveillance (need to check on that). 

Will any detectives in springfield take this seriously?  Detectives in my city would, but springfield is in the Miami area so that is a much larger population than where I am. 

Homer is saying someone stole his credit card and Bart took delivery of the goods. If I have a police case paypal will reverse the charges.

I'm in the process of writing a novel, and I need your help. The story involves a small town in northern California, a substantial amount of missing persons, and a small cast of wayward heroes, including a police officer.

I don't know about you, but I hate it when someone doesn't have a good grasp of what they're writing about; unfortunately, right about now, that's me, and that's where you come in.

I'd like to find an officer as a consultant, making sure that the dynamic and procedure of the on-going mystery, and how the police handle it, is as close to how it would be handled in real life as possible. Your input would directly influence one of the main characters in the novel as they attempt to catch a killer.

In an attempt of full disclosure, there are negative aspects of Police and officers of the law that will come into light, though these are more reflective of the character of certain individuals, and not the position they hold; the officer that is part of the main cast of characters is a good person, and paramount to the ideology of protecting and serving - perhaps not the embodiment of the law, but the spirit of the law.

Anwyays, if someone is interested in this, please send me a PM - I'd be happy to discuss the finer details and get started.
