I want to say it has the word ""star"" in the title. Anyway, there are two opposing sides, one is the player, the other is the AI. Each player starts with 3 bases (2 small ones and one large). While each base will spawn units to go after the base, the player gets an avatar spaceship which he/she can use to focus attacks against an enemy base. The goal is to capture all the bases on the map, similar in concept to Tentacle Wars. In this game, after defeating an enemy, the player gets to upgrade the avatar, and the setup of the maps change (multiple AI's) more or less bases, more powerful units etc.

What makes this game easy to distinguish is its aesthetics. Unlike other space games, the background isn't black with stars, it is colored in somewhat vibrant colors, and the lasers that the units are shooting make fireworks almost.

It was an adventure/rpg where you start out by choosing a character from a farily large selection where there was a male and female for different nations. You distributed points to different abilites which included weapons specilizations, constitution, health, and some other stuff. When you entered the map you start in the nation the corresponds with the character you chose. I remember there being a desert/arabic nation, a samuri/japanese nation, a mongul inspired nation, and a few other ones. In the game you could hire troops and move on a map to conqure different towns. You could also complete quests for the towns like defeating bandits and delivering packages. In each town there was a town hall, barracks, a church, a blacksmith, and a stable. I also think the one I used to play was a sequal.

A few month ago I played a very addictive 2D flashgame. You were a warplane pilot over the sea and there were several enemy planes chasing and shooting at you. The color was nearly almost brown and the bullets were simple black dots. You could rotate on your own axis and for example let off the boost, rotate 180° and make it on again. Hopefully somebody recognizes it...

The cool thing though was that you could create your own boss space ships and share them with your friends and see if they could beat it.

Another thing I remember was that it was hosted on a canadian website (.ca), this probably has no significance though.

You could choose from a bunch of available races and as you won I think you could buy upgrades for your space-car.

On the racing tracks, you had the option to either race to the finish or be the last car rolling.

In addition to a damage bar, your car has an energy bar. Low energy makes you slower and (I think) more succeptable to damage. You gain energy by performing stunts. there was a button on your keyboard, maybe space but I can't emember, that lets your arrow keys spin or flip the car rather than accelerate/brake/steer when in in the air.

The game appeared in a pop-uip browser window, and I think the title had the word 'Ace' in it, though I might be wrong. The tagline was something along the lines of 'We are neer going to find the new unless we get a little crazy.'

I randomly remembered playing a pretty old game where the goal is to take over the entire board before your (computer) opponent does. The board was set up such that there were squares with arrows pointing in a direction, up/down/left/right, and this would create a 'connection' with the other squares. You would click on a square to rotate it, and it would point to a new square, link to it, and potentially get you a bunch more squares under your control.

I think the theme of this game was defending your computer against some virus or hacker or something, but maybe I just made that up. Also, I'm not entirely sure if it was flash or something else, so sorry if it wasn't flash.

First game: Cursed Treasure: Don't Touch My Gems!

Pros:
Alright, this has to be by far one of my favorite tower defense games EVER. The game can get a little confusing at times, but once you get the hang of it its a blast. A huge variety of upgradeable towers and enemies mixes the game up, and keeps it from getting boring. You start with thee basic tower choices, and after two upgrades, you can choose two different paths for your towers. You also have a mana system that allows you to cast three different spells. The variety of enemies keeps you on your toes and forces you to act strategically. Along with the in-game upgrades for our towers, you also earn general skill points that apply to every round. These upgrades include mana, starting money, tower damage, rapid fire, ect. What's also enjoyable is that your enemies have an actual goal. Instead of getting from point A to point B, they have to retrieve a gem, giving you a chance to fight them again. I could go on and on, but you'll just have to play it for yourself!

Cons:
There are a few elements that this game could use to make it smoother. The main one would have to be hot keys. You can use **shift** to place multipul towers and cast spells of the same type, but there are no hot keys for the different kinds of towers or upgrades. It would also be nice to be able to target certain enemies. At this point, your tower fire at the closest enemy, but it would be more effective for them to prioritize enemies that are carrying gems.

I'll try to be as specific as I can.

Game is/was on Newgrounds, probably put out there in the 2010-2011 time period +-1 year or so. It had a simple one or two word name, pertaining somewhat over what the game was about. Town or city or something close.


It was a simple game, and quite like King of Dragon Pass in many ways. Effectively you started a small town and could build more houses, mines, arenas, etc. You'd then 'recruit' soldiers of various races. Orc Beserkers, Human Gladiators, a troop type used exclusively for carrying goods (and many many more) and could research things to help you in your adventures like ropes and tents.


You'd then send these soldiers out on the world map to various areas. You could pay to have a person scout out to gauge the danger to some extent. Combat report was entirely text based and showed you how it went and if you succeeded, what you got from the area.

I remember the main issue about it being you couldn't save your progress.

As you eat parts of other shape-creatures you grow and deepen further into the games layers, where you face more complex enemies.
