That should be everyone, right? Good. Try this experiment. It's awesome.

Eat a fucking apple. 

No I'm not kidding. Go. Go now. Go to the nearest place where there's apples and get one. Eat it. 

Watch this shit.

**IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE A FUCK WHILE EATING AN APPLE**

I'm not kidding here. How do you eat an apple? You just fucking bite it. Where? Who the fuck cares where. You know where to bite. In the APPLE part. You chomp the fuck into that apple and you rip it the fuck apart.

Look at yourself. You're a god damned bad ass. The number of fucks you give is decreasing rapidly. 

Go for a walk. Apple in hand. Who looks at you? People? What do they think of you? Not a god damned thing. You're a dude eating an apple. Look at how you're standing. You're fucking chill. You know what? Strut. Strut like a pimp with an apple in your hand. Doesn't that feel good? No one cares. You're just a dude with an apple. You can fucking strut if you want to, and it feels fucking good.

You didn't have to peel shit. You didn't have to cook shit. You didn't have to do SHIT to enjoy this apple. All you did is grab it and comp like a fucking boss. How much are you going to eat? WHO THE FUCK CARES! You can chuck it after 4 bites or you could eat everything but the seeds and stem (seriously, [don't eat the seeds](http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/apples.asp)). It doesn't matter. You. Apple. Zero fucks. 

Try it. Go now. Quit reading Reddit and go eat an apple. Tell me you gave a fuck while you were eating that apple. You didn't. You felt like a boss. That's fucking science.

One day I hopped in a taxi and we took off for the airport. We were driving in the right lane when suddenly a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us. 

My taxi driver slammed on his brakes, skidded, and missed the other car by just inches! The owner of the other car whipped his head around and started yelling at us. 

My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. And I mean, he was really friendly. So I asked, ""Why did you just do that? This guy could almost ruin your car and sent us to the hospital!""

This is when my taxi driver taught me what I now call, 'The Law of the Garbage Truck.'

He explained that many people are like garbage trucks. They run around full of garbage, full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment. As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump it and sometimes they'll dump it on you. Don't take it personally. Just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on.

Don't take their garbage and spread it to other people at work, at home, or on the streets.

Life's too short to wake up in the morning with regrets.

So... Love the people who treat you right. Pray for the ones who don't. 

Life is ten percent what you make it and ninety percent how you take it!

EDIT: I did not consider this quote to be referring to clinical depression. The word depression is used for a number of different things nowadays, and when posting I took this use of depressed to represent backward looking wallowing; inverse worry. I have spent many hours of my life feeling 'depressed' about poor decisions and what not. We all have. This is what I read it as.

Depressed - read as; feeling downhearted. Anxious - read as; worrying.

EDIT 2: I don't even know who Lao Tzu is supposed to be. I didn't post this as some sort of historical treatise on his genius; it doesn't matter who said it, the point is the sentiment behind the words.

I can't believe, in this subreddit of all places, so many people have got their knickers in a twist because they don't realise that the words 'depressed' and 'anxious' don't actually always refer to the medical conditions.

I've been doing a lot of thinking lately and decided to compile all my realizations into a list to remind myself of these things every day. They're pretty much the mantras I use to help me cope with daily life. Just thought they might help someone else out too :)

1. IMPENDING DEATH: Think about the imminence of death. Nothing really matters. Time is the most precious commodity. Focus on the most important things. 


2. PERSPECTIVE: Think about how lucky you are to be in this instance of the universe, to be in this country, to be at this socioeconomic level, to be in this moment. 


3. PRESENCE: Remember that there is only now. Be aware of it, be present, enjoy the experience - even if it is difficult. Feel emotional pain - don't resist. Separate analytic thought as a project and think of it at a predetermined time. Recognize that you have the power to decide not to feel an emotion. Fear is an illusion.  


4. AWARENESS: Be aware of your emotions and thoughts and recognize how your AWARENESS is separate.

 
5. HUMOUR: Remember to laugh. Take the humorous route. Don't take things too seriously. 


6. SELF-ASSUREDNESS: Remember that you know yourself, and you have nothing to prove to anyone. You are who you are. Nothing anyone says can change that. Nobody can make you feel anything with their words. The only person who can fix you is you. All you have is you. This is true freedom. 


7. EGO: Take nothing personally. Recognize your ego. Remember the seven deadly sins. Realize your insignificance in the universe. Forget the need to feel special. Stop identifying with labels. Stop seeking approval. Ask if your negative comments or actions are coming from a place of fear and anger. 


8. PATIENCE: Recognize that everyone and everything is created and driven by the universe and what happened previously. Realize this is what is. Remember the child self and the higher order thinking self. Be patient with people and yourself. Realize that you can't always know now. Realize that you can't control ignorant opinions and they are not personal. 


9. OUTROSPECTION: Look outwards. Listen. Watch people. Learn about them. Ask them questions. (this might mean turning the focus of an argument onto them - i have trouble with this)


10. ACCEPTANCE: This life was not made to happen in your favour, so do not impose your own expectations upon it. Nothing belongs to you. There is no cheat sheet to life, and just accept that there will be ups and downs. Accept confusion - the world cannot be deduced to dichotomies and simple categories. 


11. BALANCE: Pursue moderation and maintenance in every aspect of life. Take care of yourself. 


12. WILLPOWER: Recognize that your will is incredibly powerful. Just DO IT.  


13. ENERGY: Put out good energy into the world. Try to reduce suffering. Don't forget to do what you love and do what feels good.

It wasn't really love at first sight, more like second or third. We dated off and on for about 3 months, and after that cycled between best friends, not talking, and hooking up. Lately we've settled into best friends for an extended period of time but my feelings for her haven't diminished a bit. We're completely open with each other about the state of my feelings and things of that nature, so we talk about it a lot. Tonight we were talking about it, and I stumbled upon this subreddit and started reading people's posts. This led me to the following revelation:


I am better than stooping to the level of trying to change what someone wants.

I am better than trying desperately to convince someone they love me. I am better than trying to convince myself someone loves me.

I do not need to subject myself to constant, perpetual rejection, and I sure as hell do not need to deal with the amount of stress it causes me.

So today I will stop.

I will stop thinking ""how can I make Lauren love me today?""

I will stop believing every touch or smile or look means she has finally ""come to her senses.""

I will stop allowing her to cuddle with me because she is cold when that cuddling means something completely different to me. 

I will stop judging myself through the lens of unrequited love.

Her feelings towards me do not reflect my character whatsoever. Her feelings towards me do not reflect her character whatsoever. 

They reflect only her desires, and that those desires do not include me. 

I will stop trying to shape her desires to include me, and I will stop trying to shape myself to include her desires. 

I will stop allowing myself to become angry that she does not love me. This includes anger towards God/The universe, anger towards Lauren, and most importantly, anger towards myself.

I will stop giving a fuck that Lauren does not love me.

And I will go find someone who does.

There's some guy in the men's bathroom. Figure I'll wait it out cause I didn't see any other gas stations or food places nearby. There was a queue of a couple guys behind me waiting to go. There's one lady waiting for the women's bathroom.

Pressure increases. I know I don't have much time. The woman who was waiting gets a chance to relieve herself. At this point I knock on the men's door -- no response.

FUCK! I've given up hope on the guy who's trying to shit a tree trunk. Or jerking off.

The woman leaves the bathroom, and I run in, to her surprise.

Take the best shit of my entire life. Logs upon logs upon logs. When I leave, I see there are women queued up. 

I say, ""cheers"" and go on my way.

A psychologist walked around a room while teaching stress management to an audience. As she raised a glass of water, everyone expected they'd be asked the ""half empty or half full"" question. Instead, with a smile on her face, she inquired: ""How heavy is this glass of water?""

Answers called out ranged from 8 oz. to 20 oz.

She replied, ""The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes."" She continued, ""The stresses and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt. And if you think about them all day long, you will feel paralyzed – incapable of doing anything.""

My battle with social anxiety is far from over, but I have had some realisations over the past few months which I hope might serve as advice. Or it might just be all what you've heard before, only one way to find out. Feel free to add to this.      

1. Most people care more about themselves more than you - the only person who has an issue with you is you.      

2. No one likes an overly self-absorbed person. Take an interest in others, social anxiety is self-consciousness and self-consciousnesses is caring about yourself too damn much.      

3. If you start to feel awkward with someone, ask them a question, it gives you some time and a chance to sit back and listen, it also tells them you're interested - remember, eye contact.      

4. Smile. For fuck sake, smile, all the time. Happiness breeds happiness and people will like being around you if you're happy.      

5. Life begins beyond your comfort zone - take this as literally as possible.            

6. Do something for someone every day. Offer them an Oreo, take the rubbish out for your Mom without asking, help the old lady reach the can of beans on the top shelf, make someone smile. Anything, it'll make you feel better about yourself, and that means - confidence.      

7. Remember, everyone is fundamentally the same. That guy who you wish you were, he's got the same problems you do, he just has a different way of dealing with them.      

8. Do whatever makes you happy - sounds simple right? I bet you're not doing it though.      

9. Think less, do more. Let me guess, you think your way of doing things you know will be worth it - try to work on doing something as soon as you think of it. Trust me, you can think your way out of anything if you think hard enough.      

10. Learn to be happy with yourself. Check yourself in the mirror, give yourself a thumbs up - remember, you're just as awesome as anyone else. Spread your wings and fly.

They are the same steps that you can take to happiness... so yes, NGAF and happiness can be the same thing. Anyways, here are the steps:

1. **Love yourself** a.k.a. learn to accept yourself for what you are. You are the one and only person that you have to spend your entire life with, so you better start liking yourself, or you are going to be in for one hell of a life. There are some things about you that you just can't change. Love those things. They make you ""you"". If you can't love yourself, who can? You are great. You are awesome. Don't let others opinions get in the way of what you think about yourself.

2. **Stop judging others** once you love yourself, this will become easier. Seriously, who cares about anyone else. You need to focus on yourself. Do you have to spend the rest of your life with all these other people around you? No. So leave them alone. You are your business. Other people are NOT your business.

3. **Stop worrying about what other people think about you** remember when all you did was worry about others opinions? Well that's exactly how everyone else is. They are too busy worrying about what everyone else thinks, to think for themselves. Seriously. And for the few that will judge you, who cares what they think? How important are they to your life? They aren't. I don't care who they are, they aren't important to you. Your dad? how is he stopping you from doing whatever you want. HE ISN'T! Get it out of your head that other people stand in your way. THEY DON'T! Seriously, the only opinion that affects your life, is YOURS. Bottom line for this one WHO CARES WHAT PEOPLE THINK. I cannot stress that enough. It's something you'll have to learn on your own though... that no matter what people think about you, you can still do whatever you want to do.

4. **Be a decent person** This step really isn't necessary, but you won't get anywhere without it. You NEED to be nice to people. Remember how you aren't judging anyone? That guy who cut you off in traffic... maybe his wife is in labor. The homeless guy at the park... maybe he lost everything in a fire. You don't know people, so you need to not assume anything about them, and treat them like you would treat yourself. This may also be the hardest step by the way... but you can do it.

I think that's it... if I think of any more I will come back for an edit... if someone would like to add, then I will edit if I think it's relevant.

**EDIT**: I did think of something else to add... 

**Remember that you can't please everyone**. Yes, that's pretty commonly known. You will never please everyone. You cannot make everyone happy. But do you know what you can do? You can make yourself happy. That's right, you can please yourself (I'm not talking about the sexual way you perverts). Stop trying to do things so others will smile, or be happy for you. Stop trying to make other people's life's better. You'll never succeed. Instead, focus on making your life better, and making yourself happy. *TIP*: Happiness is a choice. Now that you know that, every time you are sad, you are doing it on purpose. You choose to be happy from now on. And don't give yourself some BS excuse about clinical depression... I battled through depression, and I now go everywhere with the motherfuckingest big smile on my face. I smile because I enjoy being happy.

Social norms dictate you're a creep if you approach a woman in the wrong way at the cafe, the store, where ever. Why should it matter so much?

If I make a mistake and act creepy, the girl has a right to walk away or tell me to go away. Net loss? Nothing.

If I am successful, I got a good conversation, maybe a friend, maybe a date. Net gain? A lot and I made some other person's day.

Even with failure after failure, it truly does not matter.

Zero fucks given.,vleebs,728,156,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/174sd0/ex_brings_porn_star_girlfriend_to_house_zero/,"So I've lived the past three months of my life in the most amazing mode of NGAF. I stopped giving a shit about what other people think about me, got rid of a bunch of bullshit baggage, quit drinking, and earned a 3.91 GPA. Whenever I find myself saying something awkward or doing something strange, I remember it won't matter by next week and FUCK I'm a strange lady, and that's the best thing about me. Life is way easier single and NGAF. 

So naturally it surprises me that everyone still asks me about my ex all the time and stuff. Maybe it's because I reacted to the situation before I learned to handle with emotional issues productively, so my depressed little ass was just mad drunk all the time. And this isn't really surprising retrospectively, given that when I was with my ex I drank on his off nights as well as my own and now my escapist drunky-brain was trying to compensate for drinking less times a week by pounding mad jaegar to the dome. 

Anyway, he brings this chick over to our balcony for beer pong on a tuesday night when my roommates and I are about ready to go to bed. But there's a bunch of people over and there's enough beer so why not. Anyway, inside some of our friends were talking about this chick. I didn't even know her name for like the first hour and a half because everyone referred to her as ""benzoid"" or ""barbie"" or ""ratchet"". 

It's this girl named Jenna -I finally meet her when I get outside- and I feel that beautiful reflective clarity of not giving a fuck. I see her and think about how months ago I would have been intimidated and insecure about seeing an ex with a tall, thin, flirtatious girl. But honestly, I couldn't give half of two shits. She looked crazy in her white minidress and six and a half inch heels, wobbling on the cobblestones. 

And that just made me realize how ridiculous the whole thing was, and how I should never allow myself to get hung up on people from the past. Of course you could call this girl attractive. But I don't want to attract that kind of boy. As far as I'm concerned, the kind of guy I would like to have in my life would rather see me in yoga pants and a jacket when it's cold out than see me like that. The kind of guy I would like to have in my life would say ""fuck beer pong, let's go inside and play video games until our eyes bleed"". And then we would. 

AND UNTIL THAT HUMAN BEING EXISTS there's no reason to mourn them and feel forever alone because my ex is dating someone new. It's only a matter of time until I meet someone awesome because I kick ass and I'm going to make it somewhere in life. And since that's inevitable, I only have a set amount of time to be single and fuck around and straight work on improving myself. So why not take advantage of that time?

Hello, reddit. I'm a girl who doesn't wait for guys to ask her out. Unfortunately, that results in a lot of rejection.

For the past week, I've been interested in this guy (we're both college freshmen). I'm getting a lot of positive signals (teasing, walking with me, offering to help), but when I ask him to hang out, he's always busy. No, he's actually busy. Regardless, I have a feeling that he's just not that interested, but I, like y'all, officially give zero fucks.

**I fucking hate half-assed rejection and the nagging thought of, ""What if?"" So I'm going to tell him for real that I'm interested in him. Today. Or tomorrow, if I don't see him today. And you know what I'm going to if he says no? I'm going to update you guys and give zero fucks and have zero regrets. Then I'm going to go hang out with friends and be grateful that I have any at all.**

Here's some advice for anyone in a similar situation. We're all going to grow old and die and decompose, and in the end, nobody's going to be thinking, ""Wow, that girl is such a loser for asking that guy out."" Nobody's even going to remember it. So fucking do it, and don't you ever, even for a second, regret having the courage to tell someone how you feel. A lot of people never will.",,False,,t5_2tna8,1348886319.0,,,True,t3_10kl20,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/10kl20/i_stopped_giving_a_fuck_about_rejection_and_im/,

5 Months ago I met and started dating the girl of my dreams.
4 Months ago, we broke up. The school year had ended and we were unable to see each other because we live so far away, and both work full time in the summer. 

My downhill spiral lasted about a week. I was distraught. My cigarette consumption doubled. I gained weight. I was depressed.
But then, one morning, something changed. 

I honestly can't explain the reason for my sudden and dramatic change in my personal philosophy, but it did a complete 180 in a single day.
I hadn't discovered this sub yet, but essentially, I decided I was going to do anything and everything, my reasoning being: ""Why not""

Instead of moping around and feeling sorry for myself, I simply did random shit, and learned how to give less fucks along the way. Some of these things are pointless, while others, I'm incredibly proud of. 

Here's what I accomplished this summer:

- I began the practice of waking up every morning and looking in the mirror, flexing my muscles, and giving myself a huge smile.
- Quit Cigarettes
- Quit Dipping (I was a big fan of nicotine)
- Built an exact replica lifeguard stand in my backyard 
- Started spear fishing
- Woke up at 4am 6 days a week to run before work (I love it so much I just signed up for a half marathon)
- Trained myself to enjoy a glass of whiskey
- Randomly bought a plane ticket San Francisco (I'm from New Jersey) and made zero plans about where I would stay or what I would do while there. 
- Got a ridiculous looking Mohawk
- Stopped drinking alcohol for a month 
- Stopped trees for a month
- Deleted my Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram
- Quit drinking soda (I would have 3 Diet Mountain Dews a day previous to this)
- Completely changed my diet 
- Started flossing and brushing my teeth twice a day (I was inconsistent at this for a long time)
- Once a week I would go to a local bar by myself, (A new location each week) have a few beers, and dinner.
- Became more patient by forcing myself to wait for things I wanted

I have become much more proficient at not giving any fucks, but there is one fuck that I still give, and won't stop giving by any choice of mine, and that is this girl. (no pun intended) 

In one hour I'm seeing her for the first time in 4 months. Wish me luck brothers. I know giving a fuck about her is essentially against the core beliefs of this community, but I am willing to sacrifice all fucks I currently give for her.

P.S.

The three most important things I did this summer are smiling at myself in the morning, deleting my social media, and going out to eat alone.

Smiling at yourself in the morning is absolutely incredible. Try it, you'll laugh just because of the idea of you smiling at yourself, and you immediately begin your day in a good mood.

Social media makes you give fucks about people you shouldn't be giving any fucks to. I would like to go into this further, but I'm stressed for time. 

When you go out to eat alone, you can either sit somberly and eavesdrop, or start up a conversation with a random person. Both of these are great practice for not giving fucks, you become more comfortable doing something by yourself, and being able to hold a conversation with random people is crucial in life. 



**EDIT:** Thanks for all the support, encouragement is always so helpful. Things went well, I'm not going to go into the minutia of it all, but I have a very good feeling about the situation, only time will tell I guess. However, Sillyminion made me realize that I don't have total control of this situation. I definitely have SOME, but in the end I cannot decide what will happen, so I'm going to approach the situation with caution, and try to focus on the things I CAN control.

Everyone's advice has been very thought provoking. I'm going to spend some time focusing on the rest of the unimportant things in my life, and find out what those are, so I can put a fuck embargo on all of them as well.

We said hi to every bartender there, and proceeded to play pool against the sharks that are regulars there. 

During one of my games, some guy came in acting ""alpha."" He proceeded to hit on my friend's sister. She, being raised by 3 guys (her brother, my brother, and me), knows how to take care of herself. She gave him the cold shoulder and one word responses when needed. He kept going. Every time he would leave, she would look at me like ""fuck, this guy doesn't get it."" 

Her brother and I were keeping a close eye on the situation. He came back one last time, and finally asked who she was with. She pointed at me. He wanted to introduce himself. I said hi and said, ""just so you know, she has a bf. So you can stop hitting on her now."" Alpha didn't appreciate this comment. He started getting loud, and saying ""I had no right to speak for her."" ""All I am is friend. Let her speak for herself."" ""This isn't Afghanistan."" He kept talking for about 5-10 minutes, with me barely listening. He continued by asking, ""where is your gf... oh sorry... bf?"" I didn't appreciate this, so I told him the conversation was over, and turned my head. Alpha again didn't appreciate this. He began yelling, and saying we could take it outside. I said no and continued to ignore him. Alpha continued to get loud. Little did he know that I was a regular, and at this point the bartender told him to leave.

When the whole deal was over, I apologized to everyone. Someone who was sitting across from me (watching the whole thing) told me, ""I have never seen anyone with as much patience as you."" Another regular said, ""I have seen guys a lot smaller than you, fight for a lot less. I don't know how you controlled your temper.""

A user named [Mumberthrax](http://www.reddit.com/user/Mumberthrax) replied with a really mind-blowing answer; I think that it can be useful to a lot of people here, so I quote it below.


&gt;Make a conscious decision not to take anything personally.
Everyone has their own idea of what the world is, about who they are and who everyone else is and what is going on, based on their personal beliefs. Each individual has their own specific idea of reality, their own filtered image, or flavor or interpretation. To each one of us, everything IS the way we see it to be, regardless of what anyone else sees.
&gt;
&gt;So everyone sees the world differently, and it's all based on their own personal beliefs. Beliefs they've chosen consciously or unconsciously completely independent of your actions.
&gt;
&gt;If you pass by a stranger walking down the street and they say to you with very sour grimace, ""I really hate your purple and orange socks!"" you'll likely look at them in a very confused and curious way because you aren't wearing socks like that, you don't even own any socks other than plain white ones. This is an extreme example, but it demonstrates the principle: each person is seeing and judging the world around them based on their personal beliefs. You have no obligation to share their model of reality.
&gt;
&gt;Whenever someone comes to you like the purple sock person does and offers a model of reality, a belief system, to share with you, you can either accept it and integrate it and say ""damn, he's right these socks are really revolting. I'm a terrible person for even thinking of wearing them"", or you can say ""no thanks"" and continue choosing your own way of defining reality.
&gt;
&gt;The point I'm trying to make is that when someone is judging you they are doing so not because you have any sincere reason to feel shame or guilt or embarrassment, but because they have a set of beliefs in their mind completely separate from yours, and you have no responsibility to agree with their beliefs or their model of reality. It isn't personal. It's not about you, it's about them.
&gt;
&gt;This doesn't mean you are always right and everyone who disagrees with you is always wrong. It doesn't mean you should go and commit genocide and say FU to everyone who wants you to go to prison. You're still responsible for acting in line with your morals, with your beliefs about desirable conduct. This is part of a larger path of transformation involving self-honesty, self-love, and self-empowerment.
&gt;
&gt;Same idea applies to positive feedback. When people say ""oh Jaja1990, you're so cute!"" or ""Wow that was a really kind thing for you to do"", etc. These things, too, are not really because of you. They say these things because their own model of reality causes them to. You know you are a kind person and you don't have to have someone else tell you so in order to feel good about yourself. You can agree with them and share in that appreciation of yourself, but don't fall into the trap of believing that you need validation from others. You're like two traveling strangers whose paths momentarily coincide. You can enjoy each others' company, but you aren't going on that path just because they are - you were already on it.
&gt;
&gt;One thing you could do is try to take stock of the underlying beliefs you have regarding the instances where you find yourself obsessing over others' opinions. Pull out a new journal and make it just for this project. Start writing down how you're feeling over specific circumstances, and always ask yourself ""why"". Just writing with the intent to discover the truth will produce some decent results and empowering information that you might not have been consciously aware of previously. If you can discern some underlying beliefs governing this anxiety/fear/obsession then you can decide if you think they're ones you want to continue to hold onto, or if it's time to let them go. (and of course by let them go, I don't mean forget them and pretend they never existed because then you're just being dishonest with yourself. I mean view them as part of a dialectic where they are one part of a synthesis with your other beliefs about being kind to yourself or being a more awesome person, and the resulting product is a more empowering belief or set of beliefs)",Advice,False,,t5_2tna8,1350977263.0,advice,,True,t3_11xovp,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/11xovp/and_heres_why_you_should_not_give_a_fuck_about/,

That happens to me all the time.  I recently realized my constant judgment of people is basically a state of mind that I live in that makes it much easier for me to judge myself.

Nothing came of it and I'm alright with that (She didn't answer my texts and eventually told me she was too busy for a relationship, I get the hint). So last Tuesday she went to Trivia at the pub and practically begged me to go to a different bar with her and some other dudes for margaritas. Eventually I relent. We all drank and talked for way too long and at the end of the night she ends up leaving with one of the other dudes. This kinda pissed me off at the time mostly because I had to drive home buzzed when I originally didn't even want to stay out, let alone drink. Anyway, I go to trivia yesterday and she says ""I bet you hate me now"" and I shrug it off. Literally went ""eh"" and shrugged. I really don't mind. Seriously, things didn't work out after our date, and she likes someone else, I am totally cool with that. So the guys and I are talking for a bit and she keeps trying to make conversation with us but mostly with me. Now, I wasnt an asshole. I was polite, but I really have no interest on the girl. I didn't really think much of it, just all of us hanging out answering inane questions. After about 15 minutes, she got up and left in a huff. The guys were a bit confused because the game had just started. We weren't even on the third round! But I knew exactly what happened. She wanted a reaction out of me, and since I DGAF she got pissed. She wanted attention and when she didn't get it, she got angry and left.

I'm a little sad because I know this means that her insecurities got the best of her, but I like having my sanity much more.

The quote itself isn't much, but it got me to thinking more.

I used to be (still am to a point but getting much better) a person who cared what EVERYONE thought of me.  But then I started asking myself why I did.  When I rationally broke it down I realized it's really all about leverage.  People will have no control over you if you don't want anything from them.  When I did this I realized there were a lot of instances where I gave a fuck about something when I didn't even want anything from them.  I was giving these people control of me for no reason whatsoever.  So in those instances (like when a person I work with is being a douche) I say to them inside my head, ""You have nothing to threaten me with.""  I need nothing from them and at that point all fucks go away.  Just like the Joker, I can be cool and content despite someone yelling at me or being rude.

It should be noted these people don't really threaten me.  It's more inside my head as a result of insecurities and the like.  When you have no self-esteem every negative (or sometimes even neutral) comment feels like a threat to who you are as a person.  It's only meant as a way to put yourself into a more carefree state.

Us, the worrieries, are really god damn good at worrying. This is because we have a LOT of practice with worrying. We keep repeating the troublesome thoughts in our head, over and over. We're rehearsing the idea, repeating it, and keep running it through our minds.

There is an opposite effect that could be happening instead. We continue to rehearse, repeat and run it through our mind, but instead of focusing on the negatives(the worry, the fears, the problems) we focus on the ""hope"" or ""confidence"" (look at the positives of the situation, look at what you learned) then our problems will melt away.
You just need to change the focus of your thoughts.
We need to realize that our human worth is infinite and complete because we exist, we need to resist falling into the mindset that so many corporations want us to be in, of needing external stimuli to feel complete.

The fact that you are alive is reason enough to celebrate, just focus on the positives of life instead of the negatives, we will enjoy our time on earth that much more.

Mostly because judgement is almost done subconsciously without any direct attention to it. Yeah, we know what we are thinking about someone, but we disregard it like it has no effect on ourselves. On the contrary, it has a massive effect on us. 

Have you ever wondered the reason for your self consciousness? Why you care about what people think of you? Why you care about shit that truly does not matter? Fear. Pure fear that is directly derived from ego. 

You can be shyest motherfucker on this earth and have an ego bigger than holy hell. How? Because ego is a sense of self directly derived from the comparison of others to you. Ego is not confidence, ego is an unhealthy illusion that is counterproductive as fuck.

***This*** **is an example of confidence**

You yourself, are a badass, and you need **NO ONE** else to validate that for you. You don't need anyone to be a benchmark for your success in life. Fuck that shit. No one knows you like you know yourself, and a major key to not giving a fuck, is the realization that people's understanding of who you are and what you're about **DOES NOT MATTER**.

**How do you lose an ego?**

Stop judging. I myself struggle with this. A lot. And my tone throughout this text was not meant to appear like I have this shit down, but rather to share an epiphany from a progressing honey badger.

I am doing things day by day that help me personally with counterproductive thoughts. 

The next time you catch yourself thinking something along lines of, ""That girl is a bitch."" or ""What a tool."", say something that is degrading to yourself. Yes. Degrading. This will train your mind that this kind of negative thinking does not help, but rather induces more fear or anxiety of how others perceive **YOU**. It triggers fear, not at that moment, but very subtly in your subconsciousness. I'm not saying the reason that you *do* give a fuck for how people perceive you is ***all*** due to your judgment on others, but it is a huge part of the problem.

When I catch myself in the act, I say something like ""Stop that, you pussy."" Or ""What the fuck are you doing? This is part of your problem.""

Try this. I guarantee that once you lose the necessity to judge others, it will help you lose the care that is holding you back from being **YOU**. Not only that, you will have soooooooooo much more time for doing the things that you love and you just won't give a fuck. Why?

It's hard to change your whole worldview. I started by writing down ""good advice"" for myself. I find it helps to write it in the 2nd person: ""You should be proud of your accomplishments,"" instead if ""I should be.""

This is not a subreddit to brag about how you are one hardcore motherfucker, cool as a cucumber and completely fuckless. That's not how it works. If you don't give a fuck, great, help someone else learn to let go, but if you're going on about how few fucks you give, you're obviously trying way too hard. 

Not giving a fuck is an acceptance of the way things are. Sunny outside? Cool, I don't give a fuck. Raining outside? Still don't give a fuck. It is seeing the world as a level headed calm individual. Nothing surprises you, you don't give a fuck. Just let go, breathe, and accept that nothing is the end of the world. You're gonna be okay. Rubbing ice cream on yourself like a shitstained fuckwit is NOT not giving a fuck. I'm sorry. Not giving a fuck is accepting that the world is a fucked up place, and doing your best to be happy in it. So, HTNGAF, I don't give a fuck that you're fucking your ex, I don't give a fuck that you acted dumb in public, and you shouldn't either. Let go of this idea that you can change the way things are, and just let things be. THAT is what it means to not give a fuck.  

Honeybadger out. 

tl;dr: Fuck you, read it.

",bloodbag,492,63,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/x6s08/how_i_said_fuck_it_to_my_issues_and_anxiety_and/,"Step back six months, I would not talk to a random girl, when I did have a girlfriend, I would be a pathetic snivelling boyfriend who said sorry every time I thought I had upset her. I had no self-esteem when it came to achieving at work, I looked around and thought “how am I ever going to reach the level of these people around me? How can I even begin to comprehend the idea of being a team leader/manager?”. I volunteer with an emergency services department, and I could do most of what I needed, but never thought I could get to the level of the people above.




Last night I finished running my first training session (that I organised) for 16 people, with every single person looking to me for direction and leadership, when I asked someone a question, I saw them stumble on their own words when the didn't know the answer and I could see myself from six months ago in them. 

I have made the move on several girls, and while I didn't get anywhere with any of them (most due to boyfriends) I did say “fuck it” and went over and talked to them, and for the most part, I was doing fantastic, I was talking to them, I had plenty to say, and I came across as interesting. I will no longer be held back in doing what I want, because FUCK IT! I WANT IT! And when I used to feel I had to say sorry for every situation that occurred, guess what? She was dating me because she liked me, we could have a fight, she could be pissed at me, and I could of walked away, I could of let her spend a day pissed at me, and guess what, she would not of left me, because she wanted to be with me and make it work. I am not saying be a cunt, but be realistic, stand your ground when you should, if you mean anything to her, she will fight just as hard to keep you, so don't stress about losing her, FUCK IT! 

I stepped up at work, and said to myself “I can do this”. I just received my yearly review, met every requirement across the company, and told I was well above average compared to others. I have stepped up and delegated to people in higher positions than me, as well as taking the initiative to teach people when the opportunity presents itself. You know why? FUCK IT! I can be better than everyone around me, without really trying that much harder.




You know what the major thing was that changed all this? I looked around, I saw the people I thought were above me, the ones asking girls, and the ones who were leaders, and realised that as long as I know what I am doing, I can be just as good, if not better than them, because most of them really don't know what they are doing! These are all people who looked at a situation, and thought “fuck it, I can step up and do this, even if I'm not perfect, I can do it”. Look around you, at the people in the highest positions – government politicians, oil company managers and the CEO – how many of these people really seem to know what they are doing? If they knew, they wouldn't fuck up as much as they do, they wouldn't fucking spill oil across the ocean. These people saw an opportunity to grow their career, said “fuck it” and went for it, and we believe they are the best person for the job, and don't think we could do it, yes we fucking can.




Guess what, you can do it too, if you can do anything to a level that's acceptable, then you can step up and make that situation your own. If you can talk to a person, you can talk to a girl, step up, doesn't matter if you don't know everything, fuck it! Just do it. Working your job and can the job? Guess what, you can easily step up beyond everyone else around you, by simply saying “fuck it, I'll give it a go, because I can do this better than these people around me”

I then proceeded to jump over the make-shift blockade (pretty sure you had to pay, but I didn't care), found the first dance circle, jumped right in the center, howled to the moon, and poured my entire water bottle all over my already sweaty body.

My and a buddy were absolutely destroying at beer pong, and quite a few people were impressed.  When I went outside to smoke a cig after winning a few games in a row, a girl stepped outside at the same time to smoke a cig also.  We started chatting and hit it off.  We spent the rest of the party hanging out and joking and all that shit.  I got her cellphone number.  For the next week we were chatting and despite her living an hour and a half away, I asked her out on a date.  She said yes.  Yesterday was the date.  I drove the hour and a half, took her out to a pizza place in her area and did the typical date stuff.  She invited me back to her apartment where we figured out we like alotta the same tv shows and music.  We sat around and watched tv and drank a few beers, while cuddling and making out a little.  Before I left to head home, I told her that I liked her and wanna take her out on a regular basis.  She told me that this was the best date she went on in the past 3 years and she would absolutely wanna go out again.  I texted her today, and she didn't get back to me yet, but what the fuck ever, we all have our own shit we need to do.  Now, many of you are probably like, ""So what?  That sounds like just your typical date."" but heres the beauty of it all.  Until recently, I was painfully shy and awkward.  I looked at alotta shit on this subreddit, and thought hard about it and realized that if you want something, you just need to go for it.  The outcome doesn't matter.  Theres always the possibility of a bad outcome, but theres no chance of a good outcome if you never try.

tl; dr - Went to a party as a honey badger.  Went on a date with a girl from said party as a honey badger.  Didn't worry about how the date would turn out, I just was myself and was honest.  It worked out so well.  Thanks for the help r/howtonotgiveafuck

While I usually refrain from posting on this sub (because of the high number of posters already voicing just about every opinion I could have before me), this is something that needs to be said. 

Not giving a fuck is a great life skill. When that asshole cuts you off on the way to work, don't give a fuck. When one of your co-workers makes a joke at your expense, don't give a fuck. When you get home and realize that the dog got into the meat you were thawing to cook and you have to change your plans, don't give a fuck.

In essence, this philosophy, as well as this whole sub-reddit of ideas, could also be worded as ""Don't Sweat The Small Shit."" 

I say that because of a specific reason. Sometimes, you have to give a fuck about something. If someone close to you passes away, you should give a fuck. If your SO cheats on you, you should give a fuck. If John G comes to rape and murder your family, you should give a fuck.

Why? Because not giving a fuck when something extremely detrimental happens to you or people you care about makes you a narcissistic asshole. Because any mental health professional would state that you naturally not caring about these life changing events is extremely unhealthy. Because you have a life and should give a fuck when something out of your control significantly changes the status quo.

I'm not the founder of this idea. I'm not the most active member on this board by a longshot, and I have no right to say what is and is not the ideal of not giving a fuck. But, as someone who somewhat cares about random internet strangers, I want you to know that trying to put aside that pain and not deal with it will kill you inside. 

When you've dealt with that pain for some time, and need to get over it so that you can function normally, then not giving a fuck is a great option. When you're ready to move on, we'll be here. But until then, quit running away from your problems under the guise of ""Not Giving A Fuck"" and realize that being hurt after something really bad happens to you is not only natural, but part of the healing process that cannot be skipped.

Downvote me to oblivion, because I don't give a fuck about stupid internet points. I do care about you going through the stages of grief after shit hits the fan so that you can move on with your life and eventually not give a fuck. 

Until then, don't let the skinny bitch ahead of you in line (who just *can't* decide what she wants) or the traffic on the way to work ruin your day. You're too awesome to let stupid people fuck your shit.

My name is Loegan. I will be doing my absolute best to portray how I have been coping with dumb shit from my life that really gets me down. First, let's define what a 'nice-guy' is.

Well, as I am sure you can imagine, a nice guy is that guy you see in all of those rom-com movies. What girls would describe as the perfect guy, you know, besides the rocking abs and beautiful general figure. What do nice guys do? Well, they put others before themselves, they need a reason **NOT** to trust someone rather than a reason **TO** trust someone, they remember birthdays and buy gifts, they loan money and tell the person they are offering the money to that they don't need to pay back, they offer to tutor friends and strangers for free in a subject area of their expertise, they say uplifting things to people having a bad day, they let someone they don't even know borrow notes to copy for a test the next day, etc. I am one of those people. If you are also one of these people, I would bet on a few things:

* You have poor coping skills.
* You have been treated like absolute dog-shit in your life.
* You may be depressed.
* You may be/have been overweight.
* You have been in &lt;= 1 relationship that was very important.

So, this post is to you fellow nice-guys. [If you would like my resume, this post describes the shit I have had to deal with](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18gtig/selfpreservation_through_selfdestruction/). I would not recommend reading it unless you have a lot of time. A TL;DR would be that I have been treated poorly, led-on, taken advantage of, and suffered severe 'nice-guy-syndrome'.

What is nice-guy-syndrome? Being taken advantage of. I think this is most prevalent in M/F interactions. Friend-zoned, and other zones of the like. I would like to get to the body of this post sometime today, but I really want to define how important it is to know about these types of things which defines a nice-guy and his negative symptoms.

I think that the biggest problem for nice-guys, is that it is really difficult to just NGAF. That is of course stating no disrespect toward people that do very well for themselves and others that don't care, but nice-guys tend to live in their head a lot more than in the real world. Nice-guys are usually intelligent enough to deduce the best course of action for how to treat someone really well (don't get confused with the too-nice-guys), but don't have enough control over their mind to stop it from doing negative things like:

* Discounting positive attributes of themselves.
* Discountin the fact that they are a nice-guy.
* Taking into account other factors that may be causing problems. (Blaming themselves.)
* Internalizing emotion versus expressing it.

I think that nice-guys come to this subreddit because of the end of a relationship. That's what brought me here, I can't imagine I'm that different from others. What will be most important in this topic is not HTNGAF, rather, how to care about yourself and distract yourself from things that you need to realize that you care about too much. I think we can all agree that one cannot simply stop giving a fuck if it is in his/her DNA. This post is to keep nice-guys nice-guys, because this subreddit, however infinitely helpful, has probably turned nice-guys into not-so-nice-guys. I'll give you an example of my own problem:

I was in a relationship that I was desperate for, for a long time prior to achieving it. (If you read my post) I was truly in need of feeling that somebody cared about me. I got it, it ended, and I fell back into the same manic-depressive state that I was in before the relationship, except 10x worse. I'm in therapy for that and other things, mostly gaining coping skills, and I fell that I should pass on some of the knowledge that has kept me alive to others that may need it.

A few things you need to know:

* Realize and cherish that you are a nice-guy.
* Promise yourself that you will not stop being a nice-guy.
* Learn that you are not the cause of all your problems (however, blaming everyone else is nearly as bad).
* You are a wonderful person, and most of the world doesn't deserve you.

The relationship I went into was great, which was why it was so hard for me when it ended. However, you must continue to do your best to treat every girl the best you can in the future, just like you did in the first relationship, because it wouldn't be fair to another girl to be treated less than the cunt that tore your heart into its molecular state.

If you start thinking about something in detail that makes you sad, I recommend these steps:

* Repeat to yourself, out loud, ""Moment to moment."" As fast as you can until the words no longer mean anything to you.
* Tell yourself, out loud, ""I will tell you what my next thought will be.""
* Tell yourself that depression is a flaw in chemistry, not in character.
* Find something to busy yourself with.

You may modify any of the steps to fit you, and do them in any order, but the end result **MUST** be that you understand how valuable you are and how capable you are of getting over something. It will be weird at first, you will think you are lying to yourself, but you will come to understand that what you are saying **IS** true, and you no longer need anyone else to say it to you to believe it. The moment to moment thing is how you need to start living. I bet that you are living in the future or living in the past, either way, you are getting depressed about something (probably) that is much smaller than you let yourself realize. You are thinking for others and how they will interact with you before you meet them, or after you distort your view on them. Stop, silly.

If you start to get angry about something, I recommend these steps:

* Exercise.
* Exercise.
* Exercise.
* Exercise.

No modification to these steps are allowed, and they must be done in that order. Exercise will help you feel better about yourself, your self-image, and your overall self-esteem. You will get high after each session, and you will forget your problems and continue to be as productive as you know that you can be. You will crave that high, you will achieve that high, and you will get healthy in the process.

Lastly, you need to know that you are a fucking wonderful person and nobody deserves you unless proven otherwise. That last part is important. When you see a beautiful girl, that cunt doesn't deserve you. If you see a beautiful girl and she treats you with kindness, that cunt doesn't deserve you. If she treats you with kindness, respect, listens to your problems, helps you as much as you help her, tries to help others on a regular basis, and sees eye to eye with you on every make-or-break you have in a relationship, she *might* deserve you, and you should give her the chance to **PROVE** she deserves you. The same goes with anyone else. If you meet a guy, or anyone, and are about to get into some kind of relationship (friends, SO, etc.) they must prove themselves to you by being better than others around them, because others around them are the same people that were disrespectful and hurtful to you. Another important note is that you are not a doctor. You are not a therapist. You are not an all-powerful deity. You will get sad due to things outside of your control, and others will as well. You won't be able to fix anyone or anything, that is the biggest mistake I have made repeatedly. I recommend that you don't get into a relationship with someone who has dark things in his/her past that still affects him/her. Of course, it is always wonderful to meet people with flaws, but flaws that still bother them vs. flaws they have accepted and fixed and moved on from will be the demise to the both of you, and it will be excruciating. You cannot help someone move past his/her flaws, they need to do that on their own, just like you do. You can do it. I love you, I understand you, and I hope that you move on from whatever brought you here so you can help others like you have always helped them.

Now, the part about NGAF. Be a nice guy. Seriously, do it, you will feel better than if you treat someone like shit. *However*, do not expect anything from being a nice guy. Treat everyone exactly they way you want to be treated (save for romantically), but do not expect anything from it. Don't expect some kind of reward from that person. Do not expect a reward for being a nice guy. Do not expect to change anyone's life. You may save a life, you may piss someone off for being a nice-guy, you may help someone, you may not. Helping someone is really about getting him/her to help him/herself. Let them know that the world isn't completely full of douchebags that don't care about them at all, but make sure that you internalize that they can't affect you. You need to be a rock. A soft and gentle rock, but a hardcore motherfucker underneath that can fight off an army of mountain lions while feeding the birds and tending to the flowers. You are a wonderful person, and what brought you here was probably something out of your control. Get your life in control, and don't care about anything that you cannot directly influence. I.e, someone else's emotional state. I hope you feel better, I hope you learn that you are the only person worth GAF about for a while, and I hope you find someone that gives two fucks about you so you can do the same for them.

EDIT: To whoever gave me Gold, thank you! I will be posting more soon, I hope I continue to to submit helpful things to this wonderful community!

EDIT:  NEVER BOTTLE EMOTION.  Let it out.  Tell a friend, tell a therapist, tell a pet, take it out on something inanimate.  No matter how much of a rock you become on the outside, negative emotions that you harbour within become hydrofluoric acid to your mind.

EDIT: To those of you crying because I said ""cunt,"" I apologize. This post was mostly for myself and for me to attempt to help others through experiencing my struggle. I hold the upmost respect for both men and women, but I will assume every guy to be a prick and every woman to be a cunt. Why? It has been my experience that that is exactly how it is 9/10. It is a defense mechanism that has been keeping myself from becoming attached and heartbroken more than the 16 times I already have. Sixteen times, sixteen girls, sixteen cunts. I am sorry for overgeneralizing, but it is what **I** need to do to protect myself.

EDIT: Everyone, as promised, I made a [follow up](http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/19khyf/followup_to_my_niceguys_post_depression_and/), I hope that those of you who felt helped with this post feel helped by the next one.

",Zenoctilles,445,47,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/18vtfn/if_you_want_a_social_life_dont_give_a_fuck/,"A few days ago, I posted my story here about grabbing people's phone numbers off Facebook, in hopes of contacting them later for hanging out if need be. Quite a few people were very receptive to the idea, but there too were others who ignored my requests completely. *I was starting from ground zero with no real friends or phone numbers, so I had to be a little forward about it and* **not give a fuck**.

Yesterday, I didn't have anything to do after school. So I thought, why don't I invite some people to one of my favorite bars? I texted about 15 people, inviting them to this bar. About 8 people declined, saying that they had prior commitments/other bullshit, but I got about 7 positive responses. Within thirty minutes, the first of these guys start showing up, and I started greeting them. Within an hour, everyone who said that they were coming came. 

The group was an odd mixture of co-workers/acquaintances at my university/people from the local My Little Pony fanclub. But, everyone was pretty cordial and I introduced everyone to everyone. 

So, for the next two hours, we all drank cheap-ass beer and talked about lots and lots of random shit. Small talk sort of stuff, really. At the end of two hours, we were all kind of wasted and the meet was starting to wind down. I called for the bill, everyone contributed what they thought was fair, and I gave a $6 tip to one of the barmaids. 

Then, one of my co-workers (we'll call him Chris) said to one of my university buddies (who we'll call John), ""You are a funny motherfucker. I'm glad I met you tonight. What's your number? We should hang out more.""

With that, everyone started exchanging their phone numbers with one another. I was really happy to see that. 

We got up from our stools, and everyone present thanked me for putting this drinking meet together. **""We should do this more""** was the most common refrain I heard. From there, everyone started heading their separate ways (me and my university buddies stuck together because we were all taking the same train home). 

If I didn't text these guys, most of them would have been doing absolutely nothing at home or in their dorm rooms. *If you want to go from doing pointless Internet surfing every night and lamenting about not having a social life to a having an actual social life*, then you must learn the first rule: **Don't give a fuck and just call people**.

**Don’t give a shit.** Worrying about your appearances won’t change them, so don’t spend that energy on something shallow like your bone structure. Sounds easy, but it took me about twenty years before this really sunk in. Tomorrow, get rid of your negative thoughts. Go for at least 24 hours without thinking anything bad about yourself or anyone else. It makes a REMARKABLE difference on how happy you are.

**Know a little bit about everything.** If you don’t know something they’re talking about, ask them to teach you about it. People LOVE showing off what they know and always love an attentive audience. Plus, you get to learn something new. And knowledge is power.

**Don’t bring up people’s short-comings. Period.** This sounds like a “duh” thing, but a lot of insecure people want to bring other people down to their level. Don’t ever do this. This is the top social-slaughtering weapon you can bring to the table. Plus you’ll just be an all around cunt that no one wants to be around, attractive or not. In fact, do the opposite, compliment them. It’s fuckin’ weird, but when you make someone else feel good about themselves, you automatically feel really good about yourself.

**Be healthy!!** Even if you’re skinny, WORK OUT!! Go running at least once a week, do twenty push-ups before bed and in the morning. Your boobs will be perkier, your ass will be plumper, your skin is more clear. It’s awesome. Eating better also lifts up your mood. I eat a shit-ton of fruit and I feel immediately better and almost always have a good day without being tired or moody, plus no guilt that chocolates or gross snacks brings you. Plus you can feel superior to nasty slobs everywhere, and that in itself is a good feeling.

**(chick bonus) Make-up.** Some girls look great au-natural, but for the rest of us it is totally socially acceptable to slop skin-colored shit all over our faces. Do it. Lips too thin?? Lip liner. Eyes too small?? Eyeliner. Blush is a tiny factor that makes you look much better; use it. You can do all sorts of shit with this stuff; contour your nose, hollow out fat faces, make your eyes further or closer together. It’s like magic. Do NOT become dependent on make-up to feel good. This is a tool, not a necessity. You’re doing your make-up so you can look in the mirror and think “fuck yea!” not “now a guy will want to have sex with me!” *And frankly, no one else but you will give a shit whether you’re good looking or not.*

Seriously, keep that in mind. Let me put it in all caps: **NO ONE ELSE BUT YOU WILL GIVE A SHIT WHETHER YOU’RE GOOD LOOKING OR NOT.** No matter how many times you’ve been beaten with the ugly stick, some chump out there will think you’re just an amazingly, hot piece of ass. I’ve seen guys who are just plain unfortunate looking have ridiculous amounts of sex. The fucker didn’t even have good hygiene. It’s gonna happen no matter what.

Only stupid fucks won’t be your friend because of your appearance. If you really don’t have any friends, it’s because of your personality, not looks. I still have my big feet, wavy hair, and acne scars but I’ve got a ton of friends who have fun being with me, and that’s fucking awesome!",,False,,t5_2tna8,1344267623.0,,,True,t3_xroy7,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/xroy7/tldr_be_cool_as_fuck_and_take_care_of_yourself/,

Whenever I did something I thought would be fun, and someone commented on it, I'd quickly belt out ""I-do-what-I-want.""

Today, I actually thought about what I'd been saying. As I stood at the top of the latter at work, I realized how much power I had in that single line. ""*I* do what *I* want.""

Large shaking movements are not good for one's health when one finds oneself at the top of a rather heighty ladder.

I've always erred on the side of caution in my life so far. Didn't ask girls out, ""What if they say no?"" Wouldn't try my hardest, because ""What if I fail?"" Never pushed my limits, because ""What if it wasn't enough?""

so, i ventured to a club with my friend to grab a few drinks and shoot the shit. upon entering, we ordered our drinks, stood at a bar table and conversed about life, 0 fucks and engaged in hearty laughter. high fives were thrown, hugs were given. 

we noticed a handful of dudes going up to the ladies we shared the table with (we posted up without talking to them. we didn't even notice them since we were having such a good time) and tried to do the whole spiel. trying to grab their hands to dance, making douchy/overly cocky jokes, the like. we shrugged it off and continued to have a jolly good time! 

we had such an awesome time talking, we barely touched our drinks. barkeep yells out last call, we down our drinks and are ready to move on to the next bar/club. all the while, these guys are still going up trying to seal the deal, trying to get some sort of acknowledgement from the ladies and failing miserably. you can see how uncomfortable the ladies were. they would turn around, sip on their drinks, look at each other and roll their eyes at the guys, etc.

my friend and i are about to leave, and we decide to invite them to the next bar. ""hey, we're going across the street to a bar. would you ladies like to join us?"" ""let me ask my friend... sure!""

we get to the next bar, the girls buy US two drinks each. we talk about where they're from, what their hobbies are, and laugh at each other's jokes. barkeep tells us it's closing time so we finish our drinks and ask what the ladies are doing next. they say they're going home as we step out of the bar. taxi rolls up and the ladies get in. to our surprise, they invite us! wasn't even in our agenda. feels good, man. we get to their place, they forgot their keys inside so my friend jumps in the bathroom window and unlocks the front door. we go inside and have a good time talking about random stuff and BAM. my friend is in the bedroom with one girl and i'm on the couch with the other. feels great, man. we left their apt at 5am and went to dennys. he had country fried steak and i ordered a lumberjack slam. we didn't know what to think! flippin awesome night!

before we left, they gave us their numbers and asked to hang out again. also, we had asked about the dudes at the club and they both agreed the guys were buttholes. i asked why us? they said we looked cool having a good time together with all the high fives and hugs and figured we were good guys!

COOL BEANS.
 
**tl;dr** friend and i went to a club, giving 0 fucks and had a great time by ourselves. we asked two girls who were being hit on by broskis if they'd like to join us at the next bar. they said yes, bought us drinks and invited us back to their apt. sexy time ensued for both of us.

Achieving this satisfaction is not an easy road because you have to risk your self-esteem, but it comforts me in knowing that when I fail I have just eliminated one road block to a success.  

Failing more often has also led me to a better understanding that usually a situation that goes sour is not a result of my actions.

It's finally time to become the beast that had lingered in the egg for so long. Time to stop being overlooked as the plain, dull creature hidden behind the shell of ego that you abused for so long while you overdeveloped. It's time to break free and accept the judgement and criticism. It is time to suffer the potential bitter resentment in order to achieve success. It's time to identify yourself and accept who you are. It's time to respect yourself, to change what you don't like, and learn to deal with that which can't be changed. Stop being so needy. Stop worrying. Stop overthinking every tiny last useless detail and jumping to conclusions. You are stronger than all the hate in the universe. You do not need to accept the misery and shame that others give you as a fact. It's false unless you truly believe it to be right. No need to be shy at all. Express your feelings. You have worth and until you see it then noone else will. You have no obligation to anybody but yourself. YOU choose to care, you choose to let others affect you. You perceive their bullshit as whatever you want it to be. Seek out the good and hold on to it. Time to start winning. Loss is not an acceptable outcome. There is only one who matters, **you motherfucker**. You matter more than everybody else. Quit your pseudo kindness beta type personality. Nobody is more important than you (I repeat this for emphasis). You will never gain the respect of anyone if they take you for granted. You are someone who's respect must be earned by others. Everybody does not have to like you, and you do not have to like them. In fact, find out who you really don't like and move away from them. Quit seeking approval, be yourself and it will come to you. The pathway to your success shall only illuminate itself in your own mind. Follow the steps you know already exist and allow them to guide you to happiness. And maybe happiness was always there, just waiting to be created, wanting to break free from the barriers of excuses you surround it with. Maybe outside interactions are just an excuse to feel what you want. Do not let the world get you down; get up above the world.

*I'd like to give a nod to all you guys individually but again, that would take a long while and I didn't know this many people would respond. You guys rock, carry on being badasses.*

I see a lot of people with problems, who then go on to ask for advice in not giving a fuck about said problems. Well, I'd like to respond to them since maybe there's a chance that the right advice could help them out. Responding to all of them in turn would take too damn long however, So ill just do this instead. Now, I am not going to follow suit, give an inspiring rant with copious use of the word fuck, and try to rally the masses as others have successfully done. I don't think I really need to because for some people, this shit just works.

**A quick backstory, and a long story short.**

Back in high school I was more or less a social retard. I had a veritable silo of fucks devoted to the fact that I couldn't level with the people I wanted to know, hated the people not in the first group, and didn't know where that really put me. My friends, knowing that I would rather not feel like shit about something so stupid, gave me a friendly shove in the right direction by signing my scrawny ass up for football, and then totally ignoring my protests (well, this among other things). Yes, parts of it sucked, no, I would not change it. It threw me out of my element and forced me to adapt, and in doing so I learned how to stop caring what the jackasses thought, and I learned that improving myself was more important than all that high school bullshit. I found myself some ways to give no fucks.

**No fucks he says?!**

Why yes, no fucks. All it took was a heap of conscious effort, and, Ill be honest here, something that sounds vaguely akin to a mild self induced psychosis. More on that later.

You know that feeling you get when you are about to give a fuck? that feeling in your chest and gut region? or that sort of anxious squirm? Maybe you need to poop. I don't know. Its usually something unavoidable that you have to go through. Like that awkward 20 second period where you and another person on the sidewalk are walking directly at each other, and there's nowhere to look. Or some twat that you have to put up with. Or when you wind up having to talk to that one chick/guy who makes logical thoughts really goddamn difficult and who you are certain barely registers your existence? Or on a more serious note, the moment you realize that the shit hasn't just hit the fan, its been sucked into the intake of a jet turbine who's exhaust is pointed at your face.

**This is the part where I may say fuck a lot.**

As soon as you notice that familiar feeling, do like I did. Fucking FORCE yourself into that thing that is making you uncomfortable. Own it. Fake it. Babble to yourself in your head to blanket out any negative thoughts. Lose your fucking mind for a brief moment. Do whatever it takes but fucking force it like you have absolutely no other choice, and while forcing it, work on making yourself believe that you are fucking awesome at this. Try to let go of a bit of your useless feelings of limitation and doubt and just think ""I got this. Because I rock this shit""

Walking down the road and have that awkward moment? NOPE. Fucking make eye contact, and smile like you are the patron saint of charismatic badasses, then keep on strollin.

Gotta do something public that you are thinking about ditching? NO YOU FUCK, you have no other choice but to do that thing, and you will be uncomfortable as hell the entire time but you are going to do it anyways and be awesome as shit for the entire awful duration. Tell yourself that, scream it in your head if you need to drown out the thoughts of ""I wonder what that person is going to think abou--"" who fuckin cares dude, you had no other options and therefore that persons opinion is irrelevant.

Asshole at work? He probably has to break others down just to build himself up, the sad fuck. He is beneath you, despite the fact that you want to choke him.

Ex making your life hard? Feeling down about that break up? Well fuck, look at all the negative feelings that woman spawned. Your better off without that shit, and maybe you cant fully feel it, but fuckin keep telling yourself that. After all, your now on your journey to being a honey badger. You know what women who aren't your batshit insane ex are in to? fuckin honey badgers. Go get em'.

An awkward moment with the girl who has jedi like powers over your dangly parts? Well guess what motherfucker, FOCUS, and force yourself to act without caring about every nuance. Be fucking INTENSE about the opportunities presented. Have you ever met someone that lived life like they were so goddamn in tune with what they were doing that an atom bomb could go off in the back ground and it would not phase them? Blank out your other thoughts and be that guy for a brief moment.

**...Da fuq?**

Yes. In your mind, you know that its a facade you are throwing up. You are faking that confidence and ease, and maybe someone who is perceptive can tell, but the point isnt to be totally convincing, its to form a habit by conscious thought and repetition. The more you do it, the easier it is, and after a while, you don't have to try any more. When you are at the point where you can cast off the fucks you give when you need to, guess what? you no longer have any actual fucks, aside from the ones you allow to exist. When you find yourself able to have that conversation without consciously having to try and be at ease, then you actually are just at ease with yourself. Habit by repetition, and confidence by building it yourself. By ingraining in your own mind that you know what the fuck you are about, and that there genuinely is no reason to get worked up over this nonsensical shit in your life.

**TL:DR**

Edit. There was TL:DR here until I realized that it defeats the purpose of the stupid amount of writing I just did. If you dont have a few minutes to read this, then you aren't the target audience and don't actually need to read it anyways. You have your shit down to such a tight margin that those few minutes are too important to waste, which means you are doing good. Good job you fuckin' go getter.

When the class began, he wordlessly picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was.

The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles roll
ed into the open areas between the golf balls. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.

The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He asked once more if the jar was full.. The students responded with a unanimous ‘yes.’

The professor then produced two Beers from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar effectively filling the empty space between the sand.The students laughed..

‘Now,’ said the professor as the laughter subsided, ‘I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The golf balls are the important things—-your family, your children, your health, your friends and your favorite passions—-and if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house and your car.. The sand is everything else—-the small stuff.

‘If you put the sand into the jar first,’ he continued, ‘there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls. The same goes for life.

If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you.

Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.

Spend time with your children. Spend time with your parents. Visit with grandparents. Take your spouse out to dinner. Play another 18. There will always be time to clean the house and mow the lawn.

Take care of the golf balls first—-the things that really matter. Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.

One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the Beer represented. The professor smiled and said, ‘I’m glad you asked.’ The Beer just shows you that no matter how full your life may seem, there’s always room for a couple of Beers with a friend.

If this was the real purpose of this subreddit no one would subscribe to it; because we don't give a fuck. 

But there are nearly 50,000 ""honey badgers"" who all come on here asking how to not give a fuck about something, or telling how they taught someone how to not give a fuck. Either way, you are all giving fucks. Which seems completely counter intuitive to me. 

The whole truth is: we are all looking for something to give a fuck about. I know your are thinking ""OMG WTF I DUNT GIVVVEEE FFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUs about ne thing"" sure, at the very least you care about not giving fucks. But if you want to truly not give a fuck, that's where everything gets EXTREMELY counter intuitive: find the ONE THING you actually give a fuck about and go for it while not caring about anything that would get in your way.

Maybe you already understand this and I am typing the obvious and will be downvoted to oblivion, but to truly not give a fuck you have to stand for something. 

My case, I had been dragging my feet through school with the IDGAF attitude for 2 1/2 years for an accounting degree. Several drinking problems and complete emotional lack of connecting to people later I realized that I had literally not given a fuck at all for the last 3 years and had gotten no where. I was in a major that I hated, surrounded by people I didn't like (minus my roomates, love those muther fuckers) doing things I didn't even enjoy doing but had become dependent on doing them.

I dropped out. I took a semester off to find time to find out what I loved to do again and redefine me. In the end as cliche as it sounds I found that above all things I wanted to create a piece of technology that will change the world. With my history, people will always think that goal is unattainable. But I DON'T GIVE A FUCK what they say. I am back in school with an electronic computer engineering major busting my ass 80 hours a week. When I am done I will do what I want to do because the rules that everyone else has imposed on themselves do not apply to me(see reality distortion field). 

So if you want to be a true honey badger, find something worth giving a fuck about. Be it you, her, him, them, a goal, anything tangible or intangible devote yourself to something.

She was very slow in her response, so it was agonizing for me. That is, until I stumbled upon this subreddit. It made me realize a few things before she even rejected me.

1. She's a cool enough chick that even if we were ""just friends"" I'd be more than happy with that.

2. Emotional pain comes from loss. 
3. Loss comes from attachment. 
4. Attachment comes from a sense of ownership. I realized that I didn't own her, so I shouldn't feel loss if/when she turned me down.

Why did I feel so fulfilled? Was it because I worked hard at work and at the gym? Or because I had a great weekend partying with new and old friends? When I was reflecting on what made me happy, it wasn't any experiences when I was redditing or doing things by myself; it was experiences when I was interacting with other people.

There is no golden thought or secret to learn in order to be happy. There's opportunities to experience happiness all around you. All moments of the day.

Flashing back now to me hanging out with my buddies watching Megalodon (which Discovery channel totally dropped the ball on this one. Complete shit. Anyway...) and with this mindset I had of 'everything's fine as it's supposed to be' I noticed how evil commercials are. I can't describe to you now what they were saying specifically, but I fully recognized the tricks they try to play on your mind.

The end goal of  these advertisements and commercials is to make you feel inadequate. If you're just on auto-pilot you won't notice their veiled message, but it's there. They want to make you feel like you're missing something to be whole but that's so far from the the truth. They're trying to sell you a reality that doesn't exist.

You, me, everyone here only needs a few things to survive. Food, water, shelter and human contact. When human civilization became more complex and modernized, we wrote some unwritten social rules that you need more than just that. But that's all they are, just rules. Is there a social court featuring Judge Judy herself if you break these rules? No. Will anyone care that you are different? Maybe, but let them waste their time guessing how you tick.

On that note, recognize when you feel yourself lusting after something you don't have. You've already been given this life, what else could you possibly need after what you have now? It's an incredible gift this crazy idea called consciousness. Are you going to let someone else control yours?

She told me she was afraid that this was gonna be the last conversation we would have, ever. In that moment I realize she hasn't changed much and I repeated that I appreciated the apology and wished her the best (Implying that that conversation WAS our last ever). 

I guess the lesson out of all that is ""never let people play with you or your feelings"". Sorry for the rant-y post, I needed to say something :)

I want to clear up a little confusion that a lot of people seem to have. Not giving a fuck is NOT about APATHY. It's about ACCEPTANCE. There is a huge difference between the two. 

Apathy is simply the refusal to care. If we are apathetic about everything, we dismiss it as meaningless and not worth caring about. This is a terrible habit. It encourages us to disconnect with the world and be an isolated person. That's not what ""not giving a fuck"" is really about. 

Acceptance is the refusal of the urge to change something. Instead of saying ""I'm late for work. Whatever, I don't give a fuck"" we should say ""I'm late for work. I can't change that, and won't worry about it."" These two may seem the same to an aspiring honeybadger, but I can assure you, there is a difference. When you accept things as they are, a few things happen: 

* you stop trying to change the world. Not in the ""feed the homeless"" sense, but rather in the sense that you do not waste your time fighting that which you cannot control, things like weather, traffic, and gravity. 
* when you stop trying to change things, you see them as they really are, and appreciate them. If you stop complaining about the traffic and just enjoy the drive, the music on the radio, and accept that you will be moving slowly, you appreciate the moment more, and stress less 
* when you see things as they are, you grow to love them. Instead of wondering why that girl next to you won't shut up, maybe you will stop complaining and listen to what she has to say. Maybe she has something amazing to share with you. When you see a flower, you appreciate that it is a flower. It is hard to put into words, but acceptance of things leads to appreciation of them. 

And all of this ties into compassion. We exist as the universe, not in it. You are a part of the world. If you learn to love the world, you learn to love yourself. If you stop trying to change people, and let them be who they are, they are kinder to you, and you start to see beauty in everyone. Accept people, things, and the world for what it is, without trying to change it, and you will find it to be much more fulfilling. Because if you think of life as ""Me versus The World"", it is inevitable that the world is going to win, in the end. But if you work in sync with the world, everybody wins. 

What this all boils down to is this: stop trying to change the world, it can change itself. Instead, just enjoy the world for what it is. This attitude will cultivate a sense of well-being, a sense of connectedness with everything, a sense of compassion, and a larger appreciation for the life you have been given. 

Just some thoughts for you all.",,False,,t5_2tna8,False,,,True,t3_y8ypm,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/y8ypm/not_giving_a_fuck_and_compassion/,

You can be pointed in the right direction, but you must walk the path on your own to feel how it feels. There are three types of voices, two of which are worthwhile. The voice inside your head, and the voice coming out of someone else's mouth are the worthwhiles. The useless voice is the one you imagine others are thinking, the thought bubbles that appear over the heads of people around you. Spending undue effort on imagining what others might be thinking is what we're going to weed out this month. We're going to do this by listening to our own inner voice. 

For a few minutes a day, especially in a spot where you feel overwhelmed by the thought bubbles of others, recede into your head just a bit and listen to yourself. Listen to your lungs, to your heartbeat, focus on whatever facial expression you're holding. Ask yourself, ""Am I doing this for them, or for me?"" If the answer is them, question whether you truly want to be doing it. You and only you can inform yourself of what's important. Know why you choose to act the way you do. Is it because you think your friends expect it? Fuck them, do it because you want to or go do something else. Better yet, let the group know. Others may feel the same way. Is your boss motivating you to do something you could give a shit less about? Fuck caring about it. Do it for the money to clothe, feed, house and entertain yourself. Better yet, express your feelings on the topic. Your boss will respect you for it. If not, you're doing yourself a favor by exposing the fact that you have a shitty boss and should be doing something else. Be strong on the boundaries of all of your relationships this month 

Will you piss some people off? I certainly hope so. Will you cave due to the emotions of others? Will you listen to someone else's voice over your own solely to appease their emotional need? Feel good about what you're getting into. Have the confidence to back away from any situation and express yourself. Listen to yourself, this month, every single day.

I found out that she was moving out when I rolled in from work and found a rental application on the table with her name on it, and another guy's. I found out later that she was pregnant with his child. We were together for 7 years and married for 5. We have a 3 year-old son together.

I cried, wondered why, and quickly realized that being the best dad that I possibly can to my little guy would be extremely difficult if I was all down in the dumps and feeling sorry for myself. So I chose not to give a fuck. Now she's this other guy's problem, and I'm relieved as fuck that this next kid isn't mine. I didn't really want to be with her anyways. Someone who doesn't have the balls and the honesty to tell me that she's leaving to my face isn't the kind of person I want to hang out with.

I still worry a bit about the example that she's setting for my child, but in spite of the shitty things that she's done, I've never said a word against her, because she's my boy's mother, and she'll always be part of my life to some extent, and the worst thing you can do for a child is to involve them in your bullshit grown-up problems.

Being the oldest of 3 sisters and having a mother equally as young as he, you can imagine the confusion, stress, pain, hopelessness, and fear. I couldn't see my future, I forsaw the end of everything I'd known as my immediate family, all of us had grown up together...how would we possibly function? Not to mention my mother was a jaded, stern, seemingly emotionless figure before.. contrasting my fathers eccentric, passionate, joking nature. Now what? Am I supposed to try to replace his support both emotionally and financially in this family now? Well I could make this story much longer by going into all these unnecessary (but at the time involuntary) thoughts I'd had. But i'll tie it around to why it's relevant to HNTGAF. After dropping my lease and life to move back into my hometown, I found myself on my parents front porch with my dads guitar trying to resurrect the passion of what got me into music in the first place (primarily play drums now) and I realize that he didn't see me coming back here. Starting over and dropping all projects. This is why I could play his guitar instead of just look at it hanging on the wall forever now. Its progression in creativity. Doing what makes you happy. Moving forward. And if I let all these fucks I'm giving about something none of us can possibly do anything about now...then I'm treading water. It's not ""not giving a fuck"" about his death, it's about not letting the end of some ones life be the end of yours. Especially someone who loves you. So in short, I hung up the guitar and started on my path. I picked up an internship without any college experience, dropped my physically abusive boyfriend of three years, signed a lease with my sister next to an old and beloved family friend in a city I love, and am closer now to my mother than I would have ever cared to imagine we would be. Now here i sit in my giant beautiful living room playing his guitar again and I'm so happy, happier than I've ever been! And it's weird to say it out loud because just a few mouths ago I was at my lowest I'd ever experienced. But I don't give a fuck, I'm so fucking happy, and yes I miss him so much every God damn moment, but without him I wouldn't have realized all of this. What he taught me was not only reflected in his death but in his entire life. And that's parenting done right. So...

Tl;dr: fuck everything and go headfirst into the ""impossible"". The beginning of everything new and unknown is scary (I mean shit, being born is a bitch) but don't let that discourage you. You set your own limitations. So quit whining and fucking do what you've been saying you're going to do. You'll see the results faster than you may be able to perceive. Cause if you're not living you're dead. He lived, I can live too.

Love you, Daddy.

I was nervous though, it was my first time going to a restaurant all alone. It was also quite crowded where the waiter seated me, so I knew I had to keep it together.

Monday is a 2-for-1 special there, so ordering a burger and chips would give you another plate of the same. I reckon'd I wouldn't ask for it 'cos there's no way I could stomach another. Anyway, he brought my meal...as well as the one that comes free and he put it across the table from me for the empty seat. I felt a brief moment of embarrassment, as if he were serving an imaginary friend of mine. Having a table of girls right by me didn't help much either. One of them looked my way though, but I took that as a sign she liked what she saw *no doubt* (ha.)

I snapped out of it quickly though and asked him to put it in a bag for me instead 'cos I wouldn't be able to eat it then and there. The rest of the time I just chilled and ate my meal slowly over the next 15-20 minutes or so while browsing reddit on my phone. I'm glad to say that I gave maybe exactly zero fucks from then on and I took my time with everything. 

In the end I paid my bill, walked out and went home. It wasn't exactly an experience that changed my life though. I think that just assures me of how many fucks I actually don't have to give nowadays compared to before I found this subreddit. Anyway, just wanted to share my small victory. It'll definitely come in handy if I ever feel like eating alone again.

Last week, I met quite a few strangers online, with who I talk constantly. Today, I was walking down the road, and another dude next to me accidently slipped on ice. I chuckled and just instinctively said ""haha, be careful man, you can't see the ice under the snow"". I didn't even think about ""should I say it or not? what if he gets mad at me? It's pretty obvious that ice is harder to see, why should I say it and look like an idiot? Do I even have the right to say such a thing?"", but I did it. I just said it. And I wasn't beaten up or called offensive names. He snickered and commented along the lines of ""Yeah haha, this is one of the things I dislike about winter!"". I then thought for a second, but without fear just asked ""Eh? What are the other things you dislike?"". We had nice small talk about winter and how we wish for summer to come quicker, and parted ways. It was an amazing experience for me. Even if it's a small feat, I'm just so happy to keep walking forward, beating my anxiety step by step. 

Now that I reflect on it, one of the reasons I was anxious perpetually was making goals too high for myself. Making a goal to talk to everybody I see at the mall did not work out for me as well as I thought, I haven't even went to the mall to begin with. Starting from having small talk here and there was more realistic and I actually succeeded. Also, I realised how similar people are. You think you are the only one over-analyzing what you want to say in a dialogue? That person is doing the same, no doubt, just that it may be not as heavy as your analyzing. At least when he's not around a lot of familiar friends, that's what I noticed. People just want to talk, they don't really care what about (may not apply to introverts).

This movie is about a guy who cares too much about material possesions and somehow he joins this fight club that helps him to feel free and to not give a fuck about the meaningless things in life. Fighting helped him express energy and feel more powerful and strong enough to handle life.

Matrix:

I'm sure everyone has seen it but the not giving a fuck in this movie comes from Neo, the main character, realizing his true potential and realizing that life is not really real and that its not what it seems. After learning the truth he begins to master the system(life) and he tries to help free other people from the illusionary world.

American Beauty:

I just saw this movie for the first time today and I can honestly say it is one of my favorite movies by far. Its about a man that finally decides to change his ordinary life pattern and do things that make him happy instead of living life by rules set up by society. The things he does makes him seem different but he enjoys himself and he learns that is the best way to live. by not giving a fuck. 

Yes Man:

This is another one of my favorites its a movie where the main character Jim Carrey gets advice from a friend to stop saying no to all the oppurtunities in his life and just go after what he wants. Saying yes to new things helped him to realize the importance of not giving a fuck about taking chances in life because of the benefits you will recieve.

Office Space:

This movie is about a man stuck in an everyday job that finally decides to change his life and do what he wants. He says what he wants, does what he wants because he finally decides to stop giving a fuck about what the consequences are and just chooses to live a free life.

Please check them out. The essential message I got from all of these movies was basically to stop living a routine life. Stop going through life caring about whats going to happen next because whatever is going to happen in life IS GOING TO HAPPEN WHETHER YOU WANT IT TO OR NOT. Stop giving a fuck and just live life. I know its hard because I still struggle but just keep moving forward.

No, it's not like that. We aren't angry, we're just disappointed.

Let's take a gander at this subreddit real quick. Check out that sidebar. Mmm. Look at that fucking header. Classy. You see that title? ""how to not give a fuck"". Poetry. 

Notice how it doesn't say ""fix my life for me"" or ""make me feel better"" or ""solve my problems because I don't know how""? There's a reason for that.

This isn't /r/relationship_advice or /r/mmfb . The point of this subreddit isn't to make you cheer up. 

Let's take a tangent here. It's important; I promise. 

It isn't our job to fix your life. ""But bikewithoutafish, this is /r/howtonotgiveafuck! You're supposed to teach us!"" Well, dearest child, yes and no. See, the thing is, this is your life. Yours. You, my sweet little angel, have been given a wonderful gift of being able to be alive, to feel, to love, to hate, and to understand (to some degree) the world around us and inside us. This life is your life, light of my soul.

If you aren't mature enough to make an effort to control your life, and instead turn to some strangers online to fix all of your problems instantly and painlessly by posting here you have bigger issues than learning to not give a fuck. You need to grow up. 

Now, shit gets meta here. This is an issue of both content and character. No one wants to wade through hundreds of posts about how she broke your heart or how you will never get with him or whatever. That's boring and sophomoric. That makes this subreddit a worse place for everyone. 

BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, if your response to these relationship issues, and others, is to post about it online to get our sagely wisdom, there is an underlying issue with you. You're not giving right fucks.

See, to me, giving fucks is a virtue. It's like the Eightfold path in Buddhism. Let's use an example to illustrate this. One of the parts of the Eightfold path is ""Right Speech"", namely ""Right speech, explained in negative terms, means avoiding four types of harmful speech: lies (words spoken with the intent of misrepresenting the truth); divisive speech (spoken with the intent of creating rifts between people); harsh speech (spoken with the intent of hurting another person's feelings); and idle chatter (spoken with no purposeful intent at all)."" (http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/speech.html)

Notice this doesn't say ""Don't ever talk, because language is inadequate and harmful"", or some shit, it basically boils down to ""Don't be an asshole. Say what you mean, mean what you say. Use common sense. Don't lie"".

Giving fucks is like the ninth part of the path. Give right fucks. That's what we mean when we say to not give a fuck. If you gave literally no fucks you would be a heroin junkie or a protozoan ooze that never leaves your couch. That's not a good life.

But on the other hand, we aren't your babysitters. It takes two people to learn: one to teach, and the other to listen.

YOU have to make an effort to better yourself. 
YOU are responsible for your own life. 
YOU have to be prepared to learn, and come here with something to bring to the table, instead of a post that just pleads for our advice about your shitty ex-girlfriend.

And, as a community

WE have to be prepared to help those who will help themselves;  
WE have to be able to give advice on matters, regardless of how banal or dumb they are IF they are offered earnestly and with the intention of self-betterment;  
WE have to be dedicated to creating a community in which discussion and wisdom can flourish, together.

So, I'll quit rambling now.

Henceforth, all posts posts asking for relationship advice that do not show any initiative on the OP's behalf will be deleted and OP will be directed to /r/relationship_advice or a similar subreddit. If you are not prepared to make an effort BEFORE POSTING to make yourself better, we should not be expected to make an effort either.

Similar posts, ones that bring nothing to the table, will also be deleted, as per moderator discretion. 

This is a wonderful place, and there can be a lot of learning here, guys. Just have some fucking common sense. 

Hugs and kisses,
/u/bikewithoutafish and the mods.

P.S. Any questions or discussions about this change can be brought up on this post.

Then it hit me...this is my best friend from high school, and an ex who is still a really good friend, both of whom I talk to on a regular basis even though we're all at different universities. My jealousy and emotions in these stupid hypothetical anxiety-ridden situations is ruining both my relationships with these two great people. Plus, if a relationship is going to be valued by how many ""likes"" it gets on Facebook rather than on the merit of the two people within it then fuck that, that's a narcissistic superficial outlook based on external validation.

I'm going to give them both a call the next time it feels appropriate. I'm done giving a fuck about useless emotional shit that just hinders my relationships behind the scenes. 

I'm still in a bit of a rut right now, but I'm working so hard to get out of it.

My goals:

* Get into that study abroad program. Mother. Fucking. Europe. 
* Become that confident, witty guy that I used to be and want to be again
* Put on some muscle, /r/gainit style
* Read everything
* Get into medical school
* Actually learn the guitar, no more fucking around
* Fuck Netflix, fuck Reddit, fuck Facebook, and fuck YouTube. There's a whole world out there and while the instant gratification that the internet offers is great in the short term, it isn't conducive to long-lasting happiness. 
* Fuck the past. I am who I want to be and I'm not letting little stuff define my personality
* A bed is for sleeping after a hard day's work, not for lying about during the day worrying about shit that's out of my control.

I'd say I've developed some form of social anxiety, and will find any excuse to get out of seeing people. It's at the point where I barely get invited to anything anymore because I just don't turn up. I was invited to only one NYE party in my city, by a girl I literally hadn't seen in two years. Scrolling through the attendees list, I knew not a single person, I laughed at the idea of going - everyone seemed super young-professional / intimidating. To my shock I saw that one of my all time favourite designers was on the list (it was a small list, which made it more intimidating). This dude is the person I want to be. He and his partner won several international awards this year and are really well known to people in my country. I knew I would never live with myself if I missed the opportunity to meet him.

I spent the day moping / anxious I guess because I couldn't think of an excuse to get out of having to go. I knew I had to. For an hour I was just psyching myself up, reading through some posts on here. I still let it get to 11pm before I could bring myself to go, and when I got to the house, I waited 10minutes outside playing on my phone before I went in. It was as bad as I thought it would be. I felt like every single person was looking at me, wondering what I was doing there. When I finally found the girl I knew she barely said hi, she was completely wasted and sitting on her boyfriend's lap. I asked for directions to the bathroom, which I planned to use and then leave. That's when I had my big moment, I decided I wasn't going to start 2013 by being a little bitch. I decided to see not knowing anyone as a good thing. I poured myself a drink and walked over to a group of people and introduced myself ( this probably doesn't seem like a big deal to someone without social anxiety) I honestly was past giving a fuck about what anyone thought of me. I must have met 10 people before I saw my target, the designer. I walked straight up to him and shook his hand - said ""Dude, you're ******"" or something equally as accosting. We ended up speaking for 30mins, about design, life, philosophy, everything. His partner came over and joined too. As they left they took my number, gave me a business card and told me I should visit their studio this week and that we should all go for a drink after.

Mid-way through last year my first and then only girlfriend of 2.5 years (I was 19) broke up with me and told me she'd cheated on me. I went from happy as Larry to depressed and sapped of confidence. Life continued on this way until November when I met a girl who was, aside from the insanity that eventually reared it's unstable head, pretty fucking cool. We got along great, but I started to become dependant on her and so when after about 6 weeks she decided she'd had enough of leading me on, lying to me and treating me like a sub-human and got back with her knobpolisher ex, I got really bad. Like suicidal bad. Everything started to collapse around me and I lost all will to go on.

Then one day I started browsing this sub - reading stories and motivational quotes, etc. - and a light flicked on. The honey badger inside of me was born, and like the true fuck-less God-tier being it is, is shredded my insecurities, lack of confidence and dependance on others to shreds.

I decided then and there to stop. Giving. Fucks.

Sometimes, it goes well, other times not-so-much, but hey, who the fuck cares? Anyway, the number one subject on this sub seems to be relationship issues; for example, every day there's at least one post up asking, ""How do I talk to a girl?"" There are others, but I'll deal with those at a later time.

So, how to talk to girls? The answer, I'm afraid, is shockingly, painfully simple: just like you'd talk to anyone else. Seriously. I'm not joking. Here's why: ""Women are people, too."" I've said that so many times in this sub, I've contemplated getting it tattooed on my ass or something; it's basically my catchphrase here. But it's true, and many people miss that. Women are not a target, below us men, that we pursue like hunters chasing a deer, only to gloat about how many we conquered; but neither are they goddesses, an unachievable goal that we're supposed to cower in awe of. They're right in the middle; they're people worthy of respect, but they neither need nor want our ""worship."" Like I said, ""Women are people, too."" The second part of that phrase is ""Treat them as such."" Should be simple to remember.

But then, every now and then, someone will say, ""Yeah, but she's not your everyday girl; she's [insert exaggerated character traits here]."" Sorry, pal, but you're wrong. She *is*, in fact, your everyday girl, whether she's that girl you've been neighbors with since you were six or Kate Upton. The only thing really special about her is your perception of her. Take away the divinity, and what is a goddess but an ordinary woman? Something to chew on.

Now, I'll be honest with you: I used to have huge problems talking with girls... well, with anyone, really; I had social anxiety out the ass. But then, I came to the slow realization that, regardless of our differences, we're all still people, and still deserve to be treated on an even playing field. Even today, I'm still single, and outside of a tumultuous two-month ""relationship,"" I have been all my life. Now, though, rather than the cause of my singlehood being a crippling feeling of inadequacy, I'm at the point where I won't be satisfied with just anybody, and am more or less waiting for a girl more up my alley to go after.

I'm a pretty mediocre DJ. My entire life I've been worried about being mediocre at something. At not impressing people the first, second, or whatever record time it's been tried. This attitude held me back, especially consider that any activity get harder and more complicated the more you get involved into it. Shortly said, I bounced around from thing to thing expecting me to be amazing at all of them, and was incredibly embarrassed when I wouldn't be and would give up. 

Tonight, the bar I was DJing in was mostly empty, and I didn't know the staff too well. I started playing some more off-the-path stuff ([Forrest Gump- Frank Ocean](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iyFdCYEz7s).), and at one point got pretty into a couple of the songs I was playing. I started headbanging a little behind the booth, and one of the waitstaff walked by. He saw me, smiled, and started headbanging as well while he walked back to the bar. 

And I didn't think anything of it. 

I think that's one of the first times in my life that I didn't over analyze someone's reaction to a performance of mine. I didn't realize it until just now, but it's such an amazing feeling of understanding.

I shouldn't not give a fuck about the things I do, I should not give a fuck about the way I CHOOSE the things I do. All my life I've been picking up activities because I think they'll impress other people. I excel in everything very quickly, and then hit a plateau because my heart's not truly behind it. Once I stop impressing people, the act becomes shameful to me and I can't practice or perform in front of people. Tonight, I made some mistakes, played some strange music, and killed whatever dancefloor there was once or twice. 

And I had fun.

Today I went for a walk in the forest, there's a trail that used to be railroad tracks that's been filled in with gravel, pretty close to where I live. As a result there are trees leaning inward over the whole trail, except when traversing the bridge over the creek, floating in midair over glitter trickles. I sat down on a bench for a smoke. After a few minutes, an old man comes around the bend. All you can hear is the weak drawl of midday insects and the sound of him crunching closer. 

""Mind if I share that bench with you?"" He says. ""No problem,"" I said. Moving the backpack to the ground and scooching over. Now my social anxiety kicks in. I'm a young guy, I'm not gonna be able to say anything to this old man. He's gotten really far in life and he didn't have to meet me to do it. He's old, maybe 70s, but he's classy, wearing slacks and a hat. Just to go for a walk in the forest, lol. And he asks me a couple questions, and we can both just tell that I or both of us don't want to talk any more. He sighs. I smoke. Seconds pass. He keeps sighing, but it doesn't make me anxious because they don't sound like angry sighs. They seemed to be completely unrelated to emotions of any sort. He keeps doing his sighs every 20 seconds or so. Then he starts to look at me after he does it. I think to myself. I stop tensing up that there is a human next to me. I start to take deep breaths. Everything sped back up. I hadn't even realized that I was breathing so shallow, even holding my breath at times. Just to listen. Because having low self esteem and mentally treating his presence as a stress caused me to put up a wall. It was underlying fear. It's how I've interacted with all people except friends my whole life. Sometimes I even *do* it around my family and friends. But this old man, after noticing me breathing. Got up, and said thank you and I smiled, and thanked him back. 

I sat there a little longer, breathing, and listening to the noises in the background get louder. As he drew further away, his footsteps got louder. As I breathed I noticed things moving, like leaves blowing or insects flitting past. The wind became a luscious symphony. My awareness became 100% active. I need to meditate on this. It's like the guy could tell that a teenager sitting in the forest not wanting to talk and not wanting to breathe, needed help. And he understood that he didn't have to talk to do it.

I practiced breathing as I swam in the creek, and on the walk back home. Things seemed clearer. I thought about how much I seemed to give a fuck about my appearance to others: when around people I deem worse/stupider than me, I am judgemental, and unhappy; when around people I deem better/wiser than me I am reclusive, and unhappy, and how this led me to have a dismal outlook on life.

It was then that I realized. You don't do everything that you feel. You feel everything that you do. That is completely separate from how often you give fucks. If you fully engage in everything you do, even when looking at a rock or writing your name or riding a rollercoaster or fucking or yelling at an asshole in traffic or eating..... Fully engage. Breathe. Thoughts will effortlessly spring forth from the experience, because you made it an experience. You will have emotions about the experience. But whether or not you give fucks about the experience determines whether or not to seek that experience again, and what experiences can next build on this one. If you try to think about what is best, you will stress yourself out. You have to use the world, it's your perceptional filter. When you lose touch with that filter, you are only filtered by the self. And that is a fucking scary, unhealthy filter to use.

Breathe. Relax. Let thoughts emerge, don't purge for them. If you don't like your surroundings and current sequence of events, well, they'll end, and you'll survive through it. And if you do, then you get to give some fucks about it, and that feels kind of good.

As the title may suggest, there was a cute girl there that I wanted to ask to dance but due to social shortfalls, a surplus of fucks (and a rather large intake of wine), kept putting off to the next song... and then to the next song, and the next, so forth... About an hour before the music was supposed to finish, I released my fucks into the wild (allowing them to be adopted to less fortunate citizens) and balls'ed up.

She agreed almost straight away and we danced every song that was played until the end of the night.  Afterwards, while everyone else was packing up, we just kept talking, asking plenty of questions about each other, telling jokes, the lot, to realise that we do have quite a bit in common.

Eventually I (kind of*) asked her out and (given the 'kind of') she said yes :)

It's all promises and wishes from now on, but take this as a notice: if she had said no, I could have just left and gone home knowing that I did the right thing for myself, and while it wouldn't have been a great result, it would have been a result nonetheless.  The situation is different with her saying (kind of*) yes, so I'll be sleeping well tonight :)

Whether this is the right thing to post here or not, I don't give a fuck.  I'm a happy man tonight, and I hope everyone takes a page from this post that any event you go to, most of the people there you'll never see again, so asking them to dance, and possibly asking out later on, is not a big deal; just balls up and do it.

So I'm sitting there, stuffing my face with delicious, yet tasteless donuts and doritos and I ask myself: Why am I eating this when I can't taste it?

Fact is: it was just a bunch of shitty food that I couldn't taste due to my nose, yet I could definitely have seen myself eating it all up. I ate a little bit more, then thought to myself, ""stop"". I stopped and took a step back and got deep as fuck. Why eat it when it doesn't even taste good? You know it's bad for you anyway. Shit, what else do I still do that once brought me happiness that doesn't anymore? What else in my life is junk food that I should stop eating?

Junk food= Masturbating. Used to be the tits, then my nose got stuffed... (shitty performance in bed, lack of energy/motivation), and it doesn't make me as happy as it once did. Yet I still do it. WTF?

Junk food= Spending money on socializing like I don't have to pay rent, school, food, bills, and gas. Nose got stuffed, (I couldn't buy my girlfriend's coffee this morning), and suddenly spending all that dough isn't as inciting. Yet last week I dropped 40 on beer and weed!

Junk food= Fucking reddit and facebook. It's like your brain's sucking a little dopamine teat. It's fucking addicting. Nose gets stuffed (you realize after a 4 hour redditing binge how big of a piece of shit you are, your grades lower), and suddenly you're a wiser internet user. That's the hope, anyway. Still find myself spending too much time on FB and Reddit... Ask yourself, is it as awesome as it was the first month you used it? Naw. But you still do it.

Tonight I think I made a first step towards being a more assertive person, and I wanted to share.

So I'm a server, and tonight a really pretty girl got sat at one of my tables.  As soon as I went up to the table she gave me a flirty look that made my heart race, but I couldn't really tell if she was telling me something with it or not.  The rest of the meal goes by and she seems much friendlier than a usual customer (and her friend with her) is.  Usually I wouldn't have done a thing being afraid of what might happen, but tonight I went for something new.  I decided to be a little more honey badger-ish and go after what I want, no matter what happened because of it.  I really just wanted to tell this girl that I thought she was cute, but didn't want to announce it in front of her friend and my other tables.  So I decided the best way would be to write it on her check.  I left her a note saying ""BTW I think you're really cute! ;-)""  I was done there, beaming like I had just stolen some honey from the nearest hive, I didn't expect her to do anything about it, it was really all about me being brave and telling a pretty girl she was pretty.  But when she paid with her check, she put her name and number underneath my note!  It was a total win, and *literally* all I had to do was be honest with myself and her, then write six words and a winky face. :-)

Anyway, I just wanted to share something that may help someone else out.  Remember how others react to you (like the phone number) is irrelevant.  The real reward is the feeling of freedom when you do what you feel, and the best part is it's entirely within your power to make yourself feel amazing!  Best of luck, fellow honey badgers!

A feeling of anxiety where I am self conscious about every minor action I make. This self-consciousness gets exasperated the more I am situated in my head and think about the regrets of the past events and unpredictability of future events. It is also increased around specific people and it’s making living life more difficult for me.

**Why do you feel this way?**

I think if I don’t do something right or pleasing to another individual that it will negatively affect what they think of me.  The funny thing is the more I overanalyze my thoughts and actions the more unnatural and forced they look when I am doing them. 

**Why do others’ thoughts of you matter to you so much?**

I want to be loved by others, but it’s still something I struggle to admit and believe. Deep down inside, a part of me knows I shouldn’t care about what anyone thinks of me, especially those that are not significant in my life, but at the same time there is a need to let individual’s around me affect what I think of me. I think this is a battle of my inner being and my ego.

**How do you get over this?**

Know that no matter where you are in life, what happens to you, your location in the world, there is only one thing that stays constant. YOU! As pessimistic as this may sound, your friends, lovers, families are all going to die at some unpredictable point. If you rely on those people for determining your self-worth you will be disappointed when they are gone. Not to mention, people aren’t perfect and can let you down at any point. The only person that can determine your validation self worth, and worthiness is YOURSELF. 

**Conclusion:**
From now on, try not to be situated in your head. Be in the present moment instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. The only obstacle between who you are now and who you want to become are not critics or uncontrollable circumstances, it is you. You are a fucking beautiful badass that can conquer anything you put your mind to and the only opinion of you that matters is yours.

""What if I don't get to do what I want in life??""
""So? I'm a changing person, and my wants and needs will change as I go through life.""

The point here is to stop the anxiety. Don't let that voice run away with all this nonsense about how failing this test means you're horrible and you'll never succeed or whatever... Shut it up with ""So?"" Eventually, you should calm yourself down off your hysterical track and come to a rational, calm answer.

This has been one of my best tactics for getting out of slumps and anxiety bouts. Don't feed that voice. Shut it the fuck up.

I'm not here to tell you that reading will make you stop giving fucks.

I'm not here to tell you that writing  or drawing will make you stop giving fucks.

Not giving a fuck is allowing yourself to let go. Saying ""yes"" to things. Trying as many different things as you can will help. 

""Happiness is like a butterfly- The more you chase it, the more it will elude you, but if you turn your attention towards other things, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder.""

Now although the comparison of happiness to a butterfly is rather cliche from Thoreau, it's one of my favorite quotes. Fucks will evaporate simply if you ignore them. Get it out of your head that you *have* to find happiness, you aren't really obliged to. However, as an entity you have to do something, so perhaps you should do things that you enjoy doing or actually want to try, instead of sitting vapid and doing whatever you're told (like I used to.). Maybe that's weight lifting. Maybe it's physics. Maybe it's meditation. Maybe it's playing an instrument.

I guess the message that I want somebody to hear is *do something.* It's was *right in front of my face for years and I never realized.* You can talk to all the girls/boys you want if you let go, realize that everything and everyone is beautiful, and time is so vast in comparison to the amount of years you'll be alive. Atoms are mostly composed of empty space. We are a small anthill of protons, neutrons and electrons, but we can do amazing things. 

If only we start saying *yes.*

The Fall:

First off, I found out I've been suffering from Lyme Disease for the past 15 years but was just diagnosed in 2012.  There aren't any Lyme Literate doctors in my area so it's not easy getting treatment.  

Also, I had a similar experience as Luke Wilson had in Old School when he came home from a San Diego convention to find out his significant other had been cheating on him.

I was in San Diego for a convention and a few days after I came home, my wife of 20 years told me she was going to go see a movie with a friend at around 11:00pm.  I said fine.  My 8 year old son woke me up at about 5:00am asking for his mom because he had a nightmare.  I looked over and did not see her there.  I tucked my kid back in and for some reason just figured my loving wife was just having a few after movie drinks or something.  It was really weird.  Maybe I was in shock but I didn't think too much of her not being there at the time.

The next morning, I asked her how the movie was, she said fine.  I asked her what time she came in and she said 2:00am and that she went to bed in one of the guest rooms.  I told her about our 8 year old waking up at 5:00am and that we didn't see her anywhere and brought up the fact that bars close at 2:00am.  She laughed it off and said she and her girlfriend were smoking cigs in her car into the early morning.

This shit wasn't adding up.  I asked her if she was out with some guy...if she was cheating on me...

At first she denied anything then she started crying and said about 8 months prior she was at a family reunion and started seeing...wait for it...her cousin secretly.  He is a married 40ish guy with 5 kids AND HER FUCKING COUSIN!  She told me the Vegas trip she recently went on with her girlfriend was really just a front to meet this guy.  She said they fucked all over Vegas.  In the Mirage bathroom, outside, in an elevator.  On and on...She also told me if this guy would leave his wife, she would leave me and the boys and marry him in an instant.

I almost threw up.

She said she didn't love me anymore and she wasn't happy.  This was all news to me.  I thought we had a great family going.  Two awesome sons (3 and 8 years old), great home, friends-the whole nine yards.  

Apparently, I was wrong.  She said she wanted a divorce.  I couldn't get out of bed for days on end.  I broke down crying at work and in my car all the time.  It sucked.

I then found out later that she also was fucking my friend/neighbor when I was in San Diego.  She would bring this fucker over to my home, with my sons there and after she put the boys to bed, she would fuck this guy in my house.  They did it for hours every day when I was gone.  I also found out, even after I came home, she would sneak out at night and go to his house and fuck.  

Who is this fucking woman?

I couldn't believe it.  I got the fuck out of Dodge and took my kids to my mom's house about 3 hours away to regroup.  She fucked him again in his car when we were gone.

We get divorced and put our home up for sale.  This period was hard because I had to live with her (she had no money or job skills and I didn't want to kick my kid's mom to the curb).  During this period, she put her profile on dating sites and would go on dates all the time.  I never did because I thought it was disrespectful and rude.  

After selling the house, I buy a new house and let her live there until she gets a job and gets some money saved.  She abuses me again by dating and talking to guys on the phone in front of me when she's a guest in my house.  

Again, I didn't want to see my kid's suffer by seeing their mom kicked the fuck out-so I put up with it.

After a few months of this, she gets a partial inheritance check for $100k.  I'm like fuck...life's not fair.  She is a fucking cheating whore and money just falls in her fucking lap.  

Eventually, she gets her own place and moves out.  She goes through several men and settles on one guy.  My kid's always talk about this guy and how cool he is and how much they like him.  I  cry sometimes because of what is lost.  I have little interest in work or social activities and I feel like I'm losing my kids.

Also, I turned 40.



The Rise:

I focus on getting my house in order.  I had never dealt with bills or anything so I learn all about that.  I sell my car and buy a new Infiniti. I sign up for meetup.com and join several groups.  Some of these groups are Divorce Support groups and I find them invaluable.  I discover I am not alone.  My problems are shared by others.  

I start working out and getting in shape.  I start doing Yoga and smiling a bit more.  I'm feeling more relaxed about things.

I went to a meetup.com ""Lock and Key"" event.  It's basically a setting to meet people and see if you click with any of them.  I met a girl there who contacted me later on that night.  We've been going out every since.  She is nice, loving, and caring.  

Bottom line.  I felt at one point there was no future.  Life was over.  All I put into the last 20 years was flushed down the fucking drain.  But as I bent over to look down that fucking drain, I discovered a light.  Dim at first but as time went on, it grew brighter.  

I would write more but I can't.  You see, I have to get in the shower and get ready for my girlfriend to come over so we can fuck like there's no tomorrow.  Because, one day...there won't be.

Peace Honey Badgers.  

EDIT:  I forgot to add-the night when she told me she went to go see a movie with her girlfriend....that was a lie. She was really out with the neighbor guy that night.

EDIT2:  Also, I wasn't bullshitting about fucking my new girlfriend yesterday. I really did fuck her like there was no tomorrow and it was awesome.

We believe that whatever we feel or think is our identity (and identity is something humans can't live without). But in reality our perceptions depend on our state of mind, and our mood and our mind are on various levels outside of our control.
 
The things we notice, the associations we make are very selective and a direct response to what our state is at that particular moment. Say you are feeling like a pimp, your brain will harkon back to all the memories where you did something awesome. Conversely, if you are feeling down and need to validate your self-pity you will go back to all the times you embarassed yourself.
 
 
We could say that we live under a trance that shapes the way we understand the world, but more precisely we live under a number of different trances throughout our daily lives.
 
 
Consciously understanding  this can allow us to begin taking control of our mind and aligning it to our objectives.

This is type one. It's usually bred from weakness and a need to NGAF in order to function. Everybody starts at Type 1. See, Type one is where you first realize the silliness in caring about things that are outside of your control. 

This leads to detachment from society and giving off the appearance of aloofness. Type one is where some people stay permanently. Type one is a riot shield, you hide behind NGAF and use it for protection. The riot will eventually stop and soon the shield will only limit you.

Type Two is where you realize that you don't need to masquerade aloofness or detachment to people because at a fundamental, deeper level, NGAF is about prioritization of your values. You've learnt the art of controlling your values emotions. Type Two's no longer use NGAF as a defense mechanism because they've made peace with what they thought was attacking them.

The unpopular truth about being Type Two is that it takes time. A significant amount of time. NGAF becomes a tool you use to tighten the loose screws in your life and the only way to tighten a screw is to use the right tool and apply the right pressure.

Don't get stuck in Type One. Walking around with a riot shield will eventually tire you. It'll limit your interactions with others because there will always be a barrier.

1. **Be Impeccable with your Word**  
Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the Word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your Word in the direction of truth and love.

2. **Don’t Take Anything Personally**  
Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won’t be the victim of needless suffering.

3. **Don’t Make Assumptions**  
Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.

4. **Always Do Your Best**  
Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.

[First post about her](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1bwyx5/til_a_woman_survived_a_bear_mauling_by_hiking/)

After this post she did an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1byn1l/i_was_mauled_by_a_bear_fought_it_off_and_drove_4/)

I'll give you a TL;DR of how its relevant:

She got mauled by a bear, like face inside the bear's mouth mauled by a bear. 

(The quoted parts are from her AMA)

&gt;But I knew that this was the moment of my death, and it pissed me off enormously. So much in fact, that it inspired me to fight back

She stuck her finger in the bear's eye and yelled for her dogs who helped her get away (they lived).

She made it to her car and even though she could bearly see she made it to the fire station, here are some quotes from her experience on that:

&gt;I only allowed myself a brief look into the rearview mirror, but it was so awful, I just laughed and kept driving. 

and
&gt;I'm not likely to live through this anyway, so here's my one chance to drive like a total dickhead with impunity.

Someone asked if she listened to music:
&gt;No music, just my maniacal laughter echoing off the canyon walls

The most NGAF move of the year:
&gt;When I got to the fire station, my big concern was that when they saw me, they'd faint, so I decided to try for levity. So I walked into the garage bay and yelled ""Honey I'm home!"" Then proceeded to give them every bit of personal informatin I could remember: name, blood type, shoe size...

She was thinking she was going to die and she laughed all the way through this ordeal. This is how to not give a fuck. If this little old lady (56 y/o) could keep her sense of humor throughout a bear mauling I think we can get over whatever petty problems we are facing.

As the artist who first broke free from the constraints of medieval and byzantine art, he’s considered the first genius of the Italian renaissance.

At the start of the 14th century, word of Giotto’s mastery reached Pope Benedict XI in Lombardy. The Pope sent a courtier to Florence to see who this Giotto was, with a view to commissioning some paintings for Saint Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican. The courtier first travelled to Siena to collect designs from other masters. He then went to Giotto’s studio in Florence and asked for a drawing to take back to the Pope. Giotto took a canvas, dipped his brush in red paint, pinned his arm to his side and drew a perfect circle with his hand. He grinned and said ""Here’s your drawing"". The courtier, feeling mocked, asked for another drawing. Giotto replied ""This is enough, and more than enough."" Although he suspected that he was being taken for a ride, the courtier took Giotto’s drawing back to the Pope along with the other masters’ drawings. The courtier explained how Giotto had drawn the circle unaided, and the Pope and his advisers realised just how much Giotto surpassed all the other painters of the era. Giotto got the job"".

Having about 45 minutes to kill, I figured I would just sit back and watch the events unfold. Normally I wouldn't say a word and just listen. I'm the type of person who doesn't like a lot of attention on me in large groups, but once you get to know me, a blast to hang out with. So I did my normal thing and just sat there. 

After about 5 minutes of not one of the 60+ students stepping up to break the ice, I finally said **Fuck It** and started off the debate. Now it's important to know I an atheist (probably more anti-theist, but I respect people's rights to believe what they want). The preacher didn't know what hit him. Being in Texas, a Christian super giant state, I don't think he was expecting some of the questions I asked him, and my rebuttals to his points. I was clearly ahead in the argument. 

Not only was I winning the debate, but I was winning the crowd. Whenever I would make a point, people would clap, I started putting humor into it, and everyone laughed. I had the people on my side, and where as normally all this attention would make me sink back, it empowered me. 

Sadly though my next class was about to start, so I had to leave the debate early. I politely gave the man a hand shake and said, ""I have class now, but this a great deal of fun sir"", but as I walked away, a number of people asked me my name and if they could get my number so we could meet up later because they wanted to talk to me about atheism and just be able to pick my brain. I met some really cool people and it looks like I formed an entire new circle of friends because I said fuck the shyness and was not afraid to debate my world view to this preacher in front of a crows of 60+ (Around 90 by the time I left).

I had been told from a young age that if I wanted to go to college, I would be the one paying for it.  So I did.  Every single cent of college was on me and my head.  I went out and earned scholarships.  I worked two jobs.  And I did well in classes. I got into a good college and worked four years to earn my degree. And I did it all without a loan.

Now, hey, graduating from college, doesn't everybody do that nowadays?  Well, you see, that's only the start of my story.  The real beginning of my story begins the day before I graduated.  It was the day I received an email from my department head informing me that I wouldn't graduate.  

Now, clearly, this was something I give a fuck about, having devoted my time and effort for four years to achieve this goal.  I drove two hours from the city I was in simply to meet with said head of department and see what the deal was.  You see, I had actually earned 150% of the required credits for graduation.  That's right, boys and girls, I had done the effort for one and a half degrees.  Six years of work in four years, while working two jobs.  So I was slightly pissed about being told I wasn't graduating when I had indeed satisfied all the hoops they put me through to earn that piece of paper.

Of course, if you have any knowledge of school systems, you will understand that most of them are political bureaucracies.  Mine was no different.  My department head had no idea why I wasn't graduating, and forwarded me to the people who were issuing degrees.  They referred me to something a dean of my major had said several years back.  Several years in which policy had changed and said dean had left and been replaced.

Of course, the word of a student is not to be trusted.  Why would they?  So I fought.  Not in a literal fisticuffs way, but by their system.  Why?  Because I was right.  I went back with what they said, got approval for it, and then got his boss, the dean of the college, to vouch for me.  I then went back to the people denying that piece of paper I had worked so hard to obtain with signed letters from the dean in the deans hand.

They recognized me the next day when I picked up my diploma.

The moral of this story is that this subreddit is not about NGAF about anything at all.  It's about NGAF about what others think of you and what they say you can and can't do.  You can, and indeed, should have your own goals to pursue for your own personal fulfillment.  You just shouldn't give a fuck for anyone or anything that gets in the way of you achieving your goals.

Building yourself up to be able to talk to anyone takes bravery and wiliness to escape your comfort bubble in order to realize there's nothing to actually be afraid of. 

The good news: **you can work up to it one step at a time**.

Here is how you level up to fearlessly talking to anyone. 

* 1. Look at everyone. 
* 2. Make eye contact with everyone.
* 3. When you make eye contact with someone, smile. 
* 4. When someone smiles back, say ""Hi,"" ""Hey,"" ""What's up?"" Any generic greeting. 
* 5. When someone says hi back, ask them something. 

That last part is the big secret. Don't know what to say to someone? Give them something to say to you. If you're just walking around: ""How's your day going?"" At the bus stop: ""Where you headed?"" At the bar: ""What'cha drinkin'?"" The sooner you get people talking about themselves, the more comfortable they'll be talking to you. Show interest. 

I believe it was Judith Martin (Mr. Manners) who said the core purpose of etiquette is making other people comfortable. Don't focus on forcing social interaction or saying the right thing. Instead focus on yourself: try to be a person who's chill, who's comfortable to be around, who doesn't put pressures on others or expect things from them.

It has been said that the most powerful of men is one who has mastered his emotions. In my case, I wish to master fear. In other words, I want to give zero fucks. Some of the information may be nothing new to you, but here is my letter to my future self to help along the way: 

**Fear:**


Fear is a peculiar animal. While it will convince you that you are going to die, it will also keep you alive. Yet, in all cases, whether you are scheduled to speak in front of a thousand people for the first time, or you are running from a bear, the physiological response to fear the same: FIGHT or FLIGHT, STOP or GO, adrenaline, cold sweat, pale skin, nausea, vomiting, fainting. Therefore, fear is conditioned by our situations to occur in situations in which your *mind* believes you will die, regardless of whether or not *you* believe you will die. Although it may be silly to consider, the fear of public speaking is actually the fear of death, the fear of social death, rejection. We know we won’t literally die in an interview for our dream job, but the mind doesn’t. It treats the situation equally.

**TL;DR Giving fucks is natural.**



The tricky part is finding out how to teach the mind that it won't be killed in a non-lethal situation. Logic would tell you (as many have) that all you have to do is to “get over it,” “be fearless,” “be confident” or “be yourself.” But sometimes it seems impossible. This makes sense because if we were to decide decide, suddenly, that we weren’t afraid of bears or cliffs, we would get ourselves killed. 

**TL;DR How to give zero fucks is confusing because brain.**



Now, you look at the world and you see certain people that thrive in social situations, make killer speeches, outrun bears and fly. How do they do it? Well, like intelligence or running speed, we are born with a certain give a fuck temperament. But talent only goes so far and fearlessness can be learned with time. You’ve got to work with what you’ve got and the best time to start is now. 

**TL;DR Start learning now.**



What now? Sometimes you’ll look back and notice that your give a fuck level increased dramatically in a certain situation. Focus on that situation and seek to understand where the fear came from. Sometimes, like forgetting where your car keys are, we simply forget to be fearless. If something was there at all times to remind us to be fearless (e.g. a coach, or a director, a friend, or even a job requirement) then we would probably be more adventurous in the short term, and become more kick ass in the long run. The reality of it is simple: You must subject yourself to the fear. You must find a way to remind yourself to be fearless, and seek out situations that require such. In other words, fucking go out and do it. Start small if you have to. Start big if you want to. Talk. Speak. See. Discover. You may find that the process is quick. You may find that it is the hardest thing you have ever done. When you get in trouble, just remember, they put a fucking robot on Mars.

**TL;DR Find out and seek out what makes you give fucks.**



I have been shamed by my social insecurities. I have avoided opportunities for fear of failure. I have alienated people for fear of rejection. For my entire life I have struggled to rise above my own mediocrity. I have taken my time for granted. I have not deeply loved any soul, including my own. Worst of all, I have been content to blame others for these issues. 



**Not any fucking more.**

To this post, your comments, advices, and inspirations I will often refer (should you provide them). I foresee a long and arduous process and it starts today. Please offer your theories, ideas, disagreements or whatever you would.

**To this goal, to be fearless, to be myself, to love myself, to love others,  to give zero fucks I pledge myself.**

Mark my words; OP will deliver.

**My fellow Badgers. I am back to report on my status.**

**_**

Although the past 3-4 months have been grueling, I have, without a doubt in my mind, overcome the most significant of my fucks. I've studied, read, learned, tried, focused, and fought to overcome my fears. I've put myself out there either to succeed or fail more times in the past several months than in the span of my many years. I can hereby clarify–for those of you who doubt the possibility–that yes. It can be done.

**_**


This is not to say I don't have my downs–we all do. It is to say that the *ratio* of my ups to downs is dramatically improved–consistently better.


**_**
  

  
Although there is little evidence that I can provide, I can begin to tell you about my new life. I have joined several new clubs. I have begun acting, singing, and performing again. I have begun writing the screenplay I thought I'd never start. I can speak with my Dad without worrying about disapproval. I can be alone with a stranger and shoot shit. I can ask a girl for her number without having a seizure. I can speak in front of people without having my heart shut off my brain. People that I have known for many years tell me I've got a new ""spark"".



**_**
  

Everything lies in the ability of your mind to overpower the natural fear that exists in the subconscious. We have been given the gift of reason, and reason, in all its wonderful paradox, is powerfully effective against even the mind that created it. You must find the ability to will away your fears.

1361827544.0,253,self.howtonotgiveafuck,197qx7,How Ecstasy changed my Personality,trannygirl15,347,94,129,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/197qx7/how_ecstasy_changed_my_personality/,"Let me start by saying that I'm a computer nerd. I wear glasses and write lots of code. I get some social anxiety when I'm in noisy public places with lots of people. I'm also a very calculating person. I have a hard time being spontaneous and ""letting go"". I also have a tendency to stress easily.

Recently, I was at a huge music event: lots of people, very loud music. A friend of mine was visiting from another city and had brought someone else along (let's call her Sarah), whom I was briefly introduced to. I instantly found Sarah very attractive. My spidey sense told me that Sarah found me attractive as well, but unfortunately, both of us were too shy to say anything, and very few words were exchanged. I felt embarrassed and withdrew to go have a drink at the bar by myself.

About 20 minutes later, I run into my friend Mandy. She tells me that her boyfriend happened to give her two ecstasy pills, and that she's looking for someone to take one with her, asks if I'm interested. Having started to embrace the honey badger within, I simply respond with two words: ""fuck yeah!"". I spend more time talking with Mandy and others, having a very relaxed time. The ecstasy slowly begins kicking in, until I can feel its effect in full about 45 minutes later. Ecstasy is a peculiar drug. For those who have never tried it, I would say that it has the effect of removing all discomfort, both mental and physical. It's extremely relaxing and confidence inducing. Unlike alcohol, it doesn't seem to make me any less lucid than normal.

Later in the evening, I happen to run into Sarah at the bar. I don't waste much time, I tell her I find her very attractive, and ask if she wants to dance. We dance for a brief moment. My spidey sense tingles again, I'm convinced that she's totally into me. All of a sudden, I blurt out: ""Would you like it if went down on you?"". It has to be the drug. I could never say something so blunt normally. I just hope that this won't end with me getting a very hard slap in the face, and fortunately, it doesn't: she gives me her hotel room number. I did end up going there later that night, and had a very good time with her and another girl (!).

Perhaps this is a bit of a crazy story. Clearly, ecstasy makes people very confident, perhaps dangerously overconfident. What I learned, however, is that sometimes, being confident can pay off big. If I'd been shy, and had not even spoken to Sarah, she would have gone back to her home city and I might have never seen her again. I also learned to trust my intuition. I was convinced that Sarah was into me, I could just feel it. I could have been wrong, but repeated experiments since have made it seem that most of the time, my intuition is accurate.

Furthermore, I think I learned what it feels like to be an extrovert. People tend to attribute personality purely to one's upbringing... But by ingesting the right chemicals, some switches can be flipped in my head that change me from shy introvert to [NPH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JInZ0BItb7k) in less than an hour. The important lesson here is that it's all in your head, and your personality is not unchangeable. I rarely take ecstasy, and I wouldn't want to be taking it all the time, but I can remember how I felt when I was on it, how easy everything seemed, and channel some of this, even without the drug.",Revelation,False,,t5_2tna8,1361844020.0,revelation,,True,t3_197qx7,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/197qx7/how_ecstasy_changed_my_personality/,

The problem with this philosophy is that it is only Step 1 of learning to NGAF and applying it to your everyday life. So often on this subreddit people assume that Not Giving a Fuck is about apathy with respect to difficult situations. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Not giving a fuck is about disregarding barriers that inhibit you from achieving your complete freedom and complete potential.

Not giving a fuck therefore requires action. Disregard the problems that are currently limiting you but ask yourself what you can do to transcend the situation rather than ignore it. Not giving a fuck and living life as you always have is merely an inoculation against the symptoms of your problems instead of reorganizing yourself to root out the cause.

Want to overcome social anxiety? Mediate. What to get over a significant other or family member that is causing substantial stress in your life? Find a way to distance yourself or limit their impact on your happiness. All circumstance require YOU to take ACTIVE steps at improving your own happiness.

First, one of my favorite parables:
** **
**A boatman is rowing upsteam and sees another boat, far off, moving downstream directly towards him. He yells: ""Hey, watch out! Change your course, asshole!  Look out!""  The boat, however, continues to rush towards him.  The boatman is seething, this isn't how things are supposed to be done, he's giving 1000 fucks.  Now as it comes closer, he sees that there is nobody in the boat.  His anger immediately dissipates and he sets to correcting his course as best he can to avoid the unmanned vessel.  Is he going to continue to yell at the boat to change its course? No.**
** **

Ramakrishna, a famous mystic from the 1800's, said, *""The one who is angry is like a boat which has no captain. When you see there is no captain, steer away. Don't stand and throw words back at the boat in anger. Steer aside. Otherwise neither boat has a captain.""* 


In modern terms, I think of this as ""the cost of doing business"".  I want to live my life as freely as possible, engage the world outside my home, range far and wide and remain open to experience.  I know that I am going to experience boats rushing towards me that have no captain -- angry drunks looking for a fight, manipulative people looking to get something from me I am not freely willing to give, lovers with whom expectations and boundaries painfully fall out of alignment. 

Why is it so important to NGAF in these situations?

Simple -- you've got the best chance of **steering around them** with a calm, clear mind that completely accepts the presence and possibility of failure, problems, and unfulfillment of desire.  

Some additional quotes from some of my favorite authors that help illustrate what I'm talking about:

**Alan Watts:**


“Life is like music for its own sake. We are living in an eternal now, and when we listen to music we are not listening to the past, we are not listening to the future, we are listening to an expanded present.”  
** **
“When we attempt to exercise power or control over someone else, we cannot avoid giving that person the very same power or control over us.”
** **
“One is a great deal less anxious if one feels perfectly free to be anxious, and the same may be said of guilt.” 
** **

**Robert Anton Wilson**:

""You are precisely as big as what you love and precisely as small as what you allow to annoy you.""
** **
“I don't believe anything, but I have many suspicions.""
** **
""In conlusion, there is no conclusion. Things will go on as they always have, getting weirder all the time.” 
** **

Two books that I highly recommend by Alan Watts, and that are highly digestible: 

[The Wisdom of Insecurity](http://www.amazon.com/The-Wisdom-Insecurity-Message-Anxiety/dp/0307741206)

[The Book: On the Taboo Against Knowing Who You Are](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Taboo-Against-Knowing-Who/dp/0679723005)

I give this latter one away too often to ever retain a copy.  


 

Finally, a shout out to J.R. Bob Dobbs, without whom [slack](http://www.subgenius.com/) would have been far, far more difficult to attain.

**TL;DR**: Maintain an internal locus of control and focus and understand why you are not giving fucks as opposed to just how to not give them.

I talked to this girl today and I simply just asked her how her weekend was and I got a good 10 minute conversation out of it. It feels good knowing I can pull this kind of stuff off. 

I was laying in my bed last night and a thought crossed my mind that really stressed me out but I relaxed came on here and read a couple stories. You guys inspire me to be the best I can. You guys give me that extra push to make me go across the scary jump called life but guess what? I'm not scared anymore. 

I love every single one of you honey badgers.

I started off working in kitchens as a dishwasher. In case you don't know, dish dog is the low man on the totem pole, but nobody really messes with them, because nobody wants to do that if they quit. I actually liked it. Turn on the music, load up the wrack, dirty dishes in, clean out, wax on, wax off... you get the picture. I would actually use the time to go over my college homework, write paper outlines in my head, and even design D&amp;D worlds, all while my hands were busy.
Eventually, I got promoted to prep cook, then line cook, etc... and moved to a bigger, better paying kitchen. I still loved cooking and enjoyed being in the ""zone"" when tickets were flying in and out, food was perfect, and you got to drink a case of beer after work with your line buddies. I was good enough to get promoted to sous chef, and took the job, even though it meant an actual hourly pay cut with more responsibilities.

I was good at this, too. Cut overtime hours in a huge kitchen, streamlined food cost and made sure people took pride in the food and service. I even nutted up and fired the racist, lazy bitch who threw temper tantrums in my kitchen. 6 nights a week, 60+ hours, and I loved it. Things were great, I got a few awards, it was awesome. Then I asked for a raise. ""Sure, its in the works"" was the reply for about 8 months. Then they switched bosses, I started off at square one with the raise. ""Oh, yeah, we're working on it. I have to talk to the guy, and he's only here every 3rd Tuesday"", or some other bullshit. 6 more months of this, then I say ""Look, if you can't get me a raise, take me off salary, and I can at least get overtime."" Done.

So I kept doing the job, even though I made the same pay as the line cooks, but was responsible for the whole kitchen. At least I was making more money. They hire another sous chef, at a salary much higher than my old rate, and I ask if I can get that salary as a sous chef. ""Well, you have to apply for the job,"" which I had been doing for 5 years. ""Fine, I'm no longer a sous chef. Find somebody else to close the kitchen 6 nights a week. I'm paid the same as a line cook, so that's what I'm going to do now.""

Time passes. I am back on the line, still happy, but much wiser. Another new boss, and he starts trying to bully the staff. I, as a former manager, know what is and isn't allowed by company policy. People start coming to me when they question his instructions, I tell them what the actual policy is, and what they can do to counter him. Chef, understandably, doesn't like somebody challenging his authority, but most of the people we work with don't speak english too well, and he is abusing these people in ways that are clearly not allowed in the employee handbook. Stuff like forcing people to use vacation time when they don't want to. Offering overtime early in the week, then cutting it later on. Ignoring time off requests, etc... not stuff you get sued for, but stuff our company frowns upon. My outspoken defiance gets me transfered off the line and into the ""steward"" position. I don't care, company can't cut my pay, and I've got so many years there, I get tons of benefits, plus I no longer work nights. Awesome. Angry that I haven't quit, Chef tries one last thing to get me to quit. Dish room. I couldn't believe it. I was the highest-paid dishwasher in town, never worked a night or Saturday, and nobody ever fucked with me. Chef would come into the dishroom, expecting to see me elbow deep in some shitty, burnt pots. Nope. Everything clean, I'm miles ahead of the workload, and I have a smile on my face. I know it doesn't seem like a dish best served cold, but it felt pretty good to ruin that bully's attempted revenge.

That was years ago, and I've since moved on. I now design home solar power systems for a company I founded last year.

I won't bore you with the story, I'll skip right to the point. A shitstorm happened, I gave a fuck about it and the fuck made it worse. As soon as I realized it, I stopped giving a fuck and I started cleaning up the mess. Things immediately improved.

Diminished fuck distribution is not going to happen overnight. There's no single moment when suddenly your life is magically better forever. You'll still be a god damned human being who will continue to instinctively react emotionally to shit that doesn't matter.

It sounds simplistic to say *the best way to stop giving fucks is to stop giving fucks*. I know as well as anyone that letting go is neither easy nor permanent. Shit will hit fans so long as the world contains both fans and shit. The urge to freak out and give a fuck will spark time and time again, and you will have to remind yourself each time that fuck distribution will not in fact clean up any shit.

My point, aspiring honey badgers, is that there's no moment of euphoric enlightenment. Not giving a fuck is a journey. Learn from the fucks you've given and the shit you've cleaned. Life is *never* going to let up on you, because it's *fucking life*. The next shitstorm is already coming for you. All that matters is how you face it.

I wish onto you, young honey badger, that you find the strength and focus to face your next shitstorm with a mop and not a tantrum. Remember that at least one person out there knows how hard it is to just let go, but that person believes you can do it.

My friend and I are in an acoustic rock cover duo and had just played one of our best gigs ever at a local winery. The response was very good from everyone at the venue and we made out pretty well money wise. After we packed up all of our equipment back at my friend's house we decide to head out to get something to eat. This is when my friend informs me that my ex-girlfriend texted him saying that she was in town. At this moment I got mad because I hate it when she texts my friends.. But then I got to thinking, does it really matter? No.

So we get to the diner and when we are seated by the waitress I see a bunch of people from high school that I could have ever gone without seeing again all seated in close proximity to me. It turns out their bands had a show the same night in the same town at a really crappy venue and they ended up here after the show. They immediately make note of my presence and start talking about me and what not, and again I got to thinking, does it really matter? No. I said hi to a few of the people that I had been friends with at one point and just stopped talking to and when I greeted one girl she told me that she hates me, and again does it matter? NO!

What I took away from last night is that I really can't control how other people behave, people will act in really stupid ways. The only thing YOU can control is how YOU respond to the situation. If I had really wanted to go full alpha I would have gone up to the biggest jerk in the group that I've had the largest history with and acted like nothing ever happened and start asking him about what he's doing professionally with his life, which I know is nothing. But, my friends it's small steps to becoming a true honey badger and last night was the first step for me. I hope you found this enlightening and inspiring and if not, IDGAF.

I still carry a lot of that weight today, but I didn't realise it until earlier tonight. Also, please remember that this is solely my experience and certain pieces of advice may work better with some than others. I urge you to at least read the tl;dr though.*

I don't know if I was ""addicted"" to Facebook by its definition, but I sure as hell spent *way* too much time on it for no good reason - hell, there is never a good reason to waste your days doing what I did. I would scroll an empty feed (I unsubscribed from literally everyone), going through posts concerning equal rights and inspirational quotes, because that's the kind of person I want to be. I want to be fair, compassionate, confident and strong. Facebook had just stopped me in my tracks and I didn't even realise it until I got rid of it. The first few days were horrible, like quitting smoking or drinking. I got ""withdrawals"", but mostly I hated myself being on there anyway so I was partly motivated to keep away.

I unsubscribed from everyone because I hated seeing them so happy. I've been spending the past few years growing, changing, learning new things about life and people. I just got out of my first exclusive but short-lived relationship, which I still sometimes have trouble thinking about even a year later. After I lost my first love, I started losing everything else, as I thought to myself. 

Before that, I had experienced a degree of bullying. I had a close friend for the best part of four years, ages 9 - 11. It was awesome, I was always the one trying to entertain people and I loved it, not a problem in the world (excluding the occasional schoolgirl fights and whatnot). Penultimate year of elementary/primary school, she suddenly stopped hanging around me. She went over to the ""popular"" people of the school and bagged me with them. Now that I think of it, I believe it might have been influenced by her mother's coercion to hang around more ""decent"" folk? I don't know, her mother had some high status in the school and was in good with the principle, and my family just went through a divorce and we've always been poor.

I was alienated from everyone, and I spent my lunchtimes reading a book or walking around. Even the teachers hated me for some reason. I was pretty much hardwired to believe that you had to fit a certain standard set by these ""popular"" people to have friends. I obviously never fit that standard, even when I tried. They dared a guy to ask me out and dump me the next day - I was 11, like I cared. But to be put in that kind of position still made me feel like some sort of circus freak - I was that weird kid and I didn't even know it, even with their ongoing attempts to make me look absolutely foolish over anything I ever did.

This continued throughout my first few years of high school but I had a lot going on at home as well. My biological father (I'd rather call him Dan) was emotionally, mentally and sometimes physically abusive. There is definitely something wrong with him but his superiority complex is at a point where he believes that *everything* is wrong except himself and I can't exactly drag a 55 year old man into a psych's office. I lived with him after my mum stopped paying attention to me, neglected me at worst. From ages 13 to 15 he was pretty much my go-to person, my only parent. He has the mindset of a child and argues like one with a temper. Incessant yelling, mocking me in a baby-like voice (even when I told him about my panic attacks), many bad memories. Again, I was made to feel unimportant and irrelevant to anything.

Moved back in with mum when I realised how abusive Dan had become, or perhaps always was. Mum seemed to have calmed down, although to this day almost four years later I never figured out what caused her to act so dodgy. She was dating a lot at the time, I don't know. I don't want to think about it really. This aroused a lot of mistrust, especially since they were always shit talking each other when I was starting school.

I was depressed throughout school, and when my ""friends"" started disrespecting me and labeling me ""the sensitive one"" (I am actually hypersensitive to criticism) I transferred for a fresh start. Year ten - new friends, new boyfriend. My problem with the relationship was the fact that I relied completely on him for my source of happiness. Our break up was not related to the quality of our relationship, but it still hit me where it hurt and changed me for life. I started perceiving relationships and people differently. I was more compassionate and I had a desire for a relationship in a different, more valuable form than your stereotypical high school partner. But wait, if I feel like such a wreck, how am I supposed to get some thing like that again?

During our relationship, I said a lot of immature and biased things that I'm too ashamed to write here. I simply had low self esteem and I continued to maintain this ideal that didn't have any bad feel to it, e.g. I didn't approve of him calling me babe because I thought it was scummy. This linked back to the standard I had to fill out, which had changed slightly over the years in retaliation to the bullying.


**The whole entire point of this post**; I didn't realise the most part of **anything** I wrote above until I deactivated and reflected on myself. I reviewed my general behaviour and thought of what I liked and didn't like about myself. I wanted to change the things I didn't like that were changeable, so to change that I had to figure out why I had certain problems (anxiety, depression etc.). Traced it back to previous experiences. Discovered/rediscovered old memories and affects. Rationalised with some, need help on the others and connecting more dots. I've booked an appointment with a counselor from a large youth mental health corporation because I want to make myself a better person so I can have a better life.

**My current take on FB:** It looks pretty much the same to me, excluding perspective. I activated it for a few minutes to see if I have school tomorrow. I looked at everything on the page and scrolled down the feed a bit. Nothing had changed. That sort of reminded me of when I was caught up in Facebook all the time - no matter how many times I was saying it, no matter how much I insisted it, **nothing was changing**. All I did was wait for something, and I waited for years. I now perceive Facebook as a prison at worst and an addiction at best. I'm not looking at escaping my problems and imprisoning myself in a standstill world, I'm fucking changing my life and Facebook is a cunt that only contributed to my issues.

**TL;DR: My advice that I urge all of you to take, and please hear this out. Your experiences outside your mind are *always* affected by what's going on inside your mind. Don't blame others for bullying you, don't blame others for making you feel insignificant. Blame yourself for taking it in the way you did. I'm not saying berate yourself, it's just a way I found useful for me to take initiative in my mind rather than letting outer influences outside of it control me. In a more accurate context, realise that your problems are internal, and it is your choice to make whether you internalise certain things. Differentiate your emotions from your reasoning, because only you know the truth about your own experiences and no one else does.**

People have an affect on you because you let them. Think about it. Even if you didn't know better when you were first taught, you do now. And it's completely up to you to take initiative and change your situation. I reiterate: outer experiences are the results of our thoughts. Change your thoughts, and you will change your life.

You wanna know how to stop giving too much fucks for things that are not worth it? Your (lack of) partner, your weight, your confidence, your job, everything?

Stop thinking.

Seriously. Stop thinking about it.

You think you look like shit, then stop thinking how much you look like shit and start shopping for new clothes. Stop thinking how bald you are and start looking for, say, wig, or grow out your hair. You think you're fat, so start jogging. Don't ever think about it, just start doing it. You think you're nervous around people, then stop trying to impress them. Stop trying to look cool, and start doing things that would make you feel more confident. Look at people in the eye and don't break eye-contact. Take classes, start a fight club, talk to strangers, drive fast, go to the fucking gym. These things help. Not thinking help. Move around a fucking lot and try to do badass things like taking martial arts classes or rock climbing or whatever. 

Adrenaline rush is one of the best things that I've ever discovered, and that's coming from a girl who didn't know how to drive when she was 20. 

Now I'm much more confident than what I've ever been in my whole life, and I managed to do it because of jogging and driving. It's the little things, it's the persona that you're trying to build. It's about mind control and not letting negative emotions rule you over.

Don't ever think about people who don't want you, instead do things that would increase your confidence. Watch movies and see how your favorite heroes are doing, how they speak, their hobbies, their mannerism, and then start mimic them and in no time you'll be sauntering around with overwhelming charisma.

I wasn't always a honey badger, or the pursuit of being a Honey Badger, and I’ve turned my entire life around by serving in the Army. I’m a 20 year old medic, and my life comparatively to my friends, burnouts and just people feeling stuck, I made my own path. Life is too easy, so square yourself away regardless of you. 

Love and pain are the most binding forces on earth. Look your fellow person in the eye. 

Take criticism with a grain of salt; don’t get offended. You are God. 

Take advice. 

Take college; if you don’t have time, drive to work ten minutes early and educate yourself. CLEP test on things you know. Complacency Kills. 

Don’t expect anybody to do anything for you, ever. 

Fuck the assholes; be nice to them. Fuck the Sham artists, tell them what they are. 
 
Stay at work late?
Fuck it; you're too smart to let confusion take over.

Scared of dying? 
On the Cosmic scale, you've spent the universes' course not yet born and you will spend the rest of it fucking dead. You’re already dead. 

Push your mind and body. Make yourself tough. Find energy inside yourself. 

Don’t abuse drugs, don’t depend on anything but bread and water. When you can get up at 4 and run 10 miles without sleep you get confidence no one can shake. Habits are inevitable, but Charlie Sheen it. If you should stop, stop. You always know when it’s time to. 

Fuck living every day the same. You’re having financial issues? It makes you tougher, smarter, look at you.  
Perception. Perception is everything. The single most important thing is to know what you’re doing, or look like you do. What you want to do and be, begin it. That promotion, that girl/boy, that book, that old friend you see in line. Don’t let your ego make you want to change the past before falling asleep.

The girl in question is a 19y.o female who is a loner and has few friends IRL. Typical friendzone scenario. Also straight up rejected by her once, just in case you were going to ask me to confess. Yes, I stayed on for a few months even after the rejection. She has also dropped cryptic hints via social media that she is pining after somebody else. Yes, I am an idiot.

My dilemma is this: three good friends of mine have told me on three separate occasions that the best option to do is to just avoid her. That also appears to be the most repeated advice that reddit has to offer on the subject of friendzoned guys.

And ya know what? I actually took that advice to heart. I don’t seek her out, I stopped logging into the IM program that she uses, and I try to put as much distance between me and her as possible during lectures.

Problem is, I cannot stop her from seeking me out on occasion. She only does it on occasion (“Can I join you for lunch?”), but I can’t bring myself to just say “No” to her, for the simple fact that she has very few other people she could possibly hang out with. And this wouldn’t be so bad, if not for the fact that hanging out with her makes me feel like shit afterwards (being reminded of what you can’t have).

She may only be hanging out with this obviously smitten guy to get her fix of social interaction/confidence boost, but I can almost understand why because a) I was such a dumbass that I chose to “stay friends” even after she rejected me and b)her loner nature has won her very few friends in her time here. Avoiding her almost makes me feel guilty, because who else has she got to turn to? Another voice in my head slaps me at this point, though, and says “So what? Even if that were true, you’re only bringing this up because you’re putting your brain where your cock is. You’re not her boyfriend, you have no obligation to keep her happy. If she’s lonely, that’s her problem”. At which point another voice in my head slaps me and says “Now you just sound like an asshole”.

As it is, I can see 3 options available to me:

1.	Return to our “normal friendship” and just hang out with her again. This option is obviously one that I don’t feel like taking … The few months where we were “just friends” felt fun, sure. But it also felt like torture, where I had to constantly fight for her attention.

2.	Confront her. Tell her upright that it is impossible for us to be friends and that I want her to leave me alone. I feel guilty enough just avoiding her normally, what more telling her to get lost … ?

3.	Continue as is. Avoid her where possible, but put up with it and act friendly when she comes to me.

We cry at sad movies, laugh when people fall off motorbikes while trying to jump off of a homemade ramp. We frustrate ourselves and also calm ourselves. But, we are not the sole dictators of how we feel.

We often let other people affect us in non-positive ways. I want to first stress that it is alright to be influenced by people, have emotions toward people…all that jazz, but it isn’t healthy to allow how others treat you, what other people say to you, how they act around you to influence how you feel. If someone that is close to us, a sibling, a SO, a close friend is in a bad mood, don’t let their bad mood become a reflection in your own attitude. If they treat you badly, act unkind, and say vicious things you can’t harbor that inside. It isn’t you, don’t take it personally and DON’T make it personal.

For the longest time, and I admit I still fall short, I let how people saw me affect how I saw myself. If someone was mad at me or ignored me, I would feel the worthlessness sinking in. I allowed people’s rejections of me eat away at my sanity. Did I do something wrong? Do I not look good enough? Why am I not smart enough? Enough, enough, enough.

Set exceptional personal expectations. Expect to be disappointed with others and by others, but expect yourself to not let it define you.

This past year my bipolar mom moved out, and so we got to move and I changed schools! This was awesome because I was pretty much known as the awkward girl who never talked. I was dealing with a lot of crap, but deep down I felt worthless. Talking to others was risking too much. I decided to try and be social because damn, friends seem like a cool thing to have! 

First I started talking to a lot of smartypants sophomores who were in my classes. Because they were just sophomores I honestly didn't care what they thought about me. I realized that I was able to make small talk a lot more easily, and by winter break I was hanging out with them a bunch and started to be friendly with people in my actual grade. At first it was terrible, I'd cry and shake before any type of social event just out of anxiety, but I pushed myself forward. I also joined orchestra, and a some clubs. I now have a couple really close friends, as well as a bigger circle and it just feels fantastic to feel like I belong and that I'm valued and that I've plans each weekend. 

No one really cares what you look like or how you talk or what you say. Just relax and have fun. No one is out to get you. By having more friends I've realized that everyone else is just as insecure and that they deal with bad problems too. As stupid as it sounds, getting new clothes, and learning how to do basic makeup also really helped to boost my self esteem. Everyone should feel comfortable in their own skin. I look cute as hell and I am cute as hell and it doesn't matter what people say because it doesn't change what I am. 

To love is to be vulnerable, to love is to give yourself away, to love is to trust. Fear? Fuck that! Accept that you are scared, but do whatever you want to do anyways. Don't ever hide away any part of the amazing person you are because you feel less than wanted.

Right now, in this moment. I've been a short time lurker here but I do not have the problems portrayed in this sub *anymore*. That is why I'm here to help you, because I possess of something that *will* push fear away.

* 

First up, let's picture a classic scenario real quick. It's you, in a confident mood sitting at a cafe when you suddenly spot a *beautiful* woman sitting two tables across from you. You just noticed her quickly glancing at you while discreetly touching her hair and giving a smile to you. The signs couldn't be more obvious. The thought of asking her out suddenly becomes existent. Your heart is by this time beating as never before and absolutely nothing else is on your mind except this woman. 

You've just become a predator. A predator that *has* to catch it's prey or if not, you will be the prey. Because that is what it feels like. You are calculating every move that you could possibly do wrong and how it would end up. In your mind you know that it's just a rejection. If she says no, its not much to it. But it doesn't change anything. The emotions are taking over and it feels like you are going to fall through the floor if she rejects you.

This continues for *twenty* more minutes and she gives up. She's gone, perhaps forever. And now you are feeling so messed up. Putting all the blame on yourself, because who else? You're after all the one who messed up, wasn't you?

* 

Nope. It wasn't *you* that messed up. It was the mistake that messed up the whole situation. The mistake of not asking her out. This is the first thing I need to address to people in this subreddit, that I see all the time. 

*You are not your mistakes*, and for gods sake, stop identifying yourself with your mistakes. It's the most stupid thing one can do. You doing mistakes is just another term for you *learning new stuff*, advancing forwards in life. If you don't learn, what human being are *you*? Ask yourself this question loudly. 

And as an added note, people don't even remember your mistakes. Not at all actually. They are already to self centered and busy to cover up their own mistakes, that *you* don't remember. Remember?

* 

What I told you I possessed of earlier in this text, is what we are going into right now. It's not some secret that only I know of, because it's *knowledge*. Some fundamental knowledge on how the brain works and functions, also known as *psychology*, that will make fear totally irrelevant.

Do you remember sitting in the cafe all up in your head thinking about that woman? Two things are happening at that moment. Firstly you are possibly objectifying the woman. Thinking of her as an sexual achievement once you've conquered her. This is something you have to quit doing. Imminently. Secondly, you are in your conscious mind trying to convince yourself to talk to her. But something is preventing you. It's your unconscious mind.

So basically, the frontal lobes of the brain takes care of your consciousness. The thoughts, the actions and the decisions you make every day. However, compared to the whole brain, the frontal lobes doesn't cover much activity. Because the rest of the brain, the unconscious parts, takes care of 70% of the overall activity. 

So when the unconsciousness is in charge of so much, it needs a way of communicating with you, to influence you in your decisions. 

This is where emotions play it's part. Emotions form when your unconsciousness is talking to you. It wants you to feel happy after achieving something so it releases dopamine. The same goes for when you are feeling anger towards someone who have done something very stupid. It's just chemicals being released into your system.  Just try to back off, wait a few seconds or eat an apple. The chemicals will go away. 

It also wants you to feel fear if there are dangers around. Like a lion or a rhino. 

However, this fear was created for the said lions or rhinos. Today, you don't have these dangers. The fear was made for thousands of years ago, and of course the brain hasn't developed for 2013. That would take hundreds of thousands of years. So now the brain is feeling fear of rejection because there's no real danger around, and your fear is simply dysfunctional as of today.

Why would you feel fear towards approaching someone? A long lasting relationship or a one night stand is among the best things on this earth. Compare getting rejected and dying on the savanna. There's no connection. That is why fear of rejection breaks all logic what so ever.

 So snap out of it, today. Life is to short to be controlled by irrelevant fear.

Here is the sentence:



""Worrying is like praying for what you don't want.""



I think a lot of y'all fervent atheists would especially like this (reddit is full of them), because you can relate to the absolute uselessness of praying yet at the same time see that worrying is like the same thing: the thoughts you spend on unwanted events have the same real-life effect as thoughts religious people direct toward wanted events. Which is none.

However, we should all keep in mind that if we direct our consciousness toward being open and positive then your reality will likely reflect that in time. 


Just some sleepy ramblings of a 4:00 AM redditor. 

Edit: Personally I don't deny the many beneficial aspects of prayer. However there are many redditors who seem to be rampant atheists. And for these people, prayer would probably not do much. If a Christian prayed to the Muslim prophet Muhammad I do not think said Christian would benefit much, simply because they do not believe in Islam.

She's pretty much the most awesome girl I have ever met. However, I am DEEP in the friend-zone. In fact, its pretty much the brother zone. So anyway, we are both in college now, and live about 7 hours away from each other. So this past weekend, I visited my hometown just to see people, and she was there. I have been battling these emotions to tell her for a couple years now, and the past few times I have gone there, I was seeing signs that, to me, said there might be something there. So I decided before going there that this would be the weekend I would tell her. Just to see if there was something there, or if my mind was making it up. So, we had a movie night, just her and I, and after about 20 minutes of mental preparation, I flat out asked ""Could you ever see us being anything more?"".

""No. I can't look at you like that""

Just like that. Boom. Done. Didn't touch on it again and she ended up falling asleep on the couch, and I took off and left the following morning. Damn, it hurt. But on the drive back, I realized something. Now I know. She is my best friend and now I know that it can't happen between us, and I just want her to be happy. And strangely, I'm fine with that! You guys must have rubbed off on me, because right now, I can't stop seeing all the positive in the situation.

I really don't feel like going into details, but for an instant in my life I thought my death was imminent and I accepted it. I thought that I was saving two people by dying myself, but nobody was gunned down in the end.

In those brief days after the incident, I started thinking about life and realized that I needed to turn my life around. To start to not give a fuck and enjoy myself more. The thing is, I have started to care less, I really have, but it's a slow and painful process. 

The thing is, I want to get out there. I want to meet people. I want to date a beautiful girl and make her laugh, but I just feel like I take life way too seriously. I feel that I have forgotten that I once got so close to death that I accepted it, that nothing really mattered. I want to live like nothing really matters. Especially what other people think.  I really need to get motivated, to work out, to care for my friends, to take care of myself, to love my parents. I want to call the girl I really like and tell her that I want her but all those things seem so far away from me. 

I suffer from anxiety, I feel that the walls start to collapse whenever I start to care about my friends again, so I need you guys to tell us how to enjoy life a bit more. I don't know why I suffer so much. My family loves me, I have good friends and I'm relatively well off, but I just can seem to get a grip of myself.

Something that's helped me was what my Nan used to say to me. I have no idea if it's a famous saying or not though.

Imagine all your problems as cars. Your mind is a bridge. If you try to deal with all your problems at the same time all your cars will crash into each other. Breakdown. If you take one problem at a time then each car can make it over the bridge nice and slowly.

I know it's not very HTNGAF-style, but I just felt like sharing it. Don't force your cars all over your bridge at the same time. Take it easy. One car at a time.

They want to not give a fuck what people think. They worry what their crushes think of them, they want to be accepted, but most importantly, they want to be loved.
It doesn't matter who it is (most of the time) we just truly feel free when someone accepts us for who we are at the deepest level; accepting our faults and imperfections knowing full well that we have them. 

Understand this... Nothing in life feels as good as this feeling!
As social creatures we need it; we need to be loved. We need it to be healthy, we need it to be happy. But I think people forget how easy it truly is to achieve this feeling, this acceptance, this love. 
Why not give yourself this feeling?
Love yourself.
Insecurity or giving too many fucks lies in the belief that we are not worthy of being loved, because of our imperfections, therefore we withhold love from ourselves. Then it becomes real, we really start to believe it, and then people inevitably see it. People see it because the world takes you at your own estimate. So if you don't love yourself why would anyone else bother trying to do something you can't do for yourself, especially when most of time they are worried about the exact same shit as you.
People are going to judge you no matter what. Always for the rest of your life. People are very literally going to hate you and say awful shit about you behind your back. I guarantee you they already have and they always will, till the day you fucking die and then they will talk about you anyway.  But guess what it doesn't fucking matter. Insecure people talk about others and that's how they make themselves feel less shitty. Great people, Happy people, LOVED people do their thing and don't give a fuck what others think of them while they are doing it. If you live your life freely and love yourself then good, like-minded, imperfectly perfect people will happen in your life and those are the relationships truly worth keeping.
So don't worry. Let go of the heavy lies you carry around that say, ""you're not good enough,"" or ""your too ugly,"" or whatever the fuck your useless lies are telling you.
It doesn't matter. 
Love yourself and you will experience life as it was truly meant to be lived. 
FREE


TL;DR - Loving yourself expels the need to give fucks. If you are comfortable with, and love yourself, beautiful things will happen in your life.

2. What people think about me doesn't matter.

3. I don't matter if i don't want to.

4. If i want something, i can achieve it, Just like everybody else, if i don't want to commit hours of my life to achieving this thing... it is my own fault and i should continue as i am. Until i decide to commit to something.

5. If i fail at something, i can either try again or leave it, it does not mean i am shit. 

6. Understand everything in life is a work in progress, failures in life = better understanding.

7. Prioritize. 

8. Do not judge, let human nature do its thing, there are 7billion+ people in this world, a large portion of them have a very different outlook on life, this is not their fault, this is not their problem, its not your problem, don't make it your problem. Someone says something that goes against everything you stand for... acknowledge that that opinion is there and continue without trying to change anything. ACCEPT THINGS AS THEY ARE and don't make it your problem.

9. Don't be selfish.

10. Acceptance, Understanding, Positivity and a certain degree of self contained  arrogance (so what if you think you are the dogs bollocks, you are, just keep it to yourself and walk proud in yourself)

a couple years back, i was in a fireworks accident.  as a result my face is a patchwork of scars, be they burns or bumps from shrapnel or other debris.  these scars are horrible to go into public with, but the worst is haircuts; mainly because it involves some random person being close to my face and touching my scars, which are extremely sensitive. as a result, i have a close friend cut my hair because he dosent gasp when he sees my face and knows not to be to rough when cutting my hair (he is a stylist and knows his shit).  

on to the actual story, well in a few days i have a wedding to attend, and needed a haircut.  my friend was out of the country to visit some family.  before i learned of this glorious philosophy, i would have just gone to the wedding like a caveman, or not gone at all.  but, i decided to get a goddamn haircut by some random person.  when i got to the place, the receptionist recoiled at me, i was going to turn my ass out of there but then i thought ""why the hell should i care what she thinks?"" i marched right up there and asked for a haircut. in a few minutes the stylist came over and sat me down.  while awkward for her, i didn't really care how she felt, and even asked her to mind the scars.  usually, i try to draw as much attention as possible away from them, but i just brought up their existence to some random person.  while she was more rough than my friend, it went well. 

it probably doesn't seem like a big thing to the people reading this, but to me this was the equivalent of skydiving for the first time, or something huge that i can't think of right now.

The last few years have been rough, her job has her traveling 4 days a week, mine is in town. In addition to the time away we have just grown apart in our goals, romance, interests and all the little things that justify the occasional work of being married. After 5 years of counseling I finally asked her point blank do you still want to work on this? Up to then, though I had some discomfort, I was willing to do the work needed to patch things up. I figure marriage is basically loving someone enough to give them an infinite number of second chances. Her reply was simply ""I don't want to do this any more"". I was and am sad that it ended. I also bought the motorcycle I wanted, picked out a new guitar, have a moving truck coming in 3 weeks, called my best friend in Austin who invited me to be his full time roommate in his huge beautiful house, informed my boss of my intention to leave at the end of the year on good terms, and started packing my household goods. I am going to move back to the coolest town I have ever known and start trying to figure out what makes me happy all over again. Yeah it is a little scary, but that is what makes high dives fun.

And that is Taoism. Yes, that's right, a semi-religious ideology, albeit an unconventional one. But the thing about Taoism is you can accept however much of it you feel like accepting. So feel free to downvote me, tell me to fuck off and be on your merry way. But, those who are still here, I'll just give you an introduction and send you on *your* way, and maybe do a multiple-post series if there's interest.

At the most basic level, Taoism is, like I said, the spiritual philosophy of not giving a fuck. Basically, a long time ago over in China when Buddha was telling people to give up all their shit and Confucius was giving everyone all these rules about how to live happily, this guy Lao Tzu was just like ""hey, why fuck with the world at all? You don't need to give shit up, you don't need to follow all this strict rules about respect and shit, just *let life fucking happen.* And then Lao Tzu wrote a book, and Taoism was born. 

The basic idea is that you just have to follow the direction you're supposed to go, and you'll be fine. Sure, Buddha's right, you shouldn't be greedy, but don't give up everything because that's fucking stupid. Sure, Confucius has got a point, you should respect your elders and stuff, but when you have too many rules it won't be long before shit gets crazy up in here. So just follow your own *tao*, your own way. If something feels right, do it. You know right and wrong, you're not an idiot. Let life happen. You do you. And that's it.

Now, there's a lot more to it than that. But that's the quick version. I can elaborate more, if you want. Or y'all can just go to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism) and learn that shit up.

I currently have a job, but have been attempting to move beyond it for numerous reasons. In the past I have always sweated interview, wondering if I was good enough, if was going to say the right things, if I was going to be the right person.

Not today. I am going to go in there, be brutally honest, be brutally truthful, and not give a fuck if they think I am the right person for the job. If the job is right for me, then it will be. I refuse to sacrifice myself and pander to people for another job that I can't stand.

Don't wish me luck, I won't need it. If anyone needs help it will be for the people who think they are going to get some run of the mill interview who expect a candidate to parrot all the right answers.

UPDATE:: The interview went well, but I don't think I got the position. It was the first interview I have had where I didn't try to justify some modicum of experience as a fullblown qualification for the job. I was honest, forthright and even told one of the panel members that I simply didn't have an experience with one of the questions they asked me. 

I walked out of there, and I felt really good about myself. I didn't try to supplicate myself, and it was probably the first interview I have ever had where I didn't feel like I was prostituting myself. I felt good about me.

Our host is a frequent attendee. He and I were conversing about something (I totally forget) when he directed my attention to the lightly-populated dance floor. A young gentleman was sort of dancing alone off to the side, not really aware of anything or anyone. He could have been on drugs, or not, whatever. Host turns to me and says, ""see that guy? That guy just does not give a fuck. Neither does he. Or her. Or them. That's what I like most here. You can can just be you.""

So I decide to hit the dancefloor and let myself go. Zero fucks given the entire time, didn't even care that my friends were watching me. Later learned I was the most drunk out of everyone. Still didn't give a fuck.

That was the first time I'd really let myself go like that in a couple of years at least. Divorce can do some serious damage to one's self-esteem and confidence. It was a good feeling to just not care for a little while.

Now to see if I can achieve the same state of mind without alcohol...

EDIT: As I read some of the comments, I should make a point that I don't encourage anyone to drink to not give a fuck. I have a bit of a drinking problem that needs to be addressed.

It is 1:00 in the morning, I’m fucking beat from school and work, and I’m desperately trying to edit my final paper. To make matters worse, my TA left some poorly written notes that are barely legible, which stresses me out even more.

All of a sudden it starts raining after about 10 weeks or whatever of non-stop sun (this is Vancouver, we're not used to long periods of sun) and then it hit me.

Out of nowhere, I didn't give a single fuck about anything that was on my desk. I simply didn't care about my TA's writing; I didn't even care about finishing this paper tonight.

Nothing really mattered to me during that moment. The feelings you get from sitting in the middle of your room with all the windows open, carefully listening to the rain as it hits the leaves outside along with the smell of damp humidity forming in the atmosphere; it reminded me of a handshake with an old friend. It just made me calm and happy, happy to be myself and happy to be where I am.

Sometimes you have to let things go and find inner peace inside of you. Don’t bottle up stress and emotions, simply say “fuck it” and set your mind free once in a while. In life, you can’t always critique everything, instead just fucking do it and as long as you have fun doing it, don’t let the approval of society and individuals get in your way.

The past two years I went I was always discretely on the look-out for possible boy-friend material, despite being the romantically shy, fine arts geek that I am. But, alas, the past two years, while being fruitful in wonderful friendships, did not turn up with a compatible 'other half.'

Now, I must say, despite my love of the stage and spotlight, I am not a good dancer, nor do I like dancing in public because of various self-esteem issues about my weight. However, there are certain songs that are impossible for me NOT to dance to, and while it may only be a slight hip swaying, I do find myself laughing and moving to the music.

Now, before the seminar begins each morning, the facilitator puts on some lively music to wake all of us up and get us to pay attention. Despite the bouncy music, however, on the first couple days everyone is either too awkward or shy to actually do anything about the wont to dance. 

At least, almost everyone.

On the very first day, the first song that was played was a swing tune, and I was itching to let myself go and dance, but I refrained and milled around with all of the other bashful participants.

And then someone starting dancing.

And not just bobbing to the music, this guy was fucking going at it, and he was GOOD. Really good. He was tall, tan, with impeccable hair and body and he managed to be a crossover of Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson, with a couple splashes of impressive Shakira moves stuck in, all at the same time.

By this time everyone is standing with their mouths hanging open and a couple people had started to clap. As I watched the urge to move grew and grew and with a sudden swell of that very special, 'AH FUCK IT,' feeling, I started to dance too.

Somewhere in the song we started doing a swing routine together and I managed to remember several relatively easy, but impressive-looking, swing steps that not only took other people by surprise but myself as well.

When the song was done everyone laughed and clapped and congratulated us. Dancer guy and I started talking and he told me he was thrilled someone had had the courage to get up dance with him.
Throughout the conversation we learned we had incredible similarities and that we both enjoyed each other's company greatly.

Today is our two year anniversary and I couldn't be happier. :)

I'm pretty introverted and not all bubbly and chatty like they are and per usual I find myself the third wheel in what had become a two-way conversation. But as I was starting to get down I said to myself: so what? This doesn't define my worth. For fuck's sake I don't want to gossip with them about our colleagues or trade opinions on hair salons or what the fuck ever else they go on about (which is always more of the same). I'll save my energy for someone who wants to talk to ME and about something interesting, for someone who sees my worth instead of looking right through me.  

I've been reading Eckhart Tolle's ""A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life's Purpose"" and it's really resonated with me. I'm going to recognize the common humanity that I share with these girls and enjoy the presence of my fellow human beings and I'm going to forgive them for being under the thumb of their egos and trying to bolster their sense of self through gossip and making others feel small because that's all they know. But I'm going to stand up for myself and anyone else when they're blatantly catty. And I'm not going to let my own ego define me by who wants to talk to me or date me, by how I look or what I like or how I spend my weekends or anything. Fuck you ego! You're not the boss of me and I'm starting to realize who I am is not comprised of your thoughts and I can choose to question them and shape them and fucking love myself.

I see a lot of *great* advice here, but I want to take it one step further in an attempt to really solidify the ""not giving a fuck"" attitude and set the tone for 2013. My proposition is this:

First, for the entire month of January, disable or give up your social networking websites. This is not meant to be permanent if you do not want it to be, but it does entail deleting apps from your phone, disabling your accounts, or simply avoiding all social network-related websites for the entire month of January. The goal is to re-establish the focus on yourself and to be out of the loop, so to speak, and to not give a fuck about what is happening in everyone else's life except your own. I have discovered that I feel a lot better *in general* when I take extended breaks or heavily moderate my activity on sites like Twitter and Facebook.

Second, make the attempt to recognize something that is unhealthy in your life and take the necessary steps to eliminate it from your life altogether. It can be drinking soda, smoking, a shitty friend, a girlfriend or boyfriend that isn't worth your time anymore, being out of shape, or anything else that you believe needs to change now, not later. I can not tell you enough that if you're on the path to not giving a fuck, that improving your own life goes hand-in-hand. 

And third, start a journal. Write down the things that bother you about your life. Are you sad? Are you overweight? Do you care too much about what people think? Identity what you want to change and then make a list of the things you can do to get to that point where you don't give a fuck. You're overweight? Join a gym. You don't get along with your co-workers? Fuck them; learn more than them, excel, be better than them. You don't know how to talk to women? Start talking to yourself in a mirror for 5 minutes every day and start from there.

This sub-reddit is all about encouragement, all about putting people on the path toward enlightenment, to find happiness. I really want 2013 to be just that for you guys because we all deserve to be happy. I think this could be a lot of fun, even if only one person tries any of these suggestions or tips out.

**EDIT:** Whoa, this took off. I'm happy to see this generating some good discussion. I suppose I should clarify that these are merely *suggestions*. Find what's right for you and do it. Overall, my main point is to take the initiative to improve your mindset and to improve how you view yourself.",,False,,t5_2tna8,1355798961.0,,,True,t3_14zzq1,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/14zzq1/i_propose_a_communitywide_howtonotgiveafuck_new/,

The start to getting a social life.",Zenoctilles,224,37,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/18qbpu/yesterday_i_decided_not_to_give_a_fuck_contacted/,"For much of my life, I didn't have a social life. However, it's not because I didn't have social skills - in fact, my social skills are actually quite exquisite. People at work remark at how good I am at interacting with customers and making them feel good. However, I never pushed myself to meet and hang out with people, and as a result, I never had any real friends outside of work.

I'm also a university student who's graduating this semester. Because I lived so close to home and needed to save money, I ended up living at home. For the past three (almost four!) years I was bitter and lonely at not having a social life while I was in college.

Granted, unlike what my title suggests, my life wasn't completely devoid of social activities - I often go to the meetups that my local My Little Pony fanclub often organizes, and have a few friends there. But for a while - nearly two years, I relied on that solely as my means of social interaction outside of work.

But, after a bit of thought, today, I started reaching out to people I knew from a long time back through Facebook. Good acquaintances I've met through my classes, cool people I've met at my university orientation, people I used to work with, etc. Basically, I scanned for names I recognized, thought were cool people, and sent instant messages asking if they wanted to hang out sometime.

To my surprise, plenty of people were quite open to the idea of hanging with a guy they hadn't seen in a million years. A lot of people remembered who I was and gave me their phone numbers, as well as invitations to call them up or IM them if I wanted to hang out with them. I did get a couple of ignores, but that's understandable, since there are a lot of people who've added me on a whim on Facebook after having spoken to me for only ten minutes and having gotten my name.

I got one good guy (who I had a class with and sat next to because I learned that he was a big gamer) agree to meet me today for a couple of beers at his place. I hadn't seen this guy in like two years. I met him, caught up with him, and watched a episode of his favorite TV show with him before parting ways. 

I've also managed to get a girl I haven't seen since freshman year agree to meet me on Thursday evening. So far, the ""getting a social life"" thing is going well so far, and I hope to make this a big habit in my life going forward. 

So, if you are lonely, reach out to people from your past. You may be surprised at who's willing to hang out with you. People are social creatures by nature. Facebook may be a strongly maligned tool, but it's also a giant address book, if you use it (I really didn't use Facebook much, I just kept adding friend requests). After all, Facebook is another tool, and it is what you do with it that counts.

My only regret is not having done this sort of thing earlier. But I suppose it's never too late to start - plus, I'm pretty young.

My entire life I had not been truly afraid of death, I usually told myself that I wasn't afraid, and that I would accept it when my time comes. But, last week, I began falling asleep at my desk and then all of a sudden, I had a sudden thought surge through my head as I was half asleep in some lucid-dream state: ""I'm going to die. It won't be right now, but it will happen. Time goes by fast, and before you know it, you will be 80 years old, laying in a bed, just waiting to close your eyes that one last time, and then it will be all over. No waking up; no dreaming. You will be gone, and you won't even know it."" I cannot explain it well, but it gave me a panic attack. I guess it was how I imagined/dreamed of myself dying; like a conscious death in first person. One example that happened as I was boarding the subway I unconsciously imagined how it would feel to be pushed under the train and it made me very paranoid the rest of the day. I thought it would get better after a night's sleep, and I'd be a clean slate tomorrow, because that's how it normally was: something bad happens one day, and you're made depressed by it, but by tomorrow you're completely fine.
I imagined, or tried to at least, me no longer living; no longer being conscious. Rotting away as people went on with their lives... And by that time I understood even more that the world may as well end, because I will no longer be able to perceive time. A second might as well be an entire life time in the wake of eternity. So every second I spend living, it's as if it's not even a variable. It's nothing.

I am, for some reason, scared shitless, and it doesn't seem like it will be going away soon like most of my problems do. I used to pride myself in believing I wasn't afraid, but when it happened that was the first thing I realized, and it replayed in my head no matter how much before I wanted to deny it: ""I am terrified of dying. I am terrified of dying. I am fucking terrified of dying."" I know I need to get over it, but I can't seem to do it. Everything after has felt very bland and fake. Even sexual encounters with my girlfriend felt fake, like a game or some shit. I have noticed a lack of opinion one way or another towards a lot of things. I haven't been able to enjoy one day so far even though I went to so many places with my friends recently.
I know this isn't something I cannot fix, so I must accept it, but I'm finding that hard to do again since my dream.

I would only have a few friends and it would be very hard to open up around new people. In public whenever I would say something, I would replay what I would say in my head before saying it from my mouth. Reason I'd do this is because I was afraid of what people would think when I would say what I wanted to say. Even now, when I do something as simple as order a burger from a restaurant, I have to repeat to myself, ""Hi I'd like a number 1"", before I go out and say it. 

It's pretty tiresome to have to constantly overthink everything which is why this place is a godsend. There's other people like me who are trying to not give a fuck! I've only been here for about a month but I'm getting better at saying shit I want to say without thinking twice. 

One thing I also learned is there's a very thin line between nervousness and excitement. For me I've always been nervous delivering a speech to an audience. The mere thought gives me chills up my spine, but now when I do it I just don't give a fuck and say the speech to the best of my ability. It's the most thrilling thing in the world to do something you absolutely dreaded before. I think this is similar to riding roller coasters. You're afraid of roller coasters as a kid, but then you learn how to let go and have fun when you're on it. Although for me I'm still deathly afraid of roller coasters since I have a huge fear of heights.

Anyway that's me in a nutshell. I used to hate being shy, but now I embrace it. Also for someone shy like me, talking to a girl is a really huge deal, so if I initiate a convo with a girl they are really impressed by it it seems.

Thought I'd give a little update on my NGAF development.

As has been sufficiently reiterated here, NGAF is about giving the proper fucks.  Or to put it in a less badass manner, being true to yourself.  While this is seeming simple, it is actually supremely difficult as many of you know.  For example, one short question will reveal one simple channel of how challenging this can be.

&gt;How can I know if I am being true to myself?

We lie to ourselves all the time, and assume autopilot modes of navigating the world, to the point that often it is impossible to actively recognize lies we tell ourselves.

Anyway.. I lived some life over the last year.  I've read some books.  I've made some mistakes.  And I have deepened my understanding.  Take this for what it is, one man's interpretations of his experiences.

Over the course of the last year, I thought I fell in love, but later I discovered that it was only that I learned how to completely accept and love someone.  I also learned what in means to exist in a state of love mutually with someone.  I've had sex with 6 women, but only with one was it transcendental and wholly loving.

Here is a list of stuff that have been important in shaping me over the last year.

1) Meditation.

2) Recognizing meaning exists outside of language.

3) Good and evil are present in every moment of existence.

4) Whether you recognize it or not, in every interaction you are intuitively deciding where the person you are engaged with is on the scale of friend &lt;---&gt;neutral&lt;---&gt; enemy.

5) The emotions you feel during communication are felt by more than just you, and are far more important than any words you say.  (see #2)

6) People crave relationships with other people who come from a state of love.

7) Confidence and peace are found within oneself, through accepting and loving oneself and then turning this same love and appreciation outward.

8) Trusting intuition on a more even plane with logic.

9) The importance of staying present.  If you are honest with yourself, you'll realize how little of each day you are fully in the present moment.  Even when you achieve a state of total presence, you'll realize how quickly it evaporates when a tinge of social anxiety creeps in or some ""problem"" presents itself.  Catch yourself, maintain your sense of presence, and full exist and be with everything/everyone that is in your presence.

When I first came across /r/howtonotgiveafuck, I thought it was some sort of highly pretentious place for people to post about their rude ignorance. I was terribly mistaken. I have been reading a lot of posts in this subreddit recently, and there are tons of relevent, enlightening posts regarding the HTNGAF mentality. 

In my opinion, if everyone lived with this mentality, the world would be a better place. People would no longer crave attention. There would be no anxiety. We'd all be happier, and we'd live in a happier society. But that's just my two-cents.

My real reason for posting today is to share a bit of advice that I just gained through a revelation. We've had really nice weather at my college all week along, and so I decided to go take a hike by myself. I took a walk through the woods for about 2 hours, going at my own pace and taking in the sights, sounds, and smells. I was taken back to the carefree nature of my childhood in which I would go outside and simply explore.

My experiences today got me to thinking about my life as a child, and my life of maturity and responsibility now. I came to the conclusion that it was my passage through puberty and adolescence around the ages of 13-18 that made me lose the ability to not give a fuck. When I was younger, I used to not care about what anyone thought. All that I wanted to do was be outside, be with friends, and enjoy every moment of it. After going through middle and high school, though, as the responsibilities piled up, I slowly lost this mentality. I began to worry about everything: what people thought of me, what work I had to get done, when and where I had to be at every point of the day.

By taking a hike today, I realized that if I could just simply return to the days of my childhood, my life would be so much more enjoyable. Obviously, I can't just give up on all of my responsibilities, but I can ease my tensions and aid my mental health by being adventurous sometimes and not caring if people like it or not.

So, that's my advice for today: go enjoy a nice day by walking slowly, thinking loudly, and smiling at nature.",Revelation,False,,t5_2tna8,False,revelation,,True,t3_1dp1kh,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/1dp1kh/our_passing_through_adolescence_is_what_leads_to/,

The article explains the difference between Loneliness and Aloneness. 

"" Aloneness is beautiful, it is grand. Loneliness is sorrowful, it is despair. On the surface, they look the same. But in reality, they are worlds apart. Aloneness is our nature. Loneliness is us running away from it.""

This struck me and I begun to really give it thought, I realized that 19 years of my life have been lived in hell for no reason. The article continues to explain how this correlates to ""Love"". 

""Once you delight in yourself, then – and only then – can you truly delight in the other. It’s a paradox, one of the biggest ones in the world. Only when you no longer need a lover; that is when you can find romance. Anything else is a sham, a pale imitation. ""A sham. That’s what the entire game of romance is. Who is our “romance” really about? Us, and us alone. We say – I love you. But what we really mean is – Please love me. Manipulation is all it is.

It clicked in my head that deep down I was just selfish. It makes sense. He continues to say...

""Lonely people cannot Love; they can only pretend to, for they have nothing to give. They only give a plastic love, in the hope that someone will give real Love in return. Everything becomes a giant game; a chess match.""

It was a wake-up-call and hopefully to whoever is going through the same thing, I know a lot of people must be, they even made a Meme about it http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/36ghyc/  I was good at giving advice because I viewed it deep down as a ""Chess Game"" I could tell how to strategically ""play"" someone, it's fucked up.

So now I'm trying to really love myself and accept my ""aloneness"" and not worry about love. If you are intrigued by this article you should check out his other stuff. His post on Ego was what started it for me, you should read it.

I work with him.  He's not the fastest at his job (retail), but he works hard and never quits or slows down.  Everybody loves working with him.  He always volunteers to stay late, always offers to go past scheduled hours to help out the next shift, is always willing to help other departments in our store, skips his breaks to cover others', and he is always smiling.

One day, I overhear a coworker of his tell him that many dislike him.  With a concerned, yet humble grin, he asks why.

""Loegan, it's because you're too damn smart, too good at your job, and always happy about it.""

He replies, smiling, ""You know what?  Fuck 'em.  If people dislike me because I put effort into brightening others' day and doing my best to have fun in an inherently solemn job, they can be downtrodden by themselves.""  He gives a large, warm smile and returns to work.  I always try to work with him.  He's hilarious and genius, really.  I hope his life doesn't remain at our store.  

Every once in a while, he doesn't have his happy-attitude.  It's never during a conversation, rather when he is focused on something he is doing privately.  I'll watch his warm presence fade, and a cold, sad one replace it.  It only lasts a few seconds until, after he looks down, immediately shows a Cheshire Cat grin.  I asked him about it one day.

""Sometimes, memories or sad things pop into my head.""  He says.

""Okay..."" I reply, ""but what makes you smile?""

""I do.  Any time I think about something that would depress me if I put much thought into it, or any time I feel sad because of a bad memory, I force myself to smile.  It helps the moments pass.""  Again, with a soft smile, he turns away to resume his work.

I began to pick up on it over the next few weeks.  Once I noticed it at first, I kept spotting his odd, yet seemingly helpful habit of smiling for no reason.  Curiosity wove me through its fingertips and I was, once again, compelled to ask him about it.

""Mind if I ask what the bad memories are?""

His face goes from inviting to stoic and back again almost instantly.

""What would you like to know?""  He says, turning away with a nearly laughing complexion.

""Well, what things continually make you 'force yourself to smile'?""

To this day, I wish I never asked.  Where once a kind and frilly person stood, a new man took his place.  Before me was a survivor of two suicide attempts, and a laundry list of interactions that would make most people never trust or love again.  Yet here he is, smiling while detailing his dark past to me in a grocery aisle.  Tears nearly spill from my eyes as he continues to, seemingly happily, tell me of his past.  When he's done, I'm speechless.  Many moments pass before I say anything.

""Are you ever happy, then?  Or is it an act?""  I ask, too harshly.

""That is something I WON'T tell you.""  He replies, a playful pout on his face.

""How do you do it?""

""What do you mean?""

""How can you act so cheerful and fun when you have such sad things running around your mind?""

""I ask myself some questions:

Does feeling sad or angry about it make me feel better afterward?

Does feeling sad or angry accomplish anything for me or others?

Does feeling sad or angry change anything?

In the end, is it worth feeling sad or angry for?

I'm a spiteful person.  I know there are people who wish to see me falter, see me cry, see me fail...but in spite, I do my best to remain strong, make others happy, and to succeed.  I'm doing my best to be the best because I can, and I will.""

It's hard for me to grasp the knowledge being dropped on me, at this point.

""It's as the saying goes, 'Kill them with happiness and bury them with a smile'.  I work out every day to achieve an image I want for myself.  I try hard every day because it will pay off eventually, be it a paycheck, a raise, a commendation, a reference, a happy employer or coworker, or just the piece of mind that I know I left no room for improvement that day.  I make mistakes, but they aren't permanent or drastic and can always be fixed.

And in the eyes of my enemies[people from my past], every day I don't fail is another day they have.""




I haven't talked to him much since then, we haven't worked together.  One thing he said really stuck with me, though.  It's hard to imagine that a person so tortured in his life is someone I aspire to be like, but it's true.  Rumor has it he's getting a raise several months ahead of time, and he's no better at stocking shelves than me.  He deserves it, and I'm glad that he could share those things with such ease and grace, and even modesty.

My sad memories, those who treated me poorly, those who anger me...my enemies...every day I succeed is a day they fail.  Every day I succeed brings me one day closer to the person I want to be.

http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/17dpao/some_perspective_and_advice/

and I was thinking about a Metaphor he had constructed ""You’re the sun amongst the field of tiny stars. You are the leader of your own subconscious."" I got to thinking about my life and how much I rely on other peoples opinions to formulate how I feel. I formed a deeper metaphor of how we watch the other ""stars""(Persons Personality's and accomplishments) We can build telescopes and see deep into the star, but we will never be able to visit or become that star. I then realized, I don't need to look at these ""stars"" when I am one. Some stars are VY Canis Majoris(Hollywood ""Stars"" or people who are successful) and yes it's easy to compare to them and feel completely and utterly insignificant. But as Whey said 

""If you compare yourself to the world, you will feel like nothing. You will appear as nothing. You will be treated as nothing. You will be, in fact, a number. But if you compare yourself to your past, how you have grown, your accomplishments and achieved goals, you will show to be very great.""

That's when I truly began to not only think but feel about who I am, I thought about what I'm good at. I've been depressed ever sense I graduated High School , but after thinking about it I INSTANTLY felt better, that kick shocked me, it was a true revelation and it was surprising how powerful my mind is. This kick coupled with all the advice I have picked up from my fellow Honey Badgers has truly turned my life for the better. I want anyone who feels like shit and has no self confidence to know that achieving self confidence is not a task, it's very simple you just have to ignore the other stars and look at yourself and notgiveafuck. A major component to me achieving this was a video I watched that someone had posted in the comments of another post about Mental Toughness- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1wEZZ5OWac 
Stop listening to the voices. They are not entities, they are you so don't tell yourself ""I'LL STOP LISTENING TO THEM!"" it's not a fucking thing, just stop thinking them, don't make another voice to make the other voices stop, just shut that part of your brain off.

This youtube channel is very good, I suggest subscribing.

I started it about two weeks ago and my life has changed **drastically** since then. 


I'm pretty shy and always fear people are looking at me or judging everything I do. I've been growing very tired of this and eventually found this subreddit by total accident. I saw the PM threads and thought, fuck it, why not? I did the meditation task first.

I came very close to not doing this task, however; I backed out four times and actually went back to my dorm before I realized ""Look at me, I'm hiding in my dorm because I'm afraid of sitting and doing nothing in public!"". I felt like such a loser at that point.

So, I eventually talked myself into trying again. I went to the court yard that is right in front of the main office campus building. It's very populated and always has a million students and teachers coming and going. At the time I decided to do this, it was more crowded than usual, mostly due to students packing up and getting ready to leave for the summer. There were a ton of people just chilling in the yard, talking, eating, etc.

I found an empty spot of grass and sat down cross legged. I've never meditated before but what the hell, figured I might as well look like I'm doing it even if I can't actually do it. I wanted to sit under a tree but they were taken from students trying to stay cool under the shade. I was in a spot that was very easily seen by anyone walking to and from the building. No one was near me and I was wearing a very bright neon green shirt. Picture a tall, lanky dude wearing a bright ass green shirt, sitting cross legged, and you got me. I stuck out like a bleeding thumb.

I have to say the first 2 or so minutes was down right terrifying. I was sweating and my heart was beating so fast, I felt like I was going to pass out. I kept my eyes closed those entire two minutes and kept my hands on my knees, trying to think about 'nothing' and failing quite hard. What finally made me open my eyes was I heard people laughing, and I was so scared that they were laughing at me.

But they weren't. I opened my eyes and found where the laugh was coming from. It was coming from a group of girls laughing at something another girl in the group had said. They weren't paying me any attention. And I looked around at everyone else and that's when I noticed *no one* was paying attention to me. No one gave a flying fuck about what I was doing!

At that point I calmed down considerably and went back to 'meditating'. Really all I did was keep my eyes closed and thought about how this really wasn't so bad for about 20 more minutes. It was pretty relaxing and afterwards I stood up and left, feeling very confident. One girl talked to me while I was meditating, and all she said was ""I feel the same way, buddy!"" before patting me on my shoulder and leaving to do whatever it was she was doing when she crossed my path. 

I've always been able to think that, logically, most people do not give a fuck about what you're doing so you shouldn't care, either. It just wasn't until I actually *did* something that I realized, holy shit, **they really don't care!**. I can't even describe how profound this knowledge is once you finally understand it. It's like someone gave me glasses and I'm seeing what the world really looks like around me for the first time.

This task made me try a few more when I came back to my parent's house for the summer. I ordered Mc Donalds when I went to Taco Bell, Burger King when I went to Mc Donalds, and Taco Bell when I went to Burger King. Normally, something like this would have made me so embarrassed (and I admit the first time I did this, it was slightly embarrassing) but  not anymore. The 2nd time I did this, another thing clicked for me. The people taking my order didn't *care* that I messed and ordered the wrong food. They either gave a polite laugh or just simply informed me I was at the wrong place. As soon as I said ""Oh, my bad"", they just continued on with their lives. 

They didn't ridicule me or grab a co worker and inform them of my mistake. They just said ""Next"" and did their job. Again, logically, I *know* that ordering the wrong food isn't a big deal, but experiencing it is totally different. It's a real ""Ah ha!"" moment, knowing that it isn't a big deal. By the 3rd time I did this, I knew I didn't need to do it anymore. 

Today, I went to the mall and bought the type of clothes I've always wanted to wear but was too shy of people I know making fun of me for it or just looking awkward (being tall kinda limits you on what you can wear). I normally just wear your standard jeans and a band t-shirt, but I've always wanted to dress in clothes from stores like Holister or Buckle. Most of my friends are against 'preps' and dressing that way, so this was pretty hard for me because I didn't want them to ridicule me. I went into both stores and while it was a bit difficult finding clothes that fit me, eventually I did. 

And I loved the way I looked. I felt fucking great! So great that I got a new hair style (cut off the 'skater boy' hair and got  something much more shorter and NEATER) and bought new shoes to go with my awesome new outfit. By the end of the day, I was so charged and confident that I ended up talking to a couple of strangers while waiting in line to pay for my shoes, and that has NEVER HAPPENED TO ME. **EVER**.

Of course, the big test for me was coming home to my friends and family and showing them how I looked. I will freely admit that by the time I pulled into the driveway, I wasn't feeling so great anymore; I felt like I was going to puke! But I kept reminding myself to not give a fuck. I told myself that if they cared enough to not be my friend over how I look, then I don't need them. 

I was met with mixed reactions. Sisters and parents loved it and couldn't stop gushing about how good I looked. Friends asked what the fuck was wrong with me and made fun of me. I brushed them off and acted like I didn't care (which, mostly I didn't at that point) and after a short while it just wasn't a big deal anymore and *no one cared*. Even my friends stopped poking fun at me and complimented me. 

My only regret is trying these tasks at the end of the school year, I really wish I had started earlier. Would have made that year a whole lot less stressful and perhaps I would have made more friends. Oh well, whatever. I can't wait to go back to school next semester.

**If you're shy and wanting to change, I HIGHLY recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and trying these tasks**. It might take more or less time for things to 'click', but eventually something will happen that will make you realize how pointless giving fucks really is and you'll wonder why you ever gave them in the first place. I still have a bit of ways to go (talking to strangers, especially girls, is still pretty intimidating, and I have still have trouble telling people 'no') but I'm definitely on the right path to Not Giving a Fuck. 

Tomorrow, I plan on going out and talking to strangers. I'm pretty excited, actually, and I'm hoping by next semester I'll be completely outgoing (or at least totally okay with interacting with people I don't know). Wish me luck!

When I got here, I realized that there was much more to it than that. Long story short, I end up seeing a Psychiatrist for weekly therapy, and after the 6th session, he disclosed to me that I suffer from crippling social anxiety. At it's worst, I skipped several lectures and countless meals to stay in my safe zone.

Since then, I've started Lexapro and continue to see my therapist. I've noticed a rather significant change in behavior, but today was an unparalleled victory for me. 

Today I had my second midterm in Calculus. Granted, I've never been as good at math as I'd like, but I've always been able to hold my own. Unfortunately, in dealing with my SA and, on occasion, secondary depression, I had let my studies slack in my classes. Thankfully, I was able to recover in all my classes... except calculus. So when the class started, I picked up my test, sat down, filled out my info, got up, and turned my test in completely blank. My professor immediately noticed and as I put my test down he asked what I was doing. When I informed him that I was going to simply take a ""No Pass"" in his class and retake it winter quarter, he simply asked my ""Why did I even show up?"" to which I responded with a shrug. He didn't take my treatment of his test kindly, and as a result, he had me sit in the front of the class for the remainder of the test. In the past, I wouldn't have fared well in that situation. I noticed my professor gather the other TA's and discuss something in a group. Were they talking about me? More than likely. Did I care or even think about it. Not at all.

Sitting me in the front of the class would have been my professor's way of trying to make an example of me, but I just did not give a fuck.

Unfortunately, there weren't enough literal trombones, so I ended up playing the trombone 2 part on a Euphonium/Baritone. Also unfortunate for me, I was a treble clef reader from the outset, and the music was in Bass clef. I've rehearsed, hard, for about a month, and I've gotten pretty damn good.

A week before the concert, the director asks for people comfortable to improvise their own solos in a sixteen measure space. I volunteered without hesitance. I practiced with the instrument, and up until the point of the concert where we played the piece which included the solo, I was shit-my-pants nervous.

I am overweight, and don't exercise much. I do 3 mile walks in my neighborhood once or twice a week, but other than that, not much. So when my friend asked me to jog with her, my first reaction was ""hell no.""

But then I thought about it. She's just starting jogging as well. I wanted to be a supportive friend. Going with her probably means something to her as well.

I texted her back. ""Sure. When?""

Today, at 10 am, I went jogging. I almost backed out every hour of every day. But I knew that if I wanted to improve myself, I'd have to start somewhere. So I started here.

""You're not wearing shorts?"" I was unprepared for this. As I said, I don't exercise much, so I don't own any of the ""proper"" clothes for the job. My day-to-day wear is a button down long sleeve shirt and jeans. My only two pairs of shoes are nice leather dress shoes and my trusty steel toe boots, which have saved my toes from bricks, knives, and shovels on more than one occasion.

""I don't own any.""

Thankfully, the jog was not that stressful. Two blocks walk, one block jog. I kept pace. It was fun. The last stretch, down a path through a field near my house, was the equivalent of three blocks. I jogged the whole damn thing, pushing myself to finish and keep up. I left my breakfast at the end of the path. Then I went home.

There isn't a day that goes by where I don't ponder the meaning of life (always to no conclusion), and while it is certainly frightening, it also comforting in a different way. Sometimes, when I catch myself a loop of thoughts that causes me to worry about my future, and how I think about how I'm currently so lost in life with little direction, I direct myself to the fact about how life is so meaningless. How we are born into this arbitrary consciousness and live out our lives over several years only to die in the end, just as others before us. And how the inevitability of humanity's extinction will only further attest to this meaningless. The universe will move on, with the entirety of our species only a miniscule and irrelevant speck of existence in its entire history.

Amidst my loop of thoughts, I realize this, and I am immediately swarmed with a rush of happiness and comfort. 'Cause you know, in that exact moment, I realize I just don't give a fuck. *None* of it will matter in the end. Worrying about the future will only bring me negative feelings. I'll just live events in my life as they come along. I feel like the only real meaning I can give to myself is to live a happy life, and if this provides me happiness, is it inherently wrong?

 If I could offer you only one tip for the future, sunscreen would be it. The long-term benefits of sunscreen have been proved by scientists, whereas the rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience. I will dispense this advice now.
  
   Enjoy the power and beauty of your youth. Oh, never mind. You will not understand the power and beauty of your youth until they’ve faded. But trust me, in 20 years, you’ll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can’t grasp now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked. You are not as fat as you imagine.

   Don’t worry about the future. Or worry, but know that worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum. The real troubles in your life are apt to be things that never crossed your worried mind, the kind that blind sides you at 4 p.m. on some idle Tuesday.

  Do one thing every day that scares you.

  Sing.

  Don’t be reckless with other people’s hearts. Don’t put up with people who are reckless with yours.

  Floss.

  Don’t waste your time on jealousy. Sometimes you’re ahead, sometimes you’re behind. The race is long and, in the end, it’s only with yourself.

  Remember compliments you receive. Forget the insults. If you succeed in doing this, tell me how.

  Keep your old love letters. Throw away your old bank statements.

  Stretch.

  Don’t feel guilty if you don’t know what you want to do with your life. The most interesting people I know didn’t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don’t.

  Get plenty of calcium. Be kind to your knees. You’ll miss them when they’re gone.

  Maybe you’ll marry, maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll have children, maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll divorce at 40, maybe you’ll dance the funky chicken on your 75th wedding anniversary. Whatever you do, don’t congratulate yourself too much, or berate yourself either. Your choices are half chance. So are everybody else’s.

  Enjoy your body. Use it every way you can. Don’t be afraid of it or of what other people think of it. It’s the greatest instrument you’ll ever own.

  Dance, even if you have nowhere to do it but your living room.

  Read the directions, even if you don’t follow them.

  Do not read beauty magazines. They will only make you feel ugly.

  Get to know your parents. You never know when they’ll be gone for good. Be nice to your siblings. They’re your best link to your past and the people most likely to stick with you in the future.

  Understand that friends come and go, but with a precious few you should hold on. Work hard to bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle, because the older you get, the more you need the people who knew you when you were young.

  Live in New York City once, but leave before it makes you hard. Live in Northern California once, but leave before it makes you soft.

  Travel.

  Accept certain inalienable truths: Prices will rise. Politicians will philander. You, too, will get old. And when you do, you’ll fantasize that when you were young, prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.

  Respect your elders.

  Don’t expect anyone else to support you. Maybe you have a trust fund. Maybe you’ll have a wealthy spouse. But you never know when either one might run out.

  Don’t mess too much with your hair or by the time you’re 40 it will look 85.

  Be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it. Advice is a form of nostalgia. Dispensing it is a way of fishing the past from the disposal, wiping it off, painting over the ugly parts and recycling it for more than it’s worth.

  But trust me on the sunscreen.

Not giving a fuck doesn't extend to things like your job and your grades- those are real things that you should give a fuck about because they will affect your later quality of life. Not giving a fuck is more geared towards things that have minimal physical impact on your life. These things are almost always social things.

For example, I wear my cowboy hat in public frequently. People judge me for it. I can feel their eyes on me. But I don't give a fuck. It's my hat, I'll wear it if I damn well please. The key to not giving a fuck is realizing that their opinion of you will not change the smallest thing in your life. They can think I'm a dipshit. They can talk behind my back. But my coffee doesn't taste any less rich because of it and when I take a dump it still feels just as good.

Not giving a fuck is about removing yourself from the social currents that rule everybody else's lives. Identify whose opinion matters- your boss, your SO, your children maybe- and worry about what they think. Their opinions will affect your life. 

The person you run into on the street will never see you again. Go ahead and pick your nose in front of him. That guy you sometimes run into at work/school? You know, the asshole who thinks he's better than you? What's the worst thing he will ever do? Tell someone you did something embarrassing? If they believe him, or if they care, chances are their opinion doesn't matter in the real world anyway.

Pick and choose your fucks, my friends.

What a great community. This is who I want to be, and how I want to live my life. I'd tiptoed around it for the past few weeks but not actually said 'you know what, I want to not give a fuck'. Inspirational.

I thought I'd share the story of going out clubbing the other night and not giving a fuck, not because it'll get mad props, but because of how happy it made me, and how happy doing something similar might make you.

The first step was getting a couple of beers with friends at your good old typical English pub, which soon escalated to cocktails in town, which soon escalated to going to a club. Now, this soon turned into me dancing and talking to this girl - I know, right? She was really cool and we spent a long time together, getting pretty close, but after a while she seemed kind of uneasy, looking round at her friends. Turns out she was from another town for the night and felt bad for spending time with me instead of them. I figured your typical douche would get pissy at her and grind her some more out of frustration, or take it as her shooting them down brutally, but fuck it, instead I just said in her ear 'it was lovely to meet you, go have an awesome night with your friends'. She smiled at me, and joined her friends. Felt good man.

After that though, it was about that time in club where the people hooking up had pretty much sealed the deal and were dancing together. The usual lone stragglers were doing depressing little single dances with their eyes glued to the floor, or sitting at the side looking sulky. My other friends had left, so I made it my personal mission to get them all dancing. I had a giggle dancing like a wanker in front of them, beckoning them up - they didn't all dance with me, but they all smiled or laughed. In the end I was there until almost sunrise with two guys I don't even know, bro-hugged the shit out of them, ruined my voice singing along to shitty music, and had the most fun I've had in a long time.

Maybe I'm overthinking it, maybe I'm looking back on this too much, but that night was the best clubbing night I've had in a long time. Yes alcohol helped, I'm not claiming to be free of all inhibitions magically. It made me realise that not giving a fuck isn't about giving you the confidence/security to be able to get laid, or to not look like a dick; it's the ability to not give a fuck either way, and to just have a great time. You should do so too, and have fun looking like a total fuckwit.

My consciousness is frequently dominated by me meticulously analyzing every detail of every interaction I have *over and over*. Sometimes I even think about things I did years ago - embarrassing things that I've said or done. Part of me knows that nobody else cares or is even thinking about it but the other half of my just can't let go of it. Sometimes I stay up late for hours remembering all of the stupid things I've done, and I can't stop even though I really want to. Often times, when I think like this, it tends to evoke intense emotional responses (crying, intense embarrassment/anxiety, anger etc.) as if I am completely reliving it just by thinking about it in my head, even if it happened years ago.

Most recently, I posted a note on my roommates door (we have separate rooms connected by a bathroom) letting her know that her alarm clock goes off at 12PM (she doesn't hear it because she is at work). It usually goes off for a about half an hour since nobody is shutting it off and I ignored it for a couple days (the note took a lot of courage). She wrote back but she misunderstood me and thought I meant at night (rather than 12 noon) and said that she check her alarm and it said it was off but she would keep it unplugged in the evenings. Now I feel super awkward and stupid because I should have specified it was the afternoon because she probably thinks I'm weird and crazy now because if it were at night clearly she would be hearing it too. So she probably thinks I'm just crazy or annoying or something. Plus what if it isn't her alarm. I mean, I kind of thought it sounded like it was coming from her room but maybe it wasn't. And in retrospect the note idea probably came across as super passive agressive even though it wasn't meant to be; I just used the note because I'm so shy but she doen't know that. I wrote her a note back telling her not to worry about it, specifying that it was the after noon instead of night, and that it may have been something else anyways. I wrote it out about 5 times to get it just right and almost took it back before she saw just because I feel so stupid and awkward. I've been able to think of nothing else for the past two hours even though it shouldn't matter and the rational part of knows she doesn't care and isn't mad and is just trying to be nice. But I can't convince myself entirely. 

Plus I'm so lonely. Its my freshman year of college and I hardly have any friends. I'm afraid of talking to most people because I'm so scared of saying something stupid and having to relive it for hours in my head. It takes me forever to get comfortable around people. I was almost friends with this one group of girls but I always got caught up analyzing everything and worrying that they didn't like me (the worrying and anxiety that I experienced probably made this true). They're all super assertive so me being really timid probably made them think I was pathetic. I don't care about being friends with them specifically but I do get lonely sometimes, even though I'm pretty introverted. I do have friends but its frustrating not to have anything to do on the weekends since the two friends that I have tend to go home for the weekend.

I'm sorry this ended up being so long.

I've always loved reading others posts because I feel like there are others just like me, giving too much, always hurting themselves to help others. But yesterday I had the most incredible thought about spending a little time not giving a fuck and actually trying to make yourself happy. Here goes.



Life is hard, and it always will be. If you have money, you're lonely. If you have the perfect family, you're poor...or lying. If you're attractive, you're taught that only looks matter, and if you're ugly, you're teased. People are cruel, all of them. Your friends will turn on you, boyfriends and girlfriends will cheat, people you love will die. And if I'm going to be completely honest? It doesn't get better, it just gets harder. With every bump in the road comes baggage, and with baggage comes a lifetime spent trying to hide your broken pieces from everyone you meet. The masks we wear make us feel stronger, and in time, the abused become the abusers, a sick cycle if you will. But with all that said, the world is beautiful, it's society that's corrupt. So I'm going to challenge you to something. For one week, spend an hour a day away from technology. Put down your phone and walk away from your computer and go explore something. Find something interesting, and study it, write a story, paint, build something. Find that one thing in this world to get you through this bull shit thing you call life. Because no, it won't change, but you can. Come back to me in a week, and tell me you didn't feel something. Maybe it'll be small at first, but it's there. The magic, the beauty, the wonderment. You can't catch it, or it will die, but you can become a part of it. You can grow with it, and you can remember how to feel alive again, how to feel freedom, and taste happiness. I dare you, because honestly? What do you have to lose.",,False,,t5_2tna8,False,,,True,t3_1duulw,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/1duulw/happiness_and_not_giving_a_fuck/,

This is my account of how my dgaf attitude attributed to one of my most enjoyable nights. So a little background, I just turned 21 about a month ago but never really felt comfortable going out, so tonight was my first night I really went out to a bar. Also I was fifth wheeling with my friends, which really put me outside of my comfort zone.
Since I was fifth wheeling, I wasn't expecting much to happen tonight. After an hour of drinks, we decide we wanted to dance, so I suggested we go to another bar that had a dance floor. When we got to the next bar, it was almost 90% latino. The thing is, I'm asian, so it made me very self-conscious about my race. Being single and all, the old me would've gave up and just lingered at the bar, but that's not who I wanted to be tonight. So I lead my friends straight into the middle of the dance floor and just start dancing my heart out. I DID NOT GIVE A FUCK. I just danced. And everyone on the dance floor noticed. Especially the girls. Five minutes into dancing, I had girls grinding up on me, while I was having the time of my life. I noticed the guys all standing at the edge of the dance floor pointing and talking about me, but I just kept on doing my thing. I had guys come over and give me high fives and the girls kept coming. Unfortunately, I had to end the night early since I had work in the morning. However, I'm glad I got out of my comfort zone and just didn't care what people thought and just had fun. It definitely boosted my confidence enough for me to want to go out again. So to all you honeybadgers out there, don't sweat what people think. The right attitude seriously makes a world of difference.

This post is to acknowledge the discourse regarding the quality of content in this sub.  I am aware and agree that the sub needs a directional shift.  We are brainstorming ways of reformatting or reorganizing the way content is posted.  We don't want to police too hard, not to mention most content that is posted here does deserve to be here, but it would be nice to see less ""how do i not give a fuck about my ex"" or ""i took a loud dump in a public toilet showing that idgaf anymore"" on the front page.

Keep in mind, that taking a loud dump may very well harvest a revelation of great significance in someone's life.  Don't judge that, think about it.

Secondly, it has been mentioned a few times that instructional content would be nice.  I think we could put together a FAQ of some sort.  I could put together a list of some of the texts that have changed my life.  But as to instructional content, one of the truths of NGAF in my opinion is that you make it your own.  No one is an authority on how you should live your life, well, except for you.  You are the creator of your life, and you must come to your own conclusions about NGAF.  If you come with a preconceived goal of adopting the philosophy, then you are missing an important part of it and this defeats the purpose.  I actually enjoy seeing all the different ways people make NGAF their own, and also how most come to an almost identical understanding.  Seems like it is an understanding within all of us, that we just have to find.

Lastly, I want to thank many of you.  It has truly been a joy to read many of the stories and thought processes here.  Your success in integrity and in living with less fear and being the best *you*, is all our success.  It has been a blessing to share this internet web space with you honey badgers!

I just asked a guy out via Facebook message a half an hour ago. We had been talking back and forth for a while but, when I asked, he saw it and didn't reply. Then I start browsing this subreddit for advice.

To be honest, it's hard to not take it personally because, even though he's not saying anything at all, he is sending the message to me that he does not want to spend time with me.

Something that helps me is to realize that he doesn't know enough about me to reject who I am as an entire being. He has no way of knowing all the awesome things I do with my life and how fun I am to hang out with.

He prioritized and made a split decision, like cutting class because you want to sleep, or taking a cab instead of the bus. Sometimes these decisions are great, and sometimes you end up missing out.

Use it as motivation to keep trying. I've been rejected five times in the past month, not because I'm repulsive or a bad person or anything, but because I've put myself out there to be rejected. So why should I be jealous of my friends who have never even attempted what I do on a daily basis?

The best part is that not only can I look back and laugh at it, but I've also gained valuable experience that'll help me attract someone really worthwhile. Until then, I tell myself constantly, ""Let's see how I can fuck this up. This'll make a great story later on.""

Oh. After composing this for twenty minutes, he responded and said yes to the date. I feel like a complete jack-ass, but the advice still stands. I'll probably need it in the future, anyway.

Acknowledging who you are and your problems can protect you against third-party criticism, and soon you won’t give a single fuck about it. Remember, giving fucks about who you are is a way to improve yourself, giving fucks about what other people say you are will only make you miserable. Accept reasonable criticism, respect other opinions, but remember: you know yourself better than anyone, and only YOU know what you want to become. 

I made the mistake of not following this simple piece of advice, and I suffered the consequences. I'm somewhat a depressive guy, the clinical problem. I’m overcoming it, but it is still a challenge. However, I can still think clearly and I’m able to feel happiness. I just discovered this now though.

Couple of years ago, I fell in love with a girl. Like, throw-my-jacked-on-the-mud-for-her love. She had a boyfriend who lived far away, and he was an abusive prick. They never met each other face to face. As you can see, she was miserable (or so I thought) with her life, but wasn’t able to break up with the guy. She said that I was her best friend, that she loved me, yadda yadda yadda. And I, stupid as it may sound, waited for her. I helped her with all my strengths without waiting for nothing in return, because I loved her. And she used this to exploit my weaknesses, to fulfill her life with gifts and company and affection without giving anything back to me. I tried to be strong, but misery was my everyday life. I really didn’t want to be selfish, but seeing their “relationship” was devastating. I lived like this for 2 years. No friends, no nothing. Just living with my illusion, thinking that someday we’d be together and happy.

When I reached my limit, I started to think about things. Bad things. And then I met this guy, who became my best friend. I still loved her, but he was trying to help me be happy for myself (or so I thought, again). He talked to her about me, tried to support her problems so I could get some weight from my shoulders. And then my best and only friend became friends with the girl I wanted to stop loving. Fast forward a few weeks, she breaks up with her boyfriend. Oh boy, that was awesome.  And then she said she didn’t love me anymore, that or friendship was hanging by a thread. And then banged my only best friend. And he went away (not physically), leaving me broken and alone.

And this is when I had enough of this fucking bullshit. I devoted myself to 2 persons who used me and threw me away when they didn’t need me anymore. My mistake was to value what they said so much. I followed their words like they were Gods, and completely forgot about my own opinions, my needs and my own sustainable happiness. I met another guy, I thought he was my friend, and he ended up calling me a loser and a piece of shit for being depressed. You know how depressed people react to this: with a rope around their necks hanging on their bedrooms. But this time, I knew how to act. And here’s my advice to anyone, anywhere:

Your friends are your friends. They are not parts of you, and they are not always right. Never give your trust away easily, save that to the ones who deserve it. Everyone else, well, fuck them. You should talk to everyone, respect everyone, but when it comes to real friendship, don’t trap yourself in some abusive circle. You have so little fucks to give, why throw them all at some creatures who live like social parasites, achieving happiness only through the misery of others? Keep your fucks to yourself, because if you give them to some asshole, he’ll try to suck everything out of you until you can’t take it anymore. 

Back to the beginning: Are you happy right now? Yes? Great dude, keep doing what you’re doing. You’re not? Ok, let’s work about that then. Let’s not give fucks about things by giving fucks about ourselves.

Are you feeling asocial, excluded from society? Search for hobbies you enjoy doing, and seek somewhere where you can do it with other people. Being awkward is just you giving fucks about what others might perceive of you. You can completely overcome that, just interact more. Get used to rejection, so it doesn’t hurt you anymore. Make new acquaintances, surround yourself with people that you find amusing and you’ll be happy doing what you like with people that you like. And the more people you know, the more you can enjoy! No one is a replica of you, no one will do EVERYTHING you like. By being open to new people, you can go to a bar with some friends, play some D&amp;D with another guys, go to a concert with someone else, study with some school colleagues, etc. Diversity will make your mind busy, and you won’t be able to place so much importance over someone, because there are too many people for you to do that. 

And, in the middle of this, you’ll find your true friends. And you won’t even need to give a fuck about finding them. The social exposure you’ll be getting will make it easy for you to find the ones to be trusted, the ones that deserve your friendship and that won’t suck the fucks that you shouldn’t be giving out of you. Bonus points: this will make you so confident around your opposite sex, really. You flirt, and s/he shows no interest? Well, 0 fucks given, at least I met someone new. S/He showed interest? Oh man, awesome. 
Use your tools to improve yourself, not to bury your problems or to complain about them. Reddit is so damn good! Want to get fit? Well, check r/fitness , r/loseit!  Want to broad your knowledge about anything? There will be tons of info about it around Reddit, seek them! You can improve yourself in ways that you can’t even imagine, just ignore that voice in your head that says you can’t. In less time than you expect, people will be admire your confidence, and you won’t even care about that, because you live only for your happiness, not to please your surroundings.

Saying 'fuck it' and moving on is easier said than done. Employing a strategy to this wonderful NGAF philosophy is more effective and executable. Therefore, I recommend actively noticing the number of seconds you spend giving a fuck, and if it's more than your allotted number of seconds, it's time to change your thoughts.

Try to do it even if it becomes uncomfortable, just see what happens. Notice how people react. Watch how people go about their lives under their own mental limitations. Notice everyone's binocular vision.  Notice how you are no different.

Looking people in the eyes is difficult for most of us, perhaps for many reasons.. You're afraid of an awkward moment. You're afraid of confrontation. You feel vulnerable. Whatever the reason, it typically comes from some insecurity or unsureness, and is in almost all daily cases a worthless behavior to avoid eye contact. We communicate so much with our eyes, why would we want to not use that resource?


This could stretch to more than just eye contact, as instead of being nervous in any way during conversation (including any tendency to try to keep the conversation moving for the sake of avoiding awkwardness), we can listen purely and observe so much more than we usually do.


But yeah, you have to not give a fuck to a degree to maintain eye contact like that.  And don't tell yourself you are making eye contact when you're not.  You know when eye contact is genuine and when you are just looking through someone.

Is everything you are doing in life worth it to you?

You have one shot, one arrow to split the one before you. One horseshoe to make a ringer. Are you doing your best? Are you enjoying life? Do you wake up genuinely happy or do you wake up to the grind? Do you spend the day happy or apathetic? Do you feel complete? 

If you answere those with all the grindy/apathetic answers then consider this. 

You have exactly today to live life. Not yesterday, not tomorrow. Today. And only today. Will you look at this and say, yeah, I had a great day at work! And can you answer that question every day of your life? Probably not. That's just life. 

But, do what you want. Constructive of course. YOLO. You Only Live Once. Think about. You may think it stupid or immature but it's true. Always be constructive. Don't go partying every weekend of your life with drugs and alcohol. Go skydiving. Go skiing with your childhood friend. Thank your parents for getting it on and birthing you. Go make yourself a better human exactly today. Not tomorrow and not yesterday but exactly right now. Right this fucking second when you read this whole post. There is only so much time and that time is gone now. Make it the best time of your life. 

Don't beat yourself up over not getting a promotion or getting that F. That money you COULD'VE gotten you probably didn't need. That F? You learned more than getting an A. Maybe you don't have a girlfriend. Use that time that you can focus on yourself, focusing on yourself. Better yourself. Go running or life weights. Maybe make out a better diet plan. I don't know. It's your life, live it your way. Don't let Mr. Bossman tell you around. 

It's your life, go live it right now. Also:

Are those dirty thoughts you think about Slutty Sally at work or Fat Joey st school really worth it? Maybe Slutty Sally has confidence problems and needs reassurance. Maybe Fat Joe has no friends an eats his problems away, befriend him. Befriend Sally. Always help those you can and don't judge them. Ever. The fact that you think yourself above another means you aren't. Everyone is pink on the inside. ""All worm food in the end."" think about that. Think about this whole post. Then act right now.

I mean, the occasional early bird special sure, and every once in awhile my all star player got lost and didn't show up for the game. But I know that that shit happens, and I never gave fucks.

But for some reason this girl, who is smoking hot and wonderful, completely throws me a loop. For every time we have had sex, we have had one failed attempt due to my performance anxiety. What the hell? Im 23, I am the NGAF guy, how the hell is this happening to ME? 

But no matter what typical NGAF mantras I chant and tell myself, I keep having issues. Each time I fail, more fucks are given, which increases my likelihood of failure. It feels like Im slipping into a spiral of fucks-giving.

 What gives?!? How can I NGAF about this one thing the way I do about everything else before it ruins my relationship?

I've had issues (and still do) with living in the past. The reason for this? In 2011, two friends whom I looked up to and was really close to were killed in a car wreck. They were 16 and 18. I had already had a cousin die at 18, a grandfather with cancer, and a father that had to have an emergency quadruple bypass. I sulked around for the longest time and I felt very depressed. It got to the point where I was sure I had clinical depression. I was in rough shape. However, not that long ago, I decided to change. I think this one interview I watched of Amy Lee (the singer of the band Evanescence) helped influence my decision. That interview talked about how her first album had lyrics that came out of this dark mood she put herself in. When writing the second album, she did t even see the point. She realised she could still be happy. So that's what I've been trying to do. I would always sulk around. I had a woe-is-me attitude. Nobody wants to hear that. We all have stuff that happens to us. I saw a quote that said life is 10% what happens and 90% how you react. I found this to be true. People say insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting a different result. Insanity is worrying about the past and expecting it to change. Whenever I dwell on the past, I ask myself why. There isn't a good reason. Today, I am 100% happier than I used to be, and I'm living life with some of the best friends I've ever had. When you dwell on the past, ask why it is more important to sulk about that then live a happy, productive life. If you find a reason, you didn't.

""So live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. Trouble no one about their religion;respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours. Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide.

Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none.

When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision.

When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.""

In the ass.,QuickestHipster,159,20,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/y7rdx/fuck_your_demons_in_the_ass/,"Firstly, let me warn you, this is going to be long. I would apologize for the length, but I don't give a fuck. Either read this for your own self-betterment or get the fuck out. Now that that's out of the way, I'm mildly autistic. I'm pretty high-functioning; I have friends and can effectively participate in most social activities. However, socialization is an extreme challenge for me. Whatever. That's not what this is about. This is about conquering your demons. Since I was a baby, stickiness has been a trigger for me, of the worst kind. If I got sticky AT ALL, I would freak out. If I couldn't get myself un-sticky within seconds, all societal conditioning went out the window. Screaming. Crying. Doing ANYTHING to get to clean water as soon as possible. This was up until I was about twelve. After that, I got a slightly better handle on it. I could mostly keep my cool, but people would be able to tell that something was wrong. I would sweat. My hands would shake. I would get tunnel vision. But I could behave like a civilized being until I got clean. 

Today, I realized that stickiness was effectively my god. If faced with long-term stickiness, I wasn't sure what I wouldn't trade for a bucket of water. Stickiness had the ability to *control* me. An inanimate texture was exerting absolute dominance over a human being. And that human being was me. That wasn't right. So, I did one of the hardest things that I have ever done(and I don't say that lightly. I jumped in front of a car to escape the voices in my head that were telling me to kill people. Yeah, I'm fucked up. But we all are, and that isn't what this is about, either. Though I am voices-free now). I went to the kitchen, I grabbed the maple syrup, and I poured it all over my hands. Then, I rubbed it in to my arms and face. I let it dry. Then, I stood there for twenty minutes. I touched counter tops, my chest, the floor. I clenched and unclenched my hands. I flexed my arms. I felt the sensation of sticky. I felt the irrational fear and discomfort well up beyond almost anything else I've ever experienced. It was indescribably hard for the first ten minutes. Then, it gradually got easier. Less uncomfortable. Then I was OK. I washed everything off and sat down at the computer. I feel beyond amazing now, and it's all because I stopped giving the biggest fuck that I have ever given.

I am free from the tyrant that was my god. Now, I doubt anyone else that ever reads this will have the same problem with stickiness that I had. I'm weird; I get it. But what is your god? What would you give up anything to avoid? What would you give anything to have? Whatever it is that you would give up anything else for, that's your god. Sometimes, it's worthy. If your highest priority is the betterment of humanity; I salute you. But make sure you know what your god is. Would you give up anything to avoid a room full of spiders? How about snakes? Is it heights? Is it talking to that cute girl in the corner at a party? Is it the fear of death? Don't let yourself be ruled by a god of fear. Go lock yourself in a room of spiders or snakes(preferably not poisonous ones). Go skydiving or bungee jumping. Talk to the goddamn girl. Stare death in the face. Spread maple syrup all over your body. Confront your fears. Come back and tell us how it has helped you not give a fuck. I feel absolutely amazing right now. Go feel what I feel right now. Go.

So you're tired, ""not in the mood"", etc.  Get control of yourself, take initiative in your moods and decisions.  Do what you can to control them.  Any experience is as much what we make of it as it is what actually happens.  Hope you guys have some fun with this week's task.

Personally I don't believe that it's always something you can learn.  For some people, the only thing that they need to do is stop giving a fuck.  

I don't know how else to explain it, but that's how it worked for me.  One day I got fed up with everything and instead of boiling over and exploding, I just said ""FUCK IT"".  I just got tired of caring and stressing about the dumb shit that everyone else was preoccupied with.  I just give it everything I got and if it's not good enough, then whatever I was attempting to achieve is no longer worth my time.

Funny, I didn't subscribe to this subreddit looking for advice, I subscribed because I saw a bunch of like-minded individuals that were able to more eloquently word exactly how I feel.  At the same time I feel like a bit of an outsider because I can't offer any advice other than ""stop giving a fuck"".

How do I stop giving a fuck about money?  Just stop giving a fuck.  How do I stop giving a fuck about my ex?  Just stop giving a fuck.  My classmates are constantly verbally berating me, why can't I stop giving a fuck?  Because... well I don't know, but you need to stop giving a fuck.

That's all the advice I can ever give, and if that's not enough for you then at least you're in the right place.

""How do i ngaf about break up, acne, what people think about me, etc.."". The key to not giving a fuck is simply[it can be simple] realizing the truth of your situation. Most people ask ""How do i not give a fuck?"" because they are trying to avoid the hard way which is ACCEPTING the situation that they are facing and taking the necessary steps to CHANGE this situation.


Most people are afraid or too lazy to change so they crave easier ways to change what they want that dont require hard work. Suppose, a person posts ""I think that I'm too fat, I'm too short, I'm not good with conversations, I'm too poor etc."", we know that this person is aware of his/her flaws. From here, this person must realize the truth of these situations. If you think you are too fat, then you must CHANGE this. How do you change this? Work Out! Most people are too lazy too work out so they post on howtonotgiveafuck hoping that there is no EASY way to stop giving a fuck that doesn't involve such hard work and commitment. This person must first, Accept that he/she is fat. Next they should make a decision, is this changeable? Yes. Do I want to put in the hard work to change this? And the people who answer no, are the ones who you will find posting on this reddit ""How do I not give a fuck?""

You have to realize that there are no shortcuts to achieving success in what you want. Instead of saying, how do I not give a fuck, think about what it is that you need to stop or start doing to change your outcomes in life and the way you react to these events. 

When you start doing this, you realize that you have the power in what happens in your life. A mantra that I have recently included into my life is ""Don't Choose Failure"". And by this I mean, when you are presented with situations in your life, don't choose the failing decision. EXample: If you are fat, you have the ability to change this by sucking it up and losing weight. If you say, ""But I dont want to work out"" well then you just chose failure. If you don't want to work out then your only other option is to choose to ACCEPT this since you don't want to change it. Now if you decide that you Don't want to work out and u also cannot accept the fact that you are fat, then you are the cause of your own suffering for choosing to not change it/or accept it.

We have to learn to be able to accept the truth in any situation. Stop looking for an easier way. Stop trying to pretend like you don't know what the truth is. We dread the fact that if we want to get girls then we have to Approach girls, but the truth is approaching girls is the only way you will get better at talking to girls. If you want something to happen you gotta make it happen. A person can tell you HOW HOW HOW All DAY! But YOU have to be the one to DO DO DO.

I also want to remind you that I am not the most perfect person in the world and I'm no better than any of you. But I believe that people need to realize and be aware of the brutal truth and stop trying to hide from it and look for easier ways. Everyday it gets easier and easier. I have learned by doing and am becoming closer to a true honey badger each day. 


I leave you all with a quote I came up with one day while sitting in my room smoking weed. I wrote it down. 
""If we fail, it is because we choose to fail. There is a difference between failing and falling short. Falling short is a result of trying a having no success. Failure is the absence of attempt.""
---This goes with everything I choose to do in life. If I choose not to do my homework, I choose to fail because I am the one who made the choice to not do homework. If I don't approach the girl that I think is sexy as fuck, I choose to fail because I physically made the decision of staying in one spot and not talking to her. Apply this concept to every part of your life and you will realize you are in control of all your decisions you make in life.

TL;DR BAsically: If you give a fuck about something, then something needs to be changed. Find out what needs to be changed and once its changed you won't give a fuck about it anymore. If you can't change it, or don't want to change it, you must accept it and therefore not give a fuck about it once you have completely accepted it.",Revelation,False,,t5_2tna8,1374361956.0,revelation,,True,t3_1ipybi,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/1ipybi/to_not_give_a_fuck_you_must_break_the_question/,

I'm at a loss for words. I've been strung along for God knows how long now, making excuses for my lying ex-bf (first ltr/hs sweetheart). I thought he'd one day notice just how I often I give him the benefit of the doubt; dismissing the red flags to see him as the most incredible man in my eyes.
 
FUCK ME SIDEWAYS. Sorry, I'm processing it. I just cut him off from ""sex-zone"" with me because I deserve more. She (my ""best friend"") seems to think it's just no big deal and wants to keep hanging out with me everyday like old chums. He actually told her to not tell me about their new agreement in lieu of my hurt feelings. I can't count how many times I've let him know honesty means the most to me... fuck. Whatever.

**ALRIGHT.** Now that yall are caught up, HNTGAF folk. Way I see it, people will expect someone to react a certain way. Obviously, you can tell above my brain is spinning a clusterfuck of a livid storm. I'm basically just giving you a snippet of what chaotic thoughts look like. However, I have jurisdiction (i.e. reign) of this mental domain. The part that matters, ladies and gents, is **How You React** to situations. Easily, and I mean emphasis on the Fucking EASILY, I could bitch-fit at both parties (which is expected). I won't do that though.

My life experience has already taught me the lesson of stepping back in emotionally compromised issues and taking a look at how I want my next decision to reflect who I am. It's not that I decide to not-give-a-fuck, but rather recognize the flaring emotion and decide it's not worth the anguish on my part, not to mention the regret later on how I chose to handle it. 

You can't control all the shit that hits the fan of your life, but you can dictate how you will let your emotions control your reactions. I know from experience, you'll grow as a human being for it and gain a much larger appreciation for the ""trials"" in life so to speak. Some of the best expansions of my character have come from hitting rock bottom. The shit gets easier to juggle on your plate if you keep practicing mental awareness before you act.

I don't know what I'm going to do yet, but so far I've gathered that forward is a good direction. I don't think ""friends"" who cause more heart-ache than support belong in my life either. Absolutely no idea how to tell them yet, but it was almost therapeutic typing all of this out to an incredible community of support.

This paradigm shift is freedom. Hakuna Matata, friends. 

Edit: If you want a shot at this ""paradigm shift"", but don't know how to get there, here's my secret. I participated, open-minded, in this weekend event called the [Landmark Forum](http://www.landmarkworldwide.com/the-landmark-forum). This ultimately shifted my outlook on life for the better.

I just learned the difference between true friends and selfish assholes.

Recently I've started looking for a job, even a stage, because even if I'm still studying for a degree I'd like to have a taste of how the real work is. A week ago I found a request for a *digital account junior* made by a company in the field of web marketing. I was thrilled and so I sent them an email to introduce myself alongside with my CV.

The answered within two fucking days to set a meeting.

Yesterday I had this meeting and turned out that and, tough they were really impressed by my email, they said I'm not fit to that specific role because of my peculiarities (I'm thoughtful and introspective), but since I write really well and they read something on my blog, in their opinion I could be a really good copywriter. I should follow my inclinations.

They are not looking for a copywriter right now, but now that I know my true potential, I know where to look.

In the past days I only told this stuff to a couple of friends (I'm a male and they are females) and I had full support. It was nice because they truly believe in me and I felt that! They shared my enthusiasm even after the ""failed"" interview, because it was my very first and I received words of encouragement. Of course, I should not give a fuck and be to first to believe in myself, but the point is that it's undeniably nice to have some sort of support, of trust.

Tonight I summarized all the events to my long time friends, while we were drinking a d chatting at the pub. They made fun of me, they pictured my interview like a complete failure where I acted the part of a useless fool.

I felt really bad, but suddenly I realized one thing: I had to leave these people behind me.

Guys, trust me on this: the people you hang out with **do matters** in delineating who you are! Surround yourself by positive, passionate and supportive people, because they will influence you, even if you try to avoid it!

A true friend is hundred percent honest when it comes to serious issues, even if it could hurt you, but is able to put himself in your shoes and be a true supporter because he/she cares about your happiness.

I started to feel my own happiness becoming dependent on her being happy with me and being around me. She eventually broke things off, and put said ""she just wants to be friends"" I was emotionally destroyed and way too much of my emotional well being was dependent upon her. I was giving way to much of a fuck about a girl, who really could give 2 less fucks about me. 

Then this weekend, I had a revelation. I saw her out at the bars and she initially tried to come up and spark conversation with me. She was being flirty and trying to keep my eye on her. I tried to not give a fuck, but deep down I wanted her back like old times. Then she got tipsy, and started flirting with other guys in front of my face just to get a reaction out of me(and she did). She put a damper on my entire night, and ruined it....and after a couple days of being alone I have realized
1. I do not need her to make me feel wanted
2. I am wanted and I will find those people
3. I do not need a girl to be happy

My ex cheated on me after several years of marriage and now, many months later, I've started seeing a girl.  This girl is awesome.  She's loving, caring, understanding and seems to really be into me but I cannot help but think every now and then that she will leave me/cheat on me.  For context she's 38 and I'm 40.

She tells me I have nothing to worry about and I've read as long as you keep your SO happy, you shouldn't fear but I still cannot help but have these images in my head of her cheating.

A secondary issue is I have a bit of retroactive jealousy.  I know it's irrational to be jealous of her past relationships but sometimes the images of her with other dudes pop into my head, uninvited.

I need help badgers.  I know this girl is not my ex and she doesn't seem to be the narcissistic, selfish bitch my ex was/is.

UPDATE:  I posted below about me finding some dude on her FB friends list whom she met on Plenty of Fish but never met in real life and how I didn't understand why she could still be friends with him when she is going out with me.  

Well, she came over a bit ago and I think I figured something out.  I told her I was seeing a girl a few months ago and it didn't work out so I de-friended her on FB, deleted all text messages from her, deleted her number, and blocked her on the dating site I met her on.  That's the way I deal with somebody whom I have no interest in anymore.  I just sort of expected that to be the norm and so by my fucked up reasoning, my gf shouldn't be FB friends with this dude if she has no interest in him at all, so she must have some interest in him to remain FB friends.

This is fucked logic.  Not everybody handles things the way I do and just because they don't doesn't make them wrong.  She basically said, she rarely uses FB and even though she knew she was friends with this dude, she didn't think it was a big deal because she never talks to him.

How do i ngaf when everyone asks me why i dropped out?,blahidkwhatimdoing,163,35,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/19bqdd/decided_to_drop_out_of_college_for_a_bit_to_deal/,"I'm a long time lurker and this is one of my first posts ever(this is a throwaway account though). Sorry for its length and if it's confusing or if i'm even posting in the right place.

For the better part of 6 1/2ish years i have been smoking weed just about 24/7. I remain functional and kidded myself about the way it affected me. I was so bad that even when i tried to take breaks from it, i became a borderline alcoholic. Going through a liter a whiskey or vodka every 2-4 days. I have been apathetic towards my school career. Never saw an adviser, just picked random classes i figured would help my major,  and have never put probably more that 70% of my effort into anything I've done for school. I really have no work ethic towards school work. I planned on trying to stop smoking for school and try to fix 5 years of ignoring everything about school but attending classes. 

Well i really tried to quit about 2 months ago but every time i got stressed i broke down. So i threw away all my smoking devices and realized i have no healthy way of dealing with stress. I break out in a sweat and my heart races and i feel very anxious whenever i even think about the stuff i needed to catch up on at school.

Now i have decided to withdraw from this semester because i wish to see a counselor, exercise, help my parents out(who both suffer from health problems), and work more. I don't feel i can make up for my 5 years of college where i made no connection with my department or professors in the state I'm in. I still really hope i am making the right decision by withdrawing.

Sorry for how long this is, but basically i am a very private person and i have never really had anyone to ever talk to and no one but my mom knows my situation , so it felt good to type all that out. 

Now i will be using my time more focused on myself and my family and now i am going to face the questions of why i dropped out from both family and friends after going to college for 5 1/2 years now. And if I'm not going to school why am i not spending more time having fun with my stoner friends (who are going to college or graduated and probably smoke as much or more than i did). How do i not give a fuck? I feel like everyone else can do it, but I feel so god damn overwhelmed by everything. Though my parents know everything and will support my decision, I still know they don't want me to drop out. They think I will not go back, when I feel more capable. 

This is a decision that I hope is right and but every time someone asks why I dropped out and I just say personal reasons it always makes me feel like a failure.
How do i not give a fuck and just help myself? Did withdrawing make me a loser? should i have toughed it out?

TL;DR;
I have trouble with stress and reality from being constantly high or drug for years. Now that I am trying to clean up i realize how reliant i was on such things and how badly I am affected by stress. I now wish better myself and learn how to healthily deal with stress and life. Now I am withdrawing from school after 5 1/2 years and will be asked by family and friends alike why I dropped out after so many years and why I am not partaking in partying with my friends. How do i not give a fuck and just do what i think is right for me? 


edit:Sorry everyone that i haven't gotten on in awhile. all this shit makes me paralyzed sometimes and I'm even frightened to sometimes read these responses. thanks to everyone for your responses though. 

Before i officially dropped out i went to talk to the dude incharge of it and he talked me into just dropping the two classes that i really neglected and doing very bad in and keep trucking through the other ones. He was insanely nice and i felt he genuinely wanted to help me. He help me set up a meeting with a counselor and everything. I even met with the counselor the next day who directed me to an off campus counseling service. She was helpful but i really felt that Dan, who was the guy who talked me out of dropping out wanted to help me more than she did. but regardless i am going to contact this place and see if maybe they can just help me find alternatives to just trying to avoid stress and reality.

Also i thank everyone for the support! ",,False,,t5_2tna8,1362366598.0,,,True,t3_19bqdd,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/19bqdd/decided_to_drop_out_of_college_for_a_bit_to_deal/,

If you truly didn't give a fuck, I assure you that you wouldn't be posting a story on here who's whole subtext seems to boil down to you desperately trying to convince yourself that you're perfectly happy with the fact that you accomplished nothing of value tonight outside of dancing badly and pretending not to care that people were staring.

Not giving a fuck means instead of forcing myself to go to a party I know I'm not going to enjoy, ostensibly under the guise of ""coming out of my shell"" which is just code for ""I desperately need the validation that other human beings provide and I'm desperate for any self-help-esque internet advice that can grant it to me""... instead I just stay home and play video games, because that's what I enjoy doing and large crowds frankly tire me out.

Does this seem pathetic? I think you're misunderstanding the point of NGAF. I get out of the house plenty, and I socialize plenty, but I play to my strengths instead of forcing myself into situations which are simply *not me*.

Stop trying to force yourself where you don't belong. You're not a party goer. You're not a frat boy or a jock. I don't understand what you're doing at a party surrounded by people who literally represent everything you are not, and probably shouldn't want to be.

You're a fucking nerd. A geek. You weight 250 pounds and payed 10 dollars for your glasses frames. Fucking OWN it. Meet people at D&amp;D night. You'll probably enjoy being around them a hell of a lot more. And the best part is, they'll probably enjoy being around you, because *they're your people*.

Stop thinking that if you just eliminate all the fuck-giving in your life that love will find you, and she'll be like apple pie and way out of your league. 

""Haha"" you say, ""there's no such thing as leagues if you're alpha enough"".

Bollocks. You weigh 250 pounds, are hairier than an ewok 4chan lurker, and somewhat resemble a cave troll from Lord of the Rings in facial characteristics.

And somebody, somewhere is going to find it completely fucking adorable, and endearing, and love you for it completely. But it won't be Scarlett Johansson. 

You can't go forcing something if it's just not right. And that's the biggest thing that I feel most subscribers to this subreddit miss. That NGAF doesn't mean trying to force people to like your personality with the bluntness of your presentation, but rather being completely comfortable with the fact that maybe less than 1% of the population is capable of understanding or appreciating you on any level, and that it's perfectly okay.

**Story:**


I'm a well-behaved pushover waiter who does more than the fair share of work. I pulled my manager aside and (calmly) told him some issues I have with my job. 

He decided to be a dick about it... but I don't back down. I NEVER talk back to him; this time was different. 

He tried to explain how I should ""deal with"" his shitty policies, and how lazily the place is run. When he realized he couldn't win, and was only fueling my indignation, he backed off until the shift was over.

My one regret: I wanted to quit and walk out. Instead the coward fires me after the shift ends, and makes sure there's another manager in the room.

**Moral:**


He made sure there was another manager in the room. He has always been smug around me, nonchalant, but not anymore. He fired me because he was *scared* of me.

I don't call off, I do extra work, I never snap. I'm a fucking trainer there. Textbook dangerous.

I've never been fired. I've never fucking gotten a write-up there.

But I told him he was wrong and I knew it, and he saw that I'm capable of standing up. Not trapped in a sorry fucking subservient role; I don't give a fuck. 

He was visibly freaking out because I was calmly sitting in the restaurant after our ""talk."" (Earlier, I offered to give someone a ride home and didn't want to bail on them)

I had a shitty night/morning, I feel great now. I've still got a part-time day job.

When fucks given are directed towards the behavior of others there is a lack of trust in regards to how they will affect me. For example my boss had me do a temporary fix for a major problem at work. He doesn't go down and check it out, and makes it seem like he doesn't give a fuck, which is partially true.  On the other hand he is putting that trust in me to get the job done, relieving himself of some stress as he takes care of the permanent solution.  Trusting people to do what they gotta do is another mode for not giving a fuck, and overall reduction of stress. A good thing to think about is what are they're doing, will it really affect me?  As it turns out most things really aren't that big of a deal, duh, that's the crux of this subreddit. 

Listening to everyone's advice. I don't look at who they are, only acknowledge the advice. I don't have to follow it or even agree with it. Absorb it, churn it around in my head. After awhile something useful will come out of it, it might not even have anything to do with the advice, just another realization. We're all on the same level, everyone's own experience elicits their own coded perspective, it's just the language that will throw you.

The world isn't black and white, nothing is absolute, don't throw 100% trust into everyone and everything, you already knew that!  Just listen to them, let them do their thing, and continue on your merry way of not giving a fuck. -Cheers.

When I suddenly moved away, my friend was shocked that our un-tearful goodbye was a mutual nod and a 'see ya'.  But it recently occurred to me that my 70-something year old Mother might have been more Honey Badger than me all the long.

In good time and in bad she was nonplussed. My siblings sometimes became angry, thinking she didn't sympathize with our deep and wounded feelings. She's chock-a-block full of trite truisms and 'old Irish' sayings. She would patiently listen to each and every diatribe. But no matter how much we wailed, she would frequently respond- ""No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.""  

Which did nothing but infuriate us!

In good times and in bad she was always level.  I drop out of university....I smash up my car the first day I get my license...I get dumped by my girlfriend... 

""No doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.""

Well today I took a good hit to where the honey badgers don't live.  ...that place where you thought you had armor but you didn't know was actually just dangling in the wind? Blindsided.

Anyway...it occurs to me. However if feels, however it might turn out or could have been- The universe IS no doubt unfolding as it SHOULD!

For the rest of this gem of wisdom seek out Desiderata by Max Ehrmann.

Here's a taste:

"" But do not distress yourself with dark imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness. Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should. ""

Peace.

See, every day we're supposed to come to class prepared to talk about a pre-assigned prompt for 3 or so minutes, with notes on a 3x5 index card and everything. The professor pulls names out of a hat, and there are about 3 or 4 people who speak in a given day. Usually, I don't do great with public speaking- even though I have my notes, I usually lose my place or just trail off because I don't do great in front of audiences. 

So today, of all days, I walk into class and realize that I'd completely blown off making the index card. I sit down, back of the class, and start praying that it's not my name drawn today. Please not me, please not me, anyone but-
""ERRYDAYIMSTRUGGLING?"" 

Shit.

I stand up, move to the front of the room, draw in a deep breath, and turn to face the class- 

And deep down, way deep down inside me, the little cash register that holds all my fucks goes NO SALE. I opened my mouth, told a little joke about being unprepared, and don't really recall the rest of what I said (I hadn't even read the prompt for that day before class). 
At the end of my speech, my prof told me that she wished she had a video camera because my presentation was perfect. She also said, ""We're going to stop right there for the day, so as to end on a high note."" 

All those little motivational posts and your other success stories and everything that is this subreddit has helped me today.

But if you're looking for some laughs and an example of a character who truly lived what it means to ""not give a fuck"", look no further than Patrice O'Neal. 

Patrice O'Neal died a year and a half ago, and the video I'm linking to is the radio show Opie and Anthony did right after he died. It's full of people phoning in and remembering Patrice by telling stories, and it really describes a man who reached an unparalleled level of honey badger. 

This isn't a quick one-line quote about not giving a fuck. This isn't a lesson that can be copy and pasted onto a facebook status. But if you take the time to learn about this guy, you'll understand what it really means to ngaf about social expectations. 

FULL VIDEO: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiQMIczzPpY

For those who want quick soundbites and not a long video, I've time-stamped some of my favourite stories about Patrice from the full video:

 [Does a comedy set where nobody is listening, so he starts trashing everyone on stage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=jiQMIczzPpY#t=553s) (2 minutes)

[Patrice versus a loud girl in a bar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=jiQMIczzPpY#t=2272s) (2 minutes)


If this has interested you, here's a short video in which Patrice describes his philosophy to life. 
[Patrice O'Neal: ""I'm Trying To Be Righteous"" ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1svdF4ONcXY) (4 minutes)

I'm just going to spew a bunch of honey badger shit because I feel like it. I'm kind of baked, it's Sunday, football is on, I'm wearing a robe, and I've never really been good at putting heavy, important shit into awesomely concise and witty sentences, so sorry if this isn't the most articulate post, but I got some shit to say. Go Niners. 

When I discovered this sub-reddit, it felt like a way-station along this yellow-brick road I'd been stumbling along. The one where you finally realize where you're actually going. All the stuff I'd been kind of ""figuring out"" throughout life is here, plus a lot more. But you don't just become a honey badger over-night. You can't just read this sub, and bam, you're Eastwood in Fistful of Dollars. I've trying to badger for a long time, it isn't easy. If you're still a teenager and you're reading this: Sorry bro, you're still fucked for at least a few more years. A few more glorious fucking years. I know I didn't want to hear this when I was a teenager, but you aren't you yet. You're going to change a lot, accept it. Don't be afraid to suffer, it's going to happen anyway and there isn't a goddamn thing you can do about it. This. Is. Your. Life. You only get one viewpoint, and there is only one thing that matters; how you experience this life. There was a time when I was on the verge of eviction, without power, a job and had one very pissed-off girlfriend, and I was actually happy. Why? Because there was a giant heap of trouble, and it was up to your Boy Wonder himself to handle that shit. And he did. It sucked balls, but it was satisfying to know I could get through it. There is some odd satisfaction is doing things you don't want to do, but know that you have to. And after you do that a couple dozen times, you just stop giving a fuck about petty things. You are going to lose friends. People are going to die. You might end up really hungry and really cold. It's war out here kids. Five years from now things will be completely different, there isn't a goddamn thing you can do about it except find a way to enjoy the ride, even the scary parts. Round yourself out: Find some sort of spirituality, be kind to people even if they're shitty to you, find some cool people to learn from. Focus on growing whenever and wherever you can, don't be ashamed of how you feel, do what you feel is right. And don't ever forget that somebody out there right now thinks you're really fucking cool, and even though all relationships change over time there will always be people out there who think you're really fucking cool, because you're here, actively trying to be who you want to be.

1342173192.0,115,self.howtonotgiveafuck,whqpz,One of my NGAF role models: Marcus Aurelius,,124,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/whqpz/one_of_my_ngaf_role_models_marcus_aurelius/,"Over the past year I've been reading a lot about Stoicism which has helped me immensely in my quest to become a Honey Badger. The Stoics were all about maximizing happiness and minimizing negative feelings with the ultimate goal of attaining a state of tranquility. My favorite Stoic philosopher was the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius and I thought I'd share some of his thoughts from his writings called '''Meditations''. It's a really great read which is my go-to book for guidance about NGAF and I think there's a lot of stuff in there which this subreddit would love.

**Responding to negative feelings like fear, worry, sadness, embarassment and dealing with failure and rejection:**

“If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.”

“Here is a rule to remember in future, when anything tempts you to feel bitter: not ""This is misfortune,"" but ""To bear this worthily is good fortune.”

“Unhappy am I because this has happened to me.- Not so, but happy am I, though this has happened to me, because I continue free from pain, neither crushed by the present nor fearing the future.” 

“You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength"".

“Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.” 

“If you are pained by external things, it is not they that disturb you, but your own judgement of them. And it is in your power to wipe out that judgement now.” 

The main idea is that while you have no power over certain events which may occur in your life you have complete power over how you respond to them. Feeling sorry for yourself or feeling sad is a choice. Instead choose to be a Honey Badger and continue on like nothing happened and take pride in how you handle adverse situations.

**Not caring about other people:**

“Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness – all of them due to the offenders’ ignorance of what is good or evil. But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility, the nature of evil and its meanness, and also the nature of the culprit himself, who is my brother (not in the physical sense, but as a fellow creature similarly endowed with reason and a share of the divine); therefore none of those things can injure me, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading. Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together, like a man’s two hands, feet or eyelids, or the upper and lower rows of his teeth. To obstruct each other is against Nature’s law – and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction.”

""If someone can prove me wrong and show me my mistake in any thought or action, I shall gladly change. I seek the truth, which never harmed anyone: the harm is to persist in one's own self-deception and ignorance""

“Or is it your reputation that's bothering you? But look at how soon we're all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of those applauding hands. The people who praise us; how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region it takes place. The whole earth a point in space - and most of it uninhabited.”

There are so many other great insights in *Meditations* these are just my favorites. I recommend picking up a copy of the book . Also check out [r/Stoicism](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/). And remember Honey Badgers:

""Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking""

The windows were such that your blinds either were entirely open or else they shut out all light. So, I would just leave them open, and when I got up in the morning, I'd stand and stretch in the nude occasionally glancing up at the crowd of 20-30 people maybe 20 feet away in the bus shelter. The older men would look away, the older women would gawk wide-eyed, the young men would laugh and point, and the young women would giggle and turn bright red. I'm not an exhibitionist, but if my choice is between keeping my blinds down and shutting out all natural light or doing nude yoga (really, is there any other kind of yoga worth doing?) in front of 30 people, there's simply no question. Sometimes, when my fuck-not-giving was at its highest, I would make eye contact with someone staring and give then a convivial head nod or wave. 




It made me realize that sometimes, when you're told something is supposed to be embarrassing (like being seen naked by crowds of old women) it helps to ask, ""Why?"" Why should I give a fuck if people I don't know and probably will never see again see my warrior-posing asscrack? The only thing that will happen is that I'll lose all semblance of awkwardness about nudity and that a bunch of people will have brilliant stories to tell about that crazy birthday suit honey badger.


**EDIT:**

For all ya'll Badgers who are worried over whether I ought to be prosecuted for doing yoga and those who are so thoughtfully concerned that I may in fact be a crazy exhibitionist sex fiend who enjoys flashing old women, I'd like to reassure you that your worries are without substance. However you may have pictured this story happening, I was not purposefully standing next to a window letting me man-parts swing to and fro. There is a window, and one can see into my room from the street, but it's not an unavoidably obvious view; a vast majority of people at the busstop never notice that I'm there. 


The point of the story as I already mentioned in comments is not to brag about flashing people, but rather to emphasize that being seen naked by other people doesn't have to be a mortifying possibility. I'm not saying we ought to parade ourselves (honestly, no one would care to see all of that) I'm merely saying that we shouldn't feel the need to triple check our window blinds and huddle in the corner in gymroom showers. With regards to human bodies, less fucks ought to be given.

I took a deep breath and decided to go talk to her. I walked toward her, trying to keep my cool, but inside I could feel the anxiety spiking. In my head I repeated over and over, ""Don't give a fuck. Don't give a fuck."" But every step made me more nervous. The doubts began to creep in. ""What if she's busy?"" ""What if she has a boyfriend?"" ""What if she gets creeped out?"" ""What will everyone else around me think?"" I got within a few feet of her, made eye contact, then just smiled and walked past.

Relief soon gave way to self-loathing. I had chickened out, given a fuck where none was needed, and now the opportunity was lost (like so many before it). I started to beat up on myself, my internal monologue turning to harsh self-criticism and disgust. I was about to enter a terminal fuck-giving spiral.

But instead I just took a deep breath. I said to myself, ""It's ok. I gave a fuck. I did. But that's ok. I recognize it, I'll learn from it, and I'll grow. But there's no reason to be so hard on myself. I'm a man who gives so few fucks, that even when I give a fuck, *I don't give a fuck.*""

A strange, almost Buddhist wave of calm washed over me in that moment. I could feel the fucks simply float away from me, disappearing into the ether. A minute later I saw a girl who was an absolute stunner. Someone that a guy like me had no business talking to. I smiled, for I knew that it was impossible for me to give a fuck about what she or anyone else thought of me at that moment, and I strolled right up to her. Ten minutes later I had her phone number.

That's how social scientist Brené Brown defines shame. While I was watching her [TED talk videos](http://www.ted.com/speakers/brene_brown.html), I thought that her findings go to the core of what this subreddit is about. Shame, vulnerability and self-esteem.

Watch them. They are humorous and very inspiring:

* [The power of vulnerability](http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability.html) (TED talk 1)
* [Listening to shame](http://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_listening_to_shame.html) (TED talk 2)
* [The difference between guilt, shame, humiliation and embarrassment](http://vimeo.com/4620966) (extra)

**Not giving a fuck is not about** having no emotional response to the things that happen to us. We're human beings, emotions and empathy is what we are all about. It took me a long time to realize that. Brown explains it perfectly.

**Not giving a fuck *is* about** boldly being vulnerable. Not trying to control, but to accept. It's about realizing that you're not perfect, but worthy of being loved. You shouldn't let other people judge you, and feel ashamed about yourself because you are imperfect. 

Note that shame is not the same thing as guilt, humiliation or embarrassment. Shame is more fundamental. There are almost no situations in which you deserve to be ashamed. 
&gt;Brown: ***""Guilt means 'I made a mistake', shame means 'I am a mistake'. You can't apologize for shame. We feel like we deserve it.""*** 

It's not easy to show vulnerability, because it means being courageous. You have to accept that getting disappointed or hurt is a possibility. But you should *never* be ashamed about who you are. 
&gt;Brown: ***“Vulnerability is not weakness. And that myth is profoundly dangerous. Vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage.”***

If I thought bad thoughts about myself, then of course everyone else is going to say them too. It turns out that the things I said to myself in private were probably the most important things that I ever said. They influenced my entire view on life.

Every day when you wake up, look at yourself in the mirror. Really look at yourself. Take a sticky note and write one compliment about yourself. A genuine true compliment. I don't care who you are, you can find one thing that you love about yourself. Put that on a sticky note and stick that to your mirror. It doesn't have to be anything big, it can be something small. My hair looks fantastic today. I love the way that shirt looks on you. Great job waking up today.

What I've basically realized is that I have no hope of getting into a prestigious university (not trying to put down the Canadian Universities I've applied to but American Uni's are much more prestigious). My dad just told me that he knew I probably wasn't gonna make any of them due to the 'lack of effort I put in'.

TLDR; read the title.

EDIT: for anyone that is curious, the three universities are Johns Hopkins, University of Michigan, and Case Western Reserve University.

(THIS WILL BE CONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS.)

If you have read my previous [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/19gmrh/a_post_for_fellow_niceguys/), I am sure that you were either helped or pissed off by it.  If you were irritated, I apologize.  If you were helped, I am grateful.  I will be talking asexually so that both genders reading this will feel serviced; my previous post was directed more toward men.

First thing is first.  I love people with a dark past.  I don't know why.  I  have a very dark past, and I suppose that I find comfort in associating myself/getting close to others with a dark past like mine.  This, of course, comes with some risk, and I will lay them out for you by telling you my experience.  I dated a girl named Erin.  She was the grunge-type girl with tattoos, several piercings, and a goth-type appearance.  We were eye to eye on nearly everything.  She had a very dark past, as do I, but we were very different to a third party.  I dress up.  I am always in a polo if not a dress shirt, always in nice jeans, and you can usually find me in a nice trench-coat during the winter months.  She would dress in leggings, baggy tops, and other things that looked more for comfort than for style.  Among other things like smoking and drugs (which I do not do) we were, honestly, very different people.  However, I felt that she understood me, and I was so, so desperate to be understood and accepted that I completely blew-off everything that I disliked about her for the one attribute I so-craved.  This is not good, ladies and gentlemen.  Our relationship ended because of her emotional state, as you can read in my [resume](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/18gtig/selfpreservation_through_selfdestruction/).  It taught me a lot, which is what I want to relay to you.  If someone that you want to date or become more romantic with has a dark past (like or unlike yourself), that person must have accepted the situation and moved on from it.  Erin had many things in her past that she had not moved on from, and it is ultimately what ended our relationship.  I realize, now, that I did the best I could, I treated her with the most respect and love I could muster, but things in her past were keeping her from being able to do the same for me, so she ended it, resulting in my recently suppressed depression.  I have tried to kill myself twice in my life, neither time were because of Erin.  I no longer think deeply about it, and I have moved on from it.  That is what makes me able to truly put my whole heart into a relationship.  If I, even for a second, thought that I wasn't good enough for the person I was dating, I would fall into a depressed cycle that would tear us apart in the end.  I urge you that you find out as much about the person you want to date as possible so you don't make the same mistake that I did, which is date someone with a dark past that still clouds his/her present life.  Also, do not get into a relationship if things in your past bother you.  It is okay to have a dark past, but don't let it run how you live your life today.  You need to realize that it is in the past, and tomorrow, you will be the sun to brighten your own day.

Next, you must realize that you are not the answer.  You aren't.  You cannot say anything that will help someone long term, nor be a beacon of light for someone's stormy life.  You can help people, yes, but they must help themselves.  It goes back to feeding a man a fish: if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.  If you teach a man to fish, he can feed himself for a lifetime.  The truth is, is that someone in emotional distress **MUST** be able to find a way to cope or bring about internal happiness.  You will be nothing more than a drug.  A temporary high that they will crave and become fixated upon.  This is not healthy for you, nor the recipient of your kindness.  You must not be their crutch, but you may help them fashion their own support.  Tell them what they want to hear, then tell them what they need to hear.  In that order.  After that, you must let them know that they need to seek their own ways about the world in order to be truly happy.

Now, if you are depressed, I know exactly what you are thinking.  No matter how true you think your thoughts are, they aren't.

* I'm not good enough for anyone.
* Nobody cares about me.
* I'm a loser.
* I should die.
* Life would be so much better if I didn't have to live it.
* I want to drive into oncoming traffic with my hands against the roof of my car.
* I wish someone would start a fight with me, just so I could let them beat the shit out of me.
* I am going to get my gun and blow my head off.
* I don't want help because everyone will think I'm a failure.
* I am a failure.
* I have done nothing in my life to help others.
* Nobody would miss me if I died right now.

But I run my own business and naturally there's a lot of new challenges that arise. I'm a technical guy but for business purposes I've been working hard on improving my sales skills as well as public speaking. So I decided to take a Level 0 class in Improv comedy. And I have to say, that in just 4 weeks, it helped me so much.

Anyone with social anxiety problems or who makes up millions of 'what-if' scenarios of failure before doing anything, I'd highly recommend taking a beginner's class in Improv comedy. More than comedy, it emphasized on many aspects of communication such as 

* **Saying ""Yes""**. This is the whole basis of Improv. Saying yes not only pushes you out of your comfort zone but also is an important tool in supporting your scene partner in taking the scene ahead. Removes any negative vibes. It's been the most fun I've ever had. I found myself playing silly games where the 'corporate' me wouldn't have even bothered. I went back to some of the Project Mayhem tasks here and tried the high 5 one again. And this time with more confidence and positive body language at a crowded, snobbish Chelsea intersection in Manhattan. And damn, did it feel fucking good. At the end of the last class, I even did an Open Jam. 
* **Listening closely** to your scene partner. In improv there's no script so you have to take cues from your partner's lines, emotions, body language, props/object work, etc. to take the scene further. This is the best part because you'll automatically block out any distractions and focus on the key areas of non-verbal communication. Few people in my class even told me that they're introverts and making eye-contact was something a little difficult for them.
* **Just letting go**. The premise of so many of the scenes were so silly but there were no fucks to give. No judgement at all and fuck cares if anyone even judges me. Doing something out of your comfort zone takes some balls (especially when you're sober as fuck). You tell that little judgemental sonofabitch in your head to shut the fuck up. 

I'm definitely taking more advanced classes after this. And for you my friends out there, I suggest looking up for a class in your neighborhood or meetup group.

Keep in mind that have a straight-male bias, though. If you give any of these fucks, stop it.

**I give a fuck whether people think I'm attractive.**

Most people don't find you attractive, no matter how conventionally attractive you think you are. Why would you give a fuck about what most people think? You won't be fucking the majority of people if you got laid twice a day with different people every day for the rest of your life. You sure as hell won't be in a relationship with the majority of people, or even friends with the majority of people. 

**I give a fuck if I'm rejected.**

Why the fuck would you care if someone realizes they're not for you and saves your time by rejecting themselves? Let's say they didn't. Now you're stuck with shitty sex or a relationship with someone who doesn't like you. Are you a fucking idiot?

**I give a fuck that I'm friendzoned.**

Oh shit, they're not attracted to you but they still like you. Your life is fucking terrible. Once you're done crying about it, ask them if they have some single friends. Chances are, they have friends that are like them, but doable. What's wrong with that?

**I give a fuck that I'm in a dry-spell/get laid rarely/am a virgin.**

If you're that concerned about it, go fuck prostitute. If you're concerned about safety, go to legal brothel. For us Americans, you can take a trip to Nevada. For Europeans, Amsterdam is overrated, go to Athens and go fucking crazy. The point is you could be fucking at any time, you just choose not to. You always have options, act like it. If you know this, you don't get desperate. Honey badgers are sexy, as we all know.

**I give a fuck that I can't get laid (or well-laid) when I want to.**



[Absolutely no one can](http://www.thefrisky.com/photos/10-celebs-that-allegedly-got-caught-with-prostitutes/hooker-dangelo-jpg/). If you think there is a person who can have satisfactory sex whenever they want, you are abso-fucking-lutely gullible. There is no magic skill that you can learn that lets you have quality sex consistently. This is like giving a fuck that you aren't a genie that can grant wishes. Why?

**I give a fuck that everything is so fake and formulaic.**

You know what you're supposed to do, so stop fucking doing it. It will make a lot of people uncomfortable, and these are people who suck (see above). The best thing on the planet is when a honey badger finds another honey badger. I once had a girl topless on her back in my bed when she asked, ""Do you watch Hellsing? It's an anime."" Killed the mood, launched a cool conversation, had mind-blowing sex afterward.

**I give a fuck that my sex sucks.**

Girls get embarassed if they queef after doggy-style or if they fuck up their birth-control and get some blood on someone. Guys get nervous about their performance and it causes them to ejaculate prematurely, or they sweat all over the place, or they go soft because the condom was too thick. There are times when you're getting crushed and you have to ask your partner to fucking move. Things like this just happen. Don't give a fuck about them, and fuck someone who neither gives a fuck. Real sex is not all stoic and dignified, or whatever the hell else our popular mythology says it should be. When two people are completely comfortable with themselves and each other, sex is awesome. You can do some research into how-to-sex, but everyone is different and the first time will never be the best time you have sex with that person. Have fun experimenting. Don't be afraid of asking for what you want, and don't judge your partner if they do. If someone says no, it probably won't ruin anything (bdsm and certain fantasies should be discussed beforehand, of course).  Also, if you have to convince someone to have sex with you, or fuck them when they're in a state that they can't say no but would otherwise, at (rare) best the sex will be terrible, at (most likely) worst it will be rape.

**I give a fuck that I haven't found love.**

Stop fucking looking for it. It's not something that you can conciously develop. It's a force that comes out of nowhere and fundamentally fucks with your life. It doesn't make sense, it's not logical, and it's not something that you can conciously create. It's not particularly common, though. It's like a creeper from minecraft: you don't have to look for it, it finds you and fucks your plans up. Knowing this, why fucking worry about it? Just do what you love, and then love pops in. If it never does, you were doing what you love your whole life.

**I give a fuck that I lost my love.**

Ok, serious shit here. It's not possible to NGAF about losing your love. If you've never been in love, you might be incredulous. If you have, you know what I'm talking about. It's a force of nature that can and will destroy you. The best you can do is damage control. If you think that going into a year long depression is some weakness that you should hide, stop giving a fuck. People who have been through it will understand. Break down, there are few pains worse. Don't let it eat you alive from the inside. Be honest about it, and find out that your close friends have been through the same thing. I was embarassed that my life was (temporarily) wrecked by someone I was in love with for two days, and my subsequent chasing her around the country and world for a year because I would not get it that she didn't return my feelings. Now I don't give a fuck. I did that, and I'm not as unpenetrable as I thought I was. I live with it and it's made life a lot easier. I frowned and got blurry-eyed typing that out and I'm not afraid to let anyone know.

Hopefully I've stripped away some of the fucks that you might have left. As usual, just do what the fuck makes you happy.

Quick story: I discovered weed senior year of high school. Parents knew, gave a fuck, but I was able to hide it from them very well and continue kicking ass in school, I had 2 jobs, etc. In other words, weed helped me come out of my shell, have something to be passionate about, and taught me to not give a fuck.

Then after I graduated I moved out to live on my own, I found other much harder drugs and fell in love. At the same time, found a girl and fell in love. When my dependence spiralled me into depression, I ended up losing my house, job, girl, ... and it wasn't anything's/body's fault, other than mine, because I somehow had unlearned all my fuck restraints. But then in the midst of it all, I find this subreddit.

I'm starting to realize that I'm not experiencing life for myself most of the time and I live and breathe for the social acceptance of friends...and even strangers.

I've been told many different times and in many different situations how witty, awesome, and hilarious I can be.  I love making people laugh so much that I thrive on it.  If you are having fun - then I am having fun.  Simple as that.  However, there are times where I am completely enveloped in this cloud of self doubt and anxiety - destroying my social ability to communicate.  Even with friends I've known for years.  This feeling, this...mental state makes me feel so insecure and uncomfortable in my very own skin.  I start to stumble over words and trying to say something relevant to the conversation becomes impossible.  The words I speak feel ""false"" as they leave my lips.  It's a combination of what I say and how I say it....and I'm sorry that I can't express the emotion in a different way.  I all around feel like a shitty socially awkward human being when I am experiencing this mental state.

This event triggers occasionally - around every two weeks or so.  I start to dwell things.  I start to question myself about things that I rationally know are true.  Suddenly, I don't feel like myself and I start to feel like I'm not as entertaining as my friends say I am.  Then, I start to worry that I am going to disappoint people because how great I was yesterday isn't the same as I was today.  

Maybe I'm so concerned about how others feel about me all the time that my self doubts become a reality?  A self fulfilling prophecy where if I think I'm a certain way then I become it? Maybe I just need to not give a fuck so much about entertaining other people and just be comfortable for myself?

The days where my mind is clear of all insecurities and I am focused on other things...those are the days I really shine.  To myself and especially to my friends.  Those are the days that slaughtercow feels like slaughtercow.  I would like to have more of those days.

I'm 24. I work at Starbucks (I.E. I don't make much money). I am pretty average looking - on my best day, maybe a 7.5/10. In other words, I am just like most of you. 

Last summer, I began making a conscious effort to lower the amount of fucks I give on a day to day basis. I started by quitting two different jobs on the spot (which I highly recommend trying). I began exercising, and I got in shape. I started caring less about what girls thought of me; I figured: they’re either going to like me or not - either way, it's not my fault. With this perspective I grew confident, and I slept with three different girls, got a  B.J. from another, and made out with probably a dozen at bars. Girl-wise, it was a good summer. But most importantly, I found out, for myself, exactly what it is I want to do with my life.

Okay, so anyway, a more tangible story: this weekend a great buddy of mine and I went out in the city,from bar to bar meeting people, and doing our thing. I should let you know, that I had like $2.50 on me, and that’s it. I was pretty much flat broke. In the past this would have crippled me. I’d have had stupid thoughts, like, *“fuck I can't even buy her a beer, oh shit, woah is me, I’m a loser wah wah wah.”* Now, I try and improve my attitude about circumstances like this, and use it to my advantage.

We start the night getting into a rhythm: walking along the streets, saying high to people, talking shortly with a few girls, and trying to take it all in.

The first bar we settle on has a smoking hot bartender. 8/10, easy. 

I opened a conversation with her, saying, ""Hey, we need a pretty drummer. Be in my band."" 

She smiled and asked me about what kind of band I'm in. I shot the shit with her, and told her about my fake band, and how we don't play our instruments, we just stand on stage looking pretty. We had a few laughs, and cracked some jokes back and forth. It was a very fine conversation. Finally, I spent my only money on a PBR, and she left to help her other customers.

After I finished my beer, she approached and asked me if I’d like another. I told her  that I did, but that I was flat broke. I had a Powerbar in my pocket and I pulled it out and told her I'd trade her it for a beer. I had no expectations that it would work, I was only trying to keep up the fun, comical, rapport we had built. To my surprise she loved it. She laughed, and grabbed me a beer (of course, she didn't take the Powerbar). 

So I drank my beer, and her, my buddy and I chatted about music and bar life. She again left to help out some other patrons, and my buddy told me he's going to ask for her number. Him and I had a short conversation that went somewhat like this:

""Oh yeah? You're gonna get her number?"" I asked  him.

""Yeah, what should I say?"" 

""If you need a line, you're dead in the water. I'll do it."" 

I waved at the bartender, and she came over, and I looked her in the eye, and simply asked her, ""Can I have your phone number?"" She gave me a bit of suspecting look, and asked me why I wanted it.

""To call you."" I said, without changing my expression, pace, or tone of voice.

I didn't call her, I texted her, yesterday, four days after. She didn't respond. I fucked up. Oh well, I can always go back and try again, or get more numbers. There's always more people to meet.

Something I always tell myself is, “if you’re going to say something, say it straight.” This has come from analyzing a lot of writing, and deciding that the best way to convey information is to simply say things as simply as you know how. Don’t think about what you’re going to say, think about what you are hoping to convey. The words will come on their own if you’re being honest enough. 

Of course, I don't act this way all the time, and I slip up and begin, again, to give more fucks than I'd like, but it's not about being perfect. It's about improving your life and being a happier, more positive individual. Nothing good ever comes without effort, but once it comes, it doesn't ever fully get away. Remember to keep your head up, and never slip into the dangerous thought that any situation will last forever, good or bad.

But that's where I work and go to school, so most people I know live there. However, even when I'm already in the city and someone says ""hey I'm getting sandwiches want to come?"" I just think ""ugh, I'm so ready to go home... I don't want to...""

I've been dabbling into the philosophy of ""not giving a fuck"" for some time now, observing how I reacted to situations that would elicit givings of fucks and how much of a drain it was on my being.

**I literally could not stop thinking about how I apparently didn't give any fucks.**

And that made me wonder. ""Do I really not give a fuck, or am I just trying to persuade myself?"" I thought. Well, undoubtedly, I was trying to persuade myself on certain matters that I did not give a fuck when I actually did. This type of thinking requires further pondering, and more attention directed towards breaking it down and moving on.

If you can resolve a problem in your mind by stating that you do not give a fuck and *you attentively notice the negativity dissipating within your mind,* then well done! You certainly don't give a fuck.

**However,** if what you claim to not give a fuck about keeps coming back to the forefront of your mind, time to reconsider your stance and resolve it through other means that may or may not eventually lead to truly giving no fucks about the matter.

Since our community is comprised mostly of high school and college students, you all should have some free time this summer. Thus, the summer reading list.

Last year, I offered up an opportunity for people to share their favorite books that really signify the /r/HowToNotGiveAFuck philosophy. Now it's time to do it again. This year, however, I'd like each of you that chooses a book to write up a brief post about the book and the knowledge you gleaned from it. As a show of solidarity, I'll be doing one as well.

The post that I feel demonstrates the most growth and revelation will receive 1 month of Reddit Gold from me.

A link to this post will be placed in the wiki, along with the the full completed list.

It was a fine affair, everyone got quite liquored up and was having a ball. Towards the end of the night, after the ceremony, meal, speeches, came the dance. It started off high-energy, exciting, and all that. I was very tired, and also being a bitch, so I didn't really join in often. Clearly, I was giving one too many fucks.

Later on, the dance started to die down, as everyone became more intoxicated, more tired or more homeward bound. It came to the point when there was not a single person on the dance floor of this mighty hall, but still a lot of fine-dressed people sitting around it, joking and talking. It's as if no one wanted to go in and start the next dance. And then the song changed. Rasputin by Boney M. blasted to the high heavens. And that was his call.

Out of the blue, this man leapt, seemingly out of nowhere, onto the dance floor. He appeared to be over 60, wearing a tuxedo suit and jeans, and holding a martini glass absolutely filled to the brim. He bopped around, by himself, in front of the eyes of every last guest there. And once the chorus kicked in he performed the most glorious Russian squat dances I've ever seen. It appeared in human, how low he got. Once the song was over, he abruptly stopped dancing and walked out of the hall. Not a drop of drink on the floor.

I didn't learn the extent of his badassery until after all this happened. With everyone's jaws dropped, I asked my date, ""Who was that?"". She had no idea. Her mother had no idea. The groom had no idea. This random man walked in off the street, grabbed a free drink and squat-danced his way into the not-giving-a-fuck-history books. Random drunk, I salute you.

Let’s define “giving a fuck” (GAF) as an uncontrolled emotional response to external stimulus that is a function of both time and brain power (energy). A common example: you get rejected by a girl and you feel like shit, you have no control over your emotional response to this negative stimulus and you feel like shit, aka you GAF. Turn it around though - same girl walks up to you and professes her desire for you. You have no more control over how good that feels than how shitty the opposite case makes you feel. I would argue that you GAF about her feelings towards you both good and bad.

The value of giving a fuck:
Let’s define all instances of GAF (numbered 1,2,...,n) to hold a value -1&lt;=Fn&lt;=1, such that all Fn&lt;0 are negative instances of GAF, all Fn&gt;0 are positive instances of GAF and Fn=0 implies you do not GAF.

Theorem: You are limited in your ability to GAF.
For proof, assume the opposite. You can give unlimited fucks about unlimited things. Above we defined GAF as taking up both time and brain power. Since neither of these properties are unlimited, then our ability to GAF is therefore limited. If you actually gave infinite fucks you would literally be spending every second and every bit of energy to GAF, and would be unable to perform basic human functions.

Let’s express this by saying the sum of the absolute value (positive distance from zero) of all instances of GAF (F1,F2,...,Fn) for an individual is such that 0&lt;=SUM&lt;=1. At 1 you GAF about a lot of stuff, and at 0 you have reached not giving a fuck. Your positive GAF (+GAF) does not cancel out your negative GAF (-GAF). You can GAF about + and - stimuli at the same time, but you are still limited in the total amount you can GAF. 

Define the vector (Smile,Frown) such that Smile=the sum of all +GAF and Frown=the sum of all -GAF.

Define %Smile to the the portion of SUM which is derived from +GAF and %Frown to be the portion derived from -GAF.

What do we mean when we say “to not give a fuck”? The corner cases for (Smile,Frown):

(0,0): In this case we truly do not give a fuck about anything, good or bad

(1,0): Nirvana. In this case we don’t GAF about the bad stuff that happens, but really care about the good

(0,-1): Your life sucks. You have no ability to enjoy anything and you are defined by the bad shit that happens in your life. If this is you, it is amazing that you have not killed yourself.

If we take the title “How to not give a fuck” in the most literal way, then we are saying that the true goal in life is (0,0). Before we accept that as the ultimate goal, let’s apply a basic utility function such that: Utility=Smile+Frown
The solution that gives us the maximum value for Utility is (1,0). 

Put all of this together and look at the greater implication.
What if your goal in life was not to forget about the bad shit, but was to enjoy the good? You want to maximize %Smile which will necessarily drive %Frown as close to 0 as possible. 

If you truly do not want to give a fuck about all the shit in your life, then start caring about all the reasons you have to enjoy life. Focus on your friends, family, SO, hobbies, work, school and start giving a fuck about all of them. Give your fucks freely and generously, but make sure they are good fucks and that they are directed at the things and people worthy of them. Don’t waste your fucks on the bullshit that life throws at you. The more time and energy you waste fucking around in the corner wondering why you got rejected, then the less you will GAF about all those great things you have in your life. 

Many of the posts here seem to ask the same question ""How do I stop giving a fuck about....?"" It struck me that we have a very negatively defined view on the world if the only focus is to try to NGAF about stuff that seems to bother us. It seemed silly and ridiculous to me to narrowly define the world in such a way. Don't get me wrong, I have been equally guilty of this, but it got me thinking while I was on my run. Try to turn the question around and ask yourself ""what should I be giving a fuck about that I currently am not?"" 

If you really want to learn how to not give a fuck, then start by actually giving a fuck about the right things in life.

I'd never really gave a fuck in the first place, but this Summer I specifically told myself that I would not give a single fuck. Here's my story:

1. Asked a girl out shortly after school ended, to which she said no. I haven't spoken to her since.
2. Some would call me smarter than the average bear, so I'm in a fancy AP English class. Anyway, we had to write a ten-page essay about The Scarlet Letter over the summer. School starts tomorrow, and I know people who haven't started that shit yet, but sure as hell have time to bitch about it via text and facebook. Me? I finished that shit two and a half months ago. Oh yeah, I deleted my facebook and twitter accounts this summer as well.

3. I spent my last full week of Summer watching all of the James Bond movies, The Godfather Trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, The Bourne movies, and Saving Private Ryan because I needed some Tom Hanks in there too.

4. My friends went to The Dark Knight Rises midnight premiere without telling me, I said fuck it, and went by myself, ended up running into them at the theater, and sat by myself with my legs propped up on the (empty) chair in front of me the whole movie.

5. My parents asked me if I was gay. I let the question hang in the air.

6. I wore plaid with stripes.

7. Went to a skatepark without knowing how to skateboard. Alone.

Decide what you think the most appropriate method is.

Think of something you regret.  It can be small, large, or in between.  If it is small but still bugs you at night, consider repeating it with friends and/or strangers until you realize its insignificance.  If it is big, apologize for it.  This may involve apologizing to yourself.  Don't forget to treat yourself the way you believe others should be treated.  Use discretion with this one.

I read from a book recently that I felt very appropriately described four words.  The words: regret, fear, anxiety, and guilt.  Guilt was described as a form of self torture; an inappropriate use of regret.  Anxiety was similarly described as an inappropriate use of fear.  Fear and regret can be used in very positive ways.  They are tools to help us be better people.  Taken to an unhealthy level, they become forms of self torture that are not in any way fair treatment of ourselves.

Around 2am and ending up at a bar of a night of NGAF. Went salsa dancing, clubbing and met a bunch of interesting and beautiful people.

We separated from that group of locals.  I was getting tired and since I'm in this part of the world often, it was easy to justify to myself calling it a night. Having a drink while my friend was doing a lap, I was not very invested in the moment or making anymore connections, I stared off, reminiscing how this bar reminded me of bar from college with an equally over the top 80's cover band. I was ready to let the rest of the night in HK go to waste.

I must have projected my not wanting to be there any longer because a lone HoneyBadger came to me. A quick greeting and he was direct to his point: ""Look around my man, you can have whatever you want. Go get it"". And with that he was off again.

I gave myself a second to appreciate the random encounter. Ended up spending the entire night out with lovely company, leaving a club with the sun in my face and almost missing my flight.

1367309129.0,91,self.howtonotgiveafuck,1dee8e,"I just found HNTGAF, and I would like to share something you might appreciate",argon-donkey,109,18,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/1dee8e/i_just_found_hntgaf_and_i_would_like_to_share/,"I just wanted to use this to set out my philosophy on life, and maybe help someone gain an insight into their own situation.

Firstly, I'm 18. I know, not exactly a wise old statesman. I live in the UK with both my parents, and my dog Tom. I'm just finishing the last year of A-levels (the year before university). I'm mad crazy about birds, and biology in general. I love metal.

My life is going pretty good, all told. I'm off to Oxford University to study Biology next year, and I've got good friends and a loving family.

But I used to suffer from depression. For about 3 years my life felt like a ship's anchor that had come loose in a stormy night, and had come to rest in some dark and murky place in the crushing ocean bottom. I suppose this came from a range of things:

* Being generally more intelligent than other people. This cut me off from a lot of 'acceptable' interactions and...
* ...meant that I had very different interests and aspirations from other people. I love birds. I mean, really really love them. People ridiculed me for that, which was annoying
* Personal relations have always been difficult. I'm a friendly guy, but I can be a challenge to be around. Not because I'm nasty, or obnoxious, but because I found it hard to fully relax

So this carried on until December last year. Which is when I realised that not giving a fuck is singularly the most freeing philosophy. 

It was at the interviews for Oxford and I met a girl who was also applying for Biology. We got talking and we really hit it off. It was like we had known each other far, far longer than less than a day. But the crucial thing was is that I'd never had any kind of relationship. This was because I had never been myself with people, because I was so concerned about people judging me. But I forsook that in December. I was myself with her. And she said herself that she loved that, that people are very rarely genuine, or honest, or open. 

I realise that I found that happiness because I stopped giving a fuck. I stopped holding myself back. I let my own self come to the fore. There is so much said about dancing, laughing, singing, and that is because that is what it feels like to not care, to be free. The girl I met was a mirror in which I saw my reflection and danced with it.

Since then, I have realised the value of setting yourself loose of insecurity, or anxiety, or self-doubt. My mum (a very wise woman) said herself the other day ""You know you're greatest strength? You just don't give a shit about what people think"". And I thought, yeah, maybe it is.

Now, if you'll permit me, I'd like to share a few things I've learned, and would recommend to others:

* Laugh. At anything you feel like. Find humour and joy in everything you encounter. Laugh at yourself. 
* Be honest. I'm not talking about simply ""don't tell lies"". Being honest is about opening your heart to and for people. Denying what you feel, or keeping it back, is like finding an orchid in the wood and then taking it home to keep in a drawer. Show people what you are, and what you think. There is so much restriction, so much repression of feeling that, if you let them free, you become someone people admire.
* Do stuff you think you won't like. This has been great. It comes in with a spontaneity thing, but essentially just do things and meet people that make you uncomfortable. There's nothing worse than the safe zone. If you don't like, who gives a shit, just don't do it again. But if you do...well, there's something else entirely
* Read. You're not so alone
* Write. Putting down thoughts, feelings, wonderings or worries lets you place them in front of you like a dissection, and realise that it's really manageable. I've found even writing fiction is enjoyable. It doesn't have to be any good, just that it's your's.
* For God's sake go outside. Not just to the shop, or to school, or work, but just go out. Nature is one thing in which the day-to-day problems of being fade away, and make you mindful of the living world around you. An hour's walk is like meditation.
* Care about stuff that matters, and forget stuff that doesn't. I mean, worry about some things, because a lot of things genuinely matter, because they go beyond yourself. But with things that directly, individually concern you - don't worry. Whatever happens, you will be happy, because you don't mind the outcome.

Anyway, I'd like to close with a line of poetry from T.S. Eliot's ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"":

*And would it have been worth it, after all,*

*After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,*

*Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,*

*Would it have been worth while,*

*To have bitten off the matter with a smile,*

*To have squeezed the universe into a ball*

*To roll it toward some overwhelming question*

Yes, it is worth while

I’ve recently started to take notice of the energy I waste entertaining the opinions of people I really have no business giving a fuck about, at times even letting their thoughts of me make me look at myself with less worth. And then I came to this conclusion:

Every time I tell myself that I need to prove something to a person or a group of people, I’m putting myself in debt to them. I then owe them a validating action. Whatever dissatisfying image I’m afraid of exuding will needlessly weigh on my mind until I go out of my way to show these people either what I want them to see, or what they want to see from me, it doesn’t matter. In either case, I’m letting the desire to portray an image to people who will likely not have any effect on my future influence my current actions or thoughts. Sometimes at a great cost to me and my time. Before I allow anyone’s opinion of me determine my actions or affect my mental state I need to just take a step back and ask myself, is it really worth giving a fuck?

Longer Version: You are going to die, but you're brain likes to think like what you are doing has permanence to it.  We are able to convince ourselves that we are going to live forever when we make our decisions.  Often we would be much more suited to have a Fight Club style scene of a gun to our head, and be forced to make the decision that actually matters once we remove the nonsense that dilutes our ability to figure out that which truly matters to us.

The scariest part about our brain is the lengths it goes to in protecting itself from losing things.  When your brain goes into a mode of protection, it focuses on what mistakes can be made, and the Fucks come out in bulk.  But when you stay focused on seeing opportunity, instead of protection from loss, then you start to give a lot less fucks.  So how do we stay away from going into protection/prevention mode?

This brings us right back to realizing the fact that we will die, and even further, that everything and everyone we know and love is going to be taken away from us at some point, or at the very least we will lose it all when we die.  Every friendship, every job, every random attractive person we see in the street - at some point we will lose our relationship with that person/thing.  There is no permanence to any of it, and yet our brain wants to make decisions like there is.  Recognize the truth, and you will start to see that giving a fuck is actually something reserved for your decisions for yourself and what is truly important to you.  I hope this finds you in good health and that you found use in it!  If not, well, (cheesy joke alert), *I don't give a fuck*.

It feels great to be able to ask questions without feeling embarrassed. It feels fuckin' amazing to be able to dance, as ridiculous as possible with no fear of judgement from anyone else at the club. It feels awesome to be able to tell someone to fuck off, when they are trying to pressure you into doing something you don't wish to do. It helped me realize that I should have more fun with myself, and stop taking life so damn serious. This class, combined with exercise and healthy diet has made me a happier person, and that happiness has radiated onto my family. I use to be really introverted, and even had trouble conversing with my family, but now it just comes much more naturally. It's increased my relationship with them and hence has made us all happier.

Another area of my life that theatre class has helped me in, is in my ability to **focus**. Once you memorize the lines, a big aspect of becoming your character is by focusing on your character's intentions. You learn to block out the audience, pay attention to your character's intentions and just focus on what you are doing.

Not to mention, you might end up taking a strong liking for acting. I'm switching majors from Psychology to Theatre, worst comes to worst I become a Theatre teacher and/or Life Coach. I know it It's helped me deal with criticism, and it's also a great emotional outlet.

**CONFIDENCE.** You won't believe how many of your problems stem from lack of confidence. I use to always double think myself before I did something, and now I just go out and do it.

**Perspective**

Everything about this philosophy is centered on perspective; how your mind sees and interprets life. If you aren't happy with your current perspective, you can change it. That is our goal in this subreddit. Coming together as people who truly want change for ourselves; to be happy. 

That being said, I do not imply that this change is always easy. For some, it will be the hardest thing he or she has ever had to do. I am one of those people. But with challenge and hardship, comes victory.

**More Overview**

Think of this logically. Attachment causes care. Attachment causes desire and dependence. The idea of attachment is the opposite of what not giving a fuck is about. The very idea implies that if you lost that thing you are attached to, it would be the end of you. That is not good. Bad. No bueno. No matter what, you should be the backbone. No person, thing, or idea should represent your happiness. You represent your happiness. Your perception and mindset represent your happiness.

**Taking Yourself Too Seriously**

This idea is revelational and it will make losing the fucks you do not want in your life so much easier. Want to know how to toss your care to the side on cue? Lose yourself. Let go of the mindset that you are center of everything, because quite frankly, you are not. With the loss of ego and not taking yourself too seriously comes freedom. Freedom from fear and all the other irrational emotions that you find yourself feeling that inhibit your ability to do the things that you truly want. With the power to just say **FUCK IT** you can do anything. **Fuck** what that person will think. **Fuck** my reputation. **Fuck** expectations. **Fuck** doubt. All this unproductive over thinking is just illogical bullshit that is holding you back. Be a badass  and just do it.",,False,,t5_2tna8,False,,,True,t3_11321u,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/11321u/how_to_not_take_yourself_too_seriously/,

Infinite sadness. Maybe you're ugly. Maybe you're socially inept. Maybe you have a legitimate condition. It doesn't matter. Here is why you feel that way and how to not give a fuck about it. (Note: I am a straight male, so I will speak from my perspective, but these concepts should work for all gender/orientation perspectives.) 

The perception: You don't have a girlfriend and never will. Everyone else seems to have all the happiness and love. You have nothing and will die repulsive and alone. 

The actual problem: You want two things, but you're combining them into one. Here are the two things you want.

* 1) You want female companionship. 
* 2) You want sex. 

These are both normal human pursuits. The fallacy is you're looking for both at once.

**Solution to #1: Companionship**

Deliberately friendzone a girl. 

You might not have a lot of friends. You might have friends but they're all guys. You are thinking of girls as (Compantionship + Sex) only. That's fine and normal, but as an enlightened honey badger you need to take a step back and realize that's not the only purpose of girls. Realize you're measuring one half of the human population for only one purpose. 

Consider you find yourself in a conversation with a girl. You've got three or four things in common but she's seeing someone. **HONEY BADGER MODE: ENGAGE. Friendzone her immediately.**

Suddenly, you've got an ally. You know that other gender you can't seem to connect with? You've got someone to talk to about that. An insider. An informant. A spy. 

PRO TIP: DO NOT USE THIS AS A CHANCE TO COMPLAIN. The allure of this instinct is strong. Do not fall for it. **No human wants to hear another human complain.** You have a friend, don't dump all your problems on her. In fact, why don't you take a second to listen to her problems? Maybe you've got some insight that can help her out. It'll make you both feel better. 

PRO TIP: DON'T FREAK OUT ABOUT BEING FRIENDZONED. This does not mean you are repulsive, it just means that particular person is not particularly into you. Being friendzoned is not an insult. Maybe she's got some insight into why it won't work. Just chill. Give zero fucks. Realize an other-gender friend is a fucking powerful ally. If you become good friends, there's a pretty damn good chance she'll help you find a better hookup than she'd be. 

Your new ally is likely have social circles of her own. She will likely have great ideas for stuff to get you out of the house and around new people. Some of these people will likely be girls. Once you realize you're being social around girls, you'll start to feel like there's lots of fish in the sea, and suddenly there's not so much pressure on getting it EXACTLY RIGHT with the *one girl* you met at that at that *one place* that *one time*. The pressure is going to drop drastically, and you will be giving far, far fewer fucks. 

**Solution to #2: Sex**

Now that you're giving fewer fucks about limiting yourself to that one idealized *perfect happily-ever-after true love forever* relationship, you'll find this is a much easier problem to tackle. One or both of the following options will satiate your short term needs quite well until your newfound social live leads to a good relationship: 

* 1) Fuck some bitch you don't care about. 
* 2) Fap.

This is indisputable. For example: you breathe air for yourself and move for yourself. You eat for yourself and think for yourself. You have feelings that represent who you are. The list goes on. You are a person and you do things that people do, plain and simple. Everything in your personal life is actually centred directly around you.

Even if you have self-esteem issues, this is not in any way pep talk - this is literally fact. You’re the sun amongst the field of tiny stars. You are the leader of your own subconscious. Let that sink in. Now, put your own importance in your personal life against the existence and importance of the world itself. In relation to the world, you are nothing but a mere number, right? The world is a particularly huge place and you are a relatively small person, right?? Your existence is counted as a digit and potentially nothing more. The world basically dwarfs you. Isn’t it fascinating how you can be simultaneously the most important and least important thing in absolute existence?

But what if it didn't need to be like that? You are worth as much as you tell yourself you are. If you compare yourself to the world, you will feel like nothing. You will appear as nothing. You will be treated as nothing. You will be, in fact, a number. But if you compare yourself to your past, how you have grown, your accomplishments and all of your achieved goals, you will show to be very great. You’ll show to be inspirational. You’ll show to be a very important person. So what should you do? Set your own personal goals and achieve them in good time.

Ever since I started doing incremental things to change my life and personality into who I wanted to be (dressing nicer, cultivating confidence, being friendly, displaying genuine empathy) I've felt good about myself and people have gradually come to treat me like I feel. I get reverence from my closest friends who I once looked up to, new experiences and difficult social situations no longer worry me (and in fact excite me) and I feel like anyone who criticizes me is below me and worthy of pity. The addition of this subreddits mindset and some added philosophical mindfulness have really made me at peace with who I am (there's no one in the world I would change lives with). 

Recently this pretty cute girl got hired at the place I work. She's kinda the quirky type; short dark hair, cute pixie face, plays video games, likes internet memes and is always really pleasant to everyone. I've always dated more conventional girls so something about her struck me and I decided that she would be an awesome person to come home to at the end of the day. It's a pretty big place with lots of employees so we maybe chatted 5-10 times while she served me food or we had the same break. We never got into any real meaningful conversation or anything and so I set up a bunch of plans in order to show how interesting my life is and how fun I can be (I tend to think of myself as an average looking dude so I don't wheel on looks usually). So about a full week passes where neither of us work the same shift which is pretty unusual and I'm getting a little more motivated to close next time I see her. Eventually I look on the employee sheet and she's working later in the day so I decide that now is the time. I head on break and she's working at the food area so I head up to her cash and start some small-talk with the intention of leading the conversation to my business and eventually maybe hanging out. I ask her about her day and am ready to reply and run my game when all of a sudden she stops and says ""You know, we should really hang out some time."" I was pretty blown away. I say that sounds good and she asks if it's alright to give me her number :) It's pretty rare for a girl in my league to ask me out or be so forward without even knowing one another; let alone one I was already very interested in. It feels good to have all the hard work pay off, I remember even a month ago being frustrated that I didn't yet have the girlfriend I always wanted.

Disagreement != anger or overreaction.  This is an internet forum where we can discuss a certain topic.  Just because someone discusses something extensively, or goes out of their way to provide a thorough response does not mean they're missing the point of the sub.

In real life, NGAF might mean that you walk away from or avoid arguments that seem hopeless.  But the whole point of this sub is to discuss it.  People will disagree on certain points.  It's inevitable.  But we're all working together here to achieve a better understanding of what our goal is.

So I asked a girl out a few days ago, and I'm supposed to go out in a bit and I'm getting nervous.  I have pretty bad Social Anxiety, so doing something like meeting new people is really freaky.  And I know I'll go and everything, but I'm kind of afraid I'm going to clam up and get nervous in front of her.  Usually when I get nervous it comes across as displeased or unhappy, so I'm afraid if I get too nervous I'll act like a buzzkill even if I'm having fun.

I'm trying to tell myself to do whatever I want and just enjoy the night, but then my irrational anxiety kicks in and it doesn't seem to matter what mindset I have (or my older, deeper colors shine through).

Anyway I could use some help.  If y'all don't mind putting some of the things you tell yourself when you get last-minute nerves, I would appreciate it.  I might end up saying them all by the time the night is over.  Also I'm kind of not very seasoned at this whole dating thing so if you have any last-minute dating protips I'll take them.  I already called a guy I know who bartends at this one place with a cover so we can both get in for free. :-)

Edit:  We're going out again Friday. I didn't take her home, but we did kiss a lot and I think she liked it.  I would say although I was very Honey Badger-ish for myself I kind of got interested in talking to her *too* much and forgot to keep giving her signs I'm interested (something else I'm learning to do).",Help Me?,False,,t5_2tna8,1361727670.0,help,,True,t3_1949ns,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/1949ns/so_a_couple_of_days_ago_i_posted_about_how_i_got/,

1357230307.0,85,self.howtonotgiveafuck,15w6is,I posted this 4 months ago. It has to come my attention that it needs to be refreshed. Please read it.,BassNector,103,18,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/15w6is/i_posted_this_4_months_ago_it_has_to_come_my/,"Okay, I have some questions for all of you aspiring HBs or HBs or struggling HBs: 

Is everything you are doing in life worth it to you?

You have one shot, one arrow to split the one before you. One horseshoe to make a ringer. Are you doing your best? Are you enjoying life? Do you wake up genuinely happy or do you wake up to the grind? Do you spend the day happy or apathetic? Do you feel complete? 

If you answere those with all the grindy/apathetic answers then consider this. 

You have exactly today to live life. Not yesterday, not tomorrow. Today. And only today. Will you look at this and say, yeah, I had a great day at work! And can you answer that question every day of your life? Probably not. That's just life. 

But, do what you want. Constructive of course. YOLO. You Only Live Once. Think about. You may think it stupid or immature but it's true. Always be constructive. Don't go partying every weekend of your life with drugs and alcohol. Go skydiving. Go skiing with your childhood friend. Thank your parents for getting it on and birthing you. Go make yourself a better human exactly today. Not tomorrow and not yesterday but exactly right now. Right this fucking second when you read this whole post. There is only so much time and that time is gone now. Make it the best time of your life. 

Don't beat yourself up over not getting a promotion or getting that F. That money you COULD'VE gotten you probably didn't need. That F? You learned more than getting an A. Maybe you don't have a girlfriend. Use that time that you can focus on yourself, focusing on yourself. Better yourself. Go running or life weights. Maybe make out a better diet plan. I don't know. It's your life, live it your way. Don't let Mr. Bossman tell you around. 

It's your life, go live it right now. Also:

Are those dirty thoughts you think about Slutty Sally at work or Fat Joey st school really worth it? Maybe Slutty Sally has confidence problems and needs reassurance. Maybe Fat Joe has no friends an eats his problems away, befriend him. Befriend Sally. Always help those you can and don't judge them. Ever. The fact that you think yourself above another means you aren't. Everyone is pink on the inside. ""All worm food in the end."" think about that. Think about this whole post. Then act right now. 

I hope this helped some of you or opened your eyes. 

Have a good day and I hope life gets you to the top. And by that, not giving a fuck! :D

My ex wife came in yesterday to pick up my kids (8 and 3 year old boys) and told me she was going to introduce her boyfriend of 6 weeks to them.  

Most professional therapist's opinion regarding this issue is, from my reading, suggest this should not occur for 6 months at a minimum.  I relayed this information to my ex and she basically said fuck off-she did what she feels comfortable with.

Some context here on her decision making abilities - she cheated on me with a neighbor in our home with our boys in the house.  She also banged her cousin.  

So later in the day, I was driving down the road and by chance, I get behind my old mini-van, with her, my boys and some dude driving it.  Lucky me.

There's nothing I can do basically but I'm so frustrated that she constantly makes shitty decisions and bucks professional opinion when it comes to my kids.

There's no legal avenue I have nor is she rational enough to communicate with....so I'm basically fucked.

However, I'm a good guy, and would sacrifice my fleshy existence to make other people happy, because I have always gotten a bit of joy from helping others.


For those of you that don't know, living a live of self sacrifice isn't a shit ton of fun, and it certainly didn't help my depression.

  It all started happening when I began dating this guy and his circle of friends were all artists.  Now, I was pretty confident about drawing at the time, but I couldn't help to get pissed off by the fact that I was busting my ass at a shitty job (on top of school) while their parents helped pay for their rent and they got to have the whole ""magical"" college experience.  Plus a lot of them got seriously cool jobs afterwards too and it just made me more upset.

I began to start judging myself based on *their* work and *their* accomplishments for a long time (a year or two maybe?).  My life became a hamster wheel of trying to catch up and I would always doubt myself. If they went to conventions, should I? Should I do this? Should I do that? 

And then I found this dude: http://youtu.be/dwJZKEDMxPo

He didn't give a flying fuck about drawing batman fighting dinosaurs, or that he had to use shitty computer paper to draw on, he just did the damn thing.  And he even did it in a place that wasn't even appropriate, **he just really didnt give a shit**.

All he wanted to do is make things that *he* likes.

And that's when it hit me, I said to myself: fuck it
Who am I to try and prove that I am more ""successful"" and ""accomplished"" than these people? Like why am I even fucking doing that? It's stupid, I'm being stupid. Who cares.

Here goes.

I've always had self esteem issues. I'm a pretty outgoing guy, and I'm quite sociable, and I have an extensive circle of friends (which include a fair share of girls) that I respect and personally maintain a level of respect that I'm happy with. This is just me setting the scene: I seem like a normal guy, and I'm very happy for that. 

But I have never been able to get anywhere with anyone of the opposite sex. I honestly have no idea what is wrong with me; it's been like this ever since middle school and now that I'm partway through college still holding onto my v-card, it makes me wonder: Why? What am I doing wrong? Why do I seem like the least desirable person in the world? It's not even sex that matters. It's the fact that I haven't noticed a single time that a girl has ever shown any sort of interest in me (which I was reminded by when that AskReddit thread about girls giving hints came up). I don't think I've ever been flirted with, or checked out. I've never been asked to cuddle, show affection, and whenever I try to say something affectionate it either gets brushed off as a joke, the girl pauses and says ""oookayyyy"" or instantly distances herself away from me. Hell girls hardly ever text me unless it's for casual shit or they need something. 

And here's the elephant in the room:

I have a 4 inch penis. 3.5 inches in fact when I'm standing up because I'm a bit chubby above the crotch area, because I'm kind of built, but not extensively rotund in any direction. I've known that I wasn't going to be the standard size when I was 14-15, still rocking only 3 inches. I used to be a swimmer, so slip ups would often occur and I was constantly reminded how small my penis was. Even when my friends make small penis jokes at me or about people, I always laugh it off like I'm one of them. I don't feel normal. It scares me that one day I'm (hopefully) going to end up with someone I like, and I'll be too scared to take off my pants. People are always like ""oh no, size doesn't matter"" but it's still a mental stigma that I have a whole lot of trouble getting over. I feel like this holds me back at parties and such when I try to go and talk to girls. 

I know this thread seems stupid and I might seem like I have THE most trivial problems in the world, but these are things I haven't been able to get out of my head lately. These are the things I need to learn how to not give a fuck about. I feel like if I can get over these things, I can stop wasting brain power brooding over these minute problems. 

If my friends recognize me, please don't approach me about this. This isn't something I want you to pity me about nor do I want to discuss this with you.

Today something compelled me to run after work. I knew it was going to be dark when I got back home but it was just eating at me to get my shoes on and head out. This is what happened:

While driving, about a mile away from home, there was a large Dodge van on the opposite side of the road with its flashers on. I didn’t think much of it since there was a car parked behind it. I got home, played with the dog for a bit, got ready to run and headed out. I usually run on the same street that I take on my way back from work and, to my surprise the van was still on the side of the road. This is about 20 to 30 minutes after I drove by it! Now, I know this is suburbia and not many people are out and about on foot, so I was not very surprised that no one had walked by and helped. However, this was during rush hour, a lot of cars were driving by. Even more, the van was on the farthest right lane, which doesn’t have a shoulder. All cars were simply going around it. I stopped and asked the gentleman, about mid 50s, if he needed a hand. He said he needed to push it to the gas station about a block away. So that’s what we did. As we started, I noticed that the van was half full inside, not an easy load to push. We did this for about a half block and he had to take a break. My quads were also starting to burn. After a minute or so we started pushing again when we were about 30 yards from the station a guy drove up with his mid 80s Honda Hatchback and offered to push the van. Unfortunately the bumpers of the vehicles didn’t reach each other so he parked and helped push. As we started to go onto the driveway of the gas station two other people, a college student age kid, and an older Hispanic gentleman came over and helped out. For a few minutes, there were four people helping out this single man who had found himself alone with a bit of car trouble. Finally, we parked it, the man with the van thanked us and we all went our separate ways.

For the rest of my run I keep thinking about this. Seeing everyone help out was great. We all have it in us. We need to learn how to reach out to those than need it even when they don't ask for it. We need to learn how to be good to one another. At least 20 minutes passed while the man was on the side of the road. How much longer would he have been there if I had decided to watch a movie or play video games with my roommate? I don’t know. Maybe until the guy with the car stopped by. But maybe not. Maybe it was seeing someone helping out that gave him the push to stop and give us a hand as well. Maybe sometimes we need to see someone doing the right thing for us to join them. “Someone else will help” is not the right attitude, but it happens often. So please, help someone out. Do it for them. Do it because it’s the right thing to do. If you don’t, maybe no one else will; but if you do, others will join you. There is so much we can do for one another. From the smallest little gestures to the biggest generosities, it all helps. Love is all we have, so share it with everyone because we all need it.

I just discovered this subreddit and it's hilariously in tune with my life mantra at the moment. I read the Why post, the How post, and took a look at the project mayhem.


Everything on that list is something I have done or regularly do (namely, talking to strangers is my thing. I fucking make friends with everyone)

I just wanted to share some inspiration on not giving a fuck though. I felt myself being overcome by giving a fuck when I met a girl who gives literally no fucks lately. We hit it off, have been seeing eachother somewhat and our common interest is we give no fucks. Every weekend we try something new, that could possibly kill us, but I've literally had the best last 10 weekends of my life. When I realized she meant something more to me than I did to her, I felt the giving of fucks building up in my life. I've worked a year to stop and I honestly am so much happier for doing it, but here it was creeping back up again. 

How did I stop giving a fuck? I sat down and said optimal trajectory. Everything is happening for a reason and this is a sign. Something needs to change. I decided overnight that I would quit my job, move 8 hours away to the largest city in my country, move in with whoever the fuck i can find there, and start new. Not only did said girl end up moving to that city 1 month later for completely unrelated reasons, I've met so many new people who keep my life interesting and keep me from giving so many fucks about girl. I've started a new job I love in a completely different field than my training.


I have returned to giving no fucks by making a split over night decision, and my quality of life has been amplified 10 fold because of it.

Unfortunately, every. single. club. decided to become 21 and up.
As a result, we did everything in our power to not cause trouble for the establishment, as it were.

So me and my 3 geeky white-as-snow friends decided to try one last sketchy place before calling it a night[.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV_3Dpw-BRY) We payed the cover charge and walked into [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=me7xmErVSYg#t=55s) [0:55 - 0:59]. We walked to a table, feeling totally out of place, and sat down to watch lasers and disco ball lights hitting a completely empty dancefloor. There were one or two people bobbing to the music at their tables, but there was certainly nobody walking the dinosaur.
I suggested to my goofy, overly confident friend that we should go out to the dancefloor and act a fool. Being one to never turn down a challenge, he complied, but begged me to let him hide his face under his hood. I told him that was bitch-mode, and he eventually obliged. After working up his courage for a few minutes, he said fuck it and we got up.

Walking out there felt like walking to the guillotine, but once I got out there, something **amazing** happened. [This post described it best](http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/x21ye/one_of_the_most_profound_concepts_in_psychology/): I finally truly understood how to NGAF, and all feeling of caring what people thought about me vanished. I started acting a fool; clapping my hands, doing [The Carlton] (http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lt4djiyO7k1qbymhco1_r4_250.gif), and doing a little dance me and my friend worked on earlier that night for the gay club.

A few seconds into it, the DJ is giving us shout-outs over the speakers (he hadn't even talked in the 20 mins+ we were there beforehand and now he was talking like the party was just starting), and I can hear people cheering, laughing, and having a good time with the entertainment. My other 2 friends that stood by and gave a fuck were laughing their asses off and signalling us to head out as we swaggered off the dance floor.

As we were walking out of the club, one of my old co-workers we hadn't seen there caught up to us, tears in his eyes from laughing so hard, and asked ""What the hell, (*wipes tears from eyes*), were you guys doing out there!?"" and invites me and my dance partner to sit with all of the people he was there with and made introductions with us, the 2 party-starters. As we walked to his table, we noticed there were actually people out there dancing now (I guess we inspired people to also NGAF).

Overall, this whole experience felt like a huge stepping stone on my quest to always not giving a fuck. If life were a video game, I felt like I used a Gameshark to cheat my character up about 10 levels in that skill. I implore everybody to live life like they have cheats enabled.

A 'fuck' is just a thought accumulated in your mind, half of the time we don't even notice it but our mind is deciding how many 'fucks' to give for situations you find yourself in.  

Not giving a 'fuck' and giving a 'fuck' is literally back to back, with the thinnest of lines separating them. The decision you go with directly affects weather you walk up to that girl you've always wanted to ask out, speak up to that person that's always put you down or even moving on from something you cant let go.

But why do we give 'fucks' why do we force 'fucks' upon ourselves making everything more difficult in our day to day life?

A 'fuck' is the insecurity of the mind, it determines your next move. The more 'fucks' you give now, is the more your going to give later. 

The day you stop giving 'fucks' is the day you start to enjoy life, and learn more about who you are. You will immediately take of the pressure and overworking of your mind away, as it will be able to make decisions freely and 'fuckless'. Give 0 'fucks' and you will have 0 things to worry about. Stop being the worried one, always stressed,flicking through pointless scenarios in your head, which i promise will never happen, and just say 'fuck' it and do it.

From the title, I am having a huge anxiety breakdown. I am a 24yo guy still on the slow gravy train that is university, and I have been single for more than 5 years give or take.

I've recently run into a nice girl, she works at a hobby store I like to hang around at. I already took a big not give a fuck attitude and introduced myself and etc, turns out we're exactly the same, similar interests and hobbies, we've gone out together casually several times, and I can tell there is definitely something there.

My biggest problem is that I recently found out she's 17, making her at least 7 years younger than me. All sorts of thoughts are popping in my head, like am I a perv? The legal ramifications, and just the huge gap in age.

I like her a lot and I really would kick myself if I missed out on her, but I feel like I've hit a brick wall made entirely of anxiety.

Wat do?

EDIT: wow guys. When I post anything it usually just gets a few spotty responses and then gets down voted to oblivion by bots.

I appreciate the words of everyone that contributed tonight, I was in a dark place tbh, my mind was racing on how to solve this now rather trivial  seeming problem. I have found some peace finally and I know how I will personally act on this situation.

I appreciate the opinions of everyone on the situation, those who are against and for, you all provided great insight and personal advice/stories, I am very thankful for the huge amount of  answers I received.

I'm not sure when but be sure I will post an update and what I decided when it eventually happens, as someone said earlier (I can't remember which one posted a lot of you said it!), I need to stop thinking so much, slow down and just act when I feel ready too.

Anyway I'll admit it doesn't relate to not giving a fuck in the sense you'd think.  Well it does, but in the opposite way conventional logic would tell you.  But the secret is to actually just go ahead and give a fuck about everything you genuinely do care about.  Go ahead, seriously.  Ironically enough total honesty with yourself and others is what will liberate you from caring about most things, even if it means you initially care about things you don't want to.  If that's the case and you find yourself caring about something totally lame, go ahead and be honest and say, ""Hey I care about this.""  It sounds counterproductive but the more important aspect of early-phase HTNGaF is *not* actually pretending to not give a fuck but being honest with yourself and others and speaking up when you want something.  Then after a while when you start to feel comfortable with standing up for what you believe in and gain confidence.  And when you gain confidence in yourself, you begin to see that a lot of what you wanted wasn't a specific outcome but just to have things done your way/get attention/be heard/etc.  And **that's** when you see your inner Honey Badger come out.

The author explains it better than I do so I'll shut up now.  Anyway, I'd reccomend it to most anyone, especially those people who feel recurring feelings of powerlessness, weakness, an obligation to ""nice"" behavior, not putting your own needs first, etc.  Just read the first few pages and if you're like me you'll freak the fuck out at how accurate it is and be hooked.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did cause if so there's going to be an fuck-giving *deficit* from here on out. :-)

I wanted to share some philosophies that I recognized by going to an electronic music event in a foreign country by myself last night.  I am an avid concert goer and I came to some neat realizations from this experience.  I shall now lay down a few points and what i learned from it:

* First, never let anyone dictate your inner voice.  A friend of mine bailed on me for this show and past experiences indicated to me that I *should not* go alone, but I said fuck that and went.  Now, I've been to many events like this before, so it helped, but even then you must let go of the fucks and be at the mercy of the naturally-occurring.

* Be yourself.  That is the most important thing.  If you care about what other people are thinking of you, that is straight up INHIBITORY to self-actualization (hopefully I used that in the right context).  I danced my face off (as per usual) and no one cares, me being the one who cares *least*.  If your aim is to get attention, then put that whole notion aside and just be yourself -- it's much more effective.  You'd be surprised how positively people react.  If they react poorly, then fuck them and it was not meant to be.

* Let go of your expectations.  Live in the present moment and enjoy *the hell out of it*, because that is the point of living.  You may have anxiety, fear, or whatever, but you never know what is coming next.  I met so many friendly people from diverse backgrounds and it was exhilarating, but I had the expectation that I'd show up, watch, dance, and leave.  This was far from the case.

* As mentioned a bit before, let go of your past experiences.  I was so used to going with people to shows, but never realized the benefit of going alone, because you have more mental capacity to just observe your surroundings and your thoughts about it rather than having your attention on the group you came with.  My advice is that if you lose your friends at a concert, don't spend time looking for them, because you'll find them eventually.  Take that alone time to explore, dance, and maybe even make a few human connections. 

This can be summed up, to a degree, in the words of Brandon Boyd: *""lately I am beginning to find, that when I drive myself my light is found""*

Thanks for reading, honeybadgers. I encourage discussion and feedback.
  
Stay true to the cause.

My mom, brother, and grandma all have [myotonic dystrophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myotonic_dystrophy), and I take care of them. I'm a junior in high school. 
All four of us live in a two bedroom house. I sleep on a couch. My father was never a part of my life.

I used to give so many fucks. I was cutting, I was in therapy, I was pissed off and in a relationshit. He gave as many fucks as I did, and I dragged it on for too long. A year and a week, to be exact. I didn't have any friends because I was always scared to talk to people. I couldn't even fucking call and order pizza because I was so self conscious. 

But then I heard [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oh53Bmr4KkY). It's country, but I don't give a fuck. Here's the chorus in case you're also lazy as fuck:

*Life's not the breath you take*

*The breathing in and out*

*That gets you through the day*

*Ain't what it's all about*

*You just might miss the point*

*Trying to win the race*

*Life's not the breaths you take*

*But the moments that take your breath away*

Basically, it means to **fucking live**. So I do. I joined drama club, and i've done 8 full length productions. I chill with friends. I smoke pot occasionally and I smoke cigarettes, because fuck it, they make me feel nice.

I have a kickass boyfriend now who is my world. Our 2 year anniversary was a week ago. Not like you give a fuck, but he's helped me a lot in learning how not to give a fuck.

I don't cut anymore. I stopped caring about what people thought about me. I wear whatever the fuck I want to wear. 

I love my life. I love being able to wake up in the morning and do whatever the fuck I want.

If you still give fucks, don't. Don't worry about being the best. Don't worry about doing what makes your parents or peers proud. Don't worry about what *others* think of yourself.

This is your life. Whatever shit you have going on, suck it up. Make yourself happy. Whatever the fuck makes you happy, whether it's sitting on the couch eating doughnuts or going for a run, fucking do it. Don't focus on finding someone else to complete you. 

You can't love someone else if you can't even love yourself.

So what'd I do next? I texted my hot ass friend who I've been friends with for years and totally have a crush on. I was cool about it. Asked her if she wanted to go out sometime.

  Today is a beautiful summers day. Sun is shining and the temperature is just perfect. I was walking home while listening to music when [Michael Jackson's ""Wanna Be Starin' Something](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPTsmswQVwg) came on shuffle. A favourite song of mine that just makes me want to dance. As I am walking I got a surge of energy and I decided to say ""fuck it"" and started to skip/bounce step to the song. Doing this is something new but I'm glad I decided to do it. I just wanted to keep walking. The streets aren't too busy but I passed a handful of people and didn't stop because I was having too much fun grooving to the song.

 As a shy person I felt like this is one of my biggest steps in becoming a true honey badger. Next time you are walking and a song comes on that makes you want to dance, start skipping/bounce in your steps. Do it with lots of energy, it is a blast!

The point of my post is to tell you the answer to that question.  It is a simple answer.

I don't give a fuck.  When I am looking for a relationship, I look for very specific things, I am myself and I think I am respectful, romantic, etc.  I'm now happily married and what I'm talking about is all in the past, but I still think it's important to say.

When I just wanted to have fun, get laid, etc, the difference between my success and others' failure was simply the will to take action.  I would ask if she wanted to dance.  I would ask if she wanted to go home with me.  If I kissed her and she liked it, I would press my luck and see if she wanted more.  I read the signs - if my gut said she wanted to get it on, 100% of the time that was the case and I capitalised on that shit.

Throughout my wanderings between relationship posts and seduction technique and how to not be such a nice guy I came across a mention of this subreddit, so I decided to check it out. 

I was pleasantly surprised and definitely took a lot of advice from my readings, even more than i took from all of the other places I was looking before combined. I am just starting to NGAF, and I decided to pick out a few quotes or key ideas that I have found that I can refer to whenever I find myself GAF about anything. This is what I have so far:

How to Not Give a Fuck

*	Those that mind don’t matter, and those that matter don’t mind.

*	The lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.

*	Quit caring about people who aren’t going to come to your funeral.

*	Trying to change what you cannot is about as productive as trying to move a building with your bare hands.

*	Worrying about something you cannot change is a waste of your potential.

*	Everything is the way it is because everything was the way it was.

*	You shouldn’t try to change them, and they shouldn’t try to change you.

*	You cannot change the hand you are dealt, you can only change the way you play it.

*	Say yes to good things (and say no to bad things).

*	Tell that little judgmental son of a bitch in your head to shut the fuck up.

*	Make the best out of every situation.

*	It’s about how you see yourself, not how others see you.

*	You have to cut out the noise because the world is full of a lot of it.

*	Don’t take things personally.

*	Just let go!

Her photos showed that she had a little bit of weight, but they were mostly pics of her face/angle shots so I didn't realise how big she actually was. Not to say she's morbidly obese or anything, just bigger than what I was expecting.

Anyway, we ended up getting along really well together, and the sex was amazing. Over the past two weeks we've met up six times and while I wouldn't say I have serious feelings for her yet, I can definitely see it happening if we keep doing what we're doing. I also think it's safe to say she's feeling the same way about me. 

Generally in my life I try to give as few fucks as possible. And when it comes to spending time with this girl and sleeping with her - I don't give a fuck whatsoever that she's big. I personally don't care. What I give a fuck about (and what I really, really wish I didn't give a fuck about) is what other people would think/say about me if I decided to have a relationship with her. My friends in particular, because they're asshole 20-somethings, would give me shit about it. And even if they didn't give me shit, I would know for sure that they'd be joking about it behind my back. 

It sounds really shallow and I'm probably a horrible person to feel this way. I wish it wasn't such a big thing for me to overcome, but it is. My fucks are given.

Thank you r/howtonotgiveafuck, you have seriously helped me out a lot.  I'm not the best storyteller so bear with me.

I use to be really subconscious about what others thought about me, I tried to act like I didn't care on the outside and denied it whenever someone asked, but it was all a sham.  Then I discovered this subreddit I read some of the posts and about Project Mayhem, and was inspired to try and change my life.  This is my success story, hopefully it inspires others in return.

To start we find ourselves in Europe, I am in a generic Southern European country studying it's language to fufill some bullshit requirements for my university.  At the beginning I was still my bumbling awkward self, but eventually I found a group of kids that I could hang out with (literally all girls, the program was 50 people with 9 guys).  As the trip wore on I started to fall for one of the girls in my group of friends.  This is where the first minor step occurs, as she had a boyfriend back in the Canada.  I decided I didn't really give a fuck, and I was going to just keep on keepin' on, and this was the first step 
towards greatness.

The second step begins during one of the many shopping excursions I found myself dragged along.  They were shopping for swimsuits and then decided that it would be *hilarious* if I were to wear a speedo.  Now, before my moment of greatness I **never** would've worn a speedo, I was so subconcious about *every* little detail about myself.  I was super tall, super skinny, super pale, and I had a stark lack of body hair due to some native american influences, also I was a bit worried about the lack of coverage a speedo provided for my shnoiklers.  After a bit of coaxing on their part, I went into the changing rooms to find the size that would fit.  I looked myself in the eye, asked myself, ""What the fuck am I doing right now?"" and came to the wonderful conclusion that I didn't fucking care.

The second step finishes about 3 days later, when we all finally had enough time to go to the beach and I wore my speedo in public for the first time.  That moment, when I arrived on the crowded beach in nothing but a speedo, my pale white skin glowing like a firefly at midnight, I had to not give a fuck... there was simply no other option.  I ended up having a great time and gained a whole new level of self confidence that has utterly changed my life.  But that is not even the best part, that girl I mentioned earlier, with that boyfriend back in the Canada?  She broke up with him, and now she is reciprocating (woah, 
big word) those feelings of mine.

tl;dr - **wore a speedo to force myself to not give a fuck, won a girl's heart**

*Disclaimer - she did NOT break up because of me, there were other reasons involved*

I take a pragmatic approach to this, eliminating as many fucks as I can and making those I still have left a lot more manageable. So what I've found is a lot of my giving a fuck has to do with my expectations from the person/situation/etc.  It's only when I start wanting a bunch of shit that I get all worked up when it doesn't work out.  When I try to go through with an open mind and accept all possible outcomes things work out better and I feel better.  But to enter that state I ask myself a few questions:

1) Is there a specific outcome/reaction/etc. I'm looking for right now?  If so what is it?  I try to recognize what it is I want and why I am giving a fuck.

2) Do I really need this situation to go the way I want in order to stay stress-free?  Some things I really care about, like tests in school or something.  But when it's something else, like traffic or playing a video game,  I realize that I'm worrying myself over something that doesn't matter to me *at all*.  

3) Just because I give a fuck about this, is worrying going to help the situation improve?  This eliminates anything that happened in the past right off the bat.  I can care about it being rainy on my camping trip, but sometimes shit is out of my hands.  Recognition is the first step to elimination.

4) If I really do need this situation to go a certain way and giving a fuck does help, what can I do *right now* to make it better?  If I can't do anything about it, then it falls under question 3.  If there is something I can do about it right now...I do it!  But I have to do it right then and there.  Not to get too spiritual but all we have is right now and right here so it's the only point in time I have to do something about not giving a fuck.  Plus in my experience a little proactive-ness goes soooooo far in eliminating stress levels.  I may still care but I'm actively doing something to eliminate the feeling so it doesn't matter.

Anyway, this is the system I came up with.  Your results may vary and honestly with the right mindset you can find almost everything can be eliminated short of breathing.

My mother was the chronic malcontent.  She was--and remains--the kind of person who ruins an entire dinner party because the napkins weren't folded properly.  In college, she prevented me from going to the library at night by preemptively crying over my supposedly impending death before I left the house.  She has an uncanny ability to suss out the absolute worst case scenario and either worry endlessly about it becoming a reality, or make it so through ceaseless complaining.  She has an extremely cushy life, but chooses to be miserable anyway.  

And me?  In some ways, I am her twin.  

However, while the family thing is a real and ongoing part of the story, I'm a 24-year-old woman with a college degree and a job.  The onus is on me to grow some ovaries and overcome my conditioning at this point.  I need to retrain myself not to be such a dithering debbie downer.  Here is what I pledge to do from now on, as the first steps towards a better, happier life.

* Patience and phrasing.  For example, when my boyfriend doesn't do something right, like he loads the dishwasher with plates full of dried food, I don't come in waving the plate and say, ""What, did you think the dishwasher fairies were going to clean this?""  I cut my boyfriend some slack because he works hard and he's a great person.  Him not washing the dishes doesn't mean that we're going to end up like my parents.  

* Every night, come up with a list of at least five positive things that happened during the day.  When I am talking to people about what happened, I will focus on these things--not the traffic jam that made me late.  

* I won't make assumptions.  Won't conduct conversations as though I am avoiding an awkward moment, and will stand up for myself instead..  I will talk openly and directly, and say what I mean.  I won't assume everyone has it out for me or that they are going to judge me poorly based on what I say.  As long as I only say what I mean, it shouldn't matter anyway.

I want to start out small, so I don't get overwhelmed.  But I'd love to hear what you guys are working on, and what steps you take in your daily lives to give less of a fuck.

About a week ago I tried getting in touch with one of my ex co-workers (let's call her Jen.

It's always annoying when this happens and if one were to give a fuck, it would be in the ""Well, that's really rude of her"" category of fucks. Whatever, the conversation ends and i'm a little annoyed at her lack of a response. Is she ignoring me? Does she just not like me? What's going on?

A couple of days later she updates her profile with some information on what was going on. Does anybody care to take a guess at what it was? In a very M. Night Shyamalan-esque fashion:

She was in Kenya. Out of all the places in the world and things she could have been doing, she was on a mission trip in Kenya. If I had been given a million guesses, Kenya would not have been one of them.

So that's the story. Don't give a fuck about social interactions through facebook because the other person might be in Kenya.

I made this change because I had been dumped by my girlfriend of 6 and 1/2 years after she cheated on me with her boss, and something had to change. Beside the fact that I was single, I noticed that my life was not as I had hoped it would be.

1358978731.0,67,self.howtonotgiveafuck,175dmq,How to stop giving a fuck when it is difficult - letting go of attachment,thatisyou,73,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/175dmq/how_to_stop_giving_a_fuck_when_it_is_difficult/,"One problem with NGAF I've found, is that sometimes when we give a fuck about something, and decide we shouldn't give a fuck about it, it doesn't go away - but for some reason stays in the brain.  Sometimes when this happens, we get angry, because we want to NGAF about it, but for some reason we just can't let it go.

What to do then?

One way to think about this is to use the Buddhist idea of ""Attachments"".  Attachments are things that cause us to spin in circles when we try too hard to push them outside our mind.

For example, let's say I have horrible road rage, so I've decided I don't want to give a fuck about people cutting me off in traffic.  I can consciously stop myself from honking my horn and flipping the bird to people who cut me off in traffic, but if every time someone cuts me off , I still think ""fuck that asshole"" - in this case, I still have an attachment.  

Another example is if I broke up with my girlfriend, and decided I wanted to just forget about her.  If I keep myself from emailing her, calling her, talking to other people about her, but she's still in my thoughts, I am still attached to her (and still give a fuck about her).  

So by this line of thinking - how can I let go of my attachments - and therefore stop *really* giving a fuck?  The answer is to just let the thoughts be.  Let it lie.  You don't continue to give a fuck, but you don't lie to yourself when you are giving a fuck even though you don't want to.  

For instance, in the above example, if I break up with my girlfriend, and want to forget about her, but I'm still thinking about her, I just observe that thought.  I observe ""I want to forget about my ex-girlfriend, but I am still thinking of her.  That's fine, it is what it is.  Eventually I'll stop thinking about her.""

The point with attachments, is when we want to stop doing something, and when we can't seem to stop doing this thing, it often makes us frustrated.  And then the frustration makes us upset.  And it gnaws at us.

When we can step back from it, and see it for what it is, we don't bring additional energy to this thought process.  If we think: ""Hey, I'm still thinking about my ex, but that's ok, it's natural, it is what it is, and eventually over time it will go away."" - then we don't make our mind go around in circles.  And naturally we will find that the thoughts stop having power over us, and start to diminish in our minds.  That's when we are no longer ""attached"" to the thoughts, and are truly not giving a fuck.",,False,,t5_2tna8,False,,,True,t3_175dmq,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/175dmq/how_to_stop_giving_a_fuck_when_it_is_difficult/,

Think of something that you seem to give a fuck about, or something your uncertain is worth a fuck, or even something that others seem to give a fuck about.  And put it to this test.  Everyone's results will be different.  And we tend to half-ass try and imagine this scenario, perhaps not wanting to experience the sadness or whatever emotions are brought up.

When I tell stories, I often find that I try to make them interesting or exciting with the way I tell them.  I also tend to try to keep them shorter to accommodate attention spans.  Not bad things in themselves, but I realize that I do this because I have believed that the content of my story must be able to stand alone in order to be a worthwhile tale.

However, what this perspective neglects is an awareness of the teller of the story.  In addition to hearing a story, my listener is also getting to experience.. me.  If my listener is genuinely interested in me, then this will add value to my story simply because I am expressing myself and allowing the listener to get to know me.  Even if the story itself bores my listener, there is every possibility that he/she will be entertained by my self-expression.  I use ""entertained"" to indicate I held the listener's attention and he/she enjoyed listening.

This post is a result of:  Me allowing myself to recognize that I am interesting to some people, just as a consequence of being me.  Not always what I consciously bring to the table.

This is my New Year's Resolution and I hope some of you have something similar. From midnight on (mountain time), no more giving two shits about what anybody else expects of me, thinks of me, wants from me, etc.  

This applies to ever aspect of my life:

Socially: I'm speaking my mind, standing up for myself and taking more risks, introducing myself to people and striking up conversations with people I feel like I want to talk to.

Hobbies: Fuck it! I'll start playing my harmonicas in public, shit I may even put a hat on the ground in front of me if I'm in a city. I'll try my hand at stand-up comedy if I fail, who gives a shit? I gave it a shot. 

Health: I don't care what people think of my routine anymore, this anxiety will not stop me from going to workout anymore, and I am not working out so other people think I look good, but because I want to feel good and I think I deserve a healthy body. 

Education/Career: Who cares what someone else thinks I should be studying? I'm studying something I'm interested in and enjoy learning about, and I don't want to go into the big business money making profession. I am going to pursue my dream of coaching baseball by aiming for an eventual high school teaching job, who cares how everyone else sees teachers? Shit I'll get 3 months off. 

Women: Friend doesn't think a girl is that hot? Don't care. Girl thinks I should look or act differently? Fuck that, I don't need her, etc.

and on and on and on. 

From now on, this is my attitude. I know this will not always stick, and I plan to catch myself when I'm giving too many fucks and figure out how to get back to NGAF, even if it means I have to appear vulnerable and ask for help. 

So everyone, I hope you are feeling the same way this NYE or New Year, depending on what time zone you are in. Remember to put yourself first. That doesn't mean to be a dickhead and not help someone in need, in fact, that means go help a stranger out because you will feel good about doing it, no matter how weird it may look.

It’s Christmas and I have the usual problem of deciding what to give you. I know you might enjoy many things — books, games, clothes.

But I’m very selfish. I want to give you something that will stay with you for more than a few months or years. I want to give you a gift that might remind you of me every Christmas.

If I could give you just one thing, I’d want it to be a simple truth that took me many years to learn. If you learn it now, it may enrich your life in hundreds of ways. And it may prevent you from facing many problems that have hurt people who have never learned it.

The truth is simply this:

No one owes you anything.

Significance

How could such a simple statement be important? It may not seem so, but understanding it can bless your entire life.

No one owes you anything.

It means that no one else is living for you, my child. Because no one is you. Each person is living for himself; his own happiness is all he can ever personally feel.

When you realize that no one owes you happiness or anything else, you’ll be freed from expecting what isn’t likely to be.

It means no one has to love you. If someone loves you, it’s because there’s something special about you that gives him happiness. Find out what that something special is and try to make it stronger in you, so that you’ll be loved even more.

When people do things for you, it’s because they want to — because you, in some way, give them something meaningful that makes them want to please you, not because anyone owes you anything.

No one has to like you. If your friends want to be with you, it’s not out of duty. Find out what makes others happy so they’ll want to be near you.

No one has to respect you. Some people may even be unkind to you. But once you realize that people don’t have to be good to you, and may not be good to you, you’ll learn to avoid those who would harm you. For you don’t owe them anything either.

Living your Life

No one owes you anything.

You owe it to yourself to be the best person possible. Because if you are, others will want to be with you, want to provide you with the things you want in exchange for what you’re giving to them.

Some people will choose not to be with you for reasons that have nothing to do with you. When that happens, look elsewhere for the relationships you want. Don’t make someone else’s problem your problem.

Once you learn that you must earn the love and respect of others, you’ll never expect the impossible and you won’t be disappointed. Others don’t have to share their property with you, nor their feelings or thoughts.

If they do, it’s because you’ve earned these things. And you have every reason to be proud of the love you receive, your friends’ respect, the property you’ve earned. But don’t ever take them for granted. If you do, you could lose them. They’re not yours by right; you must always earn them.

My Experience

A great burden was lifted from my shoulders the day I realized that no one owes me anything. For so long as I’d thought there were things I was entitled to, I’d been wearing myself out — physically and emotionally — trying to collect them.

No one owes me moral conduct, respect, friendship, love, courtesy, or intelligence. And once I recognized that, all my relationships became far more satisfying. I’ve focused on being with people who want to do the things I want them to do.

That understanding has served me well with friends, business associates, lovers, sales prospects, and strangers. It constantly reminds me that I can get what I want only if I can enter the other person’s world. I must try to understand how he thinks, what he believes to be important, what he wants. Only then can I appeal to someone in ways that will bring me what I want.

And only then can I tell whether I really want to be involved with someone. And I can save the important relationships for those with whom I have the most in common.

It’s not easy to sum up in a few words what has taken me years to learn. But maybe if you re-read this gift each Christmas, the meaning will become a little clearer every year.

I hope so, for I want more than anything else for you to understand this simple truth that can set you free: no one owes you anything.",Revelation,False,,t5_2tna8,False,revelation,,True,t3_1jd51r,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/1jd51r/no_one_owes_you_anything/,

My emotionally, physically, and sexually abusive ex had drunk dialed me using another phone; I'd blocked his number some time ago. There was no threatening language in his message, but I immediately felt sick to my stomach and like the tears couldn't come out fast enough. I made the break 8 months ago. I spoke to the police. I stopped seeing him, stopped responding to harassing calls and texts. I moved to another part of the country. Why the fuck was that not clear enough for him? Why was he still doing this to me? Then, as quickly as it came, my panic subsided. I made a major realization. I am not a victim. I am a survivor. I survived that abuse and am stronger for it. I survived that relationship and learned more about myself and others than I would have otherwise. I'm not glad it happened, but it's helped build the awesome person I am today. I gave a fuck about my own well-being enough to make that break, as hard as it was, and to take care of myself today when I knew I was fragile. I didn't give a fuck about continuing to ignore him. I acknowledged and accepted the trauma, but focused on who I am now rather than what happened then. Proper fucks were given, and I feel great.

We would often joke around about each other for fun but gradually she became more bitter and sarcastic with her comments. And for awhile, I would actually give a fuck when she made comments.

I am currently in a same sex relationship, but closeted (for personal reasons not related to giving a fuck) so no one at my school currently knows. If I make gender jokes occasionally, in good fun of course, she often has to make a back-handed comment about me, find some personal insult, or comment on how that's ""why I'm single."" 

She would also have a habit of if she was around and I was talking, she suddenly would say ""No one cares Sam"" or ""Why are you still talking?"" And that would irk me so bad, and I'd gotten close to blowing up at her before. Till I realized there was no reason to.

Her single comments mean nothing because I have a wonderful boyfriend, her insults mean nothing about who I am, and her ""nobody cares"" comments mean nothing because people are intently listening to me when she says them. I had this revelation today when I was telling some friends about reddit (with a redditor friend at the table next to us) and when I paused in talking, I heard this girl say to my redditor friend ""why is he even still talking?"" 

And then I noticed my friend blow off her comment and ignore her, and my friend said to me ""She probably just wants to start trouble."" And that was exactly it.

I noticed she texted someone a couple times then literally the same time the food came she got a phone call and suddenly had an emergency and had to leave. She made a huge scene of it and loudly apologized (some BS about her ex and their son) over and over, basically got everyones attention around us that I was being left on a date. It was obvious she just didn't want to stay for the rest or lunch and texted her friend to call her. I have seen it in movies but never heard of it actually happen before IRL (kinda hurt).

I sit in my usual table facing the TV on the wall and to my right are two boys...in my usualy IDGAF way I strike up a rather random conversation with them. I ask them their ages, they say 12/13 (8th grade) and I realize they go to my old middle school. I ask if certain teachers are there, they answer...convo goes well and they seem genuinely intrigued.

So I begin to dole out the life advice.

""You go to HS next year right?""

""Yea""

""Well let me tell you the most important thing about HS.""

*kids lean in in anticipation*

""It doesn't mean a fucking thing.""

at this point they laugh. so I interrupt them.

""Not joking...I mean yea, you have to do what you have to to get ahead, but that's about all that matters...I graduated from **local HS** in 2001, nothing that happened then matters now aside from the fact that some of my friends from them are still my friends today. All the petty drama, the social nightmare, the bullshit feelings, the insecurity, etc...does. not. mean. a fucking. thing.""

*""Really?"" They ask (Well one asked, but both were thinking it)*

""Absolutely...I can't even begin to think about all the bullshit that occupied so much of my time that I can't even remember...as much sense as that makes.""

""And let me tell you about college.""

*""what about it?""*

""Hardly means a fucking thing. Yea you definitely need this to get ahead, so definitely do what you need to do for you, same as HS, but all the cliquey bullshit, the drama, the girls, the emotional insecurity, etc, etc...meaningless...Today, it doesn't mean a thing.""

*""whoa really?""*

""Yep...and shit, adulthood isn't much either...you do what you need to do, sure, but beyond the necessities, a majority of the bullshit in life does not matter...avoid it if you can...and definitely try your hardest to use your mind over your emotions.""

**I continued here doling out my philosophy about dealing with problems**

""Also, just a protip for life in general...when something happens...flat tire, fired, dumped, sickness in the family, anything that pretty much happened...try your hardest not to let emotions take over and sit there pouting and crying and stressing and altogether not doing a damn thing to solve your problem and just say to yourself, verbally or mentally. ***'well THAT has happened...so now that that has happened, what can I do to fix whatever happened.'*** Bitching and moaning doesn't solve a thing. Action does...and a majority of life is forgotten so try not to sweat the bullshit.""

""You began dying the second you were born, then one day you're old if you're lucky, then you're dead...enjoy life as life...do not let the pitiful meaningless nuances of everyday being take away too much of your life. And I'm done.""

=======================

At this point they were already finished eating for like 5-10 minutes now just listening to me speak...they cleaned up and as they left thanked me for the advice.

I'm not sure how much will actually stick with a 12/13 year old...but hopefully I gave these kids some life advice that will help them in the future.

=======================

    TL;DR - two kids got a lesson in life from a strange black townie.    

edit: to clarify I didn't paraphrase well but the message definitely came off as more of a ""ignore the bullshit"" than ""the nihilist manifesto""

There were other patrons in the bar who did everything but give me an ovation, standing or otherwise, after my speech.

Kitchen Confidential - Anthony Bourdain
-He gives away 30 years of restaurant secrets, plus it's funny as shit.

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Lewis Carrol
-Many arguments can be made as to what exactly was going on is this guy's head when he was writing this. Regardless of what your take on it is, it's a good read.

The Book of Ecclesiastes
-We read a lot about Lao Tzu, but the Bible also has a few gems. The work emphatically proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently ""vain"", ""futile"", ""empty"", ""meaningless"", ""temporary"", ""transitory"", ""fleeting,"" or ""mere breath,"" depending on translation, as the lives of both wise and foolish men end in death. While Qoheleth, the author, clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life, he is unable to ascribe eternal meaning to it. In light of this perceived senselessness, he suggests that one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of God.

I'm almost done with The Fall now, and Jesus Christ is it easily one of the best things I've ever read. 

""So what's the good of dying intentionally, of sacrificing yourself to the idea you want people to have of you? Once you are dead, they will take advantage of it to attribute idiotic or vulgar motives to your action. Martyrs must choose between being forgotten, mocked, or made use of. As for being understood - never!""

""But to be happy it is essential not to be too concerned with others.""

""Man diminishes man's powers. The world leaves them intact.""

""Believe me, there is no such thing as great suffering, great regret, great memory. Everything is forgotten, even a great love. That is what's sad about life, and also what's wonderful about it.""

""Just as there is a moment when the artist must stop, when the sculpture must be left as it is, the painting untouched - so there must be a minimum of ignorance to perfect a life of happiness. Those who lack such a thing must set about acquiring it: unintelligence must be earned.""  
    -*A Happy Death*

""You could get used to anything. The first months [in jail] were hard. But in fact, the effort I had to make helped pass the time...Once I learned how to remember things, I wasn't bored at all.

I dated her once in May 2012, she became flighty, and after about 4 dates after her, I became disenchanted with dating and started to look inward into the problem. It was me. So, I joined /r/seduction, absorbed everything they had, and started going about fixing myself. By the end of summer, I found myself in a relationship. 

It wasn't a great relationship by any means. She was young and idealistic, but I was just zen as FUCK by then. She kept trying to shape and mold me, and she did. Just not in the way she was hoping for. By November, we'd reached an impasse and the whole thing exploded.

By then, the original girl had walked back into my life. We started out as friends, then over time, we were hanging out more and more, and eventually she broke up with her boyfriend. 

I thought literally nothing of it, in fact at that point I had dated her best friend once. Until she had a date with some other guy...with me and her aforementioned best friend present. It was painfully clear she didn't want to be there, in fact I implored her to try to sit down with this guy instead of finding excuses to not be in the same room with him. After enough musical chairs, me and her friend left.

The next day after sending me this long letter that her date sent her about his grievances with her, she then proceeded to tell me that it was weird that I kept trying to get her to sit with him, because she liked me. 

I wish I could say I was indifferent to it, but my furniture and noise complaints say otherwise.

After assuring her it wasn't weird, I said it's fine and moved on with our plans for that Sunday. Where I planned on telling her I reciprocated. Instead, we saw Veronica Falls on that Friday and made out a lot.

Here's where it gets super shitty.

I texted her to see if she would still be on for Sunday, after some assurance, she then canceled and said wait for Tuesday. Okay, Tuesday it is. Whoops, no, gotta cancel. By this time, I knew she was leaving for Spring Break, so I was ready to just let it go altogether, so I told her so. No, no, no. We'll do it when I get back. I felt myself seething with anger, so I deliberately avoided contact with her until she contacted me. She asks for plans again, and flakes on them again.  
She then begins the process called the [fade away](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr8HKRTavM0). 

I lose my shit. I start to give WAY too much fucks. My general well-being, mentally and physically start to deteriorate. Everything I've learned goes down the shitter. 

Until I start working hard again. 

But now, I get met with a lot criticism. At the top of the list it's ""you didn't change.""

Today, it hit me. I did change. I changed multiple times. I've probably seen literally more than my detractors have ever seen. ""People never change"" is a selfish criticism that means ""this person hasn't become the person I want them to become."" I'm not here to do that. I'm here to become to person I want to become. And the first step to do that, is to not give ANY fucks.

She agreed, now when we got there instead of pussy footing around the topic, I just came right out adn told her how I felt, and how she hurt me. I was getting ready to leave, figuring she would be mad, I didn't care, but she stopped me.

I've been reading this book before finding this sub and am amazed at how much the two are alike, and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for extra resources on how to NGAF.  At any rate, this is one small part of the book where he explains a daily program of cheerful and constructive thinking:


Just For Today

1. Just for today I will be happy.  This assumes that what Abraham Lincoln said is true, that ""most folks are about as happy as they make up their minds to be.""  Happiness is from within; it is not a matter of externals.

2. Just for today I will try to adjust myself to what is, and not try to adjust everything to my own desires.  I will take my family, my business, and my luck as they come and fit myself to them.

3. Just for today I will take care of my body.  I will exercise it, care for it, nourish it, not abuse it nor neglect it, so that it will be a perfect machine for my bidding.

4. Just for today I will try to strengthen my mind.  I will learn something useful.  I will not be a mental loafer.  I will read something that requires effort, thought and concentration.

5. Just for today I will exercise my soul in three ways; I will do somebody a good turn and not get found out.  I will do at least two things I don't want to do, as William James suggests, just for exercise.  (WJ was mentioned earlier in the chapter)

6. Just for today I will be agreeable.  I will look as well as I can, dress as becomingly as possible, talk low, act courteously, be liberal with praise, criticize not at all, nor find fault with anything and not try to regulate nor improve anyone.

7. Just for today I will try to live through this day only, not to tackle my whole life problem at once.  I can do things for twelve hours that would appall me if I had to keep them up for a lifetime.

8. Just for today I will have a program.  I will write down what I expect to do every hour.  I may not follow it exactly, but I will have it.  It will eliminate two pests, hurrying and indecision.

9. Just for today I will have a quiet half-hour all by myself and relax.  In this half-hour sometimes I will think of God, so as to get a little more perspective into my life.

10. Just for today I will be unafraid, especially I will not be afraid to be happy, to enjoy what is beautiful, to love, and to believe that those I love, love me.


Take these however you want (e.g. you may not believe in God so you can disregard that part of #9), and use whichever of these you may think is most beneficial - or use them all!  I've begun using these and it's been an incredible motivator in my life.  Although it's not a cure-all for the fucks I am giving in life, it certainly is helping me get there, and has provided the right guidelines for a mental framework in which I can NGAF about stupid things.

The owner of our company is my direct boss. He is an overall good guy but when he is pissed he loses it an takes everything out on me and threatens to fire me for what other people are doing wrong.

One example was last week. I work 7-5:30 or sometimes 6. My actual working hours are 7:30 - 4:30.

Fuck this shit. I've been alone. I've also been ""with"" someone. Here's what I've learned:

1) abusive relationship &lt; bad relationship &lt; average relationship &lt; **being single**  &lt; good relationship

2) being single != being alone

3) as number of fucks distributed decreases, number of dates increases.

My last *relationship* was 5 years ago. It was pretty good, but not meant to last. I haven't given a fuck about dating since then. What have I done in the mean time? Focused on **making friends**. 

I'm hanging out with friends tonight to have beers and shoot the shit. I'm not dating on valentines day, but I'm sure as fuck not alone. It feels pretty damn good. 

As we stop giving a fuck about *being single* it becomes much easier for us to talk to people confidently. Notice I said *people* and not *individuals of the gender we are sexually attracted to*. Separating *potential dates* from *people* is what makes it so difficult for us to approach people because it causes us to completely forget they're *just people*. 

People actually love to meet other people. People love it when someone takes an interest in them. People love it when someone smiles, says hi and asks what they're up to.

So stop giving a fuck. No one's judging you, no one who matters. Relax. Got a friend to hang out with? Hang out with that friend. Got no plans? Fuck it, focus on yourself. Do something you've always wanted to do. Define yourself a little stronger.

First off, a beat battle is a tournament where producers who make hip hop beats go up on stage, play their beats against another producer, and get judged by a panel on who's beats were better. Then if you win, you go to the next round. It's set up as a [single elimination bracket.](http://imgur.com/8GCVp)

I was so fucking nervous for a month before this battle. I almost told the person who set it up to just find someone else to be in it. I did NOT want to go. I set myself up so I couldn't not go by inviting all my friends. I knew I couldn't not go if all my friends were coming because I didn't want to look like a pussy. (I guess that's kinda giving a fuck, but it was my way of forcing myself to go.)

A week before the battle, and everyday gets worse. Whenever I think about the battle, my stomach goes crazy with nervousness. I really didn't want to go, but I have to. 

The day of the battle, I'm having all kinds of anxiety attacks throughout the day. Maybe my beats suck? Maybe people will laugh at me?

I finally get to the place, really early, so I can get used to the setting and ease myself into all the people that will be there. People start piling into the small venue, and it's starting to look like a LOT of people. (really, it was only about 75.. which is still a lot for me) 

3 hours later, they finally start pulling names from the hat and filling up the brackets with the producers. I'm in the second to last round. Not only am I going to have to wait until everyone else goes, which is going to build up my anxiety even more just waiting to go up there, but I also have to psych myself out thinking that everyone's beats are better than mine.. AND on top of that.. I'm going against the guy who fucking made the beat for [""Hot Cheetos and Takis""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YLy4j8EZIk) which is a pretty dope beat, and well known around the Twin Cities area.

They call my name, and I go up there, place my CD of beats in the CDJ and they ask me heads or tails. I pick tails. It's heads. The other producer makes me go first. My legs are shaking, and it feels like I'm about to have a panic attack. I press play on my beat, and I am too afraid to look up at the crowd, because I know that if I look, they'll all be looking at me and all those faces will no doubt put me into panic attack mode. 

I play my first beat, I can't tell if people like it or not because the speakers are too loud and drowning out people's reactions, and I'm to afraid to look. Then the other guy plays his beat, and I look at the crowd and it looks like they are just going crazy for his beat. I'm thinking ""fuck...""

I play my second beat, still too afraid to look at the crowd. 

He plays his second beat.. Not it's time for the judges.

The first judge says, ""wow! this was the best battle of the whole night so far. I gotta hear another beat from both of them to make my decision."" Which hasn't happened in any of the other battles so far. So I was taken by surprise. The other judges agree with the first judge, saying they wanna hear another beat. 

At this point I just wanna get off stage. So I bust out the best beat I have on my CD and this time I look at the crowd.. They went NUTS!! This is the first time I've thought to myself ""hmm.. maybe I do make good beats."" So I started acting all wild on stage, jumping around and throwin' up the first pump acting all stupid. It was the first time I've not given a fuck and just went nuts. 

The other dude plays his beat, and then go to the judges. 

They ALL picked me to win the round. Man, that was a good feeling.

So I'm in the next round, and I wanted to take my NGAF attitude to this round. I go up there, and I'm not feeling ANY anxiety at all. It was awesome. It's truly the biggest moment of not giving a fuck I have ever felt.

I win that round.

Next round I'm in, I get knocked out, but that's okay because the guy who beat me went on to win the whole battle.

But man, when I got off stage from the first battle, people were coming up to me saying all kinds of things like ""MAN THOSE BEATS WERE DOPE!!"" and all kinds of people wanting to work with me on some music in the future. 

So.. after all that.. I'm REALLY glad I did it. It's given me a new sense of not giving a fuck, and a HUGE ego boost.

The brother and sister invited me out for poker, but instead we went out for Korean food with friends, as the people they introduced me to really enjoyed my company. They met me at the metro station, the sister was laid back as usual at the beginning as her brother and I found out that were both nerds, further finding common ground. After we had Korean the sister and I danced for everyone and I taught her to salsa and merengue and she taught me swing dancing. She and I spent good time cuddled up, neither GAF what the others thought.  Everything went perfect, even when we had to walk in the snow to my apartment bc the metros had stopped running.

I just stopped worrying about the end result and enjoyed being there with everyone in that moment and the social shyness faded away.

I wanted to share with all of you that the results have been pretty amazing, and I've been having an amazing week as a result.

First, I stopped worrying about how I don't like interviews and applied for a promotion! At this point I've gone through 2 of the 4 interviews necessary, and have been able to be so relaxed about them that they've both gone really well. I've even been able to work the honey badger philosophy into one of the interviews by talking about how I prefer to manage issues (of course I dressed it up a bit, but it was definitely in my mind.) 

Second, I stopped worrying about having too much responsibility, and nominated myself to the top leadership position of a local organization, with the idea that at very worst, I wouldn't have to do any more work. Well last I heard I'm in the lead, as the only other guy running against me didn't actually want the top position, and voted for me instead, and I should be hearing the final decision on that in 3 hours.

Finally, following up with my original comment, I finally went and talked to this absolutely gorgeous girl that I'd seen a few times. We ended up talking for a while, went out to lunch on Monday, and I'm planning to see her again on Saturday. 

I cannot believe how awesome this mindset has proven for me. I'm looking at possibly getting two promotions, both of which will help me immensely in the future, and I even have a shot with this amazing girl. I hope that my experience can help inspire someone else, because this kind of success is something everyone should be able to get.

The best part is that I know that even if none of it works out, I won't worry because I'll still be doing ok for myself, and I'll know that I tried my best and gave it my all.

Just wanted to give a quick thanks to you all for this subreddit. I've spent the past few months in a state of virtual stagnation, and pseudo-panic, due to getting incredibly caught up with a million ""what-if's"" and the idea that what I am trying to do in life might not succeed. 

Last night you made me realise ""Who gives a fuck!?"". This influences nobody else but me, the things that have already happened can't be changed, the things that will or won't happen are entirely dependent on my own actions and if they do or don't, nobody gives a fuck, and if life doesn't pan out the way I had pictured in my head, who gives a fuck?! Life's malleable, I can choose something else. 

So fuck it! 

Last night I stopped clinging to fucks! I put a deposit down on a border collie puppy to be picked up when he's ready in a week, worked hard, went to bed feeling unstressed, and woke up feeling ready to do... whatever! 

Life is too good to give a fuck.

Those subreddits being: /r/meditation, /r/nofap and of course this one.  Unfortunately just deciding that ""I'm not going to give a fuck anymore"" doesn't really do much for you.  You have to take practical steps in changing the way you think and look at life.

/r/meditation - Meditation alone will change entirely the amount of fucks you give in daily life.  You can view your fucks as attention.  Whatever your attention is on you're giving fucks about.  Meditation helps you train this attention so you can actually choose to shift your focus from things like outward appearance, social status, worries and anxieties to things that actually matter like family, friends, goals and so on.  Once you start, you'll realize just how little control you had over your focus before.  Look at all the yogis and gurus in india that practice hours of meditation a day.  You think they give a single fuck what anyone thinks? They're in a constant state of bliss, acceptance and indifference.  Along with helping you give less fucks other benefits include increased focus, clarity, happiness, relaxation and the ability to flow with life.  The redditators on /r/meditation are very wise, insightful and very willing to help newcomers and answer any questions you may have about meditation. Meditation has completely changed mine and many others lives so don't knock it until you try it.  

/r/nofap - Nofap is the ultimate challenge of willpower that is giving up the habit of masturbation.  Why would anyone do this you ask? Because of the undeniably rewarding benefits like increased confidence, energy, deeper voice and better concentration.  A lot of people start nofap because of a condition called porn induced erectile dysfunction.  If you want to know more about it I suggest you watch this TEDx video: [The Great Porn Experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU).  This period of abstinence from fapping along with giving up porn rewires the brain and helps sufferers of ED regain the ability to get erections.  They say the average recovery time is 90 days but for some it takes longer.  Along with helping you regain control of your peep almost every nofap subscriber(fapstronaut) experiences the benefits mentioned above in different intensities.  It's obvious how increased confidence can help you give less fucks and change your life for the better.  Don't believe it works?  Just give it 7 days and you'll see how well it works.  Me and 68,000 other fapstronauts can attest to this.  It's no cakewalk though.  You will be hornier than you've ever felt before and realize just how addicting porn really is.  I've been subscribed to nofap for around 8 months and my longest streak is only 23 days.  But I'm currently holding a 21 day streak and I feel fucking awesome! Despite the negative stimga surrounding /r/nofap I find that a lot of the members are very down to earth and supportive. If some members seem overly enthusiastic about it, it's because it actually does work surprisingly well. 

Well, that's all I've got to say guys.  Just wanted to share two ideas that have had incredible transformative power in my life. Thanks for reading.

I gave way too many fucks last night. Practically kicked rocks the whole way home, feeling sorry for myself. Got up today, still felt derp. It took a good two hours for the honey badger to oust the little bitch in my brain and regain control.

You WANT these things, it may even feel like you NEED them, but you won't get them that way. You must earn them.

You are a screaming ball of cosmic awesome traveled across time and space to this time and place to cause a ruckus and have fun doing it. 

Your life is a gold-pan. Shake the fuck out of it, the bullshit will fall through, and the good shit will be there for you when you're done shaking. Don't force it, just do your thing and wait for everybody else to catch up.

I had lost my job, and was having trouble finding work.  For two years.  (I later found out this was due to an incorrect entry in a national criminal database saying I had a criminal record)  I'd put in applications, get interviews which went well, then nothing.  When would call, they'd 'hired someone more qualified'.  During this time, I lost my house, my car, my investments, my savings - basically everything I owned.  I worked odd jobs, did contract work, whatever it took to make ends meet, but I wasn't able to pay all the bills.

Naturally this meant calls from bill collectors.  And letters.  And more calls.  Sometimes the calls were pretty bad.  They'd get really pushy and try anything to get me to come up with money I didn't have, and more than a few were abusive.

It got bad enough that when a local lawyer advertised a free 1 hr consultation, I went to go see him about declaring bankruptcy.  He looked at my assets and finances and said there was no point, as you declare bankruptcy to protect assets from creditors, and I had nothing to protect.

I went home and thought about that - and I realized that the reason those bill collectors had been able to be abusive is because I let them.  ...and I let them because I gave a fuck about trying to repay the debt, and they abused that.  With no ability to repay, no assets to protect, and my credit rating already ruined, I realized *there was nothing they could do to me*.  Sure, they could sue, but I had no money, no assets and no prospects of that changing - so all suing was going to do was cost them money.

It was incredibly liberating the next time one of the abusive bill collectors called and got abusive, to not give a fuck and be just as abusive right back.  I still remember the shocked voice in which she said ""You can't talk to me that way!""  ...whereupon I explained to her that I could talk to her ""any way I please, bitch"" (she never called me again).

I eventually got the records thing cleared up (once I found out about it), got a job, and got my life back on track.

Objectively, it was easy to not give a fuck under those circumstances - I literally had nothing to lose - but it was a new way of thinking that took some adjustment.",,False,,t5_2tna8,False,,,True,t3_u33u9,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/u33u9/my_first_idgaf_moment_as_an_adult/,

Yes I'm a crazy person. No I don't have a death wish. And of course there's *some* kind of hypothesis at work, it's just difficult to get sciency with subjectivity.

I guess you could say that the end goal here is a fresh understanding of both suffering and gratitude. Not that I'm looking forward to the suffering aspect of it all, but I am still desperately curious. Reason being: we live in a world that allows [20,000+](http://www.statisticbrain.com/world-hunger-statistics/) people to die **daily** as a result of starvation alone, while other people are buying electronic rectangles for their obese 10 year olds that cost more than 6 months of rations. It was chance alone that put me in a place where I could observe the latter, instead of being a nameless victim of the former.

So yeah, giving a fuck and how not to - how does this all link in with that key directive? What's the grand point? The epiphany? The revelation that this will provide? Well it isn't at all complicated really - it's just simple appreciation. Appreciation for having those things to potentially give a fuck about.

*Side note ~ minor things like the fap limit, or the game ban - they're included because, while this is partly an emulation of poverty, it's also a stripping of my modernised, apathetic lifestyle. So basically, I'm curious to see how I'll fair without the perks.*

It's about me having the best night of my life.

Alright, a bit about me before my report.  I've been a long time lurker and have thoroughly observed different methods and approaches for meeting the ladies. They have helped me a little bit but I have found my own method that seemed to have worked.  I wouldn't even call it a method, its really just a situation of go for it and have a good time.  This obviously will only really work in certain situations. I am a 24 year-old fat guy (312 lbs, lost 28 so far, well on my way to my weight loss goal). That being said, I've always been very insecure and self conscious.  I still have my V-Card and it has bothered me until these past 3 months that I have been going out.  Anyways, I've always enjoyed the club scene as I am a huge fan of EDM.  Not the best location for approaching the ladies but I figured it would be a good place to start - giving me a good challenge.  I have been a frequent patron of this club and the staff all know me because initially I was ""That Guy"" that hung out in the corner watching. They worked on getting me out of my shell and I became more open. Yes, I was a creeper all due to my awkwardness and social retardation at the beginning.  I had opened up a bit but I still had approach anxiety and was still very self conscious. Hell, I was still awkward with hugs to be honest, due to my extreme lack of experience and physical interaction with women.  I had danced with a few girls that would drag me onto the dance floor but that was it.

Now we move to this past Saturday night.  There were ladies everywhere. Don't know what was special about this night but there were countless more an usual.  I approached 2 that I found attractive and seemed cool, only to find out they were with their boyfriends.  No biggie, brushed it off (rejection used to always haunt me). After observing, everyone else was in a group and I figured the night was over as far as chances are concerned.  Music was blaring, and I figured well, I might as well enjoy myself while I'm here.  I began to dance to the music, by myself.  Now whenever I had danced before but it wasn't much. It was fun but I always felt awkward and self conscious.  Well, this past Saturday night I decided, I don't give a fuck.  I came to the realization that I am here to have a good time and if anyone else stares, laughs at my horrible moves, whatever - that's their deal.  I started going at it, moved onto the middle of the dance floor.  After the first song or two, I began to notice I was drawing attention to myself. Soon enough, after another minute or so, everyone on the floor had noticed me and started dancing with me.  The ladies were all over me.  I had never ""grinded"" until that point, was interesting to say the least.  Guys were cheering me on, it was insane.  The DJ knew me and I got a couple shout outs over the speaker system which fueled the whole situation.  Did I mention I can't dance at all?   I was just jamming to the music.  Now picture this fat guy that is sweating his ass off, out of breath, having a blast.  I can honestly say it was the best time of my life.

Out of this experience, before leaving the club, I received 3 numbers from extremely attractive  girls who I never would have dreamed of approaching to begin with - who wanted to go out sometime to grab a drink or hang out.  I was invited to 4 different after parties (was only able to attend 2 unfortunately).  At the first party I was able to obtain 2 more numbers. I didn't use any approach methods - just had a good time dancing to the music with people and I was the one being approached.  At the second after party, I had my first kiss with a girl.  Yes, cheesy but I had never kissed anyone before.  She was an 8 - gorgeous brunette.  Final count: 5 phone numbers and 1 kiss.

So, after that novel - the moral of the story...  What worked for me in the end was not giving a single fuck about anything and just diving right in to do what I enjoyed.  That openness and cavalier mentality got me attention that I never imagined.  I know this will not help everyone but I hope it at least help those who are in a similar situation I started in (having difficulty getting out there and just ""doing"").  If you are self conscious about doing something that you enjoy - understand that everyone in that venue is there to have a good time.  Nobody cares what you do or how you do it as long as you enjoy yourself.

TL;DR - Fat guy here, initially very awkward and self conscious, decided to go for broke and ended up getting numbers and a kiss without even trying and having a good time.",,False,,t5_2tna8,False,,,True,t3_10f81b,http://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/10f81b/epic_night_out_screw_it_zero_fucks_given/,

My keys, phone, headshot photos, resume, and my AAA card were locked inside.
no hide-a-key
FUCK
So then I think to myself  ""Wait I'm an actor, time to play the honey badger. What is the honey badger's motivation? Nothing. Because honey badgers don't give a shit!""

Not even worried if i got the part or not. Just had a good time!

UPDATE: Funny coinky-dink. I did the math on how much it would cost in gas to drive there and back for all the rehearsals and realized i couldn't afford it so Iwas thinking about letting them know i couldn't do the show just in case I got cast.

3) Think about having to act the *same. exact. way.* every moment of your life in order to keep whatever outcome you desire from that situation.

4) Now consider this more fully/deeply: If you have to fight, manipulate, complain, struggle to get what you want, do you want to keep doing this indefinitely every moment of your life? Or would you rather accept what comes with not giving a fuck each moment to the next?
