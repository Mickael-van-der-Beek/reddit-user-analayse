1323231422.0,375,self.badcompany2,n3hen,Did I just invent a new dish?,,456,81,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/n3hen/did_i_just_invent_a_new_dish/,"So... tonight I was at home drunk and got really hungry, prompting myself to start cooking with whatever ingredients I could scrounge together in my kitchen. I'm a college kid and have only been into cooking for a few months.

I started by chopping up a fairly large onion, a bit larger than  baseball, and frying it in vegetable oil. I added some garlic powder, pepper, salt, and tried to add a tiny bit of sugar... when i put WAY too much sugar, to the point that it melted into a liquidy soup.

I figured, ""fuck it,"" and added in about four eggs, with a little of the broccoli stalk i had remaining. I added a bit of hot pepper flakes for a zip and cooked it for about 10-15 min.

Now, I'm eating a golden-colored sweet mix of eggs that resembles the texture of oatmeal, and it's actually really good. If I mixed it with asian-style noodles, it seems like it could be a legit asian dish. It's sweet, has a little kick, and has a nice consistency.

Did I just discover new through my fuck-up, does it only taste good because I'm drunk, or does this kind of thing exist in the culinary world?",,False,,t5_2rgyt,False,,,True,t3_n3hen,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/n3hen/did_i_just_invent_a_new_dish/,

The other day on Oasis I was pinned down behind a rock on one side of the road, with a wounded teammate on the other side.  My health pack wouldn't reach so i threw it down and using my LMG shot it, and pushed it across the street to my teammate where he got healed.

TLDR; shooting health/ammo packs will push them.

Has anybody else noticed this yet?

Many you probably already know, but hopefully some you won’t.  If anyone wants to add me, I’m on PS3 as “vgsandrew”.  I play hardcore and normal, mainly rush, but like to get around to a little bit of everything.  Run all kits and styles, like to play coordinated but have fun, and only play with people that use mics.

General Tips:

Use the parachute at the very end of your fall.  Opening it a split second before you hit the ground will prevent any damage and you won’t be a floating duck for fire on the way down.  When dropping free fall from a chopper, many opponents will assume you’re just a dead body falling out and stop looking before you pull your chute.

When disarming an M-COM , if you pick up dropped kits accidently and reset the counter while sliding around to avoid sniper fire, do not let go of the button and start over.  Keep holding it down and you will still disarm in the normal amount of time even though the counter keeps resetting.

Mines stay on the ground even after you die and switch perks or kits, you can have up to 6 out at a time.  If you drop a 7th mine the 1st will disappear.  At the start of a match I will typically drop my 6 mines strategically and after my first death come back with rockets or as a different class.  Running around with mines the entire match is a waste of your load out.  Switch back when your first set have been used up, and then switch again.

Use your kits situationally.  Try not to become married to one class for an entire match.  Depending on the section of the map, enemy vehicles/kits/behavior, and your team and squadmate loadouts, assess the situation and come back as the class that will help your team the most on that section.

Remember every enemy you kill leaves free goodies for you, grab their kit and use them.  Toss a motion mine, heal yourself, get some more ammo, and then grab your kit back and hop back to it.  Even the best players forget to do this all the time.

If a medic on your team dies, grab his kit, and at the same time you hit the defib button, hit the kit swap button.  You will revive him and swap kits with each other at the same time, leaving both of you with your original loadout and very little time lost.

Using the knife is iffy no matter what, but against relatively stationary targets, you will have less fails if you duck before knifing.  Best for the sneak attacks from behind.

When spotting, do not mash the button as fast as possible.  You will quickly overload the button and enter a 5 second of so cool down where the button won’t work.  If instead you tap the spot button at a slow “one one-thousand” count while scanning the area, you can continue to spot indefinitely, quickly covering all important points.

In hardcore, the spot button is still useful for picking out bushed snipers or other hidden enemies.  Spot the area, and if your soldier calls out, you know there’s an enemy hidden directly in your line of site.  Hitting the start button to pull up the main map will also reveal their location, but it’s usually easier to find them visually.

If you started a squad with friends and then joined a game, your squad is auto set to “private”.  When in game, from the start menu go the squads section and turn it “public” if you want to fill out your squad but don’t have the friends.  Or, go to the scoreboard section and you can invite any players from your team or the other team into your squad.  This is great for when playing on your own on a bad team, try to find the few other competent players in the game, and then invite them to your squad.

Use grenades as a way to spot non visible enemies on the second floor or roof of buildings.  When tossed in their vicinity, they will call out and give away their position.  If you don’t get the kill, you will at least know where they are.

You can’t reload on the run, but you can run after you start to reload.

Medics can revive people through doors and walls as though the obstructions weren’t there.

The UAV is reparable.

This applies to almost all FPS, but I find because the sound design in BFBC2 is so amazing, this applies even more so:  Surround Sound speakers or headphones make a HUGE difference in all modes (I use the Triton 720s but Turtle Beach models are also very popular).  You will have full directional sense of all action around you.  If you’re on the second floor of a building, you’ll be able to hear an enemy crunching on the snow outside, if those steps are behind, to the side, or in front of you, and the shift to heels clacking on wood when he steps inside below you.  Once you get used to it, you will develop a spatial sense of the battlefield that goes far beyond your field of view.  And as an added bonus you will get knifed far, far less.

Due to the extreme nature of squad and teamwork in BFBC2, your fun is directly related to the quality and depth of your friends list of people that play BFBC2.  Anytime you run into a good teammate, add him.  Spend some time on the forums and etc meeting new people and adding them.  Grow your network with quality players as fast as possible.  The more you do this the less time you’ll spend banging your head against the wall on a crap team in a half empty game. 

Rush:

There is almost always a sniping or other angle to kill the UAV pilot on the first section of any Rush map, sometimes even by knife if you’re willing to run and out of bounds suicide.  If you can knife the pilot, that means you can also get on the UAV if it’s open.  Once on, the out of bounds timer will stop, and when the UAV blows up you will have a full 10 seconds to cause spawn mayhem or run back to safety.

On Rush defense often your best chance for winning is realizing when a set of M-COMs is a lost cause and setting up your defenses for the next section ahead of time.   This means strategic mine placement, deforestation, removal of cover, and/or staking out a good hiding place to commandeer one of the attacker's prized vehicles as soon as it spawns. If you want to get really nasty, drop mines on the spots where the enemy vehicles will spawn.  Choppers, tanks, etc. As soon as they hop in and try to move, boom.  This all slows down the enemy attack and gives you a chance to get your lines set up and dug in.

On offense, cover is almost always your friend, do not use blackhawks to knock down everything in site, you’re making things harder on your teammates.  On defense, the more you can knock down and open up the level, the harder you will make it on the attackers.  Blowing open non-destructible M-COM  buildings should almost always be a priority.  On sniper heavy maps, sometimes leaving up the lead wall will help with disarming without leaving corners for attackers to hide in once they’ve armed the M-COM.

On defense, always prioritize defending the non-destructible M-COM.  On offense, always leave destructible M-COMs until last.  You can take them out at any time with a variety of methods, but as soon as you do, the enemy now has their attention focused on the difficult M-COM instead of divided amongst two.  This applies to sets where one M-COM is much more difficult as well.  I’ve lost on attack on the last set of Nelson Bay to an inferior team many a time because my team took A first and then bled 60+ tickets trying to break the stronghold at B, when it would have been a walk in the park to take B first.

Snipers - don’t be a bush wookie, be a spawn wookie.  Especially in hardcore, the best place for a sniper on attack is on the side of or behind the defense’s spawn.  Most sections have advantageous and/or well hidden vantage points that defenders will rarely look at when sniped, as they expect you’re firing from the back of your base.  You will create a wonderful spawn point for your squad, try not to give it up by only killing the enemy when there is a tactical advantage (i.e. when the M-COM is armed, etc), and by only taking headshots so you don’t give up your position.  For the rest of the squad, if you run into the rare, rare, rare sniper who actually moves out of the back of his base, DO NOT spawn on him and immediately open fire, you will give up his position and your spawn point.  

Squad Deathmatch:

Because there are 4 squads, a multitude of kills is far more important than a minimum of deaths.  Every kill you get is worth one point for your squad, every death could go to one of three different squads.  Having a round of 25k 30d is far more valuable to your squad then a round of 4k 0d.  With this in mind, the single most important strategy in deathmatch is to constantly be in the middle of the action.  Camping usually leads to losing.  Engage the enemy as frequently as possible.

Take advantage of the revenge nature of players - once killed their first instinct will be to head right back to you to even the score.  Reset your position to watch over your old position and you can often take advantage of your opponent’s recklessness.

With a good squad, you can dictate the action of the map.  Set up close enough to each other to pick off each other’s kills if one of you loses a fire fight, but not so close that you are an easy double kill when someone gets the drop on you.  4 players firing in the same area will draw the enemy towards you, with your squad set in the best positions, and you will almost always have someone to spawn on in order to hold that section of the map.  If all 4 members of your squad are engaged in constant action through the round, you are very likely to win.

More than any other mode, a surround sound setup is key to deathmatch.  Because there are less vehicles, less players, less explosions, and less action, it is easier to pick up all environmental noise and figure out exactly where people are and what’s happening around you, at much further distances than in Rush or Conquest.

And I think that’s plenty for now ☺",,False,,t5_2rgyt,False,,,True,t3_ew2wq,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/ew2wq/a_whole_bunch_of_tips_and_tactics_from_me_brain/,

I feel like if we compiled a list it would be very helpful.

I'll start:

* When the MCOM station switches from the normal alarm sound to that high-pitched wailing noise, it means it is too late to disarm if you haven't already started

* If your helicopter has a tracer on it but you don't have VSMOKE selected, you can have an assault use a smoke grenade on your helicopter (even from inside if it is a blackhawk or hind) to remove it

* You can only repair helicopters from the inside if it is flying straight. If the pilot is maneuvering side to side or up and down, repairing won't work.

edit, thought of one more: A lot of people don't know this but the RPG and AT4 do more damage in exchange for the smaller blast radius. Against infantry and helicopters this doesn't really matter but against tanks they are far superior. Also, hitting the back of a tank &gt; hitting the sides &gt; hitting the front, in regards to damage. If you've got improved explosives on, two hits to the back of a tank will kill it.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,,,True,t3_i1mjl,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/i1mjl/what_are_some_of_the_littleknown_facts_of_bc2/,

If they are recon, great!  Toss out a motion mine and then switch back to your original kit.

If they are medic, toss out a health pack or revive some fallen teammates that were killed in the gunfight.

If they are assault, drop some ammo to replenish yourself or your teammates.

If they are engineers, see what they have.  Maybe a few AT mines for you to drop or an RPG/AT4 to blow that incoming tank.

Then just switch back to your kit.

Not only does this help yourself and your teammates immediately, but for you fellas looking to rank up this gives you bonus points.  Nothing like getting Heal, Ammo, and motion assist points while you are sporting the Engy kit.  One time that happened to me when I was engy.

This is actually a cut and paste from a post of mine about a year ago. But I just want to put this out there so the front page isnt filled with people who've put 5 hours into this game freaking out that their stats have disappeared.

So, without further ado:

A couple things are different, namely the orientation doesnt really match up 100% like the ""border crossing"" being south of town insted of north, but I'd say it's pretty close. Hit the terrain button and you'll see even that damned wookie hill exists in real life.

This one is kinda close. The real isla innocentes looks to be the first island north that they modeled the mp map. This one looks really close though.

Panama Canal:

Another one that's basically spot on.

The Atacama desert is a stretch of 400 miles in northern Chile. It's one of the driest places in the world. Googling for ""atacama shipwreck"" doesnt really yeild that much...the shipwreck is actually pretty charictaristic of Namibia, Africa which literally has hundreds of shipwrecks, many which you can see from google earth. Couldnt find any atacama shipwrecks by satellite though.

I have not been able to find White Pass, Nelson Bay, Laguna Presa or Laguna Alta. I had assumed LP and LA were in Chile, but I remember seeing some forum dude mention somewhere that they may be in venezuela.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,False,,,True,t3_forly,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/forly/many_of_the_maps_in_bad_company_2_are_based_off/,

* **Rule #1** - If it's a new round and there is a nice shiny new tank/truck/boat/helicopter...do not EVER drive off by yourself. If you see someone chasing after you when you first drive off from a spawn point, it's probably an engineer. YOU NEED THESE GUYS. We can help spot and repair you. We shoot the guns on the boats/trucks. In short, it's damn near idiotic to leave these guys behind. I know you're really excited to drive but doing so by yourself is just not cool.

* **Rule #2** - If you encounter heavy fire in front of you, BACK AWAY until you're out of range so the engineers can repair you. I saw nearly everyone driving tanks further in toward the firefight and die, causing everyone to respawn at our base. 

* **Rule #3** - If you're stopped and being repaired (you can tell because your vehicle's health miraculously starts going up) and you're not under fire, DO NOT DRIVE AWAY. Stay put until you're at or close to 100%.

* **Rule #4** - If you're in a smaller vehicle and someone is along for the ride, don't ditch the vehicle right in the middle of the firefight. The guy behind you can shoot in 270 degrees and it's much better to drive in semicircles around the enemy while your gunner shoots at a safe distance.

* **Rule #5** (some would argue this is rule #1) - If you don't know how to fly a helicopter, STOP. Stand next to it (assuming it's safe) and wait patiently. Someone will be there who can fly and you can have fun shooting people while the pilot circles around at a safe distance.

* **Rule #6** - If your engineer jumps out, he's probably got a really damn good reason. DO NOT EVER LEAVE HIM. He could be spotting for you, about to repair, or could see something you missed.

* **Rule #7** - If there's an enemy standing in front of you, he probably has a rocket launcher or C4. Back away and try to fire from a safe distance. Do not try to run them over. They can usually move out of your way and fire a rocket up your ass or plant some C4 and then it's game over for you. Of course, if they have their back to you, steamroll that shit.

* **Rule #8** - If there's a tank on a hill and you're in another vehicle, DO NOT DRIVE UP NEXT TO THEM. Look at the map. Maybe there's another point where you could do some complimentary damage to what the other guy's doing. Maybe attack from a completely different angle?

* **Rule #9** - If you're flying and are about to go outside the combat zone, do whatever you can to get back in. Do NOT jump out if there are others in there with you.

* **Rule #10** - Have fun! By no means do I want to come off as an ass or anything; if you follow these rules (nay, commandments) you really will have much more satisfying rounds.

Have any other handy tips for vehicles? Share them here.

* Edit - Obviously this comes from someone who plays engineer almost exclusively, but applies to others as anyone can hop in the passenger seat. It just helps the most when it's someone who can do repairs. :)",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,,,True,t3_ffu02,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/ffu02/if_youre_new_to_the_game_please_follow_some_basic/,

**Medic + Lightweight Pack + Body Armor.  Defibrilator paddles &amp; knife only. Small CQB conquest maps like Arica Harbor, Laguna Alta, Laguna Presa, and Oasis.**    

In full 32-person servers my friend and I were consistently placing in the top 4 on our team, usually topfragging and we even got ace pins a few times, just sprinting around defibbing bad guys together (giving a quick stab with the knife if the defib misses or you're waiting for the paddles to charge) and reviving teammates. 


Relevant: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFgR0m-9FmM  

We'd sprint into buildings together (usually with a good 10 feet separating us as to avoid being hosed down at the same time) and absolutely clean up, all the while saying things to each other like ""Being an assault? That's a paddlin.""  ""Taking point B? That's a paddlin.""  ""Camping in a corner? Ohhh you better believe that's a paddlin.""  

It's up there with the most fun I've ever had in this game.  Tears were shed.  We died plenty of times simply because we were laughing to hard to keep our hands on the keyboard, and the entertainment factor only got better when people on the other team raged at our defib shenanigans.

Now there was two of us in the water and we were face to face. I panicked and pressed my middle mouse button to knife. Nothing happened. We both looked RIGHT at each other and stopped for a couple seconds in awkward silence. Both of us came to the realization. We were in water, and therefore we would not be able to use weapons. So the first one to shore would come out alive. We both raced to shore and alas, I reached it first. Then I shot him in the face with my M1. The end.

We're defending on Atacama desert (one of my favorite maps, it plays to DICE's vehicle strengths)

Anyways, I'm tired of them suicide-ATVing the objective, so I placed a antitank mine pretty far in front of the building containing the MCOM.  Sure enough, pretty soon some kid cruises down on a quad covered in C4, planning to suicide the objective, hits my mine, the quad catapults into the building and explodes, which collapses the building.  

Since my mine set off his C4 which set off the destruction 2.0, I got -250 for destroying the station, and negative points for half my team dying when the building collapsed on them.

I couldn't even get angry about it, because it was SO COOL.  These types of moments are why I play Battlefield.  The hallmark of the Battlefield series is these user-created moments, which could be the finale cinematic set-piece of other games.  

When you're running up a hill and a plane buzzes inches from your face, shooting out from the other side of the hill, skimming the grass.  

When a tank shoots a helicopter out of the air that was trying to roadkill you, and it flips forward over your head and crashes into the building behind you.  

And yes, when a quad bike hits a mine, flies through the air and collapses a building and wins the round, giving some poor schmuck on the other team -500 points.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,,360,True,t3_dy99j,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/dy99j/500_points_in_5_seconds_or_why_i_play_battlefield/,

It's a good enough game,  I'm sure I'll get many,  many hours out of it.   However,  they clearly want to compete more with the COD's and the MW2's of the world.  Again,  that's fine,  it's still a fun game.  Yes, BF3 has jets,  which is great,  but rarely has that changed the outcome of any game so far. 

That being said,  the *core* gameplay in BC2 is still above and beyond (IMO) anything out there for several reasons:


-  The destructible environments in BC2 are far more of a focus.  In BF3, any sort of collapsible buildings are for show at best.   I miss the ""DESTRUCTION 2.0"" messages (Operation metro lacks any destructible environments whatsoever).  Again,  this was a trade off for processing power for larger maps.   I would have taken the BC2 route personally.

- The motion mines were a thing of genius.  The TUGS just doesn't compare.  Motion mines allowed you to interact with team mates half way across the map.  It encouraged team play unlike anything else I had ever seen.

- While BC2 has fewer models of tanks / jeeps etc,  you could actually use them for more than a minute.  The one shot RPG kill makes the BF3 tanks virtually useless.  I think this was a move to encourage person v person combat.  The MW2 mantra is to bump up kill counts so that you'll become more addicted to the game.  If a person sits in a tank half the round, the game itself is less addictive (that's not a conspiracy theory, it's well known that developers consider these things). 


- BC2 maps were just right given the 360 player limitations.  If a few people drop out,  defenders are screwed pretty quickly.     The BC2 maps were amazing all around.  I think some of the Bf3 maps are frankly too massive, and more suited to the PC's player counts.


Again,  I don't want to piss on BF3 too much,   I just think that BC2 still holds its own 100 percent.   If there were mod tools for it,  I'd be playing for the next 10 years - and I'm sure that's why they don't release such things anymore.

1307376052.0,87,self.badcompany2,hsxcf,The real deal about shotguns.,djork,102,15,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/hsxcf/the_real_deal_about_shotguns/,"There was a good deal of misinformation in the ""shotgun advice"" thread. So, without further ado, here is:

**THE REAL DEAL ABOUT SHOTGUNS**

No bullshit. Just facts and figures. Read this and you will know all about shotguns. You should be able to use this info to inform your tactics.

**BUCKSHOT**

For *all shotguns* each pellet does 14.3 damage up to 8m, dropping to 6.0 at 18m.

This means you need 7 pellets in the body to kill up close. Spread and low damage makes kills at long range quite hard.

Pumps shoot 12 pellets, and autos shoot 6.

Magnum ammo increases damage by 1.25x, and increases the range for max damage. With magnum ammo you only need 6 pellets to the body to kill, making autos a one-shot kill at close range (although you need to be more accurate than with a pump... but ROF helps to compensate).

Headshots add a further damage multiplier of 2.5x. This means 3 pellets in the head will kill at close range. That's how you can clear a room with an auto shotgun...

**SLUGS w/ PUMP**

Slugs rock. They give a shotgun the same damage profile as a bolt-action rifle.

100 damage up to 10m, dropping to 50 at 36m. Headshots do 3.25x damage.

That's a one-shot kill at close range, one-shot headshot kill at any range.

Pump + slugs = embarrassment cannon.

Magnum ammo **doubles** the effective one-shot kill range to 20m, but you will need two shots (or preferably a sidearm or teammate) to finish someone off after a body hit at range.

**SLUGS w/ AUTO**

SAT analogy time, guys: pump shotgun is to bolt-action sniper rifle as semi-auto shotgun is to _____.

(answer: semi-auto sniper rifle)

39 damage up to 8m, dropping to 28 damage at 64m. Headshots do 2.1x damage.

This is a bit trickier to work with. Headshots are never one-shot kills, except at close range with magnum ammo (or in hardcore), and there are lots of guns that will kill faster. I don't recommend this combo even if it sounds cool.

**40mm**

The 40mm assault shotgun is really, really handy. It's also completely different from pumps or autos and is actually quite simple (and deadly as a result).

It shoots 12 pellets, doing 16.7 damage each (2.5x headshot damage) at **all ranges**. This means that it can take out people further away than a normal shotgun. Aim for the torso, and you'll pretty much always take someone down out to short-medium range. On hardcore it is a truly surprising death-dealing machine requiring only 4 body hits or 2 head hits (most likely some combination, though) to kill **at any range**.

**THE BEST SHOTGUN**

The NS2000 is the best pump shotgun, *stats-wise*, with fairly fast reload times. BunsinHoneyDew notes that the 870 takes up less screen space, giving you potentially more visibility than the others.

The SPAS has the slowest reload of the pumps. It sucks. There is no way in which the SPAS is better than the 870.

The USAS has a slightly better plain reload time than the SAIGA, but the SAIGA can use the reload swap trick to reload slightly faster than the USAS.

Otherwise, all shotguns are identical within their respective class for other stats.

**MORE NOTES ON HARDCORE**

Hardcore means players have 60 health. Weapon damage remains the same. Two pellets in the head or five in the body will kill up close. This means *autos can one-shot kill without magnum ammo*, freeing up a slot if you think that's already deadly enough.

Pump shotguns with slugs and magnum ammo will kill with one hit at any range with any shot placement. Autos with slugs and magnum ammo will kill with one headshot or two body shots at any range. This is a bit of a different dynamic than in non-hardcore, making auto + slugs + magnum more appealing.

Auto + slugs (no magnum) kills with two shots up close, or with one headshot up close, but NOT with a single headshot at range, making it not quite as useful.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,,ps3,True,t3_hsxcf,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/hsxcf/the_real_deal_about_shotguns/,

Important things from article:

* when there's an explosion near you, your soldier is projected to the ground, and it apparetnly isn't scripted. when you get too much shots your soldier starts closing and opening his eyes(?) from the pain, and your visibility gets bad.
* the maps should be very varied(new york, paris, nocturn, desert, etc)
* frostibite 2.0 has been in devellopment since 2008. ""PC Jeux"" got surprised by the engine, it's kind of revolutionary, like the first engine from Crysis was back in 2007.

I hope we can compile a list here of people who want to play in a squad and are willing to give/take orders.  

If you want, leave a comment with your platform, handle, kit preference(s), and if you'd like to be a leader or a grunt.  I'd encourage anyone who wishes to be a squad leader [to link to their stats](http://bfbc2.elxx.net/sigg-o-matic.php) so people can evaluate your gameplay style before joining your squad (percent of points from team/squad scores are good to look at when picking teammates).

**EDIT**: At the suggestion of defree, if you include **region/time zone** and **gaming hours**, I will list it with your other info.  I will also include if you are a good pilot or vehicle driver if you wish.  I can also include notes about your play style.

* Each base has a UAV for the attackers. As much fun as it is to shoot the UAV's machine gun at people, you really want to go with either the upgraded damage or reload. The UAV is extremely useful when it comes to dropping buildings from afar, while spotting enemies around the other M-Com.
* You can eventually whittle away at an M-Com with grenades, 40mm grenades, mortar strikes or rockets. But nothing works as well as C4. A recon with upgraded explosives and extra C4 can do it in two runs. Toss the motion mine near the M-Com, sneak around without killing anyone and hit it. You can also swap your assault rifle for a shotgun, Thompson, M14 or G3 to get C4 to go with your ammo box, which is a nice combo. It will take longer to get the crate and you won't have a motion mine covering your ass, so beware.
* It's really not worth arming an M-Com if you can drop a building on it. The only time I arm an M-Com in a destructible building is right before I drop the building on it, for some easy Destruction 2.0 kills.
* I've read that buildings have an overall HP counter, but the simple rule is that you want to take out all the walls downstairs and two upstairs. Use C4, rockets or 40mm grenades. 
* Speaking of 40mm grenades, you can knock out walls without an explosion by being right up on it. It's especially useful if you want to hide inside a building while taking it down.
* Mortar strikes are good against buildings, but that'll take forever if you work alone. Chances are that you'll end up losing the round before you can drop a building with mortar strikes.


**Nelson Bay**

At the first base, you definitely want to get A first. You can drop B easily. (The upgraded damage perk for the UAV can take down the B building with four rockets, one on each side of the building.) I highly recommend C4ing A while everyone is guarding B, as it seems B is always the one that gets covered. You can drop A, but it's a bitch compared to B.

At the second base, get A first (again). You can't drop that trailer and again, most people tend to defend B. However, you can keep using that UAV to drop B with help from people shooting grenades at the ""front side,"" while hiding by the downed helicopter. (When defending this point, make sure to take out the bridges by A on the frozen river.) Again, I recommend C4 for A. Drop B. 

At the third base, it's a toss up. B can turn into a total shit-show, whereas A is only a crowded little shack. You can't drop either and A is harder to defend. I prefer to take A first, smoking the room while a recon goes to town on the M-Com. Sneak around to B and put a hole in the wall by the M-Com. Most people only guard the doorways. Stay to the ""front side"" of B, since a lot of snipers like to sit on the back side in the two-story green trailer.



**Arica Harbor**

As cheap as it may be, no point in any Rush map is easier to take than A at the first base. Put on your upgraded optics and drop A from afar. If you leave the tank near the spawn, shoot out the green road sign. That's roughly the angle you need to aim at to take out the front walls. 
Always take B first. Always. I hate Arica on Rush, especially since it can be an all-around bitch, depending on how your team is doing. If you can, try to coordinate a tank attack on the front of the base while two recons on the ATV sneak around and take B. Drop A at your leisure once you finish B. (And take out the sniper towers ASAP.)

Second base, you want to go with A first, as per usual. Like on Nelson Bay, you can drop B quickly with the UAV. Have the UAV pilot (or a tank) open the shutters for you, so you don't have to stand there in the road. 

Third point, I prefer to take B first. You can use your tank to attack A, since you can fire right into the bus. B is a recon's wet dream, as you can sneak around under the bridge, come up behind the point and C4 the hell out of the M-Com with minimal resistance. Go wide around the right side, run to the bridge and get there early. Have a squad mate chill down under the bridge as a mobile spawn point and get to it. 

Fourth point, go wide around the right or left side (you can swim in the water and use the ladders to get up). At this point, smoke is your friend. I like to take A first, but the benefit to taking B first is that you have less distance to travel and you can get people to cover you from the train cars. 

Final point, either or. It's going to be a total shit-show no matter how you do it. 



**Valparaiso**

First point, take A first. Sneak down the left side in the jungle, hide behind the sniper tower and take down A before your idiot teammates in the Blackhawk destroy all the cover. The light tank can roll up on B and take it out with help from those sneaking up from the beach. You can also get the heli to drop you off behind or on top of the far garage behind A. Works well if you need a squadmate to hang back for you to spawn off of. 

Second point, take A first (again). I highly recommend getting guys up near the lighthouse immediately to take focus off the front. That way the foot infantry or the light tank can hit A quickly. Once A is down, a push from the lighthouse and whoever is left at A can get B easily. For extra help, get someone to hop on the stationary AT and fire at B. 

Third point, always hit A first. Always. It is so much harder to get into that mess of an area once the whole team is only guarding that point. B is much easier once you realize you can swim under the house and plant C4 UNDERNEATH the M-Com station to blow it up. (When defending, you need to have someone covering the water at all times.) Have the heli drop you into the water on the far side near the next base, then swim back to avoid anyone watching the front.

Fourth point, smoke and motion mines. Put someone in your squad next to A on the cliff, so you can get someone to cover you (and to spawn off). It's actually ideal to take both at the same time, but it's always ideal to do that, so go A first. You can hide behind (or in) the sniper town at B and do it piecemeal. 

Final point, ignore B totally. Go for A. You can swing the stationary AT around and take out B in four-five rockets. Smoke and speed are your friends.



**Port Valdez**

You should know this by now, but here's some tips anyway.

The second easiest M-Com in the game is the first point's A M-Com. You can actually ram the house down with the tank. (Easy defense is to throw down mines in the forest behind A, but so few people do it.) While I prefer to leave A and get B first, you might as well get A quickly, leaving the whole team to focus on B. A is so fragile; it almost doesn't matter. With B, use the light tank to cover the concrete three-story behind the hole and smoke the area. You can actually ram a few ATVs with C4 on them into B, but you knew that already.

The second point, it almost doesn't matter. I prefer A. You just have to drop both buildings. Easy.

The third point, you can't drop either. A has less cover, so go A first. You can smack it to death with the stationary AT behind it, but it takes 5-6 rockets. C4 and smoke might be better, so you don't get sniped from the concrete building behind you. As for B, wait for a lull in the Apache fire and drive the party bus into B. (No, seriously. Just dodge the blocks in the road and it's easy.) You can use the gun on the bus to cover the back door of B and the rest of the squad can use the bus to hop up on top of the containers. The only things to fear here are the Apache and land mines. 

The fourth point, you need to take A first. Say it with me: *you need to take A first.* A can be a total bitch to take once you get B since it compresses the entire defending team into that small space. Sneak up in the woods, the long way around, and get up to the helipad. Have someone hang out around the stationary AT building as a mobile spawn point. Take A with C4. B, you can literally take from the roof. There's a skylight window overlooking the M-Com and you can kill it with rockets/grenades easily. Have three people spamming ordinance down and the fourth watching the stairs/ladder.

So here I'll try and explain best I can, the controls, because the game doesn't do it for you.

Here's the easy stuff:

* W - increases altitude
* S - decreases altitude
* A - turns helicopter left
* D - turns helicopter right

Now on to the mouse controls which are probably where people are totally having their minds blown.

Roll - this is movement of the helicopter to the left or right, think strafing, and is controlled by moving the mouse in the correlating direction, (to swing left; move the mouse left).

Pitch - This tilts the helicopter forward or backwards.  Move the mouse forward to lean the nose forward essentially propelling the helicopter forward, and then you can tilt it back to move backwards.

Now the key to mouse movement is self control.  You don't want to make HUGE tilts in any direction; it'll just cause the choppa to crash into the ground.  Another big thing is that for every movement you make you need to have a counter movement to stop. So when you are strafing left and you're ready to stop you want to not just reset the mouse to the starting position, you want to swing to the right a little. Same goes for moving forwards and backwards. 

Now you're not going to be able to pilot the Apache and the Havoc like some kind of pro right off the bat, but you should be able to competently pilot a blackhawk so that your mates can gun from it and in turn rack you up some vehicle assists. 

Some other blackhawk piloting tips...
 
* Use **V** **smoke**!!! There are no weapons as a pilot and it really makes you a nuisance to people when they can't plant a dart on your choppa. (If you're a gunner use **V** **warhead**! It's good for any vehicle or mounted gun!)

* Dodging rockets really isn't too hard, for the most part increasing and decreasing altitude will do you just fine.  However strafing to the left and right work wonders and in combination with altitude changes certainly doesn't hurt.  All in all just keep your movement in the choppa irregular.

* Choppers can be repaired midair! (at least the blackhawk and the Hind can) Engineers that are passengers on these two kinds of helicopters can whip out the repair tools and aim them at the ceiling or floor of the helicopter and repair it! Thing is though you have to have the helicopter generally level, not tilted forward/backwards or to either side!!!

* If you decide to be a dedicated engineer in a helicopter then equip **V** **armor**! A Helicopter will be able to sustain a rocket hit if someone has it equipped that's riding along (It will take a helicopter from 100 to 7 armor; according Daminox)! This gives the engineer riding along a chance to rack up some extra points.

We were on the attacking team. A full game of 12 v. 12. The entire team parachuted in and began our initial assault of the village. 

My entire squad and another squad flanked the right, two Assault on our team flanked from the left. After a massive shootout the first line of defense was taken out and we began our attack on the MCom stations. 

I look up at a house near one of the MCom Stations and see a guy shooting into the street. I don't think he hit his target, but he let me know exactly where he was. I flip the switch on my gun, let a grenade fly into the wall hiding him, and then unload a clip into the smokey debris taking him and a sniper out. Good fun. 

I ducked behind some trees to reload my weapons and throw out an ammo box. While reloading I look at two houses near where I was hiding. With only a small alley separating them, a massive battle began between the two houses. It seemed a large portion of my team and the other team had holed up in the two houses, and then all hell broke loose. What I saw was eerily beautiful.  Rockets from both houses shot out across the alley, volleys of bullets peppered the windows. Grenades flew from one window into the other. People were shooting from both floors. No one was safe, and everyone was unloading clips with no pause. 

In those few seconds of reloading my grenade and ammo the two house became piles of rubble. The sounds were amazing, and just watching the battle play out in front of me, watching the rockets shoot from one house into the other was so badass.

The chopper had 2 recon's in it, the entire hill across from the MCOMS and the Islands had snipers on them.  We couldn't spawn without getting sniped, there was constant mortar fire, every building collapsed.  


The thing is they never attacked, they were happy to just pick us off and farm points, after a long and boring slow decline of tickets, we were sniper hunting on the hill too far from the mcoms. We really didn't see a choice, finally one guy sneaks up and destroys the last MCOM.  We're ready to quit, it was boring as shit, no firefights, just trying to breakout to do some killing of our own.


This continues on the second set of points, when my squadmate says ""Lets use smoke"" so we did, 4 of us spawned as assault and kept a wall of smoke across the entire field of view.  The snipers couldn't see us.  All we had to contend with was random mortar fire.



Suddenly we were at a stalemate, their tickets must have stayed at 34 for 5 mins.


This is when it happened, the points-whores were getting bored, stareing at smoke. 


They decided to attack.


What I didn't say was that we weren't smoking our feet we were smoking the perimeter. We had a good 20-30 yards of clear air between us and the smoke.  The snipers would run through the smoke expecting low visibility right up to the mcom, what they got was 8 pissed off assault kits waiting for a fight.  Now my squad was competing to be the first one to shoot the dumbasses running into our base.  It was beautiful.

Suffice it to say that I tried really, *really* hard to like this game but it's just not happening. 

But if I have to distill it to one thing it has to be the gun play, or lack thereof. Everyone just sprays and prays (save for very long distances after the Dec 6/13 patch). The recoil is ridiculous--the answer to that in the past was to burst or pop fire, but it seems that in BF3 they punish you for not going full auto. The whole game feels COD-ified to me. The only people I know who really enjoy the game are people who played BF2, I never did. I started with BFBC2 and I can honestly say I have more fun playing COD than I do BF3, heresy I know. 

Anyway, long story short I came back to BC2 and I began having fun again, I remembered why I played video games to begin with. 

Is anyone else fed up with BF3? And what was the last straw for you?

**edit**
I feel like most people are in denial about how disappointing BF3 is. It may be because we had such high and unrealistic expectations, exacerbated by hype and how fantastic previous iterations were. Or it could be that many of you spent a lot of money, (underline *a lot*) for a new rig just for this game and cant admit that it is a huge disappointment. The game was rushed, plain and simple. Furthermore it was tweaked to attract a new demographic that previously steered clear from BF titles in the past. What transpired was a mess of a game that seems to have a cap on how fun it can be. Patches can and have fixed many issues, but a lot of it are not going to be patched.  For what its worth the vast majority of YT commentators also agree to some degree, [here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_De0BOeqCUQ&amp;feature=g-user-u) 
Anyway all Im trying to say that despite all the great things BF3 has to offer, which are indeed very impressive and groundbreaking, the developers failed in recapturing the fun BFBC2 had.

1. Accidentally learned to fly. I don't know if I'm fucking Ace McCloud or maybe the fucking Red Baron in another life, but it just ""clicked"" and, while I still have a lot to learn, it's fun as hell.
2. Bailed off of an ATV after seeing an enemy directly ahead of me, and when I decided to shoot it with my grenade launcher exploded and killed three people (amazing moment. I felt like fucking Rambo.)
3. Learned that I love being an engineer after shooting down my first helicopter with a rocket launcher and having it crash like 15 feet in front of me, and the cacophony of noise and destruction that ensued. I was fucking hooked.
4. Parachuted behind enemy lines conveniently right behind four enemies and was able to knife two of them and shoot the other two (another fucking Rambo moment.)

Seriously, this game is fucking amazing, and I know I'm just gushing right now, and you all already know this. 

I just want to say THANK YOU Steam for putting it on sale. I will definitely be buying the next one as soon as it's released. My experience with the online community has been really positive too, which is surprising for a FPS imo.

Anyway, cheers... :D See you all on the reddit servers.

If anyone wants to add me, I’m on PS3 as “vgsandrew”. I play hardcore and normal, mainly rush, but like to get around to a little bit of everything. Run all kits and styles, like to play coordinated but have fun, and only play with people that use mics.

Gadgets:

If you learn to time it properly, you can toss C4, mines, grenades, motions mines, etc. far further than normal by jumping while in the middle of the toss.  For health/ammo packs, you want to jump first, then toss. For max distance, look up at a 45 degree angle while pushing forward.  This especially useful with C4, basically turning it into a sticky grenade with tons of new uses, like taking out 2nd story stair/building campers by tossing bricks up from the outside and detonating.

Mines have a set time of a few seconds after being dropped, and need to be placed a few feet away from a stationary vehicle to be set off when that vehicle goes in motion.  Placing them directly next to or under won’t work unless the vehicle moves and then moves again back into them.  They are best placed in concealed areas, ie shadows, craters and water.  Depending on the vehicle and armor, how dead on the vehicle hits the mine, and if you have the explosive perk running either one or two will do the job. Be mindful of the blast radius, if you place mines too close they will create a chain reaction, blowing up all of your mines and/or teammates mines when you could have had the next set waiting for another vehicle.

Many players recognize the C4 noise when placed on their tanks and will hop out as soon as you place it.  A stealthy alternative against stationary tanks is to drop two mines and then toss a grenade onto them.  Or, hold down circle while placing C4 next to the tank and hop in to steal it as soon as they hop out.

C4 can be used extremely effectively as a large mine trap against moving vehicles.  Place your sticks on a commonly used road, watch for a vehicle moving down it, and time your detonation.

Defibs open doors and cut down fences just like a knife.  Medics can use this tactic when sneaking behind enemy lines.  Many players are conditioned to listen for the sound of a knife thrust or gun fire but won’t give a second thought to the sound of a defib even right next to them.

Pay attention to motion sensor as you toss them ahead of you, they will pick up any movement while still in the air, giving you a wider range of coverage than their final resting spot.

If you hear a motion sensor beeping but don’t see one on your map, you’re in an enemy’s sensor.  Seems obvious but a lot of people don’t realize motion mines only work when you’re in motion, if you don’t move or creep along at a very slow speed they won’t go off even when you’re right in the middle of their radius. 

In normal mode, if you’re not sure whether a mine is friendly or enemy, place your cross hairs over it.  If they disappear, it’s a friendly mine, if they remain, it’s an enemy mine.

Vehicles:

Tanks are extremely powerful when used effectively but all too often players rush in with them as though they are indestructible killing machines.  Tanks are usually most effective when used from medium range, close enough to use their firepower to effect the frontline action, but far enough that they keep the bulk of the enemy in front of them rather than at all sides.  This reduces the enemy focus on your tank, gives you the ability to duck back behind cover, and allows time to repair damage from rockets.

If you’re by yourself in a tank, switching to the gunner seat will turn the engine off and give the impression that it is not in use unless you are spotted or an enemy places their cross hairs over you from a close distance.  This can be especially effective when you leave the tank in its original spawn point, and is particularly useful in deathmatch.  Since the machine gun swivels much faster than the main, and most players will try to C4 the tank to destroy it, you can usually get a few stealth kills followed by a few C4 revenge kills by constantly scanning the approach points to the tank before being taken out.

The warhead vehicle perk is extremely effective for gunners in air vehicles, especially the Blackhawk.  It seems to be far more of a boost than equipping magnum ammo on guns.  My friends tell me all the time that they can’t gun anyone down in the Blackhawk, and as soon as I have them equip warheads, they’re mowing the opposition down like crazy.

Burning tanks are the best hiding spot in the game, you’re very difficult to see and most players never think to take a hard look. Jump up the front to hop on and stay on the hood rather than all the way up top for maximum stealth.

All vehicles except the UAV have a third person viewing option (press up on the dpad on PS3), which is useful in certain situations depending on the vehicle.  I fly Blackhawks exclusively in third person, as they’re much easier to control and you can see tracer darts immediately.  Quad bikes, water vehicles and Hummers allow for a better viewing angle when driving.  Tanks make it easier to see C4 bombers creeping up on you. etc.  On PS3, the extra analog pad can be used to swivel the camera around your vehicle, which for example can be useful to look for snipers while passing an island on a jet ski.

Choppers have a wider out of bounds area than infantry on most maps, use this to your advantage by landing to repair in the infantry out of bounds.  You can hop out, use your full repair time and hop back in before the infantry out of bounds timer runs out, often hidden from the enemy line of site and fire.

Transport vehicles are basically tinfoil deathtraps for mines, tanks, rockets, small arms fire, etc for all people riding in them.  While it’s human nature to want to get into the action as soon as possible and spawn onto your teammate for the joy ride, it’s far more effective to watch him reach the destination and then spawn.  On my more coordinated squads at the start of a rush attack game, we’ll designate one person to spawn in and drive their vehicle up to the objective ASAP, and have everyone spawn on him once he gets there.  Also helps prevent people getting stuck on foot on maps like Arica Harbor when all the vehicles get nabbed by lone wolfs.

When you steal an enemy vehicle, they won’t get that vehicle in their respawn until it is destroyed.  This can be an extremely effective strategy on certain levels of Rush defense with tanks.   Defend and repair them with great focus, as you get the double benefit of added firepower and depriving the attackers of their own.

When attempting a road kill with the quad bike, you need to hit the enemy with your tires.  If you hit them dead center with the bike itself the hit won’t register.

Deathmatch:

When playing normal mode squad deathmatch, be careful with spotting, as the spotted player shows up for your opponents as well as your squadmates.  You will often end up aiding kills for other squads unless you spot situationally.

Medics reviving in deathmatch do not take a kill away from the other team and does not help your ticket count.  I’ve often seen a player killed, medic runs into the open to do a rambo revive, gets killed in the process, and his squad mate gets killed again before he has a chance to react.  3 quick tickets for the opposing team.  But for special situations, I find it’s usually better to take the respawn time and come back situationally aware with a full clip.

Random:

I use FPS Freek analog thumb extenders; they basically raise the analog stick so you have a wider range of motion, allowing you to turn your sensitivity up for quick movement while maintaining precision control.  Not a huge difference like using a keyboard/mouse, but a definite plus and I got used to them after only a couple hours of playing. They’re cheap, something like $10 for a pair, and you only need one per controller as the left analog stick doesn’t really need any help.

Most weapons reload long before the reload animations finish.  You can cut down reload times by quick switching to your pistol and back by double pressing the button as soon as you see the ammo count reset.  Eventually this timing will become second nature.  You can also use this method to cancel a reload if you still have bullets in the chamber and suddenly find yourself under duress.

You can get through large windows by jumping towards the windowsill and then crouching to hop through.  Especially useful when both doors are still up so you can give the appearance the building is unoccupied.

The default language for Russian forces is Russian, but you can change this to English with Russian accents in the sounds section of the options menu.  Definitely useful for understanding the shouts and commands in game.

If you are the only player on a squad with a mic, avoid the tendency to turn it off.  Players without mics will still often still listen and respond to info and commands.  I’ve even had full squads flip their mics on after I started jabbering, not using theirs because everyone else was silent and they assumed no one had a mic.

When sniping long distances, hold the fire button down after your shot to remain zoomed in and watch where the bullet lands.  This will allow you to adjust for bullet drop, speed against moving targets, etc. and line up additional shots.  Eventually your sense of placement will become second nature, but this eliminates much of the guesswork early on.

In Rush, hold circle on PS3 (or whatever disarm button) while running up to an M-Com to start arming/disarming as quick as possible and eliminate the glitch where you pick up a kit instead of starting to disarm.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,False,,,True,t3_fn1dz,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/fn1dz/tips_and_tactics_from_me_brain_part_2/,

1300047945.0,60,self.badcompany2,g39e5,This civil war needs to end.,LordSparkles,83,23,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/g39e5/this_civil_war_needs_to_end/,"Right now there seems to be a huge conflict between the mumble club and the general r/bc2 community. As somebody who can't seem to get mumble to work with his headphones, I personally can't even request a VIP slot. I've also heard some pretty mixed things about the mumble server from friends (slows down game, everybody is just shouting memes, doesn't really have anything to do with teamwork).

Based on the general unwillingness to go through the mumble process on the part of many and general opposition to the current system I have three propositions:

1. Erase the VIP system. It only creates controversy and although some are saying the queue would put them off from playing the server, there is clearly an interest as other people (myself included) are still willing to wait and the server is never more than 1/4 VIPs.

2. Someone just creates a new server. Fairly self-explanatory but given the sheer height of some people's horses regarding their VIP status removing the current format may anger some. This could be avoided by creating a new server, though it may split the community.

3. Use reddit for the VIP process. Why not use the current messaging system or even a subreddit for requesting VIP status. It's a medium we are all familiar with and perfectly streamlines the process as we don't have to download unfamiliar software and learn to use it/not be able to use it. I would be perfectly happy to start running a subreddit where people can simply list their name and request a VIP status that could be available to us all. This may also be a bit of a stretch but why not just grant VIP to anyone that has used the in-game name and platform type that this subreddt currently uses and automatically adds anybody else who goes through that process. Again, it is simple and easy and is a medium we all know.

TL;DR I like to eat cheese sandwiches with my pet flamingo on Monday.

EDIT: I'm seeing a lot of people saying we don't need mumble for VIP. If so, why is it not more commonly used and why is it not more widely known. If it is actually efficient I don't see why the whole community can't just use this process.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,,,True,t3_g39e5,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/g39e5/this_civil_war_needs_to_end/,

I don't normally share stories that are about playing any games, but I have to tell you guys about this.

It's Oasis rush, i'm on defense. We are getting hammered, they are about to take the 2nd set of mcoms. I see that we are about to be forced to fall back, so I spawn with extra AT mines. I am running through the vineyard dropping AT mines in strategic spots as I usually do on defense, and as soon as I run out I fall back to the 3rd set of mcoms. 

At this point you could probably care less, but keep reading. I get up onto the roof of first house looking towards the base we just lost, and man the stationary nade launcher. I notice 3 tanks waiting to charge, so I lob a few rounds towards them. As soon as they noticed me they started to charge across the vineyard field, all 3 of them. FUCKING BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM, all 3 simultaneously blow up, getting 6 kills and destroying 3 vehicles within 2 seconds of each other. This was followed by 10 or so enemy infantry units also charging into the wetlands, and I open fire with the nade launcher taking out countless infantry along with the tanks. All of this happening in under a minute.

I don't think this will ever happen again, and even if you wanted to recreate it it would never be as crazy as it was in real time.

I was literally scream laughing like a little kid, i'm a level 34 and had yet to experience something so jaw dropping.

* Will the maps have similar gameplay features as in BC1 (MEC, Artillery)?

Unfortunately they will not. The maps have been made with the idea and vision of Bad Company 2. The maps have been suited to fit the vision, gameplay and scope of Bad Company 2.


* Do you have a release date ready for us?

I do not have a release date for you yet. I'm however working on to get a release date out for you guys. The whole idea of Map Pack 7 was to announce that ""Hey guys, we are working on this"". This does not necessarily mean that we will give an ETA, but we will post an ETA when we are 100% sure of a date.


* Why not Cold war CQ and Heavy Metal Rush?

The specific thought was to make Conquest even more vehicle packed than Atacama Desert with an emphasis on brutal clashes between tanks. With four helicopters in the sky and 8 tanks on the ground, we wanted to bring vehicular warfare to a completely new level in BC2.

Heavy Metal Rush didn't really fit into our vision, the same as Cold War CQ.


* Why did you choose Oasis and Harvest Day? There were plenty of other maps to choose from!

We decided to go with these after taking a look at the Facebook poll posted some months ago. We also listened to a lot of voices from the Community specifically wanting Oasis and Harvest Day. The maps also differ quite well from eachother.

The maps are going to be as you remember them from BC1. Wether there are bottlenecks or not is what I have experienced from my years as a gamer, very individual.

We have polished the maps, improved the lighting and applied BC2-graphics to the different maps. We haven't changed the whole concept of the map so to say.

* Are these maps aimed for 2011 or 2010 as long as problems are worked out?  Not asking for a specific date...just if they were meant for 2010 or 2011 under the original plan.

I can't comment on that question, even if you're not asking for a specific date. Seeing it as I don't want to start any speculations and rumors.

Against these demon-worshipping capitalists is pitted a ragtag band of ecological warriors from Greenpeace.  The job of the Greenpeace warriors is to sacrifice a number of Love Bricks(tm) on the MCOM altars in order to convert the heathens to treehugging environmentalists.

Keep an eye on your health when you're in a tank; if it goes up, you're being repaired, and an engineer on foot CANNOT keep up with you if you drive away.

Listen; the only reason to drive away is if it will save your life immediately. Otherwise, let me fix you. I don't care how good your evasive maneuvers are; a pair of engineers are better at keeping you alive unless by driving away you *completely* break line-of-site to *everything* that's hitting you.

This advice is especially relevant on Arica Harbor where each team gets roughly a metric fuckload of vehicles and the team that manages them better wins *every time*.

Thanks!

It seems like:

1.  Nobody uses the built in VOIP.  I think I've heard one person in 40 hours of playing, and they just made random muffled accidental mic triggering noises; or they were wearing a bondage hood.

2.  The 'chat' options are terrible.  You can't chat when you're dead, which would be the best time to do it.  And for some reason, if you hit the chat key, there's a brief but perceptible period during which the next character you type is just dropped on the floor.  And you don't get to type much.  And the chat stays on your screen only very briefly.

3.  In fact, you can't VOIP when you're dead either.  Nor can you tell when you're transmitting.  So you just have to guess that your levels are OK and that people can hear you, because as mentioned before you can't talk back.

4.  Other battlefield games (back in the dusty recollections of my history) at least let you give text commands (e.g. 'medic!') so that people around you could react to what's happening.  In this game, your character yells like an idiot whenever anything happens, but it's rarely, very rarely, appropriate (e.g., you're behind enemy lines, alone, you drop an ammo box, and you yell 'LOL THERE IS AN AMMO BOX HERE EVERYONE LOL' in your thick middle eastern accent, and 9 enemy medics with M60s show up to enjoy a spot of rape).

5.  Much of the appeal of the game is that teamwork is really useful, but yet there's no apparent way to queue together for a game.  WoW has dedicated servers, but something like their battleground/arena queue system, where you have a chance to organize and form a team before the match starts, seems like it's mandatory for something like this.

6.  There's no obvious 'clan discovery mechanism'.  Let's say that you're new to this game, and you aren't carrying forward a clan membership from any previous fps.  How do you join up?  There's no time in the game to chat about how often you play or what times are good for you or what roles/strategies you enjoy playing in order to find friends/synergies.  WoW has city/trade chat in which people waiting for an event can talk to each other, recruit, bond up and make new guilds/teams/organized groups.  There's no analogue 'public area' for BC2.

7.  The M60 is OP.  Sorry, had to throw that in there.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,False,,pc,True,t3_bk73d,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/bk73d/is_it_just_me_or_is_bfbc2_the_least_communicative/,

I went to the BFBC2 subreddit to ask if anyone knew of a copy of BFBC2 that I could pick up on the cheap. Maybe someone who was selling it or just did not want to play anymore. That is when reddit user jofijk came to my aid. He offered to give me his copy for free. No charge at all. I got the game yesterday and played until I could not keep my eyes open.

This one is kinda close. The island strip just to the south looks and seems to be more like the map, but I'd say some of the geography features look similar.

This is taking way too long and I'm at work. If there is any interest I'll keep this going. Some places, i think don't exist or had their name changed for some reason.

Soon however real life got in the way of my virtual one and I found myself with a ready-made family to support, so less and less of my time was spent online and more and more spent at work, or at home doing responsible parent-y stuff with a steadily shrinking budget.   Hardware upgrades gave way to mortgage and car payments, and certain well know torrent sites substituted for Game and GameStation.

Fast forward a few years and the kids are old enough to have bought their own PCs and consoles, and the only MP game I've played recently is GuildWars.  I see cases for MW1&amp;2 scattered around various TVs and indulge my kids in getting my ass handed to me by various foul-mouthed twelve year old's on XBlive.  Then I see my FPS-addicted daughter playing something called Battlefield: Bad Company2 and sit mesmerised for a couple of hours as she snipes stabs and CGs her way around various maps.   Still I'm old now and my reflexes have gone from reasonable to sloth-like and my PC is nearly a museum piece.   I try a few matches on the Xbox, but whilst fun, I miss my WASD keys and can't quite get to grips with thumbsticks.

A couple of month later a long forgotten savings scheme falls due and I'm suddenly looking at a shiny new PC in my immediate future.   A copy of BFBC2 is bought by my kids and I happily hit the multi-player button.

An hour later I'm raging at my screen.  Where the fuck is the team work?  Ammo?  Health? WTF is a bush wookie?  Hey you douche-bag engineer my tank needs repai.....oh you fucker! Where the fuck did you come from?  What's that beeping?  Fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.......

A few days later and 99% of public servers suck, but my gaming time is in the AM, and pretty much every clan plays in the PM when I'm still doing the responsible-dad-family-time thing.  I play though single player a couple of times, and work my way up to level 11 or so by being a bush wookie long range recon, before slowly loosing interest in due to a lack of actual team play and boredom.

Fast forward again to a few days ago and I figure I may as well play a round or two. Suddenly the servers don't seem to be full of douchebags, and I can place in the middle of the score board on most matches.  

I've switch from mincing around at the back of the map with a long rifle to moving up at a medic or engineer trying to unlock the scopes and other goodies.  My K/D ratio is going down the toilet and I'm grinning from ear to ear and giggling like a loon.

I've not had chance to try the reddit servers yet, since they are pretty much empty when I'm playing, but hopefully one day soon I'll be given permission from she-who-must-be-obeyed to play a few rounds.

* You can repair the transport helicopters in flight. Just hold down the repair button and look around the interior until you find a sweet spot. The sweet spot can move around.

* Whenever possible, wait for tanks to go past you and shoot them in the ass where their armor is weaker. 

* Your pistol is your best friend in a fire-fight. It is much, much faster to switch to your pistol to finish someone off than reloading your primary weapon.

A couple things are different, namely the orientation doesnt really match up 100% like the ""border crossing"" being south of town insted of north, but I'd say it's pretty close. Hit the terrain button and you'll see even that damned wookie hill exists in real life.

I'm gonna go ahead and say this one doesnt fit exactly. I think you really are supposed to be a little bit south. Laguna Verde would be the villiage in the third set of mcoms...I think they fudged this one around a bit for gameplay and balance, but still looks fairly close.

Another one that's basically spot on. 

The Atacama desert is a stretch of 400 miles in northern Chile. It's one of the driest places in the world. Googling for ""atacama shipwreck"" doesnt really yeild that much...the shipwreck is actually pretty charictaristic of Namibia, Africa which literally has hundreds of shipwrecks, many which you can see from google earth.

**[PS3 Reddit League post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bc2/comments/bxv16/ps3_bad_company_2_reddit_league/)**

How would you guys feel about starting a reddit based BC2 League? The competitive format seems to be 8v8 Conquest, or 8v8 Rush. We could do either/both or even have bigger teams if enough people are interested.

I am the current Commissioner of the [Reddit Intramural TF2 League](http://thefpm.com) and would like to do something similar for BC2. What do you guys think?

::EDIT::

Some more info on how I think this should go down:

We would see (generally) how many people are interested. Based on that number we would pick a number of teams to have. Lets say that around 60 people express an interest (for comparison, the TF2 league has 10 teams of 9 each with around 20 more people who wanted to play but didnt get picked), so we would start with 6 teams of 10. We use 10 so that if we play 8v8, each team has 2 potential subs.

I'm not sure how the teams would be picked. For TF2 we did a very successful draft, but here people's skills aren't that well known and the stats pages aren't the best representation. We could randomly assign people to teams, but that could lead to huge imbalances. We could also allow teams to signup, and then have free agents who aren't committed to a team but would be willing to fill the last spot on a 7 man team, etc. No matter how we do it, the first season would essentially just be PUGs so that you get to know your fellow players. I'm open to suggestions on how the team picking would work.

As to scheduling, the TF2 league has a great format right now. The team matchups are announced by me for each week. The teams are required to play that game at any time during the week, as worked out between the teams. IF THEY DO NOT AGREE ON A TIME TO PLAY, they must play at the default time that is also assigned to them at the beginning of the week.

1302032602.0,51,self.badcompany2,gjc45,[Beginner's Guide]: 1-13 to Decent Player in No Time!,vandeemter,60,9,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/gjc45/beginners_guide_113_to_decent_player_in_no_time/,"Getting to the point where I became decent at this game was a bit frustrating; my first several games consisted of a cycle quite similar to this:

Spawn -&gt; Run towards red dots to kill them -&gt; I get sniped/shot/rocketed/etc. and die -&gt; Respawn -&gt; Die quickly -&gt; ??? -&gt; Game ends, my K/D ratio is 2-18 and I'm last on the server.

So, for those who are new to the game, here's a quick set of guidelines to help you go from wtf-is-happening-I-keep-dying to at least a 1.0 K/D ratio while being a useful asset to your team.

**1) Understand the point of the two game modes.** This game isn't a Black Ops-style deathmatch. It's more fun than that. In RUSH mode, you are either defending or attacking two objectives, called MCOM stations. When you're attacking, you have to run to the MCOM and activate it by holding down the action button (E on PC). On attack, your team has a limited number of lives to expend; once this counter reaches 0, you lose. If you destroy BOTH MCOM stations, the map will create 2-3 more sets of MCOM stations for your team to destroy, resetting your lives (called ""tickets"") back to full after each pair you destroy. On defense, your job is to run down the enemy's tickets to 0 before they blow up all of the pairs of MCOM stations. It takes you longer to disarm the MCOM than it takes them to arm it. On defense, you have unlimited lives.
In CONQUEST mode, the goal is to capture and hold as many of the flags as possible. The more you carry, the faster the enemy team's tickets drop. First team to 0 tickets loses. Being killed without being revived drops your team's score by 1.

**2) Easiest class to start with and learn is the medic, in my opinion.** Don't switch around too much between classes or you'll get stuck with no unlocks and feel like a moron for longer than usual. Go medic, and join a squad with 3 other people (max. squad size is 4). Run around with your squad and do what they do. Once you unlock health packs, drop these to heal squadmates and teammates, and when a firefight is about to break out. If you get injured/shot at, run for cover and throw a healthpack towards that cover, so you quickly heal once you're there. Once you unlock the defibrillator, revive teammates that have died ONLY WHEN the coast is clear. Once you get better, you'll be able to make more risky calls, but as you start out, don't do things like run out in front of a tank to revive someone. With a medic, NEVER attempt to take on 2+ enemies unless you're shooting from a pretty good distance or you just flanked them. If you try to kill 2 guys and even manage to get one of them, the surviving enemy will simply pick up your kit, revive his player, and then go back to his own, making your suicide worthless. Remember that as a medic, your goal is to stay alive and revive/heal your squadmates. ONLY when you are safe and have nobody nearby to heal should you try to pick off an enemy/give suppressing fire. Good medics that do their job and revive/heal make others very happy.

**3) Learn to shoot.** The secret for all guns (credit to the responses in my ""how to shoot an LMG"" thread) is to tap the trigger button as quickly as you can to get the highest firing rate while still maintaining accuracy. Always scope, unless they're within a couple feet from you, in which case you can spray hip fire or go in for the knife if they're looking the other way.

**4) USE COVER.** Don't run out into the open, or you will die. Simple as that. Stay behind rocks, buildings, tanks, what have you, but don't run out into the open or you suddenly become a target for snipers and anyone else with a scope.

**5) SPOT enemy players.** On PC, put your crosshairs over an enemy and hit Q to place a red beacon over their heads for ~5-10 seconds that everyone on your team will be able to see. Helps tremendously. Keep in mind that the enemy team can also spot *you*, meaning that if you happen to get shot at, get behind cover for a couple of seconds before coming back out, so your spot-beacon disappears. Running through/behind smoke of any kind will immediately remove your spot.

**6) Practice and learn the maps.** This part is all about the time you invest. When you join a squad, try finding one with higher-ranked players and see what they do, where they hide, which paths they take to/from the MCOM stations, etc.

**7) Don't pilot helicopters** unless you have spent many hours on an empty server practicing. It's harder than it looks to pilot those things without being immediately shot down. And to have any shot at pulling off the stunts that pro pilots perform (flying the attack chopper like it's a falcon on PCP or circling the enemy base quickly in the blackhawk), use the tool in the point below to increase your heli sensitivity.

**8) Download the ""Battlefield Bad Company 2 Configurator""**: http://forums.electronicarts.co.uk/battlefield-bad-company-2-pc/1009847-em-clan-certified-bc2-configurator-best.html 
In this tool, DISABLE bloom and DISABLE negative mouse acceleration. Play with the sensitivities in it until you find something you're comfortable with. I play with a 3500 dpi mouse, and I find the following sensitivity values ideal: 1.00 for Main and Soldier, 6.00 for Vehicle/Stationary Turret, 250 for Helicopter, and 1.00 for Free View. On the Video Settings tab, experiment with increasing the FOV setting from the default 55 to something like 65 or 80 and see if you like it. You see more to your right and left, but things look farther away (i.e. you zoom out).

Useful? If anyone has anything I've missed out, please comment, since I'm looking to learn from some tips as well.

I didn't even move much from my spawn and was getting crazy spots.

We took the first base and moved down to the city area - still I remained way, way back and continued to get spots and 1 or 2 kills. After a while we eventually took 1 station - it was at this point the enemy worked out I was the invisible ever watching eye in the sky and a couple of guys were taking shots at me, but the range I was at it was impossible for anything other than a sniper god to even touch me.

I must have gotten 15+ kills by now and I could see the enemy was raging with anger as all I could see was bullets from every direction coming at me - all missing, I was just too far away!

They then tried to kill me at the UAV station itself - imagine their surprise when they got to the UAV spawn point only to discover I was not even there - I was still at the first spawn - waaaaaaaaay back.

By now there was at least 2 or 3 guys whose sole purpose in life was to kill me - funny as hell as I would always spot them and someone else would kill them. It did feel like a cheap as hell tactic, but it's too funny to annoy the hell out of them.

Here's my story, Im sharing it to see if anyone is experiencing what Ive been experiencing ever since BF3 came onto the scene. It will seem pathetic but I have to get it off my chest. 
Ive always liked video games, Ive played them since I was young but never devoted hours to them and never really considered it a huge part of my life. I would never construct my social life around them and certainly would not be personally invested in them in any way for much of my life. Back in 2009, I started playing COD:MW2, which at the time was an alright game. My buddies and i would switch off playing and having fun for 30 mins or so but we would get bored rather quickly and go do something else. Eventually in March 2010 I heard of a game called ""Battlefield: Bad Company 2"" that would be released that featured destructible environments, which I thought was a much needed feature in all video games and decided to buy it and play it with my roommates. That began a 3 year journey that consumed my life. I've always liked games but I never ""liked"" a game like this. This game was the most masterfully crafted multiplayer experience I've ever encountered and I soon found myself neglecting actual human relationships for virtual ones with my many dozen ""xbros"". This social aspect combined with absolutely pleasureful gameplay turned a simple diversion into an obsession. I would play everyday, for hours, at its height it was the most fun Ive ever had in front of a screen and little else could compare to it fun:time ratio. This all came to a screeching halt when BF3 arrived. I had erroneously assumed that BF3 would be a logical successor to BC2, not only that it would be to BC2 what BC2 was to MW2. Boy was I wrong, what greeted me in Oct '11 was a boring, frustrating and poorly slapped together clusterfuck that attempted to do too much, pander to too many audiences and fail to live up to explicit promises. With it went the community and my xbox live friends who failed to see how BF3 was a ""de-evolution"" (even though most will admit that BC2 was better). All the skills I gained from BC2 not only did not transfer well to BF3 but was a hindrance; stopping, aiming and burst firing is actually discouraged in BF3 and the spray and pray and vehicle whoring was back in full force.  I found myself endlessly frustrated at not being able to consistently shoot  and with xbox live friends that refused to return to BC2. Ive stopped playing video games altogether after my ""live"" subscription expired because I could never relive the epic moments that once was an everyday occurrence. At the end I found myself many pounds heavier, many ""real"" and ""virtual"" friends poorer and depressed knowing that a game as good as BC2 will probably never be made since after the ""success"" (in terms of sales) of BF3. Though people still play BC2 the community is much much smaller and its become harder and harder to have the same amount of fun. Sorry for the long rant, just wished to share my story and to hear if anyone sort of felt the same way.

**tl/dr: I was jaded by how good BC2 was and am depressed that it is unlikely that any other game can live up to it and provide the same amount of satisfaction.**

I need your input and help.,nickmh,56,8,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/vq0cy/the_reddit_bc2_server_is_happening_i_need_your/,"So we're going to go ahead and do this, but I need the community's input.  It's for you guys, so tell me what you want.

**Location:**

The server that badbadrobot has very kindly offered us is based in Chicago.  I personally do not have a problem with that, but it may pose a problem for serious BC2 players on the west coast.  If this is a problem, let me know and we'll find another solution, no big deal.  More on this below.

**Admins:**

We'll need admins, I can't run this show by myself.  Post if you are interested.  You don't need to be experienced as an admin, but I do ask that you are a (very) experienced BC2 player.  There's nothing more annoying than an admin that doesn't know the ins and outs of the game.  

**RedditGaming/RUGC:**

I need someone to find out how we can get the server listed on redditgaming.com again (as well as fix the ""Unofficial Reddit Servers"" link on the right)


**Mumble:**

There were some asking about a voice server.  There is already one setup with a BC2 channel.  We are good there.

**Map Rotation / Rules:**

I am in favor of a 32-man 24/7 Rush server.  Let me know your thoughts.
Rush maps I would like to see:

* Valparaiso
* Isla
* Arica
* Cold War
* Nelson Bay
* Oasis
* Atacama
* *Harvest Day per player feedback*

I don't want a lot of rules on the server.  No stupid swearing filter, no spawn protection, no class limits, no stupid blinking text that comes up everytime someone gets a knife kill.  Maybe just a kick if afk for 5 minutes or so.  Votekick - I'm on the fence about this, convince me.

Thoughts?


**$$$$ / VIP:**

Badbadrobot has suggested either a donation system (which I support) and/or purchasing a VIP slot (I'm on the fence, convince me).  The VIP system that was on the previous server, I thought, was kind of a pain, but if enough people support it then we'll do it.  Let me know what you think.  
If we choose to forgo the Chicago server and get our own server in Dallas, it will be about $32/month, which is not bad at all, especially for a top notch NFO server.  A small donation from a few people every once in awhile will go a long way.  I'm not going to force donation out of people.


If any of the admins of the previous servers are reading this, maybe you can help us out with the process?


**Update 6/28 - Decisions**

Keep in mind that if a decision is not working, we can always change it, so don't get all grumpy just yet.

* I've chosen **Dallas** as the location.  I'd rather have most people have a great experience than have a few have excellent and the rest have average.
* VIP is still a decision I have not made yet.  If the donations seem to be rolling in semiregularly, then I have no problem giving away VIP to those who request it.  If the well runs dry then VIP will cost money.  The community is not as large as it once was, so we'll see if we can actually run it like it used to be run.
* The map rotation is going to stay as it is above, I might throw White Pass on there at some point.
* No hardcore. No conquest for the time being
* Votekick will be implemented.  If it gets abused, it's gone.
* Admins are as follows: PainTrain04, Me, MitchMatch1, possibly 1 or 2 more depending on needs
* *Joeybits* has suggested we do some weekly or monthly events...that sounds awesome.  Maybe some tournaments?

As you know, the defenders cannot go into the attacker's primary spawn point as it's out of bounds or whatever they say. My buddy and I were both medics and I got the idea that maybe if I ran out of bounds(on the way to attackers spawn) and he followed about 5 seconds after, he could revive me 5 seconds before he died, then I could revive him before I died again(but running a little further), then he revived me and so on. This worked right up until we made it to their Apache and were both able to get in, successfully stealing it. The out of bounds countdown went away and violas! Brand new Apache.

I got that from spotting assists. Assisting like crazy. I play Recon, I know my limits with that class. So as soon as I see someone too far to hit, I hammer that Q key like no tomorrow. I follow them for as long as I can or until I get exposed. Helping out like this has been the greatest reward to the team and myself.

I know it's been said before, but I feel it can always be said again.

Now i'm gonna have a pizza and then join another 4000 ticket match. Happy spotting.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,False,,,True,t3_hi9dy,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/hi9dy/the_importance_of_spotting/,

I preordered my key on Steam, so on the 18th or perhaps a bit earlier I will be getting my key -- which I would normally plug into the ""Multiplayer &gt; Redeem Code"" menu.  However, DICE was kind enough to throw some keys at my team so the one I preordered is rendered useless.

**How**

The story with the most upvotes by the time I get the key gets the key. 

**What**

I just want to hear some cool BC2 stories, and sorry fellas this only applies to PC from what I am told.

**Okay!**

**edit:** you don't need to upvote this post if you don't want to. Not karma whoring. I'll create a new thread when it's time.

**edit 2:** Seeing a pretty reliable number of downvotes for each submission.  Downvoting somebody's story to improve your chances (or another's) is a pretty shitty thing to do. I'm considering counting pure upvotes (thanks, Reddit Enhancement Suite!) to counteract this, but I'd really like not to have to.

* You can get the latest version [here.](http://forums.electronicarts.co.uk/battlefield-bad-company-2-pc/1009847-em-clan-certified-bc2-configurator-best.html) 

* [My settings](http://i.imgur.com/3R1Pw.png) for a 720 cpi mouse (Steelseries Xai, hard surface)

* **Main Sensitivity** - affects all sensitivities below it. For example, to play at the game default 0.50 setting, you have to set this to 0.50 and *max out* the rest of the bars to get the same effect. An easy way to get a wider range to play with is to set this at 1.00 and adjust accordingly. 

**Notes:**


* I don't recommend 110 FOV, I think most people will be more comfortable with 70 -90 degrees. 

* Determine your FOV before testing out sensitivities. The higher your FOV is, the higher your sensitivity needs to be to turn/aim to the same effect. For example, if you kept it at 0.50 but increased FOV to 100, mouse movement will feel very dull. 

* Tank sensitivity and gunner seat/stationary sensitivity are shared, so try to strike a balance between the two instead of getting the tank to twirl as fast as possible


* If your game resolution is changing at launch, change something in the in-game options and back. This should fix it. 

* To get your mumble overlay working, change DX11 to DX10 or 9.

### Primary

The Saiga 20K or USAS-12 are your primary. They have the same stats but the Saiga is semi-automatic and the USAS is automatic. Your choice, but I prefer the Saiga because of predictability.

#### What problems does this solve?

Exchanging your machine gun increases your damage output for short to medium ranges. This therefore solves the problem where a team mate goes down as they were entering a room and you want to go in to save them, but there's still an enemy guarding their body. With a machine gun, your damage is not high enough to 1 on 1 kill any other class if every bullet connects. With a shotgun, you can outgun even an assault class in close combat.

This also solves the problem of actually killing people in a building environment! Your DPS, as long as a pellet hits, is equal to engineers and medics at medium range, and far outguns them at short range (&lt;10 meters)

#### What problems does this create?

Your magazine size is now smaller and you can not lay down effective suppressing fire. You can only kill one or two enemies (if you're lucky) with the small 6 shell magazine before reloading. You only get 24 shells spare, so you'll need an assault class constantly refilling your ammunition supply.

In reality, when has anyone actually seen an enemy cower when you lay down suppressing fire? It doesn't seem to suppress anything in Bad Company 2.

We can fix the other problems with perks:

### Perks

I find the shotgun amazing when you combine it with double magazine size perk. This gives you 12 shells of entire-squad-killing power instead of a mere sniper-and-maybe-his-buddy 6 shell magazine. This also lets you gun down a medic or engy at medium range and still have some shells left for whoever you just killed's friend. 

When I'm not with friends on voice chat in a squad, I also like to take the extra ammo perk. This gives me 48 shells in reserve and tons for a secondary pistol.

If I do have a buddy I take the increased health kit range or the Light Combat Equipment perk (since I'm shotgunning, right? Get into the enemies face)

### Pistol

I like the 6-shot revolver. It takes down an enemy in 3 hits to the body or 1 to the head. It chews ammo, but with a good assault class friend or the extra ammo spec, you're good to go.

And don't worry about tracer dart. You're a medic, you don't have explosives. Let an engineer, assault, or recon take care of vehicles (though shotgunning a jeep or 4 wheeler driver is hilarious and easy).

### Some things to keep in mind

You're a medic! Revive people! You get 80 points for reviving a squad mate, so almost double that of killing an enemy. You are also huge credit to team. You also can get a massive number of points by putting health kits down whenever you see wookies derping around near spawn points.

Both the shotgun and revolver take ages to reload, but you can switch weapons or knife nearly instantly. Keep that in mind when it close combat.

**This kit is not well rounded.** If a recon or assault can see you from medium to long range, you're done for. Stay in hiding most of the time and wait for your friends to spot people and watch the mini map for any revives. You can be sure that if someone's died, there are enemies nearby... especially by the time you get there. Here's your chance to surprise them with a grenade and some shotgun blasts.

There's no need to crouch or aim down the sights of the shotgun, so feel free to pop in and out of cover blasting someone at medium range. Assaults and recons will rage at you as their health slowly but surely falls. If you spot them with Q before you duck into cover, you can actually line up your next shot before you jump out of cover.

Anyways, I hope this helps some people. I'm a new player but I've put almost 50 hours into this game so far... and it's great fun :)",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,,,True,t3_exzl7,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/exzl7/do_you_want_to_be_credit_to_team_and_get_a_ton_of/,

I've decided BF3 is not for me: the hit detection (see edit) is a joke, lag is an issue, bugs are abound, and the game *can* be wildly imbalanced. So I'm coming back to, in my opinion, the greatest squad-based online FPS: Bad Company 2!

Much of the lag, bugs, and balance issues will be fixed. But BF3 has an inherently flawed hit detection system that makes me feel like I'm playing some cheap console shooter and not a real FPS. That's my two cents and that's not to say BF3 isn't great in its own way.

EDIT: my use of the term hit detection is misleading. I don't mean hitbox accuracy (BF3 is very good here), I am talking about the inferiority of client-side hit detection, and the timing issues it introduces.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,,,True,t3_nnas1,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/nnas1/back_to_karkand_nope_back_to_bfbc2/,

* Communication is key, use you microphone. It's a lot harder to hear me screaming how much of a dumbass you are if you don't have a mic.

* This has been said over and over again, but some people still don't do it. **SPOT PEOPLE, YOU IMBECILE!** It has a magical effect that brings in bullets from other people.

* If you're sat at the back of the base as a recon on attack, doing NOTHING for your team, you're a dick and I will come to your house, fuck your mother in the ass and stick my shit covered dick in your eye.

Don't give me that ""Well I have more points than you so I must be doing something for the team"" bullshit. You got 1200 points from picking off four people from the back of the fucking base. Hey guess what, retard? **They have unlimited lives, we don't.** Fuck you.

**INFANTRY**

**Switch kits to help your team**

Medic in your squad just gone down? Pick up his kit, revive him, and carry on. Need some ammo? Find an assault kit on the ground, drop yourself some ammo, switch back to your old kit to refill it. Tank just killed your engineer friend and no medic in sight? Take his kit and blow that tank up, then switch back if you need to.

* Are you an assault? Drop some ammo, count to fifteen, drop some more. Use smoke. On attack and need some cover? Use smoke. On defence and getting sniped? Use smoke. On Mortal Combat? Use smoke.

* Are you an engineer? See that damaged vehicle right next to you? It's not trying to suck your dick, repair it.

* Are you a Recon? Help your team move forward by throwing pokeballs, C4'ing tanks and enemy weapons stations and generally doing something other than sitting back and playing with your dick.

* Are you a medic? Look around before you revive someone, maybe the guy that killed them is still hiding in the bush, maybe they're out of ammo. **Maybe if they had a mic they could tell you, maybe if you had a mic you could hear them.** 

If you have just revived a guy twice in less than a minute, STOP REVIVING HIM! There's obviously some sort of problem, maybe a lack of ammo, or he wants to change class to deal with an enemy vehicle. THINK FOR FUCKS SAKE, STOP REVIVING EVERYONE AND THEIR MOTHER FOR EASY POINTS, ESPECIALLY ON DEFENCE. See that tank that just rolled up? A team full of medics and assaults isn't going to fucking beat it, so let me change class when I die.

Once you have all the classes ranked up, ie, all weapons and gadgets unlocked, there is no need for an engineer on defence on Nelson bay. Choose your class wisely, in other words, stop being a dumbass.

Choose your class based upon the situation. Tank just rolled into your base? Go engineer and blow that shit up. No, trying to sneak up to it with C4 as an assault or recon is too risky, just spawn as engineer and throw a rocket at it.

If you're using communication and team work you could probably hit it with a tracer dart and have two or three people launch rockets at the same time, guaranteeing a kill. This is why communication wins games. USE IT!

**VEHICLES**

Don't take the chopper, fly over the enemy base and drop out. If you do this, you're a fucking retard.

**YOU DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, LET THE ENEMY GET YOUR VEHICLE.** I have won many games because some moron got out of his 10% health tank and tried to make a run for it, only to be met by my bullets. We then healed the vehicle and sat back and slaughtered the team. Guess what? The same will happen to you if you do this.

I'm not saying don't get out, I'm saying that if you do, make sure the vehicle has taken fatal damage.

If you're in a tank, and an engineer is trying to heal you, don't drive off and leave him there to get shot. Cover his ass, he is saving yours. Two engineers repairing your tank makes you **almost** invincible. The only counter to this is the previously mentioned launch at the same time method of attack. 3 RPG's/Hot carls hitting a tank at the same time will fuck it up even if they have their whole team repairing that shit. You could try to hit them with C4, but like I said, it's just too dangerous. Any tank driver with half a brain knows to keep an eye out for C4 players.

**YOU CAN SPOT PEOPLE WHILE IN A VEHICLE**

If I am a chopper pilot, I shouldn't have to keep moving the chopper round to spot people for you to shoot.

If you haven't had much experience piloting choppers, I have two words for you; KEEP MOVING. Yes, it's harder to shoot infantry while the pilot is flying fast in circles around an enemy base, but it's also much harder for them to hit the chopper. While they are concentrating on your chopper, they will usually get killed by ground forces.

Again, as with the rest of the game, communication and coordination are key. If you're a pilot and you can't talk to your gunner, don't keep changing your direction every few seconds, be consistent. Fly in circles in the same direction and they will get the idea and lead their bullets as such. Fly around in all directions and what the fuck do you expect them to hit?

If you're the UAV pilot, SPOT PEOPLE.

When you spot the UAV, the pilot is also lit up. Use this to shoot him. This is especially useful on Isla inocentes, first set of MCOM's. This by far is the most dangerous (start point) UAV station to be a pilot on, as anyone who isn't a complete retard should be able to take the pilot down.

I don't have much to say about sea vehicles as I don't have much experience using them. Er, don't fuck it up?

Anyway, I lay a bunch of AT mines on the main road as we ready our defense of the second set, then notice our T80 has spawned towards the back.

BOOM, he smacks in to a mine or gets hit by a rocket and the Humvee is now airborne flipping end over end. I see it flying and think, ""hey, that's just about the right height for me"" and as it flies in to my crosshair I let one shot go from the tank. MORE BOOM as my tank shot hits the Humvee undercarriage dead center in mid-air, the sky turns in to a glorious fireball and the Humvee is now disintegrated. Yes, I still love this game.

I had some people interested in conquest maps as well.  

I changed the original grid style with basically just a light overlay for an even easier call out for that pesky bushwookie, 40mm spammin' ASSault or tubing upstairs engy.  

There is no map for Nelson Bay or Laguna Alta if I had the layout I could easily make them. I tried to implement vehicle spawn points and stationary weapons, but I have a lousy memory.  

The maps are PDF in Google Docs, they are easily printed in 8.5 x 11. Although, some are so large that the maps have been split into 2 pages for easy viewing. The font style makes the I's look like 1's sorry but it's a pain changing it.

edit: I should also note that I have been playing more conquest lately than rush, therefore I have only played Laguna Presa rush a handful of times. I have no idea where the Alpha/Bravo MCOM's are in the last 3 areas. I blame the booze! Damn you booze, why you gotta taste so delicious and make me feel all funny?

1269626025.0,46,self.badcompany2,bios3,"Here, I'll hopefully save you (some more) tickets.",impulsiveboy,50,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/bios3/here_ill_hopefully_save_you_some_more_tickets/,"* **ABC: Always be covering.**

Battlefield 1943 was my first console shooter and I’m 25, so I was obviously at a disadvantage. Eventually, I was ranked 300th on the 360. Now, while I don’t really give a shit about stats or rank, believe me when I say you can seriously learn the game and how to kick ass by simply covering a point in Conquest (or defending in Rush). While the ticket bleed is almost non-existent compared to previous BF games, defending a point will always assure that you learn the terrain and have enemies coming to you, instead of having to figure out where the fuck they’re hiding. No matter what you think your skill level is, the biggest difference between you and the enemy is that they know the maps and the controls better. 


* **Don’t stop ‘til you get enough.**

When defending, destroy everything towards the enemy. Despite what you may believe, you do not need cover. You do not need to be sneaky. You do not need to assault the enemy base. Sit where you are and destroy EVERYTHING. As I’ll mention later, part of the attacker’s goal is to make you doubt they are attacking. Cover is only going to help them sneak into your base. The wall on that M-Com station is only going to help them hide from your bullets. And believe me, they will get into that building, hole or not. No cover simply means that recon sitting in the back of base, not throwing motion mines or calling in mortar strikes, can shoot the guy before he arms. And I can’t tell you how many extra kills I’ve picked up destroying buildings and putting a shell right between the eyes of some sneaky bastard. If I’m attacking on Arica Harbor and I have a building to hide in, don’t send me a hate message when I flank you and stab half your team.


* **Get down. Shut up.**

There’s a lot you can learn from Lt. Dan, despite his lack of legs. If you get a bad feeling from a rock or a trail, get down and shut up. Even though you aren’t going screaming at the enemy, your avatar is. You scream when you kill people. You scream when a grenade flies near you. You scream when someone near you gets sniped. So, get down. SHUT UP. You don’t need to kill everyone you see. You don’t need to throw grenades or pop smoke off next to your position. Just get down. And shut up. I play with surround sound and defend with my ears. You want to sneak past me, gather your squad and come back to knife me later. (When defending or hunting people, throw out a grenade before you rush in. Anyone in the attic/house/bush will scream. I call it the explosive motion mine.)


* **The good fighters of old first put themselves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.**

I never played much Call of Duty, but I did like those quotes they had after you died. Sun Tzu had a lot of good things to say about Bad Company 2, but you don’t know any because you’ve seen the same Epic Fail message a thousand times. The most important thing you can do as the attacking force on Rush is to wait. You might have a ticket counter, but you don’t have a timer. You can flank your enemy and wait for the rest of the team to attack. You can wait for vehicles to respawn. You can wait until the enemy starts to push into your spawn and use any means to get past them. But when you do attack, try to bring everyone. And in the words of Agent Stansfield, I mean *EVVVVVVVEERRRRRYYYOOONNNNNEEEE*. The reason you are losing is because you’re throwing a predictable amount of guys at predictable intervals at the defenders. You want them to get bored. You want them to get lazy. And then you want to attack them in such a way that it doesn’t give them time to think or time to aim, only time to die. You arm, C4, landmine, rocket or whatever that M-Com and you move on to do it again.


* **Aim small, miss small.**

The kill cam is only useful to the enemy when you’re hiding somewhere to get headshots. Get the fuck up on people and introduce bullets into their chest. You do not want to miss people and give them the chance to think. You want them to panic and give them a chance to die. I’m that motherfucker that ran out of cover, directly at you, in order to stab you in the face, all while on my way to your M-Com. Remaining calm and getting a close, clean kill means you don’t have to worry about some recon mortar striking your position. 


* **Let them have B. No, seriously.**

Like I said previously, you want to attack A first, usually. As a defender, you want to defend A always. I can’t tell you how many times I come into a game to see a team defending a destructible building, an M-Com next to a stationary AT or that house on Isla that you can drop with a knife. It sucks to lose a point and I don’t suggest dropping it on your own, but the key to defending is being where the enemy is. (Conversely, the key to attacking being where the enemy isn’t.) If you’ve ever had trouble taking a point before, guard that one and leave the other to those two jackbags on your team firing smoke grenades at one another.


* **Mystery points are the best kind of points.**

If you haven’t discovered it already, you always want to have a “point streak” going. That’s why you aren’t getting that ace pin. If you see an assault die, pick up his kit and throw out an ammo box. If you see a medic die, pick up his kit and throw out a health pack. A recon dies, toss out a motion mine and mortar strike somewhere at random. I don’t recommend picking up an engineer’s kit unless you’re specifically looking for one (or if they have land mines), but hey, I’ve picked up points for an ammo box and repairing a tank at the same time. Points mean unlocks. Points mean your team is doing better than it was before you got said points. And for the love of all that is holy, spot people. You get +20 for someone out of your squad and +30 for someone in your squad killing the guy. And you don’t waste ammo. You don’t have to worry about that guy knifing you. You don’t do anything beyond hitting Q or Back or Select. And those points will just blend into your overall point streak, from all those points you’re picking up from stealing kits. I get the ace pin only because, as an assault, I’m throwing out land mines, health packs and motion mines in addition to my ammo boxes.


* **Stop using upgraded armor... in anything but the Blackhawk... or unless you're a passenger/gunner.**

You aren’t impressing anyone by surviving two seconds longer in that barrage of rockets, mortar strikes and for some reason, grenades. Optics or faster reload in heavy tanks. Let your gunner worry about soft targets. (You do have a gunner, don’t you.) Light tanks, opt for the alt fire or faster reload. The coax in the BMD is great, just aim using the top middle of the T grenade reticule. Faster reload or alt weapons in the Apache/Havok. When using the UAV, skip the alt fire and go for stronger warheads. That crappy machine gun is only going to piss people off and cause them to look for you. You should be spotting and aiming for hard targets, not that guy camping in the concrete building. 

**Ignore this line: I was mistaken.**
Always use smoke while in the Blackhawk. ALWAYS. When someone hits you with a tracer dart, pop smoke and that bitch is gone. Continue to hover and move around, letting your gunner chew up the scenery. 
**I've made a huge mistake.**

Armor is As for humvees, prayer works. Drive fast and aggressively and don’t get shot.

**From [troglodyte](http://www.reddit.com/user/troglodyte ""The best source on anything remotely engineer-related.""):**

Armor lets you take a grand total of ONE more of any type rocket. I know this sounds like harping on the same topic, but an engineer ally lets you take an indefinite number of additional hits, and when you're in a piece of equipment as critical to the team as a tank, you really do need to keep it alive. Armor won't help that; a teammate will.
As for what to equip on the tank, I actually have a few choice options. Faster reload is generally better than increased damage; the DPS is the same but reload is more miss-tolerant. I can't say I agree with the OP on optics over Alt or Damage, but I guess if you like optics that's fine. Personally, my ranking on tanks is Reload &gt; Alt Weapon &gt; Damage &gt; Optics &gt; Smoke &gt; Armor, although mostly I use Alt since it's incredibly useful in a lot of vehicles (the coax gun on tanks is actually better than reload if you're not in a ton of tank battles; it's more killy against infantry than the main cannon).


* **Shoot for the tracks or the back of the tank.**

That goes for anyone shooting at the tank. 


* **Ignore the noisy enemy and find the quiet one.**

That sniper in the lighthouse or that Blackhawk flying around without a gunner is only a minor discomfort. Yeah, he might kill you. You might throw a grenade instead of knifing a fence and kill yourself. Your life has a pretty low cost. When defending, your high value targets are the guys going after the M-Com. I can’t tell you how many people I sneak past while they’re looking up in the air.


* **Those mortar strike binoculars are great for spotting.**

And enemies make the little dot in the middle go red, so you know what to spot. Just saying.

EDIT: Also, much thanks to [TuxedoMax](http://www.reddit.com/user/TuxedoMax ""He's dapper!"") for telling me to swap out my C4 for AA mines. Tossing mines down on an M-Com is much, much better than throwing down C4, for a number of reasons.

OH! And when using the Blackhawk gun, don't bitch about it being underpowered. It isn't. Use it like an eraser and swipe it back and forth over people. If you can't get that to work, lead them slightly and let the heli drag your reticle over the enemy. And if that doesn't work, switch seats to the back and fire rockets/40mm out of the heli and let someone else use the damn gun.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,,,True,t3_bios3,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/bios3/here_ill_hopefully_save_you_some_more_tickets/,

I've been playing since beta and have a god awful and somewhat embarrassing amount of hours in the game...and i have no complaints. Yes, everything that people complain about could be fixed ... but everyday i log on to the game and i have fun playing it.. YES i get pissed if someone is gustav whoring, but then i change my tactics...or servers (hint: there are a lot of servers; FIND A NEW ONE)

Not once have I run into entire teams using gustavs like some people complain about.. or using shotguns as sniper rifles... or cheating like crazy... The exaggeration about the faults of this game have just gotten out of hand.. If you feel it's that bad then play something else!

The threads about how EA/DICE are failing and should be fired are just ridiculous.. the gustav kills infantry, alright, got it.. but it sucks against tanks (ok, doesnt suck.. but it gives people time to get out after you destroy a vehicle which does in fact, suck for you) 

Pistols might shoot across the map, BUT WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING STANDING STILL SO SOMEONE CAN SHOOT YOU FROM THAT FAR. 

So to sum up this annoyingly long post, how about you people who ""cant stand"" the ""ridiculous buffs"" in this game DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT OTHER THAN BITCH. Go to a different server if you feel you're being gustav whored.. or, god forbid, rent your own server so you can kick people that you feel are abusing the game.. But for god sakes, coming on reddit to bitch about it is accomplishing nothing.. 

If you feel like you cannot find a server that doesnt have people using every buff imaginable, then add me (cmyk) to your list and come to the random places i play ... because i seriously do not run into these issues nearly as much as some of you claim to..

1272988143.0,42,self.badcompany2,bzz8y,Here is how to use the tracer to guarantee vehicles die.,Cloven,50,8,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/bzz8y/here_is_how_to_use_the_tracer_to_guarantee/,"1) tracers have no bullet drop.  They don't travel super fast, but you can learn fairly quickly how to lead them.  They have a very long range (hundreds of meters).

2) once a target is marked, by you or by anyone else, then when you bring out your RPG or Carl Gustav, you will see a small dotted-line square appear when you look in the direction of the tank.  

3) center your RPG/CG aim point directly on the square (note: you do not need line of sight.  Just aim at the square.  This takes about 3 seconds to get a missile lock.).

4) now the square is solid and has little numbers underneath telling you how many meters to the target.

5) if it's less than 40 meters, you want to pop out, aim pretty close to the tank, and fire, then pop back into cover.  Note that if you are in front of the tank you are probably going to die; you might want to wait until the tank is otherwise distracted, engaging, or facing a different direction.  Remember hitting the back or flanks of the tank does a lot more damage.

6) If it's &gt; 40 meters, then just tilt upwards and fire your missile into the sky.  It will shoot up about 40 meters, then change its angle abruptly and come down on the (lightly armored) top of the tank.  Note that you can be behind heavy cover, a building, a hill, doesn't matter, as long as the sky is unobstructed for you and the pathway is clear through the sky to the tank, you will get a nice hit.

7) Over 200 meters, you might want to wait until the tank is closer.  It's not doing much to you out there anyway, why reveal your position?

8) Reload as fast as you can.  With a CG you are not hurting the tank super bad so you want to try to maximize your DPS to overcome any repairs that are happening to the tank.  Don't just sit there and stare, get the next shot lined up.  Don't forget that you just announced to the entire world that you are a clueful engineer who is blowing up a prime piece of property, and that a large smoke trail leads back to your location.

9) Time the tank's shots.  If the tank doesn't seem to have the Alt Fire option then he doesn't have machine guns.  If he has nobody riding with him, then all he has is the main gun, which takes like 6 seconds to reload.  Pop out right after a shot to maximize your aim if you have to.  Or, if you run out of ammo, then shoot, wait for him to shoot, and then charge the tank with your (surprisingly effective) repair tool at the ready.  You can cover a lot of ground in 6 seconds and inattentive or busy tanks will often panic.

SPECIAL BONUS TIP: when playing D on the map where your team has the apache and the attackers have the crappy mortaring light tank with the really good anti-air cannon, focus on that tank even though the other tank seems more dangerous.  The anti-air gunnery position is unarmored and the map is wide open with clear skies.  So paint it with a tracer and fire one CG into the air, and it will vector down into that hapless fool, killing him instantly and damaging the tank pretty severely too.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,False,,pc,True,t3_bzz8y,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/bzz8y/here_is_how_to_use_the_tracer_to_guarantee/,

Chain reviving! Please stop, kill the enemy first! If I accidentally revive someone to get shot again straight away I'll apologise in chat :D

Currently one of the most popular topics I am seeing around are about people complaining because they were revived and killed quickly again. I see the frustration, I admit have been frustrated with this too at times, but I have learned to let it go and try to avoid it and so should you. The player doing this obviously has good intentions and is trying to help so chill out. To help avoid this tragic incident, when I am killed I take note of my surroundings so if I do get revived I can do my best to run to cover. 

But this is where my flames come in. It is my own damn fault, but sometimes when I die I go to the bong, and at the no looking back point of hitting it I get revived. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK. So there I am mid bong rip, freshly revived and helplessly standing in the middle of a massive battle with tank rounds and sniper shots whizzing by. God dammit

Sometimes I'll be flanking an enemy squad in an attic or top floor, come in through the back of the house, and my character yells ""DIE ALREADY"" at the door I knife, and the people hear me from upstairs and promptly nade the shit out of the lower floor. I would not get rid of the yelling altogether, however, because I think it's useful if a teammate gets knifed behind you, it's good to know to turn around and be ready.

I get unbelievably mad when I get sniped, see that it wasn't a headshot, and when it shows the killer's specs, I see they're using the M95 with magnum ammo or a VSS with magnum ammo. I understand that they're just doing what the game allows them to, but I also feel it bastardizes the sniping mechanics for which I love Bad Company so much by taking what is normally a skill game and reducing it to one, not necessarily well-aimed bullet (M95), or a spray in the general direction of me and my teammates (VSS). So while it's not a complaint with the game itself, I get pretty mad when that happens to me. I yell at the screen. 

EDIT: What makes you rage when playing?

DOUBLE EDIT: My personal opinion on going prone, I thought it would be a major problem when I first started playing, but now I don't even notice that I can't do it. I can see why there are complaints with it, seeing as if you're in a house, then there's probably a sniper who can see your head through a window. It's definitely an acceptable complaint.

TRIPLE EDIT: There's a strange glitch on PS3, I don't know about other systems, that makes it so that if I have my M24, and I exit a stationary AT or a UAV or any other stationary weapon, my gun fires a shot that doesn't take away any ammo, but I do have to go through the bolt working animation and it does make a loud sound, revealing my location.

I do however, like to win.

Now I *FINALLY* have my defibs, I've adopted a possibly annoying, albeit in my opinion effective strategy. 

When I've had enough of being a mediocre run and gunner I play psycho medic.

I run around with light wieght pack, defibrilling everyone that dies thus allowing our team to maintain a line, and everyone to remain in the fight. 

1 out 5 times the people I revive go on to die within moments, this does not deter me however, as unless they are under a stream of *constant* fire or a tank is present, I revive them again regardless. The spawn timer is too much of a punishment, and we need everyone on the battlefield we can get. 
Esepcially in the pressure points.

I don't do this in some game situations, but when we're making a push or a defensive stand I revive everything that dies. It's not about me getting a high score either, I just like seeing my team push up.


This strategy leads to some people loving me for effectively stopping their spawn timer and some hating me for lowering their k/d.

I couldn't give a toss however, as I'm Stalin: and it doesn't matter if you die and die again as long as we win the game.

But first, some context! As you might know, us Euro redditors have a group now on the Mumble server and play as a squad. We got owned by a competing team of which one squad really knew how to pilot the chopper. Their tactics was classic: move around, don't hover, good gunners, W ALT W for the pilot.

What I've seen for the first time was the tactics of switching drivers so nobody can tracedart you -- if you get traced and you notice it, the driver/pilot who has some firepower/armor boost exits the vehicle, his teammate with smoke goes as a driver, trait becomes active, vehicle applies smoke, loses dart, and the first teammate enters again (unless they're in a helicopter).

We really got annihilated by that squad, we had no chance with the rest of our team (minus a squad) being non-coordinated players. It almost felt unfair, since you're playing against a vehicle with several upgrades almost at the same time (but I admit it's fair). So if you haven't used this tactic yet, think about it. :o)

I platted the weapons I wanted to and hit level 50.  I have no idea why, but that was my goal.  [Click for player information](http://bfbc2.statsverse.com/stats/pc/buttenthusiast/).


Some parting thoughts:


* No one ever used the vehicle spec for smoke.  It's the most useful thing in the game for tanks/apc's/helicopters.  Removing tracer darts was amazing.

* I could never fly a helicopter.  Damn was I terrible.  Sometimes I would be playing after a night of drinking and not be able to take off the landing pad.  Imagine piling into a troop transport and having the pilot immediately ditch into the ocean out of bounds -- everyone dies.  It was hilarious, but I also felt bad.  After a while I just never got into the pilot's seat.

* The map design was excellent. 

* The audio was excellent.  Playing with a surround-sound system with the volume cranked up was always excellent. 

* The weapon/gadget hierarchy is amazing.  Kudos to the designers.  Every gun had a distinct look and feel, as well as sound, with the exception of the MP-412 Rex and the 1911.  They shared the same sound and had just about the same damage. 

* There are no goddamned jets.



One last thing I'd like to mention, and something that will be a big bone of contention: battlefield bad company 2 feels dumbed down.  Way down.  I understand it's a combination console/pc game so it's going to try to strive toward the middle ground and make more inroads to a wider audience, but I still felt that there is a lot missing.  *I am comparing my experience with BFBC2 to BF2*.




* I miss the commander mode.

* I miss prone.

* I miss the variety of classes.  Compare 4 classes to [7 classes](http://wiki.bf2s.com/classes/battlefield-2).

* I miss three factions.



Two more random thoughts.  I noticed not very many people used smoke as assault.  Kind of odd.  And damn did the game need a limit on how many people could play recon and have a sniper rifle.  Always annoying to look behind you and see 30 dudes hiding behind a rock.  I think a redditor summed that up quite well in a comic.

The farther you are from the base, the harder it is to defend. I just played a match where 10 of 12 guys were trying to push forward leaving me and one other dude on the opposite squad had to fend off the whole attacking team. Why? Because no matter how good you are, all it takes is one single guy to slip past, chill, have his squad spawn off him, and walk in and take the base.

Is that the alarm going off? If it is, quit standing there like a douchebag and get to base. I don't care if you have a guy in your sights 300 meters away from THE OBJECTIVE.

Is anyone sitting on the base RIGHT NOW? If not, go there NOW.

Are you spotting every last person you see? No? START IT. A sniper can be the team MVP without firing one round all match if he finds a nice perch and spots every enemy.

Are you in a tank/chopper and not the pilot/driver with an alarm ringing? Get your ass out of your seat and get to the damn base.

Are you a medic? Have you made sure there's plenty of health around the base? Are you de-fibbing fallen comrades so we don't lose position? No? Get off your damn M60 and spread some vital signs.

Quite frankly, if you're more than a short, covered perimeter away from the base you are hurting your team. I don't give a shit if you finish the game 25-13, you did not help.

The first couple of weeks were spent wondering *""What the hell is happening, where am I being shot fro-- Damn, dead again!""* Shortly after, though, I ran into some skilled Redditors, started improving my skills, and played this game incessantly on the old Dallas server while partaking in the epic discussions on the Mumble server. While still noobing around, [I captured a beginner's-luck clip that matched perfectly with the legendary Leeroy Jenkins audio, which I still show friends to this day when they ask if BCBF2 was any fun](http://youtu.be/PgbcOfYYl0c). It certainly was.

Teamwork-centered gameplay with voice chat and squads? It was everything I thought it would be and tons more. I loved the small things, the minor glitches that would spawn countless strategies. On Arica Harbor, [I made a video illustrating how you could sneak the tank over the hill to flank the second set of objectives](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoXLV5eMieY) after seeing a similar video on driving a Jeep over the same ledge. The fact that you could counter tank sniping on the first set of Arica Harbor MCOMs by placing a tank in front of the non-collapsible one and having two squadmates constantly repair it. On Laguna Presa, you could arm the 3rd-stage MCOM on the wooden balcony by jumping up and down underneath, hidden by the shadow, and holding ""E."" For the third set of MCOMs on Valparaiso, you could jump onto the ledge on the side of the map and drop down right beside MCOM A. You could arm the B MCOM on the same stage by swimming underneath it, while exposing yourself to danger since you'd start treading water and could no longer shoot. You could go Assault with smoke grenades and fire them at close range to stealthily open up holes in walls, or lobby them into choke points to get your squadmates through safely.

And that AT-4. God damn if this isn't my favorite weapon I've ever used in a game. The learning curve was huge, but once you practiced sufficiently long you could shoot a perfect spiral and plant perfect hits on any helicopter in sight. It truly was skill-vs.-skill when a practiced AT-4 engineer faced off against a good pilot who could dodge and weave through the AT-4s coming their way. As a pilot, do you go for the armor perk to give yourself a buffer against being hit by a rocket? Or do you choose smoke, so you can avoid tracers? As an engineer, do you go AT4 or tracer-RPG with a squadmate to snag a second tracer hit as soon as the heli pilot dropped smoke and disabled the first tracer plant? [Tagging spawn-camping wookies with the tracer also provided tons of fun](http://cloud.steampowered.com/ugc/558654597235623639/DA14F32F09FD4858B558271F6B3AF809A1289FE4/).

When BF3 came out, I stopped playing BFBC2 and hopped on that bandwagon instead. On paper, it was better in many ways. But still... it just lacked all the little things, the small bugs that added tons of depth in strategy (e.g. trying to counter a counter to a bug/map shortcut), the better visibility without lens flare everywhere, the fact that the simpler principles of the game could be much better elucidated and used as a foundation for strategy and tactics. In BFBC2, the game mechanics provided a playground on which you could crawl and run in whichever way you wanted. With BF3, the playground expanded in size but was also suddenly surrounded by a thick fence a foot away from every surface; there were more mechanics to explore, but you were bound to crawling around them instead of simply using them as a foundation on which to base your playstyle. It was like taking a game of chess, expanding the board and adding some new pieces with gorgeous new shader effects, but limiting visibility to only one tile around each of your pieces and adding a two-tile choke point to the center of the board--a rocket-spammed zone through which you *have* to pass in order to increase the ""action"" in the game, thus keeping new CoD experimenters from becoming bored too quickly by forcing them to engage in some level of critical thought and strategic planning before mashing W, spacebar, and Mouse 1. Also, the /r/bf3 community was a similar experience to joining a CoD forum, with exceptions to the rule being few and far in between.

I tried going back to BFBC2, but when I played it after some hundred hours filled with increasing disappointment and dissatisfaction with BF3, I could only notice the ""on paper"" mechanics that BF3 had technically improved, like the fact that gun reticles/aim moved with spread, and did not generate a simple cone of fire like they did in BFBC2. And then I went back to BF3, and could only notice a complete lack of the fun and innovation that defined BFBC2.

This, combined with the fact that Origin is likely the worst experience with DRM I have ever encountered (*I currently have to maintain and update two separate BF3 installations on the same machine--one being a ""Limited Edition"" and one being a ""Standard Edition""--after online support applied a band-aid fix to a Battlelog error I was having by adding a second game key to my account... and somehow, uninstalling either of the two versions of the game also uninstalls the second one, just as* installing *either of them also installs the second*), has made me stop playing either of these games for months now, without even noticing.

Half of our team rage quit, which makes it that much harder.

Normally, I'm impressed when people are good with vehicles, but these pilots destroyed every heavy machine gun and the anti air and the tank is destroyed almost immediately after spawn. Such unbalanced bullshit.

I know on the PC it's easier to shoot guys with tracers, is there anything else I can do? Do any of the LMG's damage them?

Some of this may or may not apply to other joysticks... 

**Calibration Trick**

If calibration isn't helping, and you still can't seem to get the full range out of a joystick axis (eg. Cant turn right quickly or can't rotate left), try this - run the calibration program, but don't utilize the full range of the joystick axis, only go 50%, or 75%, or wherever your joystick drops off in-game. Doing the same with the opposing side of the axis may help balance the controls out.  If this works, you should find your sluggish joystick has a much improved sensitivity and 'full' range within the axis or axes.


This link [HERE](http://anythingispossibleyou.blogspot.com/2010/02/logitech-3d-joystick-repair-and.html) will help you bring an old or stubborn Extreme 3d joystick back to life:


Lots of good info [HERE](http://forums.bf2s.com/viewtopic.php?id=81419), including **'The infamous WD-40 trick'**, which actually worked quite well for me.  See above link for instructions on taking apart the joystick: 

Aside from that, I use the Logitech Profiler to map keystrokes.  Sometimes unplugging/replugging in your joystick can fix problems, especially after joining a new server.

Researchers: SLAYbraham Lcln, delvach, Dwt DIEsenhower, Holocaust2121, DustyApollo, ActiveTraxx, M0nk34man, Kool anda Gang, Daisydaze, C1 On The Brink, and sporku5

Setting: Operation Hastings

**A pile of forty-two mines, placed under the vehicle:** 

* Launched light vehicles in the air. Does not rip skin off.

* Ripped the skin off of tanks, launches them into the air, and when they land, they go under the map. Similar to the boat glitch. New glitch found! [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj_ET1hJiLI)

* Rips skin off of boats, sends them under the map, where they fall indefinitely. (When I got out of the boat I was teleported back up to the map. I was invisible and moved very quickly. Fellow players could see my wake as I moved around them. I was standing in the water and as soon as I touched land it killed me.)

* Absolutely *does not* affect Hueys. This is drastically different than it's effects on Apaches, Havocs, and the like.

**Helicopter knowledge:**

* The flamethrower will completely incinerate a Huey with two to three seconds of direct fire. FINAL CONCLUSION: Hueys are made out of ducks.

* Friendly TNT detonated on the hull of the Huey has no effect on the flight pattern. Once again, this is unlike C4'S effect on Apaches and the like.

We tested various weapons on different parts of the Huey. The format will be as follows; Weapon name, tail damage from one bullet, engine damage from one bullet, and nose damage from one bullet. Magnum ammo was not used. If you want to calculate Magnum ammo damage differential, add 25%.

* M60, -1, -2, -3

* M16, -1, -2, -3

* M40, -8, -11, -13

* PPsh, -1, -2, -4

* 870 Slugs, -5, -10, -13

* 870 Buckshot, 0, 0, 0

* M79 is a two hit kill without Explosive Mark 2

**Mortar Strikes:**

Multiple mortar strikes *can* be called in on the same location simultaneously. When 5 people call in a mortar strike on one Vietcong beautiful things happen. [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SigUiOX19TY)

**Flamethrower Knowledge:**

* Equipping Explosives Mark 2 does *not* increase the range of the flamethrower.

There is a funny story to go along with it as well that is legend in the Canadian Forces that involves the Carl G.

In Canada there is a regiment called the Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG's). They are the regiment you see in Ottawa dressed in those big blacks hats doing drill on Parliamnet Hill or at the Governor Generals Mansion. But they are also a combat regiment (Infantry I think) and the GGFG's will be out doing combat excercises. 

Anyway...years ago on a combat training exercise in Petawawa I think -Petawawa is a huge base North of Ottawa - the GGFG's were out there on an excercise in full kit which included the Carl G. Apparently as the story goes the regiment ""lost"" a Carl G out in the field and a large search was conducted to try and find it.

Ever since then the Governor General's Foot Guards (GGFG's) are un-officially known as the  ""Gotta Go Find Gustavs"" (GGFG's)

I'd like to point out that in order to win a game, you don't need a single one of these items.   MCOM's?  Press a button, no gear required.  Flags, just stand there, no gear required.  IMHO, you can be useful no matter your kit.

To me, making the class-unique items come slightly later in the game is a good thing.  BC2 is a complicated game: bullet drop, destructible buildings, tons of vehicles, huge maps, big teams, squad respawning etc., etc.  It's a lot to get used to without wondering what these boxes are and why doesn't this gun shoot anything beside a blinking light?  BC2 is unlike any other modern shooter because it has these features.

So, new players, take the opportunity to really know the maps, figure out squad spawning, what walls of buildings blow up, how long mortar fire lasts for, how to deal with bullet drop and a hundred other things.  Learn the things that are common to *all* classes and by the time you figure those out (and probably long before) you'll have unlocked those ""essential items"".  And I nearly forgot to mention there is nothing stopping you from picking up dropped kits and using them.

tl;dr Have patience, learn the game and then learn the classes.

* VOIP seems to be working fine
 
* Semi-auto rifles are much easier to handle, when they say they settle faster they weren't kidding. Also, my baby, the AUG can be handled on full auto to track targets now... that was a surprise. 
&gt; Weapon tweaks have been implemented based on PC public feedback
 
* Running seemed faster (I may be crazy on this one)
 
* Ping was showing in server browser
 
* The new chat box and system works well
 
* The knife works!
 
* Hit detection boxes are bigger, but nothing terrible. BF2 hallmark right there, dieing behind cover ಠ_ಠ
 
* Arming, disarming and flag capping are all worth much more and points after death makes a HUGE difference
 
* Load times are faster. Significantly so for me

So we've been playing and I was the first to approach level 50 after 400+ hours in game.  Finally last week we're playing and at the end of the round I watch my score creep closer and closer to that magical 50.  We're on a server where our team is getting worked like a white guy at a Korean massage so we decide to server hop.  At the new server, we don't manage to land on the same team while on Valparaiso.  We're attacking the 4th set of MCOMs and I'm running towards the right MCOM when an enemy hops down in front of me, blam with the 40 mm shotgun and he's instantly dead, I immediately hear FUCK YOU! over Teamspeak, my friend bitching for me having just killed him and no sooner had the laughter settled when the magical level 50 pin appears on the screen.  Turns out my friend had been the final points that pushed me over.  

So, find some friends, get a teamspeak, vent or just talk on Skype and play and have fun, you won't be disappointed.

I got banned for 'questionable gameplay'.  What does that mean?  Let me tell you what happened to cause this.

I was heading to a point.  2 squad mates are on the opposite side drawing fire.  I flank, come up behind two guys, knife the first and shoot the second.  A third is running across an open area at my two sqaudmates.  I shoot him in the back.  We take the flag.  I start running to the next flag when...BAM....banned for 'questionable gameplay'.  I admit, it was a pretty ninja move (for someone that sucks).  I was actually a bit proud of myself for pulling it off smoothly.  Then banned.

The second server was similar.  Had a quick streak of success (after 3 deaths in a row) when I get the same thing.

I am totally against base rape or camping.  I wasn't even close.  I have never hacked (and don't know how to be honest).  I can't tell if I am honored that they kicked me for playing well, or if I am pissed to get kicked.  I did get back on one server and politely asked for the admin to tell me what I did.  No response.  Then I was pissed.  Tell me what I did at least.  

It ruined my vibe for the rest of the night and I wasn't playing well after that at all.

TL;DR:  I got banned for killing a bunch of guys in rapid succession and taking a point.  ""Questionable Gameplay"".  And I suck and don't cheat.

***EDIT***  Thanks for the comments.  I am sure that I should be happy to get banned as it meant I was actually playing well.  You can tell it doesn't happen often for me, so I was pissed to get derailed when things were going well.  I'm not going to waste more time with that server or worrying about it.

Seems every server I jump on (Aus/Oceania) is replete with one or two sides who simply cannot be fucked playing properly anymore.  For example:

* Nobody spots, ever
* Lazy attackers, happy to sit close to spawn taking potshots at the enemy (special mention to the first stages of Port Valdez, Valaparasio and Isla)
* People seem happer to have tanks and bradleys push them right back, rather than swap to engi class for a life to take it out
* Snipers who stare at armed mcoms, trying (failing) to shoot disarmers and not dropping mortars
* Gustav noobs seem to be back in vogue
* Team stacking seems to be in too- its so rare that I go into a game and its evenly matched, always seems to be one team absolutely steamrolling the other
* Defending idiocy is rife, nobody strategically guards choke points to MCom's, rather they'll take off to try and hunt down enemies somewhere when all it needs is one to slip past and then both MComs get armed with nobody to defend/disarm
* Usual problems with idiot medics not dropping health, assaults not dropping ammo etc (which in fairness has been pretty common since release, but seems as bad if not worse than usual)

So yeah, I'm not really sure whats going on, but it seems paticularly bad over the last four to six weeks.  Its not a lone soldier type game, and you rely on your team to at least have a little bit of common sense to win... Personally my stats have been taking an absolute thrashing lately as I seem to be othe only person even trying to push forward on attack or be a little bit strategic on defense.  Perhaps I've just had a string of bad luck, but I'm interested to find out if other have been experiencing the same thing lately

1274231939.0,34,self.badcompany2,c5qu1,People need to stop measuring skill based on their position on the scoreboard and start measuring based on contribution towards achieving objectives and winning the round.,,39,5,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/c5qu1/people_need_to_stop_measuring_skill_based_on/,"Too many people seem to think a good way to measure how good someone is by basing on how high up they are on the scoreboard. Bad Company 2 isn't a fragfest game where the best kill-death ratio or most points matters the most.

What makes Bad Company 2 different than so many other FPS games is it's reliance on teamwork and goal achieving congruency. This game isn't about singularity, which is why people hate camping bushwookies that contribute nothing to winning the round.

I find that the ""worst"" players when it comes to killing the enemy often end up being some of the best players for winning the round for a team by helping taking out or defending MCOMs and helping take control or defending bases on Conquest. You can be a perfect shot as a Recon, but if you're just camping with the rest of your team on Attacker on a Rush map when you need to be taking out MCOMs, you're being useless to your team. The Defenders have infinite tickets, your only goal should want to either be taking out the MCOM yourself or giving support to your team to protect the MCOM once its charge is set.

On Conquest, you can be running around racking up a ton of kills lowering the enemies tickets, but your attempts will be futile if the enemy is controlling the bases. Controlling 2/3 or all 3 bases on Conquest will guarantee that you win a Conquest round.

Racking up kills and points should be an indirect and secondary goal/objective. If you are actively contributing to winning the match your score should naturally be good, if not the best.

Score and Objective achieving are not mutually exclusive. If you have a great score, that doesn't necessarily mean that you are achieving any of the objectives or providing any support towards the team. However, if you are achieving objectives and winning the match, your score will most often reflect that.

There are also contributions to the team that don't get you many points, but are absolutely fundamental to winning a match. Kill assists are big, you may get upset that someone got your kill, but the faster the enemy gets put down, the faster you can move on to someone else. Spotting is absolutely key. It's of the utmost importance that your teammates know where enemies are if you see them. Spotting may be irritating, but you wouldn't believe how much the tides get turned when everyone is spotting (Obviously this doesn't work too well for Hardcore mode). Even sacrificing yourself or making someone stop to kill you can make a huge difference. You weren't able to kill that guy in the MCOM room, but you managed to delay him long enough for the MCOM to blow up.

Your primary goals should be to help your team achieve objectives and win the round, no one likes to lose. Let your KDR and points be secondary goals. If you're doing your duty to win the round your score should reflect that anyways, and if it doesn't it's still more important to help the team win, don't be selfish.

Hopefully I didn't come across as whining or anything of the sort. I thought I'd just explain that this game isn't about being the best on the scoreboard, it's about contributing to the win of each round. I know efforts of this mostly go unnoticed and it's easy to point to a scoreboard and base skill off of that, but please understand that sometimes that guy that was near the bottom of the scoreboard was the reason your team won the match.

Edit: 

**TL;DR:** Basing skill on where you are on the scoreboard doesn't necessarily mean anything. You can have the best score, but if you didn't help your team win, your efforts were mostly unused. Many players end up being pretty low on the scoreboard, yet end up being the deciding person that got your team the win. Skill should be based on ability to help the team reach its objectives and win the match and not on being on the top of the scoreboard.

It does NOT factor in anything but K/D, not wins or losses or score, or teamplay, just an ELO ranking of your own K/D.

How is this calculated?  Simple:  Everyone has a number.  This is not displayed, however, it can be seen at some stats site such as BFBCS.com.  [My number, for example, is 431 at the moment.](http://bfbcs.com/stats_360/Zulu%20Zulu%20Zulu) Every time I am part of a kill (that is, any time I kill another player, or die to another player) my number is plugged into a calculation with their number, and each of ours changes accordingly.  

**If I kill...**

* A lower #'d player: My score goes up a little, theirs goes down a little

* A higher #'d player: My score goes up more, theirs goes down more

**If I die to...**

* A higher #'d player: My score goes down a little, theirs goes up a little

* A lower #'d player: My score goes down more, theirs goes up more

This caters to kills-focussed and objective ignoring playing first and foremost and leads to players with a W/L of around [1.75](http://bfbcs.com/stats_360/UDLawman) to be ranked higher in ""skill"" than those who take objectives, help their buddies and actively contribute to the outcome of the game.  This was present in BC1 as well, as players were obsessed over retaining their ""Green 2's"" they would spawn-camp, base-rape and be all around assholes all in the name of getting enough kills to ensure their status symbol would never go down.

This number can easily be manipulated through focussing on kills rather than objectives, and more often than not, is nothing more than a symbol of a positive K/D.

Most would leave, but for some reason I feel compelled to turn it around, nothing is more rewarding than getting everybody to work together and turn the tide from 300/500 tks to 150/0.  Anyways, these are the things I always see on bad teams (hint if you are doing this, please stop)

1.  People aren't adaptive,  ex:  the enemy has 3 tanks at B on Heavy Metal, but your base has unused tanks just sitting there, and nobody is spotting/darting tanks, or even attempting to take them out.  (hint, you don't just have to be engie to take one out)  what is even worse is when the enemy has a killer gunship team, they are racking up kills and just making it hell on everybody.  However, nobody seems to be trying to take them out.  I think that baddies must think gunships are the only way to kill gunships.  Heck, I kill them with the tank machine gun all day long, if they are close enough I'll dart them and rpg.  I spot them all day long and communicate in chat.  Once the pilots figure out they can't stay alive, only the dumb ones will continue to fly.

2.  Errryyyybody wants to use the gunship.  Nothing like the enemy having every flag and your spawn has 5 people running around the empty heli pad, shooting to show their determination for the heli.

3.  God awful pilots.  Of course once one of them takes off, they either bail out without warning, or just fly upside down into something (if you don't know how to fly, join empty server for 20 min and figure it out)

4.  Tank drivers that think they are rambo.  If somebody wants your tank dead, they WILL kill you.  So.... bad tank drivers always seem to drive right into the middle of 13 engineers out in the open all the while an engineer is running behind them trying to repair but they drive to fast.  Good tankers know to use cover, and backup for repairs when needed and sometimes just up and get out and kill the infantry threatening the tank.

5.  People that never defend flags, but constantly cap them.  again with heavy metal for instance.  You have B but nobody is defending it, the enemy is coming towards it with 2 tanks and 3 infantry and you are trying to cap A (as US team)  that is a terrible idea, because once they have B they can come at A from 2 directions.  The policy should be defend B all game.  Some maps just have that ONE flag that turns the tide.

6.  Snipers.  I get it sniping is fun, but if you aren't racking up the kills you might wanna do something else.  If your team has no flags and there are 5 people on the oasis island as if they think nobody knows about your little secret spot, you are helping your team lose.  The truly good snipers stay on the move once they've been found out, and run around pistoling people in between spots, also they spot EVERYTHING regardless of if they have a shot on it.

7.  When there are 200 people in the bradley.  That thing seats allot of people, but really more than 2 passengers is a. asking for somebody's best multi-kill ever, and  b. not really helping that much.  At any given time, you should be thinking, what does my team need most right now?  Should I be killing that tank over there, or is sitting in the bradley with 4 other players really helping out?

for the TLDR types, I'll say this.... if you are a baddie, please learn more about the game, squad up, watch videos, read guides, and when you feel like you are just getting spanked by the enemy, like they really have their stuff together, take notes, and soon you will be that team.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,True,,,True,t3_k9x44,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/k9x44/this_game_rewards_teamwork_but_always_starts_you/,

* When using C4 or ammo/health crates, jumping and looking upward will propel the C4 much, much farther away.
* Using a sniperrifle to body shot someone at close range will result in an instant kill.
* High optics and UAV make a very deadly combo. Fly up high into the air, zoom in, rocket and spot away. 
* [here](http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/423140.page) is a post detailing on how to change the fov and [here](http://forum.ea.com/eaforum/posts/list/499371.page) is a possible fix for hit detection.
* [here](http://www.bf-games.net/download/2787/gossamers_bad_company_2_launcher.html) is a good tool for modifying everything you need.
* If a medic gets killed, pick up his kit and revive him. If you press the switch kits key at the exact same time that you rez him, he will be rezzed, and you will both have your original kits.
* If you hold E as you approach the mcom, you'll automatically start arming/disarming it when you get in range. No muss, no fuss about picking up fallen comrades' weapons. Additionally you can move, jump and fire your weapons while disarming.
* If you are rolling recon, spot. If you are playing assault, spot. Playing ninja engineer? spot. Playing holy savior that is medic? SPOT!!!!
* Pick up kits lying on the floor in order to toss kits around. Will award mass of points and will be good for your team. You can even revive someone if you pickup a med kit. Just revive and pickup your old kit at the same time.
* [here](http://denkirson.xanga.com/722757523/bad-company-2/) is a good list of weapon statistics.
* Repair your teams vehicles - also don't drive off leaving your engie in the middle of the battlefield holding a repair tool.
* Using smoke grenades can remove the tracers off teammates and vehicles, as well as using the smoke countermeasures perk. In addition to that, if the tracer lands on a part of the vehicle that can be blown off, removing that part will remove the tracer.
* Quickswitching for a reload or for shotguns is very useful: It's much easier to tell this in normal mode, because it shows the ammo counter, but when you reload, the number of ammunition loaded in your weapon will reset during the animation, and the instant that it resets, your weapon is technically loaded and you can shave off a second or so by quickswitching after that reset. Use it especially on rockets, it will save you seconds.
* Throwing a grenade near an enemy will cause them to yell out ""grenade!"" Toss one through the window of a building and listen for screams. When you're an assault taking a conquest flag or guarding an M-COM you just lit, sit on an ammo box and throw grenades at every avenue of approach. Anyone you don't kill will give away their position and be an easy target.
* Every gun has a perfectly accurate first shot, save snipers (irony) because of bullet drop. You can snipe with ANY weapon (besides non-slug shotguns, of course). Just line up the crosshairs and tap-tap-tap.
* Watch your map. Watching friends play, I've noticed that they die way too often by enemies that I would've seen on the map and eliminated. Also, if you see a spotted enemy pop up on your screen, take a second and see if you can shoot him.
* If your enemy overflows the circle of your ironsight, spray-fire from the hip. If your enemy's torso fits completely within the ironsight, burst or single-fire only.
* Don't spot in too quick succession, after five times it has a cooldown of about 5 seconds. Spot once every two seconds for no cooldown. 
* Collapsed buildings are one of the greatest forms of cover on conquest maps, hardly anyone thinks about checking them for enemies.
* If you're assault, master the smoke grenade; when used properly it can far exceed the usefulness of the explosive grenade on any gametype.
* If you're using an ATI card and experiencing long loading times, force the game to load in DX9 mode; load times become near instant.
* Practice using the Ironsights on a gun; an extra grenade, faster run speed or other perk can come in very handy.

1272501351.0,36,self.badcompany2,bxi7f,How to not suck at defending in rush (includes bonus rant).,connery_007,41,5,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/bxi7f/how_to_not_suck_at_defending_in_rush_includes/,"It has come to my attention that most people are incredibly stupid when it comes to defending MCOM's in rush.  Fortunately, I am here to lift you from your collective stupidity with a few protips.  The problem is that on a rush map, time and again, I've seen the same poor defensive play from so many people that I've been compelled to write something about it.  We'll use Isla Inocentes (sp?) first set of bases as an example-

Generally, the standard tactic for the attackers on this map goes something along the lines of UAV attack, Helicopters x2 doing laps of the island till they get taken down, at which point they'll bail and try to arm.  While this is happening, around half a dozen snipers will be in position and start sniping and mortaring indiscriminately.  Generally, the defensive tactic for most people I've seen is either to run around the island as a medic, firing at helicopters and cowering behind the shed on the top of the hill.  Fast forward a bit and if you haven't lost an MCOM yet, this is where things turn pear shaped.  

The snipers have held the defenders back, allowing assaults and medics control of the front shoreline, at which point everything turns to shit and you get rolled back.  The tactic, people is to attack the attackers.  You won't win a rush game by sitting behind the shed taking pot shots at attackers.  Keeping them off the island completely is paramount, and this tactic goes for any map in the game.  I have lost that many rush games because the entire defensive team finds it easier to sit *behind* the mcom and try to shoot people arming it, rather than securing the perimeter and not allowing the attackers to even be within striking distance of it.  

Back to my example, dealing with most of the snipers in isla inocentes is a trivial matter.  One assault spamming smoke onto the hill is usually enough to take care of most of the snipers, but they can't do that sitting at the back of the base.  Just because you're defending, doesn't mean you can't push forward.

tl;dr summary- When defending:

* Use smoke - barely anybody does, and even less so when defending
* Motion mines are your friend
* Hold the bases perimeter: sitting at the back of your base, scoping the MCOM is only a valid tactic if you have a ring of iron (read: teammates) in a forward defensive formation taking care of the attackers
* Letting the enemy control the area in front of the mcom is a recipe for disaster- This is what you are defending first and foremost, allowing the enemy close to the mcom invites a melee around the base, rather than at a control line some distance from the objective.
* Use common sense.  If you're defending and losing, there is no good reason to worry about you KDR and switch to a sniper.  Sure you might get a few kills, but you lose the game.  The whole point of battlefield is to win the game.
* Making the attackers fight for every inch of ground will grind their tickets down, as opposed to giving them half a chance of arming or letting them pick the best sniper spots to mortar destructible MCOMS
* Dammit soldier, don't be a fucking pussy-- FIGHT!

I can't begin to count the number of times me or my squad have been the only ones on an entire team actually pushing back against attackers.  Its how you win when you're plaing defence and its phenomenal the number of players who are unwilling to do this.

Suddenly everyone left except for me and one other guy.  So he and I were basically hunting/hiding/chasing each other across the map as we tried to capture each other's flags.  It was of the most thrilling games of hide and seek I've played.  It was also freaking hilarious at times.  We played for like an hour together.

1340320968.0,34,self.badcompany2,veol4,1470 point chain on Nelson Bay Rush,vgsandrew,38,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/veol4/1470_point_chain_on_nelson_bay_rush/,"So I was playing solo the other day with a squad of randoms, defending on Nelson Bay Rush.  Our team was pretty noobish, to the point my whole squad was set up inside the destructible B Mcom building, just waiting for the enemies to come in.  I knew we were going to lose both Mcoms on that first set easily as our team was overmatched, so I decided to hang back with my squad and support them as a medic.

What ensued was by far the craziest point chain I've had playing BC2, I swear it ran for 3 or so minutes straight.  Started with a few teammates getting taking damage with my med pac down, them getting killed and revived, etc.  Then an enemy assault runs up the stairs, kills my squad mate, I knife the assault, revive my buddy, pick up the assault kit, toss out an ammo box, back to Medic, med pack back out.  An enemy recon runs up, knife him, same deal but now I've got a motion mine out as well, and I'm standing close enough to both the assault and recon kits that they don't go away.  What ensues is this crazy chain of switching kits and throwing out med kits, ammo packs and motion mines, while constantly rezzing my squad mates back to life.  I only killed one more enemy in the process (on an accidental defib no less), never even fired my gun, no vehicle or M-com destroys, just had this crazy run of points going from all the various support actions.  Every time it seemed like the chain was done I'd get a little +10 heal or something just at the very end to keep it going.  Eventually I got taken out and the points kept piling up, the chain didn't end until I had already respawned and was running back into B.  By that point I had 1700+ points and no one else in the game had more than 300.

Anyway, totally random and I thought I'd share.  In all my time playing before don't think I'd broken more than 900 or so in one run.  It built up so slowly and just keep going, hearing that little + points chime again and again and again had me cracking up.",,False,,t5_2rgyt,False,,,True,t3_veol4,http://www.reddit.com/r/badcompany2/comments/veol4/1470_point_chain_on_nelson_bay_rush/,

I don't go on full auto most of the time. I fire one round at a time. With Magnum Ammo, it usually only takes me 2 or 3 shots to do the job. I was getting a decent amount of head shots with it too. Doing that, accuracy is between the M1 Garand and the M14 leaning more towards the Garand. The edge is that you get a 20 round magazine and the option to go on full auto in an ""Oh Shit"" situation. I was doing well as an Assault with the G3. I rarely use the M203, so I wasn't losing much. I did like having an infinite supply of C4 since I could drop the ammo box. With C4, you can destroy tanks, which is nearly impossible with the M203. I was playing Rush today, and gave the squad attack order to MCOM A. I laid down all the C4 I had directly on the bomb (I was using the explosives upgrade + magnum ammo) and set the charge. I ran back and hid. As 4 enemies ran to defuse, I hit the detonator, killing 3, and killed the last one with the G3.

Why risk getting killed to possibly win 30 points for defusing the MCOM and 100 more for winning a game? If nobody else is defusing then you probably won't win anyway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p4fkH9qC4M

The main point of this all : you can be a terrible FPS shooter, or not know the maps at all, and still do a lot of good for your team. 

Don't like videos? Quick summary:

* 'Q' : The magic button. It spots enemies and places that red triangle above them. There is nothing that will help your team out more. If you could only shoot, or spot, but not both, you should spot. 

* But 'Q' gets better. Need ammo? Point at an assault, 'Q' will let them know you need ammo. 'Q' on a medic to request healing. 'Q' on that vehicle to request a pickup. Or to declare an objective to attack/defend.

* On the same note, try to check your minimap or flashing icons on players heads for requests they've sent to you.They may need ammo, repair, whatever. If you are on the foreign language team, the audio queue isn't obvious, you need to look for the flashing icons.. 

* Work with your squad. Try to stay together. Realize your squad is a mobile spawn point, but if you all die, you gotta spawn back at base. Sometimes the best thing you can do is sit quietly and stay alive so your squad mates can spawn on you. 

* Understand how tickets work. It is the 'score' of the game and a team loses when it reaches zero. Everytime you die, your team loses a ticket. Every time a medic revives someone, your team gains a ticket. Sometimes, its best to not respawn and just wait and hope a medic will revive you. 

* In Conquest, both sides have tickets. The team that holds less control points slowly has there ticket count decrement. However, this is slow, slow. You may lose more tickets assaulting a well defended point than you would gain by taking it over. Especially if you can't hold it. The ability to spawn on a control point your team controls is huge. 

* Rush has more complications than conquest. In rush, the offense has limited tickets. The defenders have infinite. The defense wins when they bleed out the attackers tickets.  The offense wins when they blow up the mcoms. So, don't endanger yourself unless it better fulfills the objective (blowing up the mcom). 

* Know your kit and your role. I won't elaborate much, there is plenty in the vid. Some very concise tips : 

-- Assault : Provide ammo. Use smoke grenades to create cover on offense. 

-- Engineer : Repair your teams vehicles. Blow up enemy vehicles. Blow up strong cover points or buildings where enemy is hiding behind. 

-- Medic : Revive dead teammates. Drop medkits where your team is holed up. 

-- Recon : Toss motion mines to reveal enemy movement on mini map. You'll help out a lot on the front lines. If you want to snipe thats cool, but note that if a team already has 3-4 snipers, you may not add much. Also, if you can just move up a bit into middle territory, you can help out your squad by being an advance spawn point. 

* Death before dismount. Say you drive a tank into the fray and get shot to shit. You hop out of the tank to hide in a building, or maybe try to repair it and get shot. Unless the tank is completely destroyed, the enemy can hop in it, repair it, and use it against you. Worse, your tank won't respawn back at base until the original is destroyed. This is a bad, bad, bad situation to be in. Unless you are 100% sure your team can get back in the drivers seat, its best to just die in it. Death before dismount.

C4 will switch ownership if it takes any form of damage from another person, be it gun shot or explosion. With the exception of if it takes 60 damage or greater where it will then explode. Exactly the same as what happens with AT mines.

What's interesting with C4 though, is that the ""owner"" of the device can detonate it with the use of the C4 detonator. So this means that if you have C4 on your kit, and you shoot someone else's C4 with a pistol or something, you can now detonate it using your own detonator.

While this may be far from useful. it does explain why sometimes thrown C4 will refuse to detonate, as it may have been hit by a stray bullet or damaged by an explosion. (I've actually seen C4 that I've thrown get launched further into the air by a grenade, only to not respond to the detonator.)

And on another note, with this you can control more than 6 C4 at a time. You do this by stealing ownership of other peoples C4 and by laying your own.

However, there is just one thing.
This game can be extremely frustrating to me. 

It's not that it's too hard, it's that everyone else sucks! :)
OK. Not everyone else but in BC2 I play to win the match and when my teammates start fucking around I get pist.

Things like this bother me:

* Lack of basic vehicle politeness (vehicle stealing, using helicopters as personal disposable transport)
* Players that ignore objectives completely
* Players that won't spot, EVER.
* Squadmates that enjoy putting the worst music in the world on teamspeak.
* M95-ers with 12x scopes that hide in the same bush the entire match.
* Lack of tactics (entire team attacking the same flag)
* ...

This is surprisingly useful. You can spawn right near an enemy a full five seconds after that spawn point would normally have been disabled.

I never see anyone else doing this. On the 2nd to last stage on Port Valdez as attackers, make your way along the waters edge on the left of the map.

When the land end and the concrete port begins, most people know that they can climb up those first two ladders in the water around the shipping containers into B. If you try to swim out to any ladders beyond these, you auto suicide.

What you can do, is swim to each consecutive ladder, climb up half way, jump off, swim to the next one, climb up half way, jump off, swim to the next one etc etc.

Climbing half way up the ladder (enough to get your body out of the water) resets your 'swim timer' so to speak, and as long as you go ladder to ladder you can make your way all the way around the port behind the enemy spawn by their heli. Then you hide out while your squad spawns on you, and commence ownage.

your turn.

On Isla Inocentes, on the last stage for attackers (and on the 2nd to last stage for defenders) you can scale the wall by the road to the right that goes the entire map to make your way up on to the cliffs overlooking the 2nd to last/last stage.
