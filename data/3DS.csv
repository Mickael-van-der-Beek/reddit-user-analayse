I ended up dropping $200 to replace my old 3DS with the new version, but recently I was wondering if I would run into a problem. The Fire Emblem 3DS comes with the game pre-installed but I'm planning on sending all of my data from my old 3DS to the new one. Would this delete the Fire Emblem on the new 3DS? If you're reading this thank you for listening!

I panicked because I had 42 downloaded games on it. Today, I just got them ALL back! Here's the steps I took. 

* #1. File a police report AND request a copy - You MUST file a police report or else they won't be able to give you your games back. Do it right away because it will take 3-5 business days to process. I had to file online which took a few days and then I paid 6$ for a copy to be sent to me.

* #2. Call Nintendo customer service - Find the phone # on the website.  Have the serial # of the stolen 3DS (and the replacing 3DS if you have it) and your club nintendo ID ready.

* #3. Send a copy of the police report via fax or E-mail - Make sure to write your name, telephone, 3DS serial numbers and a detailed summary along with it. 

 I faxed the report and 2 full days later they reimbursed me $195 onto my club nintendo account to buy back my games and gave me download codes for all the games I downloaded via club Nintendo rewards. Nintendo was very easy to work with through the whole process, I couldn't be happier right now, I thought all of my games were lost for good. I just hope this can save someone from losing all their games!

Success! 

I can hardly believe it, but the airline came through for us! Six days after we contacted them for help, the airline emailed us this afternoon saying they had found the owner of the wayward 3DS and had passed our contact info on to them. Not an hour later we received an email from the father of the child to whom the system belonged. Arrangements are being made to ship the 3DS back to Texas to one very happy kid!

Honestly, I had given up hope that we would be able to find the owner. I had, in fact, grown more than a little fond of the 3DS and was a teeny tiny bit sad to let it go. So you know what I did? I marched out and bought myself a brand new one just for me. Kid's happy, I'm happy; everyone wins!

Now I need friends and games (my friend code is in my flair). I bought TLoZ: OoT and I'm absolutely loving it.

1375939287.0,255,self.3DS,1jxsdk,3DS has sold 32.8 million units before the first major Pokemon release. Not bad!,Lord_Yupa,315,60,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1jxsdk/3ds_has_sold_328_million_units_before_the_first/,"At two and a half years old, the 3DS has sold 32.8M units. In the same time frame, the DS had already sold roughly 15 M units more by mid 2007. The difference is that the DS had already seen its first major Pokemon release a year earlier in 2006. A year on the shelves with a hot new Pokemon sitting next to it does wonders for a console's health, not to mention getting a brand new Zelda game in the same window.

In other words, I'm extremely optimistic for this little handheld. Nintendo has consistently impressed me with their output for this system - the games feel polished and complete, whereas on the DS and GBA there seemed to be a much higher amount of ports and second-rate titles. The only things I'm left wishing for at this point are a brand new Advance Wars game and since Super Nintendo classics are getting sequels, how about Super Metroid 2?

Good job Nintendo, now fix the Wii U : ) Hey, maybe put that Super Metroid 2 on Wii U instead. 3DS doesn't really need any more help right now.",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,False,,,True,t3_1jxsdk,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1jxsdk/3ds_has_sold_328_million_units_before_the_first/,

I'm really worried that the shaking in my pocket is hard on my 3ds.

If Nintendo were to make a pokewalker sized pedometer that I could carry with me, that counted steps and got streetpasse a then 'uploaded' when it was within streetpass range of my 3dd, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.  It's also mean I could wear sweats/gym shorts while jogging instead of cargo shorts. 

I think anywhere from $15-30 would be a fair price. 

Would anyone else really like this or am I unique in this interest?

EDIT: 

Two things:  

1) phone app would be okay, but I'd rather have a lighter load when jogging and not bring my phone either.

2) my 3ds is now 'losing' the sd card (giving me the message that it's been removed when it's still in) and I think shaking around in my pocket is what caused it

EDIT 2: apparently it's not just me, now to figure out how to tell Nintendo that we want this.

It clearly belonged to a child, as every function I can find has a parental lock on it. It was found on a plane and we are contacting the airline to see if they can somehow find the owner, but I thought maybe you guys could give me some tips on what to do.

The bad news is that the charger is missing, so the more I turn it on and look around, the closer I am to the thing running out of juice and being no help at all. 

Any help would be appreciated!

EDIT:

I have contacted both Nintendo and the airline of the plane the DS was found on. Nintendo couldn't help me as the DS was never registered, nor does it have any accounts linked to it. I have not heard back from the airline.

I DID get Nintendo to help me remove the parental controls so I could dig around and see what I could find. Unfortunately it wasn't terribly helpful. There are no saved accounts aside from the basic name/birthday/state listed on the Streetpass.

Here's what I know:

The child who owned this 3DS is elementary school aged and male. He is latino, as is his mother. The name he listed on the streetpass is ""monkey"" and his birthday is 2/16. His home state is listed as Texas.

I have pictures of him, his mother, a man I assume is his father, and a pair of older folks who are probably his grandparents. I popped the SD card out and dug around on it. I found some audio recordings, only two of which have voices, and both seem to be his mother talking to someone else. I was hoping she would talk to the boy and maybe I could get a name, but no luck. I have searched the backgrounds of all the pictures for clues, but couldn't find anything useful.

I hesitate to post a child's picture on the internet, even for a good cause. I'm not sure what else to do, now. Still waiting for info from the airline.

Some of the best graphics I've seen on 3DS, and the sound design is up there with some of the most atmospheric I've heard from Nintendo. Charles Martinet really brought his A game in how he brings Luigi to life with a lot more than the usual ""Woo hoo!"" Really perfect music and sound effects, too. 

Plug in some good earphones for this one, turn out the lights, and crank the 3D up to MAX. Only a few hours in, but I think this one is going to go straight into the 3DS Hall of Fame with Super Mario 3D Land and Animal Crossing New Leaf. 

It's a great time to be a 3DS owner, that's for sure. 

Anyway, sorry to gush, but I just had to share, I'm so excited about this game! Feel free to ask any questions if you want and I'll try my best. I'm playing the Japanese version, but I doubt they can really be any different with release dates only a couple of days apart.

Thus said, I'd love Nintendo to add a few features that would make this handheld even better. 

1. Better use of the IR. It's there, and there isn't a single game that I know of that can use it. The 3DS is begging for a  universal remote controller app; I had one on my GBC back in the day with the Mission: Impossible game, and I don't see why we can't have that again.

2. Friend to Friend messaging. Yes, there's Swapnote, but if I'm in the middle of a Mario Kart session online, waiting for a match to start and I and I see JoBlo from England is online, just browsing the eShop. I want to say ""hey, let's play Mario Kart"", then jump back into my game. I don't want to close MK, launch Swapnote, send a message, close it, then go back to Mario Kart. Too many steps between me and sweet sweet online gaming goodness with my friends.

3. Some sort of notification center that pops up in game. The blinking green/blue/orange light is nice, but I'd like to know more without having to go to Home. Maybe a little popup at the top of the touchscreen that says what's going on; JoBlo is online playing Mario Kart. JohnSmith has just sent you a message. There's a new update available. Whatever.

Games like Donkey Kong 64, Pokemon Stadium and Snap, Kirby, Majora's Mask, etc.. (Maybe not all classic, but some very good ones in my opinion)

Did they say they would ever do that? I think the nostalgia factor (and the fact that they are actually good games) would make these all sell like hot cakes.  How hard would it even be to port these?

My personal opinion is yes, they should definitely port these. Not only to help sales, but to increase customer satisfaction. Look how awesome the Ocarina of Time was!

1370741870.0,180,self.3DS,1fyi7u,A new (temporary) submission policy pertaining to Animal Crossing submissions on /r/3DS,Kuiper,234,54,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1fyi7u/a_new_temporary_submission_policy_pertaining_to/,"As most of you are probably aware, tomorrow marks the North American release of Animal Crossing: New Leaf.  /r/3DS is intended as a venue for content and discussion related to the 3DS platform, and of course AC:NL falls under that, being a 3DS game.  However, in order to keep /r/3DS as a subreddit that is interesting and relevant to a broader audience of 3DS owners, we want to prevent it from being inundated with certain types of content.  Earlier this week, when the review embargo for Animal Crossing: New Leaf was lifted, over half of the front page of /r/3DS was filled with AC:NL posts, and we expect that the volume of Animal Crossing submissions will only increase once the game has been released. Consequently, we are instituting a new temporary submission guideline (read below for an explanation):

&gt;Please avoid submitting the following:

&gt;* Submissions which are not created to provide/acquire information or generate meaningful discussion (e.g. ""HYPE"" threads)
&gt;* Submissions which presume either ownership of or familiarity with an Animal Crossing game
&gt;* Submissions which pertain directly to specific portions of AC:NL's content (user-generated or otherwise)

Everything else is fair game.

To provide a better picture of what kind of posts the new policy is intended to achieve, here are some examples of submissions that would NOT be allowed on /r/3DS:

* ""Who else is totally psyched up to pick up their copy of AC:NL?""
* ""AC:NL owners, exchange friend codes here!""
* ""I created a hilarious costume for my Animal Crossing character (links to screenshots inside)""
* ""What's your favorite furniture set in AC:NL?""
* ""I discovered a fast way to harvest fruit in AC:NL (video)""

Some alternative venues for these types of posts include /r/3dsFCswap (for swapping friend codes), and /r/AnimalCrossing (for discussion of any and all games in the Animal Crossing franchise, including New Leaf).  And as always, /r/casualnintendo exists for things like funny screenshots.

Some examples of submissions that *are* allowed on /r/3DS:

* ""SuperAwesomeGameStore is offering 10% off purchases of AC:NL!""
* ""GameReviewerDude's review of AC:NL is up""
* ""Interview: Animal Crossing producer Katsuya Eguchi discusses how he achieved his creative vision with Animal Crossing: New Leaf""
* ""Animal Crossing: New Leaf sells over 600,000 copies during launch week""

In general, we recommend that before posting Animal Crossing-related content to /r/3DS, you ask yourself the question, ""Would this content be interesting or useful to someone who do not own and has never played Animal Crossing?""  If the answer is ""no,"" then perhaps your submission is better suited to a subreddit like /r/animalcrossing.

Do note that this is a *temporary* submission guideline, which we will lift when we deem that is no longer necessary (as described below); we expect this period to last for about 1-2 weeks, but it may be lifted sooner or later as circumstances dictate.

Having your submission removed as part of this new submission policy is not considered a punitive measure.  We will remove posts which we believe break these submission guidelines (and encourage users to report submissions which they believe violate these submission guidelines), but there will be no ""penalty"" for those who break these submission guidelines, except for users who do so in a repeated and deliberate manner.",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,False,,,True,t3_1fyi7u,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1fyi7u/a_new_temporary_submission_policy_pertaining_to/,moderator

""Now the most well-known adventure game in the world comes alive in the new 3D version of this Classic Story!""

This statement obviously implies that the game is in 3D. There is absolutely no 3D to be found in this game.

However, this isn't the most glaring inaccuracy on the page- The biggest problem here is that the video clearly shows the playable area of the game on the bottom screen (which would make a lot of sense considering the game is a point and click adventure)- implying that the stylus is used for gameplay. Not only that- but the menu bar along the bottom of the game screen seems to suggest that this isn't even video from this game! That menu bar is never seen in the actual game.

Example #1 from e-shop video: http://i.imgur.com/tGhmO.jpg

Example #2 from e-shop video: http://i.imgur.com/iScpm.jpg

In-game screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/idIOX.jpg

As you can see from the e-shop video; they are clearly misleading customers into thinking the game is played on the bottom screen. This would seem logical and in fact was a selling point for me. They made the size of the top screen displaying ""MYST"" the same aspect ratio as the 3DS top screen, and the bottom screen to match- there was an obvious intent for it to appear this way. However, as you can see from the in-game screenshot this is simply not the case. Instead, you have to control the pointer with the circle-pad which makes it basically unplayable- it's basically taking the raw input from the joystick and plopping it on the screen- if you release the stick- the cursor goes to the middle of the screen.

I don't have a problem shelling out $30 for a mediocre game, but I do have a big problem with being mislead and deceived on the Nintendo e-shop. In my opinion- this should be Nintendo's responsibility to ensure the content advertising the game is at the very least accurate. 

I've e-mailed Nintendo about this... shame on the developers.",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,False,,,True,t3_149v7n,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/149v7n/psa_myst_3ds/,

After a few minutes the train pulled up, and I hopped on. A few hours later, on the return trip, I went into my bag to get my 3DS out and it wasn't there. Checked my bag, coat, and all my pockets. It. Was. Gone. :(

I must have left it on the bench I was sitting on, or on my seat on the train.

Either way, the dude is lost and I can't exactly afford to buy another one right now. It was an Aqua Blue ambassador system, with some of those games having a lot of progress. I'll be contacting the lost and found of the train station tomorrow, but I'm not expecting anyone to have turned it in in this city.

So now my favorite game and handheld are gone. I had over 50 hours in Harvest Moon, and was planning on wifi'ing the game with my friend when I went home for the holidays (we can't seem to get online working). That won't be happening for a long time now. I suspect I'll have to wait until I'm employed again, and at that point I'll probably wait for the 3DS Lite or something to come out. 

It was fun while it lasted and I'm very bummed. I was hoping to introduce my girlfriend to Animal Crossing when it releases as she doesn't play many games, and I think she'd *really love* that game. That will have to come later.

Let this serve as a reminder to all of you - I implore you all to double check you have everything with you when getting up from your seat somewhere.

1367741295.0,137,self.3DS,1dq2ab,Anyone else think Super Mario 3D Land is both amazing and disappointing?,thebesticando,181,44,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1dq2ab/anyone_else_think_super_mario_3d_land_is_both/,"(SPOILERS AHEAD) I say this as a big Nintendo fan, I just completed Super Mario 3D Land 100% and while it was amazing, it was still a bit disappointing. I'll give some brief reasons below. There will be spoilers so be warned! 

 - The overworld was very basic, nothing like Super Mario World or Super Mario Bros 3. 
 - The special stages were not very special. Some were pretty challenging, but all unoriginal. They were just previous stages with harder enemies, then a timer, then evil mario, then evil mario and a timer. 
 - The method to 100% was pretty tedious. Having collected all the star coins in every level, I thought that would of been 100%. Having to finish every level with a gold pole and both Mario bros was just time consuming, not fun. 
 - The P-wing. I never saw a P-wing until a mystery box had one in it, when I used it during a level I was shocked to see it was just a menu asking me to go to the end of a level. The P-Wing in SMB3 was one of the greatest items in the Mario series, so to see it again in SM3DL was great, just unfortunately disappointing. 
 - Not enough levels, while the Special stages did add length to the game, having five or so courses for a world seemed short. 

I REALLY hope we see a Super Mario 3D Land 2, because it could really be an amazing game. Think of a Super Mario World overworld, special exists in stages, more levels, a proper hidden/secret/final world, A PROPER P-WING. 

I'm a huge Mario fan and this game was great, I completely understand that they wanted a game on release or a Mario game to start the 3DS series, I just hope they revisit the idea and improve on it. Super Mario World and SMB3 are two of the greatest Mario games, with good reasons. The elements that made those games amazing didn't exist in this game at all. I didn't feel a sense of adventure at all, just ""next stage, next stage, next stage, etc"". Also, none of the ""New Super Mario Bros"" games do it for me. The visuals and music all seem so bland to me, I played the DS version and it wasn't that great to be honest. 

What do you guys think? I might be too critical about it, but I'm just a huge fan :D ",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,False,,,True,t3_1dq2ab,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1dq2ab/anyone_else_think_super_mario_3d_land_is_both/,

Personally, I would really want that. The trophy system really extends the gameplay on some pretty mediocre games on the PS3/Vita for me and it makes me feel like I got my whole money's worth from those otherwise mediocre games. And it also gets a lot more time from good games as well, such as Persona 4 or Wipeout. I mean, Gamefreak already has done this with the medal system in the new Pokemon games, and for me, it helped get a lot more gameplay out of them. Maybe Nintendo could just encourage their devs to support one internally, like Gamefreak, so they won't have to do it themselves?  But, this is most likely a moot dream since Nintendo is pretty stubborn. Like the title says, would you like to see one?

Here is a link to [the original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1ep1gh/here_is_a_new_r3ds_survey_it_is_more/).

Here's a [**large pic that summarizes the responses**](http://i.imgur.com/gm3bhEr.png). (I used [tinypng.org](http://tinypng.org/) to compress the .PNG so imgur wouldn't turn it into an ugly .JPG)

I also have a spreadsheet with every individual response timestamped and recorded for detailed analysis, but it's a little hard to get through the 2831 (!!!) responses. Here's a link to [an html version of the spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AjKLYoU2qkiDdGtZcG5xR2Rtc1o4RkRxczM4M04zYXc&amp;output=html). I've also uploaded the spreadsheet to [mega](https://mega.co.nz/#!8YR3TZRI!SFcCJyiZRu2inEdkNzMLZzDDwNcuRxJkqMUrGxKFPFI
) and [mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/download/a7w0se1nxfpslhg/5-20-2013_r3DS_Survey_Responses.xlsx). Let me know if you want the spreadsheet and aren't happy with the file hosts I've chosen.

Here are some thoughts on the questions:

**What is your biological sex?**

Yeah, I should've worded this question better. I liked /u/ftmk's suggestion: Are you a boy or a girl? But I think even that is potentially marginalizing. I think a solution might be this: What's your favorite color? Blue? Pink? Green? No other choices. 

Anyway, it's clear there are more people here with an X and a Y than there are with two Xs. No surprise there really.

**How many years have you been alive?**

I separated ages into what I considered major ""eras in life"", but didn't take into account that, for example, having 18 and 21 separate from 19-20 means the data would of course show way more 19-20 year olds. Still, it's not too difficult to add the results up and see that 18-21 year olds make up about 35% of the responses. About 10% of the responses were from people above 30. I'm not counting the few who answered &gt;70 — I suspect those responses are from pranksters. I also noticed that if you were exactly 70 years old, the way I had my answers set up meant you couldn't answer the question. Sorry if this excluded any 70 year olds.

**What region is your 3DS?**

I should have split this up into two questions. ""What region is your 3DS?"" and ""What region are you?"" 

3 of the China responses match up with people who also responded they were &gt;70 years old so. . . I'm not thinking we had any Chinese responders.

**Which 3DS do you own?**

Taking into account those who sold/traded their 3DS and now have a 3DS XL, it looks like the subreddit is about evenly split between the two models. About 10% have both.

**When did you buy your 3DS?**

I was surprised at how evenly these responses were spread. However, notice about 20% have bought their 3DS after March 2013, a much shorter period than the other choices. Sales have really picked up this year!

**Which of these Nintendo gaming systems have you owned?**

Shout out to /u/supermanhat who owns a Virtual Boy! Sorry I forgot about it. The graph shows this question's responses well. Thanks to /u/Supermegapig for correcting the percentages for these responses:

|||
:---|:---
| NES   | 43%
| SNES   | 49%
| N64   | 67%
| Gamecube   | 71%
| Wii   | 72%
| Wii U   | 23%
| Game Boy   | 47%
| Game Boy Color   | 70%
| Game Boy Advance   | 67%
| Game Boy Advance SP   | 60%
| Game Boy Micro   | 9%
| Nintendo DS   | 58%
| Nintendo DS Lite   | 59%
| Nintendo DSi   | 25%
| Nintendo DSi XL   | 9%
| None   | 1%

**What upcoming 3DS release are you most looking forward to?**

I think the most popular write-in here was Super Smash Bros. Yeah, not sure how that one slipped my mind. I was a little surprised that X/Y hype beat out Animal Crossing, considering how close we are to New Leaf's release (June 9 NA and June 16 EU!).

**What is your current favorite 3DS game?**

I would recommend any future survey/poll avoid write-in responses as much as possible.  They're hard to see. It would've been better to try to include as many games as possible as choices. Of the 400ish write-ins to this question, there were a little over 100 Ocarina of Time 3DS responses, some Harvest Moon: A New Beginning, Star Fox 64 3DS, some Theatrhythm, 1 Pokemon Dream Radar, 3 Ghost Recons, some Tales of the Abyss, a good amount of Kingdom Hearts, 1 Rayman 3D, some SMT:DSO and Soul Hackers, 2 Cave Story 3D, 3 Tetris: Axis, 2 Rhythm Thief, and ***1 Cooking Mama*** (how cute are you?).

**What is your favorite Nintendo franchise?**

I forgot F-Zero, but it had 4 write-ins. Lots of Zelda and Pokemon. Not surprising considering how amazing those series are. Someone said Picross was their favorite game and franchise. That seems hardcore in a way.

**What are you doing with your life?**

No, really, *what are you doing with your life?*

**How Many StreetPass tags have you collected?**

The amount of responders with over 3000 StreetPasses suspiciously matches up with the amount of responders over 70 years old. . . plus one. So I think one responder is for real, but the rest are probably pranksters. Anyway, I think the data shows that the majority of people who take their 3DSs with them on the go have a good amount of StreetPasses. 390 people said they didn't usually carry their 3DS, and 543 have 0 StreetPasses, so that's only around 150 people who are carrying their 3DSs and not getting Passed.

**Do you know someone, besides yourself, who owns a 3DS in real life?**

I'm jelly! I don't know anyone who does, but a large majority of this subreddit does.

**How important is it to you that your digital purchases are tied to an account and not just your system?**

No surprise here, 80% want accounts! /u/TechMoments pointed out a bias in this question: "". . .not *just* your system?"" I think it would have worked better had I taken out the last part of the question: ""How important is it to you that your digital purchases are tied to an account?""

**Do you usually take your 3DS with you on the go?**

Happy to see most of us do. To those of you who don't: get hip to it!

**What do you most want?**

Most of us just want to be happy. I was happy to see that ""I want to be famous"" and ""I want more power"" were the least popular. Not that there's anything wrong with those responses — we need famous and powerful people! But most of us seem to have our egos in check.

**Would you rather live. . .**

It looks like most of /r/3DS wants to live in the city. You can have a city. Why don't you take it!? You're gonna make it after all! I guess it makes sense: more people means more people to StreetPass. Besides, if you want a quiet small town, there's always Animal Crossing right?

**What's your favorite thing?**

This is the EarthBound question.

**Have you looked at the [/r/3DS FAQ on the sidebar of /r/3DS](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/wiki/faq)?**

Imagine an /r/3DS with no redundant threads. 49% of us already have.

Just wanted to say that we have not ever removed or censored a post directly due to it being about flashcarts or circumvention of the 3ds firmware. It's quite related to the sub-reddit and unless links to roms start getting tossed about, I doubt any one would care. 

For the record, when the 3ds gets popped open I'll be the first to start developing homebrew on that beast. So please, downvote away, but stop reporting peoples links and every comment about carts, it's just a waste of time we generally let votes do the talking there, and lots of respected users here have carts. 

You may now go back to playing zelda and donkey kong jr. :P


EDIT: Some of you seem unable to read. Allow me to re-iterate. I am not announcing that we are free to share links and spread the word about piracy. I am stating that flashcarts and homebrew are perfectly legit topics. Most of you seem to get the picture here, but some of you seem to simply enjoy reading your own comments. If people were linking roms on the subreddit (which they aren't cause you know, we moderate it and all..) then you would have a legitimate reason to report it.

Like it says: 

Feel free to ask me my opinion on any of the games. Hopefully this can help you decide your next purchase :)

Edit: I am a pretty serious gamer, but enjoy something casual now and then. I don't have a huge genre preference. I play on a regular 3DS.

5 is not an average game (it was given to Sonic Colors due to it being a very bland-feeling Sonic game, and to 50 Classic Games 3D due to it's sheer lack of longevity or multiplayer). It just means I didn't enjoy it for very long, as it didn't have enough to interest me, or just had flaws that I wasn't fond of. A perfect 10 would be a game that holds my interest, is incredibly fun, and maybe a minor issue or two that are not really detrimental. I would have given Monster Hunter a 10, if the 3DS version had online.

I do not use Circle Pad Pro on anything.

All my ratings are on the game itself, not in comparison, or an average score. It is based on how well the game keeps me entertained, how much enjoyment I get out of it, overall satisfaction, and a little bit on the graphics. Sorry to use broad terms.

So, I just moved in for college last week and am living in just a standard dorm hall (I actually got lucky and got one of the nice ones but that's beside the point). Anyway, I've been here for about a week and classes started on Monday. I've been bringing my 3DS around with me pretty much everywhere since StreetPasses are pretty rare where I'm from. Well, I keep passing this one girl and have been just about every day. It's actually pretty cool knowing you're going by this same person, have been exchanging messages with them, and yet have no idea who they are. After passing this person like three times she sends me a personal greeting.
 

""*Dorm buddies? :)*""

 
Huh, cool.
So the next day I pass by again (I think our rooms might be within range of each other anyway), and due to the low character limit, I reply with simply 
 

""*Maybe. 1516?*"" (name of the dorm hall).

 
So I wait another day, and another StreetPass goes by.
 

""*Yepp! 1516! :)*""
 

Cool, so we're in the same building. I need to make some friends here anyway.
 
Hmm, what should I reply with now? I fumble around with it for a minute and don't know what to say. I decide to press back and exit out of the typing screen for a second, just to look at her reply again.
 
""*Yepp! 1516! :)*"", her character replies again. I have no idea what to say. It wouldn't make sense to ask her what her name is since it says right there. I don't want to come off as creepy either, considering she just said we're in the same dorm and likely just a floor under each other. I guess I'll just go back to the typing screen...

 
Shit... I press the wrong button. I accidentally give her my general greeting instead. What now? She just told me we were in the same dorm together, right? What was my reply again?

 
**""*My body is ready*""**

1372097180.0,110,self.3DS,1gzddo,PSA: This week is your last chance to hit Gold or Platinum on Club Nintendo!,zman2100,136,26,190,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1gzddo/psa_this_week_is_your_last_chance_to_hit_gold_or/,"EDIT: This pertains to North American Club Nintendo, not Europe or Australia

As many know, the Club Nintendo year runs from July 1st until June 30th, so this is the last week to register games to get coins that will count toward this year's elite statuses (300 coins gets you Gold status, 600 coins gets you Platinum status).

So if you've got some 3DS games you haven't registered yet, go ahead and do it if it will push you to the next level! Otherwise, I'd hold onto those codes until July to get a good start on the next year.

EDIT 2: For North Americans, here's how Club Nintendo works:

* Create an account at [Club Nintendo](https://club.nintendo.com/)

* When you buy a console or game, register it on Club Nintendo with the PIN card that comes in box. The PIN card is red and white and says ""Club Nintendo"" on it. Some 3rd party titles don't have PIN codes.

* Once you've registered the console/game PIN code, take the registration survey. When you've completed the survey you will be rewarded coins and points. Typically it's 160 coins/points for consoles and 40 coins/points for a retail game. Some games give a bonus of 10 coins/points if you register them within the first few weeks of it's launch, and some games have pre-purchase surveys that give you another bonus 10 coins/points if you end up buying the game when it's released.

* A week after registering the game, a post-play survey will become available and you'll be able to earn another 10 coins/points for completing it.

* Make sure to link your Club Nintendo account to your console so that eShop purchases can earn you coins and points as well. This can be done from the Settings menu in the eShop.

* Coins earned allow you to buy reward items from the Club Nintendo catalog. **Coins are good for 2 years before they expire. They will rollover into the next Club Nintendo year unless they are old.**

* Points go toward your elite status; Between July 1st and June 30th, if you earn 300 points you'll reach Gold status, and if you earn 600 total points you'll reach Platinum status. When the new year begins on July 1st, your points reset.

* Gold and Platinum status means that Nintendo will offer you your choice of reward for free; you won't have to spend your coins on it. Platinum members will have a greater choice of better items than Gold.

I hope that clears things up a bit for those unfamiliar with Club Nintendo. Basically, you want to try to hit Gold or Platinum status so you can get a bonus free reward without spending any coins. If you can't hit those levels this week, then save your codes to register them in July so you'll have a good start to the next year and can hit the elite status in 2014.",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,1372108065.0,,,True,t3_1gzddo,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1gzddo/psa_this_week_is_your_last_chance_to_hit_gold_or/,

My fears was completely wrong. This game is fantastic and nothing short of a masterpiece for the 3DS. Seeing as this was developed by Sora I can see Super Smash Bros. Brawl's general feel of being a completionist trying to acquire everything. The amount of content packing into this game is amazing and the replay-ability level is extremely high. It really saddens me that I have to return it and don't have the money to keep the rental. So if anyone was on the fence about this title, don't rent it! It's really worth the purchase.

Edit: I forgot to mention the music and voice acting is superb as well. Some may be taken back from the dialogue from the characters but I feel it adds a lot of personality to the game. You actually become interested in what the characters have to say and how they bounce jokes and insults off of each other.

Anytime you enter the water in MK7 and find yourself floating towards the bottom, hold up on the circle pad. This puts you in a nosedive towards the bottom, giving a massive speed boost and a huge advantage over everyone else.

You'd think that this trick would be surprisingly well-known by now, but from what I've played online it doesn't seem to be. Using this technique, I'm able to reliably get 1st place almost every time on a water map when playing online, even against opponents with a high skill level. This works well in all of the water levels, but it kills in Wario Shipyard especially.

The intention of this post is to give people an honest alternative opinion on Animal Crossing. This subreddit has a very positive view of Animal Crossing and that is what led me to pick the game up. It was not for me. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game. However, it will not appeal to everyone. For those who have played the game, **please feel free to correct me on any objective inaccuracies so that the comments can be a good resource for potential buyers** and not an unhelpful shouting contest. **I'm basing my opinions on limited play of Animal Crossing: Wild World for the DS.** This took place a few months ago (long after there would be much activity online, I didn't even try out the online aspects).

**Anyway, I  was looking for a laid back game where I could accomplish tasks without a sense of urgency.** I was also interested in interactions with the NPCs (if you look in my history you can see the post I made asking for info before buying the game). The NPCs were far less interesting than I had hoped. Most of them said one thing all day. They would occasionally engage you in a challenge or invite themselves over to your house at a certain time in the future. The reward for completing a challenge was something like furniture or money. It didn't feel very rewarding, but then again I'm not sure what I expected. Having the NPCs invite themselves over was not very interesting either. I tried to get them to come over to my house immediately but they insisted in (IIRC) at least an hour's time between talking to them and having them come over. I couldn't bring myself to play for that long, or to come back to my 3DS after that period of time. It didn't feel like it was worth the effort. There are also NPCs or events that are only available on certain days (one of them was an art dealer IIRC) and for the same reason I just didn't feel any motivation to set aside time on the specific days to talk to these people or compete in these events. Another specific event thing that irritated me was that if you didn't check up on people for a few days or week they might leave. There was a duck that lived nearby that got ill so I bought him medicine on multiple occasions and he thanked me even though he was still sick. After I took a week off he left the town. It felt like the things I did do didn't matter, and the things I didn't do mattered more.

My initial interest was based around the NPCs but **the collectibles also failed to impress me.** You collect fish, insects, fossils, shells, and art. These can be sold or put on display in the museum. Collecting (especially fish and bugs) was interesting at first but quickly became boring when I realized that the money felt pointless (explained later), the museum seemed pointless, and I would have to play the game at certain times or days to collect everything. It seemed to be based on chance and time commitment. If I could suggest one thing in this area (however implausible) it would be a lot more interesting if collectibles required some creative or resourceful thinking. Maybe to find a special fish you could use certain bait or use a technique that maybe an NPC could clue you in on. Perhaps this was already implemented and I just didn't have the patience to look into it. I just wish that collecting was more about thinking or exploring than collecting everything that randomly spawns at the given time that you walk out your front door.

**The last nail in the coffin was customizing the house.** This was the thing that I was least interested in from the get go but at this point I was desperate to squeeze some enjoyment out of this game. I don't understand why a lot of Japanese games have customizable houses. I just must be one of the few people who don't find that interesting. You start out with a small house. If you pay a certain amount of money to Tom Nook you can increase the size of your house. At this point, I was bored with the rest of the game so decided to work towards this goal. I spent a lot of time grinding by collecting and selling all the collectibles. When I had finally made enough money, I paid off Tom Nook and ran home, excited to plan how I would use the extra space. After all of that tedious work, the house had increased from 4x4 to 6x6. I was pissed. This seemed completely disproportionate to the grinding it required. I guess I expected another room. This change allowed for one or two extra pieces of furniture.

There doesn't seem to be a good length of time to play. I get bored if I play for a long period of time. However, if I don't play once a day to talk to people (so they don't leave), weed, and grind for money it feels like I will be punished. It seems like a chore.


I was done with the game. I picked up Harvest Moon: A New Beginning. I haven't played it much but what little I have played has been much more like what I had originally wanted from Animal Crossing.  Time does not pass in between sessions so there is no false sense of urgency to pick up and play. I think the more structured task of tending to crops and later selling them appeals to me a lot more than collecting random objects.

**TL;DR**

**1) I found the NPC interaction shallow and uninteresting**

**2) The persistent world (time continues between play sessions) makes the world less laid back than it seems. Spend too much time away and weeds will grow and citizens that you like may leave.**

**3) The collectible are based on random chance and time commitment. It feels like a grind**

**4) You have to raise a large amount of money to increase the size of your house just a little.**

**5) Long play sessions get boring. The game seems to encourage short (around 15 min) play sessions daily to avoid consequences. It feels more like a chore than entertainment.**

**6) Animal Crossing is not a bad game but it is not for everyone. If you were drawn to Animal Crossing but this review has raised some red flags, you might want to look into a different game like Harvest Moon: A New Beginning. For me, it was a lot more entertaining because time didn't pass between play sessions (more laid back) and growing crops was more structured and gave more of a sense of progress.**",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,1361157385.0,,,True,t3_18q5l9,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/18q5l9/why_animal_crossing_might_not_be_for_you/,

The listing can be found [here.](http://www.frys.com/product/6952137;jsessionid=T8GopoynlAiL9dTnce1rpQ__.node1?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG)  I showed them the page on my phone.


They told me that they will price match fry's offer as long as it matches the product 100%.  Yes, I walked out of the store with a pink 3DS.  I was going to take it to a different target tomorrow and exchange for a different color, but I got impatient and opened it anyway.

I found this on slickdeals, where the guy went to 2 Best Buys, 2 wal marts, 1 k-mart, and finally the target that price matched it for him.  I went to best buy and was declined then walked next door to target and was unboxing my new 3DS 20 minutes later.  They had never even heard of Fry's (none around me), yet they matched it without much problem at all.  Your mileage may vary.  Perhaps I was lucky, but if you live near a target and are hurting for a 3DS it may be worth your time to give it a shot.

First of all, yes, I know it's not an XL and deals on non XL's aren't that big of a deal around here.  But, I just bought a used 3DS from cowboom for the exact same price last week.  This may be good for those looking for a deal or those that would like a backup.

It was $108 after tax for me (In Louisiana).

**3DS Retail Download**

* *Animal Crossing: New Leaf* (Nintendo, $34.99) — Because of its ""real time"" gameplay, which rewards checking in often, *Animal Crossing: New Leaf* is ideally suited for a digital eShop download (IMO). Its download size is slight for a retail game at just over 6000 blocks. Reviews have been [very positive](http://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/animal-crossing-new-leaf/critic-reviews); although the game is perhaps not as innovative as its name suggests, this *Animal Crossing* is, apparently, more charming than ever. Download it midnight June 9.

Everyone's trying so goddamned hard to be Yahtzee Croshaw. Everytime a game has a single goddamn fault, it's slammed by the community. It sickens me to see this level of immaturity in a subculture I once considered myself proud to be a part of.

That said, the controls for Kid Icarus aren't bad. They're ""Metroid Prime Hunters"" controls. Need I remind everyone that every DS system in 2004 was sold with a Metroid Prime Hunters demo? I loved that demo, it's what convinced me to buy the system. No one bitched about the one handed controls then. These controls are identical. The only difference is that the 3DS is SMALLER than the original DS phat, thus making it actually more comfortable to play than Metroid Prime Hunters.

There was a stand included for the same reason nintendo released the circle pad pro; they heard all the ""hardcore gamers"" whining about how this sucks and that sucks, and they're TRYING to appease people. 

I tell you, the end of gaming won't come by some government legislature or unfair law;  it'll come because everyone will be fucking complaining about EVERY GAME THAT IS RELEASED because they want to be seen as callous, complex in their tastes, and hardcore.

Fuck the haters. I'm loving this game and you will too, if you liked metroid prime hunters.

ALSO, voice acting. It's great to see nintendo FINALLY start using it more and more. I was so shocked to see it in Metroid Prime 3, and Other M, and the banter between Pit and Palutena really livens up their characters!",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,False,,,True,t3_ra2ua,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/ra2ua/i_just_purchased_kid_icarus_uprising_and_im_here/,

As a member of the press I've got a review copy; for the sake of the embargo this has to be considered a ""preview"". To keep it short: Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is really damned fun. As an early adopter of the GCN I enjoyed Luigi's Mansion but always felt it was missing... something. I could never really put my finger on it. Well, whatever it was, that feeling is gone with Dark Moon: it feels like an important Nintendo game, filling Luigi out as a character, and offering enough of a challenge to keep me coming back. 

The game has a mission-based structure that allows you to replay levels to try to beat your previous score, catching more ghosts, finding more cash and gems, and searching for Boo ghosts that can be a right pain to catch. 

There are plenty of hidden passageways, nooks, and crannies to find, and exploring rooms again after you've found power-ups can give you access to new rooms, cash and other stuff. 

I haven't even tried out multiplayer yet, but I think it's going to be fun. 

Anyway, I think it's a safe buy for anyone who liked the first one, or anyone looking for a fun action-puzzler. It looks like there's going to be a fair amount of replayability here because of the multiplayer and the option to go back and beat your own high scores. 

If you've got questions about the game I can try to answer them, assuming they don't break the embargo.

I just got off the phone with a customer service representative when I called to inquire about my Castlevania pre-order and was told that they have no idea when they'll get any stock in and that it may be weeks before they do.  I read previous stories in r/3DS about people having the same issue with Fire Emblem Awakening, but I assumed that it was because of Fire Emblem's short supply/popularity.  I ended up cancelling the whole order because even after speaking with a supervisor I was told that they would not be able to honor the discounted price in store.  Because of the lackluster reviews anyway, I decided to ultimately wait on purchasing the game because of the potential for a price-drop/sale within a few weeks.

1325483183.0,93,self.3DS,nzgh4,We're kicking off the new year with a /r/3DS community experiment (new submission rules).,Kuiper,108,15,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/nzgh4/were_kicking_off_the_new_year_with_a_r3ds/,"First, business.  Our new submissions policy (which you can also view in the sidebar to your right) is as follows:

&gt;Please avoid submitting:

&gt;* Memes / Rage Comics.
&gt;* Pictures not directly related to the 3DS system or games for the 3DS
&gt;* Nintendo stuff not related to the 3DS (try /r/nintendo instead)

Offending posts will be removed as they come up.  If you'd like to lend us a hand, you can use the report function to report any posts that you believe are in violation of this new policy.  We plan to rigidly enforce this for the next week, from January 1 to January 7.  This is an idea that we've been murmuring about in the moderator staff room for quite some time, and we thought it was time to formally put it into practice.

If you have complaints or criticisms of this policy, please bear with us for the coming week.  For now, it's a provisional policy being implemented on an experimental basis.  One week from now, we'll open the discussion up to the community and see whether we want to adopt this as permanent policy or go back to the old ways.

-----

Now that that's out of the way, onto more fun things.  There is a pretty big change in the 3DS community that started a week ago: it grew!  Mysteriously, our subscriber total began rapidly rising on December 25.  We can only assume that this is linked to a spike in the number of 3DS owners, although we're currently baffled about why the number of 3DS owners should suddenly spike on this particular date.

The surge in activity (all starting in the mysterious and cryptic date of December 25) has put us well over the 4k subscriber mark, which is something of a milestone.  In fact, it seems that this community has started growing legs and increasing the size of its turf.  Swapping friend codes has become such a common activity that it now has its own dedicated subreddit, located over at /r/3dsFCswap.  (We apologize to those users who have had problems with our 3DS friend code bot--rest assured that we are working toward a solution.)  There are also a number of 3DS-related subreddits dedicated to specific games, like /r/Swapnote, /r/Pushmo, and /r/MK7RC.  This list is expanding all the time, so for the latest, be sure to keep your eye on the sidebar located to your right.

This year has not been without its ups and downs, but at the end of the year, can any of us say we truly regret owning a 3DS?  Regardless of whether you're an ambassador or a week-old Christmas 3DS owner, when we have titles like Animal Crossing, Kingdom Hearts, Kid Icarus, Metal Gear Solid, Monster Hunter, Paper Mario, and Professor Layton all looming on the horizon, there is no doubt an amazing year ahead, and I personally cannot wait to see the amazing things that the reddit 3DS community has in store.  /r/3DS wouldn't be the subreddit that it is without you guys.  Here's to the new year!",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,False,,,True,t3_nzgh4,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/nzgh4/were_kicking_off_the_new_year_with_a_r3ds/,moderator

Nintendo is probably the MOST under-wraps game company. Valve lets out more info about future projects than Nintendo, even.

If you can't find a release date, it doesn't have one yet.

If it's a feature you want, no one knows if Nintendo is planning it

If it's a remake you want, no one knows if Nintendo is planning it.

If it's a new color, no one knows if it will ever be made.

You only get the 160 coins from registering the console itself.

I have no idea why they won't register Animal Crossing onto my account... one of the main reasons I register my products is so that I have it listed *somewhere* that I bought them. Not to mention I can't provide any feedback on the game despite having spent the extra money for the console/game bundle. I sent the rep. another email asking why they don't register Animal Crossing and I'll edit this post when I get a response...

EDIT: Apparently they *can't* register any pre-installed games onto Club Nintendo, but at least the game itself is recorded on the serial number of the 3DS so it is recorded just in case you lose or damage your console. Still unfortunate that I lost out on about 60 coins though... I figure this is good to know for anyone looking at buying bundle deals in the future or were unsure of why Animal Crossing didn't register on their accounts.

While we're unable to reinstate an expired survey  (which earns you Coins), this will not prevent you from being eligible for the $30 Nintendo eShop credit.

So it looks like even if you forgot the registration survey you are still set and will be eligible as long as the other conditions are met

I've put 25 hours into the game so far, and it is one of those rare games that I'll play late into the night and then wake up early in the morning because I'm so excited to play it, that hasn't happened to me for a long time.

I have started by playing through on the easiest difficult on the mode where your characters deaths aren't persistent, which feels great for newcomers, and its a nice way to ease you into the gameplay. I definitely plan to do a second playthrough on higher difficulties though.

The story is fantastic and always has me needed to know what happens next, the gameplay is extremely addicting, a strategy game mixed with an RPG progression system with interesting characters. 

I don't want to ramble on too much, but if you are at all on the fence about getting this game, it's definitely worth it and you won't regret it.

I finally decided to buy a 3DS now that the Midnight Purple colour has been released. Once Future Shop had opened today, I walked in and bought one. On the way out, I noticed a sign that said I was supposed to get the game Spirit Camera with my purchase. I walked back into the Future Shop and found the guy who rang me in and asked about the game. He said ""Oh right, sorry about that, they're giving away some crap game with the system. Do you want it?"" I asked if I could have a game that wasn't crap instead, but he said he couldn't do that. Spirit Camera was listed at $20 in Future Shop. He did a bunch of customer service stuff and handed me a copy of the game.
             
Once I was back in my car, I noticed that there were no Future Shop tags on the game. Then, an evil thought occurred to me. What if I brought this unopened game to Walmart and asked them for an return? Walmart is only across the street, so I drive over and take Spirit Camera into the building. Before I returned it, I walked down to the game section to see what Walmart is selling it for. Turns out to be $40 plus tax.
           
Back at customer service, I ask the lady at the desk if she can do an exchange with no receipt. She says it won't be a problem at all and that she'll just have to give me a gift card. I agree and she hands me a gift card for the the $40 plus tax. After that, I walked back down to the game section and bought Kid Icarus. The guy at the register was a bit confused that my gift card had the exact amount of change that was necessary for the purchase, but he didn't really give a shit.
               
I suppose I just wanted to tell my story. However, if anyone in Canada is planning on buying a purple 3DS, you can do some swapping in order to get a good game. It's very likely that you'll be committing some sort of fraud. However, you're not signing your name to anything, so you should be fine.
          
Huzzah! Kid Icarus is awesome!

It's more than worth the 8 dollars price tag.

Petit Computer is a DSi/3DS app that lets you create your own programs/games using the BASIC programming language. While it doesn't have any kind of tutorial, it DOES include a comprehensive manual that explains what each command does and how to create your own sprites/backgrounds/music.

It has been out in Japan for about a year now, so there are a lot of demonstration videos on Youtube.

Petit Computer also has a unique feature that allows you to create a QR code of your program so you can share it with other people, which is why I feel it's very appropriate to create a subreddit for Petit Computer (/r/petitcomputer) so everyone can share their programs.

I have a 3DS case that I got when I bought this game last week. I don't need it, so I thought I would give it away for free to some lucky /r/3ds user.

[Here are some pictures so that everyone knows what I'm talking about.](http://imgur.com/a/15o04)

I will choose a random user in about one hour after this post. Just post something inside this thread in order to participate. 

Keep in mind that I live in Switzerland, so if you live outside Europe it might take around 3 to 7 days for the mail to reach you.

Good Luck!

Edit: It's only the Super Mario case, not the 3DS console!

For anyone interested in taking a break from any new 3DS games you may have received over the holidays, the rules are simple: Post a link to your Steam wishlist in the comments below. On Friday at 2pm ET, I'll pick a random winner, and I'll buy you a game from your wishlist!

**The fine print:**

* I am only buying games on Steam. Do not post links to an Amazon wishlist or ask for eShop codes.
* While I don't want to set a dollar limit on the prize, don't stuff your wishlist with $60 games.
* An additional 'entry' can be earned by writing an *insightful* (read: not half-assed) review of a 3DS game. Once written, submit the review as a self-post to /r/3DS. Provide a link to the post in the same comment as your original entry. I'm trying to add additional content to our [RedditReview list](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/tza06/official_r3ds_redditreview_content_list/), and I see this as a good opportunity to obtain more reviews.
* RULE ADDITION (EDIT): Your Steam account must appear to be 'valid' in order to be eligible to win. This is usually enforced via account creation date, but since it's possible that people created accounts yesterday for new computer gifts/purchases, I will allow new accounts to be used *if their libraries contain at least $50 worth of activated games.* Thanks /u/sietai :)

**Best of luck!**

***

**UPDATE ON THE CONTEST WINNER!**

The results are in, and after random selection, /u/JustLookWhoItIs is the lucky the winner of the contest! I will be sending JustLookWhoItIs a PM on Reddit with further details on the distribution of his prize! Also, [since his wishlist consisted of a whopping 1 game](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/15h2tg/to_those_of_you_on_r3ds_who_also_game_on_the_pc/c7mjdys), he will be receiving a copy of [Spec Ops: The Line](http://store.steampowered.com/app/50300/)!

Additional shout-outs go to Redditors /u/rmw6190 and /u/sietai, as both used this post to give away additional free games! Thanks for the generosity!

I finished the game with all K-O-N-G pieces unlocked, and I completed the bonus levels. I have yet to complete time trial, mirror mode, and collect all the puzzle pieces (finishing mirror mode gets you 200% completion). This has taken me 20 hours, and (holy shit I just realized this game came out 3 days ago and I've spent 20 hours playing it already) the challenge is what made this game so satisfying. Please don't play new mode. You will finish the game too quickly.

Anyway, I'm sure a lot of you are getting tired of hearing about this game in this subreddit: so go and buy it! If you like platforming, there is no reason you shouldn't.

I guess im wondering if this is a known issue or did I actually get a defective copy?

**update** so I tried the cartridge on my old regular 3ds and it loads the level without any issues yet it still crashes on the new 3dsxl. So far this is the only game ive had an issue with but im nervous that maybe my xl is bad. Any insight would be appreciated because I really dont wanna have to figure out how im going to be able to exchange this where I bought it since I doubt they are gonna let me sit at customer service and do a system transfer

**final update** so I beat the level on the original 3ds and put it back in my xl. At first the problem persisted, however when I loaded the level for time attack mode it did load just fine. And after that it now loads the level normally too. This is the weirdest thing I've ever experienced with Nintendo hardware but it seems to be fine now.

I visited Kyoto (a small town) and managed 10 street passes every day, however in Tokyo it was insane. I reckon  I got a minimum of 10 street passes an hour. I would check my 3DS, bring the people in from the gate (10 is the maximum in one go) and would already have 2 or 3 people who had passed me in those couple of minutes.

I just thought it was pretty interesting how many people use the 3DS there. I live and study in central London and the most people I've street-passed in a day is something like 4.

My mayor character equipped his spade without going to a menu. I pressed down and he put it away. Continually hitting right or left rotated through his equipment. Finally a way to avoid getting stung by bees that the DS version would have greatly benefited from. This is the best feature. 

Another great feature is the ability to fill in holes or rub out tiles with the Y-button. 
Edit: you don't need anything equipped you just kick sand.

You can take screen-caps by pressing L and R-shoulder buttons at the same time. 

Mushroom collecting for more bells. 

The 3D is crisp and really draws me into the game. 

The village map seems smaller than the DS version, but it feels just right since they added all the shops in the arcade. 

Floating presents now appear on the play screen (which is the upper 3D screen) so they're easier to find and shoot.

The map is always on and you can tap a location and it stays highlighted as a type of guidance.

**3DS eShop**

* *The Starship Damrey* (Level-5, $7.99) — After last week's epic psyche-out, the first of the Guild02 titles arrives this week, and it's the adventure/exploration title from Kazuya Asano and Takemaru Abiko. You awaken on the named starship with no memory of who you are or how you came to be there, and you have to explore and figure out your environment without any hints or tips to guide you. 

* *Swords &amp; Soldiers 3D* (CIRCLE Entertainment, $6.99) — CIRCLE has stepped in to port Ronimo Games' excellent side-scrolling real-time strategy title, which originally became a favourite on WiiWare. With quirky humour, solid challenge and a decent amount of content, we're hopeful that stylus controls will improve on the solid pointer controls of the Wii title. 

* *Bowling Bonanza* (Enjoy Gaming, $5.99) — If you've had enough of those smelly bowling alley shoes, this may give you the chance to get a frame in whenever you feel like going for some strikes. The blurb for this title promises much, with hot-seat multiplayer, a rating system, four modes and ten alleys to choose from, among other things. We'll see whether it's the Kingpin of the genre in our upcoming review.
Dress to Play: Magic Bubbles! (EnjoyUp Games, $3.99) — This is the second entry in this series, where you go from dressing up your avatar of choice to playing a different game in order to unlock more outfits and goodies. This time around the secondary game appears to be a match-puzzle affair.

**3DS Virtual Console**

* *Mega Man 5* (Capcom, $4.99) — Isn't it about time you buy another NES Mega Man re-release? With the Blue Bomber now starting his assault on the Wii U eShop, we still have the completion of his 3DS roll-out to finish, and we're now approaching the end of this particular run. While fans will argue over the best of the NES classics, we still believe this is a thoroughly excellent game in our Wii Virtual Console Mega Man review. 

* *Harvest Moon* (Natsume, $4.99) — After a bit of a delay from the European release, The Game Boy Color debut for this popular series finally arrives on the North American Virtual Console. It has a decent amount of the farming simulation gameplay that's so well known, though we did feel that a little too much had been stripped away from the home console equivalents in our Harvest Moon review.

1364949637.0,66,self.3DS,1bjzay,It's the little things that matter the most- Why I love Dark Moon.,Ikeezy,86,20,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1bjzay/its_the_little_things_that_matter_the_most_why_i/,"Despite the game being about ghosts in haunted mansions, I constantly find myself chuckling and smiling while playing this game. I haven't beaten it yet (about to finish the Secret Mine), but I can already tell I'll be back for more after I beat the game.

-The writing is fantastic. The professor cracks a lot of subtle jokes and puns. I was afraid I was going to be turned off by the mission system at first, but E. Gadd's dialogue (and Luigi's reactions to what he says) is witty and entertaining. It keeps the downtime just as entertaining as the actual missions.

-That brings me to the mission structure itself. It's very convenient, especially on a portable system. It's going to make going back and completing the game 100% after the final boss much... less frustrating. I don't think it'll makes it easier per se, but at least the game keeps track of Boos and your 1/2/3 star rating on the mission screen. Adding the graphics with the gems to each mansion's mission select screen would have been a nice bonus, but I understand that they're meant to be difficult to track down.

-Luigi: What he lacks in dialogue, he makes up for in personality. The shrieks, yells, humming, etc. all adds tremendously to the overall experience. 

My most memorable moment (so far) is in the Secret Mine when Luigi finds the first set of teleporters. His reaction is priceless. Trembling, he cowers in front of the machine before cautiously poking it with a finger, and eventually sticks his whole arm through. He's relieved to see it coming out of the other teleporter, smiles, and then starts waving at himself. ""Hello? Hello! Hello. Hello! It's me!""

This game is about going slow, exploring, and paying attention to details. Both details in game, such as hidden treasure, and details about the game itself, like the ones that I've mentioned. Dark Moon is skyrocketing to the top of my activity log, and this is why. I can crank up the 3D, plug in my headphones, and just get lost in the game. It's one of the few games where I can honestly say that I feel like a kid again when I'm playing it. I could go on and on about the puzzles and gameplay, but it's the little things that really make this game shine.

EDIT: One final thing that I think really adds to the sense of mystery and exploration are the security camera images, and getting to look at them and hear E. Gadd's input. They give just enough detail to get you excited for what's ahead, without spoiling anything. Very well done. Going along with that, being able to peek into rooms and see how the ghosts act when Luigi isn't around (and their reactions when they do notice him!) adds a level of depth that most games can't even hope to achieve.",,False,self,t5_2ruhy,1364951049.0,,,True,t3_1bjzay,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1bjzay/its_the_little_things_that_matter_the_most_why_i/,

Yes I understand some people have a hard time holding it for more than an hour, but then use the the stand. I know that may effect the portability, but you are missing out on a truly epic game. I have been playing through the first three levels over in over because of the rewards for increasing the difficulty, and weapon fusion. The game is deep.

I haven't even delved into the online, and I'm already loving it. Let me also say this. You can say what you want about hand cramping(Which for me are worse in MK7), but the controls are fluid and smooth. When ever I get hurt it is my mistake. Also, I need to mention the voice acting. It is no cheesier than Mortal Kombat's on the ps3, but in this case it's on purpose, and is hilarious/charming.

So what I'm saying is don't be fooled out of some of the best fun available on 3ds. If you're still not sold, please check out the video I provide of level 2, which is all kinds of epic.

Thoughts inside...",fearofthesky,80,12,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/lbycy/i_played_demos_of_mario_kart_7_kid_icarus/,"Hey /r/3DS! Nintendo has been holding events in shopping centres around Australia recently, which I had no idea of until my partner called me today and told me that there was a whole bunch of 3DSs and Wiis clustered in the middle of the shopping centre she works at. So I went down and checked it out and lo and behold! Demos of three of the most anticipated 3DS games, plus Zelda: Skyward Sword for Wii. 

Thought I'd share some of my impressions of the three games for y'all...

**Kid Icarus: Uprising**

Three levels were on show, but I only got to play the first two as I had to get my girlfriend to the bank before it closed. The on rails gameplay reminded me very much of Panzer Dragoon Orta, and if you've played that gem, you know that's high praise. The controls were fluid and the stylus-driven aiming smooth. You get a choice of seven weapons before each level, and the gameplay seemed very intuitive Basically, you hold the left trigger for quick fire, but stopping fire for a sec while holding down the reticule on an enemy for a sec before firing lets out a heavy shot, usually obliterating the creepy looking sonsofbitches. Dodging fire is a blast, too. The Kid is very nimble and you usually get a small window to flick the slide pad to avoid enemy fire. 

What I wasn't expecting ere the on foot sections, which also arm the Kid with a melee weapon for a bit of up close smackdown. The graphics were beautiful, detailed and with good use of the 3D. Flying above the river vista in the second level evoked an out loud ""wow"" from this cynical gamer, so needless to say I was impressed. 

There was also an AR card demo set up on one of the Icarus units, where two characters come to life and smash the crud out of each other. Some of the younger kids were amazed by it, but when I mentioned they may do something like this for Pokemon, they got really excited! Hope I didn't get their hopes up over nothing haha. 

**Mario Kart 7** 

Just one course here on show here, but it really showed off the inventive course design Mario Kart is known for. You go flying off a boost pad off a cliff early on, only to have a hang glider pop from your kart and catch the breeze, sending you through a mess of pipes and collectible coins (oh, coins are back, but I'm not too sure what purpose they serve yet), reminding me instantly of Pilotwings Resort. 

You continue on up a *very* sheer rock face after landing, propelled only by boost pads while you dodge falling boulders. Great use of the 3D here too! If the course design keeps to such high standards throughout the game, Nintendo may be onto another winner here. I just hope they include an item switch and the ability to disable item rubber-banding this time. I didn't get Blue-shelled in my 3 or four races, which I was happy about! 



**Super Mario 3D Land**

Wow. Fantastic. I was a bit worried about this one. I thought it may be an unoriginal rehash of Galaxy but I needn't have worried. I became concious after about 5 minutes of play that I was grinning like an idiot in a Nintendo ad the whole time! 

much of the game is reminiscent of a side scrolling Mario, only with a little bit of depth in the play field. When you go down a pipe however, the angle switches to 45 degrees, and you can really see the depth of the 3D effect. This is used very cleverly for a few of the jumping sections! Star Coins were scattered through the 4 levels, and getting to them required addition dexterity. One thing I missed though was the backflip from Mario 64 (the triggers crouch, but alas, no backflip when you hit A). The return of Raccoon Mario made up for that though! 

Additionally, they organizers had a Nintendo Quiz, with some tricky Zelda related questions. I didn't get any of them (they were all about The Minish Cap, which I played so long ago I can't remember much about) but when they switched to Mario, they guy asked ""Which of the original NES Mario games did *not* feature Bowser as a boss? I put my hand up, the guy picked me and I answered ""Super Mario Bros. 2"" and I won a Zelda OOT3D lanyard, keyring and Ocarina! I've been tootling on the Ocarina all afternoon, driving the GF nuts in the process! :) 

I also got to share some Nintendo wisdom with some of the young teens there (I'm 27). I enthusiastically pimped LoZ OOT3D when one kid playing it seemed cynical about it. I asked him what games he normally plays and he said Call of Duty. As I groaned inwardly, he told me that he loves Mario too, and that you ""gotta love Mario!""

Bought a little happiness to my heart there. 

**TL;DR The future of 3DS is bright**

Why don't we have something like our top 10 games on the side bar, like they do over in [r/boardgames](http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames). We could have a post every month or two where we all vote for games to make the top ten and simply upvote those games we love. The top 10 then would be added to the sidebar, and maybe could be linked to reviews and what not (I have no idea if this is easy to do).

We could also do different top 10s (eShop, 3DS, DS) if we want.

1356809037.0,64,self.3DS,15mvta,3DS: There's just something about it. (long read),ericargyle,98,34,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/15mvta/3ds_theres_just_something_about_it_long_read/,"So I'm wondering why there is this stigma involved when someone mentions the 3DS?  People tend to judge this system more than any other one I've seen, and I've been in this game (no pun intended) for 31 years.  They write off the 3D as a gimmick, and talk about Nintendo having lost their way.  I can't but help think the complete opposite.  I'll get down to it in a moment, but first, a bit of history on my part.

I started gaming at 5 with Karateka on my Atari 7800.  I then moved up to Mario Bros and Kid Icarus at 7, Mario World and Super Metroid at 12, Mario 64 and Goldenye at 15, and finally Final Fantasy X and SOCOM II at 22, along with everything in between.  These were great systems, great platforms, and they were always offering something new; from colorful responsive platforming, to a true 3D polygonal experience, 4 player multiplayer on the same box, and networked gaming with people from around the world.  There was always something new and exciting around the corner, and it was happening on the games themselves, not on the boxes or the peripherals.  Then came the Wii and the Playstation 3 when I was 25, and I just stopped.  

Blame this partly on life, partly on getting married, having our first child, etc.... but moreso, I blame it on the fact that those systems got stale, WERE stale even out of the box.  The Wii to me WAS a gimmick, a fad, something that should have been sold for $50 for the sports bundle, and Nintendo should have continued to make a real system with more traditional controls for their flagship titles.  I ended up giving up on gaming for a few years due to my dissatisfaction at the direction the controls took. After awhile, in 2010, I thought I'd give the Wii a second shot and attempted playing Zelda: Twilight Princess and Metroid: Other M, and even then my 2 year old looked at me like I was a lunatic, and I just wasn't enjoying myself dancing around trying to kill the enemies.  I put down the controller, and haven't touched the Wii since.

PS3 was a similar, yet different story.  PS3 was simply more of the same, better graphics, same exact controls, etc. etc. etc.  Normally this would be all good in my book (as with the new 2D Mario games), but so many times I saw the plot and gameplay suffer simply to spend more time on making the game look pretty.  There's nothing I can think of I've even demo'd on the PS3 that sticks in my memory as a moment of gaming greatness.

Moving on to the 3DS.  Last Christmas, at the age of 30, and without even asking or knowing anything about the 3DS, my mother gifts me this little black system with Mario 3D land.  I boot it up and I am amazed, simply amazed.  The fact that I got the same feeling that I got while playing Mario 64 for the first time 15 years prior was astounding.  The graphics I was seeing, the fluidity of the gameplay, and the depth that was added with the 3D effect was awesome.  It was something that actually added a lot to the game itself.  I proceeded to put 24 hours into that game alone in the first month alone, more than I've played any game in that timeframe in the last 10 years.  Since then I've picked up Mario Kart 7, Zelda OOT, Kid Icarus Uprising, New Super Mario Bros 2, and Paper Mario Sticker star.  Each one of these has enjoyed thorough playtime, and I just received Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy Theatrerythym for Christmas.

The difference I find in the 3DS is that it is the system I actually talk about publically, and reccomend to friends and family.  I just bought a red one with Mario 3d Land installed for my wife, for Animal Crossing, which we're both highly looking forward to.  To me, the thing with the 3DS is that I feel like it's the perfect mix of all the gaming that I've experienced in my life. It has the pure fun factor the older consoles offered, not so complicated, not so gimmicky, but with the added depth, network support, and controls that the newer systems can offer, without even mentioning the portability.  I know people complain the eShop doesn't have enough games, and that they only release a few each week, but again, it's like the old days.  The waiting to me is enjoyable.  You get excited about a game coming out (I was excited about Super Mario Bros. 2 NES releasing all week), you talk about it on these forums, and read up on it.  I can't tell you how much I read up on Mutant Mudds, and Sakura Samurai prior to their release.  This is opposed to the instant gratification of having every single title in history and then some, and being overwhelmed with choice.  To me, this is a plus.  I also enjoy that I don't need added peripherals, or add-ons to enjoy the console.  Funnily enough, I see the same sentiments being said by 19, and 28 year olds on this same subreddit, so it seems to be commonplace.  There's just something ABOUT the 3DS that tugs at the heartstrings like no other system has in many, many years.

I firmly believe the 3DS is the best system out now, and I see myself getting more excited about the games that are coming out for it than anything I can remember since the early days of the gamecube.  Luigi's Mansion, Castlevania, Animal Crossing, and Smash Bros. will all offer something new and unique and at the same time familiar and comfortable that makes you remember why Nintendo has always been the company to beat when it comes to gaming.  I feel like a kid again when I'm playing it.


tldr:  The 3DS  judged unfairly by people who've never used it, but there's something about it that hits on the gaming roots of veteran (read: older) gamers.  I firmly believe it's the best system out now and I see myself more excited about the games that are coming out for it than anything I can remember since the early days of the gamecube.

At the time I didn't think to file a police report because I honestly didn't think I would ever see it again. about a month ago I went ahead and replaced that 3ds with another one since there are more solid games out now and then just 2 days ago traded that in and got a 3dsXL. 

I went to register my XL on the Club Nintendo website and noticed that my original 3ds serial was saved from when I registered that so I emailed Nintendo and told them what happened and posted both serials in the email to see if there was a chance I could enjoy the ambassador program because I never got to before.

Initially they told me that if I emailed them a copy of the police report they would be happy to help me out. I told them that I never did that because I didn't think it would help. After a few emails exchanges later
and honestly thinking I wasn't going to get it because of the police report, the Nintendo rep told me to call them and explain my situation to them, which I did. 

After about a 30 minute phone call the person told me they wasn't going to be able to help me with much without a police report as not to damage the integrity of the program (which I understood) but said to give me a minute while he talked to his supervisor. When he came back on he said that his supervisor understood my situation and as a one time deal he would send the 'Nintendo Admins' my information and they would issue me an eShop code to unlock the program on my 3ds.

Its things like this that have kept me buying Nintendo products for as long as I could remember. Sure it was my fault and I honestly didn't think I was going to get it. But they worked with me and it was win win for both. I get to enjoy the 20 free games the program offers original 3ds owners and they continue having me as a happy customer! (even though I would probably still be buying their products if they denied me)

I’ll play something, regret the lost time, regret the lost money, and then regret purchasing the system as a kind of container for the aggregated remorse.  To compare, Super Mario Land 3D’s hunger for batteries is eternal; it’s like the Sinistar of batteries.  I play these batteries down to the nub; I don’t even notice the blinking red light.  It’s like that.  The charger is right there, it would take a fraction of a second to plug it in.  I only know the battery has run out when both screens go dark.

So I was looking for some good games that featured 2 player that were cheap. I'd prefer not to buy two copies of a a full price title, although we do often pick up both versions of Pokemon so we can trade the game specific pokemon.

**Update:** Picked up a single copy of Animal Crossing for her since that's her thing. I am going to try it out on her game and see if it's something I could get into. then maybe after payday I'll pick up a copy for myself. Really interested in Mario Kart 7 and Resident Evil.
