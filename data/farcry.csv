All the talk about whether Vaas was wasted or not. I think as a character he was wasted, but I think there's deeper meaning to it all that just clicked with me when I re-read that quote. It all makes sense now. Vaas had to die. This quote made me think; what had to happen? If Vaas hadn't died, we wouldn't have had to go after Hoyt and would've ended up staying a wimpy little Californian kid who couldn't hack it in the jungle.

So, Vaas was killed, and he was reborn; as Jason. Jason became the madman he needed to be to survive in the jungle and become top dog. He became king and nobody can question him anymore, so maybe he'll do the exact same to some extreme holiday makers someday.. who knows? Make sense?

First, there was a leopard stalking me so I was booking it along a somewhat tall cliff. All of a sudden he jumps out and comes rushing me so I turn to shoot him but I'm just not fast enough, but he runs right past me and goes after a goat that was behind me. The goat was standing along the cliff and started running as well but the leopard turned to hamstring him and got him, and the goat died, but the leopard was moving too fast and went right off the cliff. I walked up to the edge to look where he landed and get his pelt, but he had landed in the passenger seat of a car at the base of the cliff and died looking like he wanted to go out for a drive.


The second, I was driving away from a group of pirates trying to survive in one of the small sedans that are littered around. This time I was near the top of a mountain trying to get away and lost control of the car after they rammed me and went right over the side of the mountain. The car starts flying down the side of the cliff and flips ejecting me from my seat, but I somehow ended up on top of the now upside-down car, and ended up riding it like a snowboard the whole way down the mountainside until it slid to a stop at the bottom.

1358724434.0,66,self.farcry,16yebh,My alternate idea of the storyline for everyone disappointed in the last half of Far Cry 3 (SPOILERS,wint3r,94,28,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/16yebh/my_alternate_idea_of_the_storyline_for_everyone/,"Hey Reddit.


Lots of you, including myself, were disappointed with the ending that the writers gave us. We wanted more Vaas, and we wanted a big revelation or twist. The game hinted at more. From the menus to the Alice in Wonderland quotes, it always seemed that there was something just out of reach that we didn’t understand. The damn game description says that the island “Holds a dark secret”. Problem is, the end didn’t really address any of that.


So, I thought to myself, “What would I have done differently: with Ubisoft’s resources, and that stellar cast?” Here’s what I came up with:


The game opens the same way. That speech was harrowing and gripping, and will prominently remain in my memory as one of my all time favorite gaming moments as far as story is concerned. Get rid of Hoyt, though. He isn’t there to boss Vaas around.


After you break out, and get out onto the island, you do everything the exact same way, all the way up until the fight scene with Vaas. Instead of killing him with the knife, you shoot him in the head when he holds the gun to it and asks you to, and he dies.


You pick up the knife and begin to walk away, but (insert eyes opening scene here) he stands up and gives another speech. At this point you’re still in the dream sequence, and he says:


“Jason! You fuck! You didn’t really think it would be that easy did you? Look at my fucking arm. Look at this. See this? See this ink? Now look at your arm. Looks the same, doesn’t it? Now how does that work? You’ll have to find out for me. Because, actually, I don’t know. But! I know what it means.”


“You can’t die on this island. That’s thanks to Citra. Thanks to my FUCKING SISTER! You, and I, and Citra, and whoever else comes along and gets tatted up with that fucking magic ink because they think they can stop me. It’s like a little fucking circus. But you know who owns this shit, Jason? Me. I own this island. And no matter how many times you die, how many times I die, or how many times you think you’ve escaped or won, you haven’t. I will be there Jason. I own you. (The following is actually a quote from Vaas the first time he tries to kill you in the fire) ‘It’s really too bad that Citra had to ink you up, because now the only way to kill you is to erase you completely.’”
“Don’t believe me? Aren’t you having trouble keeping your memories straight? Haven’t I killed you three times already, just this week? (reference to the intro sequence plus the drug sequence, plus your miraculous survivals).


“So go! Conquer the fucking island. Take everything. Hunt the animals. Find the hidden secrets. See how long it lasts. Shoot me again! Why not? Just to see what happens. Play my game, Jason, and see if you can win this time (homage to the writers who reference the game through Buck). (The following is another direct quote from Vaas in the dream sequence) “The world is on a diagonal. I am the balancing point. Take me into your heart. Accept me as your savior. Nail me to the fucking cross and let me be REBORN!”


“See that knife, Jason? Let me show you what this fucking knife does.” Then he walks up, takes it from you because you’re too stunned to respond, and stabs you in the chest with it, like he initially did when you walked in and he says peekaboo.


You fall down, dead.


The intro sequence starts again, and then Vaas starts to deliver the exact same speech he did before. The differences you notice, as the camera pans, are three: One, your tatau is still there. Two, Vaas has the same tatau as you. Three, Vaas’ scar that he has had from the beginning matches exactly where you JUST shot him to kill him.
As he delivers the speech he stops abruptly, right after he says, “What do we have here? Grant… and, Jason”. As he looks at you he bursts out laughing. He then says, “This is just too fucking funny. Look at you there, tied up again and confused. Look at this guy! (He directs the previous statement to the guard nearby). I’m just fucking with you man.”


“Hey, hey Jason. Hahahaha. Do you know what the definition of insanity is? Here, check this out.” He pulls out his gun and shoots Grant again. “Look at that, there’s your brother, dead again. Here, you know what? I’ll let you out. And to save you the trouble of rounding up your friends, I’ll just send them over to that fucking doctor’s house again. Because I’m a nice guy, right? Of course I am. I’ll make it that easy for you. And I won’t even kill them before I send them over this time. Maybe next time, but not this time. Think of it as a gift. You can send me a thank you post card from… hmm… oh that’s right! MY FUCKING ISLAND. Get out, Jason. Go… Are you fucking deaf! Run, forrest, run!”


You run into the forest, and your map is the same as it was when you died. Continuity established.


I can definitely go further write up my idea of a conclusion for you guys, which I haven’t fully thought over, but I wanted to see if there was any interest in this post first or if you guys even liked my idea. I’m absolutely positive there are things overlooked that you can pick apart, and feel free to do so, but I like this story much better in my own head and I’m certainly not saying you have to.

Personally. Having played the whole game and done EVERYTHING before I beat the last mission(relics, letters, outposts, the whole she-bang) I was fucking pissed at the endings.

I chose the ""save your friends"" option and then later watched the other ending on YouTube and I can honestly say what the fuck. 

First off. The whole game you work to become less of a bible-humping-vagina than you are at the beginning and I can honestly say the transition from total-puss-cake to hardcore-jungle-badass is VERY well done. We slowly see Jason go from being scared and alone to a warrior with an unyielding resolve to save his friends and avenge his dead family members. 

But there lies the problem. By the end of the game you've murdered HUNDREDS  of people who Jason himself says deserve it. You've worked to free these people from their oppression and have become a part of their tribe. 

So the issue is: if you choose the ""save"" option you throw down the knife and tell Citra you want ""no more violence"" and that you've ""killed enough"" even though five minutes ago you were happy as hell lighting an entire small army on fire with a flamethrower and blowing helicopters out of the sky. And then your friends leave you on the island BY YOUR OWN REQUEST because you've ""become a monster and can't return because the anger is still there"" WTF are you angry at Jason?!

And then there's the ""kill"" ending... hoooooly shit this one is fucking weird. Not only has this bitch already raped you once after she got you high on some kind of crazy jungle potion but then for some reason you're suddenly okay with it and grunting and groaning on top of her while she talks to you the whole time about her tribe. Obviously Jason is a shitty lover because that bitch never even flinches as he's screwing her. And then it happens. BAM! Ancient knife through the chest. Even though Jason has been beat, stabbed, shot, fallen off cliffs, mauled by wild animals and LIT ON FUCKING FIRE this bitch suddenly one-shot-360-yolo-dropshot-swag-scopes your ass with a knife after she tells you she loves you. 

I get the theme of the game is the slow decent to madness. And I get the whole getting-your-ass-kicked-and-living thing is for gameplay purposes but SERIOUSLY? C'mon Ubisoft. 

But then again that's just my opinion. So I want to know yours. Tell me what you guys thought of the endings!

TL;DR: I fucking hate both endings, Jason reverts to being a pussy and Citra's a bitch.  What do you think? ",,False,self,t5_2st42,False,,,True,t3_15rhua,http://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/15rhua/what_do_we_think_of_the_endings_spoilers_obviously/,

+ I'm feeling more of that stealth vibe as well, with bushes providing almost invisible cover like in AC. Takedown assassinations (from air and behind, and from a cliff/ledge).

+ BUT! One HUGE DIFFERENCE, is Crafting in FC3, is ACTUALLY USED! Unlike AC3 pile of shit crafting system! So happy they didn't share that IDEA to the detail!

Anyone else spotting similarities? 

I personally think it's good and for the best, but just something I noticed and thought I'd see if anyone else feels the same. Adds a new flavor to the FC series IMHO.

I can admit when I'm wrong, and boy was I ever wrong.

The matchmaking system takes forever to find a game, and sometimes leaves you sitting in a lobby alone besides the fact that there are hundreds of games happening in the playlist you chose.

The only way to play public games on custom maps is through the rating system, which means you don't get to choose what maps to play, or by choosing a map and playing a custom game on it, which no one can see in a list of lobbies or join without an invite or by coincidence. 

You gave us an amazing game with an amazing and powerful map editor, and a fun multiplayer, but the multiplayer server situation is seriously broken. Far Cry 3 will most likely lose most players if there is no easy way to host and play on a rotation of chosen user made maps, that is what made Far Cry 2 fun.""

1354422029.0,33,self.farcry,144xqo,Four days of playing on highest difficulty... a few thoughts on improving the game.,st-augustine,53,20,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/144xqo/four_days_of_playing_on_highest_difficulty_a_few/,"I really enjoyed Far Cry 2 - except for the infinitely respawning guardposts and the occasional stealth issues.  (Most of the time I found stealth to be accurately difficult...sometimes it was ridiculous how they'd find you in the dark from 200 yards away....)  I liked the dark plot, the war-torn African environment, the tension between violence-as-solution and violence begetting more violence.

So far...

**I'm enjoying Far Cry 3.  It's fun.  I'm having a blast.**

...

But there are a few things that are driving me crazy. Mostly it all falls under ""hand-holding.""  I wish the game was more challenging.  As it is, even with the massive sandbox and countless things to do - each of those things is a series of connect-the-dots.  

* Minimap - I just wish it could be turned off.  It removes too much challenge.  I wouldn't know which way an enemy is facing behind a wall in a firefight.  I wouldn't know which boxes contained valuable loot.  I wouldn't know where every useful plant is in a square mile.  I *loved* the map and compass in FC2.  I with every game had it.  It's my dream mod for Skyrim - a map that I have to equip in one of my hands, an equip-able compass.  I wish that were the case in FC3.

* Glowing *everythings* - Again, loot boxes, plants, ammo.  It's so silly.  These are things I should have to *hunt* for.  Skyrim at least had plants that blend in with the world, and if you learn what they look like, then you have some useful knowledge you can put to use to help you in the game.  Again, Skyrim barrels and boxes, some have loot, some don't, but they're not glowing and blinking.  You have to put some effort into it.  These are sad design choices, I guess to appeal to 12-year old players, but I'd love a hardcore mode that turns them off.

* Handholding in quests - I'll try not to spoil it... but in one quest you're given a special compass that is supposed to lead you somewhere.  Instead of using the compass, the next location just magically appears on the map - and worse - your questlog pops up with the *name* of the person you need to talk to when you get there.  How would I know that!? - and then, later in that quest, there is a puzzle to reach a ledge that is too high.... and instead of having me figure it out, each and every step appears as a pop-up with glowing blinking lights to show me the way.  It would have been such a cool challenge, except that it was on-screen ""do this, now this, now this.""  I kind of miss Myst-type games, where you could legitimately be *stuck* for an hour trying to figure out what to do to meet a goal or where to go next.  FC3 would be a far greater challenge with some mystery and problem-solving added.  Or not added even... just take away the hand-holding.

* Characters - FC2 had dark conflicted characters.  These are all a bit cartoony and one-dimensional.  FC2 had fantastic strong women.  These women are all sorority-girl bimbos or island-fantasy sex dolls.  Too bad.  Having a choice between male or female protagonists would have been nice, too.  Anyway - because the characters feel so unlikeable.... it kind of takes away my motivation to rescue them.  I get that they're ""Jason's"" friends... but ""I"" as the player don't feel any urgent need to rescue them.

* Reward balance - For most of the game my ""wallet"" has been full.  I loot everything... and I'm constantly too rich.  I've run out of things to buy, I've crafted everything I can, and I have too much money and nothing to do with it.  Not an uncommon problem in games, but too bad.  It'd be nice to have something to put money into... a house on the island with upgrades, or more weapon upgrades, or something.  I like the perk tree system...it's a nice addition from FC2.

So... hopefully there will be some magical update down the road that adds a hard-core mode... or someone will figure out some way to mod the game.  I don't imagine Ubi releasing anything even close to Skyrim's Creation Kit.

But... that's my favorite thing about the Elder Scrolls games.

First off, Ubisoft is not EA, so it will more likely create DLC based on what the fans would want, and not simply selling part of the original game and charging extra. Dinosaurs wouldn't follow much of the storyline of the game, so they would better match the concept of adding a completely new idea, instead of a couple multiplayer maps.

There are references to dinosaurs in the game. I play on PS3 so I can't show screen shots but one of the sniper rifle's descriptions says that it is powerful enough to take down a T-Rex. Also, Privateers sometimes say, ""At least I'm not on the island with all the dinosaurs.""

There is only one character in the game: Jason. Jason's friends are subconscious figments and repressions. Jason's enemies are his desires being acted out. The cave is Jason's subconscious where he suppresses the things he doesn't want to deal with. The knife is Jason's penis. As Jason progresses toward manhood he constructs a fantasy. When his reality must be confronted, Jason takes the guise of a villain and tries to kill it. When this fails he puts it the cave. In the climax Jason must choose between glorious ego death and actualization or mundane adulthood.

* Daisy is the mother who is secretly desired, Grant is father who must be destroyed so that Jason can claim his place, steel his warrior essence, and screw his lover. Got Oedipus? 

* Liz/ Citra are the same character: the lover. Together hey are the true antagonist of the game. Liz is the lover who creates life while diminishing the penis. That's why the cock-stomping nag is in the cave. Citra destroys life by glorifying the penis. We desire to conquer her that she may destroy us. Didn't know sex is scary? Watch ""Eyes wide shut""

* Keith is latent homosexuality. He is only briefly encountered, as an afterthought, on the quest to discover the penis. Then he's off to the back of the cave. 

* Oliver is adolescence. He brings you to the cusp of adulthood (bankrolls the trip), but must be shed like the skin of the snake. (or the sticker on his hat) 

* Riley is the child self. The only character who occupies a deeper cave than the rest. You think he's dead, but you always have to deal with him in the end. 

* Vass is freedom in all it's glory and dread. He's you being dangerous to yourself (he stabs you with your own dick)

* Hoyt is the power and respect of adulthood. Looks great from a distance, but up close he's just Vass in a cage. To accept him is to deny the child. 

* The Doctor is the fear of old age. His only motivation is regret of his daughters death (the failure to create life). He is life without essence. (He ain't got no knife.) Drug addled and insane, he's the warning of what happens if you get it wrong. His fate is to tend the cave till he dies. 

* Dennis is religion. He shows up promising help when your at your most vulnerable, but he doesn't actually do shit. Ever the sexually frustrated hypocrite, Dennis resents your faith when it outshines his, but tries to destroy you if you dare reject it. 

* Buck is sexual perversion. He's competition for control of your penis. 

* Willis the true guide Dennis pretends to be. (Dennis never herd of him) You have to seek him out. He doesn't make any sense, you don't trust him, and he disappears before you appreciate what he's done.

* Sam is the savior, the unlikely redeemer. The pure goodness in Jason that only gains strength once it is sacrificed. (If this reminds you of Jesus then you need to take a hard look at your life. If this reminds you of Obi Wan then keep being awesome!)

Reviving can tip things for you at a crucial times in Team Deathmatch, going so far as actually stopping them from scoring, if you get the revive. People just away from your body like you're a swarm of bees.

2. People do not care about hanging on.

 If these same people didnt revive people because they worry too much about K/D ratio, and dont want to unnecessarily put themselves into harms way to revive another player, why would they instantly bleed out, sometimes even when a player has dispatched their killer, and is literally feet away from them. It'd save the Death, and I see no other alternative as to why you'd do it intentionally, unless you're out of ammo.

Begin with only your starter pistol with only one magazine, and nothing else (no syringes, grenades, anything) go into the options menu and turn every option OFF.

You can only use vehicles that have been taken from a pirate that was driving it, no using ANY vehicles that are just sitting around the place. NO FAST TRAVEL, and don't do any missions.

I find that I don't touch silenced weapons for actually sneaking, I just use the bow. It's usually a quicker, cleaner kill, and makes far less noise than a silenced gun. I usually only pull out the silenced guns when I'm surprised by a patrol and need to take them down quickly before attracting any more unwanted attention.

How did you find the endgame? In my opinion, I was mixed between awesome and dissapointing. It left too much holes for me, eg. what happened to Rakyat after Citra died? Or Dennis? Where did my friends go, did they manage to leave the Island in peace? 

Also, this game had the best villains (Vaas and Hoyt) I've seen in a long time, so It was a major dissapointment that how they had to be killed in that cinematic tripping world. After I killed Vaas, I honestly didn't even know if he was really dead. I thought Jason was just tripping balls and Vaas would introduce himself again later in game - but no. 

If you have any thoughts, positive or negative, please share!

EDIT: Also, not really endgame related, but in the opening cutscene where Vaas shows you the videos in your phone there appeared an urban disco/club where Jason and his friends were featuring. It really made me wait for some sort of urban city/village that would contain the club (appeared before) and or something else that would make a little more civilized feeling towards that part of the Island. Now when It's all just rural and ghetto. - Just a thought that has boggled my mind!

The first 8 hours or so, I really didn't like the protagonist at all. I posted about it, but the gist is that he's a whiny bitch.

Then suddenly, I felt Jason growing. Some stuff still didn't make sense — the never getting use to skinning animals after his several hundredth kill, for instance — but overall, I admitted I was wrong and took it back.

Well, I just finished the game and all I have to say is what terrible fucking endings.

Why I couldn't have saved my friends and stayed because I was too changed to go back to civilization and my work here wasn't done? I want to stay and help rebuild what has been destroyed. What about saving my friends by sacrificing myself? I can't for the life of me understand how either of the endings we are given were chosen.

I chose to save my friends because I'm not an asshole. This is clearly the better of the two endings, but it's still stupid. Why would Citra require me to slit my ex girlfriend's throat to stay on the island? I don't care which way you try to slice it, there isn't enough character built for us to accept this as part of who she is. The whole 'lover accidentally kills Citra when he tries to stab me because I turned down the love of the woman he loved' bit is just fucking retarded. After all that trouble, I should get a scene with my friends as well. Tell them I can't go back, I've still got work to do, I still need to find who I am, whatever... At least then I can justify roaming around the island after the end game. Where's my fucking closure?

The ending where you join Citra is fucking awful. The whole idea of whiny frat boy turned seeker-of-vengeance completely snapping and slitting his ex-girlfriend's throat is completely unbelievable, and a piss-poor requirement for getting to think I'm staying on the island. Moving past that, somehow Citra is willing to bet the farm on the fact that I'm going to knock her up in one shot so much so that she murders me. Again, her character simply has not been built up enough for me to accept that this is how bat-shit crazy she is. Yeah, I get she's fucking coocoo at the very end, but this is poor story-telling.

So in a nutshell, our options are to save my friends and get zero closure, or slit one of their throats — apparently sentencing the rest of them to their deaths — and get murdered with my dick in a crazy bitch? Seriously?

Bought this game two days ago and can't put it down. I haven't progressed much in the storyline because I love completing all tasks before I move on. 

With that said, what's the final verdict on the rock/camera bug? I've heard mix information, from it happens when you do certain sidequests, to it happens when you do ANY sidequests, etc. 

Has Ubisoft acknowledged this bug? I know once you ""get"" it there's no way to fix your game and with the amount of time I'm putting into the game's side missions I'd hate to start over.

First, I tried to take a mission in the main town because that was the only mission available. When I go inside the building, the door is closed and no one is there. Odd. I stepped out and suddenly there was a mission at Mike's Bar. It was getting some documents for chemicals. I did the mission, but the ""buddy"" is no longer at the bar and I found him chilling at one of the safe houses. I can't give him the docs at the safe house, nor can I take the other mission from the town because when i go back the door inside is still closed. 

I tried sleeping at the safe house for days at a time. Nothing. I've tried restarting the game in hopes my buddy would spawn back at Mike's Bar, but nothing....I don't want to restart everything!

Here are the ideas I've come up with:

* Hardest difficulty

* Bow only (exploding arrows are OK, but only while undetected, particularly for dealing with heavies/elites; I think the instant alert that it causes is a fair trade off for its being potentially OP).  Bow attachments are OK.  A silenced pistol would be another good option for a one-weapon game, I think.

* Other weapons are OK only for quests/missions that require them.  Mounted vehicle guns are OK, since I'll be hard pressed to put them to use with only 2 health slots.

* Takedowns allowed

* Unlock no radio towers other than the first one (which is required), not a huge deal weapons-wise since this requires only using the bow anyway. (I don't think this would lock out anything else other than supply drop quests?)  Or, only unlock the towers and do the supply drop quests after doing EVERYTHING else.

* No buying maps, only open the chests and collect relics/lost letters you come across in the course of playing

* No health upgrades, maybe some other restrictions on the skill grid (haven't looked closely enough at it yet)

* Takedown, bow, and sneaking/movement upgrades are allowed

* Inventory upgrades allowed

* No Fast Traveling (note that I'd be doing story mode/item upgrades first and then outposts/quests last, so I think this works, thanks Kayato13)

* Wingsuit OK

* No camera

* Skill enhancement syringes...I haven't used them much as it is except for the hunting quests, although it would be a lot more difficult bow-hunting panthers or leopards or whatever without Hunter's Instinct, so I'm going to go with medical syringes only...and I guess combat syringes etc that don't let you see where enemies are, I think the lesser syringes would be a lot more fun if I actually had to use them.

* Liberate every outpost undetected (but only doing this last, after completing the story, to increase enemy density on the map: it's too much fun to leave out IMO, and having only the few fast travel locations that are unlocked by default might be interesting.  This would also restrict the top-tier inventory containers until this point.)

The game freezes for about 3 seconds than it just takes me to the desktop and shows the game as if it was minimized but the sound is still playing. I am not able to re-maximize the game.

I can not really pinpoint a reason, as it crashes randomly during fights or while just standing still or while hunting an animal.

Tried the following without any results:

* Compability-Mode
* Run as administrator
* Closing every application in the background
* Disabling second monitor
* ...

I've searched google but couldn't find any solution yet. Only a guy said he read ""somewhere"" that you'd need to change the name of some .exe file, but no more info.

Also I read that you should not play it from an external drive.

I've been seeing quite a few posts that talk about pirated copies of the game. **No more posts that involve piracy in any way.** There is absolutely no reason to pirate games,  there's more than enough info, reviews and gameplay on the internet to figure out if you like a game or not.

I am not expecting this game to run at max settings, but I still cannot get it to work properly. Yesterday, when I got the game, I tweaked the game until it worked fine for my standards (30-40fps at 1920x1200). That included changing to DirectX 9 instead of 11 (which helped a lot), settings all the graphical options to high, with the exception of ""Ambient Lighting"", which was at medium. I even installed the latest Beta Driver from AMD.


Now this worked all fine and dandy, until I tried to continue my game today. Now, the same settings are more or less useless, unless I am in a very confined space/looking at the ground. And that's also another thing; what I was looking at suddenly had a much larger impact on my framerate. As in, I can no longer look out on large open areas (like out to the ocean, or the view from a mountain top) without getting shit FPS. Even with everything on ""Low"" I still get below 30 fps.

This has basically ruined the game for me as exiting the game and re loading does not fix it and anything I do in game has this stupid bottle popping up.

&gt;**Spent $50 on this game from Steam, spent an entire day downloading it. Had to redownload it thus wasting another one of my days. Finally got round to playing it when the game does not launch. Oh, and my account is banned.**

&gt;uPlay keeps asking me to enter my serial number which I have done on many occasions. Sometimes it accepts it, most of the time it does not. Now my account is banned for god knows what reason! Before this I couldn't even play the game! All I got was the splash screen and then a Window popped up. You can clearly see the Windows 7 border and Close/Minimize etc buttons (Which really does not make any sense seeing as I'm on Windows 8). The entire Window is just black. I am forced to Alt+F4 my way out due to that lack of ability to move my mouse and close down the FarCry 3 process from Task Manager because uPlay tells me ""Closing down a game while it is active could be dangerous"". Also, if I don't close down the process then the next time I launch FarCry 3 it'll ask me for a serial number again to which it'll tell me is incorrect (This happens every single time). This was my first time purchasing a Ubisoft product and if this doesn't get fixed it will be my last. An entire weekend waisted on this &gt;:(

I don't see the point in launching it through Steam other than to track my hours.  I kind of imagine Uplay is doing that for me anyway.

I also haven't - according to Steam - exited the game until I close Uplay as well.

The deluxe extras activation - what a clusterfuck that is.  The only reason I knew how to enter the code correctly is from reading the forums a few days ago.  (Enter that code Steam gives you - from the in-game menu - *without* any dashes if you didn't already know.)

That should have been a non-issue.  One activation for Steam, a Uplay account activation, and finally the in-game activation.  All for something usually handled with one code/purchase through Steam.  Bravo, Ubisoft.  Take a page from Gearbox and their Borderlands 2 shift codes if you feel the need to activate additional content.  Don't leave your customers guessing.  That should have been a non-issue from the start.

I see a lot of people having issues with the graphics.  Personally, I have none, but I think I'm just lucky.  My GPU is build into my MB (lol), but the game runs and looks pretty nice on medium settings.  I'm not picky about that though.

The hitboxes (or whatever you want to call them) for looting/skinning are pretty jacked.  I regularly have to strafe around a corpse until the option to loot/skin appears.  Same problem - occasionally - for entering cars or opening doors.

Pathways - walking up the ramps on a radio tower or even walking through a doorway (weapon store, first town) doesn't flow very smoothly.  I often stall like my sweater is caught on a nail.

I suppose a lot of this is just bitching for the sake of bitching, but it's also the kind of things that makes a guy want to wait for a couple patches before returning to the island.

- Purchasing and launching Far Cry 3 from steam still uses some sort of Uplay client inbetween. How intrusive is it and is a separate Uplay login account still required? 

- Judging from other recent ubisoft games on steam (AC:R, AC:Bhood and such) steam does not have achievements for these titles so I assume they are stored in uplay. So all in all, all steam does here is keep track of time played and acts as a pre-launcher launcher?

I'm asking this because I try to avoid using other launchers/digital delivery platforms as I want to keep everything under the same roof so to speak and Steam has done this for me rather well so far.

EA(Origin) and Ubisoft games do not usually interest me but FC3 is a different situation so I'm still contemplating if I should get it on steam or save nearly 20€ by buying it on DVD.

I've heard that Ubisoft will rate very good maps and they will appear as official content in the future. Is there any information how the rating system works?

2. Multiplayer: Is there a way I can filter multiplayer games for ping? there are three bars and I get 70% of the time only 1 bar, and the rest of the time only 2 bars. I've never had 3 bars and it's very frustating to see the enemies warp around.

3. Expansions: FarCry 3 is my first title of the Far Cry series and how likley is it for the game to get content patches/expansions. Maybe multiplayer expansion? 

4. Movement: is there a way to toggle the sprint? Right now you just have to press the shift key once and you will sprint as long as you move, but I would like to only sprint as long as I press the shift key. Also: is there a way in multiplayer to reload while sprinting? It feels very unusual to exit the reload animation because you are used to sprint while reloading.

First of all, I had a great time. the game is versatile, expanded and thought-provoking. 
But..

* The first thing I thought after killing Vaas is that I saw more of that wonderful antagonist in the marketing campaign than in the game itself. 

* I waited anxiously for the ""Did I ever tell you the definition"" scene, seen in [E3 2011](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaGSSrp49uc), but they changed it completely, and for the worse. it feels almost like they tried to hide Vaas's character from the game. 

* The use of ""miraculous mushrooms"" is very small, and only used in one cutscene.

* Jason's voice doesn't change. wtf is that about? after killing so many men and going though hell several times, your voice ought to change. trust me, I've been in the army - your voice and attitude changes. I guess some experiences just slap the 14 year old beach boy out of you.

* The ending feels a bit rushed. the whole story is taken small step at a time, and at some point, the pace of the story feels like the developers really wanted to rush through.

* you are travelling alone most of the time. there is an entire tribe of warriors by your side, and you're fighting alone? I was expecting an option to bring tribe mates with you to missions/side missions.

what do you guys think?

*Edit: added the E3 link.

It's quite annoying. So far I've found that reloading or going through a cutscene while its glitched will fix it. Also, going through a cutscene while its NOT glitched will cause it. The blurry outline is also present when I'm in the village where you're not allowed to have a weapon out. In this case, the outline is of the weapon that I would bring out should I leave the village.

Just found something else. If I rotate/shoot while standing still, the gun's movements don't reveal any kind of blur but as soon as I start walking or strafing, any movement reveals that blurry gun. I should also note that the blurry gun never moves. It is simply revealed when the actual gun doesn't cover it.

Maybe my Googlefu isn't very good but I did my best to search my issue before posting. Hope I can get this resolved.",,False,self,t5_2st42,False,,,True,t3_17gyf4,http://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/17gyf4/weird_graphic_glitch_any_ideas_on_how_to_fix_it/,
