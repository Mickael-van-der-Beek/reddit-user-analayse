I'd like to compile a list of them. Here's a few of my favorites for starters.

""Power is a lot like real estate. It's all about location, location, location. The close you are to the source, the higher your property value."" - Frank Underwood

""How quickly poor grades vanish in the shadow of power and wealth"" - Frank Underwood

""And then he asked if I had no faith in God. I said, 'No you have it wrong. It's God who has no faith in us'"" - Frank Underwood

""It's degrading I know, but when the tit's that big, everyone gets in line."" - Frank Underwood (Episode 2) 

""I'm not going to lie. I despise children. There, I've said it."" - Frank Underwood  (Episode 9)

""They say dad's going to O.D. like Amy Winehouse."" - Kevin Russo (Episode 9) 

""I almost pity him. He didn't ask to be put on my platter. When I carve him up and toss him to the dogs, only then will he confront that brutal, inescapable truth: 'My God, all I ever amounted to was chitlins.'"" - Frank Underwood

""You see, Freddy believes that if a fridge falls off a minivan, you better swerve out of its way. I believe it's the fridge's job to swerve out of mine."" - Frank Underwood (Episode 4)

“Such a waste of time. He chose money over power, in this town, a mistake nearly everyone makes. Money is the McMansion in Sarasota that starts falling apart after ten years. Power — is the old stone building that stands for centuries. I cannot respect someone who doesn’t see the difference.” - Frank Underwood

“There are two kinds of pain, the sort of pain that makes you strong, or the useless pain, the sort of pain that’s only suffering.” - Frank Underwood

""After all, we are nothing more or less than we choose to reveal."" - Frank Underwood

""Every Tuesday I sit down with the Speaker and the Majority Leader to discuss the week's agenda. Well, ""discuss"" is probably the wrong word...they talk, while I imagine their lightly-salted faces, frying in a skillet.""  - Frank Underwood

""You may despise me Oren, but the classy thing to do would have been to invite us up for some of that iced tea."" - Frank Underwood

""You show up at my house in the middle of the night, drunk. To whine. To try to shift the blame on me instead of taking responsibility for yourself and your own actions? Maybe they were right about you. Maybe you are worthless. I'm the only person who believes in you Peter, but maybe that's one too many."" Frank Underwood to Peter Russo

""Most people see fear as a weakness. It can be. Sometimes for my job, I have to put fear into people. I know it's not right, but if I'm honest, like the 4 Steps asks us to be, I have to be ruthless. Because failure is not an option. The same goes for my sobriety. I have to be ruthless with myself. I have to use my fear. It makes me stronger.""  - Doug Stamper

""If I didn't think you were such a liability to yourself congressman, I might even like you."" - New York Times reporter to Peter Russo
""If your circulation were as high as the Wall St. Journal, I might like you back."" - Peter Russo in response.

Speculation is a poor form of investment and an equally poor form of politics."" - Raymond Tusk to Frank Underwood

""I pray to myself, for myself."" - Frank Underwood

""I won't be a slave to anyone or anything you can order with a toll free number."" 
- Frank Underwood

""What am I, a whore in post-war Berlin salivating over free stockings and chocolate?"" - Frank Underwood

""You want me to say those three magic words, one of which starts with an 'L'. Ok. I'll say it. Christina, lick my balls."" - Peter Russo

Underwood: I'm sorry Mr. President but I will not do that.

President: Are you letting pride cloud you judgement, Frank?

Underwood: Respectfully sir, you are letting fear cloud yours.

""If I was gonna fuck you, you'd know it."" - Zoe Barnes

""I love that woman, I love her more than sharks love blood."" - Frank Underwood

We have the classic protoge/mentor relationship.  The series starts with Frank trying to avoid Remy due to his loss of the Secretary of State.  Their first encounter Remy goes as far as threatening Frank with the lines ""Don't make them throw money at your challenger"".  Remy attempts to seduce Frank's wife at one point, works with Frank's wife to undermine what Frank is trying to do with Russo, seems to be following Frank at many times during the series.. keeping an eye on him, and even directly crosses Frank when Frank asks for San Corp's help, along with directly telling Tusk of Frank's plan.  Frank quotes ""Such a waste of talent, he chose money over power"".. but we know Remy is clearly positioning himself for the money and power especially after his dealings with Tusk.  Frank appears to always underestimate Remy's power.  We all know Remy is as intelligent and as manipulative as Frank, he did learn from the best.  So why hasn't Frank even attempted to retaliate against Remy at any point ?  Is he really afraid of what Remy and San-corp can do ?  When Claire is first approached about San-corp's donation to her charity, Frank almost does sound fearful in that he doesn't want to be owing them any debts and to tells Clarie to stay away, they'll do it on their own.  Is it out of his past relationship with Remy ?  Is it because Frank is to focused on his other goals ?  

tldr:  Why doesn't Frank do anything against Remy ?

It may sound silly, but he really was the protagonist in season one.

Francis is the focus of the show, and i absolutely love his character, but I really can't align with him... he is all about stature and power. Zoe I could give to shits about, although I can identify with her struggling to get her career off the ground. The other characters really dont do anything for me...really, Russo drove season one for me.

I hated Russo in the first couple of episodes, but he really grew on me. He was the audience's ""Everyman"". We could identify with his struggles and he started as a congressman with no ambition to a guy gunning for Governor...

...Then, Russo gets involved in Francis' world and its game over. The sad part is that Russo was just another pawn, but his character was weak, and the he should have seen the set-up from a mile away. Also sort of reminded me of the dog that frank killed in the first episode, because honestly, Russo probably would have killed himself anyway.

It will be interesting who plays the ""Everyman"" in season 2 now that Russo is gone. Perhaps Francis will get knocked down a peg or two, and he will be our ""Everyman""? I don't know...

Let's face it. Frank is a sociopath. A manipulative, lying asshole [and a murded](/spoiler) who doesn't care about anybody expect himself. He does everything to get what he wants.

But I sill can't hate Frank. The creators did a very good job in the unique way they let him talk to the audience. This makes you kind of his buddy. We aren't just an audience who observes what he is doing, we are part of his plans and it makes me even root for him.

In fact we don't even know what exactly Frank thinks or feels about her. There have been very few times when Frank has spoken about Claire.

I think Season 2 will focus on her a lot more and give us a better perspective on the significance of a lot of the other events (like the graveyard scene, homeless man scene, her relationship with Adam etc.)

I've seen the British version so I know what Urquhart does and Underwood's actions are very similar and I'm super excited to see how Netflix will translate To Play the King and The Final Cut into Washington DC.

Spoilers for UK HOC and US HOC S1 and possible S2 spoilers below.

Something that irked me a bit about the way Underwood dealt with Russo was how hands off it was - it was a lot more passive and opportunistic rather than planned as was Urquhart's murder of O'Neill, whose cocaine he laced with rat poison.

I'm hoping that Francis deals with Zoe in a much more hands-on way to make up for that. In UK HOC, Urquhart kills his problem journalist (Mattie Storin) by throwing her off of the roof of the House of Commons roof garden, an area which he goes to to calm down and think and be alone - it's his place of peace.

Underwood relieves the stress of his machiavellian ways by gaming and also by using his rowing machine... One of the first times he meets with Zoe, Underwood says something along the lines of how he could only save himself from drowning. He's speaking metaphorically there of course, but I think it's possible that Underwood might drown Zoe, which IMO more than makes up for the passive killing of Russo as I'm fairly sure that Zoe will put up a fight and Underwood will have to actively be killing her.

That's how I think Underwood will kill Zoe.

I'm not entirely sure how closely US HOC will follow UK HOC, but UK HOC S2 (To Play the King) puts Urquhart, who is now serving as Prime Minister, against the King who causes a constitutional crisis when he all but declares his support for the Labour Party (as opposed to Urquhart's Conservative Party) and essentially campaigns for them which he is not supposed to do.

I'm from the UK, so I don't get all the US's political news, so I'd like to ask how often the Vice-President and President are likely to disagree with each other on something? I think that in S2 we're going to see a lot of conflict between Underwood and Walker, with Walker ultimately resigning the office and causing Underwood to come to power without having to be elected. This is how Urquhart comes to power in UK HOC and as we're currently a way off an election in the US HOC timeline I can't see any other way Underwood would come to be the President, which I am certain he will.",,False,self,t5_2t3ft,False,,,True,t3_1iu72e,http://www.reddit.com/r/HouseOfCards/comments/1iu72e/season_2_predictions_spoilers/,

When Frank asks for the two extra tickets, he makes sure the seats next to him are empty so his face is seen more on camera. Because as he points out years down the road when it is time to elect a new president people pay attention to the faces who are at the front.

I think this really points out Franks complete and total manipulation of everything around him. I also noticed many other subtle manipulations, but that one really stuck out at me.

Also I might be grasping at straws here, but he could have been purposely checking out Zoey. After all he admitted he already knew about two of her articles.

Stamper put it best, though, before they ended up tempting him early - there's no telling how Peter would react to it.  If they'd have waited, would it have been easier to predict how Russo would respond to the hooker?  Do you think there's anything Frank would've brought in to make it more tempting?

Again about Russo, I think Frank too easily assumed that he had total control over him.  It seems out of character that he wouldn't have predicted that Peter would use the Kaperniak thing against him, eventually.  I was disappointed in Frank's only contingency plan for this being murder, but it was still a powerful scene.

Also, did anyone else think that the coolest scene in the whole show so far was the church scene?  Specifically the line about ""our mutual distain"", while looking directly into the camera.

He establishes a plan early in the series to ""devour the whale one piece at a time."" By the end of the season, Frank is in place to take over the station of VP, through a ruthless plot involving Russo and Matthews.

It seems that Frank's plan all along is to leverage the importance of the PA special election to maneuver his way to where he is at the end of episode 13. This means he needed Matthews to step down from VP to govern PA. To achieve this, he needed to create a crisis within that campaign. To achieve that, he managed Russo's campaign to hold off any other prospective candidates and then tanked it on purpose leaving the DNC with too little time to groom someone new.

He flies off the handle at Claire for her betrayal on the Water Shed bill, stating that they had a specific time table they needed to fulfill, i.e. keeping Russo viable up until the last minute. The DRWA was a big part of keeping Russo viable. However, after the DRWA is defeated, Frank quickly sets up Russo at the gala with Rachel the prostitute. He doesn't seem to maneuver at all to prolong Russo's campaign viability and simply decides to proceed with the sabotage phase. Why was he so angry at Claire for pushing up the timetable if he so quickly destroyed Russo anyway? Am I interpreting the plot incorrectly?

This is a remarkably intricate and well-run show; I can't wait to see where they go with S2.

But there's one thing that's bothering me.

Throughout the season, we have seen Frank slowly build up his plan, manipulating anyone who could help, destroying anyone who got in his way, and generally being a brilliant son of a bitch. In the last few episodes, we saw his plan finally come to a head and it was revealed that his ultimate end goal was a VP nomination. And Zoe seems to have finally realized that as well. But a couple of steps along the way seem to contradict that conclusion.

Let's work backwards through this. Frank has been offered the VP slot because Matthews is stepping down to run for his old Gubernatorial seat. Matthews had to step down because of Russo's flameout and death. Russo imploded because Frank drove him back into the bottle, because Russo was becoming a loose cannon and threatening to destroy Frank. Russo was doing that because he was pissed off that Frank had failed to secure the Watershed Act, which would have helped him win the Governor's race. And, of course, that happened because Claire turned against Frank, and we all remember how Frank reacted to that.

And that's the problem. If Frank was aiming for the VP nomination, then why was he pissed off when Claire scuttled the Watershed Act? If she hadn't done that, it would have passed and Russo would have had a good shot at the Gubernatorial election. If Russo won the election, Matthews would stay where he was, and there would be no need to nominate a new VP.

I suppose it's possible that Frank had a different plan to destroy Russo before the election, forcing the outcome that we saw. But if that was the case, there was no reason for him to push so hard for the Watershed Act, and there was certainly no reason for him to be angry at Claire for undermining it. If anything, she gave him the perfect opportunity to accomplish his goal.

He has the qualities for success and the predisposition for accomplishments we all strive for, but his evil is beyond unforgiving. Yet, I feel compelled to root for him; to wish for a get away.
The blood on his hand drips across the capitol floor, and through the lives of many, and yet he still manages to disguise this trail. And upon up-close inspection his hands are fucking pristine.
The scene at the church just reveals to me how lost of a man he really is. Not because he doesn't believe in God or Devil, for believing or disbelieving in either of those two things never make or break a man. But his prayer, there was anguish in his voice, desperation, a battled demeanor, even when he prayed to Satan. The whole scene blew me away. I felt compelled to help him, guide him through this labyrinthic mess he himself created. It reminded me of Walter White, a man so attached to his conviction, that everything he does to get ahead makes him despise himself even more. 
I don't know what to expect of Underwood, I know he will find a way to get out, to survive, and I want goodness for him. I don't want punishment. Yet I know this man will never find solace or redemption. And there is no jail time, or religion, or anything at all left for this man to find refuge. 
His wife is as conniving and cold-hearted as he is, and their whimsical, egotistical legacy it's quickly consume, like shooting up a heroin, getting a high, and wanting more. Insatiable addicts. 
The things they do together are for immediate remuneration. No friends, no love, just dedication, goals, thirst for power. And the legacy that comes from it is just a trail of destruction that sucks them deeper into a black hole. I feel sorry for them...I feel like I could kill them myself, but yet, I have nothing but compassion...why?? Why? I know its fictional and entertaining...and you want to the protagonist (or antagonist) to get away and everyone to live happily ever after...yet the show's so real I can think but for their demise as the only way out...
As this whole story unravels, Jillian keeps me grounded. 
""I want to fight for a better world for my baby, to prevent from people like you (Claire) to destroy this planet.""

I see myself driving a fast car in the middle of night, out to find them, but when I see them, Claire and Francis, like deer in headlights, I want to slam on the brakes a second prior to impact...

There is no good v. evil narrative here.  This story happens inside the machine that produces the hero/villain news narrative.  There's no heroic team to join here.  There is only a collection of power-seekers navigating their own relationships with (barely) themselves and (mainly) the power game with others they play.

Having just finished episode 13, I see clearly the absence of a YAY Left/Right BOO Right/Left narrative.  In its place is a 13-hour exposition of the structure of power.

In my opinion, this work of fiction has more truth than 30 so-called documentaries I've watched.  In both distribution and content, there's something new and promising here.

One of my favorite admissions of Claire's character is when she tells her Doctor that she's had 3 abortions. It's said so casually and left as such a mystery that it really stuck with me. We have no clue if those abortions involved Frank or not. Knowing how much Frank didn't want kids it kind of surprises me he would never get his tubes tied.

To continue with things I loved about Claire is when she shacks up with the photographer. At first I thought it was stupid, mainly because I think he's an opportunistic jerk eager to exploit other people's misery for ""art"", but I came around when they were both looking at the photo of the woman in the park. It really drove home the idea that in some other world Claire had chosen the artist over the politician. 

I also loved the juxtaposition of Gillian's pregnancy and her drives with Frank and Claire's. (Total Sidebar: I can't be the only one that thought Claire was trying to seduce Gillian, right? I maybe a horndog but I sincerely thought this show was going to go down a very Clinton-esque path.) It really brings out how much Frank blindly wants power for himself, which if he had I'm not sure he would even know what to do with. I'm reminded of Rob Delaney talking about what if Mitt Romney had won and how Mitt would sit in the Oval Office and say ""Well, I'm President now. This is just swell"" as he stared off into space doing nothing.

I'm sure having children and a pregnancy will play into next season. I can see Frank using it to his political advantage, whether it's to blow one story out of the water or to make him seem more like a real human. Then again we could be in for a particularly nasty miscarriage angle.

So I'm in my second watching of the season and I noticed something strange. At the beginning of the first episode, when Frank loses his shot at the Secretary of State job, he makes his plan, which works out over the next twelve episodes. The only issue for me is, in order for Frank to be considered for VP, the current VP would have to be out of the picture, and the only way that could be done is by sending him back to Pennsylvania to resume his role as governor. For that to happen, Frank needed a candidate from Pennsylvania to fall out of the race. The only reason Peter becomes Frank's pawn is because of his DUI in episode one, and his solicitation of a prostitute. If Peter hadn't been pulled over that night, Doug never could have gotten him out of jail, and they wouldn't have a governor candidate. Before the get their hands on Peter, they were looking for their ""buffer."" If this had not happened, Frank's plan could not have worked.

Also Christina should have been a little more suspicious at Doug than the show showed.

What just happened?  Everything fell apart!  I'm confused, and I apologize in advance for this convoluted post. 

Peter Russo... what happened?  I hate Francis for using him like that, Russo was a good guy.  Ugh... What happened?  I was sure we were going to find him dead in the bathtub with his wrists slit.  But it seems like he ran away somehow.  Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

Zoe... Zoe and Francis' relationship was getting to be really weird, and Lucas seems nice... I don't know what to expect here.  I really hope Francis stops using Zoe for sex, but I think we all know that's not going to happen.

Claire... Her turning on Francis seemed a bit out of character, but who knows.  All I know is that I hate her for it, everyone would have been happy and perfect if it wasn't for that.  Also, Adam Galloway creeps me out.

Linda Vasquez... What does Francis want from her?  Any thoughts?  He went through a lot of trouble to get in her good graces.

Remi... What is Francis doing with Remi and Russo?  I'm not sure what the point is.  He must be doing something crazy.

I apologize for the weirdness of this post, but this episode got me feeling all emotional and confused, I have to take a break and think it over.  

""Look at the bigger picture."" keeps coming back to me... something big must be happening.

Sadly I can't say the same for Claire and am wondering if I missed something in her story. I don't have a problem with her acting, but instead the arc of her story and its relevance. When the series started out I assumed that the CWI would be a front for a nefarious operation that F and C had set up together, which was why Claire was pushing for an international presence at the CWI when Frank was going to be Sec State. 

I never got the sense that she truly cared about the mission of the CWI and that she treated it sort of like a pet hobby. I actually remain uncertain of its purpose. Then halfway through the series she sabotages both her husband and Russo (whom she had given no indication of ill will) over a minor issue of some water filters, knowing it would come back to her. Then she is in the wind hooking up with some creepy dude in NYC and finally returns to D.C. and starts having baby lust.

(Seriously, just firing a gun at a fleeing victim in a residential neighbourhood... forget the entirely valid stray bullet issue; what if there was another armed guy or twelve at the back door... shittiest bodyguard ever).

Before that: Claire is placed in some situation where she can either save Gillian and her baby or not (maybe a private showdown where Gillian falls and is at a risk of miscarrying) and chooses not to help wherein Gillian and the baby die as a result -- thereby making her as bad or worse than Franks actions with Russo.

Also: Stamper becomes attached to, and identifies with, Rachel to such an extent that she is in someway hurt by Frank, he is the one to tell Meetchum that the brick was a hoax.  He either dies or runs off with Rachel... maybe Frank demands his time and he wasn't there to help Rachel in some crisis and as a result Rachel gets hurt or dies and -- as he comes to understand that they are both essentially damaged individuals selling their services in different forms -- his chance at salvation is lost, he falls off the wagon, and betrays Frank (i.e. becomes a good guy at last as Frank is a straight up fucking murderer no matter how complex, interesting, and endearing).

If the second (final) season was shot prior to the Red Wedding, possible murders and deaths will be injuries.  If it was shot after... it will be as close to a bleak Shakespearean tragedy as a drama set in modern times will allow.

As for Lucas and Zoe, she's going to fuck the relationship up by sleeping with Frank ""one last time"" for who knows what reason... I think ambition, but it'll probably be out of spite or somesuch.

The only one coming out ahead in the whole thing will be Janine, whose work ethic, experience, and single-mindedness will keep her safe... unless it doesn't.

Oh yeah, Claire gets pregnant, the baby is Adam's but Frank doesn't know, she miscarries and Frank isn't there thereby killing her abiding devotion to him once and for all.

Alexis

The show itself is a metaphor for both of these. Netflix delivering instant video is similar to newspapers delivering online information. Netflix is trying to prove that online information will become more important than cable television, like Zoe is trying to prove online information is more important than print. Everyone knows that hard print/cable television without an online option is dying, netflix and zoe represent the inner drive to fully take the step past the cable giants/written newspaper.


Frank is Netflix. While Frank has some power as whip, he'd like to have more. Netflix has established itself to be viable and has some power, but it would like to have more. Frank's plan to slowly ascend to power is like Netflix's plan to slowly produce viable show options. As House of Cards gains more praise and Netflix gains more power and influence so does Frank slowly ascend through the ranks until he/Netflix have power to influence.

Would it be that useful to have the governor of Pennsylvania be loyal to him?

I think stopping where they did left it like the first season of Lost - a feeling of ""this is going to be good, let's see where it goes.""

[Marc Bodnick on Quora reinforced this notion in my head](http://www.quora.com/House-of-Cards/I-really-like-the-story-based-on-intrigue-and-political-scheming-in-House-of-Cards-What-books-should-I-read-to-find-similar-themes/answer/Marc-Bodnick?srid=3Aco&amp;st=ns).  It was a role reversal from the classic novel [where Adam Stanton kills Willie Stark](/spoiler), but certainly Beau Willimon made creative changes to make the story new and his own.  If not for [the preemptive strike](/spoiler), it would have played out similarly to the novel.

If you haven't read the novel, I highly recommend it.

You find it strange he is sitting in the passengers seat in his own car, that he is assumed to have drove home himself. But ok. Then you find no prints on the steering wheel, completely wiped clean. Is none of this a tip off that maybe this wasn't just a suicide? Or the officers that escort Russo out of the station into Doug's arms, they just act like he was never there? Do they mention to investigators he left with Frank's right hand man? Seems to me that there would be more scrutiny over these red flags.

That takes what it wants. Does net flix want us to stop obama. Is it owned by republicans.is the next war a consumer war. Between the opressed and subjugated. Even the strongest women are made to look. Weak. Like no matter what they do they got to fuck their fathers to get a job. Is peter russos girlfriend kristina going to show that women still have it pretty rough and the democrats are guilty of it. So the next step is destroying the government that the next step to freedom from a consumer world is to end our leaders.
