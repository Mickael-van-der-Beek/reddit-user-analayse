Hey Guys,

After seeing a lot of questions about Glock 19 v Glock 23, I decided to put a table together. 

This table lists part numbers for the 19 and 23, both Gen3 and Gen4. You can quickly see which parts are shared across models and generations. 

Of note:
Gen3 19s and 23s shared the same recoil springs. Not the case for Gen4. 

There is a different trigger mechanism housing for each of the 4 models. This is due to the different ejectors. 

Firing pins between 9 and 40 are different. This is rarely mentioned. 


I'm happy to do another comparison for other models. Just ask. Whichever is most requested is the one I'll do. ",,False,self,t5_2v6xn,False,,,True,t3_1i42ba,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/1i42ba/a_guide_to_glock_19_vs_glock_23/,

1371091098.0,51,self.Glocks,1g8q8t,Some Glock Basics,,62,11,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/1g8q8t/some_glock_basics/,"I need to babble a little bit (in a constructive way), about a lot of things that seem to come up here a lot. Consider this an almost-FAQ. Also note that I am speaking about the Glock *in terms of a combat firearm, for self defense, or duty use*. I am not talking about things that people do to their guns for competition use. Competition guns are always finicky and different beasts.

Sorry if this is a little rant-y; I am really not trying to offend anyone - just disseminate some information.

*Basics*

Gaston Glock is a senior plastics engineer, and his design objective with the Glock was to create a very reliable, very simple weapon. That implies a few things:

1) Many things do double duty - For example, the hole at the bottom of the grip helps to keep the connector clear, and acts as extra gripping surface to clear the magazine in case the action jams up and you can't actuate the slide.

2) The gun is not, and probably never will be pretty, except accidentally - The lockup clearances of the barrel, for example, are designed to make it as likely as possible that the gun will go into battery. They are not supertight for target shooting, and the geometry of the recoil is not designed to be gentle on the finish of the barrel. They will get scratched up, and that is fine.

Another great example is the Glock 'pig nose'. For those unfamiliar, this is a slight deformation of the front of the receiver, underneath the muzzle. This is completely irrelevant, and can be ignored. The area is little more than a dust cover, and should actually be flexible during firing. This caused some early problems with rail mounted lights preventing .40S&amp;W from cycling properly. This is resolved, and not an issue. Achieving operating temperatures that can permanently damage the gun are exceedingly unlikely, unless you're really, really trying.

3) The trigger is intentional - The Glock was designed for the Austrian Army. Many military rifles have staged triggers, and especially so the Steyr AUG - the Austrian Army's primary assault rifle. It directly addressed a desire for familiarity in training. You'll have varying degrees of luck trying to make it ""different"", and there are some factory parts to achieve that. Going far outside of those parameters probably means that you are defeating some other intentional design characteristic that relies upon on it. It's not recommendable if your objective is to maintain your Glock as a reliable combat weapon.

4) The plastic guide rod is fine - The guide rod being plastic is completely irrelevant. If you can put it together without the guide rod, with just the spring, your gun will still function fine. Guide rod failure normally does not equate to weapon failure. If you're really worried about it, inspect it on a regular basis, *like you should everything else on your gun*.

*Recommendations for maintaining a Glock as a reliable combat handgun*

1) Don't add stuff your Glock doesn't need. This includes:

- Grip plugs
- Custom whatever

2) Don't replace factory Glock parts with 3rd party parts that have infinitely less verified service ability. This includes:

- 3rd party trigger assemblies
- 3rd party connectors
- 3rd party guide rods.
- Esoteric caliber change configurations
- Third party barrels that advertise ""tighter lockup"" and ""greater accuracy"".

3) Keep your gun lightly lubricated. The design tolerances are loose on purpose, and your gun will need very little slip to prevent friction building up heat. Keep your striker channel DRY; it has a plastic liner inside which will ensure that its moving geometry is correct, and trouble-free. Keep your connector engagements very lightly lubricated. Very lightly. Keep your slide rails also lightly lubricated.

4) DO keep your gun clean, even if it is extremely resistant to adverse conditions.

5) DO NOT feed it a regular diet of things like 9mm +P+. The majority of +P+ ammunition is actually detrimental to ballistics because the bullet was usually not designed to accommodate those velocities. It would also be unfortunate to suffer a recoil spring failure when you're staring death in the face. Instead of worrying about the last couple of ft-lbs of energy you can possibly squeeze out of your gun, learn the differences in POA and POI of your weapon with your preferred ammunition until it becomes instinctive. Shooting your gun, a lot, will do far more for your survival than anything else.

6) DO disassemble and clean your magazines periodically. I run mine 99% dry, with a very light, finger-applied coating of oil over the spring wire just for rust protection.

7) Do carry a spare magazine. The two most common points of failure on any semi-automatic handgun are the magazine and the ammunition.

8) Check your recoil spring on a regular basis. If the slide can lock back into battery unassisted when you point the gun upwards and depress the slide a quarter of an inch or so, your spring is fine. Subcompacts have a little bit more play and may require a very light touch for the slide to rock back into battery; this is normally also fine, unless you experience other symptoms.

9) If you're FTFing or FTEing, and your recoil spring is fine, you are most likely either: 1) limp wristing (consult google), or 2) shooting bad ammo.

10) The gold grease looking stuff in your new Glock is factory copper grease. Glock recommends that you keep it on for the first few hundred rounds. It's presence ensures that any accidental machining burrs are smoothed out, since it is abrasive. You are welcome to leave it on, or clean it off as you please.

PLEASE READ.",spaz1904,60,16,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/14eiht/glocks_are_not_perfect_in_fact_some_are_seriously/,"Okay, before you set flame to your torches and sharpen your pitchfork, please hear me out.

I own a Glock 19 Gen4 and three 10 round magazines. Everything is factory stock, no upgrades. So far I've shot 400 rounds of Walmart Federal Champion through this gun flawlessly. 

However, a recent problem came to light when I tried to shoot a full mag of Federal Hydrashock Hollowpoints. On the LAST round of the magazine, I experiences a failure to feed. Not thinking anything of it, I cycled the last round out, put it back in the magazine, and hit the slide release. Bam. Another FTF. This really bothered me because I had already had my serving of Glock Perfection Koolaid. So I tried putting one round of Federal Champion in the magazine, and hitting the slide release. The round chambered just fine. I tried it this again with one round of my buddy's reloads (plated round nose, same length as Federal Champion), and ANOTHER failure to feed when hitting the slide release. All of these FTFs were of the same nature; the round never made it to the feed ramp. Instead the bullet goes straight into the bottom of the feed ramp lip, and it jams there.

So after closer inspection, we noticed that on the reload, there was a dent near the nose where it had hit the feed ramp lip. We suspect that because the Federal Champion was FMJ, there was enough of a hard jacket to deflect off the lip and chamber itself. The plated lead being softer, it got caught on the feed ramp lip. The hollowpoint, not having a cone shaped nose, also got caught on the feed ramp. 

So why was this happening?

After closer inspection of the magazine follower, it looks like there isn't enough horizontal support to feed the round STRAIGHT into the ramp/chamber of the gun. All other rounds feed fine because there is another round below it providing full length horizontal support so that the bullet on top feeds straight and smooth into the gun. The last round however, does not have that same support from the follower, so as it is feeding out of the magazine, it takes a slight nose dive, causing it to hit the bottom lip of the ramp and jamming there.

Further research online shows that this is a proven problem, and all my reading has shown that this happens with the combination of a Glock 19 and magazines with followers numbered ""2183."" I've read that the 2183 followers work with G17s, but i'm guessing that's because since they are longer, the barrel and therefore feed ramp may be at a slightly different angle, so even if the last round dips, it feeds fine.

Here's a link to some different followers from Glock, and you can see that the 2183 has the least amount of support along the case of the bullet (it's merely a slight bump in the top right of the picture.) 

http://imgur.com/LKaMR

Please check your magazines and make sure they feed the last round of whatever ammo you are carrying. 

I'm sure Glock knows about this, and why they continue to ship Glock19s with these crappy followers really taints my view of the Glock name.

UPDATE: Calling glock is faster than emailing. I called, and got 3 new extractors shipped to me. Like others said, Glock is aware of this problem. 

TL:DR Magazine follower #2183 is trash, WILL CAUSE FAILURE TO FEED. Check yours, and call glock if needed for replacement. Google ""Glock 2138 FTF""

1349547338.0,47,self.Glocks,111u6j,The Great /r/Glocks Giveaway of 2012!!! Please upvote to the top so everyone can see - I receive no karma because this is a self-post. ,INEEDMILK,58,11,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/111u6j/the_great_rglocks_giveaway_of_2012_please_upvote/,"So we've hit 100+ subscribers, and in a much shorter period of time than I would have guessed (it took /r/Glock 2 years to get 195 readers...). As a special thanks to those of you who have joined me in laying the foundation for /r/Glocks, and as a promotional measure to encourage new content, I am going to host an in-house giveaway for our fledgling subreddit. 

The basic idea behind the competition is pretty simple: starting now, and ending on Monday, October 15th at 11:59 pm (EST), the user who has received the most karma for a submitted picture of his/her Glock will be declared the victor and will receive a brand new, official [Glock Armorers Tool](http://www.glockmeister.com/GLOCK-Armorers-Disassembly-Tool/productinfo/G3374).

The guidelines: 

- The picture **MUST** contain your Reddit username in some way. You could write it on a card and put it in the foreground, or have your Glock sitting in front of your computer with /r/Glocks open in the background, or you could write it in ammo, or stencil it on your slide, or whatever, as long as the image clearly shows that this a picture of your Glock, taken by you, for the purposes of posting on Reddit. **EDIT**: There seems to be some confusion about this rule, so I will do my best to explain it better: I want you to take a *new* picture of your Glock(s) with your username physically *written* somewhere in the shot. You could even load up /r/Glocks on an iPad and use that as a background, as long as /r/Glocks and/or your username is legible. 

- You may submit and delete/repost as many times as you would like, as long as each post contains only one picture, and that one picture is unique. 

- You may name your submission however you like; you need not specify that the image you are posting is for the giveaway. I will just assume that any picture submitted that follows the guidelines was intended to be recognized as part of the competition. 

- I recommend being creative with your image. While it is perfectly acceptable for you to submit a blurry cell-phone picture of your Glock 17 on a picnic table, it will most likely not win you the competition. If you have a rare or specialty Glock, such as an OD frame, Generation 2.5 or C RTF2, I would suggest using that as your submission. 

- You must live on the North American continent. I apologize if anyone feels excluded. 

- In the unlikely case of a tie in link karma, the post that has the most comment karma within it will be considered the winner. In the even-more-unlikely case of a tie in both link and comment karma, there will be a sudden-death vote-off showdown. 



If you have any questions regarding the rules, or have submitted a link that is not showing up, please feel free to send me a PM. 

Good luck, and long live /r/Glocks!!

1363972111.0,35,self.Glocks,1at49c,Do you have what it takes to be a CERTIFIED GLOCK ARMORER?,FirearmConcierge,54,19,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/1at49c/do_you_have_what_it_takes_to_be_a_certified_glock/,"I've been asked this question a few times this week regarding access to factory classes and instruction so I figured I should do post something useful in light of all the butthurt I have been causing. Yes, I'm aware it's a lot of butthurt.

FYI: I did my armorers class THREE YEARS AGO. I am due for re-certification in the last quarter of this year. The info that I have may be outdated but for the most part it stays the same. 

**HOW TO GET INTO THE CLASS:**

Simple. Be law enforcement, sponsored by an existing dealer, be a Glock dealer, or a GSSF member. For most of you - the GSSF membership will be the path of least resistance. 

**WHAT TO EXPECT:**

It's boring. Glocks are very simple to understand and operate and if you can put an iphone 4 in an otterbox, you will likely have no issue passing the class. It's 8 hours, first 4 hours are pretty boring and they cover the design, parts, history of the pistol, differences in model, breaking down the gun etc - you break for lunch - then you break down the guns again, do some review, the instructor tells you what material you need to know for the test. The test is closed book. You do not get notes or your armorers manual. If you pay attention, you will do fine. 

**WHAT SHOULD I BRING FOR LUNCH?**

I would ask Glock who is doing the catering. Get some solid intel because I had a questionable sammich with less than stellar gastrointestinal results. I would pack an emergency lunch in case the food they serve does not agree with you. Yes, I am being pedantic but if you get the caterer from hell you will thank me.

**WHAT SWAG DO I GET FROM THIS WONDERFUL MECCA OF FIREARM INSTRUCTION?**

Prepare to be disappointed. You get an armorers tool (NOTE: The factory armorers tool is useful but get a 3/32 punch from Sears. It's cheaper, easier to find and when it breaks AND YOU WILL BREAK IT ONE OF THESE DAYS, Sears will swap it for a Craftsman product off the shelf at no charge) with your armorers manual and US domestic supplement, and a GLOCK PERFECTION pen. Note that my pen did not work, so there was nothing perfect about it. They teach you how the guns run and you take a test. As my mother would say - you go to class to learn, not to make friends or have fun. 

I am told that you may be able to get a discounted gun but when I went through it - there was no written policy or anything about it. Your miles may vary but many manufacturers have killed discount programs to catch up on orders.

You get an orange slide cover plate that lets you check the engagement of the trigger bar cruciform and the striker because it is half the size of the normal plate. You'll use it once in a while to check the parts in question to see if they are out of spec, because when these parts go out of spec, bad things happen.

Hats are available for purchase as are DVD's with a power point presentation of slides and mechanics of operation. I bought the DVD, I would not spend money on it again. 

**HOW DO I FIND A CLASS NEAR ME?**

This is the Glock training schedule - https://www.glocktraining.com//Schedule.aspx

It SUCKS and is a pain to navigate. The only way you can sort the information is by date or by state. 

AC is standard armorers class, AA is advanced armorer (I am trying to take this, schedule permitting), IW is instructor workshop open to current armorers who have instructor creds through state or NRA and G18 is their Glock 18 course open only to those who own an 18. **MAKE SURE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE PROPER CLASS.** 

You'll note the following. There is ALWAYS a host - it can be an LE agency, a gun dealer, or a gunsmith school like CST. Venues vary. Know the terrain. 

There are so many that many can be found inside of a 1 hour drive, but there are a few issues. For instance, AA courses are the hardest to find and to get into. I really don't want to fly into Atlanta but looks like that is my easiest option. You typically CANNOT fly into a local airport the day of because they start at 8AM and they're not kidding about start time. You miss the start, you miss the class. There is zero chance of you being able to fly in day of unless you are on a red eye from the west coast and getting in at 6:15AM. Not that you're going to fly cross country on a mileage run just to keep your Delta Diamond Medallion status like my brother....

I digress. Back to the Glock training schedule....

**HOW TO GET INTO THE CLASS ROUND 2**

After taking into account the date, type of class, location, host - you have one other factor working against you. 

**CLASSES MAY BE CLOSED TO YOU IF YOU ARE NOT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT.** You may find the perfect class 20 minutes from your house on your day off and it is LE only. That sucks. **BUT WAIT! THERE'S HOPE!**

There's a few ""status"" modes for classes. Cancelled/Closed/Full/Restricted are self explanatory. 

**YOU WANT TO LOOK AT TWO THINGS: TIME TO CLASS AND EMPTY SEATS.**

This is important for a few reasons. Look at the classes offered in the next 5 days. A lot of them are closed/cancelled or full. You have to plan ahead. But you can't plan too far ahead. You're probably wondering why you don't want to be booking a class in July in March because you have to plan the fuck ahead, right?

Part of planning ahead is planning to procrastinate. 

**GLOCK WILL CANCEL THE CLASS IF CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE NOT MET. THEY REQUIRE 20 OR MORE TO DO THE CLASS. IF THEY ONLY HAVE 19, THEY WILL CANCEL IT.**

The criteria for a Glock class is: **They need 20 or more students.**

Max class size is 35, and what you see on the internet counts back from 35. If you only have 19 students (translate that to 16 open seats) = cancelled class. 

The rule is no more than 15 open seats. 

If they do not get their 20 students or have more than 15 empty seats, about three weeks prior to showtime **THEY WILL CANCEL THE CLASS** so plan, but don't plan too far ahead like buying nonrefundable plane tickets. If the class is filling up fast and they have under 15 empty slots, you can be pretty certain that class is a go. If there's 7 weeks to go and there's 32 empty slots - you can be pretty sure that's going to get the ax....

Which leads me to my next point.

**LE ONLY CLASSES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE AT LEAST 15 REGISTRATIONS 6 WEEKS BEFORE CLASS DATE - IF 15 ARE NOT MET, CLASS WILL BE OPENED TO ALL CATEGORIES TO TRY TO GET TO THE MINIMUM!**

So, if you do manage to find a class near you - that is LE only in 8 weeks and they do not have the 15 student minimum, wait two weeks to see if they fill the seats. If they do not fill the seats and they hit the 6 week mark, they will open to all categories and try to meet the minimum. Yes, it is a pain in the ass to watch this like a pot of boiling water but if the only class near you is LE only you have no choice.

**SO I HAVE PASSED THE ARMORERS CLASS WHAT CAN I DO WITH IT?**

Jack and shit, and jack done left town. You are the firearm version of the Maytag repairman. 

You are officially certified to fix an item that is branded as, marketed as and sold as the perfect be all end all solution to firearm consumers worldwide that is flawless and impossible to break that will deliver unsurpassed reliability for years and years to come (unless you bought a gen 4). 

You can order parts from the factory - but you can't just call Glock and order them. You have to have an order form emailed, mailed or faxed (ugh) to you and then you have to mail or fax (double ugh) the order form back to them. You can buy all sorts of nifty parts for your gun that won't break. Note: You do not get any discounts on anything and most of the time midway is going to be easier to deal with. The Glock factory sight tool does not work and should be avoided at all costs. They will not sell you ""-"" connectors so don't think you'll have access to those. Magazines are not orderable items. You can get barrels and small parts, aprons and a limited amount of armorer apparel but not much. 

Prepare to argue about glock technical speak on the internet as you frame and hang your xerox quality certificate on the wall next to your kindergarten diploma on your ego wall.

In short: Do it, don't do it - it's entirely up to you.

_________________________________________________

Dear Friend,
 
First of all, thank you for your business and thank you for your patience. The firearms industry has been inundated with orders for just about every type of handgun, AR rifle and magazines.
 
I just returned from the 2013 SHOT Show in Las Vegas, the big industry trade show. Here’s what I learned about the current availability of these items:
 
1)      Glock is back ordered 600,000+ handguns and over 1.5 million magazines

2)      AR magazines are back ordered over 2 million units from all manufactures

3)      Distributors are 2-3 weeks behind in shipping orders when their normal turn around time was 1-2 days
 
With that being said, we are receiving shipments of Glock handguns and magazines and AR rifles and magazines. However, our order volume has exceeded these shipments and these items are currently on back order. We do have some Glock handguns in stock.
 
Most other items are available, including holsters, Glock parts and accessories, Glock logo items and apparel, custom performance parts, etc...it is just taking us a bit longer than normal to process and ship these orders.
 
We ship orders in the order in which they were received. If you have placed an order for magazines…please be patient. Your credit card will not be charged until your order is ready to ship. I suggest you stay on our list and we will ship your order as soon as possible. 
 
Please do not call or email for a status update – especially if you ordered magazines - we want to ship your order and are doing everything we can to acquire these items and ship as soon as possible. Our phones are extremely busy and even with 45 people working here we are unable to answer every call or even answer every email in a timely manner.
 
I do apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We are currently hiring and training people to help us manage this huge influx of business.
 
I sincerely appreciate your trust and faith in our business. We value you as a customer and friend.
 
Thank you,

I won't go into details, but I will say that the people at [Ameriglo](http://www.ameriglo.net/catalog/sights/pistol-sights/glock) offer the best customer service in the industry as far as I'm concerned. They have earned a lifetime of my business.  

So in the interest of passing on my good fortune, I now have a set of Trijicon GL01s (the factory installed ones that came with my blue label Glock 19 RTF2 G) that I will give to someone in /r/Glocks. They are a little worn looking and the tritium vials are from 2009, but I assure you they are quite functional and will be for many more years to come. 

Winning these is simple: Post a comment in this thread with 1) a reason you don't already have night sights on your Glock, and 2) a picture of your Glock showing its lack of night sights. Be creative.

On Monday, June 3rd, I will pick what I think is the best comment and that person will receive a free set of [Trijicon GL01 BNT Night Sights](http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=GL01).

But for about the past 6 months I've really grown to appreciate the level of skill required to be accurate with a handgun. I shoot long range mostly, and I find handguns to be much more of a challenge. 

Any who, when I bought my first pistol I thought, I should get a Glock 19. But no, I want a single action trigger. So I picked up a CZ P07. It was great! Very accurate and comfortable. But there's 0 aftermarket support, and I should really get something more reliable to carry. I know! I should get a Glock 19. But no, it's ugly and everyone has one. So I picked up an M&amp;P. Gorgeous! Comfy! Can't hit jack with it! I know!! I'll get a Glock 19. But maybe I just suck with striker fired guns, and need a single action to be a decent shot. Here, I almost buy a 1911. 

BUT I resisted the urge to be different, and I actually bought a Glock 19. And it IS perfection. I'm just as accurate as I am with the CZ. It's only nearly as comfy as the M&amp;P, but it makes up for it by letting me forget it's there when I'm driving. And being able to hit a 10 inch target at 7 yards. Hell, I can shoot the staples out of the paper at 7 yards now. Why does anyone else try to make guns anymore? I understand the fanboyism now. I am a convert.

I have wanted a Glock 19 for quite some time now but either didn't have the money or didn't want to settle for something else. Here in California, they are particularly hard to get a hold of. I finally get the money together and start checking with local gun stores looking for one with no luck. 

Turners offered to put me on a waiting list that was about 100 people deep and could take anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks. in addition to that, I would have to wait 10 days to receive my gun. Another shop laughed and said good luck with that buddy, you might wait all year.  I took the day to think about it and in a last ditch effort I called a local mom and pop to see if they had any in. 

The guy on the phone says he's got 3 models in Dark Earth color. Not what I wanted, but I figured color is not important and it still is a very good looking gun. I get over there and check it out. I tell the guy that I had my heart set on black but I will take the Dark Earth model. He says give me a minute and heads to the back. He comes back with a brand new black Glock 19. I couldn't believe my luck.

Aced the HSC test and safe handling demonstration, having never handled or even fired a handgun before. Did all the necessary paperwork and this time next Tuesday I will have my Glock. Sorry for the wall of text, I am just so happy and most if not all of my friends don't share my enthusiasm. I am very excited to join you. 

TL;DR: Got a Glock 19 on a whim after being told that it would take forever to get one. ",,False,self,t5_2v6xn,False,,,True,t3_1hvb6o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/1hvb6o/finally_getting_my_glock_19/,

I have little experience with guns, so I may have some questions which may seem incredibly stupid.  I apologize in advance.

First, anything I should do before bringing it out shoot? Clean it or anything?

Second, may be real dumb, but I load the full mag, pull back to cock it and it is loaded and ready correct?  Do I ease the top back into place, or just let it fly? Would letting it fly cause it to fire?

Third, how would you suggest storing it?

Fourth, anything else a newbie should know?

 This post is designed to answer the most common questions about the different GLOCK training model pistols. The pistols below are mine. There are different variations and generations, like all other models.

 _____________**The Glock 17 T**_____________

 We will start with the “T” models. The most common is the G17T. The G17T comes in two calibers; the 9mmFX (more commonly known as “simunitions”) and the 7.8x21AC. The 9mmFX is a center fire cartridge and is the most common of the G17T. The 7.8x21AC is an air compressed cartridge. GLOCK says it exists, but to this date I have never seen one nor even found a picture of one. In addition to the G17T, I have seen pictures of a G19T, so other “T” models may exist. 


 The “T” models are considered real firearms, thus, all federal, state and local laws apply. They are legal to own (depending on your jurisdiction), but are available from GLOCK to LE only. They do pop up for sale from time to time in various places.


 This is the G17T. Obviously, you can see that the “T” models are blue.

http://i.imgur.com/YOCwknR.jpg

 This is the left side of the slide, denoting that it is a G17T and is chambered in 9mmFX.

http://i.imgur.com/GafdUPG.jpg

 This is the right side of the slide, warning you that the pistol is designed for training.

http://i.imgur.com/urmcrJZ.jpg

 All of the “T” models get a serial prefix of “T” followed by numbers. The “T” prefix is reserved for “T” models only and is not found on any other model.

http://i.imgur.com/C6NuqcR.jpg

 Interestingly, this is a 3rd Generation frame, but the “T” has yet to get the third pin.

http://i.imgur.com/vy4A0IW.jpg

 This is the muzzle of the 9mmFX barrel. You can see how it is offset to the top. 

http://i.imgur.com/tLNc5Cw.jpg

 The G17T uses a regular 9mm magazine, though it comes with a blue magazine baseplate.

http://i.imgur.com/a41aRKH.jpg

 The G17T does have it’s own recoil spring assembly and part number.

http://i.imgur.com/AP2bukx.jpg

 The G17T barrel has a much longer feed ramp and is rifled.

http://i.imgur.com/dHRRLBO.jpg

 The G17T firing pin tip is offset to the bottom.

http://i.imgur.com/UQxJtNz.jpg

 The G17T has a unique locking block.

http://i.imgur.com/2KjpQVj.jpg

 Here is the locking block, removed from the frame.

http://i.imgur.com/XckX7UH.jpg

 Aside from these noted differences, most other parts are the same as most other models.

 _____________**The Glock 22 P**_____________

 Next are the “P” models. The most common is the G22P. The G22P is of course chambered in .40 S&amp;W. I do know that there are other “P” models, though the G22P is what is most common. The “P” models are basically dummies used for training safely. With a few parts changes, they can be fired.


 The “P” models are considered real firearms, thus, all federal, state and local laws apply. They are legal to own (depending on your jurisdiction), but are available from GLOCK to LE only. They do pop up for sale from time to time in various places.


 This is the G22P. Obviously, you can see that the “P” models are red.

http://i.imgur.com/8o42yEf.jpg

 This is the left side of the slide, denoting that it is a G22P and is chambered in .40.

http://i.imgur.com/OBLStRS.jpg

 The G22P has a serial prefix of “PJ..” Only the “P” and “R” (explained later) have the “PJ” prefix.

http://i.imgur.com/qIWSRoK.jpg

 This is the muzzle of the G22P, no…no tiny bullet pops out here. The barrel is mostly solid. I’ll explain below.

http://i.imgur.com/tiglmS6.jpg

 Though the barrel is solid on a G22P, it does have a chamber (for use with dummy rounds). In the event that you do load live ammunition (there are more fail safes, explained below) and it does happen to fire, this hole will help disperse the pressure, presumably.

http://i.imgur.com/SVnhjTF.jpg

 Here is the side of the barrel. As you can see, it has holes. This is for weight reduction to make the firearm point and weigh like a real G22.

http://i.imgur.com/J5o2fn7.jpg

 The G22P uses a normal G22 magazine. It does normally come with a black magazine baseplate. I added the orange for distinction.

http://i.imgur.com/jgFjWXR.jpg

 The G22P firing pin has no point.

http://i.imgur.com/ydFPwEH.jpg

 The G22P breech face has no hole for the firing pin to protrude.

http://i.imgur.com/L7ZmMXn.jpg

 _____________**The Glock 17 R**_____________

 Next are the “R” models. The most common is the G17R. I don’t know if there are any other “R” models other than the G17R. The G17R is chambered in 9x19. This pistol is designed so that the trigger resets after each pull, without racking the slide. It can be used with a laser integrated system or for general dry fire practices and other dummy practices.


 The “R” models are considered real firearms, thus, all federal, state and local laws apply. They are legal to own (depending on your jurisdiction), but are available from GLOCK to LE only. They do pop up for sale from time to time in various places.


 This is the G17R. Obviously, you can see that the “R” models are red.

http://i.imgur.com/fF3bAGX.jpg

 This is the left side of the slide, denoting that it is a G17R and is chambered in 9x19.

http://i.imgur.com/d5bU68I.jpg

 This is the right side of the slide with the warning that the firearm is a practice sample.

http://i.imgur.com/FktklyV.jpg

 This is the G17R serial prefix of “PJ.” Only the “R” and “P” models will have a “PJ” prefix.

http://i.imgur.com/v7sKGII.jpg

 The G17R uses regular G17 magazines, though I added the orange base plate for identification.

http://i.imgur.com/zwtT5IX.jpg

 The G17R has a regular, 9x19 rifled barrel.

http://i.imgur.com/8MBSit4.jpg

 The G17R firing pin has no point.

http://i.imgur.com/hXW6MrQ.jpg

 The G17R firing pin (top) is much longer than a standard firing pin (bottom).

http://i.imgur.com/qnxDVqK.jpg

 The G17R breech face has no hole for the firing pin to protrude.

http://i.imgur.com/GFGN10P.jpg

 The G17R has a unique trigger spring.

http://i.imgur.com/Nz7mwtI.jpg

 _____________**The Glock Cutaway Models**_____________

 As for the last training model that GLOCK makes, we will discuss the “cutaway models.” The cutaways are available to armorers and LE, IIRC. The cutaways come in nearly every model, depending on GLOCK’s mood.


 The cutaway models are considered real firearms, thus, all federal, state and local laws apply. They are legal to own (depending on your jurisdiction), but are available from GLOCK to LE and armorers only. They do pop up for sale from time to time in various places.


 This is my very early cutaway G19. Someone foolishly decided to poorly polish it. I keep meaning to have it re-coated, but haven’t don’t it, yet. Though, what better model than a cutaway to prove the toughness of GLOCK’s metal treatment? 


 This is the G19 cutaway.

http://i.imgur.com/oqAivJy.jpg

 This is the left side of the slide, denoting that this model is a G19 and is chambered in 9x19.

http://i.imgur.com/ySR9YaH.jpg

 This is the right side of the slide, warning you that the firearm is a cutaway sample.

http://i.imgur.com/J4uWVdM.jpg

 Only the cutaway samples get a “JQ” serial prefix.

http://i.imgur.com/txZmofa.jpg

 Here is a general pic of the left side of the gun.

http://i.imgur.com/aJXnmAy.jpg

 This is the side of the frame, so that you can see the magazine, which is also cutaway.

http://i.imgur.com/4463R1r.jpg

 Leaving nothing to the imagination, GLOCK wants you to see how the magazine catch spring moves to the side.

http://i.imgur.com/oyjMApc.jpg

 Here is the side of the magazine, showing the magazine spring.

http://i.imgur.com/IB5350Q.jpg

 Other than the side, the magazine is the same as a normal magazine (though this one is earlier).

http://i.imgur.com/vTsRrT1.jpg

 Here is a top view of the cutaway internals of the frame.

http://i.imgur.com/vYMLPxg.jpg

 The cutaway firing pins have no point.

I soon found that I was having difficulty putting groups in a pie plate at 15 feet.  The instructor had me try his Glock 17.  Within 15 minutes I was putting three inch groups centering on the bulls eye at 15 feet.  Needless to say, I ran out and purchased a Glock 17. I got a great Front Line holster and began carrying where ever I went.

Today I visited my local branch of Bank of America to do some business.   Two hours later, a man in a hoodie entered the bank, brandished a gun, and made off with an undisclosed amount of cash.  Thankfully, nobody was injured, but the robber is still at large.

I'm thankful I was carrying a handgun that I could be accurate with if I really had to.  I'm off to the range tomorrow for some more practice….",,False,self,t5_2v6xn,False,,,True,t3_19w3w8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/19w3w8/glock_accuracy/,

Shot several hundred rounds of Winchester White Box and a couple (20ish total) of different JHP rounds yesterday. One of the most enjoyable range trips I've had. G19 functioned beautifully, minus a few brass casings to the face.

I decided to clean it right when I got home. Unfortunately, even after reading the manual and watching several videos on Glock fieldstripping and cleaning I fucked up. In a fit of temporary stupidity, I hit the [circled areas](http://i.imgur.com/ws3cSkl) with a sold spray of Break-Free CLP. I let it sit for a handful of minutes before I realized my mistake and spent the rest of the afternoon wiping it down, trying to remove the CLP. I also field-stripped it again this morning and wiped it down. I'm pretty sure it got on the breech face and in and around the firing channel. Like I said, I'm a moron. Dumb, stupid beginner's mistake.

I know that excessive lubrication and oil can cause grime to collect in those areas, ultimately causing light strikes (obviously not a good thing.) I don't think I used nearly enough CLP to cause a major issue, but I just wanted to be sure. I wasn't even planning on posting until I functioned checked the Glock after reassembly (on both days) and noticed a perfect little pin-sized drop of oil on the SnapCap primers.

AIC and questions,Calvus,18,0,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/18rl0i/joined_the_glock_family_this_weekend_aic_and/,"First things first... [Here's the album](http://imgur.com/a/UOaor). It's a Glock 27. I bought it off an individual for $550, which included: gun, 4 mags, 40 rounds of ammo, cheap IWB holster, and a Clipdraw. I took a LEO from work with me (who happens to be a Glock nut) for safety and so he could look at the gun to see if it was worth getting. The seller that it had been fired roughly 200 times, but I take this with a grain of salt. Parts are easily changed, however it is a pretty clean gun.

I haven't shot it yet (been incredibly busy), but look forward to it. This is my 2nd handgun ever, but my first in years. I see a lot of practice in my future.

I have some questions though. I'm confused as to what generation this is, and if the .357 mag will work.

I first noticed that the mag was stamped with the .357 designator the day after I got the gun. I think the seller had a G32 (or is it G33?) for sale as well, and assume that either the mag got mixed up or he didn't noticed. The mag does ""click"" in and feels solid while in the mag well. I had just finished loading the mag when I noticed the stamp. In doing some quick research it appears that the .357 Glock and G27 are pretty much the same gun, excluding caliber. Wikipedia stated that if the barrels were swapped out my G27 would fire .357 ammo and the .40 mags would work on the .357 Glock.

Now before I actually try this, can anyone confirm? I figure if anything fails it would probably be feeding the ammo into the chamber.

As for the generation, I'm really confused. I'm basing all of this off the glockstore.com video of how to tell the difference between Gen3 and Gen4.

Gen3 features are as follows:

* Small mag release

* Gen4 not stamped on slide

* Mag release appears to not be ambidextrous

* Back strap on grip is NOT interchangeable 

Gen 4 features:

* Double spring on guide rod

* Large hole on front of slide

* Wider U shape on front of slide

I called Glock and spoke to a woman who asked for the serial (they all match up). She said that it was manufactured in July 2009 and was a Gen4. I'm not convinced. I say Gen3.

So, tell me what you think. I look forward to spending more time with you fellow Glockies-Glockians-whatever you call yourself.",,False,self,t5_2v6xn,False,,,True,t3_18rl0i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/18rl0i/joined_the_glock_family_this_weekend_aic_and/,

Some things were to be expected, like ARs priced between $1,700-$3,600, most were used. But then I saw a NIB Colt AR going for $6,350, and two mil-spec AR complete lowers for $700 each. I saw glock 19 mags going for $75 and 33rnd mags for $175 at one booth, and I saw a new mavrick 88 going for $399.  The sickest thing, some people were buying at these prices. I didn't find one reasonably priced thing in the house. 

Out of the three guns shops nearest to me, the closest was there with horrible prices, I walked up to a couple of the employees I recognized from that shop and let them know I would no longer be supporting the business because of price gouging, they don't set the prices, the owner does, but I wanted to send the message. 

Of the other two stores, one doesn't participate in gun shows, and the other actually buys space at the show, parks a large military truck in their booth space, with a banner that states, ""tired of these prices? Come into our store where everything is priced at everyday low prices.""

Needless to say, there are only two gun shops That will see my business.

I don't care to buy a .45 or a 10mm so I was sort of looking into .40 or .357 SIG. However, I am wondering why it seems like nobody really shoots the G31, 32, or 33 with .357 SIG. 

Obviously 9mm and .40 are most common, but I figured I'd ask why nobody chooses the .357 Glocks. I have done some reading and watched my share of videos and the only downside that I've seen is the price in ammo, but I haven't checked out prices all that much yet. So, does anybody here own a G31, 32, or 33 that can give me some insight on the matter, or maybe someone just wants to pursway me into the .40 instead? Any info would be appreciated.

I learned a lot about shooting in general and most importantly how to train properly with the time and ammo that I have. Learning to train until my performance peaks and then stopping will be a challenging adaptation for me but I think it will pay some massive dividends.

My Glock performed very well. The trigger seemed to smooth out just a little bit as I noticed the point at which the gun goes off changed after the first day. I used to take the slack to ""the wall"" and then press a short distance after that and the gun would fire. Now I notice that short distance has gotten closer to where the slack ends and as a result the gun is much easier to shoot. I don't think it's a result of refinement of my trigger control as mechanically it definitely feels different.

Ammunition I ran was Black Hills Ammo 115gr factory remanufactured.

The only real hiccups I had were that sometimes the slide wasn't locking to the rear after the last round was fired. The cause wasn't the Glock or the magazine, it was my grip. My hands were high on the gun so sometimes my thumb would ride the slide stop/release not allowing the slide to lock back. I did notice that the squared off area of the trigger guard close the the magazine release was digging furiously into my middle finger and the slide serrations would dig into the side of my thumb since my grip was so high. Taping my middle finger and thumb definitely helped and I may consider reducing that edge just a little bit on the trigger guard. No malfunctions aside from the ones I set up during drills and no brass to the face.

If anyone is looking to take classes like these I can wholeheartedly reccomend Costa Ludus. If anyone has questions on the training or prepping for it feel free to ask.

So I bought one of those rubber sleeves that you put on top of the grip.

So far it's very good and I haven't had any problems with it, but many people at my range told me that what happens is that the rubber sleeve starts to slide upwards and then it will eventually block the mag release button or even press the mag release by accident.

Is this true? Has anyone got one of these sleeves and noticed this problem?

I am not sure if anyone has came across this problem before but I am hoping someone has. Also, I am trying to research this via Google.

A few weeks back I purchased a stainless steel guide rod and a [GHOST](http://i.imgur.com/yeV8u.jpg) 3.5LB trigger connector for my Glock 17 off of Amazon. Prior to installing these 2 pieces, my firearm shot flawlessly. 

Yesterday afternoon I went out to the desert to test fire my pistol and the very first time I squeezed the trigger 3 rounds popped off. I thought WTF? Dropped the mag, emptied the chamber and field stripped the pistol. Nothing looked off and as far as I could tell everything was in working order. There was plenty of lubricant, no metal shavings so I put it back together, installed magazine and continued to fire. I got bursts almost every time I pulled the trigger in the 2-4 bullet range. I shot 1 - 10 round magazine. Then I loaded 8 bullets into a 17 round mag and the same problem happened so I ceased fire, not wanting to break any components in my firearm or harm myself.


Could the trigger connector be the problem here? I did not have a chance to put the stock one back in and try it because all that stuff was at home and it was getting dark. Tonight I will clean the whole gun, including firing pin and give it another shot with the stock connector. Any suggestions would help!

I was shooting Winchester white box 115 grain 9mm FMJ.

EDIT: This is a Gen 3 Glock 17. It was cleaned before this instance, so residue built up could not be the culprit.",,False,self,t5_2v6xn,1352820222.0,,,True,t3_134h1c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/134h1c/g17_full_auto_24_round_bursts/,

It has a smooth take up then you hit more resistance and then a crisp break. The reset is even nicer.

Well, I just got a Gen 4 17 and the trigger is different... it still has a smooth take up, then the resistance, but then instead of a clean break there is some creep. Even when using the reset, there is some mush before it breaks.

I'm fortunate enough to live right near Glockmeisters, and was in there the other day describing this to them. The guy knew what I was talking about, and said if I brought it in they'd install a factory 4.5lb connector and a ""competition"" trigger spring and the trigger would be just like the gen 3 and half a pound or so lighter. After doing some research into the gen 4 trigger I'm reading many conflicting opinions online as to what is the fix.

Does anyone have any suggestions or should I just bring it in to Glockmeisters and have them do their thing? I really have no interest in lightening the trigger as it's for carry/HD (I suppose half a pound is ok), I just want it to be like my gen 3 19. Thanks!

**UPDATE: Got the Gen 3 trigger bar installed at Glockmeisters and the trigger is almost the same as my 19, if not a bit lighter/smoother. There is still a TINY bit of creep before the break but it's barely noticable.**",,False,self,t5_2v6xn,1376361946.0,,,True,t3_1k6xwk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/1k6xwk/suggestions_for_improving_gen_4_17_trigger/,

2. I would rather sell it on armslist over gunbroker because I don't want to dealing with ffl or fees. What do i need to sell a gun? Would a bill of sale be necessary? And what do those consist of?

3. I'm 6'2 and 165 lbs, would i be able to conceal a 19? I would much rather have a 19 over a 26 because it's just more comfortable in my hand and probably more comfortable to shoot regularly at the range.

Is a 9mm Glock frame the best option to go with? My reasoning is the [somewhat] increase availability of ammunition, price effectiveness, and lethality.

If 9mm is the best, is the Glock 19 my best bet? I doubt I'll own more than one pistol at a time. I would like to pursue a CCW but probably not right away. 

Glock 19 is compact and good for CCW, no?

Currently residing in Kansas, and unfortunately I deploy shortly after I turn 21, so I won't have long to enjoy my purchase before I take off in to the sunset. What are some things I should get in order and prepare for to expedite the purchasing of a handgun?

I doubt I'll pursue CCW before I leave. How can I try different holsters to find what's right for me? What holsters would you guys recommend? I **do not** like my drop holster for my m9.

I bought this Gen 3 17 brand new in mid June thinking that I most likely keep it forever. It saddens to say that I will be selling it this afternoon. So in memory I want to give it a little remembrance. My 17 is not a thing of beauty but I loved it all the same. I bought her to shoot and shoot is what she did. The round count for her sits at 1720 rounds of nothing but Russia's finest offerings. I mean not one round of brass case has been through it since I have owned it, and it has performed perfectly. Not to mention the thousands of rounds that the frame has held double duty for my .22 conversion. It was my guinea pig in learning how to take apart a Glock, and has more random trigger bars, various springs, and buffing of things then I can recall and she did all this without complaint.

So you may ask why am I selling the old friend? How can I just abandoned the ol girl like that? Well to tell the truth I'm trading her in on a nicer model http://i.imgur.com/i9GRx.jpg[/IMG]

However, around that time their official stance changed to ""you should use a snap cap to dry fire"", even though a dry fire is required to disassemble the pistol.

It isn't much more than an annoyance but I still have to rack the slide back to shake out the round.  I'm wondering if it's me, the gun, or the ammo I'm shooting.  I know that glocks can suffer from limp-wrist malfunctions more easily than other heavier pistols, but I feel like my grip is pretty firm.  Also, usually with limp-wrist stovepipes, it's usually the brass of the round that was just fired that get's caught.  I haven't ever heard of my type of malfunction before, but I might get it once every few mags.  I am using reloaded brass (from Redline ballistics), but a few other people I know that have shot this ammo haven't had any problems with it.

tl;dr- I'm not sure why my G17 sometimes halfway ejects my next round.

Help?

UPDATE: I went to the range today and put about 250 rounds downrange.  I noticed that when I really focus on my stance, there is hardly an issue with the stovepipes.  However, towards the end of the time, I started to get more fatigued with my grip and noticed more and more ejection issues, almost 1 or 2 per 10 rounds.  I guess this goes to show that it was really me, and not my ammo or gun that has been causing this issue.  My buddy who is much more physically strong than I am never had a problem with it, so I'm confident I just need to work on my stamina and stance.  One issue that we all experienced today though is a lot of brass to face, neck, and chest. I wonder if it was because I needed to clean the gun, or if I need a new ejector/extractor.

A couple hours later I finally got a real response. ""Ok, your order has been cancelled"". I am blown away at their customer service, and how willing they were to lose a client.

I'm getting ready to purchase my first Glock and just wanted to get the community's opinion on my decision. First of all, to give you background, I'm a beginner shooter with limited experience shooting handguns. My primary reason for wanting to buy a handgun/Glock is for recreational purposes and the possibility of me going to the police academy/FBI academy. My intentions of wanting to buy a Glock is for practice, so I get better at shooting, when and if I do go to an academy. Seeing as how Glock 17's/22's are standard issue, I'm going with the safe route. However, because of the cost of ammo, I wanted to get the Glock 17.

Apparently I've chosen to buy a gun at the wrong time because all stores seem to be sold out on Glock 17s and I'd prefer to buy my gun in person. My dilemma is if I should buy a Glock 22 and buy a conversion (like the lone wolf conversion to 9mm) so that I could shoot with cheaper ammo. Has anyone encountered risks to using an aftermarket conversion? Will this in anyway put my investment at risk if I were to do this?

As of this Friday, I will be the proud owner of a Glock 17 Gen 3. I got it with Trijicon Night Sights and an extended slide release. I'm new to r/Glocks but I've been lurking here and there for a bit and had a few questions. Thanks in advance for any and all advice! 

My main uses for this gun will be home defense but I want to get to the range as much as I possibly can. 

- I'm planning on buying two extra mags to start off. Is that enough or can you never have too many mags? 

- Aside from night sights and extended slide release, what are some extras you recommend? (I don't plan on changing things right away. I want to put a few hundred to 1k rounds through its first so I really get to know the gun and see what I like/don't like.) 

- What sort of ""accessories"" do you suggest or recommend? I was thinking of possibly getting a light at some point down the line, but I don't ""need"" one right now. What about range bags? Cleaning kits? Eye/ear Pro? Etc. 
- What about ammo for home defense? I've done a bit of reading and have been buying some when I can find it (Hornady Critical Defense/Duty, Winchester PDX1, Federal Hydra-Shok, Speer Gold Dots) but I want to know what the Glock community recommends. Also, what's some good range ammo? Any brands to avoid altogether? Home defense or otherwise? The highest I've gotten is +P. Should I avoid shooting reloads or does that really matter with a Glock? 

- I don't have a big safe (yet) but I did buy a drawer safe/lock box. 

If there's anything else you think I might want to pick up or that you think I've missed, I'd love to hear it. 

Thanks much. It's nice to finally be part of the family. :)

I came across a posting for a Gen 3 with 4mags one being a fun stick for $425.00 so i emailed the guy my info. About an hour later i get a call from a guy who sounded 16. I could care less as long as everything checks out and he isn't actually 16. So we start the deal process I'm asking questions and the whole 9 yards. Everything sounds good so i want to meet up and possibly buy the gun. Towards the end of the conversation he starts to tell me he now wants $500 and i naturally ask why. Turns out this fool listened to his buddy and proceeded to ruin the thing by doing a ""custom stippling job"" in hopes of getting more for it. I go on to tell him he ruined the gun and would be lucky to get $375 - $400. He insists that it looks great and provides a awesome grip surface. I pretty much said what most of us would of about how it was a bad idea and there are grips to help if needed plus he should of kept it factory since he.was selling it. Now here is where it gets kinda funny but also kinda sad. The guy must have been 16 because the thing out of his mouth was how it's the highest quality plastic gun made in Germany and that glocks are made with such advanced plastics that they can pass through a metal detector with out setting it off. I almost lost it and before I hung up I said to check a globe because he has his countries messed up and WTF does he think the barrel and slide are made of.... I never thought I would come across someone that stupid and sure in hell not someone with a firearm. Now that i think back the kid must have been underage and the gun was probably stolen. The only reason i say it was possibly stolen was the area he wanted to meet up was in the ghetto and i dont think a actual firearm owner could be so stupid when it comes to info about their weapon plus he fucking stippled the thing....

Anyways I thought the whole ordeal was kinda fucked up so I thought I would share. Anyone have any similar stories?

As an additional point of reference, if the slide is pulled back and let gently forward it will sometimes hang up and not return all the way back home. This does not occur if done quickly. Stiff new gun? Ideas?

I was a little hesitant at first to purchase this firearm, but it has proved to be very reliable.  The gun was bought in July and I have just hit the 1500 round mark on it.  The ammo has been a mix of 900 Federal FMJ, 300 WWB, 100 Tula Steel Case and 200 Hornady Critical Duty 135gr +P.  There have been zero malfunctions.  Its cleaning regiment was after every range trip.  The highest round count was 350 before it was cleaned, I know it isn’t much but I can’t stand a dirty weapon.   

Not all of the rounds through this were range trips, I did shoot a GSSF “competition” with the G17 and did fairly well with just a stock gun placing 11th.  After shooting the competition and this many rounds I want to start to change some things.  The first thing that will be going is the stock sights.  Terrible is being nice to these.  The plastic got dinged up and it hasn’t even seen a holster yet.  After that it will be more magazines and a trigger.  While, I like the stock trigger, I want something lighter.  After shooting this gun for 1500 rounds, it is showing some wear.  The Glock smile started to show at about 1200 rounds.  I didn’t think this was supposed to happen on the Gen 4 barrels but it’s beginning on mine.  Also underneath the barrel is definite wear from the recoil spring, I haven’t seen this on my friends gen 3 guns so it was unexpected.  Wear is also showing on the slide lock and guide rails on the frame however it is minimal on the rails.  

While 1500 rounds isn’t a lot for some shooters, it has taught me a lot about the gun in terms of what it can do and what I want different.   I plan on making the changes to my gun and running it in USPSA or 3 gun this coming summer.

I've had my Gen 4 Glock 26 for a little over a year now and haven't had a single hiccup through about 2,000 rounds. Now I want a Glock in .45. 

I have a 1911, but let's be honest, it's no Glock. I went to my LGS yesterday and they only had 2 Glock 21SFs in stock. I asked if they were expecting any Gen 4 G21s and he said that there really isn't any demand for them so they keep the G21 SFs. (I insisted on the Gen 4 after seeing the 21SF spring housing and wanting the interchangeable backstraps). I was also told that the Gen 4 spring ""slowed"" the gun and lowered the potential ROF.

I called 2 other gun stores today and they both told me they only carried G21SFs because there wasn't any demand for Gen 4 G21s. I finally got a hold of a store that says they have Gen 4 G21s and they're selling them fairly cheap compered to what I heard from the other gun stores.

Am I missing something here? Is there a defect in this model that makes it less in-demand than the G21SF?

Normally with dry fire you have to manually cycle the slide which forces you to break your grip every shot you dry fire. This trainer actually incorporates a laser into the dry fire training and does not require you to manually cycle the slide in order to get a good reset and follow through on the trigger. For any folks like me in a colder state sometimes winter gets in the way of training so you end up dry firing. For me this is not a good option just yet as the G17/22 is a bit large for me so I run the G19.

Long story short, I've been checking on upcoming GSSF matches and saw that there is one local to me (WA) in September.


Is there anyone here who could give a breakdown of how a day at a GSSF match goes (How attended these are on average, etc)?


I know there are many other blogs/videos I could read and watch, but was hoping to hear firsthand from people about their experiences at GSSF matches - especially if you can recall your first GSSF match, what it was like, how it is similar (or different) from other pistol matches that you may have been a part of, etc.  Basically, any thoughts/insight regarding GSSF matches would be greatly appreciated.


Also, if there is anyone else from WA who has been to several GSSF matches and is planning on going to the one in September, would you be cool if I was your shadow for the day (I'll probably only be able to make Saturday)?  I am still blocking out my calendar to see if I will even be able to make it to this match, but figured it can't hurt to see if any other local WA Glock owners would be heading over to the event.

I've been keeping up with the sub for a while now and have enjoyed all of your Glocks.  I'm wanting get started, but I can't really decide which model I want or even which caliber!

I'm essentially debating between a 9mm or 45acp fullsize or competition.  I'm a recreational shooter, I'm set on carry and home defense - so there's no distinct purpose other than I want to add a glock to the collection via the Blue Label program.

I currently don't have anything in 9mm, which strikes me as an opportunity to branch into a new NATO caliber.  (I've typically stuck with the standard/popular calibers so far - .223, 30-06, .22, .357, 45acp, 12ga, etc).  

I'm interested in competitive shooting, but simply don't have the time currently, but I enjoy training.

So what are your thoughts on Gen4 vs Gen3 and competition models vs standard?

Also, I've seen people being able to switch out calibers/slides - what range of possibilities are available?  Only 9mm/40 or could a standard 17 take a 45acp setup?

---------------
TL;DR: I want a Blue Label glock - probably 9mm or 45acp; competition or full size, which generation?  

Thanks for your opinions!

Yes, I could google, but I am asking YOU because I am comfortable relying on reddit advice over being a bystander on some other forums.

I own a few handguns.  No glocks.  Want to get a 29.  Thinking gen4 because that new recoil setup can't be bad...that's about it, price isn't too different between it and the gen3/3SF.

I am looking for guidance regarding a few general glock questions:

* Is it realistic to say I will never ever clean my glock (figure 1000rds a year) and expect it to always function?

* Will occasional salt water damage a glock? Are the metal parts resistant to salt? Anyone know of an aftermarket coating that they would trust their life on?

* I have heard of modifications for the trigger pull weight - are they going to effect reliability? I would like to knock the 5.5# down a little if possible.

* I understand cast boolits are not recommended for the polygonally-rifled glock barrels, but how many shots would be allowable before the rifling is stuffed with run-off? Can it be cleaned or does it 'melt' in? Do most guys (and gals!) just get a lone wolf barrel before shooting any cast ammo?

* I want to go with night sights or a fiber front sight or something like that; for the 29 it seems that's aftermarket only.  Could anyone offer guidance or is anyone here a dealer that wants to quote a price for options?

Does anyone have feedback on the 29SF vs 29gen4 that they would like to share? A few mm's here and there don't sound like a lot, and I'm sure I'll find they both fit me fine.

Can anyone recommend a holster that would work for concealment and allow for a light? Assuming not, can anyone recommend a regular OWB holster that would allow for a light?  And then, anyone want to recommend a light? Was thinking the cheaper streamlight at some point.

I suppose that's really it.  I thank you all for any feedback, answers, comments, or the like.  

**TLDR** How much can I abuse a glock?

It's pretty bad. Both guns were probably severely over oiled at one point. If I separate the slide from the frame and remove the spring and barrel, my fingers are already covered in black. There is crud up and down the slide rails, and the mechanisms inside of the frame are coated in black (carbon?). 

I looked over the side bar and reviewed the video there regarding cleaning. It only had instructions for a very light cleaning with a toothbrush with no solvent or anything on it, and I don't think there's any way that will be sufficient in this case.

I'm confident I can detail strip the gun and get all the parts out without any issues by looking at the exploded parts diagram and following a step by step video. I'm not so confident on cleaning it, I have no real knowledge base there.

What am I going to need and how am I going to do it? I already have isopropyl alcohol, q-tips, and paper towels from other every day tasks. I don't have oil or solvent. What brands or types do I need and where can I get them?

After I have the gun completely apart and I have the required supplies, what's next? Should I just start dropping parts in solvent wholesale and leave it for a while? Should I apply solvent to a tooth brush and then scrub each individual part? How should I clean the inside of the frame after the parts are removed? How should I use the alcohol after the solvent is done? Do I need solvent in the first place? What do I do here, what do I do there, how do I do this, how do I do that...

After the cleaning is done, what should I do with the oil?

Also, is any of this information good for a Springfield XD? If not, can you point me in the right direction?

I have an idea of what needs to be done but no knowledge of how to do it successfully. I had considered Google or YouTube, but I came to the conclusion that every jackass with a pistol is going to be posting up something and I'd rather not get bad information.

Just an update after ~700 rounds through my Glock 22FDE4. First handgun, and honestly probably my first ~700 rounds shooting a handgun. I absolutely love this weapon! I did my research before making a purchase and am really glad I did. The target in the album is by far my best shooting; first 100 rounds through anything but accurate. I added a grip force adapter because apparently I have fat hands and was experiencing slide bite. The adapter does its job; no slide bite and IMHO the weapon feels more comfortable with it, however appearance could improve. Sights are Ameriglo Hackathorns with tritium insert in front only. To practice when not at the range I dry fire as often as possible, of course checking and rechecking the chamber + safe direction POA. 

TL;DR

I will soon be in the market for a new handgun upon PCSing back to the US. My current handgun collection is a Kimber Pro-Carry II, and a S&amp;W M&amp;P40. Obviously neither of these are the ideal form factor for someone 5'8""/29"" Waist and 135lbs to carry concealed. This is why I come to you fine gentlemen.

I have yet to own a glock but have had the pleasure of firing a few, however this was 2+ years ago. My brother suggested looking at a G26 as a carry option, but my main concern is the width. I read many posts regarding how wide glocks are, but I honestly can't remember my experience that specific. I wish it was as easy as going down to the LGS and handling one, but I'm currently stationed in the U.K. and am unable to do so.

1358195027.0,9,self.Glocks,16kjhe,Just read Glock: The Rise of America's Gun. Way better read than I had expected. Favorite highlights inside. cr from r/guns,Mr_Budha,14,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Glocks/comments/16kjhe/just_read_glock_the_rise_of_americas_gun_way/,"So I just finished reading Glock: Rise of America’s Gun by Paul M. Barret and I thought I would share some of my highlights with you all. First off if you enjoy history and you love firearms this is a must read. I was truly surprised by what a great read this book was. It is chalked full of useful information and much of the politics, tragedies, and bans that the book covers is happening all over again right now with most of the same big players. So I’ll leave a comment or two but here are some of my favorite highlights:

“In 1983, the Ministry of Defense ordered twenty thousand Glock 17s.”

    It was interesting to read about how Glock beat out over all the established companies such as Beretta and Sig for the Austrian contract. Especially since Gaston Glock was literally some random Austrian Engineer who just decided to build a pistol for the govt.

“No other country finds so much history, emotion, belief, vice, and virtue in so many guns.”

    Henry Allen talking about guns in American culture.

“In many ways, Gaston Glock became the Sam Colt of the twentieth century. It is an assertion that might offend some American handgun historians and revolver loyalists. But it is no exaggeration to say that a pair of Austrians – a reticent engineer and his ambitious salesman-set about to remake the handgun business in the United States.”

“ I will never forget how it felt to hold a loaded gun for the first time and lift it and fire it, the scare of its animate kick up the bone of your arm, you are empowered there is no question about it, it is an investiture, like knighthood, and even though you didn’t invent it or design it or tool it the credit is yours because it is in your hand, you don’t even have to know how it works, the credit is all yours, with the slightest squeeze of your finger a hole appears in a piece of paper sixty feet away, and how can you not be impressed with yourself, how can you not love this coiled and sprung causation, I was awed, I was thrilled, the thing is guns come alive when you fire them, they move, I hadn’t realized that.” - Billy Bathgate From the novel by E.L. Doctorow

“The agency was beginning to recruit female personnel, and the women had even more trouble with the ten-millimeter. As an alternative, S&amp;W collaborated with the Winchester to design a new, shorter cartridge of the same bore diameter, which could be fired from a slightly altered version of the nine-millimeter pistol. To distinguish the new product, and give the FBI its own distinctive load, the manufacturers called the ammunition the .40 S&amp;W.”

    On how and why the .40 caliber was designed. Which by the way Glock beat S&amp;W to the market on a gun that shot .40. That’s right, Glock beat S&amp;W to the market on their own bullet!

“The purpose of the assault weapons ban was to reduce the number of these guns (and large magazines) on the street, Feldman noted, the bill had exactly the opposite effect.”

    On how the weapons ban of 94 only led to gun companies making more money and selling more guns and magazines.

“In Austria, the date of Glock’s birth is known to his employees and admirers as “Glockmas.” Celebrants mark the event with the presentation of ice sculptures and toast of praise. Champagne and wooden casks of wine accompany a spread of Wiener schnitzel, sausage wrapped in flaky pastry, and other traditional Austrian fan fare. And Glock thanks attendees in the style of a country baron blessing his peasants.”

    As the book continues you begin to see how the transformation that Gaston Glock went through (for good and bad). From an unassertive Austrian Engineer to a industry titan who very much loved himself.

“No brand of modern firearms commands greater loyalty than Glock. “Glockmeisters” see themselves as rugged, un-romantic, and above all, lethally effective – like the gun they love.”

“Glock, wrote Vis35 of Alaska, “is the AK-47 of handguns.”

    The author took this right off of glocktalk.com and mentions the website by name.

“I agree with most of what the NRA wants to do,” Jannuzzo later told me. “I disagree with how they try to do it, and I see through their agenda of constantly provoking political fights for fund-raising purposes. The NRA sees paranoia as good, because paranoia makes gun owners get out the checkbook.”

    I am an NRA member but I do agree with much of this statement.

“The firearms industry is a family,” said S&amp;W’s new president, Robert Scott. “We need to be a part of that family.” The NRA in turn, heaped honors on Scott, letting it be known that Smith &amp; Wesson was absolved of its sins. Gun shops began selling the company’s products again. The yearlong boycott ended.

    On S&amp;W renouncing the pact with the Clinton Administration that had caused a boycott on S&amp;W products. Americans felt as though the company had sold out to the govt.

“Apart from keeping a lot of lawyers busy, the campaign to restrict gun manufacturing and marketing via the courts had accomplished nothing.”

    Let’s hope we have the same outcome this year.

“After the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, US authorities outfitting local security forces turned primarily to the Glock. The American government bought more than 200,000 of the Austrian pistol for distribution to Afghan and Iraqi police, national guardsmen, and soldiers.”

    Many of these pistols are unaccounted for as there was no record keeping and many of the recipients sold them.

“Instead, this analysis assumes that guns are good and bad – like gasoline-powered cars that take people to work while degrading the environment and being involved in fatal accidents; like tasty steaks loaded with cholesterol and calories; like an Internet that purveys vial information, idiotic conspiracy theories, and vile child pornography. Barring repeal of the Second Amendment and a profound shift in the collective psyche of a large portion of our population-neither likely-guns are her to stay.”

“Gun control advocates deplore Glock’s marketing strategy. “The rise of handguns in dominance in the marketplace has corresponded with an increase in their efficiency as killing machines,” Sugarmann writes. “The human toll in death and suffering exacted by this process has been immense.” – This tough rhetoric appeals to many liberal citizens and scholars. But when drained of emotion and set against firearm realities and crime trends, it loses force.

“Sarah Palin got at least one important point right at the 2010 NRA convention: The total number of guns in private hands in the United States is at an all-time high, yet violent crime is back down to where it was in the early 1970’s, before most of the modern spike. Anti-gun groups, to their discredit, tend to paper over this good, if difficult-to-explain, news. It makes their fund raising and lobbying more challenging. Indeed, falling crime rates help explain why these advocates have failed to enact any meaningful new federal gun-control legislation since 1994.”

“Few of the Americans who as company employees helped make Glock what it is today have shared I its success or wealth”

    After reading this book, this is absolutely true and sad. Gaston Glock seemed to discriminate against Americans (and always treated them as second class citizens despite Americans making him as successful as he is). I love his gun, but don’t care for the man.

Do yourself a favor and read this book. It is about much more than just Glock. It covers the man, the company, the drama, the politics, the culture changes, and many things far and between.

I currently own a Gen4 19 that has a 3.5lb connector and a competition trigger spring(6lb).  I feel like this trigger is ok, but not anywhere close to the Apex DCAEK I had on my M&amp;P.  

The current setup is lighter than stock, but the feel is still gritty.  Looking over the mechanicals I feel that the grit comes from the safety plunger/spring setup.  I am ok with the trigger pull weight, but not the grit.  If I wanted to reduce the pull weight anymore, what else would I be looking at?  Lighter striker spring?

Has anyone on here ran a 'smooth' safety plunger with a 3.5lb connector and 6lb trigger spring? 

Has anyone moved from a similar setup to one of the full on trigger kits? (glockworx etc)


Thanks


EDIT: So far it seems like most people have a 3.5# connector and some sort of spring setup.  Doesn't seem like the money is worth a full trigger assembly compared to the connector and springs, I think I'll order two spring/connector kits and see how that goes.

**EDIT 2:**

My LGS had a zev/glockworks fulcrum kit instock for like 50% off so I picked it up.  Came with trigger bar, ejector housing, connector, trigger spring, 2 firing pin springs, and a safety plunger with spring.  

I installed the trigger bar, connector, safety plunger w/spring, and trigger spring into my gen4 (I kept my ejector housing).

I put my older 3.5# connector and trigger spring into my gen3 as well as a new larger slide stop.  

Thoughts: 
    
I installed the 3.5# connector and trigger spring into my gen3 first.  Then did all the zev parts into my gen4.  I've read that there are differences between the gen3 and gen4's when running a (-) connector and now have a direct comparison.  I don't have a trigger gauge but based on feel the **gen3 feels lighter with a (-) connector and trigger spring only vs a gen4 with the same (-)connector and trigger spring**  I've read that this is because of a slightly different angle in the gen4 ejector housing.  

Now with a direct gen3/gen4 exact parts swap done, I installed the zev stuff into my gen4.  That fulcrum trigger bar is really nice, I like it a lot, when set up correctly it is pretty much an on/off trigger, very little to no pre-travel depending on how you set it up.  Now since I had all the springs etc, I tried each one individually. 

**With the trigger bar/trigger spring and (-)connector it felt a little heavier than the gen3, but the trigger pull itself was nicer.  Like what some others have said adding the safety plunger w/spring didn't do much but made the pull weight feel about the same as the gen3, adding the competition firing pin spring brought the pull weight to a little lighter than the gen3 setup**

The two sets in question are the Tru-Glo Tritium night sights, and the Speed Sights ace of diamonds or whatever they actually call them http://www.speedsights.com/

I went to the link above only to see that the rear sights for the 9/40 caliber glocks are sold out, bummer. So I went to my original choice, the Tru-Glos, but I couldn't commit to buying them. 

What are they sights you guys use? What has worked best, what has been awful? This is my EDC weapon but it also pulls range duty, so I'd like my sights to have the versatility to be quick and easy to line up in a bad situation, as well as precise enough to take to the range and show up my buddy and his M&amp;P (jokes). Also what you could recommend is a tool to remove the front sight on this thing because i have no idea how it's supposed to come out.

They host larger outdoor matches however there was not one that was less than an hour away. The indoor matches are pretty simple to participate in yet it takes more than just turning money into noise to master.

One of the perks of GSSF is if you purchase 2 or more years of membership you get a (PDF)[Pistol Purchase Coupon](https://encrypted.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=gssf%20pistol%20purchase%20program&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CB0QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gssfonline.com%2FGSSF_Pistol_Purchase_Program_Information.pdf&amp;ei=PaaOUNa5H-f40gHj7oCQCQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNEmnaWB5vQbFT58g2kuZ7YnxRRtFg). This lets you purchase a brand new Glock pistol of your choice at Law Enforcement Prices (read: cheaper.) 

There are some very important catches to this coupon that I have experienced. YMMV:

 * Make sure the place you wish to use the coupon at accepts it.
 * The coupon appears to only apply to LEO/""Blue Box"" inventory. In the stores that I have visited they do not allow the coupon to be used against regular inventory
 * You only get one coupon per year
 * The coupons do have an expiration date, however it appears to be when your membership expires

If you join GSSF and get the coupon, call your LGS ahead of time to make sure they accept it AND they have the model and generation of said model available. This weekend I tried to acquire a Gen4 Glock 27 with the coupon and two big stores in my area either didn't have any Glock 27's or just Gen3 G27's.

My mom's neighborhood has been in decline for the last 5 years, and there have been a couple of break-ins in the last year.  She has expressed interest in a pistol. She's an average sized woman, and isn't going to carry it apart from maybe sometimes in the car.  

The question:

What ammo (and therefore caliber)?  I carry a G23 w/ Gold Dots, but am a decent shot, and have better situational awareness than she.  I'm specifically concerned with over-penetration, as I have a sister and two nieces that are in bedrooms opposite hers sometimes.  The internet says shot shells are no good on two legged beasts, but within the close range of her small home (1300sq ft/4bed/2bath), surely something acceptable can be found.  My fear is that she'd be too worried about her grand-babies too pull the trigger, and the whole situation goes to sh*t.  I want her to be confident that nothing lethal is going to make it through the wall.  If a suitable round can be found, I suppose a revolver in that caliber is what she needs.  Thoughts?

GLOCK was the first pistol I ever bought and it is my favorite.  I recently bought a G34 with the intention to try competition.  With that, I wanted to get more mags and have been completely out of luck.  I had some on order with Dawson Precision, but realized they are no longer shipping them.

I know the recent political climate has made things worse, but it seems worse for GLOCK mags.  

Any idea why this is (if my assumptions are true)?
Any one have any luck finding GLOCK factory mags online?

I noticed shooting yesterday when the slide on my 19 is locked back, if I insert a fully loaded magazine or even a magazine with one round, it will release the slide and chamber that round without me touching the slide or the slide release.

I tried it with two different types of FMJs and some Golden Sabres and got the same result.

FWIW, the RSO tried and could not replicate it.

I am relatively strong and I like to make sure my magazines are in there, but I doubt it's just my brute force causing the problem. I thought at first that I was rotating it slightly at the same time, but even without this action, it still released the slide.

My G19 has about 500 rounds through it. The only internal modification I've done is to put in a new connector, but I don't really know how that could be causing the problem.

I would provide a video, but I don't have any snap caps and don't really like chambering live rounds in the house.

TL;DR - Slide releases itself when I slam in a loaded magazine. What gives?

Without a doubt I was slightly overzealous with the lube, but it ran flawlessly. Didn't intend to overlube but was in a hurry and didn't pay close enough attention. Would that have caused this? Would it be wise to detail strip the slide to make sure this crap isn't in there?
