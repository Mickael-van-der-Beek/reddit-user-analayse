Last week, the bassist guy texted my wife and invited her to a concert in a city 100 miles away, on a weeknight.  She wanted to go, by herself, and I brought up the events of new years eve.  She stopped talking to me and gave me the silent treatment for three days.

I went on a business trip over the weekend and kept in touch with her every day.  When I got back we spent valentines day together.  Yesterday, I was on reddit and saw that I had an orangered.  I clicked on it, only to realize that my wife was still signed in on my computer.  She used her account for gonewild, which I knew about and supported, but what I didn't expect is that she was sending photos to guys via PM.  I continued reading.  One guy asked ""What's the wildest thing you've ever done?""  And there it was.  She responded with, ""On NYE I had my first threesome with a member of a famous 90s rock band and a friend...""  

The first thing I did was speak to a lawyer about my options.  Then I confronted her about it, and she said it was only half true.  She said she embellished and that her friend really is gay and she and the bassist made out and did oral.  That's when I left the apartment, and headed straight for the hospital to get tested for STDs.  

I got back several hours later, not believing a word she said.  I told her to text the guy simply ""did we have sex?"" and if he says no I'll believe her.  She then admitted they did have sex.

My whole life has been shattered.  We were married for less than a year, and I invested my whole being into this 5-year relationship.  I moved into the second bedroom and I'm sleeping on a futon.  Our lease goes until May.

I just wanted to update reddit, since I know people rarely do that, and thank you for being there for me before.  I'm in the south Jersey/Philly area and could use some love.

We've been married for two years.  I'm working three jobs right now -- initially I started working two jobs to save up some money so we can put a down payment on our house, but I noticed about two months in that she was spending the extra money that I had been making, mainly on clothes and shoes.  This month, I had a perfect storm -- in the span of thirty days, I've:

* been 'laid off' at one job, getting a nice severance and buyout package.
* started working two different jobs to replace the first job
* still maintaining the 'second' job that I took back last year to have extra money.

Between my severance, and my three jobs (and some expenses that I had at my last job finally being paid, I've had about $20,000 worth of income this month.

I went to buy gas tonight, and my debit card was declined.  I hop on my phone, and check my bank account, and right now, I'm $722.93 in the hole.  The last few transactions were:  $1250 for a Macy's account (something that I don't have access to nor do I use), $100 for hair, $70 for a mani/pedi, and $388.94 for her Dilliards card (same as the Macy's card).

I've tried discussing things with her;  specifically, i've tried to talk her into living on a budget, but, her response is something along the lines of, ""I'm not going to live like my aunt who had to beg for money from her husband.""  She has her own job, but doesn't contribute financially -- she cashes her paychecks and spends them at will.

Finally, I was traveling two weeks ago and turned 31.  While I got her a lot of nice gifts for her birthday (a new MBP to replace her ailing laptop and a Tiffany's charm bracelet), I didn't get anything for my birthday because, ""you were out with the boys having fun.""  

As I work more to try to save up money, I become more and more empty on the inside.  I just don't know what to do anymore, and I'm really confused on how I can deal with this in a positive way (or, hedge my bets in a way that I don't get taken to task in Divorce Court).

* If someone treats you badly or doesn't respect you, leave. 
* If you are pining for someone, you need to get up, do other things and meet new people. Just because you had a bad experience with ONE person does not mean it will happen again; do not carry baggage from the past forward even one more day. 
* There is no secret to life/love. Everyone is as clueless as everyone else in the beginning, its just that some people hide insecurity better than others. Improvement comes at the expense of hurt, that's the cost of entry to the relationship game.
* If your SO cheats on you then you have to either leave or genuinely forgive them. If you choose to stay, you have to dismiss it and not use it as a club for the rest of your time together. 
* Everyone fucks up. Allow for that in others and forgive it in yourself. 
* You can't choose who you fall for, or stop loving someone by act of will; it just takes time. Conversely, you can't make someone love you. 
* If they hit you, they don't love you no matter what they say. Leave. 
* If you need to take drugs or drink to be with someone leave. 
* If you do long distance long enough sooner or later one of you will cheat.
* Avoid jealousy. If someone is with you, it's because they want to be. If they leave, its because they don't. 
* Talk. Always let people know what you want, be it sexually, emotionally or even just what you want for dinner. Being in love doesn't make someone a mind reader. 
* Be sane and demand sanity from your partners. 90% of the issues on here stem from crazy. Yes, we know the crazy ones are best in bed, but eventually that doesn't matter. 
* Trust your intuition or gut feeling, if something seems wrong it probably is.
* It's not your partners 'job' to make you happy. No one is responsible for your happiness but you. 
* Don't over-consider the opinions of others. No one knows the truth of your relationship as well as you. 
* Beware, too, that many others have a personal agenda, which may not be in your best interests; the 'friend' who secretly wants to be with you, even the genuine friend who just misses you as a wingman, etc. 
* Don't let external influences ruin your relationship. It really is the two of you against all else. 
* If you decide to break up, do it. Don't be a jerk or asshole to them, hoping they will just crack and leave. You can never be mean enough to someone to make them leave, you just mess them up for later.
* Avoid being clingy. You don't have to be together all the time, maintain your own interests and don't neglect your friends.
* Once you have the girl/boy of your dreams do not become complacent, show them you love them every day and work at improving yourself in every way, so they can constantly fall in love with a better you.
* If you have a need to know something in your relationship, ask your partner! You can learn a lot about someone by talking to them.

1343892575.0,372,self.relationship_advice,xjxnb,[24/m] I just blew my chances with a girl because I was trying way too hard to make her like me. How do I meet a girl who would actually appreciate my advances?,StopDownVotingMe,585,213,1532,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/xjxnb/24m_i_just_blew_my_chances_with_a_girl_because_i/,"First of all, I know that the title makes me sound ridiculously bitter toward women, but I'm not here to say ""Girls suck because they don't like my advances!"" I want to know how to meet the kind of girl that would be receptive toward my particular brand of romance.

Here's what happened...

I met a girl on OkCupid. We met up and had coffee. It ended on a positive note. She even said she wanted to see me again.

Years ago, I made a girl lose interest in me because I was being way too persistent / clingy. I wanted to avoid making the mistake that I made in the past with this new girl. I decided to be really careful this time, and avoid smothering the girl in attention

Over the next three days, I texted her and posted on her Facebook, but I was sure to send very few messages so that I wouldn't look desperate / insecure. (One Facebook post per day, two texts per day. She always responded.)

I asked her if she had any plans for the weekend, and she didn't respond. However, I can see that she's online and active, so she's clearly decided to ignore me; I must have made a very bad impression with the few messages that I sent her over the past few days.

Looking back over my own messages, I can see that even though I only sent her a handful of messages, I was acting very ""Please like me back! Please like me back!"" in every message. I don't think I can change that; that's who I am. I'm lonely, and, admittedly, I'm actually quite desperate for someone to reciprocate my feelings.

My question is, where can I find a girl who is going to be okay with that? I'm the type of person who wants to send a dozen texts an hour to the girl I like. I'm the type of person who falls head-over-heels in love after one meeting. I've just proven that there's no point in trying to hide who I am, because girls can always tell.

It's not a matter of hiding how desperate / clingy / love-starved I am. It's a matter of finding a girl who doesn't care.

My question to you is...how exactly do I meet a girl who won't instantly disqualify me for being desperate?

**EDIT:** Wow...1500 comments. I just wanted to say thank-you to everyone who posted and offered their advice to me. I'm going to read every comment that's been posted, even though it'll take me a long time.

The universal consensus seems to be ""Your problem is that you have low self-esteem"" ""It's not ever acceptable to be clingy and obsessive"" and ""Never look for an emotionally unstable person"". 1500+ people all telling me the same things can't be wrong, so I'm pretty convinced that you guys are correct. I'll try my best to stop loathing myself, and I'll try to train myself to get so overly-attached to any girl that smiles at me. It's going to take a long time to change who I am, but I guess in the end it'll be for the best...",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1344015987.0,,,True,t3_xjxnb,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/xjxnb/24m_i_just_blew_my_chances_with_a_girl_because_i/,

I loved her so much and she meant the world to me. We were fully intent on marrying each other and made this fact very clear to each other. It was an integral part of our relationship. Things were going fabulously, so the breakup was completely unexpected and absolutely devastating for me. Well, it turns out that discovering herself involved discovering the intimate parts of a man she just met on a summer work program. This was a month ago.

Last week, my parents, who have been happily married for 24 years now separated for an indefinite amount of time. My dad moved completely across the country to live by himself in a little house full of low income students. Both my parents were completely crushed by the breakup as well because they really loved my girlfriend and were already talking about the grandkids they couldn't wait for. I have always valued the love and support my family has given me throughout my entire life, but neither of them are in any position to help me, and I honestly can't blame them for that.

On top of all that, my 2 best friends, people that I've known for my entire life, died in a car crash over the Independence Day weekend. They were the core of my support group, and have been with me every step of the way in my relationship and life, and now they are gone too. The pain and shock from that hasn't hit me yet.

Heartache and heartbroken don't even begin to describe what I'm feeling right now.

Reddit, what do I do? The world was a awesome and happy place just a month ago, and today I have been in and out of the Psychiatric Emergency Services of the ER for trying to kill myself. I have other friends to turn to, but understandably they have nothing to say.

I have reached the bottom of the abyss. Please help. If this is not the right place to post this, let me know where I should post this.

Edit: Every single comment is greatly appreciated and I am refreshing the page furiously. I can't reply much right now because my laptop ran out of batteries, so I'm stuck with crappy in flight internet on my phone. I will reply to everyone, thank you so much for the outpouring of support, I had no doubt in my mind that Reddit can come through for me even in a time like this.

Thank you all again for your responses. I noticed that a top post in relationship_advice said that the advice in this subreddit is black and while boilerplate stuff. This post has wholly disproved that for me, and it constantly amazes me that anonymous people on the internet can come together and be loving human beings together. We all have a little troll in us, but I'm so happy that we all have a lot of compassion in us too. Anyhow, onto responding. Thank you everyone, I love you all.

Every word of encouragement is uplifting, and to everyone who has offered their ears in this time of need for me, even if it is just to listen to me vent, I cannot thank you all enough.

Thoughts appreciated.,thrownaway743,460,136,703,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/mazxi/gf_pregnant_by_another_guy_after_wild_weekend_of/,"Me and my GF are both 30. We have good jobs and make a reasonable amount of money. We have been together for 5 years.

I love her very much. She is to be frank the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. She could easily be a model. She is many guys ideal woman and a certain 10/10. Whenever she goes out she gets hit on CONSTANTLY. Whether i'm there or not actually.

Me, not so much although I have no problem attracting women. I am above average (7/10) and take care of myself, but I couldn't be a male model or anything.

Generally our relationship has been fantastic. Neither of us has been unfaithful and we are very much in love. I certainly love her very very much.

The last six or so months have been stressful however. Work has been into overdrive for both of us, and although we've made a reasonable amount of money towards buying our first house either of us getting home before 10pm has been very rare. Basically we've been exhausted and have neglected both sex and our relationship, although not for any other reason than time and being exhausted. My feelings haven't altered one iota and neither have hers.

Fast forward to around 2.5 months ago when we were both invited to separate reunions with old friends across the country (neither of us are originally from the area we're living in now). It was a great opportunity for both of us to blow off steam after working so hard and neglecting life for a few months, although we were both disappointed it wasn't going to be with each other. 

So we kissed, told each other how much we loved and will miss each other, and I went across the country to my hotel and she went to hers.

Lets just say, we had VERY different weekends.

Hers involved going to a party where in her words, the most good looking guy she has ever seen approached her. Apparently he was a friend of a friend of someone else at the party. She basically said every woman was getting wet just looking at him and she was just on a high that this guy approached her. She didn't plan on anything, but everyone was drinking heavily and she ended up in bed with him....... FOR MOST OF THE WEEKEND.

When she came back she was the most loving attentive girlfriend you have ever seen. I was still too tired/exhausted for sex, but literally she was like a stepford wife in the weeks that followed. I stupidly just put it down to her missing me and loved that she loved me so much.

Fast forward again, she broke down and said she couldn't cope with the lie anymore and told me everything. Prompted I'm sure by her finding out that morning that she's pregnant. There is ZERO possibility of it being mine.

She is the most sorry and frightened woman you have ever seen. She even asked me to physically assault her because she is so angry and upset that she cheated on me. She will do ANYTHING I want to make things ok. It's a bit scary actually. She is frightened and literally shaking at the prospect of me leaving her.

If i'm honest with myself I think most of the fear is about the baby. She is crying saying she can't get rid of it and she is terrified of keeping it and raising it alone.

I was completely and utterly numb and heartbroken.

I said to her that before I go any further, I need the truth. Literally every second of what happened that weekend or I'm out the door. I knew this was a double edged sword and that the reality and cold facts could destroy me, but I'm one of these people who can't not know.

The facts were horrifying and made me physically sick. I actually threw up. Basically my girlfriend was this guys personal porn star for the weekend. Some highlights:-

* It was the roughest most aggressive sex she has ever experienced, and she fucking loved every minute of it. It was the best sex she has ever experienced.
* She had several powerful and intense orgasms during their weekend in bed. She has never ever cum like this before with anyone or solo.
* His dick was the best she has ever taken. 9"" (he made her fucking measure it during one of their sex games) which rubbed all the right areas and he could keep going for hours
* They didn't use protection (obviously) and he came in her mouth (she swallowed) all over her face, her tits and inside her several times during their weekend together. (How big were this guys balls?) Fun fact, after he came on her tits he pushed her back on the bed and scooped up his cum with his finger and FED it to her.
* He smacked her during sex (not too hard), her ass and her face and before she had time to even feel the pain or react he would whisper something or do something passionate that made her just let him ""keep going"" so she said. So he basically taught my girlfriend to enjoy some BDSM that weekend. Awesome.
* He caught some of the above on his camera phone. So there is a video somewhere of my girlfriend basically acting like a pornstar in a cheap hotel room.

So, Reddit. I can't say I didn't consider the implications of asking, but fucking hell I have had my heart firmly ripped from me.

Currently therefore I have a girlfriend who is pregnant by a male model BDSM hero with a magic cock, who is going to have his baby, and who is so sorry she will do whatever the fuck I want so that I can somehow get over this and stay with her. Basically I can treat her however I please as long as I don't leave. It's fine if I hate her for the rest of my life even as long as I stay with her.

We have been talking about marriage and kids this last year and she is desperate for me to commit to that still. She keeps promising to spend the rest of her life making this up to me and will be the perfect wife I could possibly want.

I don't even know what to think right now. I feel like every sense I have has been shorted out and I am now totally numb.

My first instinct is to just wait for her to work in the morning, then pack up all my stuff and just leave. I am not the type of guy to raise another guys baby. Especially now I know the full circumstances of how it was conceived. We have just 2 months left on our lease and I can easily switch to a different end of the country with my job very quickly. I feel so grateful for that right now.

So I can literally leave and never speak to or hear from her again.

The only problem is that I am so in love with her. I don't feel like I'll ever get over her. Fuck. I'm hesitating. I'm second guessing myself.

What do you think reddit? Is it possible to overcome a situation like this? I can't think how. I simply cannot raise this guys kid. I can't. Fuck.

My heads all over the place. Rational thoughts would be awesome about now.

1271414188.0,314,self.relationship_advice,brqux,An update on how things went with the 8 year old daughter I never knew I had.,NotReadyForThis,380,66,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/brqux/an_update_on_how_things_went_with_the_8_year_old/,"Hello again Reddit. I came here about 5 weeks ago to ask for advice regarding [my possible daughter](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9oed/i_desperately_need_help_please_help_me_do_the/).


5 Weeks is an Eternity. 

I got together with Frank and Janet (my exgirlfriend's parents and grandparents to an adorable 8 year old girl who I was told was the daughter I never knew I had). We all sat together for dinner where I was yet again introduced as a 'friend of Mommy's'. I didn't mind telling Cora (not her real name, but close enough) every little story and memory I had in my 2 years with Mommy during College. It was good for Cora to hear of these things, and even more important to me, Cora *knew* about some of these stories too. Mommy had told her about our more memorable roadtrips West and sleeping under the stars and our one trip overseas. Mommy even had some of the photos. Nothing's more surreal than seeing photos I've forgotten about and places I forgot I've been to. Later, when she went to sleep, I spoke with Frank and Janet about the need for a Paternity test. I was worried they would take this the wrong way, like I was trying to shirk off responsibility, or that I had doubts about my ex's intentions. But they were fine with this and so with their help, I arranged to have the test on a Tuesday morning. We also agreed it was a bad idea to tell Cora what the test was for, or who I thought I was until I knew for sure. 


It only took me a week to realise I couldn't work while I waited since I could not think straight. Lucky for me, my boss is a great man. I stayed behind one day after work and asked him to have a beer with me as I had something important to discuss with him. So we went to a nearby bar and I told him everything. By the time I was done, I was yet again crying (shit, even typing this reminds me of just how tightly wound I felt at the time and my eyes get puffy). He told me not to worry and that he'd take care of everything - I can take 2 months off right that day until I sort everything out. (Colin Ackehurst, if you ever read this you're a true gentleman and a friend, and I'm proud to work for you). 


So I found myself with plenty of time to plan my next steps. I spent a lot of time getting to know Cora, for starters. She is so damn smart. She likes to dance (though I question her taste in HipHop and modern Pop music, just like I did her Mother's so many years ago - she used to drive me *insane* with that.). She loves reading the Stacy Gregg series of pony books as well as the Babysitter's club series. She doesn't like sci-fi (real shame that) and she misses her Mommy even though she knows she's with God now and looking over her. Mommy never told her who her Dad is. She knows that Daddy didn't want to be with Mommy. That's all.


I couldn't understand why my ex would tell Cora about our trips together, but not tell her who I was. I arranged to meet with my ex's Sister to see if she could give me some answers or at least point me in the right direction. It did not go well. She was very hostile towards me. As the Godmother and aunt, she would make sure Cora was looked after and the only reason she hadn't already arranged for legal custody was Frank and Janet not allowing it. She made it very clear she did not want me there. I held my anger in check mainly because I made the mistake in meeting her at Frank and Janet's place. Outside, Cora was playing with her cousin and I had to remind myself of this as she told me I wouldn't never get custody as long as she lived. I told her as calmly as I could that I did not deserve her anger; I did not know about any of this until very recently. She was determined not to care or to listen. She said she'd sought legal advice already and that any court would rule in her favor. The rest of the afternoon was tense as I was determined **not** to go home like a dog with his tail between his legs. I was invited by Frank and Janet for lunch and lunch I will have. If anything, this made Auntie even angrier. That kinda made me feel a bit better. As soon as she left, Frank and Janet were all over me, apologising and telling me not to think too badly of her. They reminded me she had only just recently lost her younger sister, and that she was afraid I was coming to tear their family apart. It calmed me down a substancial bit to put myself in her shoes and to remember that I was the one that needed to reassure them, not the other way around. 


My next incursion was more succesful. Janet put me in contact with Angela - my ex's best friend. Again, I'm glad for Janet's introductions who made it possible to meet with people who would otherwise not want to do so. We met for morning coffee and we talked right through lunch and dinner and well into the night. In one day, I learnt more about my Ex than I had in 3 weeks of trying to find out. Angela didn't see eye-to-eye with Auntie either. Auntie didn't look eye-to-eye with anyone in fact. She didn't approve of Angela either, who she saw as an 'irresponsible influence' on her sister. I found out just how lonely and how determined my Ex had been all these years. Though they met later in life through work, she knew most of the history between my Ex and I. And I believer that she gave me the answer I've been after. I believe I understand now why my Ex did what she did and how she rationalised it as being the right reason all those years ago. Her decision locked her into a future she had not planned for and she did the best she could. I accept that Cora is the precious gem who she is because of her mother's nurturing and guidance. I still wish she had contacted me many years ago - who knows how things would have turned out? Something else I learnt: I now know that 2 years ago she *did* attempt to contact me. I haven't made a serious attempt at keeping my online privacy and a quick search was able to bring up my cellphone number. She tried calling me the day she found out about the Melanoma. My phone didn't answer and it went into voicemail. She didn't leave a message. She didn't try again, though she had my number and knew where to find me. Again, I can't begin to imagine what must have gone through her mind back then. 

---------------

I wrote that almost 3 weeks ago. At last, today, the results came in. 

While most of the results page consists of six-letter acronyms and numbers, the important info is right on top. 

*""the alleged father, XXXXX,* **cannot** *be excluded as the biological father of the child abcd...*

So, with a probability of 99.99 and some odd decimals, I can confirm that I am a father to a beautiful 8 year old girl who just lost her mother. 

She is **our** daughter. I'm a father and I have a lot of work to do.

---------------
 

Many weeks ago, I decided I needed help from my family. So when I arranged to met my younger sister and I told her of the events of the past few weeks, her first reaction was to give me a hug like only a Mother can. And when I went by her workplace to tell her the results today, she gave me another one. She's excited about being an Aunt once more. Next, I told Frank and Janet, who believed her daughter and were glad their faith was affirmed. 

Tonight, I'm going to tell the rest of my family. I've asked to meet me at my parent's home an hour from now. I don't know how that will turn out, but I believe it will be good. I'm relieved and nervous right now, which is why I'm writing this instead of getting ready. 


---------------

As for Cora? She figured things out weeks ago. (I told you she was smart). When she asked me if I was her Dad, I told her I thought I was. Things are good between us. That's enough. I want to thank you guys for your kind wishes and for letting me vent and put things into perspective back then. So thank you all and if it's not too much bother, wish me luck, will you? Thanks.

I am happy to say that this psycho bitch is no longer my girlfriend, and if things go as I want them to, no longer in my life at all. 

Things were going really well, everything just fine and dandy, for over a month after I read her my heartfelt letter. Yet again, however, your comments were swirling in the back of my mind and it wasn't enough for me that this girl I shared a home with was smiling, bubbly, happy, back to 'normal', whatever -- because she *never spoke about what she did*. I didn't bring it up myself because I thought she would come to me and maybe even **apologize** about it when she was ready, but nope, she just hummed around the house like some sort of innocent princess.

Well, recently she was cooking dinner and I was just sitting at the table staring at her, thinking about everything and feeling my blood boil. I didn't understand how she could act this way, how she could just do something so deranged and then cover it up. And I realized with the way things were going, she was *never* going to acknowledge her behavior or take responsibility for her actions. So I finally said something, but I hid my rage by speaking slowly and calmly: ""So what was that thing with you masturbating?""

I realized it was another pretend-she-didn't-hear-me moment for her as she just stood still for a while in silence, so I sighed and said something like ""We'll just talk about it whenever you're comfortable."" Apparently that set her off. She opened up the kitchen drawer to show me a photo of an actress that I apparently had complimented during a movie while screaming ""You find her attractive? You find her attractive?"" and pointing at her face. I started screaming over her ""so what if I find her attractive"" over and over until, yes, she got a knife. I immediately backed away in the sinking realization that she might actually be crazy enough to stab me, but she then pointed the knife at herself, or more specifically her vagina, and said she ""didn't even need it"" because I ""don't appreciate it"" and ""no one has genitals in the afterlife"". I didn't want to be around for it to escalate further so I booked out of there while she hurled insults at me. Right away I called her mom, since her parents live very closeby, but her mom didn't even let me finish explaining before she was screaming at me over the phone saying she ""knew what I did"" and that I was a ""Satan shitplane"" so I hung up and had to ignore her **literally 37** calls afterward.

Long story short, all of my contact with this girl from now on will be through writing if I can control it. I'm staying with a friend now while this stuff gets sorted. I'm not really sure what my next step will be, but you guys deserve a thank you for all of your advice as well as an apology from me for not seeing the light sooner. Hopefully this will be the last time I update or even think about this chick and her fucked up family. Bye.

**TLDR:** Girlfriend is now ex-girlfriend due to insanity, and her mom is just as bad.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1364241002.0,,,True,t3_1azn7n,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1azn7n/longawaited_update_about_this_psycho_b_who/,
1284088182.0,301,self.relationship_advice,dbwqo,Girlfriend saved some semen -- UPDATE,stolen_semen,384,83,325,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dbwqo/girlfriend_saved_some_semen_update/,"Okay, first, thanks to the suggestions about just asking her honestly and letting her explain herself.  Here's more or less what happened as best as I can remember what was said:


She called me in the afternoon and told me she'd be back around 7 or so and I was normal on the phone and told her that I'd come over after I was done at the gym (I put the condom back in the freezer in case she went to look -- I didn't want her to know I'd found it until I told her).  So I get to her place and she's in the kitchen putting away groceries and she says hey giving me the warmest smile and so I start getting a little nervous about bringing it up but I figure I need to do it now and not let it build up inside me anymore, but she starts talking about her visit.  So I walk up to her and put my hand on her should and she now can tell something is up because of whatever expression was on my face.  So I tell her, ""We need to talk.""


Her expression becomes very concerned and I just tell her I found the used condom in the freezer while looking for a leftover ice pop and her face turns bright red.  She bolts for the bathroom and locks the door and I'm now standing outside telling her I don't care about it and the only thing that matters is whether it's mine or some other guy's.  I can hear she's crying and I tell her that it's okay and she can talk to me and I love her and whatever it is we can talk about but she isn't saying anything, which is stressing me the fuck out.  


It takes her about 10 minutes until she agrees to come out.  She's still crying a little and I sit down on the couch with her, but she's still not saying anything though it seems like she wants to but doesn't know what to say.  In the calmest voice I ask her if it's one of mine and she doesn't respond and now my heart is sinking.  It's not.  She shakes her head and starts crying more and now I'm feeling dead inside.


I plead with her to explain it to me.  She begins telling me it's from her ex-boyfriend.  She says she saved the used condom because it made her feel better knowing she had it when her boyfriend dumped her (she's never really mentioned much about previous relationships and I never really prodded as she didn't seem to want to talk about them and I never really cared to know about guys that have slept with my girlfriend so we just didn't talk about it).


I'm thinking about this for a second and it's not seeming to make sense.  How did she get it *after* he dumped her?  I hate to start doubting her already but I have to know the full truth, right here, right now.


""What do you mean?  How did you get that from your boyfriend after he dumped you?  And why do you still have it?  I love you so much just tell me so we can get through this.""


I think saying this helped her get it out.  She tells me that when we started dating she was still not over her ex- completely and during the first few months we were seeing each other he was calling her up for sex, making her think they might still get back together.  As she's telling me this I'm thinking back to when we first started dating and it's making sense.  Sometimes she'd be into me and then other times she would go a few days without calling me back or answering my texts (which admittedly made her that much more desirable to me).


She says she was distressed and for some reason when he walked out after he got done one night ""fucking me"", she says, she saved the condom and cried herself to sleep.  Hearing this I'm now starting to get emotional and I put my arm around her and tell her it's okay, and that he's a piece of shit and he's out of her life now.  This is when she starts crying even more.  And I can feel this isn't everything and I have to ask.


""When was the last time you slept with him?""  


Six months ago.  It hurts.  I was in love with this girl six months ago and I thought she was with me.  I know six months together isn't that long of a time but still that's how it feels.  So I'm crushed.  At first I thought maybe those first few weeks we were just dating was it but apparently not.  She says it was the only time that recent and before that it had been only when we were first seeing each other.  I was out of town and he called her up and said he needed to see her, that he was a mess, etc etc., and that he brought over a box of wine (what a classy piece of shit, right?), they got drunk, and he seduced her.  After that she says she felt horrible and realized what an idiot she was and had been and that that was it and she told him never to speak to her again.


She said she'd forgotten the condom was there.  I asked her if she still had feelings for him and she said no but I worried she still has some strange attachment to this fuckwad.  She says she wanted to tell me but didn't know how, was worried I would leave her and thought it better not to hurt me.  I love her and I think she's telling the truth about everything.  We're all human, make mistakes.  We're getting through it and I think we're going to be just fine.


**edit**: Thanks for the support.  Those of you telling me to run away and get out, well if it doesn't work out I'll come back and tell you so you can tell me ""I told you so.""  As I said to a couple of you in replies, I deeply love this woman and am willing to work through it.  When you feel that kind of love, you don't just give up on it.  That's really something that's upset me about a lot of the suggestions in RA I've seen in the past.  So many of you are always so quick to tell others to just give up, break up, and move on without really knowing how this person feels about their significant other.  I'd like to think people who believe they're in love would be willing to work at it and not just throw in the towel.  There's no such thing as an easy ride.  


Anyway, I have to get some sleep.  Thanks again for all the support.  I'll check again tomorrow to see if there's anything else I can do to feed everyone's curiosity.

I'm sick to death of reading posts here and on r/TwoXChromosomes from girlfriends who are complaining that their boyfriends don't tell them ""I love you"" enough, or that the boyfriends forget their birthdays and anniversaries, etc.*

*I get it, some guys are bad at verbal expression (""women say, men do"") and bad at remembering dates.  But what these posts are really about is that the women are not feeling loved and attended to.  As a wise Redditor once said, relationships can fail because sometimes, to a man, a relationship is like furniture - you buy it once and you use it and never think about it again.  Whereas, to a woman, sometimes, a relationship is like a living thing that needs to be tended or else it is being neglected.*

*What I think is going on with the women who are writing those posts is that these women feel the relationship is being neglected and thus she starts to thirst for signs of affection: ""I love yous,"" gifts, remembering special days, etc.   But if she wasn't feeling dissatisfied in the first place, she wouldn't fixate on these petty things.*

*Men, do something for your women almost every day, and you will have a happy undemanding girlfriend on your hands. Do something small, so small it may only take between 5 seconds and 10 minutes, but it will make a world of difference.*

Here are some ideas to get started:


(1) Like her Facebook status.     
(2) Send her a kiss-text ( :* )    
(3) Once in a while, for no reason, look into her eyes, smile, and kiss her   
(4) Make-out wildly without it leading to sex    
(5) Leave her a note that she'll find later that says ""Hello, there, sweetness.""    
(6) When she comes home from the gym and gets in the shower, ask to come in with her and rub her shoulders under the hot spray, then jump out after ten minutes and let her finish and you can go about the rest of your business.    
(7) Buy her a roll of Lifesavers    
(8) Once in a while plan a date, even if it's just ice cream and movie at home.    
(9) If you see something she might like and it is less than $10, buy it (if you are gainfully employed).    
(10) Go to a restaurant that serves a kind of food she loves, but you don't, find the thing on the menu you don't mind eating (there is always one).     
(11) Bring her her morning coffee in bed.    
(12) Ask her what a dream vacation would be to go on together.     
(13) Tell her how much you like a special part of her body, like her cute knees or dainty fingers.    
(14) Take a picture of her with your phone when she is doing nothing special.    
(15) When she goes out with her friends without you, tell her you missed her.

Thank you very much for the plentiful and very considerate advice. I met with Lee today and hammered away some details, a lot what I said to him came straight from things suggested by redditors. He was fantastic, very understanding of my hesitancy and willing to take whatever steps necessary to make this work. 

I officially declined his marriage offer and asked that he not propose again in the next year. We are officially in a committed relationship. He has agreed to the following:

* No more gifts, unless it's an occasion or holiday. (Flowers are ok, with reason)

* He's getting his teeth fixed (he's such a dork sometimes, he didn't know about cosmetic dentistry! He thought repair would be lengthy and painful)

* Start eating healthier and exercising, which he had already done, guessing I would prefer he were a little more trim. 

* Better respect my boundaries, when I say no or slow down it needs to be heard. 

And here's what I agreed to:

* I'm applying for a job in another department, better hours, less stress. I will allow him to use his influence to help me get a position if I can't do it on my own. This allows me more free time for my son and for Lee.

* I will help Lee in his quest for fitness, heck, I could tone up a bit myself. 

* I'm giving this relationship the attention and consideration it deserves. I'm not just viewing him as an old man trying to buy my love, but as a man that cares about me and wants good things for me. 

I was panicked last night but feel really good about everything now. Thanks, again, reddit.

I stopped taking the pill 3 months ago after I started noticing side effects like weight gain. I didn't tell my boyfriend, since i didn't want to stress him out. I didn't think it would be a big deal, as most of the time he pulls out during sex. 2 days ago i found out im 5 weeks pregnant... it came as a pretty big shock as this is totally unplanned. I don't agree with getting an abortion (my BF has known about my stance on abortion since the beginning of our relationship) - so I know ill be keeping it. When i told my BF, he immediately asked if i was getting an abortion - WTF! I felt hurt and betrayed that he would even suggest this as I have made my feelings on the matter clear. He went on to say he didn't feel ready to be a dad, and that he wants to travel and start working before starting a family. We've had conversations on marriage and children before, and he said he wants that with me. I can understand if he's in shock and worried about finishing uni and stuff, but he knows my parents will support us and I am in the exact same boat here. I had plans too! I'm so upset and angry with him right now that he's being so selfish. I love this boy and want to marry him - how do i make him grow up and accept his responsibilitities?

EDIT: A lot of people are suggesting i purposely impregnated myself to lock my BF into marriage which is not true. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. You all think you can judge me, but you don't know the first thing about me or my life.

I didn't kiss a girl until I was 21 and I have never been in a real relationship.  Prospects are low.  I'm tired of crushing on girls and being too scared to say anything.  What the hell do I do?  I feel hopeless.

I promised to post a follow-up, so here I am. After some days of thinking what my life would be like without her presence, wondering if I could imagine myself being in a relationship with her, if I could see past her being a friend, and toying with the idea of a relationship, I decided to give it a shot. I was honest and told her my feelings weren't as strong as hers, but that I wanted to give it a try. As per some advice, I took her out on a date (just dinner and a walk in the city), held her hand and basically stopped acting like a friend. It was kind of weird in the beginning, but we quickly laughed it off. I kissed her good night which led to more kissing, but we stopped there. I actually had a really good time.

Since then, we've been doing more couple-y things, spent Christmas together, and basically been getting closer (if that's possible). We both agreed that being open and honest was the way to go. I have to say I'm actually very happy in a relationship in a long time (no bullshit, no drama, no pretending), and feel like this is going somewhere. And yes, we had sex and it was awesome. She's actually resting in my bed as I type this.

I met her at a gas station literally the same day I broke things off with my last girlfriend (at reddits advice).  Things have been going really good between us so far- especially with our sex life.  She's an honest-to-god nymphomaniac and we can't get enough of each other.  

The other day, however, after an amazing day of waterparks and fucking in my van, she told me that she had a huge epiphany to have a child.  This caught me off guard, as she seemed too mature to make a decision like this so hastily.  I don't think she'd be able to support the kid very well, she's a college student who can barely afford her loft.  She doesn't want to have it with a guy either, because as she put it every guy she's dated in the past has been an asshole and she doesn't trust the father not to walk out on her and the child.

This is really frustrating to me, we've been getting along so well up to this point and I feel like she's just throwing the relationship away with this decision.  I asked her if she wanted to wait and see how our relationship worked out before making the decision to have another mans baby but she's pretty focused on doing this soon.  Do you think I have the right to be bothered by this?  Am I overreacting?

 I even had the passing thought of ""donating"" my sperm to her, but I realize that would be incredibly immature and I am *not* ready to have a kid with someone.

**EDIT:  Thanks for the huge response everyone, I've read through every comment and appreciate the advice.  I had a talk with the girl a few hours ago and convinced her to put off the idea of a baby until she at least finishes school at the end of the semester.  Then, depending on how our relationship goes, I agreed to consider the idea of having the baby with her.  I realize some of reddit thinks this is a bad idea, but I convinced her that it would be much better for the child to have a loving mother and father and how difficult it is for a single mother to raise a child on her own.

1264003731.0,239,self.relationship_advice,aryuc,Today my inner man raptor awoke - I asked her out,enriched_humanium,278,39,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aryuc/today_my_inner_man_raptor_awoke_i_asked_her_out/,"This is a follow up to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aqs88/im_trying_to_ask_her_out_but_i_just_cant_do_it_i/)

I know reddit isn't supposed to be a personal blog or diary, but I feel it's appropriate to share this with RA. 

So today was the day I picked to ask her out. I'd been off work for the past few days and had made up my mind that when I got off (I work nights, her shift starts when I leave usually) I would finally ""sack up"" and go for something that I wanted - for once.

Since I had a few days since my first post I really tried to not dwell on it too much. I've been plenty guilty of building things up too much, and in reality I was *just* (doesn't feel like ""just"" to me but that is what it is) asking for a date - it's not a marriage proposal; people go on dates all the time so I really just wanted to keep things in perspective. 

I was nervous when I got up this morning though and that had me a little concerned. I mean, it was kinda like D-Day but instead of Nazis in concrete bunkers with machine guns, I was up against a much more formidable foe - my own fear. 

What I did though was just do everything like normal. I drove to work, clocked in, did my job and listened to my favorite podcasts on my iPod which oddly enough was the latest episode of This American Life 'Somewhere Out There"" which is all about meeting that perfect someone. To be honest, I wasn't really sure if this was going to take my mind off of things or not given the subject matter, but it worked.

So after working like normal, the building manager turns the lights on to get ready for the days customers and by then I knew she was already there. Still though, I carried on like normal. I clocked out, grabbed my stuff from the break room fridge and set off across the store to find her. 

Since I hadn't seen her in a few days, I was actually more excited just to say hello and all that than I was nervous. In fact any major nerves I had really were gone because when I rounded the corner and she was standing there I just felt it. You know - it. I **had** to ask  her out. I like her, she's beautiful and this is what I want.

But still, I didn't just blurt it out. We talked for a while, I told her about my days off, she told me about what she had been up to and she also mentioned she had no plans this weekend.

So I asked her.

I probably could have been a bit smoother, but I was direct. I told her ""I really want to take you out on a date this weekend. How about a movie and maybe dinner?""

I'm sure if my inner man raptor was more developed, I would have worded it better, but I was confident and I was looking right at her. 

Now the few times I've ever sacked up and been forward with a woman, I've often got some weird in-between answer. Usually something non committal. This is what I really was dreading because I don't know how to deal with those sorts of situations. A flat out yes or no is one thing, it's those ""well, you see, I'd like to, but ..."" sort of answers that I'm just not ""raptory"" enough to field. 

But I didn't have to worry.

In fact, **as** I was asking her, she lit up. I mean her whole face - hell, her whole body seemed to light up. I don't think she could have said ""Yes"" any faster. 

Then she just right out gave me her number.

It felt **damn** good. Really damn good.

So if anyone is still reading this who had replied to my first post - thank you. This really helped me get some perspective.

Now I know I'm just going on a date, but this is a big step for me. Though, really, I'm just looking forward to getting to spend a fun time with someone who I like.

I'll let you all know how it goes.

Thanks again.

When I posted this I was really mainly just following up on my last post. It seemed like a good idea to let RA know how I did with the advice from my initial posting.

1291495534.0,233,self.relationship_advice,eg917,"Hey, Forever Alone guys, here's some advice from a she-geek. ",satiredun,341,108,213,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eg917/hey_forever_alone_guys_heres_some_advice_from_a/,"Totally unsolicited. You may or may not agree. However, I know a few of you in person, and I'm an observant person, so here goes:

First and foremost, DON'T BE A TROLL. Seems simple and obvious, don't it? If you're chatting with a girl, don't try to goad her with how much you know or how much she doesn't. Don't revert to sixth grad 'I hit you I like you' type behavior. 

Second: Never, ever talk about being 'forever alone' with girls- whether you're attracted to them or not. It's fine to chat with friends about wanting to find someone, that you're lonely, etc. Where guys get into trouble is actually being self-deprecating. It's not a good attitude to have, and even if you aren't attracted to the girl you're talking like this to, remember this: girls know other girls. A lot of times, girls *like* to hook up single friends together. And I know from experience- mine and others- that we don't want to hook a girlfriend up with someone bearing that attitude. 

Third: have a sense of humor about dating. If you don't, you'll self destruct in no time. If you fail, and fail hard- take a step back and realize how idiotic and silly dating is. Everyone fails. If someone does something idiotic, mean, or rude- like ditch you- try your best to laugh about it, realize they're a bitch/cunt/not worth your time, and move on. which leads me to..

Fourth: Approach a date with the expectation to have fun, not to fall in love. If you've managed to score a date with someone who intrigues you- mentally, physically, or -gasp!- both- head out looking forward to getting to know them. It's sexy when a guy is having a good time, and it's obvious when they're expecting something later on. 

Fifth: to meet girls you'll like, try meeting them in places YOU like. If you're a huge dork, go to lectures or other events (dorkbot, tech parties, etc). Conventions or lectures or other 'extracurricular' activities are great places to meet girls who are into the same general things you are. Start up a conversation. Be casual. I've always been much more receptive to random conversations during these daytime or casual get-togethers than bars, clubs, or fancier parties.

and here's one more thing about first dates: Movies are shitty first dates. Don't get to fancy, either. A walk, bike ride, or other mostly-unstructured activity where you can chat is a great idea. Why unstructured? If there's no spark, you don't have to suffer through the rest of the dinner/day/activity. You can just laugh it off, realize there's no connection, and go home. 

That's about it. I'm happy to give more advice (hah) if you ask for it. For some info: I'm a 26 year old super geeky lady. I started a soft-circuit company, teach electronics, and am learning programming. I am also a cartoonist and a trekkie. 

TL;DR:

1. don't act like a troll

2. forever alone attitude is unsexy

3. laugh it off

4. expectations get you in trouble

5. if you don't like clubs, don't meet girls there.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_eg917,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eg917/hey_forever_alone_guys_heres_some_advice_from_a/,

I need your advice.  Last night, my fiance and I were out at a bar drinking with a group of people.  As the night progressed, everyone began getting a bit more tipsy.  At roughly midnight, I am talking to a girl next to me and I look over to see my fiance kissing another guy.  I was ready to beat some ass at that point but it came to light that she initiated the kiss.  I called her out and we drove home at that point, arguing with each other the entire time.  As we pulled into the driveway, she sprinted into the house unexpectedly.  I got worried at that point but did not immediately pursue.  i decided to go in the house about two minutes later and found my fiance holding our gun, trying to put a bullet in chamber.  I walked decisively toward her and disarmed her before she could use the weapon.  I wasn't sure if she wanted to use it on me or herself; but regardless, it was completely unacceptable for her to act in that manner.  At this point, I ran upstairs and locked the weapon in the room.  She ran after me up the stairs trying to get the gun from the locked room.  She discovered that the gun was not accessible and then proceeded to try to jump down the stairs to kill herself.  I restrained her from jumping but she bit me on the arm and elbowed me in the nose.  After, she grabbed my phone, ran out back, and hurled the phone at the neighbors house, breaking the phone.  I tried to restrain her again but she ran back inside and locked the door.  At this point, she ran around the neighborhood for about 20 minutes; I'm guessing she was knocking on neighbors doors.  I called the cops at this point and she is currently restrained in a mental hospital on suicide watch.

Now for the advice part.  We have been together for three years and are ready to be married in August.  There's no way we're getting married at this point and I am dead set on booting her from the house immediately.  Reddit, please help.  I desperately need some guidance on this situation.  

TLDR: Fiance freaked, pulled a gun on me, and is now in a mental hospital on suicide watch.  Do I leave her?

UPDATE: Went and visited her in the hospital and told her that it's over between us.  the next step will be breaking apart the life we created.  Step after that will be gym, save money, travel, and put my life on a new path.  Silver linings. 

UPDATE 2: Her mom and brother will be here Wednesday to help her pack her things.  I'll be out of town during that time to make the transition easier.  I trust her family and know they will pack only what belongs to her.  I'll seek some therapy myself to get over this.  Thanks for the advice Reddit.  You really did help steer me on the right path. 

UPDATE 3: Some new information came to light and I feel like it is very important.  Apparently this guy kissed her and not the other way around.  I trust this and believe her in the story as she pulled away from the guy about two seconds after the kiss was initiated.  In addition, the guy that kissed her was a fat loser looking dude who she told that she was engaged. She has always done this when someone has tried to cross the line. The guy crossed the line by kissing her and not the other way around.  In response to this, I blamed her for the kiss and would not let her tell her side of the story.  I was irrational and angry that night and pushed her over the edge by threatening to end the relationship due to a kiss that she did not initiate. I remember as a child when I would get blamed and punished for something I did not do and the levels of frustration that I experienced during those times.  The only way for her to get my attention may have been to pull a gun. 
She has committed to entirely stop drinking regardless of whether or not we stay together and is committed to getting therapy for this incident.  I am still leaning toward ending the relationship but will give her the opportunity to say her peace and at least have a rational discussion.  If she had initiated the kiss, I'd be gone and not looking back; however, with him initiating the kiss, it puts me at fault for not defending her honor and browbeating her for something she did not do.  During the ride home, I told her it was over and that she's out tomorrow.  I crossed the line and pushed her over the edge.  That was no excuse for pulling a gun and that in itself is most likely the deal breaker.  But there are two sides to every story and we owe it to each other to end or mend our relationship like adults.  I'll follow up with the conclusion on Thursday.

This was an online relationship that's lasted 15 years.  Also my dad is doing much better today.  Cancer is not worse, had a stroke, which is good news for us.  

My wife and I (married almost 5 years) hit a rough patch.  She admitted to me that she checked my email and saw an email from my ex-wife saying she (my ex) still loved me.  I got curious and looked for that email.  It was dated 2004, a couple years before we (present wife) met, right after our divorce was finalized.  I deleted it, and pondered why I even kept it or if my wife even bothered to read it or look at the date.

So I got a hair up my but and decided to check my wife's email.  I've had no reason not to trust her...I just felt violated and decided my method to take care of the situation was to do what she did to me.  Except, I don't know her password for her email, but her facebook opens right up.  So I just opened up facebook and then clicked on a couple of her friends to see their correspondence.  Boring, boring, boring.  Almost decide to just stop and see a message from one of her friends (a female friend) she doesn't really see anymore.  I open that up and scroll through and right before they stopped talking and see just dozens of messages about how my wife is trying to plan on a vacation with her 'soul-mate'.  

The time on the messages was late last year.  I keep scrolling and learn that she has a soul-mate (SM) and it is not me.  He lives in another state.  She's talking about how she's and the SM are willing to drive half way to hook up.  She also talks about leaving me and how she hates to leave me, but she wants to be with him and if he asked, she would leave me in a heart beat.  SM has a current girlfriend and my wife said something along the lines of ""I can't wait until that bitch is out of the picture, just have to figure out how I'm going to give hubby the news"".  

I am absolutely floored by this discovery.  Now I must believe there is this ticking time bomb on our relationship.  I feel absolutely horrible that I even saw all this, and maybe she was just talking things up with her friend.  Or maybe not.  

I sent my wife a text saying ""I wish I was your soul mate"".  I have not confronted her yet and she has no idea what I saw.  She replied with ""You may not be my soul mate, but you're my best friend.""  What in the actual fuck is that.  

This is done, right?  

**tl;dr**: saw messages from my wife to one of her friends talking about how she wants to leave me for another man.  Considers me her best friend and not a soul mate.  This is my exit, eh?

**[UPDATE 5/3]:** Sorry about no updates.  I still have not talked to her about this.  I'm not trying to avoid the situation, my father has been battling cancer for about 8 years now.  He had to go to the ER yesterday, my blood family needs me now.  Told wife that and I didn't want to be bothered with worry about how she wants to ""fix"" things.  

She sent me this email last night...

*The thought of losing you makes me hurt. Really bad. I am sorry you are hurting from me and from whats going on with your dad. I want you to be there for your family, but I want to be there for you. When we got married I meant it when we said in good times and in bad. I know I already said this to you, but I hate that you are hurting, I'm sorry that things I said hurt you. I love you with all my heart and I will do anything to keep our family together. I can't change the past, but I will do my best to make it right. I love you so much. I'm sorry that saying you were my best friend made you mad, but you are my best friend, my lover, my partner, and I believe that. I want us to be together forever like I said I love you forever. please come home. please come back to me.*

Last Monday I took my GF on a trip to the western part of the state, for work. She knew it would be boring, she knew we were low on cash (unsure why, and didn't ask, thankfully). I just kept telling her I was saving money.. finally I broke down and told her I bought her a video game (which made her ecstatic!) but told her she wouldn't get it til we get back, it's being shipped to my work and I can pick it up when we get back. 

She was satisfied with that reasoning.

So, come Monday, 4 hour drive, 4 hours at work, then it's time to shower, change, and go to dinner. I take her out of town into the mountains, by this Lake in the mountains that has a beautiful view and restaurant .. the place was closed... So, we walked down to the lake, beautiful water, it was 72 degrees outside, perfect..

I turned to her and the following ensued:

Me: ""How much do you love me?""
Her: ""More than anything...""
Me: ""I love you more than that.. and more than anything in this world, you've done so much for me, and helped me grow, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you, so I have a question for you..""
Her: (weird loook on face)"" What's that?""
Me: (Gets down on One knee and pulls ring out..) ""Will you marry me?""
Her: (In disbelief, tears rolling down her face, lip quivering) ""OMG Yes! I love you so much! (Gut wrenching hug received). 
As we walked back to the car, I mentioned ""Babe? That was your video game. I love you"" and she laughed and kissed me.

We went and ate a FABULOUS dinner at another restaurant and each entree was nearly 30$ so I felt fancy. 

We went back to the motel, and got ready for bed, and cuddled until we fell asleep in each others arms.. .

I'm happy RA.. more than I've ever been.. she's perfect for me.. we love each other dearly.. and not to mention, she's carrying my Son.. due in Dec. I'm absolutely excited! Things have finally turned up for me, from a bad relationship past.

For all of you out there, it's possible, it can happen, keep pressing on and keep your head up!

Thanks for reading.

1300281337.0,224,self.relationship_advice,g547s,Why do so many people in the West leave long term relationships for no real reason besides boredom?,pokpokpokpok,291,67,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g547s/why_do_so_many_people_in_the_west_leave_long_term/,"Okay. I'm not trying to be racist or stir the pot, it is an honest question and observation. 
I've seen so many posts on here about people who leave long term relationships, sometimes after 20, 30 years, because they 'don't know who they are anymore' and 'want to see what single life is like'. Now, from what i see, most of the time people are trying to get into a relationship to escape single life, but when they get it, they seem to lose interest extremely quickly. I come from an Asian background and no on in my family has ever gotten a divorce, nor would any of them ever leave a marriage or relationship that has lasted a decade in order to 'find themselves'. Even in Indian and Arabic cultures, people get married to people they hardly know in arranged marriages and most of them are happy as ever and extremely fulfilled. What is it about Westerners that drive them to feel so disenchanted with everything that they would leave their family and relationships after years of being together, to be alone?
I've also noticed my Asian friends tend to remain in 1 or 2 serious relationships their entire young adulthood and then get married in their early 20's. However, my Caucasian American friends will date multiple people, sometimes being together for 3 years and even living together, to decide to end it in order to 'explore themselves' and 'have fun'. 

And what i find most baffling about all of this is that, despite the youth dating for so long, the country with the highest divorce rate is America! However, countries where arranged marriage is rife and dating is pretty limited, the marriages seem to last much much longer (for example, Sri Lanka.) Funnily enough even countries where dating and pre marital sex is common, like Italy, also have astoundingly low divorce rates. 

As i said before, i am asking this out of interest and not meaning to offend anyone. I'm just curious as to how this phenomenon came to be and why it is how it is.

1334890342.0,207,self.relationship_advice,sizey,I have an offer of marrying a very wealthy man who knows I don't love him. ,possibleconcubine,265,58,267,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/sizey/i_have_an_offer_of_marrying_a_very_wealthy_man/,"I am 26-year-old single mother with a 10-year-old son. Yep, do that math, I was a teen mom before it was on MTV. I just focused on him until about 5 years ago and since then I have had nothing but bad luck with men. Seriously, I have pheromones that only attract losers, users, and liars. Maybe I have bad taste, they all seem like nice men. Even the ones picked out by others end badly.

I have struggled financially. I have done my best to provide well for my son, went to school to be a RN (Registered Nurse) and make $45,000/year (Working close to 60 hrs/week). We own a modest home and he doesn't want for much. I drive a '97 Camry and it's on death's door. I have shin splints and foot problems from long shifts on my feet. I try really hard to be good with money and have managed to put a whopping $13K in my son's college account. 

I met this man, let's call him Lee, at a Hospital Board meeting. I am the  RN rep for my dept, he's on the Charity Board of Directors. He comes from family money and has invested well. When he asked me out the first time I politely declined. He's 45, over-weight, and not my type. He was very persistent and I agreed to lunch. At lunch he gave me an iPod, he had asked other nurses on the floor and he found out mine was recently stolen. I tried to refuse it, but he wouldn't accept it. 

I felt obligated to him after that and didn't like it. When I attempted to return it, he again refused and talked me into having dinner with him. At dinner he slipped an envelope in my purse, a gift certificate to a really nice day spa, with a sweet note about deserving to be pampered. 

At this point he won me over. No man has ever been so thoughtful or kind to me. I went out with him again but made him promise to let me treat him. We had a nice time, but...no spark, no passion. I tried kissing him, it was like kissing my uncle. That night there were flowers delivered to my door with this note ""Please keep trying. I think we could be something special. I'm falling for you."". I felt terrible. I felt like I was leading him on. I planned on seeing him the next day to end it. 

But I didn't. I thought about all the losers and the men that never called after they had finally gotten me in bed. I realized this was the first time I had EVER gotten flowers. Even when my son was born... I took his advise and kept trying. We went out for a few more weeks and it was clear that he was in love with me. The gifts were still coming and he started talking about 'our future'. I decided to see if we were sexually compatible. It was pretty good, he was...generous, as always. The next day I came home to a brand new Toyota Camry in my driveway. Another note ""Don't even try to refuse this. You deserve this. And so much more. 

I felt like a whore. I was insulted and angry. I drove it to his house and left it there with my own note ""It's over. Leave me alone and don't even think about bringing this back"". Maybe I over-reacted. I don't know.

He called me and asked to see me one more time, to explain himself. I agreed, wanting the opportunity to return the gifts. He was calmer than I expected. He proposed it like a business venture. He loves me and doesn't care if I love him. If I agree to marry him he will take care of me in every way possible. My son will go to the best private school, and have higher education provided. I can quit or work less hours, or go back to school or sit at the pool all day. Basically, free to do as I please. He travels often and I would get to see the world. He has a vacation homes in Kona and Italy. No pre-nup either. He said that he'd expect me to be faithful, but would do everything in his power to keep me satisfied. Also, no matter what my choice; the car is mine. 

That was yesterday. There's no deadline on my decision but would like to give him a firm answer by the weekend. He wants to fly me to his parents' house on the coast to announce the engagement. The car was returned to my driveway while I am writing this. I will never be able to provide for my son like this. He'd be a good step-dad, and my son has no father in his life. 

I really don't think he wants a shiny new toy, he can certainly afford newer and prettier. He's a lovely man that loves me. There's a big part of me that is attracted to how much he cares. I am also attracted to his kind heart and determination. I feel like I will regret not doing this. 

On the negative side: I worry I will always feel beholden to him. I worry that I will feel like a prostitute. I worry that my son will sense that this is a union of convience and it will hinder his mental growth toward healthy relationships. I worry that I will never grow to love him and be resentful toward our marriage. I also have a very small worry that his family will see me for what I am and treat me poorly. I worry that I'm cheating him out of the possibility of being with someone that really loves him. I worry that I won't respect myself after. 

So reddit, what would you do?

So, I'm going to make a few suggestions as one of your ""friendly"" moderators. ***I'm speaking only for myself here.***

**Concerning ""hetero-normative"" and ""polyphobic"" comments**

r/relationship_advice is supposed to be for *everybody*. Not just heterosexual people in monogamous relationships. Giving people shit for being gay or being in non-monogamous relationships can be funny if done well, but isn't really constructive here.

LGBT and polyamorous submitters may want to consider cross-posting to [r/lgbt](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt) and [r/polyamory](http://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory) as well as this subreddit.

**Concerning sexist comments.**

I've also seen complaints concerning comments about man cards and women being whores. To suggest that ""all women are whores"" is, quite frankly, an insult to whores. Save the misogynist comments for r/mens_rights, and the misandrist comments for r/2Xc or r/feminisms.

Women should not have to put up with slut-shaming here. Men should not have to put up with having their masculinity questioned because they don't conform to gender expectations.

**EDIT[0]:** *changed the suggested place for misandrist comments to r/feminisms so that impotent_rage could find something else to complain about.*

She found this new group of guy friends 3weeks ago and now wants to hang out with them almost every night from 8pm-3am. Suddenly a few days ago she tells me she has a crush on this one guy and that she can't promise she won't cheat on me. Now she wants us to just be roommates and be ""free"" and ""happy"" and ""go with the Flow"" I asked her to be specific. frustrated with me she says that she wants to enjoy the gushy feeling with this guy and wants me to go do the same. I am perfectly happy being with her alone. She says im being selfish and should consider how she feels.  Before 3weeks ago we were a happy family with all the love in the world. I mentioned counseling, she said she was ok with that but is still hanging out with these guys.  I can understand how she might be bored and im willing to goto any length to respark our relationship.(movies, parks, outings etc) we are Best friends and have never had this problem before.

EDIT: i told her im staying with family for a week. With our son. after that we can decide what we really want out of this relationship. She tried arguing, painting me a bad guy, playing the victim, playing innocent etc but i continued to reinforce my standpoint saying we both need this break. She agreed, but she still cant promise she wont cheat on my while we are gone. I feel jaded, if i come back and this has happened then i am done. Thank you all for such sound advice, it kept my level head and helped me see through trapping manipulation.

Update: she deleted this guys # and is getting off this medication call busperone. Anyone have an experience with this?shes been taking it since this started. She says this is why she was acting strange and she feels normal now. I took her and my son to the zoo and we have had a great family day. Idk how i feel, im confused.

Final edit: so after a counceling session, we figured out that she is confused about what she wants for her present and future while i know exactly who i am and what i want in life. Im a loyal one woman kinda guy. The therapist said if she decides she wants an open relationship and i dont then its a deal breaker. I have been feeling depression, heartache, despair and sadness since then but it gets weaker everyday. Im a strong guy.(Listening to the Rat pack and plenty of beer help a ton)My gf(or ex now) is looking for work and to get her drivers license(she has been afraid to get it for years)  so, as her longtime friend and since shes my sons mother, im helping her by providing this houshold, transport and food until she is on her own.

We are early-mid twenties, been together for a bit over a year.
Early in the relationship I shaved his initial into my pubic hair once as a fun, flirty thing to do. We kept it up for a while, but eventually stopped. This was like 4mo/5mo. No issue with me not shaving it in since that time. Recently it grew out a bit more than usual, and now he wants me to put his initial back.

I kind of just don't want to. Nothing personal. Not cheating. Nothing. And I have a gyno appt this week. But, to put it in simplest terms, I just want to shave my pubic hair how I want to shave it.

Now he's telling me I'm all about ""feminism"" and ""self control"", that I ""just don't care"" and that he ""doesn't have things that are really 'his' in the relationship"". Uh, okay? Is this just a temper tantrum or something more serious?

I tried telling him it was petty and his response was ""no it's not, you used to want to do these things, and now...for some reason...you don't. and it just makes me wonder why.""

New quote: ""This is not sexy. It used to be sexy cause you'd just do it. I'm not going to be a pussy ass who doesnt have control over what is or is not in your pubic hair.""

It's a long story. About 18 days ago, my mom told me that my old babysitter had been in a car accident. And I remembered some things...to put it bluntly, she raped me. I was 13, she was 19, and she threatened me and hurt me until I complied. I pushed it down and forced myself to forget until my mom brought her up again. I posted a few questions on [/r/rapecounseling](/r/rapecounseling) and actually understood for the first time in my life what had happened.

My girlfriend of a few months (friend for two years before that) obviously found it weird that all of a sudden I was avoiding her, so she pestered me until I realized I had to tell her. I sat her down in a quiet, private place, and admitted to her what had happened.

She slapped me.

She started shouting that I was mocking ""real"" rape victims, and that one of her friends had been molested and I couldn't understand how serious it really was. She basically said that she was breaking up with me for thinking my rape was as bad as the rape of any girl.

She left and I watched her drive away. And then...

Well, I stepped out into traffic on a busy road. That's about all I can say. I just walked right out into the road and let a car hit me. I woke up in the hospital. I broke my left shoulder and some ribs, but I'm going to be fine, according to the doctors. The reason they're keeping me is that they want to make sure I'm not suicidal. And right now I'm not, it was just...the heat of the moment, you know, I didn't really want to be still breathing. It's hard to describe. But my mom called me in the hospital and she helped me convince myself to keep my head above water for now.

My girlfriend sent roses for me, and she hasn't changed her facebook status from ""in a relationship with [me]"" yet, even though she ""broke up with me"".

She also deleted many of my work files.

I was really surprised from this behavior and I politely asked her why, according to her is because she didn't like the pictures and that I kept hidden many of them from her eyes.

They weren't hidden, just in the picture folder, old pictures that I thought didn't have any significance to her, she deleted my other files for spite.

Lucky me I had many backups (she's not aware of this) and I was able to restore some of my work files, some were lost and now I have to waste a huge amount of time redoing a lot of stuff ,the big question is... is she insane?

I have to thank you all, I didn't expect such response.

She is as sharp as a tack, cute as a button, beautiful beyond comprehension...this list could go on forever.  You see, I met her on an online dating site.  Didn't think much of it, I've had very little success with the site.  There was a spark between us, but I expected it to die off just as it did too many times before.  The amazing thing is, it never did.  It grew ever brighter, a lone spark became blinding fireworks.  By the end of the first week we felt like we knew eachother for a lifetime.  I knew exactly when something was bothering her, and the same can be said for her..  We understood eachother's innermost thoughts and feelings.  We were able to see eachother in the deepest sense.  

The next 2 weeks were the best of my life.  The sun shined brighter, the storms never lasted, the world was just a better place.  Every peak at the phone was rewarded with a poem, a sonnet, a confession of love.  She made me feel like the only man on Earth, and I tried my best to make her feel the same.  For the first time in 5 years, I felt like I truly mattered to somebody.

One day I received a call from her.  She was on the other line, in tears, frightened.  I asked her what was wrong and all she said was, ""I need you to be here."" So I left work and drove 3 hours to be by her side.  She was in the ICU and her kidneys were shutting down.  The next 3 weeks were spent by her side.  Through all of the pain, the tears, and suffering...we found ways to continue our love for eachother.  I quit my job for her, and I don't regret it for a second.  And there we found ourselves, just the two of us...no friends, no family.  Two 20 somethings who were complete strangers less than 2 months ago, facing something that most people our age don't think about...death.  It came to the point where she needed a kidney donor and she was at the bottom of a long list.  Before the words left the doctor's mouth, I said I'd be a live donor.  To be given the chance to save the life of somebody so dear to you, I was honored.  People called me crazy for risking my body for her...but the truth is I would have given my life for her if it meant she would suffer no more.  

Before I was scheduled to donate, it was discovered that she had Stage 3 urothelial cell carcinoma.  It was as if my world began to shatter.  That was three weeks ago, and every day that passed was filled with dread, fear, but most importantly love.  We developed a love so pure and deep that her doctors asked us if we were married...at the very least engaged.  Neither of us had the heart to tell her we had barely know eachother for 2 months.  Every day I am greeted with a gift, an artistic creation, an account of last night's dream of me...so many amazing things.  We really did act like a married couple. One day I just decided that I was going to give a name to what we were.  In her hospital bed, I proposed to her.  Navigating all of her IV tubes we embraced eachother and all words escaped us.  Finally she said ""I feel like I'm the only woman in the world."" I kept whispering, ""I love you so much.""  

So here I find myself, the love of my life, the person I would give my life for...and she's fighting for hers.  We both know that our time together is limited, and we're trying to make every second of our time together as fulfilling as possible.  Fear always surfaces and I'm having increasing trouble quelling it.  So I'm asking you, the members of the Reddit community, what can I do to make her life with me the best it can be?

Instead of trying to avoid the rain and thus staying home, go out and live life and know that sometimes it rains out, and if it does rain, so what?  Eventually it stops.

So go ahead and ask that girl out.  Say hi to that cute barista.  Tell your boyfriend you want to do something kinky.  The worst they can do is say ""no.""  The alternative is years later saying ""if only I'd done X.""

During your 10 day ""separation"" she stayed constantly fucked up on valium, percocet, and weed. Within the first 5 days she had already slept with her ""friend"" (redacted) (with no protection). The reason you dont know this is because she said ""it's none of your business."" I think you are a good person and deserve to know the truth before you make such an important change in your life.

I don't know who sent it. I don't know if any of it is true. Just looking for your opinions.

Thanks.

Edit: I am going to have a conversation with her about it after I get off work, so I'll let you guys know.

I told her previously I don't want kids, but this situation is what it is I suppose. Anyway, she suspected it for the past week but never said anything (continuing to drink and smoke), but once we officially confirmed it via a test, she still refuses to stop drinking, smoking cigarettes and pot, and it's pretty disgusting to me.

She brags about how her mom smoked while she was pregnant with her, and that the only side effect was low birth weight, which isn't a big deal. She also said her doctor told her she can smoke pot while pregnant, and that she'd get it in writing for me if I'd like (she has yet to come through with this). She has cut back her smoking to about one cig a day, but still smokes pot pretty heavy (1/4 ounce every 2-3 days).

She calls me selfish for wanting to abort, which she refuses, and then flips out at me for ""judging her"" for smoking constantly, and that she's doing the best she can under the circumstances. She refuses to listen to any online search I do stating the risks of smoking (cigs and pot), and says I don't know what I'm talking about.

I think what's most concerning is that I was going to break up with her. We have been dating for 2 years and were both adamant on our positions about kids (me not wanting, her wanting). Since we're both in our mid 20s, I figured it was time to end it based on that, since it seemed like we were wasting our time if we ultimately wanted different things (tends to be a deal breaker).

I'm willing to do what I have to do to be a father, but that means preventing her from doing any potential harm to the baby. What else can I do to get her to at least listen to me on these issues?

In September last year, I split up with him. I was in the process of moving out when he finally lost it with me and I had to call the police. I told my family everything and they came and picked me and my son up and got us away.

I was being abused, and posting here helped to open my eyes to the way he was treating me. I was incredibly blind to what was going on and it took a while for people's comments to sink in.

I gained residency of my son after a few months of battling through court and haven't felt this happy in a very long time. I'm also taking a course to help me make better choices in relationships in the future and spot early signs of abuse.

I saw a few comments to do a follow up on how things go, and here it is.

I also saw some comments saying how I was going to end up sleeping with him because that's what female logic was and.. I did.


Haha, just kidding! I talked to him about it and told him it hurt my feelings. Well, douchebag there assured me he was just joking and laughed it off like I was stupid because I didn't get that. Followed by the most insulting apology ""Sorry, YOU took it that way."" (Uhh, what other way is there...) Followed by the same day him making a little comment about my weight once more and saying how it's ""cute"" how upset I get.

I was afraid I'd seem stupid for taking a ""joke"" to heart that much and ending something over it, but after confronting him about it multiple times, he would not stop and ignored my feelings. I actually feel better that I ended it rather than keep trying to justify his rude comments.

I told him we shouldn't talk anymore and we haven't talked since then. He has tried to contact me and thinks I just needed time to ""cool off"" but I will not be talking to this guy again.

So no, I did not sleep with him or justify his rude jokes! Currently lost 5 lbs and he has tried contacting me multiple times. Yay for self respect!

**EDIT::** Just to clear things up, I'm not losing weight for him! I've been eating healthy and exercising before him, trying to get back to my normal weight.

All your comments, nice, neutral or degrading, were helpful. It made me realize a few things I didn't know, and helped me to understand things a bit better.

**Original post is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1bwy68/38f_punched_me30m_during_threesome_last_night/)**

So after reading the comments and adding my own, I got off work and had a nice, long commute home, which gave me some more time to think. I got home, and gf was waiting for me, as expected. We stat on the couch and talked about what happened, and what it did to us. She apologized, stating it was a drunken night, and her swinging at me was from her picturing me penetrating friend, and she didn't want to share me. She didn't think about it before, but right as it was about to happen, she did, and reacted wrong. We discussed the fact that it was something new, something kinky, and that is what brought about her tremendous passion, however, I reminded her she had never done some of those things with me, and I had tried. I told her how I felt about her hitting me, and how if the roles were reversed, I'd be either in jail, or chased by gf and her friend with sharp things. If it was any other man, he might have hit her back, and what she did was abuse, in front of someone else. She understood, although she had not though about those ideas. I let her know that I was upset and hurt, and if we break up or stay together, I would still have to work those things out with time. She asked if we were going to break up, because she still loved me, and was quite apologetic for what happened. We agreed both of us were at fault that night.

We stat on the couch for a bit in silence, I was still taking it all in. She tried to hold me and rub my leg a little, but I asked her not to, and she walked away. So I kept to the couch for a bit, unsure of what exactly to do to make things better for me.

I went out for a cig, and she did as well. She said she loved me very much, and we discussed our relationship, and what it meant to her. I asked her if she truly wanted a relationship, after everything that has been done and said. She said yes, of course. I reminded her I would not be in a good place of mind for a few days, and would not be wanting any sexual contact for a little while, with her or anyone else. She understood.

I waited a minute, letting things sink in. I looked her right in the eyes, and in a stern tone, let her know if she ever hit me again like that, I would be gone, no matter what. She understood, and agreed.

I gave it another minute, letting it sink in. Again, right in the eyes, stern voice. I told her I when I come back to myself, I will not be begging for what I want sexually anymore. I'm a 30 year old man, and I should never have to. If she will not help me feel desired or wanted, then I will leave, and find someone who does. I do not deserve that. She got scared, and stated she would be worried I would leave her at any minute, if I felt like it. I told her not to, we both are grown adults, and we have shown each other we can talk about things, and not just run away from the situation. She understood, and we agreed to talk about it.

Again, I appreciate you guys, alot. Go ahead, comment on it.

It's not a sexual thing but I guess just a quick grab and let go, no rubbing, holding, pinching, etc. I'm not pissed about it now but I told her that I don't want another guy grabbing her boobs. Gay or straight, it's not something I'm okay with.

She was surprised about it. Even tried to defend it and talk me into being okay with it. Immediately I stated very clearly and directly, ""I don't care if they're gay, bi, or straight I don't want other guys grabbing your boobs. End of story. I don't like it, I'm not comfortable with it, and if it keeps happening then I'm going to get pissed off.""

Normally that would be that, but after my brothers wife found out she too was surprised that I wasn't okay with it. On top of that last night even as me and my girl are laying in bed naked cuddling and about to have sex she brought it up again that she didn't understand why I have a problem with it.

So is this a common thing that I've managed to go 26 years without knowing? Is there some kind of social thing between gay guys and girls that even when the girl is in a relationship it's acceptable for him to grab her boobs? Is my opinion in the minority here?

Oddly, I feel like I can finally begin some healing now that she has at least fessed up to what she has done.  I'm just going to take some time for myslef over the next few days and try to figure some stuff out.

Original posts [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway142012/submitted/)

The past 7 months have had a lot of ups and downs.  I'm in a much better place than I used to be, but still on the road to recovery.  I go to therapy 3 times a month.  I started running and working out frequently.  I dropped from 245 pounds in February to 205 pounds this morning.  I feel so much more in shape and for the first time since high school I feel good about my body.  The change has caused me to have to buy all new clothes, so I'm slowly updating my wardrobe and dressing (and subsequently feeling) better.  

I have a large pool of friends now.  The friends that I spent New Years Eve with hang out every Tuesday for trivia, and we went to the beach a few times this spring and summer.  I practice with my band three times a week now, and our album was just released for free online.  We hang out several times a week.  My best friend right now is a girl I met on reddit, unrelated to these posts.  We text every day and hang out every other night, and if one of us absent for more than two days we miss each other a lot.

I took a trip to Puerto Rico with my mom and my Aunt back in May, and it was a life changing experience.  No sightseeing or touristing, my mom grew up there and we were visiting family.  I got to experience the real culture and my heritage (I currently live in a predominantly white suburb).  When I came back I was much more calm and finally had a positive outlook on life.

As for my ex - the easiest, cheapest, and most painless way for us to divorce is on irreconcilable differences.  For my state, that requires 18 months of living in separate residences while not having sex with each other.  No problem there, 6 months down, 12 to go.  I look forward to the day she no longer disgraces my last name.  There is so much she is still lying to me about and so much I will never know the truth about.

For a while we talked about spending time apart and after a while see if there was something there to save.  She called me to meet with her a few months later and after a long and deceitful amount of small talk she told me she had given up.  She no longer wanted me back, she had quit therapy, and I know for a fact she is currently dating one of the guys she cheated on me with.  To be honest, good for her.  She will either wake up one day and realize how much better her life could have been with me, or she'll have a better life with this guy.  Either way, I never would have wanted to hold her back from a higher state of happiness.  In the meantime, I never want to see her again, outside of a courtroom.

To cope with my deflated ego, I went through a period of sexual promiscuity.  I picked up some self help books, hit up /r/seduction, and took my new body to college parties.  I went on dates with old friends I hadn't seen in 5 years.  I slept around, with girls as old as 30 and as young as 18.  To be perfectly honest, none of that made me feel any better.  I thought that I wanted to feel young again and sow my wild oats, but the truth is I just wanted to be loved.

So I'm actually dating someone right now.  We connect deeply on a mental and physical level, and being with her makes me feel like I can love again.  She lives an hour away, which I find to be a good thing because it keeps this from turning into a codependent relationship.  I retain my independence, while still having someone who cares for me and goes out with me a few times a week.  Will it last?  Don't know, don't care.  Living in the moment has been one of my coping mechanisms this year, so long as I live responsibly.  When I'm with her, I'm happy, and that's all I care about.

So this is getting long, but I wanted to thank all of the supportive commenters on reddit.  Many of you offered good advice that I took to heart, and some of you even reached out to me on facebook.  I may have been slightly jaded at the time, but the show of compassion and empathy from strangers has been truly heartwarming.  I like the new me, and I hope to be better for the experience.

I've only barely brushed the surface with this post, so feel free to ask me anything.

It didn't even occur to me when I started flirting with her that she'd become interested in me. She seemed way out of my league--crazy intelligent, talented, funny and amazingly good-looking... and she already had a boyfriend. I talked to her anyway, thinking, ""What the heck? I could use the practice, and it wouldn't hurt to become friends with her,"" but I was intimidated and barely spoke to her. The class we had together ended, and I figured I'd never see her again. Fine by me.

Then, at the beginning of the next semester, who do I see when I walk into a new class but her. I sat next to her and we quickly became very good friends. Before long, we were talking on facebook, making inside jokes, and even watching movies together at my house... but she still had a boyfriend, and I wouldn't help a girl cheat. While we still flirted, we were, by definition, friends.

Eventually, she came to me with a problem--she couldn't tell any of her other friends because they were all part of the same circle and her secret would never keep. She told me that her boyfriend wouldn't stop pressuring her to sleep with him, and she was at her wits' end. As much as I would've liked to tell her to dump him, I recommended trying to communicate, trying to make it clear to him how uncomfortable that would make her, etc.

Over the summer, it became clear that she liked me, and we spoke even more, while her boyfriend ignored her (since she was out of the country). When she finally returned, after having ignored her all summer long, he tried to make a move on her the first time he saw her. It became clear what she needed to do.

A couple days ago, she broke up with him. She was very upset, so I invited her to meet me so I could comfort her. We ended up sitting on my couch late at night, talking, laughing, enjoying each other--and I kissed her.

The problem? I'm gay.

I'm physically attracted to men and not women, and I'd been meaning to tell her before I asked her out.

I didn't get the opportunity to tell her. We started making out passionately and before long, to my enormous surprised, I got extremely aroused, and it quickly became apparent that she did, too. It makes absolutely not sense to me, but it was all I could do not to try to seduce her right there.

I've never been physically attracted to girls, ever. In this case, I wasn't even turned on by her body; I was turned on by the fact that she wanted me so badly, and that I have such strong feelings for her. I wanted to make her feel amazing. I could've, and that idea caused me to be almost the most aroused I'd ever been in my whole life.

So I asked her out. She's my girlfriend now, and I'm her boyfriend, but... As ridiculously happy as I am, as much as it feels like I'm living in a wonderful, impossible dream, I've constantly got a sinking feeling in my stomach. I have to tell her that I'm... what? Gay? Bisexual? Gay but attracted to her? All I know is that I have to tell her, but I don't know WHAT to tell her.

Please help me, reddit. I don't know what the fuck is going on, or what to do.

TL;DR: Flirted with an amazing girl, not expecting for her to be interested. We ended up going out before I could tell her that I'm gay, but in the process I realized I'm sexually attracted to her. I obviously have to tell her something... but what? Where do I go from here?

I'm a little bit less confused than before, and I've got a good feeling about how it's going to go (but I'll still keep my fingers crossed).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Reddit. Wow, first thanks to everyone who replied to my original thread. I knew that infidelity posts seem to go viral on here but the response was overwhelming. I wanna just say **thank you** to everyone who replied. I'm posting this update because when I'm on reddit I really appreciate people that spend the time to tell me how they've got on after I've invested in their story. First, just to clarify - I know I came off as a materialistic jackass in my original post but I don't look down on anyone less well off or anything. The comments about the vegans shitty SUV, boots etc I said out of anger - not because I hate poor people. Money does mean a lot to me but my ex-girlfriend meant a lot more. Family, friends, loved ones all come above my work.

So it's been about a week now since it happened and I can just say this Reddit - I'm heartbroken. I was angry and confused last time I posted but now I'm just lonely and devastated. I've been taking long walks in the evening, smoking about a dozen cigarettes and then just finding a quiet place to sob my eyes out. My self esteem has taken a turn for the worse - I've reconnected my phone now and I seem to be staring at it waiting to hear from her constantly, waiting to hear her beg for me back. It hasn't happened like that though.

The day after I posted on Reddit I met up with her at a Starbucks to find out some answers to my question - **Why?**. The truth is she didn't have any. She said that she didn't know why she did it. That she does love me and that she does want to marry me but that sometimes when she was with me lately she just didn't feel like she really wanted to be there. Then I said that I feel like that sometimes but I don't go out and fuck waitresses. The she turned and went all crazy - saying I'm too possessive and that she should have some freedom. She said that cheating happens everyday and  I shouldn't take it so personal. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Then the tears came. And then the begging. I asked her what it is she loved about me and she couldn't say anything beyond the standard clichés. I listed off a huge string of things about her and finally said ""Those where things I love**ed** about you."" I told her how betrayed I felt. How I never imagined being in another relationship apart from ours in my whole life ever again. I told her that this was probably the worst thing that anyone had done to me personally in my whole life. Her tears set me off and before I knew it we're two bawling idiots sat in Starbucks with everyone looking at us. Finally I told her that despite how destroyed I was now - that there were some signs that it was coming anyway. I told her that I don't think she felt the same way about the relationship as I did - at least not in the last year. She was still crying and I said: *""Joanne, thank you some of the best years of my life and go fuck yourself for ruining them. I'll send your stuff over tomorrow, you can keep everything I have apart from the ring and my external hard drive.""* The next day a mutual friend went over to hers and dropped her stuff off and picked up my external. I took the ring off her at Starbucks. 

Since then well, it hasn't been pretty. I've been smoking so much. I never usually smoke. I must be going through 20 cigarettes a day. I suppose it's better in the short term than alcohol. The worst bits are finding things that remind me of her, finding some PJ's she'd left here in the wash, smelling her perfume walking past a chick in town, seeing her shampoo in the shower, coming across pictures on my computer. All of it takes a toll.

Anyway, things are overall pretty great.  Sex is amazing (we have sex almost every day, some days more than one time a day) and do almost everything together.  She's got a great family and a brother I go fishing with every weekend and I'm becoming pretty close with them.  We've gotten in a few fights (that weren't that big) which admittedly involved an ex- of mine who I see somewhat often because of mutual friends, though I never do anything with my ex- unless she happens to be at a social gathering and even then we don't really talk a whole lot.  Not that the breakup was bad or anything, we just don't have a lot in common (which is pretty much why it ended).


Anyway, to get to the point, like I said, everything has been great until the other day.  My girlfriend is visiting a friend and is away for a few days so I've been going over to her place to feed her fish.  Well, I was rummaging through her freezer which is a mess with boxes and crap looking for some ice pops that might have gotten lost when I found a rolled up plastic sandwich bag.  At first I thought it was pot and was sort of surprised because neither of us smoke marijuana but when I opened it up I found a disposed condom that had been tied with a knot.  Admittedly this is how I dispose of the condoms after we have sex.  I tie it off and throw it in the trash.  That means she dug it out of the trash and put it in the freezer.


I have no clue what to make of this but it's distressing.  The only thing I can think is she's saving it to get herself pregnant.  Is this even possible?  What should I do?  


**edit**: Thanks for all the comments and feedback. I've decided not to say anything about it to her until she gets back but that's not until tomorrow evening and she's definitely going to text or call me tomorrow (I texted her saying I'm tired and going to bed.. she's out at a bar so too busy to want to talk fortunately) but she's gonna call me tomorrow.  I'm going to try and act normal and ask her when she gets back.


In response to some of the comments:  As I said, I have no clue why she would save it.  Everything in our relationship has been normal and great which is why I want to get input from others.  I don't want to ask my friends about it as I don't want them knowing about it right now before I've talked to her. I really have no idea what to make of this and it just seems really weird to me.  Good to know the sperm is not viable.  I don't know if she would realize this but she's definitely not stupid and I think she would probably look into this before doing it so there may be other reasons.


I'm not 100% sure it's mine but like I said, we spend most of our time together, meaning, we always sleep together when we're not away, whether it's my place or her place.  I can't imagine she'd be cheating as I don't know when that could take place.  It might be old.. it's hard to really know.  It definitely looks like the condoms I toss but that's not saying much I suppose.  I don't think I could pick my condom out of a lineup.


I can't imagine she wants to use it to frame me for sexual assault.  We've been together for a year and know each other's families.. it just doesn't make sense.

Engaged for going on 2. Wedding is in August. He got a job in another state, so he has been living there by himself. I am in grad school and can't leave until graduation in May. He has been gone for two months, and came home to visit for my spring break this week. 

After a night at his hometown bar, I got a texts from a girl in his new city who told me that they had been dating for the past couple of weeks and had slept together several times. She had a photo of the two of them together, and re-sent the photo that he had texted to both of us (hence, how she got my number). She also sent a picture of the hotel bill from the night before he left to come back here, which upon investigation, he has a copy of in his email. His email is open on his computer. Not exactly trying to hide it.

He is currently passed out drunk in bed, so is no use talking to. I'm panicking. And don't really know how to go about this. The wedding is planned. Paid for. People have bought flights. But I don't think I can marry him if this is true.

I thought we were happy. How does one cheat on someone they love? And is there any coming back from this?

tl;dr: Fiance cheated on me. Wedding is sooooooon. What to do?

UPDATE: I confronted him about the texts in a civilized manner. Not to say that I didn't lose it later. He admitted to everything. Blamed it on the fact that he was lonely. He's so ashamed, made the biggest mistake of his life, hates himself, will do whatever it takes to make it right, blah blah blah. As of yet, the wedding is ""postponed indefinitely"", but that's only until I can figure out something to tell my mom. He left for lunch with his parents. It will be interesting to see how that pans out.

I had coffee with a friend who calmed me down. She said that people can work through these things, but it takes time and a looooot of counseling/talking/whatever. Certainly not enough to allow getting married in August. I'm going to take some time for myself and focus on what I want out of this. Some time apart will be good for me.

",sleepinginmybed,198,30,144,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hud56/wife_came_out_of_the_closet_and_wants_to_end_the/,"Throw away account because she is also a redditor. I'll try to make this short but thanks for clicking my post nonetheless. 

Known her for 10 years, Married for 4 next month. So, about 2 weeks ago, while I was making dinner in the kitchen, my wife approaches me and tells me she made out with a girl. I was heavy in to my cooking so I couldn't really just stop what I was doing and take in everything that was said. I was more like-

..*""..oh, ..alright""*.
her: *""so what do you think?""*
me: *""why are you telling me this now?""*
her: *""so you wouldn't be able to walk out on me""*
me: *""why would I do that?""*

I fucked up right there. I didn't really convey what I was truly feeling (which was confusion) and it led to her thinking I was alright with it. From there she began to downplay her ""experiment"" saying that they were watching a movie and starting making out. She showed me the hickies and confessed that part of why I was finding out was because she wouldn't be able to hide them (huge red flag, or no?). She begins telling me that she wants me to be okay with it and it's just an experimental phase. 

I recall times where she mentions she was always curious about women and I, cowardly trying to justify the reasons of why this is happening, began to brush it off as something minor. But, after a bit of delay, my foresight kicks in and I begin visualizing problems that can arise from this. 

* She may realize how much she likes being with this girl more than she does with me. 
* This may be something I will hold against her if I ever fuck up myself in the marriage, not fair for the both of us. 
* Bringing STD's in from her other ""partner"".
* I work a lot of nights and travel for business. I'm worried she will become unsupportive of me when I'm homesick and I'll obsess about who she might be with. 

I bring up all four points to her explaining in detail of each one. Somehow, I was convinced that none of these things would happen and nothing will come out of this experimental relationship. I end it with, ""I'm fine with this but you have to promise that [girl's name] doesn't know that I know. I don't want it to be awkward"" From there it was done, dinner is served and we called it a night.

**Last Week:**

We go out to a friend's party at a local venue. I disappear outside with a friend for a smoke but when I get back, my wife is no where to be found. I give it a good 15-20 minutes before I go looking for her and I catch her and her ""girlfriend"" embraced in what you see on the cover of some romance drama dvd where a dude has a chick pinned up against the wall in the rain. They both see me. I approach them non-threateningly with a ""hey, there you guys are! why don't you come in?"". At this point the other girl is obviously scared of what I might do but I proceed to act that I knew about their relationship all along. I try to invite them inside but my wife says she'll catch up. I go in and my wife follows without her girl. 

It finally hits home that this may not be a fling and seeing it was obviously worse than just hearing about it. I'm kind of angered/ heart-broken that my wife would leave my side to make out with her girlfriend. Night was ruined, but we didn't talk about it. 

**Last Night:**

She stands me up as I wait for her to get home so we can watch a movie. I call her and she tells me she's hanging out with people and she forgot. It's not like her to forget and I knew what she was really doing. I'm left waiting until late at night until she finally gets home. From there I let it all out, I didn't like what she was doing and it was starting to affect me. I tell her that her girlfriend shouldn't be a priority over me or the marriage and I told her I didn't want her girlfriend in our house ever again. I told her I wanted it to stop and I broke down in tears. Then, she tells me.. or she hints at rather, that this wasn't going to end now and she wants to live the life she wants to live. I had no control, I got that. It escalated from there and somehow we ended up talking about living separately and possibly a divorce. There is more to this part that I'll put at the end.. it's just more sob story b.s. 

**Start emotional ramble:**
I don't know what to do or if I can even find anyone to relate with. I feel pretty alone in this and would like some input. I love her very much and I'll admit, our relationship has been fairly rocky (married young) and I'm going to attribute this to the ""growing into ourselves, separately"" category. We've always pulled through in the past but I'm not so sure about now. I'm pissed because it feels so fucked up and selfish of her to be so quick to throw this away now. I've become very untrustworthy of her (she hides texts, sneaks out at night) and it's starting to eat away at me. A part of me is willing to end it because I just can't stomach the hiding and the lies. I told her I wished she was more open with what she was doing and maybe I'd be more accepting of it.



**TL;DR:** Despite what you may think, it's just as bad as if she left me for another guy.

edit: I realize she may stumble upon this because I don't think there are many ""wife is leaving me for a chick"" posts around. 

edit 2: I'm so glad I posted this up. Feeling slightly better thanks to you guys. I've got to sleep (or try to actually).. to be up at 5 am so I'll check my messages at work tomorrow. Thanks so much folks.

She gets concert tickets for Christmas, naturally I assume I'm going with her.  Nope.  She wants to take someone from work because he is supposedly a huge fan of the band.  She also tells me he's gay.  I am upset, but I decide not to start a fight about it.  She goes to the concert and they wait outside near the band bus after the show is over.  The bassist from the band starts to talk to her, and she flirts with him.  He asks if she is going to their new years eve show, 200 miles away.  She says no because she can't afford it.  He said he'll comp her tickets if she comes.  She says she won't go alone.  He says she can bring her friend.

Now our new years eve plans are ruined, because there's no way I can go too.  She had joked before about having to sleep with the bassist for these tickets and VIP access.  I did not find it funny, so she played it off.  In the end, this is her favorite band, and I don't want her holding this over my head for the rest of our lives, so I let her make the decision herself.  She decides to go with her friend from work (who she now says she's only 80% sure he's gay, WTF?).

She texts me on the long drive there.  Then when she gets the tickets, then nothing.  I text her at midnight, she gives me a three word response.  I don't hear from her again.  I call her at 11:30 the next morning, and she says she is waiting at the subway station to go back to HER hotel.  She eventually gets home around 4:30 pm.  

I ask her how it went, she says they partied all night, she took prescription drugs and drank a lot.  She said she was pissed she paid for a hotel when she only slept in it for two hours.  I asked how that was possible when she was at the subway at 11:30am.  She admits that she didnt use the hotel room at all, and that she must have slept in the band suite (what?).  She blames her amnesia on a hangover.

Fast forward a day or so.  She gets out of the shower, I notice she shaved her pubes.  I ask her when she did it, she says friday.  Here's the thing.  My wife NEVER shaves her pubes.  When she does, it's a present for me!  She left for work and I found a package of summer's eve feminine wipes in her overnight bag.  Here's the other thing, I've always secretly thought she's had an odor problem, but she's certainly never done anything about it for me.  This was a brand new pack, why did she have them?

So what do you think?  Is she cheating?  With the bassist, or the guy from work?  Should I confront her about it?

**TL;DR - Wife goes to a concert with a guy from work on NYE.  Stays up all night in band suite.  Can't get her story straight.  Abnormal attention to vaginal hygiene.**

Edit: Sorry this is such a horrible read.  I'm literally shaking as I writing this since I don't know what to do.

Edit 2: This is a fucked up situation for sure.  But I should mention there's a reason we got married.  She and I share an affinity for so many things, from music to gaming to trees to other nerdy stuff.  Some people might consider us a couple that spends TOO much time together.  The sex life has cooled off a bit, but neither of us has been left wanting.  Not sure if any of this changes things.

Edit 3:  I think I should clarify that she got the concert tickets as a Christmas gift, but the concert was not on Christmas.  The first concert was on December 30th.  The second was December 31st.

Edit 4:  I'm trying to avoid keywords that might lead her to this thread, so I won't name the band.  It's not Nickelback and it's definitely not Phish.

Edit 5:  She'll be home soon.  Wish me luck.

**Update:**  I sat her down last night for a talk.  I asked her to walk me through the night so I could better understand the details.  They had tickets waiting at will call, and were able to stand in the VIP section for the concert.  The bar was open until about 2:00, at which point they were invited to the band suite.  The hotel gave her free pijamas, so she wasn't wearing her dress when she went up there.  It was a pretty large party, with the bassist, guitarist, cellist from the opening band, and the entire road crew.  She said her friend from work was hovering around her all night, to the point of being annoying.  She said she fell asleep on the floor of the living room, as did a dozen other people.  Her coworker woke her up around 11 and they went to the subway.

I asked her why she shaved, she said she doesn't know.  ""What if I ended up going swimming?""  she said.  ""Did you bring a bathing suit?"" I asked.  ""No.""  Not to mention the fact that my wife can't swim.  She'll drown in 6ft of water with nothing to hold on to.  We enjoy hot tubs, though I still wouldn't have been comfortable with her in a hot tub full of strangers.  I asked her about the summer's eve cleansing cloths.  She admitted they were for feminine odor, but said she bought them during our last Walmart shopping trip, which was the day after Christmas.  If that's true, she couldn't have known she was sleeping out without me on NYE.  She said she didn't even open them.  When I checked the package again, I was positive it was unopened.

I asked her to look me in the eyes and swear that there was no kissing, cuddling, or sexual contact of any kind.  She did so, repeating those exact words.

I also told her how hurt I was about the whole situation.  I told her that if she has tickets to something, and I want to go, she is obligated to take me no matter what.  If she isn't ready to make that call, then she wasn't ready for marriage.  She was very resistant and used a lot of hyperbole in the conversation (you always this, I never that).  The most hurtful thing she said to me was that if I was able to go on NYE, she thinks she wouldn't have had as much fun.  I told her that's a fundamental blow to our relationship that should call our marriage into question.  She said I was being ridiculous.

So I'm pretty much right back where I started.  Still not sure if she cheated.  It's possible she lied.  I have no way of knowing.  She's acting pretty much normal at home, as if nothing happened.  Still don't know what to do.  I'm going to leave this up for another day or so, then take it down so she doesn't see it.

&gt;Sound advice. I'm 32 now, married happily, and I feel fully satisfied that I sowed my wild oats, as you young people say. I have quite a bit to say on the matter Moridyn brings up, but I will try to start with some brief points.

&gt;The most important things to know about pleasing a woman (a list of perhaps a dozen important things, based on my experiences pleasing many women):

&gt;1. Comfort. A lot of her orgasm depends on her mental state, and she's probably nervous about her performance, she might be nervous about her sexual prowess, her breath, what you think of what she's wearing, if she did or said anything foolish... You need to make her feel totally comfortable and un-judged. Make her feel safe and protected. You are cool, confident and in control. Let her see that, and let her see that you approve of her and see her as desirable and sexy.

&gt;2. Audible feedback: moans, words of approval like ""Yes"" and things like ""You have no idea how good that feels"" will boost her confidence that she is doing well. She is most likely just as invested in your pleasure as you are in hers, and stroking her ego will stoke her fires and make her more eager to please.

&gt;3. Every girl is different, and it's important to be receptive to the feedback you get, whether they tell you what they want or if their body shows you if they're enjoying it or not.



&gt;     Explore, experiment, adapt. Don't be afraid to be a little bit rough, once you're in the act. While every girl wants to be respected, she also want you to be shocked and pleased by what a dirty little whore she can be. When she's feeling confident, she also wants to feel manhandled and used. It's a different line for every girl, so you have to be careful and pay attention while riding it.

&gt;4. Keep sex friendly. Whether it's casual or serious, stay comfortable about it and just let it go when things go wrong, get weird or are embarrassing; the ability to laugh and brush those things off with a little joke is a sign of maturity and being in control.

&gt;5. If you have any lesbian friends, learn everything you can about cunnilingus from them. they are a valuable source of knowledge on the subject, and sometimes they end up not being as lesbian as you thought they were. If lesbians are scarce, learn through trial and error. Push up the skin on either side of the hood, at the top of the vaginal opening to expose the clitoris. Hold like this to increase blood flow to the area and intensify physical sensation and strength of orgasm. Place your upper lip against the pubis just north of the clit with a bit of pressure. Make your tongue flat and wide, then touch the clit using constant contact. make small steady downward thrusting motions with your tongue, don't lick it up--that's like rubbing a cat's fur the wrong way. Keep the rhythm and pressure steady. Her moans will cue you in about when to go faster. Just follow her rhythm when her tempo speeds. If you slip a bit, you can place your entire mouth around the clit and suck for awhile, but don't change things up too much, it will frustrate her instead of building momentum. When she does reach orgasm, now is the time to stop licking or it will be painfully intense and she'll shove you away. Instead, open your mouth somewhat wide around the clit and apply pressure, grab her hips and let her ride it out.




&gt;    This is general advice, every girl is different and your mileage will vary.

&gt;6. Most breakups happen because things about you and things about her are bringing out bad qualities in each other. That doesn't mean she's a crazy fucking bitch, it means that you're not being good for each other and you don't think it's worth trying to work it out. Everyone has a point at which it feels like more work than fun. 




&gt;    If you've gotta break her heart, do it gracefully, and with respect--even if you're angry with her--because it's going to influence her future interactions with other men. Don't put all the blame on her, and don't be passive aggressive. Tell her you wish things were different, but it's just not working out and you want to end it. Don't let her drag you into a fight or put you on the defensive. Tell her that things are too emotional right now to have a worthwhile discussion, and when you're both able to talk it out calmly, you'll be willing to talk it out with her, just not now.



&gt;    At your age, girls are still fresh and hopeful, filled with excitement about their new bodies and bursting with hormones (and typically less likely to have STDs). They haven't had their hearts stepped on a dozen times, and so they don't have mental scars from past boyfriends to project onto your every word and action. The more careful you are with each heart, the more of them will survive into their twenties or even thirties without becoming completely cynical and jaded.

&gt;7. You are probably not going to meet a girl you should marry before you're through college. It's not that you won't find someone to love intensely, it's that all of the changes that will shape your life and take you to different places are very rarely going to bring you closer, and far more likely to pull you apart. So love, and love freely, and let love go freely, too. Be graceful about it. 

&gt;8. Sometimes the plain girls are unbelievably better in bed than the hot ones. Not always, but it's definitely worth your effort. Fuck what your friends think, you know something they don't know. Also, girls talk. If you treat her right, every single girl she knows will know just how good in bed you are. This has serious advantages in the long run.

&gt;9. Don't be afraid of them. Being rejected happens, and it's better to get it over with and build up a thick skin than to never pluck up the courage to try. Also, try to be ready with some responses to rejection. Sometimes persistence can win the day, sometimes you'll just cut your losses, but always show dignity, grace and class. If a girl tries to make you feel small for asking her out, she just did you a favor. 




&gt;    She showed you that you can do a lot better than her before you even wasted a dime on her. That's one girl off your list, and a thousand more to get to know.

&gt;10. Have fun. The goal should never be to score, that's a great way to sabotage the whole thing. The goal should be to have a great time with this girl. Try keeping this in mind and you'll be surprised how, magically, it will lead to a lot more sex than trying to score ever did.

&gt;11. Girls appreciate little creative romantic gestures. There are all sorts of things you can do. Simple, classic things like flowers or candles (but for fucksake, don't leave them burning and start a fire. Low temperature candles(like the $1 Santeria candles at grocery stores) can be safely dripped on bodies, just test it out on yourself first to make sure you're not going to burn the shit out of the poor girl. A water glass with ice cubes in the summer makes another awesome, free sex toy. Reach over partway through and rub a piece of ice down her sweaty body, around her nipples, across her lips.




&gt;    Girls loves notes or poems folded into origami. Learn how to make a napkin into a rose. Maybe learn a couple magic tricks. Often florists will sweep up fallen rose petals and bag them for you, for free or really cheap. You can scatter rose petals on the carpet and the bed, or in a bath. You can use thumb tacks to hang dental floss from the ceiling, tie a weighted bead to the bottom so it hangs straight, then use a hot glue gun to glue rose petals around it in a spiral, making a spinning stream of rose petals.




&gt;    I explained this plan to a woman at a flower shop once. She gave me ten dozen roses worth of petals for free, which I used to create a curtain waterfall of rose petals  surrounding a girl's bed. 




&gt;    You can do much simpler things. Girls love to steal a piece of clothing that smells like you. Girls are very smell-oriented creatures. Pick a nice cologne, or take her with you to a store and let her pick it for you. That smell will remind her of you for years after you've broken up.




&gt;    Cook for her. Write her a song. Take her on a picnic. Spread a blanket by a lake and play the song for her on your guitar. Take up photography. Take her picture. Learn to draw or paint. Get her to pose for you. You have all of these options.

&gt;12\. Don't let the bastards grind you down. 




&gt;    Your heart will be broken. You will feel cynical and jaded. You'll feel like you've been made a fool. You'll demand an explanation. You'll tell yourself you'll never let another girl make you feel this way again. You'll feel misogynistic and make nasty statements about women. You'll listen to angry music and write breakup poetry, dressed in black and refusing to smile. Then, you'll meet another girl and fall for her. 




&gt;    Try to keep the perspective proper. There's a great line from the movie Suicide Kings. Sean Patrick Flannery is telling Christopher Walken about how amazing his girlfriend is.




&gt;Sean Patrick Flannery:  She's the kind of woman that'd make your heart stop. And then start it back up again. You know any women like that? 



&gt;Christopher Fucking Walken: *Yeah*. All of them.

Basically she admitted to having sex on their holiday also because she contracted herpes (karma i guess) and needed to see the doctor. She then admitted to having sex blaming it on being drunk and regretting it ever since. 

At the end of the long conversation of how this came about and her trying to mend the relationship, I asked her if it happened more than once while drunk. She didn't respond to my question and instead her eyes welled up in silence. Obviously that's sign enough I walked away and I guess that's that. Have to get my stuff from her appartement though so i guess i'd better do that sooner than later.

Too bad because I really loved her but this is something I just can't forgive. I just have a hard time coping with the fact that 2 people I held very dearly are capable of doing this (multiple times even).

Would this be grounds for you to break up with your significant other?,Kellisadvice2,212,48,316,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1cj5xh/friends_say_its_rape_but_i_dont_know_would_this/,"My boyfriend and I have been having trouble for the past couple weeks and I have been turning down sex. Last weekend, we both got fairly drunk. When we went back to the room, he tried to initiate sex and I told him I wanted to sleep and we could do it tomorrow. I kinda pass out but black in to him having sex with me while saying ""I'm sorry"" repeatedly. I let him then after a while roll over to go to sleep. He keeps trying to put it in, after I say it hurts. He says okay we can do it in the morning and makes me promise that we can have sex in the morning. I wake up a little bit later and he has it in and is having sex with me. Once more I roll over and ask to go to sleep and if we can please do it later. I fall asleep and then again, he rolls me on top and has sex with me, even though I am almost black out and doing nothing. It goes on for about a minute of just me laying there till I stop and say I am going to sleep and to stop trying. The next morning I play dumb and say I don't remember anything. He says we had super hot sex and I was really into it. I was upset but at the same time he was very drunk too, and said that there were parts he doesn't remember either. However, he continued to use how much I enjoyed the sex from the night before in order to convince me to do it again.  My friends say I should break up with him because it is technically rape but I don't know as we have been dating for about two years. What should I do? 

I agree that rape is a harsh word as I don't think he had any intention of really hurting me and it wasn't violent. Plus he could have been fairly drunk.  The reason I pretended to be black out is because I had woken up the week before sore (like from having sex) and didn't remember doing it (after a night of drinking).  I asked him if we had sex and he said yes. I asked him if I had been passed out and he said he didn't know. I wanted to see if it would happen again. 

I really do love him which is why it is hard to classify this as rape. I just didn't know if this happens to other people. 

Edit: made things more clear
Edit: we talked last night and he said the only thing he remembers is me on top having a great time. I told him exactly what I remember and he told me he remembers it differently. He said ""I may have gone on for a while, but I stopped eventually"". However, when I brought up the subject, he immediately jumped to ""so are you saying I raped you?!"" which makes me think he knew it was wrong. We are going to have another talk today. Thanks for all the advice, I understand where everyone is coming from but it is possible that he is telling the truth. Ill see what happens today before I make a decision, but your advice has made me see that this is not okay.

This morning, I got up at 6am to get the children ready for school. I should have showered right away and gone to work early, but I wanted to hang out with the dog and drink coffee and didn't need to be at work until 9:30.

My wife woke up at 8:30 in a panic because she hadn't checked her calendar to see that her youngest child has an appointment with a doctor (specialist - hard to get in to see) today. The child is already at school. The appointment is at 9am.

She throws on clothes and starts frantically getting ready. I ask her ""what can I do to help?"" She says ""find my purse"", so I start looking for it. She's stressed complaining she can't find her clothes, etc. It takes me about 3 minutes of looking to find her purse. This does not stop me from being yelled at for not finding it fast enough.

She asks me if I can ""do Lucky"" (a job where we go to someone's house that we used to pet sit for and cycle their blinds and lights because the client is in the process of moving). I say yes and I walk her to the car (carrying her stuff for her) to get the keys from her. I kiss her goodbye, go back inside and turn the water on for my shower. I've got to hurry now because I've got an extra stop on the way to work that is 20 minutes out of the way.

Before I get in the shower my phone rings. Its my wife. She's asking where the child's hand brace is. I say I don't know. She tells me where to look and I find it. Now she's pissed because she needs it for the appointment. I say ""Do you want me to meet you in the driveway with it? Do you need me to drive it to the appointment? Should I delay my shower?"" She says, ""No just hurry and take your shower."" She also tells me that the car is low on gas and she's quite upset about this because I was the last one to drive it (last night when I went to ""do Lucky"" for her).

I shower. I get out of the shower. I check my phone. Several texts from her. The last one says ""here!"".

I look out the window, the car is outside. I walk the handbrace out to the car naked, with a towel wrapped around me, no shoes still dripping wet. It is cold outside. She says ""Can you help me..."" (looks at me in the towel) ""...no you can't.""

I go inside, finish drying off, start getting dressed. It suddenly occurs to me that she is moving her things from the car that is low on gas to the car that has a flat tire (the car she normally ""should be"" driving). I text her and remind her that car has a flat tire. I put on my underwear and shirt. She has texted back, ""Shit!"" and ""I need you!!"" ""Right now, pls!!"".

I text back, ""What do you need?"" and then put on sockets, shoes, pants. Just as I'm tying my shoes the phone rings. Its her. She's pissed because I texted ""What do you need?"". I was intending to ask her if she needed me to *bring* her something from in the house. She is pissed because I didn't help her move the child and her things back and forth between the two cars which she ""wasted several minutes on"" which is my fault because I didn't remind her that her car has a flat tire before she moved her things. I asked her, ""did you expect me to just come outside in my towel again not even knowing what you want?"" She said ""yes"". Ugh.

So, now she's just yelling at me about the gas, the flat tire, etc. as she drives to the 9am doctors appointment. I remind her that its now 9:03 and I have to be at work for a 9:30 meeting AND I have to stop and ""do lucky"" for her.

I agree that our life is complicated. Especially hers because she does different things every day. She doesn't just get up and go to the same place each day. Kids have appointments. There is soccer practice. One kid is disabled and has extra appointments. We also run multiple businesses. The car she was driving that was ""out of gas"" was purchased to rent through car sharing websites and I really prefer she not drive it, but she likes to drive it because its brand new and her car is very old (though not nearly as old as the car she had when we got together which is now my car.) We have two other businesses, and we have some left over work from a pet sitting business we just sold.

The car with the flat tire just needs to be aired up.

Also, turns out that the new car had plenty of gas and the ""gas light"" was actually some other kind of service light.

This is very stressful and I was late to work. I don't want to piss her off, but I really want to say, ""Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part."" I'm afraid if I say that, it will make her think I don't want to help her. I do want to help her, but I don't like just being blindsided by endless random requests that are demanded hatefully.

I have no idea how to react.",cptgreatcpt,198,39,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ik5m5/my_best_friends_wife_told_me_she_loves_me_and/,"I'll try to keep this brief and only include important info. First off the primary details. I'm 23/m, my friend is 24/m, his wife is 21/f. I've know him since I was 5 and they have been married for almost 4 years. I've only gotten to really know her in the last 8 months or so.

A week ago I went to a bar with the two of them and around 12 my friend had to go home so it was just me and his wife. We decided to go dancing which started out innocent enough. But after a few drinks she starts getting pretty dirty. She could tell I was uncomfortable so reassured me that my friend was ok with it. An hour later of sweaty grinding the bars close. 

So we walk back to my car, I'm sober she's drunk. She stops me before we get in and starts asking me what I think of her. I say the same things that every guy would tell a girl married to his best friend, trying not to make things weird as it was obvious she wanted to get some love confession out of me. She then goes on and on about how much she loves me, how if she wasn't married she would have sex with me. How she wishes she could just marry both of us. She kept saying that she loved me but she still loved my best friend too, just in a different way. I lay awake in bed all night just repeating ""fuck"" in my head over and over again.

The next day she calls me and asks to meet up to talk about everything. This is when things get mind-blowing in my opinion. She talked to my friend about how she felt and supposedly, ""he was ok with it."" He understood that she has needs, and as long as there are boundaries he's fine. She doesn't want to have an affair but she wants to develop a relationship with me that would be ""very loving and super close."" We wouldn't be able to have sex but we could cuddle and hold hands. She said she would have to see me at least once a week. She even suggested I move in with them so that I could see her everyday.

I asked what exactly the relationship would be seeing as how we couldn't be physical, our development would be seriously limited and I could never marry her. She says, ""I wouldn't rule that out."" She thinks that in the future somehow we will be able to have some kind of three way marriage were we all have sex and live together like a hippie commune or something.

I tell her I have to think about it. Really my mind is just full of fuck. She seemed shocked that I didn't just jump right in. She said she wasn't expecting me to hesitate the way I did. I can't honestly believe she proposed this to me.

Seriously what on earth am I supposed to do? I should say that although I'm physically attracted and (not so much anymore) emotionally attracted to her I have no interest at all in this proposal. I have yet to talk to my friend about it. I feel like she's requesting the most selfish type of relationship you could have. She gets two guys and expects me to stay close with her in case theres a chance we may get to have sex? Why on earth would I agree to that? The worse part is she genuinely feels like this is a good thing. She would truly feel broken hearted if I said no. In her mind there is nothing unnatural about this and she fully expects that it would work. 

So I guess what I'm asking for is advice on how to say no without ruining my friendship and without creating drama. Also any general opinions or thoughts would be appreciated. I hope this is all coherent and it doesn't sound like I'm rambling. I'm still trying to sort it all out and I'm not the greatest writer out there.

Edit-----------------------------------

 Ok so i figured I would do a follow up for those interested. I talked to my friend alone and told him I felt weird about it and that she mentioned long term wanting to get more physical i.e. sex. turns out she didnt mention that part. He seems to be in a bit of a denial state. Saying things like well I don't think she would ever do that.  He was ok with cuddling and danceing stuff but thats about it. He knows she can be a little crazy, but like I said previously he's not the divorce type.

Later I talked to her. Or I should say tried. It felt like I was talking to a brick wall. I told her I wasnt comftorable with the situation and that I just wanted things to be the way they are. I didn't want to be alone with her and I couldn't dance with her anymore. I figured I would try to resolve it without just cutting her off. She kept trying to convince me to just give it a try. Saying my friend was ok with etc etc. we talked im circles for about 10 minutes before I realized it was futile to reason. 

So unfortunately im going with option B. It's only been 15 hours since our conversation but im essentially cutting her off. I'm sure ill still see her but only when shes with my friend. shes texted me twice today but I havent answered. Shit sucks, but i'm hopefull things will improve. 

On a related note some people are saying i'm being closed minded in all of this. I have nothing against poly relationships. But she chose to marry into a monogamous one and I don't think my friends is ok the fact she now wants to change. She is also not telling my friend the whole truth. 

So there you have it. Sorry for typos and bad format im on my  phone and im lazy.

So, I can't believe it, but she left! Last Saturday I went to her house, along with about 12 other people, and we helped her move all of her things out along with my little brothers and sisters things. She's moving in to a house about 30 minutes away from me, and she can't be happier. She told him if he made the effort to work on things she would give him another shot. He hasn't and she is actually relieved. At first she was really emotional about the whole thing... Saying how she didn't know if she could do it. But I kept telling her as soon as she had her freedom she would wonder why she stayed so long, and I was right.    

Since then some people have confessed that the only reason they didn't tell her about the affair was because he was telling everyone that they had an open relationship. She's really embarrassed, because that's not her.    

The other girl has been calling my mom and saying how that's her bar now and how much she loves him. Most times she's drunk and my mom has stopped answering, because all she does is scream almost incomprehensible obscenities.    

The worst thing that came out of this though, which KILLS ME, is that he gave my mom an STD... one of which has no cure, but I won't say which one because I feel bad for her.. she also contracted an STI from him as well, which is being treated right now.   

I'm happy to say this is a new beginning for our family and I'm happy to never have to see or hear from him again. She's over him and over his sociopathic tendencies.

1297743769.0,164,self.relationship_advice,flm1q,What's worse than being Forever Alone on V-Day? Let me tell you.,worsethanalone,206,42,196,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/flm1q/whats_worse_than_being_forever_alone_on_vday_let/,"TL;DR up front - married for 8 years, I do everything but wife treats me like a doormat and didn't get me anything for V-day but a free e-card, then went to sleep. I'm so done.

Background: we've been married for 8 years. We have 2 kids. The past 3 years have been incredibly trying for me. 

In this time, she has completely ceased doing anything that even acknowledges me as her spouse unless it's to her benefit. Last anniversary, I searched around and spent about $250 on a creative gift that was useful and met the 'traditional' anniversary gift definition. She got *nothing* for me. Last V-day, I stayed up late making a crafty valentine which she ended up tossing aside and which got buried under a pile of papers and junk mail on the desk. For my birthday, we went out to a restaurant and she told me that she ""thought"" about getting me an iPad, but then changed her mind. Gee, thanks for the ""thought"" about getting a gift with our money.

In addition, she only participates minimally in housework, claiming that ""she doesn't have any time"" while making only minimal, token attempts every 2-3 weeks or so. I take care of all of my own laundry and the kids laundry, sweep the floors, mop, and general pick-up. Her dirty clothes cover various areas of our bedroom and closet. I used to wash and put away her clothes too, but she insisted that I wasn't doing it right and was causing spots or other problems with the clothes, so I stopped doing anything with them.

No sex in 11 months. 1 year is closing in. This isn't due to any great betrayal or insensitivity on my part. I'm an affectionate person at heart, always have been the one to initiate affection in the past. 

Somewhere about 1 1/2 to 2 years ago, she started behaving like a cold fish. Whenever I tried to put my arms around her or plant a kiss on her, she would respond coldly like it was completely unwanted. Eventually there was an event around June-July of last year where I tried to put my arms around her and she just looked at me and shook her head and backed up. She rejected my hug, and from that point forward there has been almost no physical contact whatsoever.

 I have to keep reminding myself that 'this is not normal' because nobody else in the world has to put up with this kind of treatment to be in a relationship. My memories of all the good times we once had are almost repressed - it hurts to think about what once was.

We went to counseling. My opinion on this is complex - I have always felt that the only way for two people to work out an issue is to talk between those two people with mutual respect. I don't think a counsellor is necessary just to talk, but I find she can't be respectful and tends to escalate things unless there's another person in the room. 

Week after week, it seems like we made only the most minimal progress before the 50 minute session was up. Finally, we missed an appointment before Xmas, and I haven't had a chance to call the counsellor to reschedule - he has no office staff and works by voicemails, so it is a pain to call and schedule a time with him, and she won't take the initiative to do it for us.

She gave me a card for Xmas which gave me the slightest hope that she actually cared about me. We had a dramatic conversation a few weeks ago where I sent the kids over to the grandparents house for the night, took her out to dinner and told her we needed to talk, basically said that she needed to show me in words and actions that she had some commitment to me before we go any further. It was a long and complex night, a lot of emotions from the past came out, and after a long emotional battle she finally told me that she was willing to try to fix things with me, but it was going to take 'baby steps'.

I tried to make some of those baby steps for V-day by doing the right thing - I ran out Sunday night and got a dozen roses, and took the time to pick out a card that had a sentiment I could agree with. We don't have much money to go around and I certainly don't have much time either, so this is the best I could do. 

I put the roses in a crystal vase we already had, cleaned off the kitchen counter and left them where she would find them with the card. A small gesture. She usually gets up before me in the morning.

I woke in the morning - to nothing. No happy V-day said, no hug, no kiss, no thank you for the flowers. I helped to get the kids ready and out the door, she said goodbye and left. I never really expected her to plan ahead, but I thought at least she would use her time during the day to try to do something to show me I still mattered to her.

When I finally got home - nothing. The only thing she 'got' me was a free ecard that she sent to my work email at the end of the day just before 7pm when I was on my way home. No greeting, no hello, not even served dinner. I took pizza from a box and ate it in front of the stove because she wouldn't even bother to clear a spot for me at the table. Finally she says ""do you want to come join us?"" ""No room"" I say. ""OK, I'll get up."" She gets up and lets me take the seat to finish my last few bites of pizza, rather than cleaning off the table and being hospitable to me in the first place.

I eat and I clean up, and I continue cleaning up the house and laundry. My heart just hurts. Part of me is wondering if maybe she has some surprise that she's planning on bringing out for me, but my body is dragging and my head is just spinning with the thought that she actually didn't care enough to do anymore than the e-card.

It's time to put the kids in bed, she disappears and goes to the bathroom for 10 minutes. Finally she says ""Daddy's going to help you brush your teeth and put you in bed,"" dishing the task off to me. As I am busy going back and forth taking care of the kids she starts asking me ""Is everything OK?"" 

I've been through this 1,000 times before and I'm not taking the bait for this trap. If I tell her what's bothering me, she'll just use it as an opportunity to grandstand about how *busy* she is, and how she just doesn't have the time to do anything for me for V-day, and how *dare* I criticize her for that. This is one of her little defense techniques, turning around whatever hurt she's caused through her actions and pretending like she's the one who needs an apology.

I say ""No, I'm fine."" She says ""well I kind of feel like you're being short with me."" I say ""I'm not being *anything* with you."" ""Oooh-kay"" she says dramatically.

She basically headed straight for bed while I put the kids on bed. Lights out and straight to sleep for her. I put the kids to bed, kiss them goodnight and I am alone.

My heart hurts like you wouldn't believe. I have been through so much and I haven't gotten anything out of this relationship in *years*. She said she would take baby steps, but she hasn't done anything. I feel used, because logically I expect that if she doesn't want to actually have a *relationship*, she should just choose divorce - move on, make both of us happier. But she seems intent on using me for all I'm worth, while extending nothing to me in terms of benefit from this relationship. 

I have supported her in everything she has done - in the past 5 years I supported the whole family while she went back to school and started a new career, was proud of her when she graduated with honors. In that same time I have had my own great accomplishments which she responded to only with ""good for you.""

There's more that has happened in the past 3 years but I can hardly sum it up. I'm just totally broken by the V-day experience. Our anniversary is coming up and I am wondering if it is even worth bothering to get an anniversary gift.

Sorry if this is rambling, frankly I don't even give a shit if anyone can give me advice. She once meant everything to me, I asked her to marry me, and now she can't even be bothered to show me the slightest affection. WTF am I missing?

He knows about what happened when I was little. I got drunk and blabbed some details about it a few times. He convinced me we should recreate it to help me get over it. Even the really bad parts. Sometimes he uses it to punish me when I'm bad.
And he's controlling. Really controlling. I have to ask permission to go to the bathroom. I get punished when I forget.
Its bad and I don't know why I'm so okay with it.""

And in answer to how he punishes her, 
&gt;""Belts &amp; cigarettes. The same ways I was punished when i was younger.""

My sister was sexually abused pretty badly when she was a child and now this jackass is making her relive it all again. I want to destroy the bastard but I can't even convince her that none of this is the least bit healthy.

I want to drive the four hours to her place, throw her in the car and hit her bastard boyfriend on our way back to our parents place. It makes me sick that my little sister is being victimized again.

My boyfriend thinks I'm overreacting and need to calm down, but admitted he'd be just as upset if it were his sister. 

She told me these things in confidence but I think our parents need to be told. ANything to get her out of there. 

Am I wrong about any of this?

UPDATE: I drove out there. Now I'm sitting in McDonalds surfing reddit and waiting for her boyfriend to leave for work. I've calmed down some, I've no intention of confronting her boyfriend at all.

To this I say: 
 
Whatever. 

For those who connected in some way with that post, and want to get something constructive out of it, I offer you this:

Everyone's standards are impossibly high. From the slightly-uptight manager at your local bookstore, to the overweight girl who you see at the bus stop near work.  Believe it or not .. these people have high standards and ideals of what they're looking for, just like you. I know it may make you gag a little to think that, but it's true. 

Everyone's standards are high. 

And, if left to a paper-and-pen world, everyone would hold out to the end of their days for the right Jack or Jane. It's so simple on paper, right? If (potentialMate &lt; my.ideal) MoveOn(); 

Except we don't live our life in a paper and pen world. 

When (and if) you step out into the real world, and take a chance, you discover the most amazing things. You discover that: 

+ Wow, a girl who is not your perfect 10 can still hold your attention all night! 
+  A guy who looks like a douche on the surface can actually be charming and be quite geeky! 
+ Hey, that girl who doesn't subscribe to my tofu-of-the-month club is still pretty hip to food , and is making me tingle in my nether-region. 
+ Geez, that girl doesn't quite understand the MVC model, but gosh if she isn't making me want to pull her aside and kiss her! 

And perhaps the worst of all: God forbid you meet someone who is *totally not what you were EVER looking for EVER* but goddamnit you can't keep yourself from thinking about them, 24/7. 

You know you've been there. 

**People who aren't your perfect matches can still push your buttons, consume your idle thoughts, get under your skin, and end up being the object that you never thought could be affected.**

The fact of the matter is that **attraction is not an option.**  Create your impossible-to-match perfect-person outline if you want! Use it as a litmus test for dating sites! Feel free to mass-reject people based on how the data lines up. It all works well and good on paper. 

But if you venture into the real world and actually *meet* people, be prepared to have feelings that your litmus test never factored.

I cook, he cleans dishes).  My friend (and fellow redditor) was staying with us for a few days while her SO was out of town on business.  She helped cook most nights, and a couple of other nights she cooked everything without any help from me at all (which was an awesome break for me). 

I saw he wasn't doing the dishes, so I got on him about it.  It's not fair for him to not do his share.  He says nothing at the time, and does the dishes while I take care of our son.  

This is the problem with my DH.  Around other people he is pretty docile.  I've had friends comment about him being an asshole, but few have seen him really angry, as he doesn't really like confrontation (unless it's with me of course).

So last night, I let him know that I need to pay a lawyer 300 dollars so my ticket will get dismissed (long story for another day) and I was letting him know that I might need him to cover food for a week (normally my expense, but my paychecks are not that awesome).  He flips out at me, saying the ticket is my responsibility and he shouldn't have to pay for it, and he starts SCREAMING at me about how I've been nothing but a bitch all week to him about doing the dishes, and about how I don't do fucking anything around here. (I guess cleaning, laundry, childcare, and working full-time is me not doing anything)

I remained calm and told him that I wasn't asking him to pay my ticket, I was just giving him a heads up because that 300 will severely cut into my paycheck, and he might need to cover food for a few days.

He keeps yelling at me and calling me a stupid bitch, and I can only take so fucking much of that.  So I go into his office and take one of his framed comics off the wall and threw it to the ground and said ""There.  That's me being a bitch."" The frame shattered (comic was okay, and he has replacement frames).  

His reaction was as follows: Grabbing me by the throat until I couldn't see and throwing me on the ground.  I got up to defend myself and he put me in a full nelson while I screamed at him to let me go.  When he finally did, I went into the bedroom.  He followed me in there and proceeded to dump my clothes out of the dresser all over the floor.

(Side note: our infant is in the next room wailing while this is happening)

I sat in the bedroom and cried for a few minutes, and then I started to feel bad about the comic, and I sure as shit wasn't going to clean up my clothes.  I went to the office and told him that I would clean up the comic I had broken if he put all my clothes back into the dresser.  He comes back with this:

""Get the fuck out of here, you have lost your privileges to be in this room.""

1) We own this house equally.  In fact, if it wasn't for me putting about 20,000 down on this house, we wouldn't have it.

2) Who the hell is he to tell me where I can and cannot go in my own home?

I remain calm, apologize to him about the comic, and tell him to please go clean up the mess he made.

He comes to the door grabs my arms and throws me into the wall adjacent to the office. I try to go back to the door, but he keeps doing it.  I don't know why I kept going back, I guess I didn't want him to think that hurting me physically got him what he wanted.  

After I fed our son and put him to bed, I took a painkiller and cried myself to sleep.  I woke up this morning to him cuddling me in bed.  

I am so conflicted, and I don't know what to do.  I don't have the money to leave him.  All the money my mom left me when she died went into this house and my Bachelor's degree.  

This is not the first time he has laid hands on me, but this is the first time he kept doing it over and over again, without any physical retaliation from me, besides the pushing and kicking to get away. 

The worst part is he didn't leave bruises.  I'm sore all over, and there are finger marks on my arms where he grabbed me, and I have a lump on my arm from where I hit the wall, but there is nothing concrete enough for me to tell the police.  No one would believe me because I don't have proof.  Sometimes I wish he would break my nose, or give me a black eye, anything that would indicate he had hit me, so I could go to the police and they would take me seriously. 

I don't know what to do reddit.  Please help me.

TL;DR Husband was physical with me during a fight, all while our infant son was in the next room and I don't know what to do. 

EDIT: 22(F) 24(M) together 5 years, married 1

UPDATE: Called local police to tell them what happened.  He came home early from work before they got here.  He told the police that he was restraining me because I was going to damage his property, the cops asked me what had happened, and I told them the whole story, showed them where he grabbed me, the lump (which now has a slight bruise) on my arm, and the finger marks.  Then my husband grabbed the broken frame from the garbage can in the office and told the officers that I threw it AT him.  The officer asked me if I did indeed throw it, and I said yes, but I threw it to the ground, and I didn't threaten him at all.  Since my husband said he was restraining me to prevent me from causing more damage to his property (and himself), and there are no marks on me to suggest otherwise, the police did nothing.  They didn't arrest him, they didn't do ANYTHING.  They wrote stuff down on paper and gave me a business card.  When they left my husband looked at me dead in the face and said something to the effect of ""Now they know you're a crazy bitch too"", then he went into the office.  He told me that if I take my son and leave he will call the police and have them put me away.  I am living a fucking nightmare right now. What do I do? Should I get him angry enough to really hurt me?  I fell like the moment of pain will feel will be worth it so that I can take my son and not be scared anymore.

Four men.  She had an affair with four different men over the past five months.  

The first was a guy from work she start sexting and sending racy pictures to back in october.  Then she met a random guy at a concert and kissed him.  She met up with him again when she was at a drive-in movie theater with a friend, where allegedly nothing happened except cuddling.  She met up with him again when she was at a gay club with some friends, and he fucked her from behind in the bathroom...  He drunk texted her a month later, they fought, and broke off contact after that.

One night in mid december I came home from work at 6pm, knowing that she got done at 2pm for a company christmas party.  Her pet bunny was out of its cage and running around the apartment.  She was nowhere to be found.  Her car was in the parking lot.  Her coat was on a chair.  I called her phone and it rang from the couch.  I called my mom in a panic.  I ran around the apartment complex looking for her.  I screamed her name.  I even checked the goddamn dumpsters, expecting the worst.  When she came home, an hour and a half later, the police were in my living room, and I was giving them her description.  I held her so tightly.  I was so scared that something had happened to her.  I was in tears.  A minute earlier, she was making out with the guy from work, in his car, down the street, with her hand on his dick.  If she wasn't on her period, she would have had sex with him.

Then theres new years eve.  The bassist guy likes it up the ass.  When my wife and her gay friend went up to his hotel room, he asked him to fuck him up the ass.  He did, with my wife in the room, and then the guy told him to get lost.  He then had unprotected sex with her, with possible vaginal insemination.  She took the morning after pill, and had a pregnancy scare when she was late for her period.  They continued to chat via text/email/video chat after that.

Finally, she had an emotional affair with a guy she met on Reddit.  They flirted via text and email, and made plans to meet in person and have sex while I was on a business trip last weekend.  A friend of mine asked her if she wanted to do LSD together, and she found that to be the better option.  As far as I know, she never met the guy.

She continued to flirt and chat with three of the four men up until last wednesday when I found out.  I only found out about the other two yesterday, after I invaded her privacy and found tons of emails and chats with and about these men.  I forwarded those emails to myself.  I even have the t-shirt that my wife slept in that belonged to the bassist.  She actually brought it into our home.

I know this doesn't count as verification, but here is a photo of the [t-shirt]( http://imgur.com/3yD4f), and of my [hospital bracelet]( http://imgur.com/SqeZe) from when I got screened for STD's.

I could never hurt or kill myself.  But believe me when I say I wish I was dead.  I wouldn't wish this pain on someone I hate.  I'm weak.  I'm exhausted.  I can't eat or sleep.  I miss her so bad but I'm repulsed by her at the same time.  I told her not to even be in the same room as me until she gets tested for STDs.  I told her to email her entire family and tell them everything she did.  She has a very tight family and this will likely shame her for life.  I told her she needs to cut all ties with everyone and burn every bridge, including with the two friends she had that enabled her, if she ever wants to speak to me again.  And even then, it's very likely that there's nothing to save.  

I feel so alone.  I have friends that I've been relying on, but I can't tell if they are being supportive because they want to be and they like to have me around, or if they are simply not assholes.  My confidence and self esteem is shot.  I'm doomed to be alone no matter what I do.  I was already physically neglected, I am in no condition for a new relationship, and there is no way I could be intimate with this woman again.  Everything I had was just ripped away.

I need some cheering up.  Again, south jersey/philly area.  Thanks again for the kind words I've been receiving.  

EDIT:  She had sex with the guy from work.  I'm fucking done.  Its over.  I didn't make her write any letters or tell anyone.  She can rot for all I care.  I'm free from this bullshit.  Anyone for a beer?

I don't necessarily agree with the whole direct selling thing, but I will always support my wife no matter what she does.

She planned it out in advance, and was sooooo excited about the whole thing... however about a week before the party, she began to get worried because only one person responded back to her with a 'maybe'.  Well... The day has come, and no one has showed up.  All this morning she spent time cleaning up the living room, setting up her entire display, and buying and making refreshments just in case someone showed... and, no one showed.  I feel so sad for her.  She told me she was going upstairs to take a nap... which is probably true but I can tell she wants her alone time as well.

This is one of those times where I need to say the right thing to her.  This sucks... She put so much ton of time and energy in this event, and now she's really upset.  Reddit...

**EDIT: Reddit, you all are fucking awesome!  Everything is just fine now.  I combined a lot of the advice you all gave, and everything went way better than I expected.  I dashed out to the grocery store and bought a few of her favorite things (thanks peperojascardona!).  Such a simple idea, but I didn't even think about it at the time.  I surprised her with it, and told her how sorry I was that her event didn't go as planned.  She wept pretty hard for a moment as I held her, but I think that actually helped her get the remaining sadness out of her system.... because after that, we started playing with the kids until it as their bedtime.  Then we just laughed and joked for the last few hours.  She's upstairs right now learning to create a blog or something.  I'm pretty sure she's still a bit upset, but I know she's feeling a lot better, THANKS TO YOU ALL!!!

Do I stop it or see if she stops herself?,letitgoorno,203,51,231,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bwd59/my_wife_is_planning_an_affair_do_i_stop_it_or_see/,"Background: married 17 years.  Four kids (all 11 and over).  I work 40-55 hours a week.  She stays at home.  She has a part-time on-call job but the phone rarely rings.

My career is in computers and her understanding of computers is limited to browsing, online shopping (alot of online shopping) and email.  As such, she has not effectively covered her tracks at all during this course of events.

She has the standard complaints: She's bored at home. I'm not exciting enough anymore. We never go anywhere.  We never seem to have enough money.  In my defense I'll admit the the responsibility of being the sole financial support for six people (and two dogs) makes me a little more dull than I used to be.  Having to do things like pay for the mortgage, car loans, groceries, utilites and whatnot tend to do that.  I will freely admit that I am quite a bit less reckless than I was in my Harley riding, motocross racing, beer chugging college days (when we dated).  'We never go anywhere' apparently ignores the 2-3 family vacations we take each year.  I suspect she wants to lock the kids in the basement and head to Vegas for a week.  As for the 'never enough money', the disparity in the comparison between our house/lifestyle to her two-income friends never seems to dawn on her.

As I mentioned before, computers are not her strong point so it was obvious to me when she started trolling through craigslist (i.e.: many times she did these things while logged into my account!).  First she was looking at things for sale.  Then she noticed the personals.  I noticed when she started browsing through the local ads then as she expanded her browsing to areas nearby.  This was happening for 5 months or so and didn't seem to be going anywhere.  Then she posted her own add.  A 'w4m' ad under 'casual encounters'.  She didn't set up an anonymous webmail account.  She instead used her actual email address.  It was hard to miss the flood of messages coming in to my mail server sitting out in the garage.  The traffic has died down and now looks as if she's sending regular messages to one guy (about 3-4 times daY).

I'm torn about what to do here.  Part of me wants to step in and stop it (we have four kids dammit!) but to be honest, the other part of me is saying 'fuck it'.  I work. I provide.  She benefits...  but she's still 'not happy'.  Hell...  maybe if she goes through with it I'll be able to keep the kids and house in the divorce.  Apparently all she wants is an 'exciting' boyfriend who's not tied down with those pesky responsibilities.

And since I know it will probably come up:

Sex: Very regular and surprising very good.  5-6 times a week at least and she is multi-orgasmic (no, she's not faking).  That's never been an issue.

Going out: I'm sure someone will ask why I haven't planned our going someplace 'special' with her.  We did before kids.  Alot.  But now I ask....  why hasn't she planned something?  She's the one who's home all day in front of the computer.  Would it kill her to put any effort forth?

So what do you think reddit....  stop it or let it go?

**edit:** Ok reddit, going to be stepping away for a bit.  I was really surprised by the number of responses and there's a lot of good advice in there.  Thanks for that.

Two things I'll add:
 
- I never saw the original add.  I think she deleted it (or someone flagged) when the flood of messages came in.  All I know it the bits and pieces that were copied into some of the email messages (and they were pretty graphic).  The idea of replying to the ad myself is... interesting but now impossible.

- The 'no more excitement' thing is really setting me off.  Mainly because SHE'S the one who wanted me to get rid of the Harley when we started having kids...  because it wasn't safe.  Go figure.

**FINAL EDIT:**  Holy CRAP!  I can't believe the response this received.  Thanks Reddit.  You've been a huge help.

- The Camry never made it home last night.  In its place is an F-150....  with a cycle trailer attached (no cycles though.  yet.)  She came out with a 'what the hell' look when I pulled in.

1371192518.0,155,self.relationship_advice,1gbp4f,We're getting married next year. I can't sit next to her when we eat. May I vent?,QuitSmiling,207,52,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gbp4f/were_getting_married_next_year_i_cant_sit_next_to/,"I'm 41M she is 33F. We've been together for 4 years, living together 3 years, recently engaged. I'm committed, not second-guessing this marriage. She is beautiful, smart, witty. God damnit, she smacks the fuck out of her food. She chews with her mouth open, talks with her mouth full, even talks in the process of swallowing, so you get that nice throaty gurgle voice, it doesn't stop her. She doesn't realize that she is doing it. She eats quickly. She looks at the food the whole time she is eating. If we are watching a movie and we make popcorn, she will miss every scene of the film until the bowl of popcorn is gone, picking up a piece of popcorn, hand to mouth, eyes in bowl, picking up popcorn, hand to mouth, eyes in bowl, forever.


I did not have a strict upbringing, but table manners were a big deal. The reason I don't put ketchup on a piece of grilled chicken anymore is because my mother stopped letting me at around age 9. We were also trained to keep elbows off the table, napkins in lap, etc. As an adult, I'm not offended by most of those offenses. But the smacking...


I might be a little OCD, I do acknowledge that it's my problem—other people don't appear to be disturbed by it, while I literally get sick to my stomach, have to leave the room. In the first 2 years of our relationship, I would often bring it up in the nicest way possible. The only way I know how to do that is the way my mom would tell me: ""Baby, sorry, try to chew with your mouth closed."" She nods in agreement and makes an adorable concerted effort to do so for the rest of the meal. I almost wish she was punk and defensive about it, so I wouldn't feel guilty. Problem is, she needs reminding for every meal. I gave up a while ago because I start feeling like a dickhead dictator. It just won't take. So now, if we sit and watch a show while we eat dinner, I sit at the table while she sits at the couch. ""Sit with me, baby,"" she says. ""Okay, one sec,"" as I wait for us to both finish our dinner. Usually, we'll finish around the same time, but she will go for Seconds. This is the worst because I don't have my own eating to distract me as she enjoys her new heaping plate, then I will do dishes, walk around, etc. Again, I acknowledge that this is largely my problem. But I don't think I'm being a drama queen, I don't think it's my ego. I am severely distracted and disturbed by the way she enjoys her food.

Having eaten with her family a hundred times now, I see where she gets it. Her dad is worse than she is. He actually seems more deliberate about it, smacking the indian yogurt sauce (for example) on his tongue, audibly mixing everything with his saliva, as if he were giving a performance of his opinion of every bite. You can hear him from the next room. It's so bad that I regularly decline her invitations/insistences to have dinner with her folks.

I know to some it may seem extreme to write a wall of text about a simple pet-peeve. This is probably my own issue to resolve. I wish it didn't bother me so much. But the question I always come back to is...

CAN'T SHE JUST FUCKING CHEW WITH HER MOUTH CLOSED????

1371904878.0,150,self.relationship_advice,1guq1s,Do people in a relationship have a responsibility to be / remain attractive to each other?,JoeBiden2016,203,53,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1guq1s/do_people_in_a_relationship_have_a_responsibility/,"First, I know the title here probably raised a lot of hackles and may go against the conventional wisdom, but hear me out.

----

**EDIT:** A few people have posted replies that suggest they think I'm referring to some objective standard of beauty.  I am most definitely not.  ""Remain attractive *to each other*"" means just that.

----

Several years ago, I was involved in a long-term (long-distance) relationship with a girl I loved very much.  At the time, we thought it would move into marriage when we finished our respective degree programs and could be in the same place.

The relationship continued for three years.

At the beginning, I was immensely attracted to her, both physically and mentally.  She's a brilliant person, very intelligent and we had fantastic conversations and fun together.  And she was fit (although not tiny / super skinny) and I was very attracted to her.  Our sex was terrific.

I should add (for full disclosure, given the focus of this post) that I was once a chubby college kid (long before I met her), and because of that, embarked on a fairly serious fitness program.  I was (and am) in good shape when she and I met - reasonable muscle although not overly built, ""athletic,"" I guess - and I generally find people attractive who also take care of themselves.

Over a couple years, my SO gradually began to take less care of herself physically.  Her family tended toward being pretty significantly overweight, and she was headed that way.  I made every effort when we were together to try to find active things for us to do together, but we only saw each other one a week or every two weeks, and it was clear she was not being particularly active when we weren't together.  She began to put on weight.

At first, it didn't bother me, but it continued.  She reached and surpassed my weight and continued.  I began to feel less sexually attracted to her, and that began to affect other things in our relationship.  She knew something was wrong, and even though we still had great mental chemistry, the physical part just wasn't there.

Finally, after hinting at things for months, I just came out and said that I was feeling less attracted to her physically because of her weight.  She took it pretty hard, and rather promptly decided that we needed to break up (which we did).  It wasn't the worst breakup I've ever had, and she recently got married, and I'm very happy for her.

When I told her what I told her, her response was that she would love me no matter if I gained 50 pounds (I'm about 165) or not, and that I should love her regardless of her weight gain.

That seems like kind of an empty promise, frankly, because she *knew* that I feared going back to my heavy days, and that I'm very likely going to continue to exercise regularly and do my best to stay in good condition, both because I knew it was attractive to her, and because it's a part of who I am.

My opinion on the matter is that adult relationships are both sexual and mental, and require chemistry on both levels to be truly successful.  As such, both people in the relationship should recognize that their attractiveness to the other person is important for the health of the relationship, and should have enough respect for their partner to make an effort for that person.

To my mind, it's lazy, selfish, and disrespectful to abdicate any responsibility for one's own appearance by claiming that your partner should love you, regardless.

Now, there are exceptions to this, obviously.  But in a situation in which both partners are reasonably healthy and capable of doing things to remain attractive to the other (which includes staying in shape), I think *both* partners have a responsibility to each other and to the relationship to not become complacent and just assume that whatever happens, the other person will love them regardless.

Am I making any sense here, or do I just come off as a giant dick?  I'd love to hear other peoples' thoughts.

**Note:** This post came after reading a series of posts elsewhere from both women and men complaining that their long-term partner had let him- or herself go.  Somehow, the conventional wisdom seems to be that it's perfectly okay for a woman to tell a man that he is getting heavy and needs to lose weight because he's becoming less attractive to her, but it's not all right for the opposite to occur.

that my wife and partner of 11 years had an 8 
month affair with one of my best friends.  AMA.",blown_apart,206,60,249,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ez3w4/iama_30_year_old_father_who_found_out_a_week_ago/,"This is my first reddit post.  I have been reading reddit for just about two years.  Never in my life did I think that this would be my first submission.  I'm 30, she's 29.

Melanie and I met when we were kids.  Her brother and I were good friends growing up.  I always had a bit of a crush on her, and when we turned 18 we started dating.  It worked exceedingly well - we got along great, had similar interests in the outdoors, and we just really enjoyed each others company.  We moved in together in 2005, bought our first home in 2006, and had our first child (a beautiful smart little boy) in 2007.  Over the course of 10 years, we went from working low end jobs making 8 bucks an hour to both of us having university degrees and making a combined $200K between us.  We grew up together, and this past summer in July we finally got married.  It was a beautiful wedding - small, intimate, and well worth the wait.  We honeymooned in Hawaii while her mom watched our son.  We came back from Hawaii, settled down, and conceived what will be our second child in November.  Reddit, my life wasn't perfect but I had essentially everything I could want and then some.

I found out on the 30th of December that my wife was having an affair with one of my good friends from February until October.  They had sex a half dozen times; they had sex less than 48 hours after we returned from Hawaii.  My wife started pulling away from him immediately after that, but they continued to see each other and be intimate together until late October.  They only had intercourse the once after we were married.  

There are a few factors here that make things worse.  This guy was my hunting partner; we spent a lot of time together.  He planned my bachelor party.  He used things that I trusted him with to get closer to my wife.  He was relentless; I've seen the text messages and had my wife explain to me what happened.  I cheated on her very early in our relationship with a girl.  I immediately told her the very next day and I thought we'd worked through it.  He talked to her at length about it; she cried and opened up to him.  He pressured me like crazy to have a one night stand with one of his friends before I got married.  I didn't, but I can only imagine what he would have done if I had.

Reddit, I always felt before that the key to relationships was independence.  I made sure that my wife wasn't smothered; I trusted her completely, even over my own feeling that something wasn't right.  I always tried to make sure she felt loved - bought her flowers, etc.  I wasn't always home as much as I should have been, but I always thought that after 11 years she would have told me if she was feeling neglected.

I am not a perfect mate by any stretch of the imagination.  I have taken several hunting and fishing trips with my friends.  We stay in nice hotels, eat good food, and really enjoy ourselves.  I have not done the same things with my wife.  Having our son made it very challenging to spend quality time together, and we never made the effort to get past it.

The last 9 days have been so hard I cannot express it.  I had to leave my job for the week because I just wound up crying in the bathroom every hour.  We had an emergency counselling session last week and it helped me a lot.  My wife and I are sharing more, talking more, and loving each other more in that same time than we ever have before.  My emotions are a dizzying roller coaster ride of highs and lows like I've never dreamed of.  My friend's wife is trying to talk to us.  She keeps telling me that my wife and this piece of shit are in love, and that she needs some of my time.  The counsellor recommended that I don't talk to her.  My wife had a full on all out affair - do the details really matter?

I feel like I don't have a real choice in this situation.  She's pregnant with my baby (I am as sure that it's mine as anything, but I can't prove that), and I love my son more than life itself.  I cannot fathom trying to divorce her now, even though a large part of me feels that letting this go isn't doing right by myself.

I have always felt that my wife was closed off to me a little bit, even from the time we started dating.  That feeling is essentially gone now - a large part of me is falling in love with her all over again after 11 years.  We've had mindblowing sex almost every day since she told me.  My wife has said repeatedly that she made some very very bad decisions and felt trapped by him.  It still doesn't excuse what happened at all.  In some ways I feel like my old relationship is gone, and that a new one is developing.

I don't know what I'm asking here.  I don't know why I'm writing this, other than that talking about it with people has been very cathartic.  I would love to hear from people who have been through similar situations.  Has anyone ever been through such deep complete betrayal and come out the other side with a better, closer relationship for it?  Or am I setting myself up to lose several years of my life trying to start something that can't be?

Please help.

1254685573.0,149,self.relationship_advice,9qrmc,Four pieces of information I wish each post in relationship advice had.,,163,14,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9qrmc/four_pieces_of_information_i_wish_each_post_in/,"1. Your two (three?) ages - Advice will be different if you're 50, than if you're 22, than if you're 15.  While any historical information is definitely useful (even preferred), this is a great, easy small piece of information that can help judge what to say.  I know not all 15 year olds act 15, but a large percentage of them do, and knowing that helps me put your situation in persepective

2. Length of relationship/Type - Just went on the first date is a different scenario than one year than what I like to call ""effective marriage"" (living together for 4 years with two dogs, a mortgage, and nightly sex is basically ""married"" regardless of having a certificate).  If two people with three kids are on the rocks and one cheats, patching it up is so much better advice than ""move the fuck on,"" but six months and infidelity is a different story.  Generally actual situational facts matter more than emotions (I know everyone feels so very in love, I do too!  But kids/shared mortgage/years of history mean more than hormones/emotions)

3. Whether you have talked to the person about this problem.  So much of the advice here is ""uhm...just talk to them"" and so either A) talking to them before coming here and telling us what they said or B) explaining why you can't talk to them is a good piece of information to have.  Sometimes you can't talk, and so a large percentage of advice would become nonexistent if you just tell us why.  (Hint right here: if the ""why"" is because you're uncomfortable, everyone is going to tell you to get over it).  Generally talking to a bunch of anonymous people on the web is less effective than talking to your heart's desire; it's crazy what people can work out if they just communicate and commit to finding a solution.

4. What natural assumptions can I not make about your situation.  Assumptions I might make include: You are heterosexual (and by extension your gender, I offer different advice to women than men).  If in a relationship, it is closed/monogomous.  Your ages are roughly the same.  You live in roughly the same geographic area.  If you're 16, you live with your parents, if you are out of college, you don't, etc.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_9qrmc,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9qrmc/four_pieces_of_information_i_wish_each_post_in/,

Well I'd be lying if I said that didn't suck.. not sure which hurts worse, my head or my heart. I did as you all suggested.. and well, now I'm left with a broken heart.. I know I'm better off.. I just wish it didn't hurt this much.

He didn't do quite what I predicted.. instead of making me the bad guy and using her as an excuse.. he pretty much stuck with the excuse of being broke.. which I told him was complete bullshit and there is noway in hell she is his only option.. to which he replied after arguing for a bit.. that he was taking the easy way out. 

He adamantly denied that it had anything at all to do with her and that she would never be home and will be giving him $300 a month.. more arguing about why her blah blah.. went in circles.. he then uses the argument that he hates asking anyone for help more then anything - I say you never once asked me for any kind of help whatsoever and I've been your girlfriend for 2 fucking years yet you turn to your ex - he then asks me if he would have asked me to move in would I have.. fucking seriously?? this is when I can't take anymore.. I gave him back my key to his place, and the one thing I knew would get him the most - his USMC ring and dog tags that he gave me very very early in our relationship - basically his most prized possession.. I then walk out the door.

Unfortunately the one kind of big flaw in my plan was drinking an entire bottle of wine in a very short period of time and not eating. Clearly I couldn't drive.. I sat outside on his porch and cried for a long time, he kept begging me to come in - I kept refusing telling him I am no longer welcome in his house - he says its still my place and that nothing has changed - more crying, he makes me come inside because it's freezing and I was in a t-shirt, I sit on the couch and cry.. trying to sober up.. he tries to comfort me and I push him away - finally I basically said you've clearly already made your choice.. you chose money/her over someone you say you love, but you don't throw love and 2 years away for money.. if you really loved me, this idea never would have crossed your mind.. he swears up and down that he does love me.. I take off the bracelet he gave me last Christmas and set it on the table next to his key and USMC ring and dog tags - I stop talking and eventually leave.

That's it Reddit.. my heart is in pieces. I haven't heard from him today, though I didn't really expect to. 

Thanks to all who gave me advice.. and I'm sorry I don't have a happy ending for you. Your kind words and support gave me the strength I needed to do what I knew I had to.. I just wish he never put me in the position to have to do it.

EDIT:  Just saw this hit the top of r/relationship_advice and this is not a throwaway account.  Feeling pretty dumb right now... SO, if you see this, you should probably sit down.

Great guy, love him to pieces.  Can't get over his big belly hanging over me in the bedroom.  I don't find him attractive anymore and I hate myself for it.  No idea what to do.
When we first hooked up he was working out everyday and well on his way to reaching a healthy weight.  He was beginning to look as fantastic as he is.  A year later, he's gained weight and completely quit exercising.  Tried getting him motivated with booty shots down the hallway to our home gym and working out half-naked blasting his favorite pumped-up tunes to get him in the mood to join me.  Nothin'.  He cries about being out of shape and I don't even know what to say.  I consoled him for months but lately I've found myself ignoring the weekly routine pouts.

Worst part:  I am having crazy difficulties looking at him when we make sexy time.  Doggy-style or me on top with my face smashed into his pillow over his shoulder pretty much rule the roost right now.

Please, somebody help me figure out what to do... I just want to enjoy having sex again.  He can def tell that I'm not interested and it kills me that it hurts him so much.

EDIT:  Guess I should throw this out there... no foreplay, ever.  Def mentioned it.  Def do my part.  He can't make sexy time outside of the bedroom because of his size.  Lately he's given up on trying to be sexy completely and just rolls over onto me around 2am.  That's pretty much what brought me here.

EDIT:  WELP, that sucked.  Tried talking to my guy.  He burst into tears.  I have no idea where we stand, neither does he.  I'm pretty sure I fucked that up.  Started with the ""I love you and I have something to talk to you about..."" went to the ""I hate to see you so unhealthy..."" ended with the ""yeah I'm not as attracted to you as I was when we first met and it's been hard on our relationship....I think you might be depressed..."" blah blah blah
Anyway, he wants to know if I want to be with him and wait out whether or not he'll actually get fit, blamed me for a bunch of stuff, then said he feels like I'm just going to find the next easy-out... etc.  I'm sure you get the point.  Can't thank you ladies and gents enough for talking me through this complicated situation.  Seems like there really was no easy way to talk this through HOWEVER, he did say he liked it better when I made this whole thing out to be about his health and def hated the part about me not being attracted to him and wish I had left that out...  so one point for you guys.

Now I know why and don't know what to do.,help_me_reddit_9,179,28,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gp4xk/so_i_found_out_why_the_girl_friend_zoned_me_for/,"9 months ago I met this beautiful girl.  She was playing pool by herself and I went up and asked her if she wanted to play.  We had a great time and I asked if I could see her again.  She told me from the start we could hang out but she wasn't looking for any kind of relationship.  We met at the same bar for awhile and got to know each other.  She always made it clear she thought  I was great but just wasn't in the mind set for a man.

She was never flirtacious with anyone, and didn't string me along in the friendzone while banging other guys.  I figured with the way she carried herself that she was being honest and just didn't want a romantic relationship.  I didn't care for the first time in my life to have sex with this girl.  I wanted to of course but what an awesome girl. She played pool, rode dirt bikes, was an amazing artist, played golf...She literally does EVERYTHING I do! 

I haven't been pushy to get her to myself but every once in awhile I'd drop a joke or a hint about how I wanted her to be mine alone.  That I thought she was beautiful, perfect, etc.  She could hang more than any of my guy friends could.

Anyhow...Now you know why I have been head over heels for the last 9 months.  The other day I ask her if she wants to meet up for lunch.  I decide I can't help but wonder why she doesn't want to be with ANYONE, especially me since we had such great chemistry.  She even looked at me with those eyes sometimes that told me I know she has gotta feel something more than friends, but she starts looking stressed out and so I drop it.  

Finally she gives it to me.  It all makes sense now. She tells me the reason she can't be with me is that she has herpes.  She tells me everything and its not even her fault.  Her boyfriend cheated on her and gave it to her.  She hadn't been with anyone not even a one night stand in almost 2 years.  Its made her feel ugly and diseased.  She said she couldn't just not tell someone so she chooses to remain alone.

I wanted to cry.  I wanted to hug her and tell her how sorry I was and how she is still an amazing person.  The only words that come out of my mouth though are, ""Oh.""  Then of course she had this blank look on her face waiting for me to say something else and I didn't know what to say. I don't know what to do!  I love this girl, I love her so fucking much.  But I'm only 22.  Herpes is for life.  I haven't really talked to her since she told me and I do NOT want to lose this girl even if its just as friends.

But now I feel like I can't be with her, but then I feel thats not fair either.  Plus I look like an ass for not saying anything when she told me.  I'm so stuck guys. I'm so fucking stuck.  

TL'DR  I meet the perfect girl whose been my friend for the last 9 months, she wasn't friendzoning me...She has herpes and didn't want to bring it up.  

EDIT:  I just texted her and told her ""I'm sorry being kind of cold the other day. It was just a real shocker, but I don't feel any different about you, love ya."" She texted me back, ""I didn't know how you'd react, it could have been worse. Lets go to Vincent's""  (Dirt track) We're gonna go ride bikes in about an hour here.  I think I will continue being her friend and I think I might just talk to her and maybe a doctor about the safest way around all of this.  I'm not in a hurry, I just know that I love this girl a ton.

My wife and I were working on setting a date to go. My dept at work is in the process of hiring new employees cause we lost a few people so I wanted to confirm what date we would have someone to cover me. (2 weeks to find out) While I am waiting my wife sets a date and then tells me her and her friend(girl) are taking the kids on the trip and there is of course no room for me in the car. She didn't even give me the opportunity to request vacation at work. Of course I got mad because that's the only vacation we can afford all year and I'm left out. When I let her know I am mad about it, she acts like I am the bad guy for not saying yea go on the vacation without me this year I would rather be at work.

Am I wrong for being angry about it? I just needed to vent cause I have no one to vent to.


EDIT: I more or less came here to vent. I never had any indication my wife is cheating or leaving me and still don't. I assume a lot of people have been cheated on or divorced in this subreddit due to the ""fuck her"" circlejerk in the comments.

My sister and I are pretty close. I've done various martial arts for 10+ years and my sister recently started Brazillian ju jitsu.

We were at a pool at a friends house yesterday with a small group of people. My girlfriend was sitting on my lap in the shallow end of the pool and my sister sneaks up behind me and puts me in a [rear naked choke](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lEHc2DolfXg/TxpXBu1p2eI/AAAAAAAAAQc/sncdekruQpA/s1600/Daniel+Pineda+Rear+Naked+Chokes+Pat+Schilling+UFC+on+FX+1.gif%20%0A). Afterwards I told her it was a good choke and she mentioned that she can't get a [guillotine](http://www.mmafight.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Wandy-Guillotine-Bisping-2.gif) to work so I explain and show her how to do it and let her choke me. 

Later that night my girlfriend told me that she thought it was creepy that my sister and I were wrestling in the pool. I asked her why since there's nothing sexual about BJJ or pools, and she just said that it was creepy and too close. She said that she wasn't the only one that thought it was weird that I would wrap my legs around my sister. At this point I get frustrated and a little angry about the insinuation. I said that I didn't really care what they thought since that's just how the choke works and maybe they didn't understand that. She kept telling me it was weird and mentioned that her brother [15M] thought it was weird too. I blurted out, ""I don't care what [brother] thinks... he's weird."" That's a little more harsh than necessary, but he's a doofy 15 year old. She's very defensive of her brother so me saying that caused her to leave in a huff, and we haven't talked yet. I'm trying to get in touch with her to talk today.

I don't understand why she thinks it was so creepy and I'm annoyed that she turned me sharing a common interest with my sister into something dirty and weird.

I didn't tell my fiance I know about the other woman, I just broke up with him and told him the wedding is off.

Thanks everyone for your replies. You have helped a lot already. She didn't touch me at all last night while sleeping and isn't talking to me this morning.

Update

I told her on the way to work how much it hurt to read in her texts how she ""wants him to hold her"" I asked her how he would feel if he read in his wives texts the exact same things they tell each other. Her response was ""He wouldn't read his wives texts"" 
I know it was wrong of me to read her text messages,but I would never have felt I had to if I didn't feel she was hiding something important from me.

*************
I seem to have caused some confusion. I do apologise for not getting the whole story out originally.
I knew she was texting this guy a lot for a while now , hard to hide all that typing on your phone all day and night. I wasn't aware of what was being said until yesterday. I had my suspicions from her being sneaky about the texting, turning off her phone when she saw me looking at her, I knew they were friends, close friends. she had told me that much.   
***************
***************


OK, I did text this guy and ask him if he would be OK with another man texting the exact same things to his wife over and over again. After a while he texted me back saying I don't have to worry about it anymore he was through with my wife,that it wasn't worth the hassle.
She then came over,we work in the same place different departments, and said in a smart assed tone, ""Well, I'm all yours now""
What happens next, I don't know. 
************
************
I guess I keep updating this thread and not make a new one. If that is wrong someone please let me know I'm still new here.
Lunch was an ocean of silence except for right before we got back to work.
She told me she loved me then said she was going to need some time to work through her feelings and that I needed to remember that I was the reason this friendship ended.

So here's the deal. To put things simply, I'm the gay friend (minus the gay) for about 6 different girls. This frustrates me to no end. I don't mind being there for them and helping out, but I've reached a personal breaking point. I have plenty of female friends, I hang out with girls all the time, I just never get to the relationship phase ever or get any action. I'm not hideously ugly, I have good social skills hindered by a dark sense of humor (that I've been working on toning down), and I like to think I'm a pretty nice guy (most people I know will agree). I apologize for textually stroking myself there, but my main point is I'm your typical nice guy- not an introvert in a black trenchcoat.  

Can anyone please provide advice on women-ing?

tl;dr: It's a paragraph, just read it.

She was fun to hang out with for a few months and we had some great times together, but she has been emotionally abusing me for the last 2 months. I caught her talking to her abusive ex about 2 months back (he left her with a permanent back injury and she said she hadn't talked to him since they broke up 4 years ago). I tried to break it off with her the second I found out and she said if I left (I was at her place) she would kill herself and it would be my fault. She said she has nobody but me and I left she would kill herself. I told her what's the point? There is no trust in this relationship, and that's what relationships are based off of. She said she didn't care and that she will do anything to not lose me. I foolishly forgave her because I don't want anyone to die on my account (she has tried to kill herself before). She saw my forgiveness as me being a doormat and things have gotten worse since then (truth be told, it did let her know that I was a doormat, and it really affected my self worth - I am still affected by this).

I caught her a few hours ago leaving her house with her laptop, dressed to the nines and get in some dudes car. Obviously she is staying the night and sleeping with this guy. I called her shortly thereafter and she said she was tired and was probably just going to bed. I said ok and hung up.

I know all of the warning signs were there, but I tried to ignore them because she was attractive and I told myself that I couldn't do any better. As a result, I'm in the situation I'm in right now: low self image, down in the dumps, etc. I know I shouldn't be surprised, but it did hurt seeing her get in that guy's car.

She doesn't know it yet because she is having a good time right now and not calling me, but I have taken all of the necessary steps to go with the ""indifference"" method of breaking up (as per the top comment in the Theo/caught her cheating thread).
-I blocked her from sending me text messages, from facebook, and from my email
-I changed her contact name in my phone to ""DO NOT ANSWER"" and I also changed her ringtone to a quiet noise.
-I have 2 months left on my lease and I am moving out this week because she is friends with my room mate and his girlfriend who is often here.

I am excited about doing this because I am looking forward to having my life back, getting my confidence back, and getting back into the game to give it another shot with someone else. I'm not going to lie, I'm going to be 28 and this was my first relationship, so this is not easy for me, but I am trying to chalk this up to life experience and move on.

I know it is going to be hard for me to do this, and I am just trying to keep my mind occupied right now, but I think this is the best thing for me. To any Redditors out there going through something similar, please try to stay positive and keep your mind occupied as I have.

As for why I am posting this, it is kind of therapeutic for me, and, well RA, anything that you can tell me, comments, thoughts in general to help me through what I'm sure is going to be a rough few days (hopefully that's all), I'd really appreciate it. Thanks for reading.

Edit: Thanks for all the kind words everyone. This is helping me so much, I really appreciate it. I am heading to bed now but will be back tomorrow morning sometime. Let me know if this is interesting enough to post updates about.

2nd Edit: Last night was tough, like I knew it would be. I ended up staying up til 4 and having a few beers, and I felt surprisingly good. I'm trying to view this as a weight being lifted off my shoulder rather than ""losing my love,"" because really she never cared about me and it's not that tragic. That said, it is still hard for me. 

She has already started with the phone calls. I have 5 missed calls and 2 voicemails that I haven't listened to (I don't want to but honestly I will probably end up listening to them). I only imagine the calls are going to get more frequent as the day goes on. If things get outrageous with her trying to contact me, I am considering sending a text that says ""take a hint, party girl."" And that being my last contact. That will really sting her and let her know that I know, but I am trying to convince myself that she isn't even worth that. Really, I know she isn't worth that, I just have to stick to my guns. Today is going to be difficult, I'll be popping in and out of here all day, but please, continue to respond. It has been so helpful to me. Give me a verbal kick in the ass if what I just wrote sounds like a bad idea. I have to keep my eyes on the prize here. Thanks everyone!!


UPDATE: 3:50PM EST

OK it's getting interesting over here. This is so hard to do and I don't know why! Please continue to leave me encouraging comments, I am reading every single one and each one is giving me more and more encouragement and helping me through this tough time! I can't thank you enough!

I did check the messages. The first one said ""I want my boyfriend and I want him now"" (trying to be cute). second one a few minutes later said ""wake up! I want you to come over and fuck me!"" It should be noted that I ""ignored"" her calls this morning, so she knew I was in reach of the phone but consciously choosing to ignore them, hence the 5 calls.

She called again at around 12:30, I let that ring and go to voicemail. she didn't leave a message. She called again at 2:30. I ignored that call. I checked the voicemail and it said ""ok now I'm starting to get worried, please call me, this is not a nice thing to do to me.""

I told my parents about this last night as she has their email and home phone and said I don't want them communicating with her. They understood completely. I stopped in a few minutes ago and they said they received a long email from her, but that they didn't read it and deleted it right away. I then showed them how to add her email to the spam filter, so they're all set.

She also called and left a message (I left my parents her # so they know not to pick up) and it was nonchalant about what she should do about a family event that is coming up in a few weeks, asking what she should bring. Obviously this was an attempt at getting some sort of contact with someone in my life, and she is now starting to get the hint. She just sent an email to my second account saying she was worried and that I should call her.

Please give me your comments on this update. Every one has helped me out so far and encouranged me to stay strong. I was driving and my head started racing and I was very close to texting her goodbye, but instead I changed her ID to ""CHEATER AND ABUSER"" and when she called it really helped me out. Immature, I know, but I need every bit of help I can get right now. Thanks in advance guys, every one of you rocks my socks!

UPDATE 2:45 AM

She called about 4 more times since I last posted. Left 3 messages. First one said ""ok I am officially worried. call me. please. love you."" Second one ""please just let me know you're ok, you don't do this. please."" Third one (at about 6pm) ""I don't know if you're mad at me because I was short with you last night, I'm sorry. You never do this. Please call me before you go into work tonight and let me know you're ok. I am supposed to go out for a little bit tonight and I'm supposed to be ready in a half hour, but I'm not because I'm calling you. please call me.""

I then got 2 more calls around the same time from two numbers I didn't recognize. I didn't answer either. Neither left a message. That was the last contact attempt she made (probably 6:30ish, not really sure). She is probably out partying again tonight. Either way, it's not my business.

I worked tonight and kind of had fits all night of wanting to tell her off so bad. These moments usually take a good half hour or so to pass. I just try to stay occupied and have a good time. I am exhausted, going to bed, will continue to give updates tomorrow sometime.

UPDATE 12:38PM

OK I just had a close call. I am signing up for a craigslist account because I need someone to help me move. Apparently you have to verify your account by phone, so I signed up for them to call me and I got a call a few seconds later from an unknown id. I picked up but didn't say a word. Sure enough it was her. She called back a few seconds later without blocking her id and I didn't pick up.

I expected us to get over this obstacle after some time and get back together; and so, I came back from college, after about 1 month of really being apart (over Christmas break), and we meet a couple times, and end up spending time together, and hooking up, to points where it ended in her saying she still loves me, wants to be with me, etc. but saying she can't because she knows it wouldn't work.

She went on a break, didn't explain to me anything. Later we talked and she told me she felt limited, that people started to see her as the relationship instead of her and other things. So after two weeks we worked it out eventually, she came back. I asked her for no more surprises and she said ok. Then she tells me she made out with a buddy twice, nothing more. It hurt me that she moved on so quick in only a week,  but i was getting over it but the hardest thing for me was how i could trust her after she lied to me. So i got over that eventually, then i talk to her later and she tells me about the threesome/sex and doing more with that other guy. This all happened over the span of 3 weeks.

I'm just lost. I have no idea where this came from, our relationship was fantastic before all of this happened. I feel like an idiot for not seeing this sooner or something, i have no idea. I feel like i must be an idiot, but i know i'm not there's just something wrong. Not only did she have a threesome but with my friends (im in highschool) who i was going to for advice and help, and they continued to give me advice and offer their support i assume after this happened (chronologically to me it doesn't make sense otherwise). I have two friends in my school that i know i can count on and i have been, but lately i just feel as if i've isolated myself too far from my other friends, and that i have no one else i can trust. I have these trust issues now that i don't understand. 

She was my best friend, and at times i feel like i just need my best friend back for someone to lean on, i don't have so many others i can rely on. I don't understand how any of them could treat me like that, i hate all my 4 former friends for taking advantage of my situation and her for falling into them but maybe she was confused... Then sometimes i feel like i just want to leave it all behind and move on. Yet when i try, i just want friends to lean on, and i just want my best friend back. I can't focus on any of my overloaded workload either because i keep thinking about them with her, and somehow i need to get it done. 

I know this sounds a little rantish and i'm honestly embarrassed what this situation has turned me into. But please, help me look at this situation, did she hurt me too much for me to be able to be able to look at myself as anyone if i somehow let her back?

1269254308.0,145,self.relationship_advice,bgja1,UPDATES: I cheated... but at what point do I deserve happiness? ,iamabigjerk,179,34,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bgja1/updates_i_cheated_but_at_what_point_do_i_deserve/,"Orginal Post: [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/be1dw/i_cheated_but_at_what_point_do_i_deserve_happiness/)

Original post TLDR; I cheated and got caught, admitted my mistakes and worked very hard on myself and my marriage for 2 years while nearly on house arrest from the wife. However it has not improved and I was getting discouraged. 

First let me say thank you to everyone who commented. I read all of them and they helped me more than I can ever say. Thank you, reddit. 

What a difference a week makes. I came to reddit a mere 5 days ago, and the life I had last week is nearly unrecognizable from the one I have today. **Wall of text ahead.**

After reading all the comments last week, I decided I'm not a prisoner and things had to change. I made plans to go out with friends I hadn't seen in over a year on Friday night. On Thursday night I sat down with my wife to try to re-open communication. Let her know that I have needs and wants that aren't being met, and that if we are going to make this work then some changes have to happen. She is my partner, not my warden. She took it pretty well, and seemed to understand where I was coming from and recognized the huge amount of work ive put into myself and this relationship. It felt like a fairly major breakthrough. We even discussed picking a new therapist and giving that another try. 

But there was something nagging me the whole time. A redditor said to me that he went through something similar, but eventually found out his wife was also cheating. Which explained the Alcatraz style lock down on his life. I don't know why but I couldn't shake this thought. I know my wife wouldn't cheat but she's also a reasonable person, so why the hell have I been on house arrest for 2 years. 

After a couple days, the thought got the better of me and I put a keylogger on our laptop. I did this Thursday afternoon. 

Friday comes and I am excited to see my buddies. We talked a little before I left, she was apprehensive but understood this is necessary to rebuild lasting trust in our relationship. And like Reddit suggested, I hardly had anything to drink, answered txts and phone class in a timely fashion and got home 20 min before I said I would as a show of good faith. My wife is in bed already but sleepily asks how the night went and I said it was great. 

Saturday morning we discuss it at length. She seems genuinely happy and understanding, and I am beaming ear to ear. Not only did I get to see the buddies, but it appears that I'm making headway in my relationship. Win-win. And while I'm on this euphoric high, I decide that trust is not made with a key logger. It was dumb to install it, and will only create paranoia in me. I should also mention that while she has full access to my email, I have the same access to her email and facebook. So really it seemed that a key logger was overkill. I go to uninstall it.

Of course curiosity gets the best of me and I check the very limited 2.5 days worth of logs. Nothing jumps out at me; amazon, facebook, youtube, gmail, etc. I get to the end of the log and it's looking good. Until I see another trip to gmail, this time for an account I have never seen before. I remain calm, I keep an old hotmail account for spam/sign-up crap. I've advised her to do the same and only let friends know her real email. 

Either way, I log into the new account. No spam. No nothing, its empty. Just a bunch of empty folders. Until I hit the ""tax information"" folder. 

Now this folder is full. Full as in hundreds of emails. However none of it is tax related. All of it is to or from ""Steve"". I have a 65yo  step-uncle named Steve, but this is not him. I dont know who this Steve is. These emails are graphic. Lots of what he likes to do to her and what she wants likes to do to him. Lots of ""last weekend was amazing"" type stuff. So after reading maybe 30 of these, I decide I need to stop reading them. 

I made a new gmail account, and forwarded all of them to this account. Then I went back and deleted my tracks. I'm somewhat calm during all this. It sucks, but i cheated so I am now experiencing what she did when she found out about me. While forwarding them, I pay closer attention to the dates. This affair has been going on for a very long time. All the way back to roughly a year before my son was born. (or 1.5 years before I cheated). That hits me like a ton of bricks. What if my son isn't mine? What if my 1yr old baby girl isn't mine? I fucking lose it. I verify my tracks are covered and bolt out of the house saying I'm going to the gym. I sit in my car for 2 hours crying at the thought they might not be mine and how do I ever move forward. I have no idea how to confront her. 

I head home and find her best friend is there. They have decided they want to go a movie. Im still in shock, so I just nod. I need time to process anyways. So I put the kids to bed and try to figure out how I'm going to talk to her about this. I decide to check her secret gmail again. She emailed him 4 hours earlier. She told him she'd have an hour after the movie to meet up. Check the time, the movie is done or close to it. I start calling her cell, repeatedly. No answer. I call about 10 times, no answer. 

It's 1am and I'm sitting on the couch and she walks in. Surprised to see me up, asks if im feeling ok. HA! I stood up right in front of her and said I'm fine. And ask her ""Why didn't you pick up the phone?"", she says it was a movie, cant talk in a movie. And then she forgot to check it when she headed to the 'bar' for one drink. She makes her way to the stairs and I say ""How is Steve doing?"". Her face goes white. ""Uh, your uncle Steve?"" she says. ""No, the Steve you just got done fucking 20 minutes ago. How is he?"" I say. She says nothing. I tell her I found the gmail account. I saw her email planning to met him after the movie tonight. With what little composure I had left, I asked ""Why didn't you come clean when you found about me cheating? We could have fixed this together."". She starts bawling and runs upstairs. 

I follow. What ensues is the worst 4 hours of my life. She comes clean that she met him back when she was working, he was a temp. I again asked why not come clean 2 years ago so we could both work on this. She says she was too hurt by what I did and too ashmed to come clean. She said she told Steve she needed it to end and wanted to work on our marriage. And she says she did, but about 8 months later ended up hooking up again and it started all over. I asked why the prison rules. She says its because she loves me and didn't want me to leave. I explain that, while not right, I cheated because we didnt have sex. But obviously she was having sex elsewhere, so she didnt need it at home. So I asked why she cheated, because I know prior to ""Steve"" we had sex 2-3 times a week, and she came 1-2 times each time. She says he was relentless in pursuing her which made her feel sexy, and that the relationship was taboo, which added a thrill. ""Do you love him?"" to which she says no, but liked the thrill and the taboo.  I could go on and on, I asked a million questions. Eventually I ask the big question, are the 2 youngest kids mine. She assures me they are. I ask how can she be so sure, to which her response is she just knows. Despite what she says she has no way, without a blood test, to assure me they are mine. I am crushed on so many levels. 

I stand up, and head for the door. She stops me and begs me to forgive her and that we will work this out. I can impose harsh rules if i want, and watch her every move and she will do anything to fix this. I calmly tell her I have no interest in being a warden, and that I need to go for a walk. 

I walk for an hour and come home and crash on the couch. Sunday was beyond ackward, I said very little to her. I studied my two youngest, trying to find my traits in them. Everytime i think id see something, Id be struck by the fact that I dont know what Steve looks like. Perhaps he has big ears too, and that's where my son gets them. 

We talked briefly Sunday night. Despite wanting to ask more and understand more, my soul just wasn't in it. So we went to bed separately and I laid awake to the sound of her crying upstairs. 

It felt good to get that out. Im not sure what to do from here. Part of me thinks that neither of us will likely ever trust the other. But the other part thinks that she could have left 2 years ago to either be alone or be with Steve. She gave me another chance, and Im a better person for having that chance. Wouldn't it be hypocritical of me to end this because of infidelity? Doesn't she deserve a chance to prove herself, and improve herself like I have?

UPDATE: I got home from work and she had the kids at her parents for a sleep over. She kept trying to get me to say what I thought or felt, and I kept pretty quit. I told her I didnt know what I thought or felt yet. I know I need to talk to her, but all I feel like doing is laying on the couch withs some beer and watching Futurama till I pass out. 

She did eventually get me to talk. I basically said that I don't know what to do, but I think at the very least we need some separation and therapy if we are going to attempt to fix this. She was unhappy about the separation part, but I put my foot down. Ive lived trapped in my house for two years, perhaps Im not the person she loves but instead loves the idea of ""us"". She saw my point and said she did love me but understood that some time apart might help.

1260512751.0,143,self.relationship_advice,adgy3,Why men are 'pimps' and women are 'sluts' - an explanation.,throway,204,61,171,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adgy3/why_men_are_pimps_and_women_are_sluts_an/,"No, this isn't any stupid joke about master keys and shitty locks.   This is the real deal, prompted by the recent thread by some girl who was shocked (*shocked!*) by her boyfriend being distant after finding out that she'd slept with 50 guys in the span of 3 months.  [link here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ad3om/2_years_ago_i_slept_with_over_50_men_and_my/)

Anyways, a lot of the comments were to the effect of ""why is there a double standard zomg"" and other fairly standard timeless questions.  As someone who pretty much is an expert only in relationships and sexual subjects, allow me to explain:

Men are easy.  Men are always easy.  It is not hard for a woman to have sex with 50 men in the span of 3 months.  Hell, an average-looking woman could probably knock off three or four guys in a single night if she put her mind to it.

By contrast, it's hard for men to have sex.  Men would *love* to have sex with three women in one night, but **it's hard to do**.  That's where the term ""easy"" comes from - a woman is ""easy"" when having sex with her is (relatively) not a *difficult* proposition.  So, a guy who lays 50 women in 3 months is a ""pimp"", because he is doing something challenging.  A woman who has sex with 50 men in 3 months isn't necessarily more sexually appealing, just more willing to have sex.

Now, the complaint that stems from this is a favorite of Redditors -- that somehow 'society' has invented this system to keep women down, to oppress women, etc.

This is bullshit.  Some evolutionary psychology is helpful here: men want to impregnate as many women as possible.  This mentality is evolutionarily desirable and thus has been selected for over millions of years, in the males of many many species.  By contrast, human women can only be impregnated by one man at a time (and there are similar limits in other species).   Therefore, she must be picky.  After all, if she mates with just any old man, her offspring will be less likely to survive, and her genes will be less likely to be passed on.  Thus, she picks the most fit male to mate with.

Let me repeat: **For men, being promiscuous has been selected for evolutionarily.  For women, being selective has been evolutionarily selected for.**

But to top it off, men have evolved to prefer selective women.  First, if a woman is having sex with many men, her pregnancy might not be *his* offspring.  When he invests resources into feeding the child, he'd better be sure it's his.  Second, if a woman is having sex indiscriminately, her female children will also be more likely to have sex indiscriminately, which will ultimately negatively affect his own genes' survival.

It gets even worse though!  If one woman is having sex with all the men, she's monopolizing the gene pool -- she's decreasing the chance of other women having sex with fit men.  And these other women want a shot too.  So women themselves have evolved to dislike other women having sex with lots of men.

**TL;DR: Men have evolved to be promiscuous.  Women have evolved to be selective.  Men have evolved to prefer women who are selective.  Women have evolved to dislike women who are promiscuous.**

*Note - I am attaching no moral judgment to any of this.  I have no problem with men who are chaste or women who are promiscuous.   These are just the very deep-seated reasons why our biology compels us to think of men as pimps and women as sluts.*


**UPDATE:** I feel somewhat compelled to defend my points, and since the criticism falls into five major camps, I'll address them here rather than in the commons.

**Criticism 1:** *We're not animals, we're people.*  Sure we are.  And we can overcome our biology much better than other species.  But at the end of the day, our base instincts are biological. My point is that the instinct to praise a man for wanton sex and criticize a woman for the same are deeper than the sociological norm that many Redditors attribute it to.

**Criticism 2:** *Promiscuity isn't controlled by biology*  Why would it not be?  At the risk of appearing to fall on the wrong side of the nature/nurture divide, I don't think it's a great leap to say most of our behavior is broadly chemically motivated.  (eg:The fact that we get oxytocin from cuddling makes us more likely to seek out other humans and be social.)  The point is that these claims are very hard to verify with genetic analysis, specifically because we don't have access to a wide gene pool of millions of  years of human evolution.  But it's not a great leap to say that broadly speaking, over the course of evolution, promiscuity levels, like every.other.trait in human beings, was selected for in some way or another.  It's common knowledge that on a species level, the size of the male's junk is directly related to promiscuity.

**Criticism 3:**  *Women who are promiscuous are likely to produce promiscuous male offspring too, which is good.*  In the prevalent evolutionary psychology model, male promiscuity and female promiscuity are two distinct genotypes.  This is for the very reasons outlined above - male and female promiscuity are motivated by different physical needs and have different resource-allocation problems attached.  This is, again, not a great leap.

**Criticism 4:** *Women can't have evolved to dislike women who are promiscuous, because that's assigning values to things, which isn't biologically motivated.*  Maybe the mechanism is mis-worded, but the basic idea is that females who prohibit other females from becoming too promiscuous are more likely to survive.  Anyways, people have biologically-based impulses that result in value judgments all the time.  This berry tastes weird (it's poisoned), this milk smells bad (it's gone sour), this man is creepy (he's likely a rapist), the dark alley scares me (i'm unable to defend myself).  It's in no way a stretch to think that women could develop an aversion to women who were monopolizing male sexual attention.

**The Big One: Criticism 5:** *Evolutionary psychology is bullshit*.  

Maybe.  But I submit that if you believe that thought and behavior has a biological basis (certainly the brain itself ought to convince you...) and you believe in evolution (not a great leap on Reddit), then you should subscribe to at least the basis of evolutionary psychology.  After all, what makes evolutionary psychology different from other fields of evolutionary theory?  

Here's a question.  Have you seen the process of the evolution of the human eye?  Of course not.  We haven't found the intermediate steps in the puzzle.  But because we have the evolutionary framework, we talk in terms of the *selection mechanisms* at work, not in terms of finding the actual genes (or even particular structures) throughout history.  Same thing here - we're talking about the *selection mechanisms* at work, rather than the actual genes, because in almost all cases of macroevolution, *we have to do that*.  I have no idea whether cavemen millions of years ago were promiscuous or not, just as you have no idea what particular shape the eye took when it was first developed.  In fact, the best Richard Dawkins can do is point to the possible ways that the eye evolved and the *evolutionary pressures* that caused that evolution.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_adgy3,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adgy3/why_men_are_pimps_and_women_are_sluts_an/,

I'll try to make this as short as possible. I'm a 34 year old guy who has never had sex. My problem is a total lack of confidence due to a reason I deem so grotesque I feel I should warn people to not read on if they have weak stomachs. Basically I suffer from what is known as nodular acne or cystic acne, which I can only describe as large red bumps that are basically massive zits. Most people are familiar with ""bacne"", well imagine that about 20 times worse, and all over your entire body (even genitals and ass sometimes). I've tried every treatment all the way up to Accutane which is this super harsh medication with horrible side effects. I've tried 3 rounds of Accutane over the last 15 years but it returns quickly and with a vengeance (my last round I had to stop within a month because the side effects were so bad). I've been to more dermatologists than you could imagine and the consensus is there truly is no cure for this. It's like a kind of modern day leprosy.

I've seen a lot of wacky stuff on the internet but I assure you I've never seen someone who looks as gruesome as I do naked. I completely understand why girls want nothing to do with me just based on what they can see (acne on my neck, face, pockmarks). If I was a girl I'd be in the same boat - I'm just not sexually attractive and that's that. I've never told a single person about this aside from the therapists I've seen throughout my life - which really did no good as their advice ranged from fluffy ""its on the inside that counts"" nonsense to absolute bewilderment at my condition. Even if I had skin graphs and all that, the new acne would just ruin my skin all over again.

I've never had a girlfriend, been kissed, nor even had a girl express the slightest of interest in me. It's awful because lately I want sex so bad, sometimes I'll go days or even weeks where I feel so horny that I can't focus on anything, masturbation doesn't really solve much anymore, and even if I could have sex right now I'd be so disgusted at having my body be seen I'd find the situation a total turnoff, and the idea of a prostitute doesn't appeal to me one bit. To be honest I want love/relationship more than sex. Seeing all these happy couples enjoying their lives just kills me with jealousy and self pity.

To give a little more background info on myself: I'm self-employed (and fortunately I do rather well for myself), athletic (I ride anywhere from 20-40 miles a day) and not very socially awkward (I think?) -- I like to spend my time going to shows, bars, smoking herb and windsurfing... fairly ""normal"" on that front, I suppose, but I feel so infantile and embarrassed about being a virgin that I have no confidence, I'm super shy around any girl and it feels like each of these problems exacerbates the next problem, etc.

What should I do? Every single girl I see is so hot to me and I'm out of my mind craving girls but if I smile at one they either turn away instantly or give me a look that reduces me to nothing. This is really embarrassing to post but I'm just going to post it and hope for some helpful advice - I need it because I'm losing my effing mind and it's really hard to describe how sad I feel over all this.

I told the fiance that I would be getting home around midnight so don't wait up. I was able to get off work at 9PM and thought I would surprise her with some candy and a movie. I park the car and notice Jim's Ford in my space. That's weird. I open the door and all the lights are out. Even weirder. At this point I go into Ninja Stealth mode and creep up to our bedroom door which is shut. I put my ear to the door and hear very light moaning. My heart is now in my feet and my nerves are on end. I quickly open the door and flick the lights on and to my horror discover Jim sprawled out, masturbating, while my fiance is grinding on his face, completely naked. They were so into it, they didn't even notice the lights going on. I ran out of the house without saying word and sped off in my car. I'm now at a friends house and don't know what to do. I feel like buying a plane ticket and moving to Europe...

The other guy also lives with his girlfriend and they have a baby. We all work at the same firm.

Last week Lee and I ended our relationship. The age difference and political differences were weighing heavily on us. I found myself unhappy when I was with him, I couldn't look past his conservative views and support of Romney. No amount of affection or money can make me turn my back on human rights. 



My son is taking it pretty well. He misses Lee, they had grown close but he says he understands that I needed to do this. I think I'm going to back-burner dating until he's an adult. I can't do anything like this to him again. 

I'm grateful to the /r/relationship_advice community for its advice and support. I've learned a lot about myself in this relationship, despite being bummed that it didn't work out.

Not at all what I expected.,Sylveran-01,184,44,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/et11b/meeting_the_exfiancée_2_years_later_not_at_all/,"I chose to break things up with my Fiancée of 3 years back in early '09, about 8 months before the Spring Wedding. It caused a huge row that left me friendless, nearly broke and emotionally scarred. And I was the one that broke things up too. When I was finally able to see past my own depression, I went around asking friends-of-friends to see how she was doing. I'm not sure if hearing that she was deeply upset and in therapy made me feel better or worse. After a while, I decided it made me feel *worse*.

Anyways, it's been 2 years since. I bumped into her earlier in the month while doing Christmas shopping. At first, I didn't even know what to say and as I saw her walking towards me, I peeked a look, looked straight ahead while I gathered my thoughts, briefly considered crossing to the other side, looked again (this time caught her eye), decided it was too late to turn back now and nodded and said hello. She was actually very nice about it, though we were both clearly uncomfortable. We spoke for maybe 3 minutes in the middle of a crowded mall and it felt like it was *hours*. She did most of the talking, just like old days. She surprised me though, by asking me out for coffee after the holidays. That was today.

It's interesting to see how people change and how we all cope with that change. Some of us manage better and seek catharsis by re-evaluating, soul-searching and changing for the better; some of us stubbornly cling to our Old Ways in defiance, defending our position against any criticism. But we *change*, really.  In the end though, meeting her and talking to her didn't feel like Old Times. She's a very different person. Or maybe it's just me. Thing is, I wasn't ashamed to say I was still single, and it didn't phase me a bit to hear she's seeing someone else. If anything, I feel *happy* for her. And we had a *nice* chat. Like friends. Good friends, actually. It's a great feeling :D

So what I'm saying is, Not everything that ends up badly has to *remain* that way. People change; some even mature and grow as a result of Hardship. I wanted to share that so that Guys and Gals in Relationship_Advice know that there can be Friendship down the road, if you're both ready for it.

I totally forgot my password to my original throwaway, but I thought it was time for an update.

I've started to do some exercises. I walk much more than before and I have taken up Yoga in the mornings (I promised one of you that I'd try it, and when I promise, it's a promise I keep!). Yoga burns so much, and I get tired so quick, but everyday I'll get a little better and a little stronger. It might take awhile, but I'm going to get my hands on the floor eventually (I hope). That's my exercise right now. Everyday I add a little more. My husband bought me an Ipod and I loaded it with my music -- when there's something I don't wanna do (like exercise, etc) I insist on at least doing it through one song, and when I get started I usually keep going.

Eating wise, I've started Keto. It's strange. When I was eating before I couldn't stop eating. Now I feel full on the smallest meals (please see: these meals are probably normal sized). I feel more in control. That's not to say that when I see an ice cream bar in the freezer that I don't want it. I do, but I can close the freezer and walk away now.

I've lost about seven pounds since my post. I'm not saying this is to the moon awesome -- I have no idea what good loss would be... But I do know that losing seven pounds is much more awesome than gaining seven pounds, even if it is water weight.

In my regular account, I've joined up on /r/loseit, /r/keto, and /r/progresspics. I'm hesitant to join /r/fitness because I'm still only crawling along activity-wise, but I should probably just suck it up and lurk so I can get their energy. I am considering doing a couch to 5k program once I get a little more active and think I can handle it.

My husband and I had another talk. He said that he loves me, I'm his life partner, and he'd like to have me for a long long time. We talked food, we talked exercise, and he's rooting for me. He's always been super supportive of whenever I've tried to take healthy steps in the past (and very patient when I've failed flat on my face) so he hasn't given up yet -- but I'm going to succeed this time.

This is a big thing, her trying to just take the big decision for us both. She wants to have babies very much and have had it that way for some years. I want kids, but I dont want to do it right now, on our way out of a big crisis.

Okay, here's the situation: recently became wife and mother. The relationship with my husband was great before the baby, and it isn't terrible now... yet. We have both been on edge recently, me mostly because of all the hormones and sleep deprivation, and for him I think it's more the fact that we haven't had sex since the baby yet.

I have been waiting to feel all in love and sexy again, but all I feel is sore, cranky and irritated. Sometimes I hear myself yelling or being snarky at him, but I just can't stop it. I hate it. I have the best husband, he takes care of me and the baby and gives me everything I want. He's been able to take my mood swings for now, but I'm afraid it won't last forever.

So here's my plan that I thought of today: I'm gonna ""fake it till I make it"". Try and start acting like I was when we first fell in love. Hug and kiss him spontaneously, leave little love notes, ask him about his day and really listen, tell him I love him, etc. I think this will stop the gap between us from growing, and I will actually start feeling better and won't lose this wonderful relationship in the meantime.

Any suggestions to what else I can do? Or what do you think about this plan in general? Any perspective will be helpful and kindly appreciated.


Edit:

1) I'm back. Redditors, thank you SO MUCH for your thoughts and advice! You gave me so much to think about. Your support made me smile, laugh and cry and I feel so much better now!

2) First day of my plan is going well I'd say. Made husband lunch for work, which made him really happy. Planted some candy and a love note in his pocket for him to find later. Was affectionate and did not yell once. Ultimate test for my patience was when husband placed his socks in the wrong hamper - I know, heinous crime, right... nonetheless would have made me go off the deep end before this attitude shift - and what did I do? Picked up socks, threw socks in correct hamper, moved on. Success!

3) About the sexy times... I'm eight weeks post partum and I still feel weird being touched. This is extremely hard for me to admit, but I'm scared of sex like it's the first time ever, even though no ""damage"" or trauma resulted from labor. I don't know? maybe I feel weird because I haven't been able to check if things work down there by myself... I would definitely like to give him more BJs - have done so twice since the baby - I'm not gonna bore you with baby troubles, but it's just that sooo many things have to align for us to have a moment just for the two of us.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1358979740.0,,,True,t3_174g2b,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/174g2b/my_plan_to_save_my_marriage/,

We've gone out on several casual your typical run of the mill coffee/sausage &amp; beer dates but nothing serious.  I like him.  Even after the first encounter during the 'are you a serial killer' vetting process, I felt like I knew him for years.  And that I knew him a little too well.  He's funny and always has the right deadpan one liner response for everything.  At first I thought, 'damn, we have the exact same sense of humor.  yes, yes and YES!.'  Upon further thought and with suspicion growing, he jokes seemed a bit too familiar.  
  
Don't get me wrong, quite often I get my source of inspiration from Reddit.  I've taken more than my fair share of jokes from here, but like an honest person, I usually say where i heard it from giving credit where creative credit is due.  
  
  Back to the story.  So I began to see this familiar reddit-like theme with his joke telling.  That's okay.  I brushed it off.  Fast forward to two weeks ago.  We were in the middle of our usual story telling session, when it was his turn, he came out with this  [gem](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/km3m1/hotel_workers_whats_the_weirdest_thing_youve_ever/c2lerw1), swapping out the gay boyfriend for his ex-girlfriend.  
  It took me forever to find the story on Reddit, but when I did, there was no denying it.  I was dating a paraphraser.  Since then, I've caught him saying at least three other stories that I remember reading.  Finding them was impossible, but these stories I could clearly recall as having seen them before.  
  
  **TL;DR I am dating a guy who is crediting stories on reddit as his own.  What do I need to do to keep dating this man but make him stop with the paraphrasing?**

To be clear, the reason why I'm asking for help is that I really want to keep seeing him.  I also want him to start telling me things about his life.  I hope that since I've posted on here, that you will find this and we can talk about it.  I don't want to confront you in person because it's awkward, I'm awkward and I hate confrontation.

It was your dad calling and I was going to say Hi.....""

I feel completely smothered. The big problem is that I'm really shy and don't want to share that I'm attempting to date. The way I see it is that there is no reason to tell anybody about my first dates. It isn't a big deal (but my family would make it into the story of the decade and the gossip would spread faster than a wildfire) and there is a high chance that a first or second date won't amount to anything which then turns into more gossip about ""breaking up"" with a second date girl...like that is a true relationship to start with. 

I'm just concerned about my impending phone call tonight. I have absolutely no obligation to answer the inevitable question of ""where were you last night"". I'm a damn 24 year old man who lives 700 miles away from my family and I should be free to do as I please in the evenings.

I think I might just have to man up and admit that I went on a date. The problem is that the date ended rather abruptly so I'm not really sure the future of that relationship...but holy hell is this girl amazing. 


**Edit:** so I just called and the first thing he said is that ""he didn't call last night because they got home too late"". It eliminates any conversation, but doesn't solve any problems either. 

**Edit 2:** now he mentioned that he called but didn't make a big deal about it. Still not solving any problems. 

After the conversation I've decided that he is as much of a wimp as I am. He didn't ask why I didn't answer and I didn't mention that I knew he called.

1293356940.0,141,self.relationship_advice,erl7s,5 months ago I had a loaded gun to my head over someone. It's never THAT bad; take it from someone who knows. ,bitchthrownaway1986,170,29,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/erl7s/5_months_ago_i_had_a_loaded_gun_to_my_head_over/,"I just wanted to share my story with some of you that might be going through a rough time. 

5 months ago I was dumped by the woman I thought was the love of my life. We had been together for 5 years and I had started making plans to propose to her, and was even making engagement plans with my family. 

The end came after years of her mistreating and manipulating me. I had sacrificed everything for her; better universities; studying abroad; living abroad; my credit; my friendships. She never reciprocated in even the smallest degree; every minute sacrifice I asked of her was shot down with complaints, bad-attitudes and outright refusals. Added to this she would periodically cheat on me, and refuse to apologize for it. 

And finally, she broke up with me while on vacation in a foreign country, while I was stuck working to pay rent on our apartment back in the states. She left me for a guy she'd been cheating on me with, who she then married within weeks of leaving me. 

I was a wreck. I had at this point in my life lost many if not most of my friends (due to a combination of both my stupidity and her infidelity). I was working 70 hour weeks - getting little to no sleep - just to pay my bills and didn't have the time to rebuild my life in her aftermath. 

People, especially women, can sense when you're in a funk and tend to stay away. The handful of friends I had left tried as best they could to help me, but they had their own lives and concerns to deal with. My initial attempts at rebuilding a social life floundered and failed. 

The low point came about 5 weeks after she left me. I was sitting in our apartment surrounded by OUR things, her smell, her photos, and the complete loneliness that had taken hold of my life, and I couldn't take it anymore. I wrote a letter pouring my heart out on the paper, telling her how she'd wronged me; how she'd destroyed my life; how I had nothing left. I grabbed my 9mm out of the bedside table, flicked off the safety, and chambered one of the hollow-point rounds. I was sobbing when I put the nose of the pistol on the side of my head and angled it so that it would tear through my brain stem stopping my heart instantly. 

I sat like this, in silence, for a good thirty minutes. Then I remembered this guy I had met while volunteering at a convalescent home; he'd shot himself in the head with a pistol when he was 21 years old. He'd fucked up the shot and survived. Now his family had to come visit him while some 50 year old male nurse changed his Depends and cleaned the shit from his often-erect penis. 

The indignity of it terrified me. Maybe I was never really going to do it, maybe I was looking for an excuse to puss out. It doesn't matter. It wasn't her fault; it was mine. I had let it get to that point; I had let her control my life; I had stopped sticking up for myself; I had stopped valuing myself. 

I put the gun away, and never spoke of it to anyone. I've never told a soul about that day in August. EVER. 

I hit the gym. Deleted and blocked her from facebook, I blocked her number, and her emails. Got out of the house and started having fun. Things got better. I got more confident, and started dating again. I rebuilt my social circle. I started having a blast. 

I still have serious trust issues from her, and it's something I'm working on, but it's going to be a very long time until I can trust anyone ever again. 

Just remember: it's never that bad. Life will go on and you'll forget about them. 

Also, sometimes we forget to stick up for ourselves in relationships. It's important to have boundaries and emphasize equality in all of your relationships. Never let yourself be taken advantage of.

He asked me to send another email to her saying it was all a lie. I told him that his lies suck and anyone with a brain will see through them. He begged me to give him my password. I said fuck no. he called me a fat bitch. Like that would make me do anything for him, right?

Anyway she emails me and thanks me, that she had seen a picture of us in his computer a few weeks back and they had had a row over it, that she had wanted to break up with him, but he convinced her it was old. She told me that she was sorry i had to go through that. She believed it all and she was going to break it off with him.

I told her that he had called me up trying to lie for him, to be strong no matter what lies he tells her.

In all it went well, i feel like shit cause i know she is also heart broken, but i feel now that he might not do this again, that he knows he won't be able to get away with it anymore. That no one will take his crap and his lies.

EDIT So i'm finding about some more shit about this guy, i have no clue who he really is. He is texting and calling me to stop and to take down this thread so i don't do anymore damage to his relationship. He doesn't want her to know the truth, hope you see this D cause you are up shit creek.

EDIT He is now asking me to help him, to not mess this up for him. I found out some really gross shit, good thing i'm getting tested soon.

EDIT Talked to the girl, she's a really good person. Don't think she'll believe any of his lies. He told me that he blocked me everywhere (like i care) that i need to work on myself (that's hilarious)

*EDIT* I still can't believe the caring kindhearted man i knew is a total stranger. He blames me for all that has happened when all he had to do was break up with me months ago. Which he told me was to spare my feelings, bullshit. He would talk about how i should kill myself if he ever died so i wasn't ever with anybody else, there were so many red flags and i ignored them cause of love. I feel like an idiot. I'm not crying over this though, he is a total psycho. Its also really funny that he told me that i had better not go on dates or fuck anyone else while we tried fixing things, man this guy is crazy. He also told me never to let anyone take advantage of me, not even him, and when i don't, well he doesn't like it does he.

I feel like shit though, he knew this happened to me before. He didn't care about my feelings, i have no clue what were lies and what was truth. Now my mind is always going to be geared this way.

Well, I officially broke it off with him on Monday, and it ended absolutely badly. Within the last week of breaking up with him, I tried explaining how I didn't feel comfortable for the way he was treating me and he was really defensive, and quickly turned it to ""You underestimate how easy I can change"" after I hinted at ending the relationship.

On Monday, it got nasty and it ultimately ended up with me being blocked from Facebook and in turn I deleted his number. Tuesday I got my period (thank goodness!) but Wednesday came bad news..

I'm not sure whether or not some of you read, but I did take an STD test when I went to get plan b. I got the results, and the bastard gave me Chlamydia. The reason I know it was him, was because I happened to take an std test before meeting him, and he was the only partner I was with after the first std test.  I immediately tried contacting him but that's when I ofund out he blocked me from Facebook. I did send him a message on Okcupid, (which is where we met) and I haven't heard a response from him since.

I'm handsome, educated, hard-working, from good breeding, intelligent, and in great shape. I'm not a cocky asshole (I'm simply saying this to create some context), and every woman I've ever been with before I got into PU told me I was incredibly sweet and kind. 

I got dumped after a five-year relationship, and I just got tired of feeling like I was the one being chosen, rather than I was the one doing the choosing; basically I was sick of feeling like I was there at the whim of the woman. I was bitter and angry, so I decided to get into PU.

It has completely destroyed my faith in women and humanity in general. I have seen women that would swear up and down that this shit wouldn't work on them, and it always does. I've seen women cheat on their husbands and long-term boyfriends. Now I am by no means a expert at PU; I've just begun to apply some of the principles in my every-day life, and been hanging around with other PUAs. Let me tell you, this shit is like giving ""dynamite to little kids,"" as some have said. It fucking works, especially for me because of the aforementioned qualities, and it terrifies me.  

I'm despairing. True love and faithful relationships don't exist. The people who stay together are fucking miserable, and the ones that divorce often try to fuck each-other over in the process. Women can be scandalous, snarky, manipulative, mean, and in return are easily manipulated and seduced. 

Seriously, fuck this shit. What's the fucking point? I'm a romantic who's completely lost his faith in women and love.

Been together over a year.


I'm leaving him. I went to see a free crisis therapist and they helped me call him to tell him what was going on. I'm getting a restraining order, 
hopefully... But I'm not pressing charged.


He was sorry and said he under stood and he'd leave to his parents in a few hours and stay there. I got a police escort home when he said he left, to make sure he did and he had.


This is hard and heartbreaking for me...


Also, to those comments saying that I downplayed my act of tossing the shoes, I assure you, I didn't. I really did only toss them and he even admitted that after he hit my head into the wall that he realized how insignificant my act had been. It wasn't aimed at him, the fish, or the wall and it wasn't hard.


I do get out of the house every day without him and go on walks. I love my alone time redditing and such and want to make friends. I don't follow him around all day, expecting him to hang out and pouting if he doesn't. And I didn't not let him leave after he said he didn't feel any love or lust or joy. I suggested we split then, and he said no and that he didn't really mean any of that and he was just tired and he really loved me and he did feel lust, just not all the time.


The argument was that he did tell me positives, yes, but they're directly opposite to the negatives he keeps saying and it's messing with my head, so what does he really think? No, I wasn't calm or collected, yes I did cry and not accept the good he said. Yeah, I am part of the reason we had the argument, but I didn't do anything that deserved my head put into a wall and a fucked up face...

",girlpriest,161,26,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/101scs/i_27_f_need_to_write_a_letter_to_my_parents_both/,"It was mostly psychological and ""spiritual"" abuse.  While we did not normally live communally, I was raised in a pretty strict, separatist cult.  I was reluctantly allowed to go to public school, but was discouraged from making friendships.

I went through a very normal adolescence.  But my parents could not handle this.  I liked boys -- nice, all American, baseball playing, kind, boys.  The kind of boys you would WANT your daughter to date because they are so respectful of her.  As I began sneaking around with my first boyfriend, teachers, other parents, and my friends encouraged me to just tell my parents and stop sneaking around!   After all, the relationship was SO innocent (we had barely kissed) and so very age appropriate.  So took their well meaning advice.

That night, December 23, 1999, I learned that the well meaning advice of others is not always correct.  My parents freaked the fuck out.  They got me tested for STD's (I had not, as yet, had sex, though I did end up fucking a couple years later). They also called the police.  It began four years of terror.

I developed Anorexia, which I now understand was because I felt a total loss of control.  I threw myself into my piano studies as an outlet for my emotions.  

I could go on, but I'll keep it brief.  There were times when I was not allowed to sleep in a bed; I had to sleep on the floor of the living room so I could be watched 24/7.  There were times I was not allowed to speak to my own grandmother WHO LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE AS US because she took my side.

They pulled me out of therapy for my anorexia because, in their words, I had ""pulled the wool over her eyes too"".  In other words, she liked me and that just wasn't right to them. *This stuff is just the tip of the iceberg.*

Here is a good summary of how I spent my teenage years.  I am the oldest of 5.  4 girls, then a boy.  My mom caught be doing something she disapproved of.  All 5 of us were in the van.  I was sitting in the front seat, next to her, crying.  And she screamed to my siblings in the back, ""KIDS.  Promise me you won't be like Jessica.""  There was silence.  ""Say it!"" she yelled again.  And from the back came 4, quiet little voices mumbling, ""I won't be like Jessica.""

Like I said, tip of the iceberg.  

When the phone rings and it's them, I have a panic attack and don't answer.  Sometimes for months.  When we do talk, they ask nothing personal and act like everything is OK.

**My family doctor is also a psychologist.  I have been in therapy with him and he is great.   He believes it is time for me to write my parents an email and ask them to acknowledge the abuse.  If they refuse, he thinks I am better off without them and I am likely to agree.**

I realize this will hurt them.  But that is not my PURPOSE.  I no longer feel anger and I no longer actively wish harm on them.  Quite the opposite.  With therapy, I have come to view them as ""ill"" and a product of their own upbringing and bad choices.  (We all make bad choices).  **But I cannot go on pretending I am OK with things as they stand, avoiding their calls for months, and not visiting for years at a stretch with no explanation.**

I would like a relationship with them that is somewhat honest.  I need to be myself, but I don't NEED to reveal every dirty detail, if that makes sense.

Am I in the wrong?",throwaway45831,171,35,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j9a9w/my_brother_has_hiv_and_it_is_his_own_fault_im/,"My brother (21) has been acting out for about a year and a half, since he came out of the closet to my parents. My parents are very open-minded about it and they were supportive from the beginning. He decided that the best course of action after graduating from high school was to start going to gay clubs every night in suburban Florida and in that crowd he selected the worst of the worst for his friends. He failed out of college, he was kicked out of nursing school on the first day after he tried to cheat on a drug test, and last Christmas I found out he was turning tricks and not using protection, as well as starring in gay porn. He never has sensed the gravity of the situation, or understood the danger he was putting himself in, or the hurt he was causing his family, despite my attempts to communicate it to him. All he cared about was fucking strangers and smoking weed. I told my parents, obviously, and they did everything they could to bring him to his senses, but he fell back into the lifestyle quickly and disappeared for two months with no communication.

Then one day he came back to my hometown and looked like he was on death's door, so my parents called him an ambulance and he was taken to the hospital and tested for HIV. Fast forward two months, it's a week before I visit my hometown with my new girlfriend and he calls me up to tell me. He says the words in the most monotone voice and I ask him to hand the phone to my mom. I go down to Florida anyway, and spend the week I wanted to use to introduce my girl to my parents hand-wringing over my brother. When I visited him, all he could talk about was how it sucked that he couldn't have sex anymore with random strangers and how smoking weed was great for the physical pain. Again, no comprehension of how much he has hurt the people who love him or regret at not listening to us when we told him he was acting like a psychotic teenage manchild (couched in nicer terms, of course). And now my parents have to take care of him for the rest of his life because he's unable to do it on his own, and his HIV treatments (paid for by my mother) cost so much money my family is going into debt.

All I can do is feel absolutely disgusted and angry at him. My parents are good people and raised him well, they instructed both of us in sexual safety, and welcomed him with open arms when he told them he was gay. He was never sexually abused as a kid, although in high school he dated a heroin addicted emotionally abusive guy. He is completely self-centered and unaware of the damage he has caused himself and the people who care about him by acting so irresponsibly. But I can't fucking say it to anyone because when a family member has a chronic/terminal disease, you're supposed to be lovey and supportive because they will be gone. I don't feel like being lovey and supportive. I actually hate him, because my family is breaking apart over this and my dad is close to suicidal, and I want to know if you think I'm overreacting.

Of course, I don't plan on telling him this ever. I will put on the supportive face when I have to. But he may live another 20-50 years, and because I feel this way about him and because he is now the rotten center of my parents' lives, it's not possible to talk to them without talking about him. And it makes me rage inside.

**edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and advice. **I will definitely be talking to him in the next few weeks, once I am able to gather my thoughts. I'm not going to tell him I hate him, because one thing I realized responding to comments all night was that I don't really hate him. I'm just really, really fucking angry at him and his callous stupid behavior. But I can moderate that and try to have a constructive conversation. I will also be looking into alternate avenues for antiretrovirals with my parents so that he is not such a drain, and suggest that they might test him for meth or have the hospital do so next time he is there (which is a lot lately.) For now, though, I need to stop talking about it on reddit and focus my mind elsewhere.

You have my sincere thanks for your support and suggestions, even those of you who didn't think my anger was justified. I really only wanted to talk to a few people to see what they thought and maybe blow off some steam and I was surprised so many people were willing to leave a word of condolence or agreement or righteous indignation. Talking it out with hundreds of strangers has put it in perspective in a way therapy never has for me before (though I haven't been since I found out his diagnosis.) I hope you are well and remain well, and never have to go through something like this with someone you love.

I've been a recreational drug user and have enjoyed going to parties, well, since highschool. I met this awesome girl/chick/woman through a mutual friend and we hit it off. 

Once we start to get serious she tells me that she is too old for the kind of shit that I do (staying up a couple days at a time, bar hopping more than once a week, recreational drug use, etc) and that I need to chill out. I eventually tone it down enough for her to stay with me,  but she still bitched about how immature and asshole-sh I was every single day.

She eventually asks me to spend more time at home ( we lived together ) and chill out even more. ""It's time to grow up, get a better job, and act like we're together"" is a decent summary of what she said. So I did. It's now 5 months later, I'm making decent money, we now have a stable life and so on, then out of the blue she tells me it's over because I we have ""lost the spark"" and things ""have become a routine"".

I figure perhaps they may be voicing similar woes as some of the Reddit community, so I thought I may pass on my advice.

♥ The first, and the most important above everything else tip is **GET OUT OF YOUR ROOM!** Seriously, you complain you never meet any girls but if you're holing yourself up in your room your entire life you're never going to even have the chance! Now I love my computer and gaming as much as the next nerd, but seriously, they will NOT come to you (girls that is, not games)!
*But Pinball, I don't have any friends IRL to go out with!*
Pussy excuse. Man up, and go out there alone. You don't need someone holding your hand to go to a pub or bar down the road! 
*But Pinball, won't I seem like some lonely crazy freak sitting alone?*
Well no you won't, because that brings me to my next point---

♥ The second, and the most important above everything else tip is **CONFIDENCE! YOU NEED IT!**
Let me tell you about my friend, let's call him Frodoricknaut for the sake of privacy. Now Frodoricknaut has so much going for him. He's a perfect gentleman, kind, considerate, hilarious, warm and a gamer, not to mention cute. There's no reason why girls shouldn't be fighting over him. Except one, big, major factor. Frodoricknaut has zero self esteem. *What?!* I hear you cry out, throwing plates of noodles in the air in surprise, *What the hell is wrong with him?!*
Well the short of it is his parents royally screwed him in the head when he was growing up but that's not the point of the story, the point of the story is do you see how even someone who has everything else going for him can be stuck in singleness limbo through one seemingly small issue?

For yes, buckos, a lack of confidence is the ultimate turn off. This also answers the question why the bad boys get the good girls, because the bad boys are sexy and they know it, and when they aren't sexy, they fool you into thinking by using their confidence to dazzle. DAZZLE!

*But Pinball, I don't have any confidence, i'm ugly/fat/freckled/poor/homeless/toothless--*

Please, you think I have confidence? Fuck no! I'm one of the most messed up people you'll ever know, years of therapy and countless brands of anti depressants, ritalin and therapy and I still am convinced I am the most hideous person alive. But you know why I get by in life? Because I've learnt to *fake* it. It's really not as hard as you might think! Sure it takes practice, but it's not impossible.  So LEARN to FAKE it, if you fool others into thinking you're an attractive, fun, perfectly sane individual, they won't know any different!

♥ The last, and the most important above everything else tip is **TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!**
Seriously guys, basic hygiene can do wonders! These are things your mom if you had one should have told you, if you didn't have a mom of course you can be somewhat forgiven but the rest of you, here's a reminder.

* Shower daily. Yes daily, you sweat, we all do. It is not the sweet sweet sexy perfume you think it is.
* Brush, or style your hair. And by god, get a hair cut if it's below your shoulders, if you want your women to make the effort to look good, you gotta look good yourself and the long haired hippy look? Yeah does not look good. (On the opposite scale, buzz cuts-- no. Just no. Unless you are in the army, don't do it.) (Oh, btw, best place to get a haircut? Not in your bathroom with a pair of scissors or a rusty razor, no,at the hairdressers. Don't worry, it won't cost you too much, and it'll be worth it. *(Extra bonus point tips for the specially dedicated-- ask a female, any female, to choose a style that will look good on you. And trust their advice)*
* Deodorant, should be a given but I know many guys who need a reminder every now and then (same goes for brushing teeth twice daily, and using mouthwash)
* DO NOT wear the same clothes everyday, yes, it's all very shallow but women do notice it 
* And along the same lines, wear clothes that look GOOD on you. Again, ask a female or stereotypical gay man and i'm sure they'd be more than willing to tell you what's a goer and what's not. Don't whine, you don't have to wear it all the time, but if you wanna pick up, you wanna look good.

SO guys, now you have read the crash course, get out there, look good, strut, keep the chin up high, smile, look and feel inviting, and you'll be set! Need any clarification or more help, just ask!

Much love, I know you all have it in you,

Pinball x

We have been a couple for almost 6 months, and we are both 22 years old.

This is the first serious relationship, for the both of us, though my girlfriend does have some sexual experience, she is my first.

My girlfriend has always been a bit insecure about her body (she used to be overweight a few years ago, but she has a perfectly fine body now), though I always try and reassure her she is very attractive (outside of the bedroom as well).

We've been having sex for the past 3 months now (we used to have a problem at first, long story short, she was too tight) and I noticed that I had to initiate sex every.single.time

I thought this had something to do with her insecurity, so I didn't think too much of it.

She would also often ""refuse"" sex, as in if we were making out in bed, and I'd start touching her she'd say ""no"", but always in a giggling way so I rarely took it serious, thinking she was just being playful. If I did stop completely, she would sometimes go back to heavily making out, or going down on me. So I honestly have no idea what to think.

A few hours ago though, we were fooling around and again she told me ""no"" but this time she also added ""I'm not in the mood, so stop""

That already made me feel a bit weird. So she got up and sat down at the end of my bed. I got up next to her and asked her what's wrong and she basically told me I sometimes have to accept no as an answer.

She made it sound like every time she told me no (which quite frankly, now that I think about it, was 90% of the time we had sex) she really meant no, and not in the playful way like I thought.

I honestly feel very sad/disgusted with my self right now. I can't stop thinking how every single time we have had sex right now, was unwillingly from her side, and that she doesn't find me attractive/I'm no good. I am also never ever initiating sex with her ever again, I am honestly too ""scared"" right now.

I don't really know what advice you can give to me, I just wanted to write it down somewhere.

My girlfriend (was a year or two younger than I) at the time got into one of those little-ivies, and I raced to apply to any BS school that would take me. A lot of universities application deadlines passed. I got in, and moved 300 miles away from any family to a small town where there were no people, and nothing going on. I made no friends. After not even a full month of living up here, she completely changed who she was, entirely as a person and basically opened her whore gates. I found out eventually. We split. The relationship was probably terrible. I lost all of my friends and people skills because of her. I haven’t really been with anyone since. I realized a friend of mine whom I had known since I was 1 lived in the city. We started hanging out again, and have been pretty much inseparable ever since. He, just like I, isn’t a very good people person. Neither of us approach girls anywhere, and rarely know what to say when they approach us. Whenever a girl is saying something flirty or something to one of us we’re completely oblivious to the fact. 

Fast forward to about 5 weeks ago. I was sitting at a bar (120 beers on tap, 200 bottled beers) with my best friend. It was a Sunday night and we were unwinding after a long weekend of studying. Drinking a few beers, watching sports on one of the seemingly thousands of LCD tvs suspended from the ceiling and mounted on the walls throughout the restaurant. No big sports games were on that night so the bar wasn’t very busy. I do a small scan of the area and notice this head of long dark hair. (I’m a sucker for long dark hair) I eventually end up making eye contact with her and as soon as it happened I quickly looked down at my drink in front of me. We end up making eye contact a number of times. I found it odd. I was too shy to really look at her, and entirely too shy to go up to her and say anything. My friend and I finish our meal and get ready to head out. That girl whom I’ve been playing eye-chase with all night just so happened to be leaving too. We walk out of the bar and stand on the corner to cross the street. That girl and her friend leave too, and walk right behind us crossing the street the other way. Me, still too nervous to look. We cross the street, and as soon as we do I get the feeling to look behind for her. Sure enough, I caught her doing the exact same thing. I tell my friend about it, and tell him about how badly I wanted to go talk to her. He jokingly told me to go do it, and then realized I was serious and “friended-up”. Started to seriously tell me to go do it. The girls had walked two blocks by this point. I eventually agree, and we drive towards them. After a little more debate I jump out of the car and sprint towards them. A thousand different things are running through my mind as I'm jogging towards them. 5 feet behind them my mind went completely blank. I had absolutely NO idea what I was supposed to say. What the fuck was I doing? I startled them at first. I looked at her and asked her name, and said the words “I just wanted to tell you that I think you look very pretty.” She was completely taken away, stumbling over her words, speechless. She managed to do was introduce herself. Her friend ended up talking for her. Barely any conversation happened other than the fact that apparently she mentioned something to her friend about me, just as I did to my friend. I didn’t get her number. We departed with a laugh and “it was nice looking at you?” Holy shit, I just chased a girl down the street and told her how pretty I thought she was. Did that just work? I went home ecstatic. 

The next Sunday I managed to talk my friend into going to the same place, with a slight hope of her being there again. She wasn’t at first, but eventually showed. I was even more nervous this time, locking eyes with her every so often. Too nervous to go up to her, we left. My friends crossed the street and I stopped dead in my tracks and said to myself “no. fuck this. I didn’t pass this up the first time and I’m sure as hell not going to pass it up again.” I told them I’d be there in a second. I went back into the bar, and motioned her away from her friends. I gave her my phone number this time, and she blushed. She textd me a few minutes later. Holy shit, that worked?  We’ve been in contact constantly since. Either texting, calling, or with each other in person.

We meet up at the same bar a week later and talked for six straight hours. I felt like she was in to me. I met one of the most funny, sweet, smart, beautiful girls I’ve ever met. We met up again a few days after, and kissed. This girl was great. She was 28, moved here 4 years ago from a very large South American country, and is training to work in the airline industry. She loves animals, loves good beer, and has a tiny scar on her eyebrow from riding a tricycle into a wall when she was a little girl. Shit, seven years older than I? We hung out a few more times and it has been bliss. Unfortunately she doesn’t even live in this state, and the only reason she is in this city is for the job training. Our time was limited. Whenever we hung out we would sneak away from our friends to go kiss. Yesterday at the park I had her show me where the bathroom was so I could pull her into some trees to kiss her. She pulled me into an alley after lagging behind our friends while bar hopping just to sneak in a kiss. Whenever we get together we can just talk for hours on end. I haven't met anyone in over a year and a half that when they talked, I was sincerely interested in what they were going to say. The fact that I could just meet up with her and have legit conversation for hours? Then kiss her? This was too surreal. I don't make connections with people very often at all. We connected. 

Last night was the last night I think I’ll ever see her again. We spent 3 hours talking in my car until 4am after a night out with friends. (she had to be up at 6 too, ouch). She told me about how I chasing her to tell her that she was pretty made her feel like a little girl again. It made her feel so great about herself. How amazing it felt to actually feel wanted for once. (I too, feeling all of these same things.) She told me that she was extremely sad that she had to leave, that she really liked me. Her training is done, so it is finals week this coming up week and she is flying home on Friday. No time to hang out. Bear in mind that if there is any chance, we will see each other again.

This is the first girl I’ve been even remotely interested in, in over the last year and a half. I’ve had opportunities, but haven’t felt any connection with any of the girls I’ve gone out on a date with. But some random girl in a bar. Some random girl in a bar that I chased down the street to tell her how pretty I thought she was. 

I'm sorry, reading over this it has turned into me rambling. While it sucks that I’ll probably never see her again, this experience was invaluable. The point of this story is I met this amazing girl because I stepped out of my comfort zone. For once I told myself to man the fuck up go for what I wanted. I met an amazing girl whom I could comfortably see myself dating all because I had the nerve to chase her down the street just to talk to her. 

**Tl;dr - Don't pass up an opportunity because you're scared or nervous. Step out of your comfort zone. You might meet one of the most amazing people you've ever met. Don't be scared. To guys - girls are just regular people too. Despite how attractive you think they look, they might feel mediocre. They can be just as nervous and shy as you.**

Forgive me for any grammatical errors. I'd proof read and fix, but I've got to get back to studying.

Edit: Upon thinking it over, I partially have the people on reddit to thank for my brazen decision. Before the chase I thought back to when I'd read a similar surreal situation story here on reddit, where some guy did something similar. So thank you, you wonderful community of people. Your stories are more inspirational than you think.

He is my first serious relationship, and we have been together for 2 years.

Part of the reason I do not have more dating experience is that I have tuberous breasts (here is Wiki explanation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberous_breast_deformity), which is a congenital breast deformity.

Basically, I have long, saggy, nipples, but no breast tissue.  As a result, I have always had to wear very padded bras so that I don't look odd in clothing.  Only my close friends and SO are aware of my condition.

Recently, I saved up enough money to get a breast augmentation.  Due to the severe nature of my deformity, I have scheduled with a surgeon who is somewhat far from me, but has specialized training in correcting tubular breasts.

I am thin and petite, so I am trying to get an augmentation that appears about the same size as the padded bras I normally wear anyway.  I don't want many people to know about my deformity, or surgery, since it is none of their business.  However, I do have to take time off of work and travel to another city to get the surgery.

I asked my boyfriend to keep both my deformity, and planned surgery a secret.  He has been amazingly supportive throughout the whole ordeal, telling me that I am beautiful the way I am, but that he is there for me throughout the recovery process. 

However, this past weekend he went out drinking with friends.  I found out today that he was talking openly with all of them about my deformed breasts, and plans for surgery.  He described the current appearance of my breasts in detail, and told mutual friends that he was so glad I was getting the surgery, as he probably wouldn't have been able to stay with someone who ""looked like such a freak"".  He was also saying he was disappointed I am not getting super large implants.

When I confronted him about this, he admitted to telling his friends.  He said he felt like everyone would notice anyway and it was best to be honest.  He also said I shouldn't be mad because any guy would be put off by tuberous breasts, and I should be glad he has been with me for so long anyway.  

I felt so angry and betrayed that I ended the relationship.  I have to leave to get my surgery in two days, and I feel so scared and alone.  I am dealing with a lot of fear and anxiety about getting implants, did I make a mistake?  Should I give him a second chance?",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_elazp,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/elazp/my_so_told_friends_about_my_cosmetic_surgery/,

(NSFW),rpntygy,193,60,258,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1bwy68/38f_punched_me30m_during_threesome_last_night/,"Hey redditors, thanks for reading. I could use some help, although, I think I know the outcome.

I have been dating the woman I thought was perfect for me since last Nov. But things haven't gone all that smoothly and I have asked you guys for advice once before, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/199cf7/she_38f_keeps_pushing_my_30m_advances_away_after/). We have talked about our dead bedroom a handful of times, and had actually started to work on it just recently, and things looked up for us.

So last night, we went to our usual bar. A male friend of mine had hung out with us the night before, and showed up at the bar to hang with us again for a bit. We drink for about an hour, and another friend of her's shows up, a gorgeous woman we both find attractive, and know she is attracted to both of us, even though she claims to be a lesbian. The four of us hung out, and enjoyed ourselves for another hour or two, when our friends both decided to head out.

After a short time, we move to another local bar, and begin again, just the gf and I relaxing on a nice weekend. Surprisingly, the beautiful lesbian friend arrives, and we get a few more rounds, chatting and playing pool and games. Later in the night, while we are playing games, I notice the friend becoming touchy and trying to kiss the gf. So when we get a second free, I let the friend know I'm quite alright with whatever my gf does, and will never tell her what she can and cannot do. The friend lets me know she has been trying to kiss my gf, and I tell her I'm not going to stop them.

I leave them alone, and she goes back to the gf, continuing her efforts. After 10 minutes or so, my gf finally calls for me, and I walk over and tell the gf she can do whatever she likes. Happily, she starts to enjoy her friend, and they kiss, dance, and fool around in the empty bar. 

The gf and I have discussed our sexual relationship many times, and I had told her I would never ask for a threesome. I'm not a huge fan, mostly because I don't want the drama. She agreed, and has told me she is done with doing anything crazy like that anymore.

So the gf and her friend really start to get things going in the bar, and I have never seen such desire from my gf before. She dry humped her friend, a few times, as the kissed and groped. She grabbed her and they ran off to the bathroom, and I quickly followed. We locked the door, and they kissed for a bit. My gf tells her she doesn't want to leave me out, and the friend better be ok with that, and the friend kisses me deeply. So I'm cool. My gf pulls my dick out, and shows her, letting her know I am well endowed, and the slight curve hits perfect. The 'lesbian' agrees, and they both kiss and suck me a little. We all kiss, and she start to strip the girl, and we play with her tits a bit. We agree to head out of the bar and go home, and I tell the gf to head out of the bathroom first, so it doesn't seem like we are having a threesome in there. So she walks out, and I tell the friend thanks, and walk out a few seconds later. As I open the door, the gf punches me in the chest, full force. I look at her weird, and the friend grabs her and drags her off, kissing her. We finally hop in our vehicles, and head home.

At home get in the house, and the gf goes in the bathroom to pee. The friend follows her, and grabs her, and they start making out. Gf tosses her on the counter, and grinds against her, pulling her clothes off. Of course I join in, and when we are all finally naked, we stop, and head to the bed.

They start making out, fingering, enjoying each other, and I lay with them, helping. We all get a taste of the girls, a little at a time, and the friend lays back, as the gf gets on her hands and knees and eats her out. So, being the good bf, I put myself in my gf, having sex with her while she eats her friend. She enjoys this for a good bit, and they decide to switch. So the gf lays back, and the friend gets on her hands and knees. So I decide to walk behind the friend, and give her the same treatment. As I grab my cock and am about to put it in her, not touching her yet at all, the gf out of nowhere punches me in the chest again, full force. I stop, giving her a crazy look, and she winds back and hits me again, as hard as she can. The friend stops, and asks her what her problem is, and the gf yells at me, saying I should fuck her first. I told her I did already, a few times, which I did. She looks at me, and says I can't fuck her friend. So I shrug, and tell her fine, you have fun, I'm not going to stand in the corner and watch. I put on shorts and a shirt, and go to my car, and lay down in there. The gf comes running out, and screams at me, hitting my windows hard. I don't respond, kinda hurt, and she goes back to the house.

A few minutes later, I hear the friend get in her car and drive off. The gf comes out, and asks me to come back in the house. I decide to, and come back in the house. The gf apologizes, and tells me to come lay in bed. I go to the couch and lay down, and she gets me to come to bed. I can only lay there for a few minutes, and I get up, and lay back down on the couch.

This morning she got up when I did for work, which isn't normal. I was hurt and didn't want to talk about it, ignored her, mad. She apologized, and tried to talk, but I couldn't.

I've gotten over a lot of what happened, but not all of it. I'm really hurt by the way she went after her friend. We have a dead bedroom, and I beg for her to make me feel desired, and attractive. I try to fool around at times and be a little exciting, but she always shrugs me off, especially in public. I never get the type of attention or desire she showed last night, and I don't think I ever will from her.

She sent me a text this morning on my way to work, and apologized, saying she didn't want to lose me, and she loved me so much. I told her I just wanted a bit of the passion she gave her friend, and I have been begging for it for a while now.

So, long read, again thanks. I think I'm done with the relationship, because of the way she made love to the woman, and how much she put in to it. I wish she would make love to me even close to that, with half the passion and want for the partner. I have told her on a couple of occasions, but I guess she doesn't have it for me. What do you guys think? I really could use some help.

**tl:dr** Cute friend got into threeway, gf gets upset and punches me during, I'm leaving her for not having passion for me.

**Update**: Thanks for all the comments, a ton of good things were written for me to think about and consider. Most, if not all, want me to leave. Still don't know what I'm going to do, but I'm siding with Redditors. Plus, I found out I'm being abused, many ways, and I'm sexist. Awesome.

**Update 2**:GF texts me. 

GF :I'll leave you alone today, but I'm worrying about screwing things up.I'm sorry I couldn't follow through and I love you.

OP: I'm over you being jealous, and you punching me as hard as you can 3 times. I'm over the fact you wanted me to stand in the corner and watch while you had fun. What really hurt was the passion and desire you had for her. I beg for a little of that. Sorry.

GF:I'm sorry the thought of you enjoying her lit me up. I didn't expect to react that way.

OP: That's fine, do what you want.

GF: Please don't shut down, I made a mistake.

OP: I'm not shutting down, and we make mistakes.

GF: What does Do what you want mean?

OP: It means you do what you want. If you want to stay together, whatever. Don't expect me to be hapopy or pay attention to you at all for the next few days. Don't ever expect sex from me again. Feel free to do whatever you like sexually, I'm not going to stop you, even if I walk in on you and your partner(s). Never ask me to join or watch. Truly you made better love with another woman than I have ever know from you. You are playing for the wrong team.

GF: I'm not playing for the wrong team, if I was, I would have carried on with everything.

OP: Ok.

GF: If you don't want to be with me, then don't. I don't want you to leave, but it would crush me! But I don't want you to be unhappy either. This is not something we should be texting, I love you and still have passion for you.

And some texts from the friend.

Friend: Hey there, you ok?

OP: Fine. Sorry about last night. Neither of us are upset at you. Sorry that happened.

Friend: It's all good. You two going to be alright?

OP: What would you have done?

Friend: What do you mean? What would I have done?

OP: Yea. Sorry, I'm not alright. I have been in a shitty mood, practically begging her to gime me some attention to help me feel desired. What she gave to you last night, I will never see. She never lusts after me or desires me like that. Sorry to have brought this drama to your life.

Friend: It's ok. I've had my share of lond term relationships, I know what that feels like when the passion shifts.

OP: Well, stick around. I don't know if we can continue a relationship, and if we do, there will be no sex between us. So you will have a chance for alone time with her.

Friend: That's not what I want. I just wanted to have fun with you both last night. I don't have that kind of connection with her. Furthermore, she said flat out after you took off, how much she loved you and how afraid she was that you'd never come back. As I held her head up while she was crying, she turned away because she thought I was going to kiss her and she didn't want that she just wanted you and not to share you.

OP: I'm sorry, I have never seen her so into lust like that. I ask for it, thry different things, and she pushes me away. I can't get her to even touch me in the bar, let alone dry hump and make out in the bathroom like last night.

OP: And I don't know what she told you, but why do you think she punched me twice? Because I was about to play with HER toy.

Friend: Didn't think about that. I'm sorry, didn't mean to further complicate things for you.

OP: You didn't complicate things. I apologize for everything, and no one is angry or mad at you.

I got a couple messages asking me to update, but unfortunately there isn't that much to say, hence the delay. After reading all the response I got on my initial post, I eventually concluded that I was really uncomfortable with what she had written, but it wasn't necessarily a dealbreaker, especially if she was willing to maybe go to a therapist or something. A day or so after I posted, I tried to initiate a talk about it with my girlfriend, and she shut down completely. She got angry that I looked at her private stuff (like I thought she would) and accused me of invading her space and crossing boundaries. I tried to keep the conversation focused on what I had seen, and worked hard to avoid coming off as disgusted or judgmental, but she was very upset, and didn't respond positively to anything I was saying. When I tried to tell her I was still willing to try to be together, she said she didn't want to talk about it and wouldn't even let me finish making my point. Eventually she got up and went to a different room, effectively ending the conversation.

The word ""pedophile"" never actually came up in the conversation, but I think we both knew what we were actually talking about, and I'm guessing that part of her actions were because she was scared. 

In short, we've basically broken up. She left that night and went to her mom's house (she took her computer and all her electronics with her), and we haven't really spoken since. She called me about a week ago to let me know that she was going to get some of her stuff while I was at work, and when I came home that evening she had already been there and left again. Other than that I haven't really seen her.

I don't really know how I feel right now. In a way, I'm relieved that the decision to break-up/stay together was made for me, and I didn't actually have to find out if I could handle staying with my gf after knowing what she was into, but I'm also pretty shattered.

He will not participate as a member of the family, refuses to do anything but be online gaming/social networking, won't get a job to help out (we are NOT very well-off, financially) and only takes one class at school. He will not go to the psychiatrist anymore (he's 18 now, in charge of himself) and stopped taking meds. At least on meds he was more willing to go to therapy and work on being a part of the family. My husband had to quit a job 15 years ago to be a full-time, stay-at-home parent; now, of course, when he is able to work there is none to be had. Plus, just try and get a job as an older worker... All of this would be manageable if not for the way he constantly manipulates myself and my husband, one against the other, blackmailing and threatening (""I'll tell Dad you spent that money! If you shut down the internet I'll bust all the TVs in the house!"") and generally making everyone wish they were dead.

We had one mutual friend on fb when he messaged me and things just took off from there.  He wanted to meet and we exchanged numbers.  

In late Janurary we began messaging and texting on a daily basis.  I was a little reluctant at first because I had ended my engagement with my bf of 7 years in October and I was still a little nervous about seeing anyone. 

I fell for J right away, and I started feeling anxiety because of the excitement of a new guy and at the same time I was nervous about actually moving on.  What would my fiance say, my parents, my friends, his family?  In a matter of weeks I lost 12 lbs and I was completely head over heels for J.  He was the polar opposite of my fiance, tall, charming, talkative, and confident.  

We went to dinner for our first date and I was very timid and nervous, but it went well.  As we continued to talk, he kept pointing out how he felt I had no interest in him since I was so reserved.  It was to the point where I wouldn't answer his calls because I was so nervous.  I explained to him that I was not up for games and I was afraid of getting hurt.  I made it clear to him that I really liked him and my feelings for him frightened me. My fiance was the ONLY man in my life for 7 years and we were planning our wedding, naturally I wasn't ready for a new relationship.  

Valentine's Day came along and I was pleasantly surprised when he asked to take me on a second date, which he canceled that evening with a half ass excuse.  This is when I should've ran but I chose to give him the benefit of the doubt.  Every morning he'd text me cute little messages and he'd continue throughout the day.  Initially I was ok with just texting because I wanted to take it slow.  I was weary as to why he didn't push for more, but I convinced myself that if he wasn't interested in me he'd just stop looking for me period.  

In a span of several weeks we went on two more dates, and it was on our fourth date that we started messing around.  I told him that it didn't feel right because we weren't official and we wouldn't really see each other often and it made me feel slutty.  Again my mistake, nothing changed we continued with texting everyday and after our fifth date we went over to his place and had sex. After that, that's all it became.  He would text me everyday with pics of himself, his friends, dinner, or whatever it was he was doing.  Again, I told myself he's just a bachelor and he's having fun.  He'd make plans with me for real dates then he'd bail or cancel.  Yet, I convinced myself that since he looked for me everyday, he did like me.  Even though it hurt my self-esteem, if sex was the only way I'd get to see him I continued to stick around.  I did make it clear to him that since he didn’t want to take it further with me, he had to be honest.  If he got serious with anyone or started dating, I could no longer see him.  He always assured me that he was happy with what we had and that he barely had time for me, much less a gf.
It’s now been 5 months of this and last week I finally mustered up the courage to cut it off.  It hurt that he was totally ok with it, but why would I want someone who doesn’t want me?  I’d been doing really well getting over him, not even stalking his fb page anymore hehe.  Until yesterday, he shared a link and he had a comment that said “I love you!” from a girl I’d previously questioned him about and he’d said she was nobody, just a friend.  I was determined to find out once and for all if he just didn’t like me, or if there was someone else all along.  I found her instagram and it was there that I saw it all .  Even though I suspected it, I was still lied to and it hurt like hell.  He’s been with her for 10 months, and seeing me for 5, she’s so in love with him it makes me sick.  

Obviously, I never meant anything to him.  I should have kept what was left of my dignity and put my foot down a long time ago, but I couldn’t.  Me giving up was perfect timing for him because apparently she’s been out of state for an internship and gets back in a week.  He still doesn’t know that I know.  The question is should I tell her what a piece of shit bf she has?  Or is it not my place since I never meant anything to him?

TL;DR: I was someone’s f buddy for 5 months, turns out he has a girlfriend of 10 months.  Should I tell her about him cheating or should I just confront him and walk away? 

edit: ****UPDATE (somewhat)  I asked her for her email through instagram and she replied but I haven't mustered up the courage to tell her.  I'm sitting here staring at the long email I typed out for her.  Last night he had the audacity to text me at 2 am, I didn't reply.  This morning I told him I knew about her and I called him out on it, the principle is that he knew I would've never messed around with him if I knew he had someone else.  He said he knew lately I'd been asking around about him and that since last week when I told him I wanted nothing from him, he respected that and that I should do the same.  He said he's sorry for what he did, and that she's not his gf and I don't understand their relationship, for me to stay out of it.  I know for a fact that they are not in an open relationship, and the comments and pictures on her instagram say it all.  I'm 26 and I'm an elementary teacher, I have a decent reputation and my biggest mistake has been this idiot.  I feel she should know he's a cheater but I'm truly embarrassed to be caught up in this.  I'm afraid to open up this can of worms, I'm afraid people will find out and I'm afraid he'll harass me about it.

Yea.,basuraAcct,160,30,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kuegk/girlfriend_is_pissed_that_i_want_to_take_another/,"The girl is my sisters best friend since middle school (almost 20 years).  And she doesn't want her family to know about the abortion, so she asked my sister for help (my sister lives on the west coast and friend lives on the east coast).

My sister calls me up and asks me if I can drive her to a clinic, and I said 'sure'.  I see this as helping out family.  My sister needs me to help her best friend.  When I tell my gf about it, she seems alright with it, at first. But then she said that she needs to talk to me saying that she feels uncomfortable with me taking her since my gf doesn't the girl; asking why couldn't the potential father take her, etc. She was even dabbling in the thought that this could possibly be *my* kid and that I'm trying to make her look like a fool.  I convinced her otherwise.  We get into this big argument.

I finally told my gf that I would talk to my sister to see if there are other people that can take her.  But RA, if my sister tells me to do something like this for her, I feel it's obvious that she trusts me with this and I don't want to let her down. But in the same time I dont want to feel insensitive to what my gf is feeling/saying.  Advice is much needed.  Thank you.

**edit:**

All day yesterday I had been thinking of the situation.  And also, all of you guys really helped me think this through, **thank you**.  I had been thinking of all these arguments and basic rationality.  **I AM DOING NOTHING WRONG.**  I already thought of what I was going to say,  *""That's it.  We're done talking about this.  I'm helping out my sister.  If you don't like it, tough shit.  And if this continues to be a problem, we're done.""*  

Before I could even tell her,  she calls me later last night, and told me that she loved me and that she's sorry.  She told me that she talked to her sister and realized that she was wrong.

And I know this doesn't mean that all the crazy is out of her, not by a long shot.  But I feel that I have to give it my best shot to make this relationship work.  I want to help her with her problems, but also, not to a point where I hate/resent her.  I know it'd be easier if I dumped her, but I have to know that I gave it my all.

Again, thank you all for your comments.  I can't believe that I had doubted myself there for a bit. Thank you.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_kuegk,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kuegk/girlfriend_is_pissed_that_i_want_to_take_another/,

We are supposed to get married in couple months and she cheated on me. Normally I am in the dump the cheater camp, but there are extenuating circumstances, I want to know if I am just being blind or if this really can be forgiven.

We have a long distance relationship; I am finishing up a degree on the other side of the country. My Fiancée went out drinking to a company bar night. I had been distracted by schoolwork and we had just had a little tiff about me not talking to her enough. Anyway she hadn't eaten all day and proceeds to get extremely smashed. The night goes on and the friends she came with ended up hooking up and leaving. Her boss offered her a ride home, but they ended up at his house having sex. She called me the first thing next morning, crying and begging for forgiveness. 

She is very honest about everything, and insists it wasn't rape but that it never would have happened if she was sober. For the past few months she had been calling me telling me that she had crush on her supervisor, and felt really guilty about it. I shrugged it off cause they were just stray thoughts and I didn't think she would ever cheat on me. but 'sober thoughts are drunk actions'

I am very hurt by this, and yet I think I will be able to forgive her some day. Only because she was drunk, and she was completely honest about it. I still trust her to be honest, but my trust in her faithfulness is shaken. I made her transfer departments and she has since quit that job. I've made her give up drinking for the time being. We've also signed up for premarital counselling.

Am I being to lenient? Am I just being a sucker? Will I ever be able to trust her again? Does once a cheater always a cheater apply here?",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_c4n15,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c4n15/fiancée_cheated_on_me_while_drunk_with_her_boss/,

..Edit: He liked mostly psychedelics..but had mephedrone , something else like it..&amp; cocaine i guess . sad thing was he sent me a video on sept 7th ( http://www.mediafire.com/?9nsq2ycb2y26n26) since he thought he was od ing on coke of him flushing quite a bit of bindles n bags &amp; a pill?( toilets gross sorry) &amp; he said he was done. He was sober &amp; we were together until the 24th of sept as far as i know, till when I left to move to Dallas . I begged him to let me stay with him &amp; or to come with me. He just kept making excuses to stay..He wasn't done yet. He died on thurs &amp; I couldn't get ahold of him..I sent the cops last night &amp; they found him with narcotics so i think he just did them &amp; died bc he would usually put it away...This is killing me.He was coming to Dallas next weekend &amp; bought tickets to the Jim Jeffries show.I can't believe he's not coming..We grew closer than ever since I left..Talked more. I'm so glad we were happy, on good terms &amp; we Loved eachother when it happened. He's my Heart.

Edit: I really dont know what he had this time..he only told me some of what he flushed.They are doing an autopsies &amp; investigation. I will keep everyone posted.

EDIT: &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So check it out..stuff like this is what's happening now, say I go somewhere like to a store that I been to since I been here &amp; now since he's been gone, when I go back to that store...I find myself saying to myself 'Aaron was alive when I was here last time'...Like I put on some fucking shorts even &amp; say to myself 'I wore these last week when Aaron was alive' etc. &amp; I remember how I felt good last week when he was alive knowing how he was in the world at that time but I don't feel that good feeling anymore. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I was talking to my niece who I'm staying with &amp; she's churchy. I believe in God/higher power &amp; science. I believe in spirits &amp; ufos both of which I seen. I believe that there's a fine thread that can tie everything together &amp; that nothing is impossible. She said 'God brought you here for a reason bc you need family &amp; if you stayed in San Antonio this would've happened &amp; it would've been a million times worse bc it would just be you and your daughter, you would've found Aaron/BF yourself'. Which is true probably. 

NOW&gt;&gt;&gt;My question is about the belief in spirits...I was in a car accident once &amp; should've died &amp; when it happened I felt my deceased mothers presence &amp; I felt warm &amp; her holding me &amp; I only came out with a couple scrapes, totally conscious &amp; the car was totalled. ....I want him to come to me... touch me..show me a sign. My niece said spirits on earth are really demons trying to trick you. Don't ask Aaron to come back here he left/was taken for a reason. Let him be at peace. I think when people die unexpected they can go into shock &amp; can end up staying here by choice bc they can't believe they died &amp; they know someone's waiting for them at home or they were trying to get to someone &amp; something happened on the way there &amp; they don't want to leave Loved ones/unfinished business w.out closure.... Aaron died &amp; I'm sure he couldn't believe it was happening at the time &amp; I was the last thing he thought of when he died. He knew I would be mad, he knew he was supposed to come &amp; I'd be angry,freaking out &amp; disappointed if he didn't. ..I feel I felt him since ..Idk know am I crazy?..Is that bad?
Does anyone have any experience with this..am I wrong to think/feel this?

&gt;&gt;EDIT&gt;&gt;&gt;It never rains here..&amp; since Fri its been overcast &amp; been pouring the past 2 days. I went outside &amp; said 'Aarons crying.'.. please look at new pics of him above.
Ok,This is weird, I just thought about it..He had a premonition of his own death...
on Tues the 4th (He died on Thurs the 6th)
He texted me &amp; said 1:16 ""I fell asleep around 8, babe I was tired"".. 1:19 AM ""Babe I had a horrible nightmare..I crashed in a small plane &amp; died it was awful.""
I texted right back ""*:) .. poor tired boy. NOOOO BB!! NO CRASH!! NO SMALL PLANES FOR U!!""
I believe the metaphor for the small plane was it was his mind when he was on the drugs &amp; he crashed &amp; died.
When I talked to him the later that day he said ""Babe that dream was awful, it was scary."" I said ""Babe,why were you in a plane? ..You hate planes?lol"" He laughed &amp; said ""Idk..I guess I was being Randy Rhodes in my dream:P""
BC We were just talking &amp; he asked me like a week later about how Randy Rhodes died.

&amp; Idk why but when we were together a month or 2 before this he sent me a reddit link showing coffins on sale online from Walmart. We were at my house &amp; we started talking about if we wanted to be buried or cremated laughing lightly joking saying what songs we wanted played at our funeral even &amp; I'm angry bc I can't remember what song he wanted played:( but was happy..He said he wanted everyone to party &amp; be happy at his funeral.
I know his death was accidental though.This is just coincidence.

&gt;&gt;&gt;I just want to say how I'm feeling from you guys its really overwhelming ...I never thought I'd get these responses &amp; that I'm so glad this medium exists. I'm so happy, feel so much better that ALL of you have reached out with this comfort from everywhere, its truly touched my heart. I never felt so much Love &amp; support ever.
I'm eternally Grateful.

For well over a year and half, we had an absolutely wonderful relationship, border-lining on the kind of epic grandness found only in fiction. I said a few weeks before I met her (after a string of tumultuous relationships that just kind of happened) that I wasn't going to find myself in a relationship again until I couldn't help but be there. It wouldn't be because I was trying to be with someone. It would be because I'd found someone so deeply compatible with me that I'd be with her whether I was looking for it or not. I had no idea how close she was.

There were sparks and romance and adoration and entirely too much clingyness from each of us. And it never, ever went away. That honeymoon phase, that phase in a new relationship where you constantly think about each other... it matured, but we still give each other butterflies and it's been over two years now.

This is not to say that everything was perfect. We hurt each other quite badly at times. But whatever happened, we got through it with blatant honesty, by assuming the best about one another, and by committing to staying together and becoming even stronger.

Nobody else I've ever met holds a candle to her. I'm crazy in love with her, and I've never doubted she feels the same.

But we may have come across a Kobayashi Maru -- a no-win scenario.

She's bisexual, and has known and accepted that since she was a teenager. (We met when I was almost 23 and she was almost 22.) And aside from a handful of times when she'd be VERY much in a girl mood and I wasn't exactly capable of fulfilling that, it wasn't something that hampered us. If anything, mutually fantasizing over girls let us have MORE fun, haha.

But it's that bisexuality that's keeping her from totally understanding where I'm coming from lately, and is it ever a doozy.

Back in November, she started spending a lot of time online, apparently doing an experiment about gender roles in society. She'd set up both a male and female persona, and judge the community's reaction to similar circumstances in both roles.

What she found was that in the male persona, the way people reacted to her and treated her was far, far more in line with how she saw herself and how she WANTED people to see her. As she did more research and found more information and read more personal accounts of trans people, she kept seeing relatable patterns in her own life.

Eventually, she came to the conclusion that she was, in fact, a man in a woman's body.

Thus the no-win scenario for us. I'm undeniably straight. And if I wasn't so close and so in love with this person, it would be simple for me to call him by a different name, use different pronouns. It'd be no big deal at all.

Alas, I am in love.

Every time he talks about getting testosterone, my heart just sinks. I'm ambivalent at best toward his new name, but seeing HER name makes me smile every time I do. Basically, we've reached a point where what makes him happy makes me incredibly uncomfortable, and vice-versa. Even just referring to him AS a him hurts.

Nothing's changed physically yet, and my brain still sees a girl and still feels the same way as ever. We were talking about it earlier, and she said, ""Why did it have to be you? Why did you have to see me as I am as being so perfect and so wonderful?"" And she's right. She was absolutely perfect for me.

But this is not something either of us can change. As Lady Gaga said, we were born this way. I don't want to lose her, but I've already lost HER. And we both want to be together, but I don't know what to do.

tl;dr: My girlfriend of over two years has realized that s/he's a man in a woman's body. I am attracted only to women.

EDIT: My partner made a comment in response to a lot of what we're seeing. A lot of people quite fairly figured this was just a case of her seeing how she might be treated as a man, and wanting that. Fair because I really didn't go into the specifics of HOW the decision was made, and if that was all you had to go on, it might make for a reasonable conclusion. I'll post the comment here for visibility:

""Okay, I am the partner mentioned above. I think it's necessary to clear some things up for some of who you just cannot seem to get what I am really going through. I didn't just go online an suddenly decide I wanted to be a guy. Come on people. Surely you know no one is that stupid. -.- I mean really. I'm in my mid 20's and this is something I've been dealing with since before puberty.

I've had gender issues since long before I did that project. I had been wrestling with things for years and I didn't have the resources to understand a lot of it. I had been a guy online for years prior because of what I thought was a easier social environment. Being a guy was nothing new. I have never been ""girly"" by nature. I used to pass a boy when I was little, until my mom would come and force me to wear a dress and tell people i was a girl. I hated it. Over time I tried to be a girl, went overboard with it, wore makeup, high heels, tried to talk the way they do, but I was never happy. Relationships were weird, people always reacted to me in ways I couldn't understand, and in the end I said fuck it. For years now I've been the tomboyish Rainbow Dash type of person I felt I was since I was a child. I have always preferred women sexually to men, but I relate to men so much better than I do women that I found myself dating them more often. I never let my orientation get in the way of my gender. I like both sexes and that doesn't make me any less of a man or woman. It is what it is.

When I met my current partner I was lucky as fuck. This man is as nerdy as I am. He gets me. He didn't ask me to be more feminine, he didn't expect me to speak in code, he didn't mind that I'd had more sexual partners than him, or that I curse like a bloody sailor. I have never been happier.

After I started the social experiment online, which I did for a school project, I discovered some things about myself, things I had not wanted to face for years out of fear of losing the life I had built for myself. I freaked out. I fought the urge to run away and started doing research on gender identity. I felt instantly that I was like a man in a woman's body, but I was terrified to say it. I identified as gender queer for a few months. I tried to reach out to other people, sought counseling. I couldn't find anyone in my area to help me. One of my old friends reached out to me after seeing my posts. He was now becoming a she and wanted to give me some advice. I found her words to be more than helpful. After that I knew the only reason I was trying to say I was gender queer was because I was afraid of losing my lover. That wasn't healthy for me. I am not going to go jumping into this like an idiot. I'm still researching and I'm still trying to find an appropriate therapist. The surgeries I need are expensive, and I am broke. I'm going to have to spend years earning the money I need, on top of trying to finish college and make find a place to live. This isn't a whim I got on, or some fun social game for me to do like a teenager trying to escape into a new identity. This is serious shit people. I'm aware of that. 

Trust me.

I love my partner, and I want to make this work. He's been here with me through things no one else was, not even my closest friends. I fucking love that trekkie bastard. I will not be making any physical changes anytime remotely soon. All I am doing is easing my partner into the reality of the future. I don't want him to get hurt any more than is already unavoidable. I personally doubt we can past this, but at the same time, he has surprised me many times. I am not going to expect anything. I am going to go through what I have to and hope he comes along with me. It's asking a lot, but I wouldn't ask if I didn't think he was worth it.""",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1369443357.0,,,True,t3_1eym15,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1eym15/im_a_straight_dude_25m_who_is_quickly_finding_my/,

I've been asked for a followup on my experience with a mmf threesome. With my fiancee, I had been talked into a mmf threesome in return for a mff threesome. Instead of having ""one last fling"" before marriage, my fiancee and I thought this would be a good idea. We had dated exclusively for 3 years and had no outside involvement during. When presented with the idea of a threesome, I was interested, but she insisted that I be open to a threesome with another guy. It eventually became a must, and we would have a threesome with another guy, then later with another girl, just to be equal. I had never had any experience with another guy prior, I suspect she had some same-sex experience prior, but she never admitted to me. So, the idea of having sex with her hot friend and her outweighed the potential horror of doing another dude. We figured it wasn't cheating if we went together and I was a good sport about it. 
[Yes, I had sex with another guy. Oral, anal, gave and received. Over a night and morning. With her present.]

Afterwards, I noticed that she would make comments or subtle digs to me regarding what I'd done, and slowly the subtlety wore off. The return favor of the night with her friend (the mff) seemed to be put off indefinitely. 

At this point, my mind began spinning; I didn't know if I was hearing it correctly, being oversensitive or over-reacting, but I seemed to notice a change between us and in our mutual friends. I began to wonder about her. Eventually, I insisted on our deal; so we went out with her friend, the experience was beyond humiliating (details if needed) and we had a huge fight the next day. ""Blah, blah, blah, it'll never work, you're way more into guys, you'd rather that, ... I can't see myself with you ..."" I kept trying to remind her of the good times, she began bringing up what others think, I asked her if she had told others, she says 'maybe' ... it was a freaking mess. I wanted her to calm down, maybe we'd cool off in awhile, but she moved out the next day. We've had very little contact since then. And most of our mutual friends have sided with her.

We have been quite serious for some time now and both love each other very much. Our most recent fight regarding this happened last night where she asked me to give up masturbation for lent. I naturally said no, not because I don't think I could do it, but I think it's pointless to put myself through that...plus I'm not religious so I don't really care about lent. (she's not religious either so that's not the issue). After that, she went on to say how it bothers her that I masturbate because it makes her feel like she's inadequate and it makes our sex life suffer (we already do it pretty often but I still find time to fap once in a while. we don't live together either) because she doesn't feel like doing it when she knows I can get the same outcome on my own. She said this has always bothered her with past boyfriends and that it has with me the whole time, she just says she can't put up with it anymore. I guess what I'm asking is if I'm wrong and/or stupid for throwing away my relationship with my girlfriend. It looks like I chose fapping over my girlfriend and it's not like that. I just don't think I could make the promise to never do it again and I don't think I should even have to make that promise to begin with.

I come to ask for relationship advice, but not the way I ever imagined to. Let me tell you a short story (please bear with me - I swear I'm not trolling and I hope someone can hear me.)


Let me tell you something about myself. I'm 33 this year and my life so far has been uneventful and unremarkable. I go to work every day. I come home at night. I pay my bills. I have two great parents and two great siblings and we all get together every weekend. Both my siblings are married and with kids. I love my nephews and nieces and hope to find someone special to start a family with sometime soon. 


Oh, it's not like I haven't been looking for that special someone. My romantic life has had its Ups and Downs. Every time I fall in love, I do so with all my heart and soul and hope for the best. I still remember most of my past relationships with fondness and a tinge of wistfulness. 


I remember this girl I dated back in College. She was so pretty and so beautiful. We were *perfect* together. She loved me and I loved her and we made such plans like only lovestruck college kids can. But like most college kids, eventually we struck a difficult patch and not enough maturity on each other's part and we separated after 2 years together. It took me a long time - years in fact - before I got completely over her. But I did and I moved on with my life.


Her mother contacted me last week. 


Skin cancer is a horrible, evil disease. It took her life 4 months ago, though she struggled with it for almost 2 years. I never even knew (we both agreed to not contact each other). The news hit me like a ton of bricks. Even now my mind refuses to think she's gone - that this is a mistake. I visited her grave a few days ago and cried along with her mother and father - bitter tears of regret that I never contacted her in these past 8 years. I miss her so much. And I'm also incredibly **angry** with her. 


A week ago, I learnt that I have been a father to a little girl of 8.


No, strike that. I've **not** been a father. I wasn't there when she was born. I did not see her take her first steps. I did not teach her anything. I've lived these past 8 years not knowing she even existed. But that's how her mother wanted it. And so I never even knew until last week. We've met twice. I wish I could show you her. She is so very beautiful. She reminds me so much of her mother. And she's smart too. But she's also very sad and scared of me. And I'm very, very scared of her too.


I don't know how to be a father. I didn't even know I was a father. In my heart, I'm still a stupid little boy who loves videogames and scifi movies and roadtrips. What am I going to do? I can't even *think* how I can make things right for this little girl - my daughter - that won't end up with me fucking it all up. I haven't told my family about this. I haven't told anyone. I've been sitting at home, going to the cemetery and visiting my daughter and her grandparents, thinking about how to proceed. For now, we've agreed that it would be wrong to subject her to any further stress by putting her in an unfamiliar and frightening situation: she's staying right where she is, with her maternal grandparents. And I've not worked up the courage or even the right words to tell her who I am. How does one even explain this to a bright 8 year old? Will she hate me? Her Mother? I don't know what to do and I feel so alone. I *want* to tell my parents, but I don't know what they'll think of me. I want to ask my brother for help. Mostly, I just want to cry. I feel so helpless.   

How do I even begin to forge a relationship with a daughter I've never met?
--------------------------------------
**EDIT:** Sorry folks. I posted this pretty late at night and sleep got the best of me. I want to thank you all for your words of wisdom and support. 

I understand that there are many things I need to do and put in order before I dive headfirst into this. I need to settle the question of Paternity of this child without a shadow of a doubt if I intend to be a father to her and to seek custody in the future. But I will proceed under the assumption that she is my daughter as at the moment I don't have any reason to doubt my exgirlfriend's word or just the logistics around this (the dates match). I have made plans to meet once more with the grandparents at the cemetery this morning (Saturday here) and I will ask them afterwards if they consent to a Paternity test to make things legal (they in fact suggested something similar earlier - I didn't think much about this then, but now I see why I should. I've only had a week to think on this - they've had thebest part of 8 years and they understand thsi better than I can right now). Next, I'm going to tell my daughter what I intend to do and why I'm doing it. I think my biggest hangup was thinking how to 'dumb it down' or 'sugarcoat' it. I now intend to tell her straight out without any resentment or anger and explain to her who I think am to her and she how she accepts it.


After that, I'm going to meet with my sister the following day. She is the most Neutral one of us and if it all goes well, I'll then look at how I tell my parents about this and explain to them what I intend to do. I don't intend to uproot this little girl from her everyday space or drag her away from the only family she's known. Fuck that. That girl will not suffer any more if I can help it. 


And for those of you who have suggested I seek professional help. That I **will** do early next week. I will find out what my rights are in this situation and what I need to do to exercise those rights if it comes to it. I need to come to terms with my shellshock and grief ASAP, so I'm going to see a counsellor next week at the earliest. Finally, I'm going to talk to as many of her friends and family as I can and to put together a picture of who my exgirlfriend was outside of being a mother to my child. I realise that 8 years is a long time and that my daughter knew her far longer than I ever did. I need to catch up)

They say paternity tests take 4 to 6 weeks. That's a long time to ponder 'what if'. I will let you all know how this goes. Thanks.

    And to those who think it was silly to rely on the Reddit Hivemind: I agree with you mostly, but I also see
    great benefit in drawing in the advice of well-intentioned and wise people and parents who can help me
    with their experiences and encouragement. Sometimes, it takes a kind word from a stranger to snap a guy
    like me from his shellshock. So thank you all.

My Fiancée was having cold feet the night before and we were talking through it. Her concern was that she felt she was at 90% of loving me and was worried that during the hard times, which come in every marriage, would she wonder if she had made the right decision in marrying me. 

The next morning we had picked up the conversation and were talking it all out when her mother told her the good news: The nice man at the tent place was kind enough to give her deposit back in full! annnnnnd thats how she broke the news to my Fiancée  that the wedding was cancelled and she had gotten all of her deposits back from the band,caterer, tent and chair co., etc. 

She said she did it because my Fiancée had doubts. Doubts which I feel were planted by the mother and aunt who have been telling my Fiancée for the last 6 months that I wasn't good enough and that she doesn't love me as much as an EX from 7 years ago. 

Now, if we choose to get married her parents have said they will have no part in it. My Fiancée will never get her moment in the spotlight for a bridal shower, or a batchlorette party, or being walked down the aisle. We have had to contact the 200 some odd people that were coming to our wedding and tell them its cancelled and she is still not sure that she loves me the 100% that she thinks she should. 

All of this has happened while I have been out of town on a business trip and I don't return for a week. When I get home she wants to discuss what we should do in person i.e. do we want to get married? do we want to stay together? What are we going to do?

I love her with all of my heart and I have tried to give her everything she wants, take care of her, be romantic for her, and show her I love her everyday. I am ready to get married and I don't know that I can wait any longer. 

So I ask you reddit, what should I do with my situation?

This was 13 years ago. We have been through the highest highs and the lowest lows together.

When we were about 18 I cheated (3 month relationship with a girl), and did not know what I wanted in life. It was a huge mistake that I regret with every ounce of my soul. But I did it and I can only be sorry.

Fast forward to today or the last 5-6 years. Every 3 months, she cheats on me (3 times total), holds the cheating against me, or just destroys our relationship with extremely terrible judgement and self destructive behavior.

Now, I am a good looking guy. I make middle 6-figures a year. It is a 1 minute walk to the ocean from my condo. I live the dream life. There is nothing standing in my way. I am a good looking late 20s guy that makes a good living, loves kids and dogs, with a condo on the beach. On a dating profile that sounds great.

However, I love this girl more than I love myself. I go to bars and girls hit on me. Finding a new girl is not an issue. I love this girl.

Now to the problem. I have zero self esteem. I think I am worth absolutely nothing. I think that I don't even deserve her love. I am completely lost. I could be fine with out her. But I will never let her go. We have spent so many years, through thick and thin. It seems impossible to just give up now.

Please someone, give me some amazing advice that makes this go away. That makes it go either way. With her or without her. I just need to fix this, because it is getting really rough.

EDIT: We live in Mexico currently and have lived here for the past year. Kicking her out is harder than just changing the locks etc. I edited the above a bit because the cheating became a focal point because I worded it poorly. Cheating is not the issue. Cheating is maybe 3rd on the list of reasons this is ending. 

You guys have given amazing advice, better than I could have hoped for. I will keep this updated as to what happens. It is truly amazing to post something and just a few hours later, have a whole different outlook on things. Reddit is amazing.

EDIT again: There are too many people to respond to and so much great advice. I do want to say, to the majority of advice given. We have a ridiculous open line of communication between the two of us, we have no secrets. And I express the sentiments of 95% of things posted here to her daily. I tell her so many of things you guys are talking about, so many things = too many to list. And I use almost identical wording. It is eye opening/enlightening to actually realize I am not crazy. That there is a problem...and it might not be my fault. Thanks again everyone

EDIT3: Didn't expect to get this many responses. But I have to keep adding things, because it keeps becoming more complicated. I did leave her 3 years ago. I moved 2k miles away. I just packed my things, and I left with zero notice. After about 1 month of no contact, I could not get her out of my mind, I called her one evening and just told her I loved her and I missed smelling her (sounds creepy when I type it). 5 hours later she was at my door and I was surprised beyond belief.

The seduction community creates broken men who see women as a figure and a goal and there are no end to the issues that it causes for the small benefit that it offers.

Why is the relationship advice subreddit linking to another sub that does nothing but lead to relationship problems? Seems a bit counter-intuitive.

Relationship advice seems to be all about teaching people to interact in an adult way (empathy, compromise, self-respect) and solve their problems in an adult manner. Seduction is all about ""the game"" and little tricks that are no basis for a relationship at all and most certainly lead to problems down the line.

**e:** Oh look a mass influx of downvotes. I wonder why *some unknown group* is downvoting a *question*. Could it be that the answer doesn't paint such a positive light?

**e2:** Since there are so many claims that i'm cherry picking I decided to head to the sidebar for advice given directly by the sub. 


Oh hey look a [glossary](http://www.fastseduction.com/acronyms.shtml) of terms recommended by r/seduction. Let's see what we can find, shall we?

&gt; *Bitch Shield:* Not a derogatory term - used to describe a behavior women use when attempting to fend of would-be suitors. Usually in use in clubs, bars, and other pick up places. Sometimes just referred to as a ""shield"".

Intriguing choice of terminology. I guess fending off unwanted advances is a bit bitchy, in some people's eyes.

&gt; *DDB:* ""Doggy Dinner Bowl"" [Look] - The look on a chick's face when she's tranced out or lapping up your words with a phased out look in their eyes. In that state, they are metaphorically ready to eat out of the palm of your hand.

Welp, i generally refer to people whom i respect with animal terminology. Yeah, that sound pretty healthy to me.

&gt; *VC:* 	Victim Chick. A chick which comes with a lot of emotional baggage (possibly of past abuse) who gives guys the opportunity to be a rescuer, feel like a hero, feel loved and vitally important in an intense way. Quite often, you'll hear this type of girl say ""I've never told anyone this..."" when talking about her messed up past.

Indeed, let's learn to classify and find these chicks so that we can learn to seek them out and fulfill our fantasies of Templar.

I could go on if you'd like.

**e3:** How could i have forgotten kino? Ah, this is certainly a fun party trick to use on a complete stranger, bold is mine.

*Kino:* Kinesthetic approach (physical touching). Usually of a sexual nature, **to get a woman in a state of approval and arousal.** Touching and stroking the side of her arm, her elbows, stroking her hair, cheeks, stroking her hand or wrist, etc

**e4:** Since spin control squad keeps screaming ""The link isn't seddit"" I'll point out again for the hard of reading, that link is one of the first in seddits welcoming sidebar. I didn't track it down randomly off the internet, it's one of the first things you'll read in their welcome info section.

I definitely don't want to hurt her feelings, but she's making herself progressively less attractive to me.  Help!

PS:  This isn't a straw-poll, so please don't downvote me just because you like tattoos on girls.  

**EDIT:**  We  talked about this over breakfast, and it went better than I could have hoped.  I took the advice to be honest and straight-forward, and her response surprised me.  Part of the reason why she kept getting more tattoos was that she thought they were a turn-on for me. I'd always responded positively (or at least pretended to) when she came home with a new one, and not being a mind-reader, she had no way of knowing my real opinion.  It turns out she's getting a bit bored of getting new ones anyway.  She wants to get at least one more to fill in a gap, and get a crappy one re-done, but that's probably going to be the end of her tattooing for now.  This discussion also led into a talk about our deeper feelings for each other, and about our longer term plans.  We're closer now than ever.  

TL;DR:  Honesty definitely *is* the best policy in a relationship.

If you don’t want to read it all, just gimme an upvote so someone else will. I really need help.

Backstory:
I’m married, 3 years in, 8 years total relationship time. We’re in our mid 20s. My wife is the only serious relationship I have ever had; I had other ‘girlfriends’ in early highschool but nothing sexual. We’re living together, both working, own a condo, two cars, have a pretty close earning level. No kids, though we’ve talked about them around our 30s. On paper, everything’s fine.

I don’t know if she thinks everything is fine – she might! - but certainly we both do a good job pretending that it is. I know I pretend that everything’s fine, but inside I think I want to get out of it…. but I’m still not sure.

Why would I want out?

Well, for starters, it’s pretty much a sexless marriage. There are a lot of factors that contribute to this – whether we’re both feeling good, whether our schedules line up, whether we’re in a good mood, etc. But, be that as it may, it has translated to me having sex perhaps once every two months at best.

I’ll admit that I don’t really ask for it anymore, but I think that’s because I’ve been turned down too many times and I’m not particularly interested in putting it out there anymore. It was once hot and passionate, sex in my car or in a park or covertly in our parents’ houses, but since we’ve been living together it’s been pretty bland, unless I put a lot of effort into it… mostly, she just lies there. I enjoy performing oral, which she seems to appreciate, but rarely if ever have I received it in return.

She’s a good-looking girl, but sadly I have to admit that I don’t really feel much desire for her anymore. She takes pains to look good when she’s going out somewhere, but around the house she wears nothing but the dowdiest clothes, and is sometimes lax about her hygiene. She has no interest in exercising whatsoever and instead coasts on her fast metabolism, which is slowing over the years – it’s not a sustainable way to keep her appearance, and I worry that without a change in the next few years, she’ll never manage to be in good shape. 

I don’t think my lack of desire for her is necessarily connected to how she looks, because she’s still very pretty and not at all fat – I just don’t really view her as a sexual being anymore. I love her, but she’s almost like a roommate with shared accounts and some authority over me. She could probably put on some racy lingerie and get me turned on, if she wanted to, but it doesn’t happen. So I’ve given up on that front.

To add to this, she’s stressed out all the time. She works a job that can be very trying, and I appreciate that, and I’ve listened to her rants when she comes home. Ultimately, though, they end up being about the same sort of issues over and over again, and there comes a point when I can no longer try to make her feel better about them when it’s clear they’re not going anywhere. Instead, her stress just makes me stressed, and we end up feeding back on each other, and arguing about things that shouldn’t be argued about. 

Now, I know that as a man it’s my tendency to want to give advice rather than to just be an emotional sounding board, but honestly I’ve tried every approach I can and now I’m at the point where I really just don’t want to have to deal with that anymore.
I’ve even commented before that we’re always arguing about petty things, and that it’s bad for us, but it never ends the fight. To top it off, these arguments most often happen late at night when I’m tired. I virtually always capitulate because I know she’ll stay in the fight longer than I will and that it’s better for me to just end it early by losing as gracefully as I can. Of course, when you lose to get out of a fight, it’s not like you’ve actually given up your opinions – you’ve just apologized your way out of the situation. The problem remains.

On another note, she doesn’t really have many friends. She used to, but the “work” of calling them to hang out was too much, and she let a lot of them go through lack of maintenance of the relationship. She does still have a core group of girls, but they get together once every two months, max. She gets along with my core group of friends well, and their girlfriends, but never calls them to hang out.

Why is this important? Well, with no exercise and very little socializing, all she does when she comes home from work is complain about stuff for a while, and then sit on the computer all night “unwinding”. At least she’s not playing an MMO or anything, mostly just reading forums, but it results in a life that’s got to be ridiculously monotonous and stressful. 

My suggestions to find things to do (Take yoga! Go swimming! Paint a picture! Walk! Bike! Run! Hike! Go to our free condo gym! Call your friends and hang out!) are always met with criticism or “meh”. I’m willing to have us shell out whatever money it takes for her to find an interesting activity to do, and I’ve told her that, but there hasn’t been anything. She doesn’t really have any passion.
 
I go hang out with friends, I stay late at work, I go for long hikes; I find myself finding things to do without her. I’ll admit that some of that is to avoid her, which has increased as of late. But the vast majority is because she either doesn’t want to go along, or if I bring her I will have to babysit her all night and I won’t have any fun.

For example, I got tickets to see a pretty incredible DJ some weeks ago, and ended up getting her a ticket too. Unfortunately, that meant that instead of me dancing and having fun, we sat at a table in the corner of the club all night, not really drinking, not really talking, mostly just moping with nothing to do. Few things are more depressing to me than being a wallflower for no reason. 

I think that I’m a good husband, from a practical standpoint. I work, I pay my bills, I stay in shape, I’m nice to her and compliment her, I tell her that I love her. Every morning, I make her breakfast and help her get her things in order, and when I get home I tidy up any mess from the morning before she gets home. I do all of the ‘hard’ chores, all of the “man’s work”, and most of the large-scale cleanup tasks that require a lot of time and effort to do. I also do half of the kitchen work and domestic chores, and all my own laundry. Yet, I still get nagged for the tiniest things that don’t matter. She likes to pick a particular (usually benign) habit of mine that bothers her, nag me about it until I change to her method, and then move on to another issue of mine to “fix”. 

I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this and keep putting on a façade that Everything’s Okay before I crack and make a mess of it all.

I just keep feeling that I’m in the prime of my life – I look good, I’m in good shape, I’m confident, and I have a ton of friends – including single women. I have decent earning power and skills, and I love talking to people… couldn’t I probably find someone that I’d actually be happy with? Someone who I’d look forward to coming home to? 

And if that’s true, the longer I wait, the more of my time - and her time - I’m wasting. The pool of sane, smart, sexy women that are still single in my age range drops every year. If I wait until I’m 35 and have two kids to do this, it’ll be the biggest mistake of my life. I don’t know if I can do sixty-odd years of this when it feels pretty damn rough already.

Yeah, we need couple’s counseling badly, but how do I even bring that up with no context? Like I said, as far as I know, she doesn’t know I feel this way. How the fuck do I even explain any of this without putting her massively on the defensive? How can I deal with the emotions she’d feel if I told her any of this? I still love her, but I don’t know if I want to be with her.

Help me, somehow, please.

Firstly, I apologize for not posting an update sooner.  Over the past 2 weeks not much has happened, but I was asked to post an update so here goes.

The day after the OP my boyfriend (Ted) called the owner of the apartment downstairs (Paul).  He wanted to give them both as many chances as possible to knock it off before we went to the board, especially since Ted has always had a good relationship with Paul in the past.

First Ted asked if Paul gave his number to her.  When he said yes, Ted said he would have appreciated it if he asked him first.  Then he informed Paul about the voice mail and that she's been calling security on us nonstop and that he's sure that what she hears as ""banging"" is just us walking around the apartment.  Ted asked that he talk to the woman because if this continues, we'll be going to the board.

I spoke to 2 police officer friends of mine and they both said there's really nothing we can do involving the police and the best thing is to go to the board.

A few hours after Ted talked to Paul, Paul called back saying he spoke to her.  He said he told her the walls and floors are thin and that she's hearing us walking and that's it.  He told her if she keeps it up and gets him in trouble she's going to be gone.  Ted also told him that if things get too loud, she can call or text him but he will not tolerate the level of disrespect he got on the voice mail she left.  Paul understood, assured us it wouldn't happen again and that was that.

The same day, when Ted was coming home from work he got a call from the building's superintendent.  He called to tell Ted that she went to him basically fishing for info about our apartment... asking if it was really covered with 80% carpet.  The super basically told her it's none of her business.  He also told Ted that there have been other complaints about her and he's hoping she won't be here for much longer.

Lastly, a few days after that, while Ted was trying to take a nap he heard her talking on the phone saying things like ""I heard the tv at 1 am"" and ""I think I've made a horrible mistake.

So there you have it.  So far, no other problems.

I think she was just a good actor. This was by far my best relationship ever, and I really felt that she felt the same way. We just had so much fun together, it was like we were two great friends with so much more.

We moved in together after about a year, and things were still good. We hit some minor issues here and there, but nothing we couldn't talk about and work out. We never had a really big fight.

Well, I feel like we are moving toward marriage. My career is going well, I just got a promotion, make great money, and am tall, great skin tone, and I'm told that I'm handsome. I cringe typing it because I'm not the arrogant egotistical type, but it's the truth, and it sounds really cocky. 

Anyway, for this girl I abandoned the much more free spirited lifestyle I had and adopted a lifestyle that I hear most girls love. And I became focused on the future of our unit, which I hoped I would one day call a family.

A few months back, I decided that it was time to buy a house. So together, we went on the house hunt, went through the emotional ups and downs of that process, found a great house that we both absolutely loved, and bought it. We move in, things are going well. Then this weekend, a bomb gets dropped. ""I want to be single and date around again."" Which I interpret as ""I've met someone else, so fuck you and your house."" We even had the talk before we bought the house about whether it was a good idea or not. We agreed that it was a forever relationship.

Luckily, I'm not an idiot. I bought the house in my name, and picked one that I could afford on my own should something like this happen. However, the house is big, with a big yard and will take a bunch of work. And here I am...newly single in a half empty house and noone to share it with. Want to talk about being bitter? 

Tell me reddit....how is it possible that women can go around bitching about ""no good men"" and yet when some of us try to go and do the right thing, we get kicked in the nuts? How can I get over this bitterness? I really don't want to scare away a future great girl because of this experience. For context, I just turned 30, and she was 31.  

EDIT: Thanks for all the great feedback, as well as the ""skin tone"" cracks. I tried to figure out a way to say tall dark and handsome without sounding like an ass. Well, I sounded even more like an ass I guess. 

EDIT2: by ""abandoned the much more free spirited lifestyle"" I meant that in regards to being the stereotypical douche bag guy that treats girls like crap/screws around/parties, etc. I didn't change who I was or my enjoyment of life.

Now I'm just a human who sits in front of the warm glow of his monitor spreading a very awkward first hand experience with the world.

You see, I just got thrown out of a gal's house by her bf. We met each other a few months ago and despite knowing she is attached we went on our merry ways. We did all these in full knowledge of the existence of that other guy. It was so easy... to be doing all the things lovers do when that guy seemed so far away. She was very unhappy with her relationship and had made it very clear to both of us. 

Today she invited me to her house and cuddled on her bed. She had her shirt and bra off and we cuddled for a bit and as usual, no sex. I knew I should have waited. At least untill she had a proper break off with the bf. BF stormed her house, found us in her bed and proceeded to give me a series of punches in the head. Caught in this situation we had so merrily ignored, she didn't know how to react - but I did. Inside, I admit to being the third party in their relationship and so the next natural thing to do is to let that guy pound me screaming his heart out.

Man that felt bad. I realised at that moment that the guy was very REAL. Alive and breathing with emotions. He asked me to get out of his sight in which I did, muttering 'you two settle this' on my way out. She is bound to break off with the bf sooner or later and so why must I jump in between them at this critical period? I foresee a very awkward meeting next time between both of us - if we meet at all.

So Reddit, no matter what which one of your heads are at work, dating an attached girl is never a good idea. Always remember that even though you had never meet that guy, that guy actually exists and if you get caught, the feeling is never good.

Afterwards, we went back to his place where we played beer pong and got a little more drunk. His GF went to bed and shortly after me and my GF went to bed in a separate room.

Me and her started to have sex when suddenly he knocks and comes in during the middle of it and asks if he can jump in. I told him no because I wasn't interested. Me and my GF had talked about it before and she wasn't interested either. I had talked with Drew before about this and told him I would not be okay with him having sex with my girlfriend of 5 years.

(My GF was pretty intoxicated and not really able to respond. I didn't want to take advantage of her either and told him having a threesome would be taking advantage of her. Luckily I was able to stop him.)

He comes back like 10 minutes later NUDE and holding his hard cock. He walks in telling me ""everything is okay. We're all fucked up so just let it happen."" He starts trying to put his cock in her mouth and I cover her face so he doesn't do this bullshit.

I was furious at this point. Quickly, I lead her to the bathroom and ""wake"" her up. I grab all my shit and storm out.

He never apologized until I brought up how disrespectful this was to me and my GF. We are both very upset and she is very glad I did not let this happen.

He said he was sorry and blamed it on his intoxication.

Honestly Reddit, it's been almost all I can think about since Friday night. I felt so betrayed. How could he do this to me? It's as if he has no respect for me. After all these years!

At times he would be a real jerk to me and I have put up with his ""mean"" acts many times. It's those moments that had me thinking ""why am i even friends with him?"" that have led to this feeling I'm having. I feel fed up. Like I'm done.

**TL; DR**
Went on a double date with best friend and after a concert we went back to his place. We were all intoxicated and after his GF went to sleep, me and my GF were having sex when he decided to ""forcefully"" include himself after I had clearly said no. Me and my GF grabbed our stuff and left.

(She's really glad I stopped him from  taking advantage of her. Also, he didn't say anything until I finally texted how upset we both are. He tried acting like nothing was wrong.)

EDIT: Me and my GF miss our friendship with this other couple, but we are both still not over it and upset. I'm not sure if I can or even should get over this.

(They like to party and drink a lot and I'm getting tired of it to be honest. My GF is with me of course. We like to stay healthy and keep it mellow most of the time .)

I took a break and drove over to say hi, she's wasn't there. She didn't respond to her phone when I called or texted. This morning, she called me, and after a bit of prying, she eventually told me that she made out with this guy.

So RA, let me know if I need to explain more.

I love her, but I am willing to walk away if I need to. Is it worth working through this or should I just leave her? 

Being caught up in all of this, I need your help. If I end my best relationship ever over this, am I overreacting? 


Thanks.


**UPDATE:** 
Just spoke with her. She told me more. That there was one other thing that happened with him a few days ago. Monday night, clothes came off, *they didnt have sex, she didnt touch him down below, but that he fingered her and ate her out...*
She swears that that is everything that happened. 

**Also,** when she was in tears, not able to look at me, I told her I loved her but that I respect myself more.

I broke up with her and walked out of her apartment.


**UPDATE 2**

After being single  for about 3ish hours, she called to tell me that she dropped the guys daughter as a guitar student and that he is out of her life. She wanted to talk with me tonight, I reminded her that I have plans (tonight = last final = classmates at my place for drinks tonight) and that we can talk another time.  I also pressed her for more info about what went on with the guy, she says that there is absolutely nothing more that happened.

**PS!** thank you all for your support. really helped me to be more ok with my decision to end things with her.  I will go study, 2 hrs til test time, and cry now. (probably wont cry... yet?) thank you all.

Your guys' comments and advice came through really clear and helped a lot. Especially the simple 
&gt; She likes you and won't say no.

From saranowitz.  That got me really motivated. 

So the story.. We hung out a couple more times just at the coffee shop to study.  She started to seem a lot more into me in a more than a friend way the second time we went.  Then Thursday, we had plans to meet some friends at a bar, but she decided to stay home and watch movies and invited me.  I would have to be blind to miss a sign like that.  Plans changed a bit and she came to my place instead.  I put my arm around her as we sat down and she instantly reciprocated and sat in close.  When she was leaving I went in for a kiss, needless to say she didn't shut me down.

Super happy right now.  Thanks for your advice and well wishes Reddit!",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_m8kyz,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/m8kyz/followup_to_asking_out_a_good_friend/,

My girlfriend calls me up today and out of nowhere says 

""How would you feel if I put one of those forwarding message apps on your phone?""

My response was probably the exact same as most of you ""What the fuck? Why?""

We got to talking and I told her I really don't care if she does it. I have nothing to hide - and I'm serious, I have nothing to hide Reddit. I told her she's going to get bored watching me play Kingdom Age or however the app works.

My only problem is, when I jokingly said to her ""Ok but I get to put it on your phone"" she got really defensive. She told me that she *has guy friends she talks to on a regular basis and she thinks I'd have a problem with that* - which I don't. This made me start to think that she's only wanting to put it on my phone because she is hiding something and feels guilt.

**EDIT UPDATE**

Finally home.

We talked it out. I sat down with her and asked her where she got the idea for that app. She said ""oh me and my sister were talking today and she joking said it to her husband and he flipped out. I just wanted to see how you'd respond."" I probably should have stated that our original conversation was via phone. As far as the other guys, yes she does text them, but I know they're just friends. I told her everything, how I felt, what I thought about her maybe placing her possible actions on me. We've been dating for 2 years, I know when she's being sincere and she told me that there is no way in hell she would cheat on me. She's been cheated on in the past and it left its mark on her.

I asked her what she thought about switching phones for a day. She told me she wouldn't have a problem with it, so I took hers for about 2 hours to see shed react when messages came in and out. She didn't even flinch - she had my phone as well. We switched back, just knowing she would go through with it was good enough for me.

As far as her getting defensive with me, we really didn't discuss that too much. She's Puerto Rican, I'm white, and she just has that attitude about her sometimes. You have to remember, she knew that I thought she was serious, so when I asked her to do it, she thought I was being serious. By *really defensive* I mean she responded with ""Oh hell no, I don't need you checking in on everything I do 24/7 and I don't need to explain every little thing I do to you."" Or something along those lines (I'm paraphrasing).

I am a 21f and he is 19m.  We've been together for about a year and a half.

This weekend we went out and had some drinks with friends.  I didn't think he'd had too much, but he was slurring his words and being a little belligerent by the time we decided to call it a night.  We got back to his house and I tried to initiate sexy time by taking off my clothes and rubbing my nipples on him.  He said that he wasn't feeling well, so I stopped.  

This is where things take a turn.  I kept my hand on his cock and was idly playing with it.  Some time afterwards, he started to get hard.  His eyes were closed, but he was thrusting against me.  I took this as a green light and mounted him.  We had sex for a little while and eventually he ejaculated in me without much warning (I am not on birth control, so this was not usual).  But it was really hot at the time and we actually had a simultaneous orgasm.  I figured we would get Plan B in the morning. 

Well, we woke up the next morning and were snuggling in bed a little bit when my boyfriend was like, ""I had the weirdest dream that we were having sex and I came inside of you!  I am so glad that I turned you down for sex last night.""  

He proceed to launch into a giant tirade about how guys are expected to always be in the mood, and he's just glad that he can trust me to respect his boundaries even when I'm really horny.  He talked about how much he loved me for taking care of his drunk self.  At this point, I should have just been honest--but I wasn't.  I pretended like everything was fine.

Sine then, the guilt has been eating me alive and I just don't know what to do.  There's no chance that he'll find out if I don't tell him.  I bought Plan B and took it behind his back.

About eight months ago, he found some medicine prescribed to her and after some research found they were used to treat HIV.  She told him that her sister, who is a nurse, prescribes them to her because she has health insurance and then she sends them to her sister in another state.  I knew that if this was true, I did not want to know about it and knew it was extremely illegal.  It sounded highly suspicious though, and I vowed to not tell anyone about it, so I kept quiet.

About a month or two ago, he sees the pills sticking out of her purse again.  He grabs them, and sees they are nearly gone.  He confronts her again, and after much denial, she finally confesses that she was born with HIV.  She moved into his place about six months ago.

I cannot tell anyone, hence the throwaway.  I just feel like this is an issue that shouldn't be swept under the rug.  This is my best friend, and he has his whole life ahead of him.  I don't want to see him get such a horrible disease, but he loves this girl.  I have felt like she has betrayed his trust on multiple occasions though, and I feel it is completely unacceptable for someone to hide something such as this.  She never even told him despite them only ever having unprotected sex!  I will have to ask him if he is protecting himself now that I think of it.

I need advice.  I don't know how to talk to him about this without making him angry at me, but I also recognize how much trust he put in me by telling only me and feel that it is my responsibility to say something.  He is smart enough to understand the risks, but I feel his judgment could be clouded by his emotions.  If it is what he truly wants though, I will accept that for him.  It's just that he has so much ahead of him.  I don't want to see his life ruined by this girl who I have long suspected only wants his money anyway.

We basically talked about everything and he realized that this was merely the ""last straw"" and we had bigger issues to sort out, so we talked for a very long time (like we always do), and he realized that not fighting for me really ended up doing more damage, and he promised to never do that again. We're starting over with baby steps... Thanks to everyone who commented with meaningful insight and realized that there was obviously more things afoot to consider!  :) 


It was probably the worst timing ever, and I need some advice... We've been dating for 2 years so we're very close...

He basically didn't really want to go to the Journey concert because it was outdoors and we had lawn seats (its really hot in Texas)... While we were looking for places to sit out in the lawn, he texted me by accident, instead of his best friend, ""Goddamn Journey concert with *****. So annoying"" 

I didn't get the text until we'd gotten in our seats (we upgraded for a small fee), and he seemed really happy... But that's when I looked at my phone and saw it. (I'm more frustrated because he made me take HIM instead of my mom who really wanted to go...)

I'm really upset because he was talking negatively behind my back and also didn't want to be there even though he previously acted super excited... I told him I wanted a break because we'd been having problems... Reddit, what would you do? 

tl;dr - Boyfriend texted me instead of his best friend, how annoying it was being at the Journey concert with me, while at the concert.

&amp;nbsp;^&amp;nbsp;

I've had to close three *good* polls today. It broke my heart because this is the type of content we hate to discourage. However, /r/relationship_advice is *not for polling!* In order to keep this subreddit representative of what it truly is, the rules require that the posts be **either requests for relationship advice or updates to previous posts only.** Otherwise, we'll be spammed with all sorts of random only-distantly-relationship-related junk that we won't be able to control.

Please post polls either to /r/AskReddit or to other subreddits which may allow it.

&amp;nbsp;^&amp;nbsp;

Additionally, We've noticed that a lot of people are sending relationship advice posts via modmail. There's a debate amongst mods right now as to why it is that we're getting so many requests via modmail, but I have a theory: people don't realize that ""Ask Relationship Advice"" is a self-post submit link.

Well, **here's an image which summarizes [what to press and what not to press](http://i.imgur.com/8c5fw.png) to submit a request for relationship advice.** It is highly recommended that you **use a throwaway** for relationship advice requests. Message a moderator when reporting issues, such as inquiring about posts that may have been spam-binned, complaining about trolls, or reporting harassment. As always, **please read the rules before posting,** as they've probably been updated since the last time you read them.

I can't come to terms with this shit,ShesNotSorry,156,38,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hhqwh/exgf_cheated_on_me_for_7_years_and_i_just_found/,"**Summary: My GF was an ultra loyal angel for 7 years.  She dumped me recently and now in the aftermath, I found out she is actually a monster in disguise and I can't reconcile how its the same person I spent 7 years with.  I found out she cheated on me the entire time, confronted her with red-handed evidence, and she refuses to apologize and wants to sweep it under the rug! WTF???**

Both of us are late 20s.  Dated for 7 years but didn't live together.  I'm an independent minded guy, she's a very passive girl with low self confidence, very much a people pleaser.

**The Good Times:**
From day one this girl was always dedicated to me.  She was my biggest fan, she always wanted to watch me at events I participated in, and would be upset if she ever missed one.  For 7 years she did everything for me.  Anything I needed, I could always count on her to come through.  She was so giving it was crazy.  She gave a lot more than I gave to her.  Once in a while she would even surprise me with relatively expensive gifts out of nowhere.  She lived to please me.  She almost never complained.  When my car broke down, she gladly drove me everywhere.  When I lost my job she believed in me and supported me.  She'd always call me often, and she'd be the one pleading to hang out if we didnt have anything planned.

I've been cheated on by past GFs and I know the signs.  With this girl I NEVER, ever suspected anything.  I never had a single urge to snoop, it wasnt worth the risk of losing her trust if I got caught.  I felt she would never do anything like that, the idea was preposterous.  She was a terrible liar and I'd be able to tell right away if she ever was guilty (or so I thought).

Also, she always wanted to please me.  If I was ever upset at her, she'd be so distraught she'd cry and want to reconcile before going to sleep.  Very weak willed.


**The Bad Times:**
Things were going fine until the last 6 months of last year, she got relocated further away and the LDR made it hard for us, we only saw each other a few days a week instead of every day.  She put in a huge effort to make it work and keep it together.  But suddenly in January she started ignoring my calls and coming up with lame excuses why she was busy.  Quickly I suspected she met someone else.  Then she says ""we have to talk"" and she tells me she needs time alone.  Immediately I ask if she met someone else and she says no.  I grill her and basically had to beat it out of her and finally she admits she did meet someone else.  She promises me they ONLY flirted, no kissing, no time alone, no sex.  She says I should always be able to trust her and that she ""NEVER cheated on me"".  She convinced me she was a good person, being respectable enough to break up with me BEFORE she cheated (sex) with this guy.  She apologized a lot and acted really sorry she was dumping me this way.

She complimented me saying I was really good in bed, and talked at length about her favorite things she liked about me sexually, for several weeks after the breakup.

Even though she was dumping me, she was very concerned that I didn't think badly of her.  She kept saying how she doesnt hate me, and she really doesnt want me to hate her, she hopes we can stay friends but she is dumping me for this guy.  7 Years down the drain overnight, with no warning.  That was fucking brutal and I'm still devastated by it.  She reiterated how she ""NEVER cheated on me"".  There was a lot of talking during the breakup and a lot of deep confessions and things came out between us, but nothing seriously bad.  She did admit to lying the final weeks about where she was, to hide the fact she was hanging out with this new guy, but that's about it.

Then I find out she had the new guy MOVE IN with her the NEXT WEEK after she dumped me!!  WTF???  And slowly I woke up from my state of shock, to realize she must have been cheating on me with him for a period of time well before she finally broke up with me.  She fucking lied!  She wanted to have her ""cake and eat it too"" and she must have been ""testing him out"" for a while to make sure it was guaranteed, before she finally dumped me. Unbelievable.

**The Ugly Times:**
A few weeks ago from today (3 Months after the breakup), I accidentally stumble upon old chat logs from the last 2 years on my cell phone.  (**Which used to be her cell phone** that she generously gave me...)

**In these logs were the most shocking and disgusting thing I have ever had to find out: She had been cheating on me repeatedly over the entire relationship with her old ex boyfriend!!**  He asked her at one point if I ever suspected anything with ""all the fooling around we used to do"".  I nearly vomited!!  So I guess she cheated on me a ton somewhere during the beginning of our relationship.  Then in the logs from 1 and 2 years ago, I found HER actually INITIATING the cheating by contacting him!!!  She told him how I was out of town and was inviting him over explicitly for discreet sex!!  I can't fucking believe it!!  Stabbed right in the fucking back by the person I trusted more than anyone in my entire life!!  And he just got married 2 years ago so he was a newlywed at the time!

We were hanging out often during this time period, and active and having a lot of fun!  Plenty of good sex.  So she must have been lying to me about why she was busy certain nights, cheating on me, and then hanging out with me the days before &amp; after, WITH NO SIGNS OF GUILT OR REMORSE!!  I never had a fucking clue!  It evidently didnt bother her at all!  WTF???  How can this be the same girl???  She was also making plans for us to move in together at this same time!!!

So after I find this out, I call her up and confront her.  I dont reveal exactly what I know, but I ask her to come clean with me.  I ask if she has anything she wants to admit about lying and cheating on me.  She says ""not that I know of"".  I told her the gig was up and I knew she cheated and I want her to come clean and tell me everything.  She refuses.  She keeps trying to dodge it and escape.  She asks how in the world did I find this out?  She keeps asking me to admit what I know.  I said no, because then I know you'll only admit to what you think I know.  I want you to come clean so I can at least have the comfort of finally knowing the truth about everything.  She absolutely refuses.  She actually had the nerve to say ""I dont know why we have to dwell on this.""!!!!  Are you fucking kidding me?  I find out she cheated on me the entire time and lied to my face, and she's irritated that I wont get over it instantly?  She was VERY OBVIOUSLY not prepared to take responsibility for what she did.

The ONLY thing she said was she was ""sorry you had to find that out.""  She's only sorry she got caught!

She said it was 2 guys, one at the beginning and one at the end.  She claims she was loyal to me for 6 out of the 7 years.  She refused to tell me either of their names.  Then she kept trying to get me off the phone.  It was pathetic.  She said she really has to go.  This is totally unlike her.  I cant BELIEVE she would dodge responsibility after being caught red handed.  The only thing she said in her defense was ""I never felt like you loved me or cared about me."" and also ""But I was WITH *you* the whole time, and I did everything for you"" (which is true).  I said that she thought she would get away with it, she never thought I would find this out, to which she replied ""Obviously"".  WTF!?

The chat logs prove she was cheating on me for at LEAST the first year and the last 2 years, so she obviously lied straight to me AGAIN even when I was confronting her red handed.  (When she claimed she was loyal 6 of 7 years).  

Since then she has refused to respond to me to this day.  I sent her an angry email the next day, explaining how brutal this is for me and how she destroyed me, and that all I want is for her to come clean so I can stop being tortured by my mind running rampant analyzing everything that ever happened in the last 7 years and wondering if it was all a lie and she was cheating on me those times too.  I told her I wanted her to be so sorry and apologize.  But she has shown no remorse!!!  She doesnt even seem sorry for what she did!!  She doesn't care that she's totally destroyed me!

She has not responded at all.  This is so unlike her.  She talked to me a TON the first 2 months of the breakup.  She apologized repeatedly during that time, saying sorry she left me for someone else and sorry her feelings for me had changed and sorry we couldn't work things out.  But now that I've found out who she really is, she's clammed up tight.  I have not contacted her either during the past 3 weeks, and it's been brutal as I slowly come to the realization that an apology may not arrive in my inbox anytime soon.

I seriously can't come to terms with this.  How could she be SO giving, SO supportive, SO Loyal to me for 7 years, and SUCH a wuss in general, but secretly be cheating on me the whole time?   How could it not bother her?  If I was upset at her for a trivial thing she'd be in tears normally, but she could cheat on me and see me the next day and show no signs of guilt??  And when I confronted her red handed on the phone, she didnt sound sad at all.  She sounded short and edgy and wanting to escape and to minimize the situation.

I have never been so deeply betrayed by anyone in my life.  Not even an enemy.  I am completely devastated.  I cant go 1 hour without being tormented by the pain of this.  I can hardly sleep at night.  The worst part is not knowing the truth.  As pathetic as it sounds, I would love to hear she only cheated on me with 2 guys and only the first and last 2 years.  At least I could believe there were SOME good times that were faithful.  She wont even give me that.  Instead I feel like the biggest sucker in history for putting my 100% trust in her and her completely abusing it in the most painful possible way.  I have to wonder if every ""girlfriend she visited"" was really a lie and she was cheating on me those weekends.  I have to wonder if she cheated on me every time I went out of town, not just the 2 or 3 times I found in chat logs.  I have to wonder if EVERY. FUCKING. THING. she ever said to me was a lie.

I have met pathological liars before and I hate them.  But let me tell you, my ex-gf never acted like that.  I cant even THINK of a lie she ever told me!  Thats what really blows my mind.  Here I was convinced she was too sweet and innocent to be capable of even a small lie, while the whole time she was a master at disguising the BIGGEST lies.  WTF?!?

Help me Reddit.  I dont have any close friends.  I am so fucking ashamed that I was tricked into giving 7 years of my life to this bitch, I cant tell anyone close to me that she cheated on me.  I feel like killing myself.  I cant escape this.  I feel violated, and robbed of 7 years of my life.  I cant get them back.  I cant go back.  

I'm mentally mind fucked by this constantly, how could she be so good to me and then so evil in secret?  And to just shit on me and leave me for dead now that it's over?  I don't even deserve an apology and to come clean?  What is going on in her head?

What can I do to get her to address this to me?  It kills me that she got away with it.  She seems happy as can be with her new guy, already living together, and acting like this doesnt bother her.  While I'm left totally destroyed.

1. Nobody is obligated to have feelings for you.  Not even if you like them a whole lot, and all your mutual friends say you'd be good together, and the person they do have feelings for is totally wrong for them.

2. It's never wrong to like someone (but see point #1).

3. Keeping your feelings a secret to avoid rejection and not giving someone a chance to say ""yes"" doesn't do anyone any favors.

4. A relationship won't fix your life.  Neither will getting laid.

5. It helps a lot to figure out what you actually want when it comes to relationships, and not just what you think you should want.  

6. A lot of the stuff that initially attracts us to people isn't very relevant for good sex.  It's not all that relevant for good relationships, either.

7. Just because you decide that the traditional standards aren't important doesn't mean that other people will.

8. There's nothing wrong with sex that's not part of a committed relationship.  There's nothing wrong with not wanting that, either.

9. ""The number"" can mean so many things that it's meaningless.

10. Picking someone up at a bar or a party isn't a very useful model for sexualized interactions that don't take place at a bar or a party.

11. Flirting can be fun, but anyone who plays mind games isn't worth your time.

12. If you can't decide if someone's playing ""hard to get"" or not, just take them at their word.  If they can't be open about what they want, then hey, it's their loss.

13. No one gender is a gatekeeper to relationships or sex, or ""has all the power.""  

14. If ""the mood"" is so fragile that one miscue can break it, then it probably wasn't there to begin with.

15. Bad sex is not always preferable to no sex.

16. Men are not all commitment-phobic horndogs who will hump anything with a pulse.  Women are not all fickle, unfathomable creatures that have to be manipulated into anything sexual.  

17. There's really no such thing as ""the one.""

18. If there's something you can't talk to your partner about, it's probably going to be a problem at some point.

19. Sometimes relationships don't work out.  It doesn't always mean that one partner was right and the other was wrong, or that the relationship ""failed.""

My question is WHY? ,whywouldshe,199,82,246,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/u1538/girlfriend_of_7_years_cheated_on_me_with_some/,"**I posted this on AskReddit first. It appears as though that community is full of trolls. This is a long read and I am verbose but just hear me out...**

This is a throwaway simply because a lot of my friends and work associates use reddit and have me added as a friend. The truth is I'm embarrassed. In my line of work weakness isn't tolerable and I'd be a laughing stock.

I'm 32 years old. I met my girlfriend (we're calling her Joanne, 29 years old) on the 31st of December 2004 at a New Years Eve party. For me it was almost love at first sight. We only talked for an hour but I couldn't get her out of my head for weeks. I was dating someone else at the time and the second week in January I was still thinking about this relatively trivial conversation I'd had with Joanne. I told my current girlfriend of the time that things couldn't work out. I didn't know if I would see Joanne ever again but I'd felt something in that one conversation I'd never felt before. It was an amicable split, I was honest and told her I liked her but didn't love her.
I tried to track Joanne down through friends and the like - these were the days before facebook and I never used myspace. I finally got a hold of her number and when I rang she said she remembered me too. I asked her out on a date and we spent a lot of time together. Another guy in our social group fancied Joanne so we took it slow. We were very cryptic about how we felt and didn't even kiss until about a month of seeing each other. After that our relationship went off on a rocket and I'd never even dreamed of feeling that way before. We were inseparable (and intolerable no doubt). We went everywhere together and she loved the things I did and I loved the things she did. I'd never met a girl that got into things like snowboarding and surfing so quickly - and she loved it. I even took dance lessons and mastered the samba with her!

It's not been all sunshine and lollipops though and I'll be the first to admit - we've had our problems like any other couple. We broken up once about three years ago but wasn't apart for more than 3 months. We've lived both together and apart. Whatever happened I thought I'd been the most reasonable, loving, caring boyfriend I could be. She got pregnant when we was about 1 year in and I stuck completely by her. She said she wanted it, that she couldn't abort it and I said I'd be with her no matter what. When she miscarried I took weeks off work to be by her side. I told her that I was there for no matter what - always. When she was kicked out of home because her parents moved to Australia I financially supported her until she got on her feet. These were tough times. It was hard for both of us but I felt we grew because of them. I felt that going through all this was something special. So I proposed on New Years Eve last year after taking her to the place we first met. (A bar with a rooftop balcony thing). I told her that we should see if it was open on the off chance before we went home at around 2am. She agreed but when we got there she noticed it wasn't a bar anymore. I already knew this beforehand and through my contacts I got in touch with the music shop owner and he let me use his roof. I took her up the fire escape and I had the whole roof almost exactly how it looked that that night, which included renting a huge fish tank and a bunch of Christmas lights, the whole thing set me back £600 - bitch. There was a table in the middle with two glasses and a bottle of champagne. I got down on one knee and she cried and said yes.

The last 6 months I've been working really hard. I'm in sales and we've had a potentially life-changing deal coming through that would make the company I'm with millions in the next 5-8 years. I haven't stopped working my arse off and I've told her it's going to be tough but that I'm doing it for us. if I get it, I told her, we could have an absolute dream wedding. Well the last couple of months have been nail-biting but I finally secured the deal and netted myself a huge bonus and job security for life. I was on cloud 9 so I bought Joanne and I some tickets to go away and celebrate. Yesterday my boss let me go home early because of my work and I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to suprise her. I nipped in the flower shop and got her a bunch of white roses before slipping back home for a shower and to get out of my suit. I was driving in my white merc to her house on the top of the world, work was brilliant, the weather was beautiful, I had the perfect surprise and I couldn't wait to tell her.

Anyway when I arrived there was a shitty SUV parked outside that I had seen before but couldn't place. The penny didn't even drop when the door was unnaturally locked. I unlocked it and called her name, there was some music playing and I didn't hear her reply. I figured she was in the shower, and fixed myself a glass of water and some water for the flowers. In the kitchen there was some cheap wine and two glasses. Then I heard the bed banging. My heart sank and I pieced it all together. I used to think 'my heart sank' was a metaphor but I actually felt something drop inside my chest. It was like going on one of those bungee rides in theme parks. I almost dropped the glass. I walked to the stairs and at the bottom there were these pair of ruined old leather boots covered in dirt. I was red with rage. I walked up the stairs and could hear him calling her a slut. I swung her bedroom door open. There she was getting fucked in the arse. I shit you not. He was fucking her in the arse. She leaped up instantly and before I knew it he had his pants on. I looked at him and recognised him. It was this guy that owns a vegan cafe near my place. We'd been a few times and he had a couple of party's she had been to with friends. He tried to explain himself but I just told him to get the fuck out right now. He left so quick he forget to take his cheap wine with him the bastard. I couldn't believe it. She ran over to touch me, hug me - or something but I just threw her back down on the bed. I told her she disgusted me and I left.

I went straight to my car and she followed my out pathetically asking me to hear her story. I told her not to fucking call me and dropped my personal mobile out the window. I own a work one but it's blocked from anyone other than colleagues. I went home and got in the shower and just cried. I can't believe it. The more I think about the relationship the more I cry I thought about the miscarriage and cried and then my proposal and cried and the the first time I met her and I cried even more. I've not been in to work today. I called and told my boss everything. He's a great friend and on of three people who know. He's told me to have a holiday from work and that I've done more than enough in the last year. He told me to take a week and then see how I feel. She's been knocking on my door and calling my landline so I plugged it out. My friend stopped by earlier after he heard what happened from my boss. A lot of my friends are worried. They havent heard from me and can't get in contact because I dropped the phone.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TL:DR: Love of my life cheated on me for some broke, piece of shit vegan. I want to know why.**

Anyway reddit. I know the standard advice. I'm not looking for that. Can someone just please tell me WHY?!!!?? I loved her. I do love her. So fucking much. I just wanted us to be happy and I had worked so hard for that. All that hard work - it wasn't for me. It was for us. How could she fucking do this after she fucking miscarried my baby and I paid for stupid fucking art studies when her parents fucked off without a trace. I'm just confused. How could she fucking betray me after everything we've been through. I don't understand it. What would make a girl that loves you, that said yes to marriage with you, that was gonna have your baby, that was with you for 7 years, that called you pet names, that you would cuddle and make love to. What would she do it? With this broke jackass. This piece of shit that couldn't support a fucking puppy.

**EDIT:** Some of you have given me advice to say take an STD test. I've already booked one with my private physician for tomorrow. As far as what other action I've taken - I've just bought a new mobile online and I have cancelled all debit payments on my card for her gym membership, business classes and what not. I don't think I'm going to ask her ""why?"" I'm just angry now. I think the answer is obvious - she didn't care enough about me to have a bit of restraint.

I'm a 23 year old male who recently moved to a new city after landing a good job in it.  I'm on my own out here, and have been for over a month.

Let me say that I haven't been involved in a relationship in a long time. Like, somehow I went through all of college without having a girlfriend. I went to a really small campus and never really clicked with any of the girls who went there. I had a handful of dates during school, but nothing ever managed to progress to being a full on relationship.  It was definitely something that bothered me back then, and in hindsight I wish I had been a bit more forthcoming with meeting girls and making the first move. Oh well, I'm not in school anymore!

Well, now I'm out on my own in a different part of the world and I don't really know anyone out here outside of the folks I work with.  I'd *really*, more than anything else right now, like to find a nice girl here who shares my interests and I can talk to, but I don't know where to start.  I've tried checking out a few bars in the area, but all the woman there look significantly older than me, and / or were being chatted up by some other guy. 

I know the stereotypical response here is something like ""join a kickball league to meet people"" but I don't really care about kickball, I care about video games and reddit and drums and bass music.

I guess what I'm asking is, how can I meet a girl when I'm naturally inclined to stay indoors and don't have a lot of friends where I am?",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_cfjgf,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cfjgf/how_do_i_find_a_nice_girl_in_a_new_city_where_i/,

She swore on everything she loved that nothing was going on we were just going through a rough patch. Last night I was laying awake in bed thinking about her suspicious behavior.

I confronted her about it and she freaked. Told me that it was a joke and they were talking about some other chick and making fun of her. I believed her for a second until I read it again. There's no mention of another person anywhere else in this conversation. I am so torn up and confused right now. I told her to go and leave her key but she refused to leave it and went to her girlfriends. How long do I give her to get her stuff out? Is there any chance the above conversation was a joke?

The police took me under voluntary custody and transported me to a cell, where I had to speak to several Residents and Attendings, asking me all the regular questions about hearing voices and what not, to be sure there wasn't anything fundamentally wrong with my mental functions.

The perfect baby, even through the crying and late night feedings. When he was two years old, he fell into the deep end of our pool and drowned. 

This destroyed my wife. When our son was born, she quit her job to stay home with him. She adored him, and he, her. They were inseparable, he was the light of her life. And I adored their relationship, and was very close to him as well. His death devastated us both. But I healed. It still hurts, there's still a hole, but I can live day to day.

As time went on we started dating. I started to notice that he spoke to his mom several times a day on the phone, as well as went home EVERY weekend to see his family, which I thought nothing of at the time. Well, as things started to get more serious, he would want to stay around town to hang out with me and his mom would throw a fit. We are talking...scary fits.

For example, more than once, she put his younger brother (21/M) and sister (17/F) in the car and drove two hours down to his apartment. She would bang on the door and come in crying and throwing a fit. Honestly she acted like a crazy girlfriend. 

As time went on she began to target me. She would call me (sometimes 7 times) just to ask me why I was ""trying to take her baby away"". She began trying to plant things in his head like, ""she just wants you to get her pregnant so you will have to marry her and support her"". WTF. I don't want kids first of all, and second of all, I have a job as a Computer Engineer and make a descent salary. In my opinion it is her that is constantly unhappy because her husband is a truck driver and she relies on him to support her.

Long story short, as time went on she would bring the truck driver dad (who was never home) into it and tell him lies. He could only believe what he heard because he was never home. Btw, she wouldn't let my bf speak to his dad without getting really paranoid, weird? Bc of her, he never was able to have a close relationship with his father. One of the final encounters was her bring the entire family (brother, sister, father, and herself) down and confronting me for turning her son ""against his family"". I began to cry because I had enough, she called me a bitch and my bf told them all to get out and hasn't spoken to them since.

We now live together and I try to speak to him about possibly reuniting with ATLEAST his younger brother and sister. He won't because he says his mom will find out and it is not worth the aftermath. He wont talk to ANYONE from his hometown because his mom has portrayed herself as a saint there and has only heard her side of the story. All they know is that her son, that used to come home and be the biggest family man every, now has stopped speaking to his poor sweet momma.

Please help me! What do I do? We live together now and it pains me to hear him say things like ""all I have now is you"", or ""I wish I had a family"". Don't get me wrong, my family loves him, but it is different when your own family wont talk to you. How do I convince him or support him in this situation? Has anyone else had a similar encounter?

What should I do?,thalonelydonkeykong,139,24,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/o4lmh/i_think_my_brother_is_in_a_relationship_with_a/,"My brother has been involved in an online relationship (if you want to call it that) with a girl from Canada for over 3 years now. They have never met, although she says she has been down here to Montana three times. Creepy right? Well it gets creepier. Everyone (except him) has a boat load of questions as to who she really is, due to the huge pile of BS that she feeds him everyday. TBH, my whole family is getting quite worried because he is not usually so gullible. Last night my mom asked a question on Yahoo questions pertaining to this situation, not realizing that she is in her Yahoo contacts. So now its out in the open, but the reaction from both her and my brother leads us to question her identity even more. Instead of defending herself, she is acting like her feelings are hurt, and now she won't talk to my mom. I don't know exactly what kind of help I'm asking for, but if anyone has any experience/advice/opinions, please help a fellow redditor out. If needed I will list some (if possible all) of the stories that makes us question her existence. If nothing else, her story of getting injured on a 4 wheeler, getting emergency brain surgery, having the doctor accidentally cut her leg with the bone saw, which lead another doctor to punch that doctor in the face (they both still have their jobs), the hero doctor chatted with my brother on AIM right after surgery, and she was on facebook 2 hours later talking about it, makes it blatantly apparent she is a compulsive liar. And this is just one of the many works of fiction not even a soap opera would dare dream up. We are 99.99% sure we've found the imposter on facebook, as she has the same name, lives in the town that she has my brother mail to (which is a totally seperate province than she claims to live in) and apparently she wears a size 9 ring. Yes he bought her an engagement ring. And any girl would know that a size 9 would be way too big for a 5'3'' 98 pound petite darling that she says she is. I know the question is if she's trolling him, (I myself have no doubts), but how do I go about exposing her? Or do I just let him do his thing and not get involved? Any help would be immensely appreciated. This has just gone too far!
UPDATE: A few familiy members and myself are taking him over to their house later today, (if all goes well) to sit his arse down and show him every strand of evidence that he is choosing to overlook. If he chooses to continue this tomfoolery, then I will be posting the name of this girl so you redditors can find the life story of this chick and out her once and for all. Thank you all for your input, you're all very helpful. Except that one guy. You know who you are. UPDATE: Well everybody, we were fucking right! And he took it like a goddamn champ. Surprisingly, he is less devastated than we all thought he would be.  Her name is Chelsea Ryan, and she does live in Digby, Novia Scotia. Oh did I just post her real name? Oopsies! For over 3 years she was stealing facebook pictures from a canadian model, and from other unsuspecting facebookers to make up to 60 profiles for friends that don't exist. It was quite the scheme that she got my whole family (me, not so much) to fall for. My brother (jdubya4211) will be able to answer some questions for anyone who is curious. He's doing an IAmA here on reddit, and don't be dicks guys.http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/o6x62/iama_guy_who_found_out_his_internet_fiance_of/ This story is so twisted it's hard to keep up. In a nutshell, my cousin sat him down (the one who did the most extensive research) showed him the profile of the real girl, the profile of the model, and showed him how all the profiles of her friends had the same IP address.  Not wanting to believe it, he messaged her right away and she confessed instantly, saying she could ""explain"". Supposedly, she was taking everything he said and sent in the mail, and was re-routing it to another girl who thought she was dating my brother. Bullsheeeit! I see a dateline special coming shortly in our future.

She's 1 in a million, and I love and trust (a huge deal for me, as I've really been hurt in the past) her more than I ever thought I could. We share a great deal of intellectual passion, and generally have a very healthy and healing kind of closeness.

There is, however, something that has been really bothering me lately. At first it was no biggie in comparison with all of the other wonderful qualities of the relationship, but I suppose we've reached that reckoning point that happens about a year in where you really start to analyze the possibility of the thing being truly long term.

The sex is awful.

No, really, awful. The worst I've ever had, and I've had a lot. We're both aware of it, we've both talked about it, but it has never improved. The last time we spoke of it, she said that, in the grand scheme of things, she had come to realize that ""some things are less important than others"", essentially stating that our relationship is so much more than sex, and that good sex was worth sacrificing. Let me tell you - I WANT to agree. We're both in our 30s and have a great deal of perspective on relationships at this point ... but I guess my lizard brain is still fully functional, and unhappy with this conclusion. Lizard brain has been present for a whole hell of a lot of good sex, and is definitely missing it.

So, what's going on with the sex?

A bit of background - My sexuality was forged in the fires of fucked-upness. Aggressive, hard sex. Extremes of submission and domination... I could go on, but you probably see where I'm going with this. It's just how it happened. Beyond that, I am a long time musician with a great deal of rhythm. As you might well know, watching someone dance will give you a great deal of insight into what's going to happen in the bedroom. I really feel that, and I've always clicked sexually with jungle women that move sensually and polyrhythmically...

Now, my partner?

On the dancefloor, she gyrates robotically back and forth in place, completely out of sync with the beat. Ask her to sing something for you, and you'll quickly find that she's completely and utterly tone deaf.

In the bedroom? Watch how this matches up ...

Gentle as a fawn. Light as a feather. Stiff as a board. Plops down in missionary and lies motionless as she gets fucked. Rarely initiates moving out of that position. Doesn't thrust into me. Doesn't really make eye contact. Will *shush* me if i fuck her hard enough that the back of the bed hits the wall, because the neighbors might hear, and that'd just be too embarrassing. Completely reliant on a vibrator to achieve orgasm (which is OKAY, but further complicates things) Doesn't suggest anything to me as far as making it better for her, and doesn't listen when I tell her things that would make it better for me.

She claims that she's had great sex before, but, honestly, I am really skeptical. She has even straightup admitted to me that the problem ""might be her"", but also I know that my own sexuality as described above might be a ""problem"" in the context of this loving, respectful relationship. In previous fulfilling sexual encounters, I got off on things like being punched, strangling, dangerous things ... and I can't even imagine bringing that into this beautiful, loving relationship... should I?

Reddit... What do you think? I can't stress enough. I LOVE THIS WOMAN DEARLY, and I'm basically at war internally over this issue. On one hand, she's the most wonderful woman ever - one that I am SO lucky to have ... and on the other, I have unquenched raging sexual desire that is refusing to ignore this problem. 

She is SO, SO passionate about art, cultural transformation, and helping people. I see that, I feel that and a part of me believes that PASSION is PASSION. Can it translate to sexual? How do I spark the fire in this woman's sex drive? Please help!

Last night we talked about everything as we usually do and I just brought it up..feeling that there's no way she would be upset if I did it right. Thank you all for the advices!!!

Here's how it went down:
I asked her, knowing the answer very well, if she was still okay with our sex life because I thought it was great. She said hell yeah :) Well, then she asked me if I wanted to change something and I told her that basically I would like her to jump me every now and then if she has a chance before I'm all over her. She was awesome about it! She said something like this: ""Well, I love that you make a move on me so often and I enjoy the sex very much, but I know you are the active side almost always. So I just try to harass you before you have a chance to do me.""

And then I made a move on her.... 
About the positions I was getting bored of, we jokingly tried the most wtf twists and bends with her and we laughed our asses off :) Then we found something new for a minute and it was great. At the end I figured the 2-3 positions actually work the best so we ended up having sex the regular way!! And I was perfectly fine with it, I just wanted her to know sometimes I'd like her to be the active side of things and it went as well as it could have.

Anyways, we had sex and talked the whole night, didn't sleep at all!!
And how I know nothing was left for discussion? 
She had, no kidding, dozens of orgasms during the night and we were both spent by the time we had to ""wake up"" and go to work.

She's no longer just overweight, she is actually obese.

I did notice it happening, I was okay with that, and we talked about it. She agreed, said she would try to lose the weight, but then she'd go back to university and I wouldn't see her too often, then she'd put even more weight on. Now she's over 250lbs (used to be 135lbs when we first got together) and I'm no longer attracted to her physically. I haven't told her this. She's extremely sensitive about the issue, and tells me I should just love her for who she is. And I do love her, but at this point I'm embarrassed to even go out with her. I know that's horrible, but I just can't help it. When I ask her to lose weight she now gets upset, she says I should be happy however she is. 

When we've spent time together during school breaks, I can see exactly how this happened. Fast food, huge orders, healthy salads which are then covered in fatty dressings. It breaks my heart. I point this out to her, and ask her not to eat so much, but then she gets upset and/or pissed at me. I've tried to get us to go to the gym together, but she says she hates exercise (without realizing that the reason she hates it is because she's overweight). I've tried to get her to do easier stuff, like go for walks, but she doesn't like doing that anymore either.

I don't need advice per se...I just feel so completely alone.  I am finishing my last semester of nursing school, I don't relate well with my classmates, so I'm pretty much socially isolated.

I have my children to stay strong for, and I HAVE to finish school if I'm going to earn enough to provide for their needs.

1349801482.0,113,self.relationship_advice,117bn4,[UPDATE] My boyfriend just drove drunk... again. I need advice on how to approach this with him.,Mille-fleurs,144,31,199,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/117bn4/update_my_boyfriend_just_drove_drunk_again_i_need/,"[[Original post here.]](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/116lbp/my_boyfriend_just_drove_drunk_again_i_need_advice/)

I waited until he'd woken up this morning to speak with him about all this. He immediately started off with another apology, but I told him I was't quite ready for that. I kept the anger out of my voice and just let the concern show through.

I started by saying, ""I need to know what you were thinking last night -- not in some abstract 'How could you?' kind of way, but what the actual thoughts were that were sliding across your brain the instant you got behind the wheel."" I paused, then added, ""Especially knowing that I was just sitting at home, available to pick you guys up at a moment's notice.""

After a moment of silence, he said quietly, ""I really felt fine.""

""But you were absolutely smashed when you got home,"" I argued. ""Am I wrong? Were you just pretending or something?""

He shook his head. ""No, you're right -- I was drunk.""

""Then how could you not have realized that when you got to your car?"" I asked.

He said, ""I went slow. I only drank three beers -- one per hour. I stopped drinking before Jim. I really thought I was fine. I guess when I'm at home, I stop worrying about things and just hang loose, so that's why it didn't come out until I got back.""

I was quiet for a moment as I considered what he'd said. ""I don't really know what to say to that,"" I finally told him. ""I mean, you're 29 and you're saying you don't know your body well enough to know when you're drunk, regardless of how much you drank?""

He shrugged sheepishly. ""I guess not.""

We both fell silent. He looked fairly miserable.

After a minute or two, I said, ""I don't really know what to do about this. I could threaten to call the police next time, but you know the ramifications of drunk driving as well as I do -- probably better than I do.""

He nodded. Then he said, ""And we were so close to the house --""

I cut him off. ""That doesn't make it okay.""

He pressed on: ""...so close to the house that it was even worse that I didn't call you. You could have been there in five minutes.""

""Distance doesn't matter,"" I reminded him. ""Nor does my schedule. You could have been an hour away, and I could have been at work, and I *still* would have come, without complaint.""

""I know.""

""I guess,"" I said slowly, ""the only thing I can think to do is take your car keys from you whenever you plan to go drinking. You shouldn't ever have your car with you if you're incapable of judging how drunk you are.""

To my surprise, he nodded. ""That sounds fair.""

We hashed it out further after that. Here are the main points:

* If he's going to drink, he will not ever take his car. I will drive him and pick him up.
* If I'm unavailable to drive him, he will try to ensure there is a designated driver *with* him at all times.
* If he's with a group of friends and they all end up drinking, and no one -- including myself -- is available to pick them up, he will not ever be the one to offer to drive, even if he's positive he's sobered up.

After all this, I told him that I love him and that I don't want to emasculate him in any way, but that this is too big a mistake to make again. He was very understanding and cooperative, agreeing to all the points I laid out.

I also informed him that if he *did* screw this up again, even after setting these preventative measures in place, that I couldn't promise to stick around. He understood that, too, and apologized again, claiming firmly that he had no desire to hurt me (emotionally) or anyone else (physically).

All in all... everything went better than expected.

I'll talk to Jim (my best friend) today as well. From what my boyfriend's told me, it's entirely possible that Jim, not having seen my boyfriend drunk very often, honestly thought he was sober enough to drive. I just need to let Jim know that if the two of them ever go drinking again, they are to call a sober friend to pick them up, be it me, Jim's girlfriend, or any other friend they choose to contact.

Thank you all for your terrific advice! I really appreciated everything you suggested. To those of you going through something similar, you have my sympathy and my best wishes that you'll find a solution as painlessly as I apparently did.

If you missed my last post, it’s [here](http://www.reddit.com/comments/nqeqa/dont_know_if_this_is_the_right_placeand_morbid_as/). A lot has happened.

So she finally came into the hospital and talked to me today. She sat down on my bed and started crying. She started out saying it was all her fault I tried to kill myself and that she was sorry for everything, which I just kind of stared through awkwardly. And then the real stuff started.

So that “Friend” who got molested? That was her. She got raped by her grandfather when she was really young. Which I guess explains why she was always just as weird about sex as me. I just thought we had a quirk in common; it's one of the reasons we got together, she didn't pressure me for sex. She told me this horrible story that I’m not repeating here, even under a fake name, because it was the most horrifying, fucked up story I’ve ever been told and she deserves privacy. Just suffice to say very very bad things.

She says she got this really bad case of fight-or-flight and kind of did both when I started talking about rape. She wasn’t expecting it and she couldn’t handle it. Which I can sort of understand, but then she made some comments that implied she still didn’t think my rape was as bad as hers. And I couldn’t really let that slide. 

I tried to talk to her, but she just wouldn’t listen to me at all. She just kept telling me it wasn’t the same thing at all, and it spiraled into a fight. She stormed out, slamming the door shut behind her. About twenty minutes later she posted to facebook. I almost didn’t read it. I wish I hadn’t.

Quote: “So [me] thinks he’s been raped. Fan-fucking-tastic. It just pisses me off so much when men think they can comprehend the pain women go through when they’ve been violated like that.”

A few of my friends reacted with surprise. Her friends all started ganging up to bitch me out as the bad guy and told her she was right to break up with me.

My cell phone has been ringing nonstop with my mom. I’m afraid to answer it. I don’t want her to know.

Please, is there any way to make her stop? She’s taking my revelation of rape as a personal attack against her, and I don’t want to admit it but this isn’t the first time I’ve been scared of her. She’s stronger than me and she goes a little nuts sometimes. I usually laugh it off but now I think she’s trying to destroy my life.

Why is America so puritanical? So I had sex with 50 healthy men, sometimes 2 per day, but mostly a few a week. I am an attractive female who attracts good looking men. I like to have sex. Why is this so hard for the hive mind to comprehend a woman who knows what she wants? The reason why I've been in a relationship with my BF for 11 months is because I'm through with that. I got my kicks and got out. I am a lot more happy where I am today but that doesn't mean I didn't have fun doing what I did.

The past month and a half I have reflected a lot, my mind replays our relationship from the first day we met to the end almost like a movie. It makes me sad because I think of the first day we met and how I knew he would mean a lot to me some day and that was a really accurate premonition. I think of last summer when we were so in love, driving in the car to the beach singing together, the day we both were so hungry that we each had a whole pizza to ourselves, I think of the first time he said ""I love you"", I think of the afternoon we were cuddling on the couch and he told me ""I never want us to break up."" 

Then I think of the downfall, the first time he called me an idiot, the first time he pushed me, I think of the horrible arguments and how each of them chipped away at our love. I've thought a lot about how sad it is that people fall out of love. People say ""well then it wasn't love at all"", that's bullshit because I know in my heart I was very in love with him. There are reasons why it happens and you don't really realize it until one day you're looking back at how you used to feel and how you don't feel that way anymore. You hate their long boring stories and you're annoyed by the touch of their hand to your inner thigh. Before, you couldn't get enough of either.

Well after 3 years she finally wanted to have sex and we tried but it was just too painful for her. A year later and still no more progress on that. She was busy with school and never in the mood. Well she has a friend at college that she has known for 3 years and they both are kinda going through the same thing with their relationships and how his gf is very similar to me. I don't know all the details but they ended up going to his car and all she would tell me is that she slid her panties over and he fucked her and she was in pain. She found out she was pregnant about a week later and then a few days after that she decided to tell me. I don't know how someone could let a man take advantage of their emotions like that and give them something that their lover has been waiting years for. I can't get that picture out of my mind of them fucking. Thing is I still love her and I forgive her but I still want to be with her. I know she realized her mistake because everyone is telling her that she is going to lose the best thing in her life and she cries all the time about it. She let her emotions get to her and made a poor decision now she has to have his baby. We both want to be together but I need help : (.

So she was waiting for her tip out from credit cards for the week and she was hanging out drinking at work with a cook she works with. 

Now I am not a jealous person at all I have no problem when she hangs out with guys, my best friend is a woman who a dated for 8 years so I really have no problems at all with it. 

She then went bar hoping with him and said she would be home at 6pm, at 8 I called her and she was just leaving another bar and heading home. at 9 pm she was hanging out talking with him and said she would head home, she was really really trashed at this point and could not really talk well. 

at 9:30 I went looking for them and found them on a corner making out and he was groping her. 

He tried to fight me which I would not let happen he was trashed as well. 

I still love her and trust her but can I really trust other guys if they are just going to get her trashed and try to do things with her. 

She did say that the only reason nothing more happened tonight was because she loved me. So I assume he was trying to get her to have sex as well. 

any advice would be great.

Thank you.

How do I confront her about it without involving him.

My wife (F/42) and I (M/43) have been married 10 years and after my son was born (M/9) they have been very stressful and unsatisfying (for both of us). She and I didn't want to have children but when we got pregnant we both decided to keep him. We have a great son, but my wife has had a serious case of depression and anxiety ever since the delivery (we tried counseling, antidepressants, exercise, new age treatments and she doesn't improve). She blames us (me and my son) for ruining her life and taking away her dreams. She is a stay at home mom who hates it but doesn't get a job.

She has been telling me that she wants a divorce since our son was two years old - but has never gone through with it. My son and I have done our best to get her out of her depression (help with counseling, activities, chores around the house, etc). But she screams at us at the slightest provocation (real or imaginary) and is verbally abusive towards us on a regular basis. 

Last week she and I had a horrible fight, because she is always complaining that I don't do enough around the house (I cook, clean, do more than my fair share), that I must be gay, and that I am not a real man, etc. etc. So we got into a screaming match (my son was in school so he didn't hear/see it).  My son told me today that a couple of days ago my wife told him that she didn't love me, that she hated were we live and living with us, that she hates the people in our city and that she only stays because of him (and that he should be grateful to her for staying and making all those sacrifices for him only) - she told me the same thing during our fight.

I need to confront her as we had agreed not to involve our son in any of our confrontations - what would be a good approach to confront her without involving him? I don't want to end up in another fight but this crap I will not let stand. I don't know if she is trying to shame him into obedience and love or what, but I don't want our son to feel responsible for her happiness (which is what I believe she is trying to do).

My girlfriend of 4 years and I recently broke up because ""I don't listen"" and ""don't treat her right"". Which may have been true some of the time, but she wasn't with me for 4 years for no reason. We are both 24 years old. We have lived together through one 6 month lease and just recently signed another year at a new house. As soon as we broke up she started going out every night and smoking weed and coming home drunk/high which was very out of line with her character. Long story short she met a guy at a bar who fixed her car for free and now they are dating. She's been sleeping at his house and she's moving out this week. She still calls every once in a while to talk about money or the house and the cats and ask me what I'm doing, but she pretty much despises me now it seems like and doesn't want ANYTHING to do with me. I know that she wasn't cheating on me because I have online proof of when they met. I've tried to work it out with her, but she doesn't wanna hear anything I have to say. I don't know what to do. I've been absolutely heart broken. This hurts worse than anything I've ever felt before, and I've lost good friends and immediate family to accidents/cancer. It just hurts to have someone be your world and then all of a sudden you feel like you don't even know them anymore. I guess my questions are what could be going on in her mind? What could cause someone to turn their back on someone that's given 4 years of their life to you? Do you think there is a chance she will give me another shot? Keep in mind I've tried everything only to be brushed off. I don't know what to do. She's moving out and after that I feel like all will be lost. Thanks for reading.

EDIT :After I made this post she came to the house and told me she was scared she got an std from this new guy. I took her to the doctor and got her checked. It's hard to imagine her sleeping with someone else.

A few months ago she broke it off, saying she just wasn't feeling the love anymore. I was devastated. Of course she tried to keep me as a close friend, which I tried to make work for a few weeks, but my feelings were torturing me. I looked to reddit for advice.

It is to the point I want to break up with him over this issue.,menagetrois,174,64,302,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csxg9/boyfriend_wont_reciprocate_with_mmf_threesome_for/,"I am really sexually open.  When I first started dating my boyfriend, he would make all of these little sly comments about how seeing me with another woman would be so hot, etc.  Finally, I directly asked him if he wanted a threesome.  He said yes, and proceeded to tell me about a threesome that he had had with an ex-girlfriend.  He went into detail about who did what to whom, how awesome it was, etc.  

I am not a jealous person, and actually kind of get turned on by hearing stories of my partner's sexual past.  I figured that since he was talking openly about his past, he was the same, so I told him about the two threesomes I have had in the past.  Neither of mine involved me being in a relationship with anyone involved, one was MFF and one was MMF.  When I told him about the MFF threesome he seemed aroused, but as soon as I brought up the MMF threesome, he freaked out.  He said that was disgusting and that he didn't think I was the ""type"" of woman who would do such things. He was actually so upset he stormed out and left.

Once he had calmed down and we talked again, I tired to reassure him about the situation by assuring him my experience wasn't like the one typically depicted in porn, where two men dominate and control the woman in a sometimes degrading manner.  He again got angry, and said that he didn't want to hear any details, and that he was going to try to forget I had ever mentioned the whole thing.

I figured that was that....until he began bringing up having a MFF threesome again.  Honestly, I am really straight, and not that into women.  The one MFF threesome I had was not that great, while the MMF threesome was amazing.  When my boyfriend brought up the MFF threesome again, I joking suggested that he would have to reciprocate by inviting another guy to join us.  He once again got horribly angry, and told me never, ever, ever to bring that up again.

Besides this issue, our relationship is going really well.  We have been together for bout 8 months now, and really love each other.  However, this whole thing has made me feel like he has really outdated and sexist views on female sexuality and is sexually selfish. I feel really bitter at him for being such a hypocrite and am ready to end the relationship.  Am I overreacting?

Me: 25 (f) Him: 25 (m) 

I hope this is okay to post in this subreddit. I'll try to keep this short and too the point. I started a new job in November of this past year in a brand new area at a school teaching.

Within the past couple months I've started taking my lunch down to the teacher's lounge to eat rather than eating in the classroom during lunchtime.  From doing this I've met a guy my age who works part time as an aide in the one classroom. 

We talk every single day when he takes his break which is during my lunch period. We hung out in a small group setting (him, another person and me) a couple days ago for the first time outside of work. We had only been regularly for a few weeks at this point. 

I had a really good time and he seemed to be gravitating towards me even though another person was there.  He mentioned a movie he wanted to see and I said he should come over and watch it with me. He agreed that it sounded like fun. 

Now for my question. Should I tell him I think he's smart, funny, and cute or should I just keep being friendly and see what happens?

He's moving (not terribly far) in two months for grad school but will most likely be back. So guys would you want a girl that you've know for several weeks to be blunt or not?

The doctor ran some tests and sent me home. The next day I was still not feeling better the doctor called me to come in and said that my blood work was abnormal and that he wanted to run a ultrasound and a ct scan to find out what was causing the problem. After the tests he told me that he had found a mass on my pancreas and was going to take a biopsy. So they did the biopsy and the doctor sat me down and told me that I have pancreatic cancer that it is at an advanced stage. I asked the doctor what were my chances with treatment he told me 4%. He then went on to tell me how they were going to treat it. Surgery lots of chemo and that they would tackle it very aggressively but that the odds were still long. I asked for the night to think about it. He was reluctant but let me go and told me that if they are going to start treatment it is going to need to be very soon. came home and decided to ask reddit.

Now I haven't told anyone I didn't even tell my fiance lets call her Tiffany (27f) that I was going to the doctor because I did not want to worry her if it was nothing.

We did so because her grandmother was diagnosed with cancer of the lymphnodes that it was terminal and they gave her six months after she declined treatment.

This is not that post.  This is a post about the emotional and psychological side of oral sex.

To me, after 8 years of marriage, there is nothing more loving that a person can do than perform oral sex on their partner.  It is a complete giving of yourself to your partner because you are bring physical pleasure to your partner with no significant physical pleasure for yourself.  It's also fully accepting your partner and accepting all of your partner.  There is nothing more loving that looking into your partner's eyes as they are orgasming in your mouth.

When we were dating, I got this from my wife.  She would go down on me frequently, get me off and swallow.  I never had to ask for it.  She'd just do it.  I'd do the same for her.

Over the years, things have change.  If you belive the sterotypes, its fairly typical.  Wife became less and less interested in sex.  Blowjobs became less frequent.  She decided she didn't like me finishing in her mouth.  All pretty standard, right?

While I miss the sensation of the frequent blowjobs, what I miss more is the love that I feel from her while she's pleasuring me.  I've tried to communicate this to her, but no matter how I phrase it, she always hears ""suck my dick more"".

So, questions:
* How normal is this?  Is it as common as the jokes and stereotypes make it out to be?
* Does someone really just decide that even though ejaculate in their mouth used to be just fine, it is now digusting?  I have a real problem with this one because, since she used to willingly take me, I wonder what has changed.  It seems more logical to me that she feels differently about me (either I'm not longer worth the sacrifice, or she no longer feels the same way about me) than that she just suddenly decided she doesn't like the taste of sperm.
* I'm sure I've tried just about everything anyone can think of, but I'm welcome to suggetions as to how I might be able to convey the importance of this matter to my wife.
* Should I just drop the issue and be happy that I'm still getting a blowjob (unfortunately followed by a handjob) every 4-6 weeks?",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_lx2h5,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/lx2h5/a_twist_on_the_blowjob_debate_i_want_my_wife_to/,

Here's the OP:
http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h0cgf/i_did_an_ama_over_a_year_ago_link_in_text_and/

and here's the link to the original AMA:
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ajm2v/my_wife_had_total_global_amnesia_all_long_and/

Can't believe it's been almost a month already... I went back and looked at where I left off with the first thread and a LOT has happened…

Here's the abridged version, feel free to ask questions and I'll fill in the blanks.

She was really starting to make me nervous, kept talking about how irrational and psycho I was acting and getting more and more angry. After we had a  disagreement over something minor she threatened to call the cops 'like the officer told her to if i got irrational again'.

Went outside and called my lawyer (hadn't met yet)… told her what was going on before she jumped in and told me to GTFO now, don't pass go, don't wait for anything, just go. Told me to get the kids and stop by the local PD and tell them my lawyer advised me to GTFO and let them know what I was doing and that it was on the advice of my attorney. 

Went to the PD with the intent of just letting them know what I was doing but they wanted to chat. Turns out the officer I was speaking with had been at my house that morning. He seemed suspicious and while we talked the kids colored in the other room. Turns out they talked to my son but we told the exact same version of events. The officer left me to talk with his supervisor and when he came back his demeanor had changed. He told me my wife told him a similar version of events but without the violence towards my son... essentially she said we argued, I lunged at her (I went over to check on my son) and that I chased her up the stairs and that's why she smashed my computer (I was heading the other way to check on my son again). He was pretty sympathetic at that point and just asked that we let the PD know where we would be staying in case she called and said the children were kidnapped.

Ended up staying at a friend's house, they had two spare rooms and we had our own bathroom. She's a bit older than me and married but with no kids so she has a pretty nice place. First few nights the kids wouldn't sleep unless I was in the room or lying between them. Fell asleep with them the first night and woke up with both of them clinging to me.

The next morning I met with my attorney and we immediately went down to the courthouse and I filed a protection order against their mom on behalf of both kids. It went surprisingly quick... the magistrate heard from me before talking to my son. My attorney said it usually takes a bit longer to convince the judge a PO is in order.

Full hearing was set for the next week but until then my wife could have zero contact with the kids. That weekend I met with a local cop to drop by the house and pick up some clothes for me and the kids to find about 8 garbage bags full of our stuff in the corner of the garage. She'd thrown out a ton of our things... cloths, toys, books, medicine, you name it... and some of it was clearly mixed with garbage. I took the whole pile and threw it in my vehicle as well as anything else I could grab.

The next week we filed an abuse and neglect complaint against my wife. Thursday morning we met before the final PO hearing and decided to delay that until next week and come up some sort of temporary custody agreement that we could bring to the magistrate for the initial abuse and neglect hearing (abuse and neglect is out of the juvenile court and trumps anything from the PO, which is a simple domestic court filing). My attorney hadn't met my wife before and was shocked at how unstable she was... her speech was disjointed and my attorney could tell her thought processes were all over the place. She was up and down emotionally and practically had a panic attack when we first met... that quickly turned to sobbing and then intense anger.

We eventually came to a verbal agreement but not until both attorneys told my wife she was being completely unreasonable and the magistrate could force an agreement down her throat if need be. The agreement was to get the kids back in the house and have my parents come down to stay with them until the hearing but come next for the initial abuse and neglect hearing my wife said she's not leaving the house under any circumstances. So she stays in the house and I get full temporary custody of the kids. Even the court advocate for the kids can't believe she chose the house over fighting for visitation.  My lawyer is really happy and its a big win for me but I'm running out of leave for work and now I have to find alternate housing and daycare. 

Before this past memorial day weekend I get an email demanding visits with both kids over the weekend. The agreement was that they would be supervised, short and the court advocate would be involved for monitoring as well. Wife goes ballistic when I push back and says I'm violating a court order, etc. I explain that none of the required people have met the kids let alone talked to any of us about scheduling visits. On top of that both kids, especially my son, have been vocal about not wanting to see her. My son is extremely angry with her as am I. The more we've been away from her the more the three of us have realized how bad things were and there's nothing I won't do to protect them and make sure nothing like this ever happens again. I call my lawyer and explain what's happening and she shuts down all the talk of visits. On top of that my wife slipped and mentioned that her father was coming down to work on the house (another story) so I figured her plan was to have the kids meet her family for the first time. My wife has been estranged from her family for the last 15 years. Her mother kicked her out of the house after an argument (also slapped her up and choked her, holding her against the wall as she took her house keys from her) and she has had zero contact with them until I left with the kids. Now they've fully reconciled and she thought it would be a great idea to introduce the kids to grandparents they've never met during the same visit with a mother that abused and neglected them.

Its insane that she still hasn't had a mental evaluation and the kids and I have been in therapy the last three weeks. FYI I got a clean bill of mental health from my psych dr and he's not even recommending meds. Thinks I'm doing extraordinarily well considering everything we've been through. Kids are doing pretty well, very happy and acting like kids again... but things come up that let me know we have plenty to deal with.

So the next thing we have is a pre-trial in another two months unless my wife negotiates some plea and custody deal I find acceptable.

Ask away, I typed this up quick and I'm sure I've left tons of things out.

**Thanks to all in the OP, you were immensely valuable in keeping me sane and keeping the kids safe.**

1302158757.0,107,self.relationship_advice,gkjzg,My ex was just arrested for DUI+child endangerment,hubbyofhoarder,123,16,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gkjzg/my_ex_was_just_arrested_for_duichild_endangerment/,"My ex ( http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/bqfae/iama_guy_who_was_married_and_will_soon_divorce_a/?sort=top ) was just arrested for DUI and child endangerment.

I got a call on my cell around midnight from her; it was a ""butt dial"". She didn't speak into the phone, but I did hear what were very clearly bar noises coming from the background.  This was on a night that my ex had custody of my son, so either he was in a bar, or he was home alone (and he's 10, which would not be okay).  

I called her, asked where she was, and got no answer.  I then called the police, who waited outside while I tried to get her to come out.  After about an hour, the police left. Although they didn't believe that she was in the house, they didn't have cause to forcibly enter.  They were apologetic, and gave me some good suggestions, but eventually left.

I continued to wait outside.  After about 10 minutes, she pulled up in her car.  She passed out at the wheel.  To make a long story short, the cops came back, she was arrested, and charged with child endangerment and driving under the influence.  I got her house keys from her, entered her house, and retrieved my son.  Before he came down, I had them put her in the police car, so that he wouldn't have to see his mom in handcuffs. I took pictures of her crazy hoarder house; if I stop freaking out, I might post them.

The cop was sympathetic, and wasn't sure if the child endangerment charge would stick, but he said he'd charge her, and let the DA figure out what charges would stick. She's already on probation for another DUI she got in December, and had been admitted to an accelerated rehabilitation program.  She's going to have both sets of charges leveled against her now, and is nearly certainly going to jail, at least for a little while.

Fuck, what a night. I could really use a hug.

Update: This morning I applied for a temporary Protection from Abuse order from our local court system.  My ex is to have no contact with my son, on pain of a criminal contempt charge.  We have a final hearing on 4/18

Update 2: The advice about posting the pictures was very well received, thank you. If you want to see what this might look like, go here: http://www.ocfoundation.org/hoarding/tests.aspx .  My ex's place is like living room 7 on the pictures at the bottom of that page.

Update 3: her hearing on the child endangerment charge is today. Please, mythical man-in-the-sky-in-whom-I-don't-actually-believe, let her be bound over for trial on that charge! 

Update 4: I submitted the pics I took during the incident, and some other info to the A&amp;E show ""Hoarders.""  A producer from the show just called me, they're potentially interested in us doing the show! If she did it, they would help her clean and organize.  Hopefully my ex will agree. I have a feeling she's just going to be pissed off, though.

Update 5: Went to court this morning for the Protection from Abuse Order.  Ex offered to sign over full residential custody of my son to me, with her receiving 2 supervised visits a week, no over-nights at her house. I took her offer.  I know I've ""won"", but honestly it just feels shitty.

Update 6--I'm sure no one is still monitoring this, but in case anyone cares: things have gotten progressively worse for my ex.  She managed to get herself fired from her university job (bye-bye tuition benefits for our kid), and is currently unemployed, living in her bananas hoarder house.  My son is with me all the time now, she has 2 non-overnight visits a week.  

My ex signed papers to allow me to move with my son to a district that is one of the best in the state in which I live, and is away from her, so that I don't have to exit my apartment every day, and watch her continuing to descend into chaos.  I can't/don't want to fix her problems, but it still hurts me to watch someone who was a part of my life for nearly 20 years kill herself slowly.

Update 7--In new district, son is now getting the best grades he's ever gotten(2 A's, 1 A-, 2 B's, hooray!).  He was a little behind in his reading compared to his peers in his district, so he's getting daily help from the reading specialist.  His mom is in jail for 90-180 days.

My roommate Tony and I moved in to our place about 2 years ago. It was just supposed to be us bachelors but he met a girl a week after we moved in and moved her AND her dog in without consulting me. Whatever we're all friends of friends so i let it slide. 
Today he came to me and said, ""Hey man around October ish her and I are thinking we're gonna move on. We think you're a great guy but we just gotta check out a new place we've been here forever."" To that i said, ""Ok cool dude I'll start looking i guess."" I absolutely love my apartment so i obviously don't want to move out. Within five minutes of facebook chatting i found a new couple who will move in that same month and everything will continue per the status quo. Awesome!!

I went to him and told him that and he responded, ""Ohh ummm we were actually going to stay in the place."" WTF reddit. I have done nothing wrong and as far as i knew we were all on cordial roommate terms. Is it my responsibility to inconvenience myself for them or should i just say no. If you guys want to move out feel free I'll replace you but i intend to stay here. We are all part of a very large social circle so its not like we are CL strangers. HELP!

Edit: This couple isn't asking for their own place they want to move some other friend into my room. To say again with all honesty we are all on good roommate grounds i was really taken aback with this request. 

Edit Part Duex: For clarity the landlord knows about the dog and girl. She is absolutely furious and always bickers about it but other than that we are good quiet tenants whose rent is never late. It usually falls to me to go handle things with her because Tony is such a dick to her (straight up walking past her while shes talking, never answering her calls etc) All the calls to lawyer up, funny you would mention that, his girlfriend is taking the bar right now and has been moonlighting doing landlord property law stuff for tenants on the side! Yikes..


**Update:** I'm going to talk to him tonight. She is in full on BAR study mode and won't be there but even if she was it would be him and i having the conversation anyway. You guys have armed me with a ton of knowledge and a lot of ways to gain the upper hand but I'm going to naively have a conversation man to man about how this isn't fair because..... ----&gt;

In an interesting turn of events the landlord just came down because the room above me has a burst pipe and wanted to check my walls with the plumber. While he was doing his thing she informed me she called the doctors office where the fake service dog note came from and the doctor said he had no recollection of the dog, her, or anyone involved. I informed the landlord one of us will probably me moving soon and she said she would love to keep me if i wanted to stay! \o/ I'm feeling a lot better about this situation now as shitty as it is I'm gonna do what i always do and stay positive.

At this point i think no matter what i no longer want to live with these two. Talking to you guys had made me realize that i shouldn't have to put up with this stuff and i can have an awesome living situation with honest people if i go look for it. I feel like an abused spouse realizing i don't need to take this shit anymore haha. I will for SURE update with what ends up happening!!

She rebuffed my advance (kissing her neck softly and asking her if she would like to go to the bedroom) by telling me that she would be happy ""never having sex again"" (her exact words). I was devestated, my bottom lip hit the floor and I stared dumbly at her for 30 seconds. After talking about it she told me that she no longer has any desire to have sex with me or anyone else. She says that she finds me attractive but that she no longer feels sexual desire or gets horny. When I ask questions along the line of having her explain why she feels this way I am repeatedly told that she ""doesn't know why she feels like this"". She denies any past history of sexual assault. 


She has since cut off any sexual activities and gets openly hostile when I try to initiate. This is the culmination of a slow decline in intimacy in our marriage over the past few years. I am 33 she is 34 We have 3 children together all under 4years old and she is at home on a maternity leave while I work full time Mon-Fri. When we were dating she was full of passion and put effort into making love. She is multi orgasmic and would normally have 5-10 orgasms every time we had sex. I have never had any erectile or performance issues.


When we were making babies we were having sex twice a day until she discoved that she was pregnant, then it rapidly fell off. Since the last baby was born I tried initiating sex again after she had healed up from the delivery to limited success. She was not putting in any effort and after masturbating herself with my cock inside her in the missionary position we would then switch to doggy style until she orgasmed again and then told me to finish up quickly.


I assist with housework and child rearing a considerable amout (much more than many other husbands I know) but I could be doing more in this regard (ie waiting on them hand and foot and taking no time for myself).


In the last month she has starting spending all of her free time playing facebook games and watching television shows to the exclusion of anything else. She has a passion for playing a particular sport and will be starting this month one night a week playing it on a local recreational team.


I do not suspect her of cheating on me and have never cheated or could cheat on her. I was cheated on once by a past girlfriend and know how devestating it feels. She in not on birth control and has not been on the pill for years. Birth control has been managed surgically since the birth of our last baby. I have asked her to attend marriage counceling with me and she has agreed, we are currently trying to get something booked. I have shared with her that this attitude towards sex will probably result in the end of our marriage without significant progress in the next 2 years.


I do not understand why she has chosen to deny me the love and closeness that I need from sexual intimacy with her.


AMA or provide advice please. This situation has made me terribly depressed and I am willing to do anything and put in enormous effort to resuming a healthy relationship with her.


She posted this almost 2 years ago : [I have no sex drive - how do I get it back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/d53dc/i_have_no_sex_drive_how_do_i_get_it_back/)

Since then things have become way worse, honestly we didn't really follow thru with anything on the list with the exception of me doing more housework and putting more effort into taking the kids so she could have time off more often.

I love her more than life itself and this is killing me. Help me Reddit, you're my only hope. Crossposted to  [/r/deadbedrooms](http://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/syp03/married_4_years_my_wife_just_told_me_that_she/) and /r/relationship_advice

About a month ago, I left the house with my personal belongings after finding out my wife lied about going out drinking until 3am instead of going to the gym, which is where she said she was going.  Two days after that night out, she asked me not to go to a BBQ with her that we had been mutually invited to, and later that night drunk texted me to pick her up (I didn't, she got a ride from the host.)

4 days after I left, I drove by my house at midnight (it was payday the next day, to drain the ATM before she got to it) and long story short, walked in on her with another guy on my living room couch, totally wasted and semi-clothed.  Cops called, he left.

Since that time, wife has admitted to getting shitfaced drunk every night I was gone, sleeping with the guy in a seedy motel, waking up on the couch in the morning too drunk to take the kids to school, having her debit card stolen by another guy who slept with her on the couch.

She has previous substance abuse issues and seems to have rekindled that.  She continues to see the first guy who gives her Percocet and marijuana.  He is an ex-convict with a felony record, [45/M] who lives with his parents and is a confirmed wife beater and cheater.

Wife blames everything on me leaving initially and I assume she's doing this to get revenge.  She's asked me to come back multiple times, but continues to see him.  Tonight is the 3rd night out of the last 4 that she has left the house immediately after the kids go to bed to get drunk/high and meet him.  

Sadly, I've been reduced to driving by their known locations just to see which bar/hotel/friend's house they are meeting at... I'm beginning to be unable to think about the situation logically as nothing she is doing makes any sense to me.  We live paycheck to paycheck. I don't have any family within 100 miles.  I am the only one of both of us that has a job/insurance.

I'm seeking advice regarding custody / divorce /PFAs...  I've contacted free legal aid, I don't qualify.  I can barely afford the $150 fee to file the divorce petition and the $85 fee to file the custody petition.

Well I went over today to watch a movie with Link/cuddle/other things and before I was going to get ready to leave I ended up telling him about the message from his friend. It went sort of like this:

Me: Hey, just letting you know your bestie is a little concerned about what we've been doing here.

Link: What..?

Me: I think she's just worried you're gonna get hurt if we continue like this.

Link: How do you know this? 

Me: Well she sent me a quick message over faceb-

Link: Show me it. Now.

So he's a little red at this point. I pull out my laptop and show him the message, and his breathing gets heavy and he seems pretty upset. I tell him it's ok and I understand her concern, but he goes on to say it's none of her business. I put my arm around him as he calms down and tell him that this changes nothing and it's not his fault. After a few minutes he's laying his head on my shoulder and I kiss his head. He looks up at me and says very seriously, ""She's right about one thing. I really like you, and not just as a friend."" I say, ""Well that's good, because I like you too :),"" and making out/getting busy ensues. 

We're not official yet, but definitely going in that direction. Couldn't have shared this particular intimate moment without that girl, so kudos to his friend, haha. He said he's going to talk to her, but I told him to go easy and I think he will. Pretty much everything continues to be awesome.

Thanks for the advice, guys! :)

I was hesitant/proud at first to come here … thinking that I could always figure things out on my own. However I’ve come to realize that part of growing up also involves asking for help/advice … even if from strangers. Thus… thank you in advance.

**LONG BACKGROUND STORY IS LONG.**

Ex (F), and I (M) started out as friends. This quickly led into flirting from my side, it came out natural. Then **there was this crazy connection between us** which led us to become great friends. With time that friendship started to develop as we started getting closer to each other. I would never have thought that this sweet, sexy, intelligent girl could become such a special person in my life. **She had become more of a friend that my childhood BFF (M)**.  Until she came along he’s been the one who knows me like the back of his hand. There was nothing that he and I couldn’t talk about. He’s always pulled through for me when I needed him, and vice-versa. 

Now it was her whom I’d confide in; I would listen to her problems and give her the best advice I could. We would spend time together, and it was always fun.  Then the time came where the flirting got intense, it shifted from words to holding/playing with each other’s hands whilst watching tv. Had it been any other girl I would have asked her out right then and there. However, here we are talking about someone so special that **I was afraid to lose that connection we had if things ever went sour**.


Ultimately it happened, she had to make it really obvious that she was interested in me … I noticed sometimes but decided to ignore it … because **I never believed that starting a relationship with a friend would be a good idea … and oh boy was I wrong**. After hanging out one night, she made the first move … at first I was hesitant to kiss her, but then I abandoned myself into the feeling and we ended up making out (quite heavily too, as all that bottled-in feelings came rushing out). From that day onwards we got to know each other better. 


We started spending more and more time together, and we would never get sick of each other. We tried keeping it a secret at first; it spiced things up … in some aspects the sneaking and hiding made things more exciting. I tried to delay having sex with her as much as I could (believe me it was really hard to do … she is always been so damn sexy!) … and when we finally did have intercourse, we went nuts with it … it was like finding a new thing which we could do to have fun together (yay!). **Eventually after some thinking I asked her to become my GF, and you can’t imagine how happy I was when she agreed to it**. 


Time went on, we would spend whole days together doing pretty much anything, we share so many interests including music, we’re both geeky and we get each other so well. Even when we were apart we would make sure we’d talk every day no matter the time difference. **I guess to the eyes of an objective observer, we were grossly cutesy with each other**. Communication had never been an issue with us, even when we argued we never fought, always tried to keep calm and deal with things in an educated manner. There was nothing we wouldn’t talk about and we managed to see things in a similar way. I think it was this ability of integrating to each other’s life which made things so smooth.


**I knew then that getting into a relationship with her was the right choice and I was happy with it, however I could never shake away the fact that I kept treating her as a friend first and foremost**. A few months passed and even though I felt so strongly for her, **we still hadn’t said “The Big Three” to each other**. Simply because I don’t think it is right to say something if you’re not sure about it.
Our rough spots occurred when we had to switch into an LDR, but we always managed to keep the relationship alive regardless of how hard it seemed to get. One of these LDR’s was quite hard, she felt that I wasn’t being sweet enough to her, and I felt helpless as I have difficulty in showing my feeling from far away. It started to really play around with my head, what did I really feel for this girl? Was I having second thoughts? And **seeing how everything else between us had gone by so quickly, (in the sense that since that first kiss… we moved forward insanely fast), I wanted to make sure that saying “I love you” would be something special**. 


Time went on and I still couldn’t shake off the whole friend thing. We reached the point were now we were dreading the day when college was going to end. She asked me on different occasions “what was my plan”, and I always told her that we would deal with things as they came. I didn’t know what I was thinking. So **ultimately we both decided to break it off, neither of us spoke up to try and make it work**.


**HERE IS WHAT'S UP NOW.**


**We went our separate ways, and stayed very good friends. Maybe too much so, we still talked to each other in the same way we did as when we were in the LDR gaps**. Never really had a feeling that it was over, there was a lingering hope that we’d try again as soon as we’d deal with some things. A couple of months went by and we started making new friends etc. **I offered to take some time apart for her to try to spend some more time with her new friends**. I felt as if she needed to invest some time in those friendships, go out and have some fun. 


During that time apart, I too passed the time with my friends and we had fun. They tried to introduce me to girls and whatnot, but I was simply not interested. My mind wasn’t looking forward to spending time with another girl … even if one seemed to show interest. So I gave some thought to the whole thing … at first I thought I was just being reminiscent of the past and looking at it through rose goggles. As the days went by, I started seeing things so much clearer. I couldn’t understand how I could have been so blind, so stupid, so damn childish. 


I realized through time that this girl was not only someone with whom I had such a special connection with… this girl had become someone I’d come to love. **I was so fixated with the fear of losing our friendship that I kept myself from really seeing things for what they truly were**. Essentially I lied to myself … and shelled in my feelings so that I wouldn’t get hurt? **how could I have become so selfish?** Who was this hypocrite who stared me through bathroom the mirror? I gave it more thought. I tried to detach myself from it by trying to keep myself busy, but ultimately I found this to be true. 


I talked to her again and I confessed to her everything. **I told her how I felt about everything, and that I was willing to give it a second shot**. That I was not looking forward to pick up from where we left off. That she had all the right to be skeptical about me, but that I want to show her how much she means to me. 


I’d like to believe I always was good to her, **I have made many mistakes in my life, but this is the one I truly regret**. I’m ready to take full responsibility for my actions (or lack of them). As much as it may hurt to not see how far things could go between us (if we do give it a second chance), I’m glad to have told her how I truly felt. I would hate to give up on this romantic campaign on my own accord because of how I feel, and because of how stubborn I am.


I wish I hadn’t taken so long to realize things, but I can’t bring myself to close this door until I know for a fact that there is nothing there. 


**TL;DR= Ex and broke up after approx two years (including some LDR gaps). I’m penitent for not having realized things earlier and I’d like to give it a second shot. I humbly ask for some advice on how to proceed with this.**


P.S. - It's been 6 months since we broke up.

So, I got a reply:

""The more there are things happening in my life that interest or excite me, the less time I devote to thinking about our future together. I still dwell on the things in your present, but even then I ponder the tribulations you face, thinking of 'you' increasingly less of 'us'. I am now more in love with the prospect of army training, of future deployment, of how it might change and shape and strengthen me. I think more and more of my future with the army.

 You see, its not you who is self absorbed, but me. I constantly need to be able to justify myself to my self; something that no amount of laudit or love from another can hope to achieve. The army can satisfy my energies and my ego and my need to do things; above all else my compulsion to sacrifice, in a way that no relationship can.""

SCREW THE ARMY...

EDIT: I've just been on the phone to him for an hour, he said that in the last 6 months or so his priorities have changed. Once he could see himself settling down, having kids, getting married etc etc but now he doesn't feel like that would satisfy his need to feel some worth. He said that being a husband, or a father wouldn't necessarily give him a reason to get up in the morning, whereas being in the army would. He is jealous of people who can do that. My reply to him was, ""Dude, when you are in a relationship where your main perogative to get up in the morning is to support, love and care for her, then you know you have got the right one. I am sorry that I didn't mean that to you""

In some ways I feel intensely sad about this. I still love the guy, and therefore you don't want them to go down this route. But as he said to me, I am not going to change him. Precisely. I am not, but it still sucks. At least he has the balls to admit this to himself and to me. I owe him that at least

I can't burden any of my friends with this crap and those I have told have given me bullshit advice like ""stay strong and wait it out!"" I need your help, please, reddit.

**tl;dr** *Dad has gone through crazy personality changes after brain surgery. Neither of my parents know how to cope -- he thinks he's right and she can't get past the fact he's so different. They want my advice and I don't know what to do, or if there is anything I can do.*



**Background context**
Out of nowhere at the beginning of January,  my father started getting dizzy and was unable to keep his food down. He was out of work for a few days and finally went to the ER. They found a brain tumor and were able to operate. We were told that, worst case, he'd lose his ability to walk and might have to eat from a tube, as the tumor was in a location that controlled mobility and gag reflexes/swallowing. When he woke up, he was fine! He was able to eat, to walk, the works. But then we started noticing the other differences... the personality differences.



**Personality changes**

* *Old dad - Moderately religious:* He'd go to church on Sundays, but not if he had a golf tournament. He knows my brother and I are non-religious so he didn't try to push it on us. He'd bring up biblical references when anecdotally relevant, but never tried to preach or convert us. 
* *New dad - Born-again crazy religious with a God complex:* I know this is kind of common with people who have near-death experiences, but he calls himself the ""Version J"", as in the 2.0 Jesus version of himself. He says weird things like ""God is good!"" and ""Amen!"" and ""Hallejulah, praise the lord!"" and all kinds of phrases he's never said in his life.  And you cannot have ONE conversation with him without it turning to religion. He even yelled at the preist from the audience one Sunday, ""Cut through the bullshit! Get to the word of God!"" 
(Ok, kind of funny... but gets me to point two...)

* *Old dad - quiet, reserved, shy, polite* - He used to be so sweet and quiet. He never questioned authority and never went out of his way to cause problems for other people. He always tried to be as much of an inconvenience as possible. He would get really uncomfortable when my brother and I (both in our 20s) talked about things like sex, even in a joking context. Example: My brother mentioned something at Christmas about that one monkey that masturbates, and my dad was so uncomfortable he had to leave. He was polite, mellow. But now...
* *New dad - loud, obnoxious, rude* - It's like he has no filters now. He mentioned something about his ""hard on"" when watching a TV show -- totally out of character. He went to the ER and walked around introducing himself to everyone in the waiting room and blessing them. He was making people so uncomfortable that the receptionist had to assign him to a bed to get him out of people’s way.  He yelled at the priest at church (or pastor... whatever you call that guy in the front of Catholic churches who wears a dress). He never stops talking. And he doesn’t listen. It’s all about him. He tells us we’re all too stupid to understand what he’s going through. He calls my mom an ungrateful bitch and has no sensitivity sensors to understand what she’s going through. He told me that if I don't come out of this whole experience as a believer in God, then his brain tumor would have been a waste and I would have put him through it for nothing. (then, when I cried, he got super happy and praised the lord, thinking he had ""absolved me of my sins""). OH AND HE ALSO NEVER SHUTS THE F UP. Which is kind of nice, if he talked about things that made sense. But he talks for hours and hours and hours on end about weird things like the best way to eat soup or prune a flower. 

* *Old dad - very logical, smart, rational* - He works in IT for the State of California. He came to the U.S. when he was in his 20s, so his English is a little shaky, but he’s extremely smart. He’s worked for Boeing, did aeronautical work for MacDonald Douglas. He’s very engineering and math oriented. I never thought he was stupid or made bad judgment calls in life.
* *New dad - irrational, paranoid, makes no fucking sense* - A few examples: While bed-ridden, he emailed all his bosses and his bosses bosses to tell him he came up with some solution at work. He works for the prison system in the state of California, so this means he emailed some really high-up people in the state. He emailed this ridiculously crazy-long rambles that made no sense and basically spammed the fuck out of them. This was to like 30+ people, which got him and his boss in some trouble.  He’s tried calling all the congressmen in California to tell them he came up with the solution to the debt crisis. He seriously believes he’s found it, but won’t tell anyone else about it because he doesn’t want us to steal his idea. He’s tried to get in touch with my friend who works in Congress to see if she can connect him with the president. He has asked my brother and myself to quit our jobs to help him with his startup. We don’t know exactly what the startup is, but from the weird use cases he’s explained to us in snippets, it sounds like Craigslist meets the IRS meets Flickr meets the Bible -- and that’s only “one-onehundredth” of the idea. He always thinks he’s right about everything and if you attempt to question his logic, even for the mere point of moving the conversation foward, he becomes irrationally defensive and brushes it off as us not having the knowledge to comprehend his high-level thinking. 

We try to rationalize with him. I try to understand the new way he sees the world and I try not to treat him like he’s crazy, even though I really do think he’s acting crazy. I listen to his startup ideas, and so does my brother. We listen to his new philosophies about how to live life and try to connect with them and relate to them where it makes sense. But we try to do this without enabling him. Hours on the phone listening to his rants. And as soon as we say ""Ok, it's 1 a.m. and we've been on the phone for five hours and I have to wake up at 6:00 for work so I should go"" he gets really mad and says that we're not worth his time and we don't deserve to hear his ideas since we're not fully committed. Says things like, ""But if you could possibly change the world by hearing my ideas, why WOULDN'T YOU skip a night's sleep to hear that?"" There's no rationalizing.

So these are just a few examples. And yes, I know that these changes are normal in someone who just had their skull sawed open, part of their brain removed. The brain is a tricky thing.  But now it’s at the point where it’s going to cause my parents to get a divorce. And that's a big deal. That's something we can't ""brush off and wait out.""



 **What’s happening now.**

So, now it’s getting really tense between them. My mom’s home all day trying to take care of him, but he’s really mean and insensitive to her. As a result, she gets frustrated and it all devolves into arguments. All day. Every day. Crying. Punching walls. Name calling. 

Here are a few snippets from both of my parents’ sides of the issue. Of course, they both see themselves as the victims in this situation.

An email my dad wrote to my mom. I tried to clean up the writing where I could but some of it still doesn’t make sense, sorry: 
&gt; I do the things I do believe it or not with the intention of making things better.  Until you believe that and are willing to listen to my cries, and what my words really mean when I say them to you.  My intentions were always how to make things better [...] It seems because of the changes that I have gone through, I have been called names, gotten that “you're weird” look, accused of being crazy (even retarted),  not taken seriously, pitied, yelled at.  People in general, wanted the old me, and I don't know or I don't want the old me.  For whatever reason behind it, I was brought back to this World with this new me, and for reason I'm not so clear yet.  It's more natural for me to behave with the new Ben.  I feel like I am not myself if I acted the old way. The new Ben had already had already accomplished a lot in the last month that I like.  Instead of being appreciated, is this the price I have to  pay for acting the way I feel I should be acting.  The way I feel that I am normal.

So, yes, he’s senses that we think he’s gone off his rocker, but he thinks he's in the right and that he makes sense and that he's better this way. But he is also a huge asshole but completely incapable of realizing that he’s an asshole. It's so so sad. Here’s another email he sent my mom to explain, logically, why he called her an ungrateful bitch. Please note that he doesn’t apologize:

&gt; Why did I call you an ""ungrateful bitch""? I called you that because you don't seem to realized that I have unconditional love for you.  You don't realized that the things I do for you are unconditional.  I don't expect anything in return, that's why you don't hear me complain about it.  I am saying it here now because I want you to realize all the things that I have done that had gone unnoticed.  You know I used to get mad easily, and you asked me that I should change and control my temper.  I think I have done a good job and done that for you.  It makes me happy that I can control my temper better now than when we first got married.

When you hear this side, it seems all good and well, but then you hear my mom’s side and you can sympathize with her, too. Here’s an excerpt:

&gt; I don't know how much longer I can do this. There is nothing I can do right. From the moment we found out about that fucking tumor to this minute I have done nothing but piss you off. I tried to care for you, you pushed me away. I tried to voice my opinions about your health, you told me to shut up. I try to talk to you, you turn it into an argument or you don't even hear what I say because you are already formulating your comeback.  I leave you alone, stay out of your way and speak only when necessary,   you call me sulky, pissy, mad. I have tried and tried. No matter what I say or do you question it. Why did I say it like that? What does that mean? Even a simple 'good morning"" causes you to get mad at me. [ …] The only time we talk is when we are fighting.  I don't know how to be normal around you anymore. I'm afraid to do or say anything because I know how it is going to turn out. I can't put on a happy face and say everything with enthusiasm and cheerfulness like you want. I try to be supportive and encouraging but the more I try the harder you knock me down.

And more about that ‘ungrateful bitch’ line:

&gt;You say I'm an ungrateful bitch because I am not rejoicing in your recovery, the new you, your new outlook on life. It is hard for me to feel happiness when you constantly shut me out.  I am grateful you are alive, more than you will ever know. I am grateful you have your memory, or most of it anyways. I am grateful you are walking and talking. I am grateful for you.  I carry so much guilt because I can see myself, hear myself get angry with you. Yes, I scream and yell. Today, I hit the wall. I don't know how to get through to you. I hate being this miserable, sad, insecure, weak person. 


**What I’ve tried to do**

I am so, so sad for my dad. He really is being hurtful and a little bit out-of-his mind, but he honestly can’t see it. He really thinks the way he’s acting is OK. I’ve tried giving him simple tips when he’s called me in completely desperation after making my mom cry. I’ve told him simple things like, “Listen to her when she talks. Don’t interrupt. Actually listen to the words out of her mouth and wait until she ends a sentence before you start talking.”  Of course, he hasn’t been able to do that. He really does know something’s wrong and he really does want to change, but he’s not capable right now. 

I’m also sad for my mom because she’s at home dealing with all this alone right now. This guy, her husband, is a complete stranger and she’s supposed to live with him and take care of him. He doesn’t kiss her anymore or talk to her. He tells her she’s stupid and a bitch and she loses her temper. I’ve tried to tell her to be patient and to remember that he’s a different person right and to try to do any small things to bring him back to reality (bring out his guitar, reference old memories, etc). But that’s super easy for me to say when I’m on the outside. 

**In conclusion**

My mom started her own bank account and moved some money over in case she needs to get away. All they do is yell and scream at each other. They’re both incredibly unhappy right now and are asking me for help. I’ve never been married! I have my own problems to deal with at work and in my own life. In a way I feel selfish because it’s like, “Hey, you two are adults. I didnt ask to be involved in this! It’s not my problem.” But that’s not the kind of person I am. I have to do something. I just don’t know what. I’ve suggested couple’s therapy but no one will take them since my dad recently had brain surgery it somehow disqualifies them from that (or that’s what they tell me).

Does ANYONE have advice? What should I do? Anyone have experience with brain tumor patients who have had a simliar about-face? Did it end well? How do I help them both keep happy and understand each other? ANYTHING PLEASE.

xoxo,
sad, confused, desperate reddior.

*edit 2: You all are the best. thank you. I'm going to try recommending, again, that they get more help from a neurologist and psychiatrist. My father in particular has been pretty stubborn about this because he thinks he's OK, but if he's really willing to do what it takes to make it work with my mom, perhaps he'll reconsider. I'm also going to show my mom this thread so she can get the strength she needs to get him the right help, as she's the legal caretaker and the only one capable of making appointments.*

1333994209.0,106,self.relationship_advice,s13ur,"My boyfriend had lewd photographs of his exes on his computer, and also some of my sister...",makesmewannapuke,132,26,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/s13ur/my_boyfriend_had_lewd_photographs_of_his_exes_on/,"So, I tried to find a similar situation on here and couldn't come up with anything, so I guess I will explain the situation and see what you guys come up with.  

I'm a very laid back person.  I'm also very sexually expressive and love to do kinky things in bed and hear stories that are ""wrong"" and ""nasty"".  My boyfriend and I have been together for three years.  Over the course of these three years, we have grown a lot together, especially sexually.  We are completely compatible.  Liking BDSM, but not too crazy, and also knowing when we need to chill and just have ""normal"" sex.  It's been great being with someone, finally, that I feel I can share my sexual thoughts with and he understands.  We have a great relationship otherwise as well.  We have the occasional disagreement, but everyone does and it usually passes in under an hour.  We are both 28 yrs old and live together (along with another roommate). 
 
I met him through my sister...his, then, best friend.  Prior to this year, we actually all lived together with 3 other roommates.  At the beginning of our relationship, I was a bit suspicious that perhaps he had a crush on her.  They had been friends for so long, it was a little intimidating!  He reassured me that he held no romantic feelings for her and that I had nothing to worry about.  I had no reason not to believe him.  Now, this part may sound a little weird, but our group of friends is a little strange, and we behave as such.  Over the years, living together and drinking and doing various drugs (not often, but occasionally), my boyfriend and sister have kissed.  Tiny kisses, no tongue, most often to freak each other out.  I have been witness to this and laughed and definitely did not see anything more than them being creeps.  

This brings me to a few weeks ago.  I was on my boyfriend's computer...he has a desktop set up in the living-room and I usually just use this, as it's always on and we share it.  So, I am uploading a picture of a friend to put on fb and I had emailed it to myself and was putting it on the desktop to find easily.  (I give you this information because I assure you that I didn't go looking for these photos...and in no way am I a snooping girlfriend, well, until after this and now I feel as if I have to check everything).  It opened to a folder that was labeled ""p"".  I had never seen this before and was intrigued (even excited that he had some new porn that I hadn't seen), so I opened it up.  Right away, I knew I wasn't going to want to see what was in the next set of folders.  They were labeled with the letters of his exes...I recognized this at once.  I felt a pit in my stomach, as I realized that he must know these are still here, because my letter is there too, so he keeps my pics right beside these.  Curiosity got the better of me and I looked at them.  Many of them are just obscene pics you would expect a boyfriend to have.  I was obviously upset and disturbed that he had kept them this long and felt very angry because we have such an open sexual relationship.  Even if he felt the need to keep these, he could have at least spoke with me about it so this moment would never happen.  OR JUST DELETE THEM!!!  Well, I was already upset and then within one of the exes folders, along with pictures, there sat another folder.  I opened it, again, curiosity kill the cat, I know.  It was a set of pictures that my sister had obviously taken of herself topless.  I knew they were old because of her hair and features, but was mortified that my boyfriend would have these.  

I told my sister and she came over and looked at them.  She had taken them years ago for an ex and the only copies she knew existed were on her computer and perhaps, her exe's.  She vaguely remembered mentioning them in front of my boyfriend when we lived together.  Since then, I have learned that he did, in fact, go onto her computer and get the topless photos of my sister to put on his own computer.  He confessed to me that he had masturbated to all of the pictures I mentioned previously, but not in a very long time (a year at least).  
Sorry this is getting a bit long, I'll try to wrap it up.  Since I found them, I told him I needed space to think about things.  He has been in and out of the hospital with infections and the flu, so I have been there for him throughout that, and now finally have a moment to sit and think.  We have kissed a few times and been intimate once since I found these.  I can't do stuff with him without feeling like I'm going to puke.  I get physically ill after we kiss a lot and just feel utterly disgusted.  I don't know if I can ever get over this.  Has anyone else experienced anything similar?  What did you do to get past this?  I realize the possibility is there that we will just have to break up.  I don't know...my sister is very upset still as well.  She isn't speaking with him at the moment and I know that's hurting him a lot (as it should).  I love him, and I would love to get over this and put it behind us, I just don't know if I can.  

Any advice would be welcome.

I am around 6 inches length, 5in girth, so I guess on the average, but I still feel terrible. I know it's not my fault to have not enough down there but I still feel like crap. I want her to be satisfied with sex.

IM GOING CRAZY!


UPDATE: ok here's the story... I met up with her and friends for  trip to a natural water springs. I saw the condom wrapper in the trash minutes before we left. I figured I'd hold my tongue and try to enjoy the day.  2hrs each way. I'm on the way home right now stuck in major traffic, like 2hrs home is more like 4-5 hrs. we've been on the road for 2hrs already.  All day she's given me the cold shoulder and at one time her a mutual friend, in a round about way, confirmed my suspicions. this drive back has been horrible. when we get back I will demand we talk. I don't care if he's claims to be too tired. 

I'd love to do the fake SMS thing. but she left her phone at home and it would seem pointless to do it after we talk. maybe I can send one now (with my iPhone) and watch her squirm when she sees it web we get home.  any good services? preferably a service that I can get replies with. good app for that?    


I will update y'all with the news. maybe a followup post. 

I really want to be the bigger man and leave her questioning herself. I've heard the long slow realization for her is better that a momentary feel good moment of telling her off. what say you? say a bit about trust, respect, and walk away or rip her a new one?

1368763876.0,103,self.relationship_advice,1ehypn,Anal and rough sex addiction is ruining my relationship.,throwawayfor1,130,27,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ehypn/anal_and_rough_sex_addiction_is_ruining_my/,"Me, F/31; bf is 35. He has a porn addiction that ruins our sex life. He tries to reenact the demeaning porn he watches on me during sex. He is emotionally disconnected during sex. 

After finding him hitting on girls from his past on fb, asking for pictures via text from other girls, and even joining an adult friend finder site, I told him he had to go to counseling. He was diagnosed with a sex addiction and told it would take 1-2 years of therapy to kick. He went 3 times. 

He has gotten better, but the intimacy hasn't. A couple months ago I checked his browsing history because of a funny vibe I got off him and found that he was creeping profiles of 20 year old college girls on fb. I got upset and called him on it. He apologized and said he felt horrible. 

Last week I checked his browsing history again and found he was checking girls out on twitter. The porn was bad enough for me, but he can actually message girls on fb and twitter. 

He says he loves me and can't live without me, but I keep finding him doing this stuff. My trust and love is wearing thin. We don't really kiss anymore. I initiate sex and a lot of times he turns me down, even for oral sex. He says it's because he's stressed, but then I found him looking at other girls. 

After I found him looking at other girls this last time, I decided to wait before approaching him. The next day I got dolled up before going to meet a friend and then initiated sex. He still looked up girls and porn after I left. 

The kicker? I would have been gone a long time ago, effort from him or not, but we just had a baby 7 wks ago. I am already back in pre-baby shape so I know me being fat or pregnant isn't the issue. He's a good dad and I don't want to have to split up a family if I don't have to. Thoughts?

**tl;dr: Bf's porn addiction affects our sex life, and consequently our relationship. He has gotten better, but still struggles and his slip-ups hurt my trust and love. I don't feel as loving toward him as I used to and I want to leave, but we have a 7 week old son. Thoughts? Advice?**

EDIT: Just sent him this email:
You aren't going to like this email. I've done a lot of thinking while you were gone, and I've come to the conclusion that I can't be with you. You told me you would go to counseling. This was destined to be a telling point for me. You quit after 3 sessions. You never filled out the questionnaire the counselor gave you.

I don't want to be your parent. I don't want to have to constantly check your behavior. I want you to make your own decisions based off of Jacob's and my worth to you. Thus far, we've lost. I'm not mad at you because I have been where you are. I just know you aren't ready for a relationship. You love me and everything I offer you, but I'm not enough to keep you from checking out other women.

I've been agonizing a lot since I discovered you looking at girls on Twitter. I've tried to find ways in my mind to rationalize your behavior. I can't find any. There are girls who will be fine with you looking at other women on fb and Twitter as well as indulging in porn. I am not one of them. I have been completely faithful to you and even deleted potential relationship interests off fb because I was devoted to you. You have not done this. 

I have been friendly with you in our conversations because I didn't want to distract you from your season. This has been hard for me because I hate acting a lie. I can hide this lie from you no more. 

When we first began dating, I was so excited about you. I loved you almost immediately, even though there were some red flags. I viewed you with clear, excited eyes. I no longer have that unadulterated love for you. When I look at pictures of you, I see a man filled with uncontrolled lust and his cock in his hand.

You don't appreciate me. I do so much for you and it isn't returned. I want a man who showers me with love and affection and you don't. Telling me how much you love me isn't enough. It just isn't. 

I think with your porn, you are attracted to the trashy type, but crave approval from a girl who is above all of that. I am that girl. I am smart, funny, sweet, caring, thoughtful, and genuine, and I love you and give myself freely and yet you still indulge in porn of the trashy type. You have the best of both worlds. I can't give that to you anymore. 

I am looking for a job that will support Jacob and me. I will never take him from you, but I can't continue to put myself through this agony.

He explained to me she was caught shoplifting, so i excused myself at work and went over to her workplace to save face and tell them she had an emergency to attend to. That's when i found out she never was employed there. I also have a feeling she's lying about being enrolled in school. I feel confused, guilty, and I have no one to turn to for advice. At the moment all i can do is wait while they give me more info about when she will be released.

Edit: I was just notified that she is going to see a judge in about an hour to approve a pr bond. if its approved she will be released 4-6 hours later. We live alone and all our family is 300+ miles away. I know she wouldn't want me to tell her family nor mine, but Im thinking that sweeping it under the rug is not a good thing.

When I asked her about why she lied about working she explained that she felt uncomfortable because she was the only woman working with men who were much older than her.

He was amazing until we got married, which is when things began to go downhill. He is in the Navy, I stay home with the kids, so he is gone a lot. After we married, I found things on the computer that were disturbing; he had been talking to other women, including his ex, and young girls as young as 13 years old (on dating sites, facebook, craigslist). I didn't know how to react at first because he is the father of my children and I didn't want to put him in jail (for talking to children), I wanted to confront him. He admitted it and admitted he had a problem and agreed to get help. Fast forward a few months, I catch him trying to talk to other Navy wives, he does the same thing and cries and apologizes and blames it on his sexual addiction and he goes into therapy. I don't have a job, and basically am totally dependent on him (I know, big mistake) and my family can not help me or take us in. Yesterday I found out that when he was 13, he had sex with his little sister who was 9 at the time and he continued having sex with her for 6 years. He said he stopped having sex with her once we were together, which I don't know if I believe. His whole family lied and covered it up and his mother never got him help for him but she now says she has only known about it for the past few years. What disturbs me the most is that they kept it a secret and we have children together. My oldest son who is 5, was showing signs of abuse starting at the age of 2 and now I am questioning whether he has done something to our son or not. I don't know what to do, or how to move forward, I am freaking out and I need some honest opinions on what to do...Feel free to ask anything if it would help with any advice.

a throwaway account here, just wanted to discuss this with someone. My wife, 30/f, hits me. It's not terribly brutal, but we're both physically fit, and her punch packs enough power to leave a bruise. 

She usually punches my chest or shoulder about six or seven times, or kicks me in the leg or hip to knock me over. It happens when she's stressed or tired (we're both overworked), and over seemingly minor things (like her disagreeing with my opinion on some daily issue.)

This bothers me deeply, not just the pain,  but the insult. 

When I talk to her, she laughs it off, saying a *real man* can take some venting from his woman. She tells me to stop being a pussy.

It's also chipping away  at my temper. I found myself restraining her arms and pushing her away from me, shouting at her. That makes her cry, and she calls me an abuser. It breaks my heart, because I would never *hit* a woman.  

I don't want to leave her.  I think she's just so stressed and overworked. But, I do need some perspective on this.

Am I being a pussy for minding this?
Am I turning into an abuser myself?
Where to get help?

1335975266.0,101,self.relationship_advice,t3g4m,"Reddit, our new neighbor is borderline harassing us because of the ""noise"" we make.  What to do?",lilmonkey99,121,20,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/t3g4m/reddit_our_new_neighbor_is_borderline_harassing/,"TL;DR: Our neighbor has left us angry notes, banged on our floor, called security on us 3 times and left a nasty voicemail on my boyfriends phone.    I believe the ""banging"" she says we do is us simply walking around our apartment. Any advice would be helpful.

Me, 27F and my boyfriend Ted 32M have been dating for 2.5 years.  I recently moved into his co-op, only about a month ago.  Since then, things with us have been wonderful.  Things with our neighbor, however, have not.  I'll take this time to say how this is not her apartment.  It's her cousin Paul's apartment, whom Ted has had a nice relationship with before.  Apparently she is staying there because he goes away on business a lot.

The first interaction we've had I will take responsibility for.  It was late on a Thursday night/Friday Morning, we had just come home from our bowling league and we were up for a little while BSing.  I had just bought new shoes and was excited so I was wearing them, not thinking how it might affect our neighbor downstairs.  

Well at one point we heard banging on our floor, her ceiling.  We quieted down, I took the shoes off and we basically went to bed from there.  Next morning there was a note slipped under our door basically saying how loud we were, how she has kids and how she didn't appreciate us walking around in high heels at 2 am.  I felt horrible, my boyfriend basically said not to worry, just take shoes off as we enter the apt and basically live and learn (this is my first time living in an apt building, not a house).  

Later on that day when I get home from work there is another note taped to our door saying ""Paul says call him within 24 hours or he's going to call management"" I told Ted, He called Paul.  They spoke for a while, Ted apologized to him and told him he would go downstairs and apologize to her.

At this point he explained to her that we get home late on Thursdays but we will do our best to keep it down as to not disturb her.  She understands.  He also makes a point to tell her that we may have guests over on weekends but never later than 1 or 2.  She understood and from what he said, was pretty friendly.

2nd interaction:  One Friday night we have 4 friends over.  We were playing games at our dining table with the LA/VAN game on in the background.  The TV is no louder than any other night.  The table has a carpet under it but it doesn't go out too far.  At one point a friend pulled out her chair, it made a noise.  I asked her to pick up her chair so it wouldn't disturb the neighbor.  She accidentally did it one more time.  They were gone by 1:30 and the boyfriend and I went to bed.  

Next day comes and another note... this one a little more aggressive.  It went somewhat along the lines of ""It's 1 am and I am disturbed by you again with chairs being pulled out and the TV blasting.  At this point don't bother coming downstairs to say sorry cause you must think you got game.  Well I'm gonna go down to management and that's gonna be the final game.  Don't bother coming down or calling because I'm done talking.""  My boyfriend and I are pretty livid at this point.  This woman basically expects us to be silent in our own apartment.  He tells me to not do anything, if she doesn't want to talk, we won't talk.  If management says anything, we'll explain our side.

Weeks go by and not a thing until Monday night.  We had spent the whole day (9am-7pm) moving my furniture over.  I spent an hour putting the bedroom together, watched HIMYM and then we wanted to put one piece of furniture together (a nightstand) before we ate dinner.  The nightstand didn't take any hammering or anything until the end when putting together the drawers and the back but before we were done there was a ring of the doorbell.  It was security.  He told us he's been getting noise complaints about this apartment.  I calmly told him it's only 9:00, we're building a nightstand and will be done in 5 minutes.  He said ok.  We were done in 5 minutes like we said.  We continued to eat dinner and I got in the shower.  

While getting out I hear the doorbell ring.  It was the same security guard saying the same thing.  Noise disturbance, saying we are banging around.  My boyfriend told him we were just eating dinner and I'm in the shower.  Security guard leaves.  Eventually we go to bed.

Yesterday afternoon after my boyfriends gets home from work, he sees the security guard.  Apparently this woman has left dozens of messages complaining about us.  He said they were going to have a talk with her.  Well I don't think they did because at 1:30 in the morning, while we were in bed, security rings the bell.  My boyfriend gets out of bed and answers it.  He said the same thing as always.  Noise complaints about banging.  My boyfriend opens the door all the way to show that the apartment is dark and that we are in bed.  The security guard says ok and leaves.  We go to sleep.

This morning my boyfriend wakes up and tells me he has a voicemail from the neighbor.  It went kinda like this 

""YO this is your neighbor from downstairs.  You have disturbed me and my children for the last and final time.  The banging at 1:30 in the morning is unacceptable. I guess you think its a game and that's why you would lie to my face and you say you are sorry and you continue to do what you do.  At this time I'm calling managements office.  I'm going to make an arrangement to speak to them face to face because you and your girlfriend are gonna stop the nonsense.  I don't know what crap you did while Paul was here but you know what Paul is not here now.  I'm here and I'm going to be respected.  Just like I respect others around me, you're gonna learn to respect me and stop the noise at 1:30 in the morning.""

Now like I said, we were in bed by 1.  Except for the one time Ted went to get a glass of water.  The only thing I can think of is she thinks that us walking around our apartment is us banging.  At this point Ted sent an email to management explaining the situation because it seems nothing short of getting to bed by 11 and silent is going to make this woman happy.

So my question is, What are my options here?  Have you been in a similar situation?  How can I prove to this woman that it's really just us walking around.  Thanks in advance.

UPDATE: The property manager spoke with my boyfriend.  He said that when security gets a complaint they are obligated to go to the apartment in question and ""access the situation"".  The property manager said we're in the clear, that our complaints are noted and that he understands our point and that he can't even speak to her because she's just a renter, not the owner.  They decided that if there is another problem we are to contact Paul and tell him the problem, maybe he can explain to her that our apartment is in compliance with the lease (as far as carpeting and whatnot) and at this point we aren't doing anything wrong.  Worse case scenario is if she keeps contacting security and they keep coming here we can call the police and bring them into it because at this point it's considered harassment.

UPDATE #2: It's 11:30 pm on Wednesday.  Doorbell just rang yet again.  It was security saying that they're getting complaints that there's ""a lot of movement"".  At this point the only movement was me moving the 20 feet from the bedroom to the couch.  We'll be calling Paul tomorrow.

She was going to stay out at her sisters last night but she came back at 3am after a big chat session with one of her old friends and we chatted for hours to try and work it out.

She will continue the counselling and approach her weight issue and has promised to be more understanding in the bedroom, her main issue as far as housework is that she feels she does enough and needs me to help, and when i do help not to do a half assed job. I asked her to provide me with a list of the chores that she will not do and that I will do them every weekend without fail. 

This looks like I am letting her 'win' here, and in a way I am, but I need her to break out of this depression and I will do all it takes.

Background: 
Im 31, wife 24, have 2 kids aged 4 and 2.
I work 5 days a week, she stays at home. 
2 year old in daycare 3 days per week. 
4 year old in school 4 and half days a week
Married 3 years.

about me:
I have always had ED. Cannot have sex without viagra/cialis. Recently confirmed low testosterone which I am in treatment for but doesnt seem to be helping much.

My sex drive is low, which I can blame for sure on my testosterone levels but I also feel the stress in my job is also not helping.

about her
flunked out of college shortly after we got together
put on a lot of weight since she got pregnant with the first child
she is depressed, doesnt have any friends apart from a sister who lives reasonably close by
ambition to do 'something'; she doesnt know what yet

my issue with her:
I work all day every day in a very tough but well paying job.
This afforded us the luxury of her not having to work and could stay home with the kids. The plan was when the kids were both in school that she woiould go back to school and get a degree in something so she could get a fulfilling job. 
Meanwhile, she takes her responsibilites as a stay at home very lightly and will often dump the 2yo in daycare then go home and spend the whole day watching tv. This has gotten worse and worse as time goes on until recently I had enough and called her on it recently. 

My argument is that if I am working it is not unreasonable for me to expect 10-15 hours per week of housework from her.
Her argument: fuck you I am not going to do that demeaning stuff, why dont you do half of it

I vented my spleen and told her that I think she is being lazy and making me feel like I am being used for money

She countered with ""if you wanted to have sex more I wouldnt feel so shit and would do the cleaning""

Maybe that's true, but I explained that it is hard for me to feel in the mood after I get home exhausted  from working all day and with all the added stress and resentment that she is causing me by not doing her share.

She then says that shes had enough of me not wanting to fuck her.

It's a catch 22, she is saying she doesnt want to do housework because I am not attracted to her and I feel unattracted to her because she takes advantage of me.

AM I being an asshole in expecting her to do stuff around the house?
Is it really possible that this kind of stress could be affecting my libido?

After going to therapy, the therapist was extremely concerned about my health and had me come back in for another appointment two days later. He all but told me to leave my husband.

I sincerely don't WANT to leave him, but I am. I am absolutely forcing myself to. My sister and mother are flying in tomorrow and helping me pack, and then we are driving across the country this coming weekend with my cats in the car. I made them promise to bring my Harry Potter book so I can read it out loud in the car.

I gave him almost 4 years to make living thousands of miles away from my family worth it, and he hasn't. We've had good times, but he makes me feel like an accessory to his life by yelling at me every day.

He is currently texting me and has been for an hour, BEGGING me to stay and go to counseling. But i have already booked plane tickets and moving trucks. I've been begging him to stop treating me like this for years and he hasn't stopped. Now I am SO, SO MAD that he has waited until it comes to THIS to claim he is going to change.

I don't really know if I need advice, but I could really, desperately use some reassurance that what I'm doing is right. He is making me feel like an absolutely horrible person for leaving.

She was a great girl who just has a lot to figure out for herself.  I hope that she can find happiness and I hope that she will grow from this experience too.  I wish nothing but the best for her.  I don't think i'll be getting with another girl like this though.  I really do deserve better than that.  I gave it my best shot and fought for it.

Now is quitting. What do I do?* How can I help?

I have known this family for about 5 years now and they have been lovely to me since I taught their eldest son, then their younger daughter and son. The daughter has since graduated and has always looked to me as a ""big sister"" type figure and we have grown quite close. 
I knew there was a lot of conflict amongst this otherwise glossy family at the end of the year. I also had noted that one of the things she told me about her new house/room that was exciting was a lock on her door. I thought it was weird but anyway. 
After a long discussion as a response to me planning on inviting her family to my son's birthday it came out that her brother had been sneaking into her room at night since she was 8 until 18 and raping her. Motivated by her boyfriend who found out she told her parents. 
They disbelieved her but eventually put a lock on the door and pay for her to see a psychologist. 
That's it. 
She wasn't feeling good about her psychologist, thinking that she felt worse than before. I tried to assure her that this was normal. 
But then her Dad said the caring side had disappeared and she had turned into a B-- since going to counselling. 
So she's quitting. 
And she won't see someone else.

Since then there's been a lot of talking and I'm pretty sure we've come to a solution, mostly thanks to everyone giving me advice. 

I set down the rules, made sure that he understood that if anything like this happens again, if he ever lies again or deliberatly keeps things from me I'm out. Also, if he doesn't cut contact with the other girl, I'm out. I'm not going to tolerate any more shit from him. I made it crystal clear that I really deserve to be treated better (which I know now thanks to you guys). I also told him that if he isn't 100% sure that it's me he wants to be with, I'd be gone. 

I feel a bit bad about being so firm and alpha since I'm not really that kind of person (way too kind and forgiving etc etc) but I know that it is neccessary if I ever want to feel happy again with this guy. And I do, I really really do. 

So right now at least things are looking better, and I don't have that horrible gnawing feeling inside of me any more. I just hope that he keeps his end of the deal.

Story:


I am very depressed currently, because of the fallout with my family, stressing over bill, being unable to attend school right now... And feeling insecure.


My boyfriend said negative things about my body in the past that have really hurt me. It makes it hard to believe the positive things he says now, really.



Well, that's what the argument was basically about. He told me that he didn't feel a lot of love or lust or joy in the relationship earlier this week, and that's what I was discussing with him. I wasn't being very calm or rational at the moment. I was sobbing, basically the whole time. He was telling me that he didn't mean that, or any of the other stuff he said and he thinks I'm beautiful and it's really annoying to have this conversations with me because I tell him that he doesn't really think that and bring up something else he said that was the opposite. I told him he wouldn't have said the negative so much if he didn't think that they were true.



He says I see him at the best of times and the worst when he doesn't want anyone around. Also that we just need a healthy amount of space, like me going out and meeting people so he can have his alone time. I told him that I was working on that, but if he needed alone time he was more than welcome to go to a different area of the house and I wouldn't bother him. He says he would rather be able to have the whole house to himself for a while, but that the other way is okay.



Anyway, the argument progressed, until he said whatever he said that hurt my feelings, and I tossed my shoes. Literally only a few feet and not with any force. He thought I was trying to throw them at his fish tank and freaked out. The rest of the story is in TL;DR, I don't want to type it again.



Anyway. Is there any chance this is a one time thing? It is partially my fault for purposely trying to annoy him, and for not leaving after he hit my head in the wall and provoking him further. It was really late, and he thought I was hurting his things. I don't get the punch to the face though..


He apologized and we spent the rest of the night together, he was coldish but not that bad. We feel asleep cuddling. He was sweet this morning. I don't want to lose the only person I have in the world. I work from home and have horrible social anxiety, so while I'm trying to make friends, it's a long process for me. But, more than that, I love him so, so much. He is very kind a lot of the time, and we have similar interests. When we are doing well, we're so good. I feel like we can rise above this and it will work out.


TL;DR Last night, my boyfriend and I were arguing. He was getting really frustrated and he was tired. He said something that hurt my feelings, can't remember what it was now and I responded by tossing my shoes a few feet from me to annoy him, so he grabbed my head and hit it into the wall. After I went over to him, freaking out about what he did, he wrestled me to the ground, punching me in the shoulder, then round house punched me in the face so hard I saw stars and my face swelled up twice its normal size. I now have a black eye, but the swelling went down.


I can't afford to pay the rent without him, and he is the only person that I have. Literally. My family and I are not on speaking terms currently. Not because of him, something else, and I have no friends.

After all, I was in the hospital...",iamroosh,115,21,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g6evp/should_i_be_angry_with_her_after_all_i_was_in_the/,"I guess the title is a rhetorical question... I'm already angry. I just don't know if I should be. 
 
I went to the hospital this morning. I was choking on phlegm in the back of my throat and nose and just could not breathe. The lack of oxygen was making me dizzy too. I called the tele-nurse, thinking it'd clear the way for an early morning doctor's appointment. Instead, I had to talk the nurse out of calling 911 on my behalf, saying that my wife was already in the shower and that I was certain she'd have no trouble taking me. After all, I'd take her if the tables were turned.
 
Instead, it was made abundantly clear that I'd be taking myself. Not only that, it was made clear (without being put into words) that I was overreacting, wasting our time and money by going to the hospital. In essence, that I was being a big baby. It was only after her boss TOLD her to leave that she came to the hospital. By that time, I was already there... having driven when I was dizzier than most of the St. Paddies celebrants on the road tonight.
 
When we left the hospital a few hours later, I had prescriptions to fill and needed to get some G2 and other liquids per Doctor's instructions. This I had to do completely on my own because, while a ride home was offered, it was once again very clear that I was wasting her time. I'll be honest. I didn't have the energy to fight about it. On top of that, she and the girls spent TWO HOURS going to McDonalds after work... and when she got home I was informed that I needed to take Kairi to the doctor tomorrow on an unrelated issue. Because, after all, I'm not working on Friday.
 
This whole thing has just left me filled with a profound sense of anger... and of insight. Were the tables turned (and there are times that they have been), I went to the store to pick up the meds. I offered to stay home. I checked in on her regularly to make sure everything is ok. Most certainly I did NOT make her feel like she was taking an unwarranted vacation from her ""duties""- the exact way I've been made to feel.
 
This is nothing new, either. Ultimately far too much of what should be joint responsibilities land on my plate alone. I've said things from time to time internally to try and address it... and her response reminds me of Jeff Foxworthy's quote about men and housework... ""Your wife will be out re-paving the driveway and you'll lean out to tell her 'Don't worry about those ashtrays honey, I already done got em!'"".
 
Maybe this is just a product of the various medicines I'm taking... maybe I shouldn't be taking this argument public now... but what it keeps coming back to in my mind is her whole attitude that my being in the hospital- by instruction of a medical professional- left her ""Annoyed"". Just look at her status message. And there's only so long I'm going to sit here and be ""Annoyed"" myself before I do something about it.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_g6evp,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g6evp/should_i_be_angry_with_her_after_all_i_was_in_the/,
1360357868.0,97,self.relationship_advice,185juv,Bf decides to go to Cancun with his buddies during our anniversary/ my birthday weekend. Am I overreacting?,lefroyobunny,120,23,251,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/185juv/bf_decides_to_go_to_cancun_with_his_buddies/,"My boyfriend of ~4 years told me yesterday that he has decided to go to Cancun during Memorials Day weekend (still a long time away, I know) with 10 of his buddies. We have been in a long distance relationship for half a year now (him on the west coast and me on the east coast). We don't get to see each other very often because of the long distance. He is working now and I am still going to school. 

It just happens that my birthday also falls on Memorials Day this year and our anniversary is just 3 day afterwards. I want to clarify that he has made the decision to go, even bought tickets, without first mentioning to me or asking me if I have any plans for that weekend. When he finally told me, it was a simple ""I have decided to go with them to Cancun on Memorials Day weekend."" At first I assumed that I would be going too, but after asking him, he actually said ""i enjoy spending time with that group of ppl, i dont think its too much to expect to do something with them without you.""  

In the beginning of our relationship, I will admit that I had some problems with clingy-ness because this is my first (and only) relationship. Overtime (and especially since we're going long distance now) I have become a lot better about that, and I have matured a lot as a girlfriend. So when I asked him why he didn't bother mentioning it to me he told me ""you always have trouble with me being away from you and going places."" While that was true 2 years ago, I believe that I've proven through the time we've been long distance, that in fact I can handle myself quite well.  

Currently, I am extremely upset by three things:  1) He plans things without ever mentioning it to me if he thinks it will upset me. 2) I am afraid that he is trying to take advantage of me by using the tactic of ""yes now, deal with consequences (aka: me) later"" and 3) He puts his friends before our relationship (this has happend a couple of times before).  When I got mad at him and accused him of not caring, he said that in fact he does care. He said he thought it would be fine since his friends picked a random weekend and plans to get back to the west coast  by 1pm (PST)--4pm my time--and is willing to skype me on my birthday. And he says we can Skype on our anniversary too. Conversely, I'd rather that instead of planning to go with his friends that weekend, he come visit me in the east coast to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday. It's rare that he gets a day off from work, and it was perfect timing that my birthday falls on his day off this year.

So people of Reddit, am I overreacting if I think that it's time for a break for us? I love him and I believe that he loves me too. But there are obviously some issues regarding priorities that I'm not down with at this point. What would you do?

**EDIT: {semi-update}** I just talked to one of his friends (who is also a friend to me) who is also going. I asked him to get some details about how all this went down. He told me it's been in planning for over 2 weeks (during which time I was physically with my bf, and he didn't mention a thing), and that it was kind of badly planned since most of the decisions were made within the last 5 days before buying the ticket. When I asked him specifically what my bf said in their email thread, he told me that my bf really wanted to go to this get together because he didn't get to go the last two years (both times it was during spring break and he was with me on a cruise). 
By adding this information, i'm not trying to defend my bf (although this friend of his is obviously trying to). I'm just trying to provide the whole picture. With this new info, am I being too controlling to expect him to want to spend time with me on our anniversary and my birthday?

It was good to talk about things in a more technical sense, rather than just focusing on all the emotions. Especially after only 1 hour of sleep last night. Anyway, his basic advice was to discuss everything with my wife. As I mentioned in a comment below, I found more evidence on my wife's phone this morning. Basically, it was confirmation that she had in fact met up with the co-worker from the text messages and had sex with him. And then the emails that I read...she is in fact meeting multiple partners and told at least one of them that she has had affairs in the past (and mentioned them by year). Beyond this, there's not really much left to do but figure out how to divide our time with the kids and our shared property. Oh, and confront her about the cheating, of course. I plan to do that this weekend. Thanks again for reading this and for your help. I hope this can help someone else as well, preferably before things get this out of control. I'll keep you posted.

I'll be sure to update you all again; as much as you've helped me get through today, I want to help the next person who comes along and needs some help. Thanks again, I'm off to try and sleep.

Deep breath...okay. Throwaway account here. I have been married to my wife for 8.5 years now and we've definitely had our ups and downs. There were times I thought she may be cheating on me but I never had enough evidence to prove it. Then, things would get better, I'd take her word that she's always been faithful, etc.

Lately we've had one of those down times. We have to kids (2 and 4) and are in a financial mess at the moment (credit card debt, daycare, mortgage and so on) that's been affecting both of us. We're both unhappy with our financial situation and it's definitely sabotaging our love life. My wife has been dealing with it by going out with her friends. A lot. Like, twice a week or more. She also said she doesn't want to have sex because she's so depressed. Once again, I was concerned she may be cheating on me but had no evidence. Sunday night I looked her in the eye and asked her, ""Are you cheating on me?"" Her reply, looking me in the eye, was ""no, that's not even an issue."" I left it at that but wasn't convinced. I have noticed a few texts from random guys that I considered she may be sleeping with, but her phone has a password on it. One time, last week, it was unlocked long enough for me to see a text from a guy that she was trying to hook up with her friend that mentioned something about meeting up at the bar she was going to with some of her co-workers. She told me who would be attending that night and didn't mention his name or her friend that he was supposedly interested in. Still not enough evidence, but I tucked that into the back of my mind.

Then, on Saturday night, she went with her dad to his annual company party. I know for a fact that she was there, as were a number of her relatives that work for the same company. After the party she slept at her uncle's house for a few hours (again, verifiable) and came home early in the morning. After she got home and had slept for a bit, she asked me to get her cell phone for her. I unplugged it from the charger and saw there was a text from that morning from a name I vaguely recognized. I didn't mention it but put a lot of thought into who it might be. Then I remembered it was the name of the guy she lost her virginity to 17 years ago, and realized that she had probably texted him while reminiscing about the first time they had sex, which happened to be in that same bed at her uncle's house. It was then I decided I needed to figure out her phone password.

Last night she went to the gym after work and said she did a spin class and weights afterward. I didn't think too much of it because she has been working out pretty hard lately; she likes to stay fit anyway but it's now obvious why she's working out extra hard. This morning I saw her phone laying on the dining room table and thought I'd give it a shot, since there were now two conversations I felt needed to be read. After a few tries I figured out her password and went to her messages. Nothing from either guy, as she had deleted all those conversations. There was, however, a conversation with a co-worker of hers. That conversation sent my head spinning, hands shaking, and made my knees bend with weakness. While I was pretty sure I was being played, I now had proof. The conversation (paraphrased) was pretty much ""I haven't had great sex in a long time...I'll come over after spin class"", him saying his live-in girlfriend wouldn't be home until 9, and him giving her his address and instructions for the keypad. Because of the last bit, I'm not sure they've slept together before but it doesn't matter. Even if they haven't I know this isn't the first time she's cheated on me.

So, now what? I have legal coverage through my work and I have called (but not yet spoken to) an attorney. I can't leave the house because, although this relationship going to shit really sucks, I will not leave my kids. They are the most important victims of this whole thing and I don't want to lose custody of them. Seriously, I'm not planning to use them as bait, I just really won't give them up. If anyone leaves, it should be her. Of course, this is complicated by the fact that her sibling lives with us, but I don't really feel like adding to many more identifiable details to this post. Sorry this post is long (and possibly nothing new) but I have a lot on my mind and don't really know what I should do. Should I confront her tonight? Please help!

Need advice.,Morning_Glorious,116,17,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/17a61v/updated_28f_my_boyfriend_36m_has_completely/,"**Original Text:**Other than being crushed right now, I'm just in shock. We've known each other for about a year and have officially been in a relationship for 8 months. We had a great weekend together and had plans to go out on Monday night. We talked through text throughout the day and he that he would plan to pick me up at around 7:00 PM. He always texts me when he leaves the office but by 7:00 I still hadn't heard from him so I called. He told me that he was having trouble with an ex girl friend and wouldn't make it for dinner. He's mentioned this girl before and I know she has some mental health issues so of course I was concerned she was reaching out to him again. She has had drug problems and two suicide attempts. But I told him that I understand, that I love him and that I will 100% support him trying to help this girl. He said he loved me and he'll see me soon. And that was the last that I heard from him.

After a full day of not hearing from him I was concerned for his safety more than anything. Car accident, crazy girl doing something, all the possibilities ran through my head. I felt like I was going out of my mind...but when I called his office, they said he was there but was busy. He hasn't called or text me since that last conversation Monday.

So I don't even know what to do or what to think. He has obviously made a choice not to call me back or return messages. I'm not completely naive but I can't imagine how someone could do this. If he doesn't want to be with me anymore or would rather be with his ex, why would't he just tell me? It hurts so much worse not knowing than it would for him to call and just tell me what's going on.

**UPDATE:** For anyone interested. So after being talked into it by a few glasses of wine, I sent him an e-mail just saying that he can talk to me without worrying about being judged because that's what partners do. They love each other through the good times and the bad. I said I respect that he is going through a difficult time right now and while I don't understand why he's ignoring me, I'm not going to continue to try to get in touch with him. It's draining to me and it only makes me feel even worse every time he doesn't answer or write me back. I said that after 8 months I feel like a deserve some kind of response from him, even if he just needs to end it. I said a few other specific things about our relationship and things we've been through together and just ended it with I love you and please just let me know one way or the other.

About an hour later he sends me an e-mail that just says ""I love you. Thank you for everything."" So yeah, I'd say that about wraps up the mystery of if he wants to break up. It comes off as being cowardly to me but what can I do? Not a whole heck of a lot. I do wish I knew exactly what took place on Monday that so completely changed our relationship but I might not ever get that closure. I'm sure it will eat at me for awhile but this too shall pass, right?

I am in my late 20s, he is in his 40s. Obviously we have a considerable age difference but that has never been a big factor. We've been together for about 6 years now. I lost about 15 pounds within 6 months of us starting to date, then over the time of about 3 years gained it back plus another 10-15 pounds. I put most of it on over the 8 months that I had a very stressful job which required me to work about 14 hours a day. That might not be an excuse, however he decided to propose to me immediately after that job ended in order to keep us together and keep me from taking a job that was about 900 miles away. 

Flash forward to 3 years later. He won't marry me because I am overweight. I have been around the same weight, give or take 5 pounds, since he decided to give me a $1500 ring and ask me to marry him. He says if I lose the 20-30 pounds, we'll get married. Unfortunately it's not as easy as it seems. I usually lose about 10 pounds and stall, then fall back into my old patterns. He doesn't like to bring it up, but I'm losing my patience. To him this is an ""easy fix"", but to me my feelings are seriously hurt and I feel like he's playing games with my emotions and my life. Obviously he finds me attractive enough to be in a relationship with me and have sex with me, and there's no doubt that other guys find me attractive.

Around 2009 is when I started noticing very a very unusual vibe from both my father and aunt. At every family gathering,  I can feel the tension between them. The flirtatious looks and desperate attempts to touch each other has grown more more unbearable for me. The way my father talks to my mom is ridiculous and it affects the way I view my mother and my father. I cannot stand being near him while he is judging my mom for not being my aunt. I have mixed feelings about my mom, seeing her flaws while trying to justify why my father is betraying her and at the same time looking up to her and admiring how strong she is. I dont understand why I'm still able to have a normal relationship with my aunt. She considers me her best friend and I see her as a very close sister. I'm in a rut. I spend nights crying and beating myself up for not ending my mom's suffering, letting my father know how much I despise him for ruining my family and his marriage of 19 DAMN YEARS.

A lot of your advice (and I did read and ponder every word) swirled in the back of my head constantly, but I was initially having a tough time accepting my situation for what you all said it was. That this wasn't healthy, that she was crazy, that I was a wuss for taking it, that we had no chance -- I hated the pessimistic reality of it all and I wanted it to be wrong. I wanted to keep faith in us. After two more nights of coming home to her doing the same thing again (and me trying to gently get her to stop with several ""hey""s, waving my hand in front of her face, and even whistling to no avail), I finally faced how much I was lying to myself about the true severity of the communication rift between us and how much we lacked the ability to connect on a level that the most basic relationship should have. And I went to sleep in a separate room (I couldn't handle ""lying"" any longer by sleeping in the same bed as her as if nothing was happening) feeling physically sick. 

The third night is when I finally got her attention. I didn't yell at her, I didn't bring her family/friends home with me, I didn't edit the videos to surprise her with my face, I didn't join in with her. I just stood next to her and started reading her a letter which I had taken the time to prepare off and on throughout my work day. Her usually angered expression looked like it actually started to turn sad (maybe even regretful?) as I told her I loved her, and cared for her, and wanted nothing more than for us to work. I even included a poem that her and I had made together about our relationship during better times. She never stopped moving her hands and staring forward as I read, but I did notice tears start to come from her eyes and I started to get teary too. When my letter concluded, I asked her if she wanted to finally stop and she responded by screaming and turning up the volume of the porn, so I took that as her needing time to herself and left.

The next night, I was pleasantly surprised to find her not at the computer, but instead back to her normal hobbies. She still would not acknowledge that she had done anything at all, but this was a huge improvement that I can only imagine getting better as time goes on. Reddit, I think this problem was solved and I could not have done it without you. Thank you so much for your advice and willingness to help to the fullest.

I love my wife very much and although I don't want to, I think I have to get a divorce. 

My wife and I have been together for a long time.  I am 34 and she is 32.  We have been married for about 7 years, but we met in high school and have been together for 17 years.  We do love each other.  I am an awesome husband and father to two beautiful kids.   I own a software company and we do fairly well financially, we have a nice house, nice cars.  She is the only person I have had sex with and our sex life is very good.  I have also always been there for her emotionally.  All in all, our lives are pretty good.  

For her she was a stay at home mom.  One of our kids is in 1st grade and the other is in their second year of preschool.   I know she was bored staying at home and although I have made several attempts to remedy this, I figured out early that this wasn’t fixable by me, she had figure out this for herself, and I think she did, but in an unfortunate way. 

A few weeks ago, by accident, I found out my wife was texting an out of state number in very large volumes.  For example, in a single month there were over 800 texts back and forth.  I also noticed that there were many photo exchanges between the two.  I only had specific phone number details for the past 90 days, but it looks like this was going on for a while.  

I confronted her about this and after several days of her flat out lying, she finally admitted that she was sexting a guy she knew from one of her guilds.  She said they have been texting for about 7 months and were friends at first, but started sexting for the last three months.  About two weeks before I found out about this she had told him she didn’t want to sext anymore but they could still talk as friends.  After she told me the truth she decided to stay the night at a friend’s house.  It took a few hours for the gravity of this situation to sink in, but I literally got sick over this, I even threw up. 

We are now about three weeks later.  I officially separated from her and I moved into an extra room in the basement.  Over the past few weeks I think I did the right thing. I tried to stay calm and think things through logically.  I decided to setup a time at night after the kids went to sleep to talk through everything.  I asked her every question I could think of.  At first she was still lying about things, but I eventually I got truthful answers, I 'think'. 

I have been somewhat obsessed over this.  I have made calendars of the days they texted, I have charts to track text volume and data volume.  I have a log of all the questions I have asked as well as her answers.  I even keep a little journal of what I am thinking and feeling.   

After asking lots of questions and over several discussions, the reason she said she did this is because of herself image.  She was bored at home.  She didn't feel pretty anymore and this was someone who wanted her.  She knew he would say nice things about her photos  and this was exciting for her.  She said the relationship wasn't all about sex, they talked about other things as well.  

Now, my dilemma is that I keep going back and forth between divorce or not.  I still do love her.  I do think we can get past this.  I can stop being angry at her, but I don't know that I will be able to forgive her.  My children are very important to me, I don't think I can only see them every other weekend. I know we have the option of split custody, but I really don't want to do this to them.  She knows she royally screwed up and she has also expressed a significant amount of remorse.  She said she absolutely doesn't want a divorce and she has said she still loves me.  

However, I feel that the right thing to do is to get a divorce.  This was always clear between us that if she ever cheated on me it would be an instant divorce, this was unquestionable.  She knew what this would do to me emotionally and what it meant for our marriage and she choose to do this.  This also wasn't a onetime thing, sending photos happened about 8 times and there were many photos sent.  I also don't trust her anymore, I feel like she is sugar coating things and I am not getting the whole story.  I am also very concerned that she may have done something in the past that she is not telling me about.  Lots of things are going through my head. 

Basically the logical part of my brain is saying I have to get a divorce.  Many of my emotions are also saying this.  Sometimes I am absolutely certain I want a divorce.  However, other times, especially when I think about the kids, I want to work things out.  I feel completely bi-polar right now. 

A few days ago I told her that yes we are going to get a divorce, and yes I am leaning toward this route.   She requested that I give things more time and wait until after the holidays before I do anything.  I told her I can give it more time, but I don't know how much more time. 

Also, as a side note, I am meeting with a lawyer next week to start the divorce process.  This is not to actually get a divorce, I need a case number so my lawyer can get a backup of the texts from our cell carrier.  I am hoping once I have the texts I can get the complete picture.  

So, the dilemma.  I still love her and I feel we can work though this, if we do work through this maybe we can continue with our pretty good lives.  But I feel like I ‘should’ be getting a divorce and many parts of me want a divorce, but a divorce is going to make the kids suffer and all of our lives are going to go into complete chaos.   This is a very tough decision.  


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your advice.  I may have mentioned that my wife and I try to talk every night.  We talked tonight as well, much of which was due to some of your suggestions.  I also told her about this post.  She is reading it right now.  

EDIT (2012-11-04 @ 1:00 PM ET).  Again, thank you everyone for your comments, I did find them helpful.  I am still going back and forth between divorce or not.  This morning I remembered a few months ago a conversation we had and at that time I almost caught her.  I told her about geolocation embedded in cell photos and I saw a hint of panic.  Later, I had asked if she was sending someone naked pictures and she said no.  Then a little later that day I mentioned that I would hate to divorce her if she was doing that, but that was more of a passing comment.  But for her this should have been a very sobering moment that she was about to destroy everything.  Instead of stopping, she still continued doing this.

GUYS YOU ARE AWESOME AND I LOVE YOU.

Okay, so it took me a little longer to tell her than I would have liked, but I finally did it.  I am **shocked** that she feels the same way.  She hasn't been skipping classes, but she's been sleeping too much and not studying for an exam she needs to take and she's been putting off publishing a scientific paper for no reason.  

If you read in my past posts, I really thought that she was immune to all of this, but she feels the same way.  It's insanity.  She started talking about how she was feeling (girls are much better at that) and it was exactly what I've been going through.  Like, exactly.  

I can't believe we were both going through this alone.

So, we're starting tomorrow morning, June 1st.  We'll be getting up at 6am to go running.  She feels that she sleeps to much and I feel like I'm not getting enough exercise.  We'll go to the park because she's a much faster runner than I, so we'll still be in the same place but won't have to run at the same pace.

I'm going to start redditing less. I'm afraid I'm a bit of an internet-addict.  I will start reading.  :)  Any recommendations, reddit??

We're going to make lists of things we want to do in our free time and then force ourselves out of the house to do them, instead of messing around online or watching tv. 

I'M STOKED.

Any other ideas?

Basically, we both know we're not living up to our potentials.  We're going through mild depression and anxiety.  We're unmotivated.  It's like we have all this energy but all we can do is run into the same wall over and over again.  It's like there's this huge membrane in front of us that we just need to break through.

Me too...


Thanks RA for all the past advice, here's an update to my situation and an additional question. AMA.


We're just begun marriage counselling and in her first comment to the therapist my wife shared that she hasn't felt any sexual desire for me in the past 7 or 8 years (her words exactly). It broke my heart to read this as we were married 4 years ago and now have 3 children. (Do you know how much fucking is required to get 3 children?) It makes me very sad to think that she faked all that passion.


For me this means that she married me without desiring me sexually and makes me feel that I am being used to support her desires to have children/habitation/bon bons/etc...


I have not yet shared my feelings on this with her, our next appointment is early next week and I will be sharing how I feel about this then. Knowing that she felt this way **way** before our marriage makes me feel that things are beyond repair and all I have to look forward to in my marriage is a friend whom helps me raise children.


Regardless; I am committed to doing anything to repairing our relationship and am currently doing the one man cleaning army/scrub sponge things as well as spending all my free time with the children to give her a break. Know how she feels makes me think that these things are useless. I am more depressed than ever.

1285949792.0,93,self.relationship_advice,dljv7,"""Don't make someone a priority in your life when you're only an option in theirs."" Sort of a follow-up.",psychosid,118,25,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dljv7/dont_make_someone_a_priority_in_your_life_when/,"Late 20s, male, US, very small town

I read this quote somewhere when I was in the midst of struggling with a relationship. I had been seeing a girl that I found myself becoming strongly attracted to, beyond the physical sense, and thinking I wanted to date her. Trouble was, she made it clear that she wanted no sort of relationship, and at the same time was very aware that I strongly wanted a relationship. We did all the things bf/gf's do, including physical intimacy, texting each other all day, talking, hanging out, meeting one anothers family and friends, etc. A couple times I pressed her to make it official, but she constantly resisted.

I posted here for advice, and got some good stuff. Then I read this quote, which I though succinctly summed up the gist of the advice I got on reddit.

But it wasn't easy to try to put this into practice. Being such a small town, I didn't have the option of just ""finding someone else."" There are only a handful of single girls in my small town, and most of them are outside of my dating pool. So we still did the same things together.

Finally, last weekend, I met another girl who took an interest in me. I contacted her this week, and she took the initiative and asked me out! 

That's what it took... suddenly it all made sense. I had been pining for a girl who only wanted me around when it was convenient for her. She was aware of my desire to make it something more, and not only did she say no, but she toyed with me for months by keeping me around -- leading me on, so to speak, even though her stance on relationships was always in the back of my mind.

But finally, on this other date, I realized this is what it's all about. You can chase the things you can't have, but it will never work. The idea is to find someone who wants to be in your company just as much as you want to be in theirs. That's how it's supposed to be!

**tl;dr** - Tried to make something happen with a girl who made it clear she wasn't in for it. Took a date with another nice girl to make me realize I needed to get out of the thing with girl 1.

""Don't make someone a priority in your life when you're only an option in theirs."" Words to live by.

**I post this not to ask for advice, really, but just for folks who may find themselves in a similar situation. Hopefully it helps someone else. I'm happy to answer any questions and participate in a discussion!**

**Edit1:** I should have elaborated on the ""leading on"" part. It's true that she was always up front that she did not want a relationship ""at this time."" But she often said things along the lines of ""some day"" and ""when I'm ready for a relationship"" and led me to believe that if I hang around long enough, I would get the prize. That's what I meant by leading on -- dangling the carrot in front of me.

**Edit2:** One thing I wanted to add. This whole situation taught me that I view human relationships in a completely different way than girl number 1 in this story. To me, when you find someone who you like, enjoy their company, are physically attracted to, and find some beginnings of what could be a lasting relationship, you jump at the chance! Those things don't come along every day, especially in a small town when you don't have the opportunity to meet dozens of new people every day! I don't care what's going on in my life, if I meet a girl like this, I'm going to make every effort to see it through and see what happens. To me, ""I don't want to be in a relationship right now"" is a terrible set of handcuffs to put yourself in. What happens if Mr./Mrs. Right walks into your life during this time period? You're going to let it slip by because the last bf/gf did you wrong?!",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_dljv7,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dljv7/dont_make_someone_a_priority_in_your_life_when/,

At one point a guy in the group points to me and says to her ""That's the creepy guy"" (in a non-joking manner)...  I guess he didn't think I'd hear because I was drunk, or he didn't care because he was drunk.  

I've always been kind of an outsider in this group.  I met them in college, but I've always wondered why I wouldn't get invited as often or I would get some strange vibes from them at times. I've literally spent years trying to prove myself to these friends but for some reason they seem to think I am shady.  I have no idea why since I've never done anything to warrant it, I try to be open and friendly to everybody I meet at all times, and I virtually never speak ill others. I have a suspicion that perhaps somebody spread rumors about me in college and that image has kind of stuck with me since.  I feel like maybe one person didn't like me at point, and that person talked to others and soon enough I was known as 'that guy'.  To give you an idea, many of my friends are Asian.  In asian communities, once you have a 'reputation' or sorts, it's hard to get rid of.  I have a policy never to speak ill of people behind their backs, so in a social setting I would definitely be more vulnerable than the average person.

I am ashamed to admit it,  but it hurts tremendously when people I consider my friends have seen me as a 'creepy guy' this entire time, and perhaps keep me around out of pity.  Should I even bother continuing to stay friends with them?  At this age it is very difficult to make new friends, and I'm not sure if it would even be worth it as I'm now a grown ass man anyway, and almost reaching that age where friends are kind of unneeded any way.

Has anybody else experienced something like this? Would like to hear from people close to my age or at least in college.

With that said, this past weekend, she was being lazy watching TV doing her own thing, so I started on a project that I wanted to get to, but have procrastinated on.  Fifteen minutes later, she says that she wants sexy time.  

I reply, well, I just started my project (which requires getting out the correct tools, setting up a workspace, etc...).  She said, well, can't it wait?  I said, alright, why don't you take a shower and I'll be up in fifteen.  She replied, I'm not taking a shower, why?  I replied, well, what if I want to go down on you?  Her horror stricken, WHY? DO I SMELL?...Me, no, that's not what I meant, blah, blah.  Her, extremely pissed, forget it.  She hasn't talked to me really since then (a few days).

I have apologized many times and told her that I absolutely do not think that she smells, to which she constantly says, then why did you say, because you might go down on me?  I really have no answer to this.  The truth is, I love going down on her, but she doesn't ever shower or wash before sex.  We had drunken sex the night before after partying all night and I know that I had dried stuff all over me when I took a shower that morning.  Truthfully, it would be nice if she was just slightly considerate, but now she is super pissed and I'm feeling like I did something horrible.  Any help?  Am I wrong?

Granted, I'm old (35, M), but I *do* remember a time not too long ago when Facebook and cell phones weren't ubiquitous.  When people moved, they tended to lose touch and / or sever a lot of their social connections, simply because they knew it wasn't possible to maintain them.

I'm not saying they did this intentionally, but people were realistic about the long-term possibilities of a long-distance relationship, and were also more inclined to want to seek out new social connections in their new environments.

Now, it seems to me (I know, I know - ""get off my lawn""), a lot of people neglect opportunities for social interaction, dating, etc., because they're fixated maintaining tight contact with people they already know who are nowhere near them anymore.

Case in point: the girl I posted about in another thread has a LDR (3 years) with a guy 6 hours away.  His job is not going to allow much flexibility in the way of where he lives, and hers (if she achieves what she hopes) is several years off, and will be similarly restrictive.

What kind of potential is there in a relationship where neither person has much say over where they end up (him less than her), and they're so far apart that they see each other only once or twice a month, at best?  And in an arrangement that will have to last for years - she's a long way from finishing, and he's not changing careers.

In the years before Facebook and texting, I suspect cold, hard reality would be much quicker to set in.  But now, these kinds of relationships (and I'm not criticizing hers, it's just an example) lumber on well past their expiration date, with people unwilling or unable to move on.

I dunno, am I just being curmudgeonly and ranty?  Or is there something in this?


**EDIT:** To add content for continued presence in ""relationship advice"": How do you get around this with respect to going out and meeting / talking to people?  I feel so much lately as though *everyone* out there is involved with somebody else.  I'm not a guy who really tries to horn in on peoples' relationships, and people are often not very receptive to social encounters when they're ""dating"" someone long-distance.

Do you guys just proceed as though everyone is single until proven otherwise?

And a corollary to that is: how do you go to a place like a bar of coffee shop and initiate conversations with people who seem, by all indications, to be more interested in talking (via text) with someone who is not there?

So today I was planning to go round my girlfriends house and stop over as I usually do, when I get a text saying ""Bollocks"" I ask why and it turns out she had previous plans to go out with this guy who I might add texts her 24/7. I've told her in the past that he likes her and she agreed, so I just said be careful that he doesn't try anything. 

So tonight at around 11 I get a really wishy washy text about how she loves me and how sorry she is and that this friend of her kissed her when she went to go hug him outside. Now she said that the kiss lasted no longer than one second and she pushed him away and told him to go. Thats fine by me she obviously didn't want it and it's not her fault. 

This is where the plot thickens. At around 3am I get a message on tumblr from his GF (who I've never spoke to before) asking me what's going on. So I tell her that her scum bag boyfriend decided to try and kiss my GF. She gets upset by this and asks her boyfriend she gets a different story to me. Where they were sitting in a field just talking about how much relationships suck and then they just happen to kiss. 

So me partly angry at the thought I've been lied to rings my GF to ask her about it, she says it's all bullshit and that he is lying and that it wasn't really a kiss and that he's apologised to her. So I'm really confused at this point and demand to see the apology that she got from him and the texts afterwards and this is where I got really mad. 

Him - Sorry :/ xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Her - You should be haha ahhh man what do I do? xxxxxxxxxxx
Him - Well I'm not going to lie that was kinda wow xxxxxxx
Her - **** We're both in relationships :( xxxxxxxxxxxx
Him - I know :/ I didn't necessarily mean now xxxxxxx
Her - I don't know what to say :( xxxxxxxxxxx

So 1. how the hell is a one second kiss ""wow"" 2. How am I supposed to be ok with her response? 

So I kinda got mad and told her what did she think she was doing by replying like that ""I didn't know what to say, I was in so much shock!"" ""And he kissed me!"" ""It was hardly anything!"" Plus lots of I loves yous and so. 

So reddit I've decided that I want a break as I'm going to Cornwall for two weeks, what is your opinion? Would really like some advice as it's killing me. 


Update - As of now I have split up with her. The complete lack of remorse and wanting to have one last meeting with him and laugh and act like nothing happened has pushed me over the edge. I will not be treated like that. Anyway on the up and up. Cheers for the advice guys it helped to see that I wasn't being an idiot or overacting that this was toxic and I needed to get out. Hopefully I wont be seeing you guys any time soon. Thanks again.

I am crushed.  Backstory- We've been best friends for 6 years.  The first three we both had several other relationships, some long term.  We have now been together ROMANTICALLY for 3 years as of October.  I don't want to get into irrelevant details but to get this part out of the way; We have sex every day or every other day and it is always intimate and satisfying to us both, we usually orgasm at the same time or close to it.  We are obviously incredibly compatible and we really do fit together like two puzzle pieces. 

Another thing that is important in this situation is that we have founded and grown a very successful business over the past 3 years. (at least on my scale of life in general) We are in real estate and we have made a conservative 6 figures for the past 2 years.  We are in our mid twenties. We work from home and we spend every waking minute/second together and as far as I knew had quite an ideal relationship.  We are nerdy, anti-social, introverted, intelligent, entrepreneurs, lovers, best friends – we have the same views on religion, politics, marriage, etc etc..

Earlier this afternoon, I found a log of texts in his google voice - this is what they say:
11:15pm - Her: Do you still want me to come?! I'm coming from San Diego &amp;&amp; I want to leave now 
12:11am - Him: How are you doing? Her: I'm on tha freeway now I'm just drivin slow Kus it's raining  Him: Totally cool. see you soon.
1:05am - Her: I got lost, but I'm 10 minutes away.  I hope you didn't change your mind sweetie. Him: Not at all gorgeous. 

These were the first few messages in his google voice text ""trash"" folder and they are from Feb 18th.  

I researched the number and very little research concluded that this number is definitely an ""escort"" in our area.  A Latina one waiting for YOU!!!! And promising not to “waist” your time &amp;&amp; stuff &amp;&amp; yearning for you” Really? Waist? God.

Ironically, he flew out yesterday for business and was coming back home tomorrow afternoon.  I should not have (maybe?) but I called him when it first hit me and I put the pieces together.  I must say I've never felt something so powerful come over my body.  My hands went completely numb and then went into this clenched fist and I literally had no control of opening my hand for several minutes. It was very very strange, but I assume just the shock.

I did not give him any specifics because I realized the phone call was a mistake, but I did give him the date and he knew I was quite upset about that date.  I explained that this is not the way, place, or time to have this conversation and remained calm but he knew. He did not own it, he did play dumb on the phone.  Without me asking or mentioning, he immediately packed up everything and got on the next flight home. (He was in our business partners' office and I had first hand witness of how quickly this was done) He is supposed to be home in the next 3.5/4 hours. 

The more I think about how to handle this the more confused and scared I’m becoming.  What are my beloved reddit’s thoughts?  What would you do?

One thing I’ve got left to do is check our bank account for those few days. Ugh

Hi, RA! Love this community, hoping you guys can give me some advice on a situation that is really upsetting me.

My boyfriend (22M) and I (20F) have been dating for a little over a year and a half. We met on a dating site and the relationship just took off. We pretty much agree that we're as close to ""soulmates"" as two people can get. Our relationship is very close and we hardly ever fight (until now,) though neither of us are the most affectionate, lovey-dovey people. I've said I loved him maybe two or three times thus far, and him even less, but the situations it was said in and the scarcity of it being said makes it all the more meaningful to me. He has quite a few mental/emotional issues, and I'm a pretty level-headed, sane gal. We're best friends, partners in crime, and usually our sex life is pretty good too. 

We've had a couple of problems before, all due to his emotional issues, and even ""broke up"" for a short period of time, maybe a little less than a month. He left the country for three weeks and we broke up the week before, but practically nothing about our behavior as a couple changed in that week before he left. We were spending just as much time together, having just as much sex, doing just as many couple things. After he left I decided I had best get over him because we were done for good, we had just spent the last week before he left together for ""old time's sake"" and to end on good terms. 

He tried to contact me a few times while he was overseas, and I responded scarcely and was lukewarm when I did respond. Finally we had a long angry conversation over IM one night where basically he was complaining about his life and wallowing in self-pity and being an entitled asshole, and I told him so. Two days after that he was e-mailing me saying he was sorry, he missed me so much, he had some conversations with the people he was staying with that made him realize that I was right about everything and I was perfect for him and he loved me and he wanted to be back with me and move in with me and all this other stuff. He was more open and affectionate than he ever had been before. I was really happy...... I had been pretty sad since we had broken up and I didn't really think he wanted a future with me. I was worried that he was just homesick and sad and was saying things he didn't really mean, but we talked out that concern. This was about a month ago... he came home just before the end of June.

Things have been awesome since he came back. He's been so sweet and affectionate. He even said ""I love you,"" once, unprovoked, which he had never done before. We were just spooning in bed and he said it. I teared up a little, I will admit.

About two weeks ago I got a message on some old obscure social networking site that I don't even use anymore from someone saying she needed to tell me something and asking if I knew a guy named (boyfriend's name.) I said yes, I do, I'm his girlfriend. She then proceeded to tell me that she had been talking to him for about a week, exchanging dirty pictures and sexting and stuff, and that he said he was single. She said he gave her his phone number and invited him over. (it's worth mentioning that she went WAY, WAY out of her way to find me on this obscure website and contact me.) I'm a pretty non-confrontational person but I was PISSED, so angry and upset I was shaking. I sent him a pretty stern text demanding that he explain himself. He owned up to it right away, never tried to deny it. He came over later that night to talk about it and my god, when he walked up to my front door he just had the saddest and most pathetic look on his face. I'm too empathetic of a person, I know this. Basically his reasoning for what he did was that he felt jealous of all the attention I get from guys (I do, but I don't fucking engage with these guys) and that since I'm really the only friend he has and the only person he sees or talks to on a regular basis (also true) it makes him feel lonely and he doesn't really know how to make friends so he feels like sexual attraction is the only way he can connect with other people. He said he never intended to meet her and was just manipulating her for sexy pictures and attention.

 Okay, doesn't excuse anything, but I somewhat understand where he's coming from. I needed time to think. I didn't know what to do. I was pissed, hurt, upset, humiliated, and in general felt like absolute shit. My gut, and most of my friends, said dump his ass right now but I was hesitant because jesus, I love this guy, and I'm not the most assertive person in the first place, and just blehhhhhhh general wishy-washy behavior on my part. We behaved like a normal couple for the following week but he knew he wasn't in the clear. I asked him what I could do, besides breaking up with him, to properly communicate how COMPLETELY NOT OKAY it was to do what he did, and he said he didn't know.

Fast forward to last Friday (weird sentence.) I receive ANOTHER message from this girl with a copy-pasta'ed message that he sent her basically saying that he was sorry, and he really had feelings for her, and that he and I were practically already broken up, and that he ""absolutely swears he wasn't just using her for naked pictures and sex "" (SEX? what's this now?) and that he ""just didn't want to miss his chance to get to know her because it was the first time in his life something felt like destiny"" and blah blah blahhhhhhh and in general saying all this weird desperate shit that didn't sound like him at all. 

WHAT THE FUCK!?R2EGBQ13UQWEJSD I flipped out. I was so mad. I couldn't believe him. I sent him quite a few angry, curse-filled texts. I had never been that angry or that upset in my life before. This fucking dumbass!!! Did he really think she wouldn't tell me about this when she went so far out of her way to tell me about the sexy pictures in the first place? What in the fucking shit ass hell was he thinking?! Get caught lying by girlfriend once, be all sad and apologetic and say ""I don't want to do it again, I want to be better,"" ............. BETTER DO IT AGAIN, only this time even WORSE! He was blatantly, shamelessly lying to both of us and honestly I was waaaaaaaay more hurt by the things he said in the second message than I was by the fact that he was exchanging dirty pictures and sexting.

We talked about it. A lot. He agreed that it was absolutely fucking retarded and said that he wasn't really thinking when he sent the second message. He didn't really have any excuse or reasoning for that shit.

But during our conversation something came out, something that he'd mentioned in passing before but never really talked about. Apparently he wants to have sex with other people. Apparently he is bored of having sex with the same old little boring me for a year and a half, even though I have a higher sex drive and I am the more sexually adventurous one and he absolutely refuses to do anything adventurous in bed. He's a pretty sexually boring person. He won't give or receive oral, and he will only do missionary or me on top. Nothing else. At all. Ever. I don't mind because I'm pretty easy to please, sex isn't hugely important to me in a relationship as long as we're having it and we're both enjoying it. And he never even indicated before this that he wasn't enjoying sex with me :(

My gut reaction to this is to feel horribly sexually inadequate. What is wrong with me? What's so repulsive about me that makes him want to have sex with other people? He keeps saying there's nothing wrong with me, that it's not my fault, that it's not that I'm not GOOD enough. He just wants to experience ""different"" things sexually. I guess I understand that.... though there's no way for me to get away from feeling sexually inadequate now.

But I'm not okay with him having sex with other girls while he's with me, and I told him so. I said hey friend, you are welcome to go have sex with all the girls you want. But if you do, I am going to break up with you and probably not speak to you or see you for a little while so I can get over all this shit. You can't stay in a relationship with me AND have sex with other girls because I am not okay with you having sex with other girls. His reaction to this is that it's HORRIBLY unfair and why does he have to choose and why can't I just be okay with him having sex with other girls. I told him ""basically you just want to have your cake and eat it too. You can't do that,"" and he said ""why not?""

On Sunday I told him I was going to break up with him and he had better come over so we could talk about it in person. We talked about all the things I just mentioned for quite a while, and then he got really super sad and looked like he was crying and clung to me and said he didn't want me to break up with him. I just don't understand this guy. He's had so many chances to leave me if he wanted to, if he was unhappy. He goes behind my back and lies to me and essentially cheats on me (in my mind, it's cheating,) and when I offer him the get out of jail free card of me breaking up with him, he STILL desperately tries to hold on. He wants to have two mutually exclusive things at the same time and thinks it's unfair that he can't. 

SO. I know I should dump his ass, delete from gym, hit the facebook, etc. I know that's what you all are going to tell me to do and that's probably what I'm going to do eventually because at this point there's no way I can trust him again ever, he doesn't deserve another chance, every time I think of what he said to that other girl I feel sick. I guess maybe I just need a kick in the ass from you guys and/or advice on how to do it since..... when I tried he started crying and bear-hugged me. It's hard to be angry at someone you love when they're doing that, no matter how angry you were before. OR, alternatively/in addition to breaking up with him, how on earth can I make him understand that he can't freaking be in a relationship with me and have sex with other people BECAUSE I'm not okay with it, and that that's not unfair, that's just how life fucking is?

Thanks a lot if you read this far, and I know my actual question is pretty vague. I guess I mostly just needed to get this off my chest and some outside perspective on the situation from people who aren't involved. I appreciate any comments you guys have to add.

**TL;DR because that was long as shit: boyfriend of a year and a half says he wants to have sex with other people, but doesn't want to break up with me and gets emotional when I try to break up with him, even though he went behind my back and essentially cheated on me.**

**edit: thanks everyone. My phone is actually broken right now which is good because I'm sure he'll be sending me lots of angry texts/calls after I send him this e-mail I'm writing right now and block him on Facebook. Thanks for the kick in the ass.**

Long story short, I have a very messed up family, and my grandmother was the one who took proper care of me. She died 2 years ago, but I was too scared to go to her funeral.

Last weekend, I went out drinking with my girlfriend, and we started talking about more emotional subjects, such as death.

Turns out my girlfriend has yet to experience someone close to her dying, whereas I have found my dad dead when I was 12, some suicides in my family, etc.

Our conversation got me thinking though, and I really want to go and visit my grandmothers grave now, as I honestly feel ashamed for not going to her funeral, and cutting down a lot on the contact I had with her, when I moved out.

Would it be weird/too soon to ask my girlfriend if she is willing to come with me?

Wow where to start.......So i just turned 22 years old, senior male in a big university in a very promising major and need some help because things suck. As the title said I have never had a girlfriend, kissed a girl, which then means i have never had sex. I have held a girls hand before, hugged one and I regularly find girls attractive. I haven't ever really had any friends that I regularly talk to except maybe in middle school. I have been told by a few girls on a dating website (That i asked this question) that I am good looking when i showed them my facebook account. This year we went to a club at the beginning of the semester and I danced with some random girl that I found attractive for at least an hour. Then she leaves the dance floor without me, i see 5 minutes later she is with another guy..... oh well. I'm 6'4"", but slim, i am only 195 pounds. I don't enjoy talking to people at the bars because I am never good at approaching someone and just starting a conversation out of thin air. I am only in 1 club and I am in a school that is 60% guys and 40% girls. Not in a fraternity, and this is a very greek school. I am finding it very hard to meet a girl. I have plenty of friends that are guys, but of the friends they have that are girls, they either think we are lame or my friends are always going after the girls that are their friends. My grammar sucks by the way, sorry. I would say i have very little confidence. I am not good at small talk at all, and I often am thought of as an asshole by girls when they first meet me. Or when they meet me they just don't talk to me all together for some reason (least it seems that way). I get uncomfortable easily in certain situations. Basically I don't have any friends that are girls, and all my friends who have friends that are girls have like.........1. I don't know what to do, looking for advice. Be as critical as you like.

edit:Oh and, when i am not in class, or trying to be social at bars/the club, i like video games obviously. I am an mmorpg player.........i know.....

edit2:This is kind of my last resort before i just give up on relationships all together......

Please keep posting advice for me, i am reading it ALL and trying to respond to it all. I have learned so far that yes, i am going out and doing things. Maybe not as much as i could but i can change that. I am also learning that if i keep doing what i am doing that it will happen eventually. Seems like it will all keep getting better and that there might just be some bumps in the road. Again thanks to everyone so far, you guys/girls have been awesome.

I am not trying to ignore anyone with my lack of replies-- I am just thinking about what has been said.

**TL;DR: I am a 24-year-old woman so ugly I get ignored by a lot of people, especially men.  I am clean, average weight, and I try to be nice.  Is there a way I can get people to interact with me?**

Basically I think I may be too ugly to easily make friends, nevermind have sex with someone.  There's nothing seriously wrong, i.e. I never split my face open, don't have bad acne, don't have any physical deformities.  But I look in the mirror and my face is just so plain and different from everyone else's.  I was teased for being ugly since high school and I don't know anyone else who was teased just based on what they looked like.  I thought maybe it was just these few people in high school, but then it happened in college too.  I was at a sophomore dormitory seminar once on body image (lol) and the RA talking at the front of the group said something like, ""Not everyone is born a model.."" and the girl sitting next to me nudged her friend and pointed at me, then they both laughed.  I guess they forgot I have peripheral vision.

In high school I was fat as well, which obviously didn't help.  Sometimes people mistook me for a guy back then.  In college I got my weight under control and I exercised all the time, because I thought maybe my ugliness would be less troublesome if I was thinner than most girls.  Currently I'm 24 years old, 5'7"" and about 140lbs.  I was wrong about the thinness thing.  It didn't help.  In fact probably the worst part was that my shoulders (which are kind of broad to begin with) got a little more muscular, and my boobs shrunk..though I don't have flat/nonexistent boobs either.  I have always kept myself clean and I wear my hair long in a ""feminine"" cut.  I try to dress neatly and not in anything weird.  Sometimes I wear fingernail polish because I hope someone notices that I'm putting out the effort.

In high school I had plenty of friends.  In fact I'd go so far as to say I was the leader in my little pack of buddies.  I got along well even with people who were not my friends, but the people who teased me were always good-looking boys.  I had a close male friend, but I can't say he was really my boyfriend because we never got to kissing or dates more exciting than sitting next to each other at a movie.  He was really sweet but I don't think either one of us understood what to do.

But the second I left for the weekend freshmen orientation I knew I was in trouble.  I couldn't find someone who wanted to be my roommate.  I couldn't find anyone who wanted to hang out with me.  Most of the time I felt like I was invisible, but when I did speak to people they would give me a strange look.  I got paired up with another fat girl eventually for my freshman roommate and I hoped we could get along...but she barely talked to me.  The entire semester I was unable to get anyone to talk with me for any length of time, and no one approached me about anything.  This was a small school, about 1500 undergrads.  My roommate left school over winter break-- she had never told me or the RA.  I got a couple of friends in my sophomore year, but one of them dropped out and then I dropped out at the end of my junior year.

I went back to college at a larger school the following semester.  I finally found someone who actually sought me out in one class and wanted to talk with me, but unfortunately I found her in the last semester of my senior year.  There was also a boy who talked to me and seemed to really enjoy walking around campus with me, but I think it was only because we both shared a common interest that's fairly rare among college students (plays by Christopher Marlowe).

So I finished my undergrad degree and lost touch with those two immediately afterward.  Now I am a grad student and I'm doing well enough in that.  I participate in a few extracurricular activities hoping to meet new people.  But at best I have a few acquaintances from my work and my research.  No one has ever invited me to a party.  Last semester a couple people actually invited me to get Chinese food after a day at the lab, but when we got there (driving in separate cars) they suddenly said they weren't hungry and left.  I know that it's really pathetic to look at a single situation like that, but it was literally the first social encounter I'd had in years.  

I can't help but think my appearance is the causal factor here.  I have always tried to be cordial to people, and people always laugh at my jokes, etc etc (well sometimes it may only be a supportive laugh).  I try not to look too desperate, i.e. I don't stare or talk *too* much.  I don't have problems being among large groups of people, or speaking to them (I would have a lot of trouble with grad school if that was true!).  My grades are fine, I still exercise so I feel physically okay.  I don't think my few acquaintances are aware I have no friends.

But I think the way I look just frightens people away, or that I've somehow lost the ability to connect.  Men especially don't pay any attention to me, or only do so to make fun of me.  I've gotten more than a few ""Hey John there's your girlfriend!""-type insults when walking across campus.  I can't afford plastic surgery and I'm not sure I would want to do it anyway...so if anyone has tips for what I can do to make people look past my appearance it would be appreciated.

If no one can think of anything I haven't thought of already that's okay too.  It does feel nice just to type this out...which is probably why it's so long.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_ak2cc,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ak2cc/too_ugly_for_any_kind_of_relationship/,

[NSFW],throwaway39482012,138,44,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1geibr/literally_the_worst_date_ever_how_can_i_21f_make/,"Well here’s my story;
I just got out of a three year relationship. It was awful, he was rude and constantly cut me down. He was my first love, and I was stupidly attached to him. (We had been dating since high school)  About two weeks ago I cut it off with him. 
Fast forward to last weekend. My friends had been begging me to go out with them every night, and finally I was just lonely enough to do it. At the very first bar we sit down to, a really cute bartender starts to hit on me. This is my first time doing this… “dance” EVER. I was very nervous, and my friends kept urging me to give him my number. After a few hours of flirting, I decided to leave him my number on a napkin.
We went on one date, and it was incredible! Out to eat, went to a bar, walked around downtown. Had a great time, we were brutally honest with each other about everything going on in our lives and honestly tried to help each other. At this point he tells me that he is known for being an asshole. (MY FIRST RED FLAG, WHODU THUNK IT) At the end of the night we slept together, and then I went home.


I thought I had just experienced my first one-night-stand, which I was okay with strangely. 
But then he kept texting me and saying how much he wanted to go on another date with me, and he was going to be watching the hockey game later (I fucking love hockey and my cable is out) so I agreed to meet him at his place where he claimed he and a few buddies were going to be grilling out. 


Here’s where it gets awful. 


As soon as I get there, I see it’s just me, the guy and ONE of his friends. Not a party, not a few buddies, three people. But that will play in later. 
His ex calls him after I’ve been there for about 20 mins, and he proceeds to stay on the phone with her for a good 30 minutes. The entire time coming up to me, kissing me, grabbing at my legs. At this point I’m getting pissed off, but I don’t know any better and I stay around. 
After he hangs up the buddy decides he wants to go to the pool. I don’t have a swimsuit, so I’ll just stick my feet in. It’s also around this point I realize how DRUNK he is, because as soon as we got into the pool area he literally picks me up and throws me in- shoes, cell phone, cigarettes and all. 
I get out of the water pissed as hell, so I walk back to his place to change out of my clothes and put my phone in rice. He gives me some of his clothes to wear, which are fucking huge, but I was too drunk to drive at the moment so we started to watch the hockey game.
Well, the entire time the game is on, he keeps… um.. pulling “it” out. (Seinfeld, anyone?) Trying to get me to touch it, trying to get me to look at it, ect. IN FRONT OF HIS FRIEND. 
I got super offended and left to go to the bathroom. Mind you, I’m wearing his clothes still and they are huge on me. He follows me to the bathroom, and keeps pulling the huge shorts down (I’m little and they were hardly staying up with the drawstrings all the way tied) much to my protesting. He also keeps pulling “it” out and trying to fuck me. 


I get super flustered and use the excuse “your friend is still here.” 
So the only logical thing is to INVITE HIS FRIEND IN to try and convince me to have a three-some. TOTALLY. 
His friend feels awkward and eventually just fucking leaves because he’s tired of seeing the guy’s dick. On the way out he tells his friend that “he needs to stop and clearly she’s not into it.” 
When I finally realize that the other guy is gone, I started frantically looking around the apartment for him, hoping he was just hiding and he didn’t seriously leave me alone, but it’s not like it was his job or anything. 
So when I’m peaking in a guest bedroom looking for the friend, my date pushes me on the bed and rips my shorts off again. With my back turned, I hear the “CLICK” and see the flash. 
This mother fucker took a picture of me. 
I left then in a rage, far too late to save face, and drove home (drunk). 



All the next day the dude was texting me, saying how much of an ass he was and how terrible he felt. It’s been three days and he wants me to go out with him again. 



Here’s where I need your help. I think I want to agree to go on one more date, but only to get that picture back. Ideally I would like to go to a restaurant or somewhere public, but he’s not willing to go anywhere other than the bar where he works and his apartment now. One friend advised me to just ""let them go"" but, Reddit, hell no. 

Help me, Reddit. This is my FIRST dating experience outside of highschool and I feel like a fucking idiot. That picture (What if there's more??) MUST BE DESTROYED. What is the appropriate thing to do now???

TL;DR went on two dates, first was great second one was SHIT and he got a naked picture of me. How do I get it back??




UPDATE:: Went to the bar with a friend, he seemed surprised. I told him upfront what I wanted and he gave me his phone and let me delete the pictures myself. I also looked through his text messages to see if he had sent it to anyone. He said he felt awful and gave my friend and I a beer. I told him I wouldn't press charges so long as he didn't try to contact me and that my relationship with the bar wouldn't be changed (small town, not a lot of pubs) and he agreed. Thank you everyone for your advice, it really helped a lot. 
I understand that I may have been reckless, but I am trying to take this as a life lesson and learn from it. Hell, everyone has had a bad date, and mine just turned out to be AWFUL. Lesson learned, now to move on with life.

So we are completely through and she pretty much hates me. I don't think there was much I really could have done to change it. Here's what happened:

We had talked about what we could do and none of the options looked too appealing. While I was in Toronto, she told me that she would be willing to commute on weekends and try that out since I had been doing it for almost 2 years. This didn't look like the greatest option but I was willing to try it because I loved her and wanted to make it work. She also said that as soon as she was finished her degree she would try living in Toronto.

So, we left it at that. I told her that I needed to come grab a lot of my stuff because I need them in Toronto (like my computer, clothes, etc.). So I made plans with my friend to drive down on a Friday, snowboard on Saturday and then come back to Toronto. She said we could stay at the apartment.

We arrive at 8pm on Friday and something is obviously wrong. I go for a walk with her and we talked about it. She told me that she was extremely angry at me for doing this all during the holiday season and so close to her birthday. She said she doesn't know if she can ever trust me again that I wouldn't just run off on her. I said that I can understand where she was coming from and asked what she wanted to do. She said that she now doesn't want to commute, and that she wants to try try living in Montreal for at least one more year. I told her that it wouldn't be at least one more year because she's in university for the next 4 years (minimum). She didn't really even acknowledge this. She just said that after one year I'd be happy there and I wasn't even really trying before. She said that I'd never really tried living in Montreal since I was commuting all the time and I've never had a full time job there yet. I tried explaining to here that I *know* I'm not happy in Montreal and having a full time job there will probably only make it worse (for reasons I went over in last post). I also brought up the fact of kids. *If* I stayed I said that we'd want kids within 4 years so what would we do then? Well, this brought out what I believe to be her true plans and colors. She immediately said that she would *never* raise children in Ontario. She said that we have no culture and how could she ever raise a child in the english language. She said ""what would happen when they are 15? They would one day look at me and say Mom, just speak english to us. We don't like speaking French"". She was absolutely unwilling to even compromise. I would've put them in French schools and taken regular vacations to Quebec (even would've bought a cottage there!). But no, she was 100% unwilling to consider this. *So*, basically her compromise was that there was no compromise. She was never willing to even consider moving to Toronto or Ontario. She hates this province and English. It was so apparent. I found is extremely offensive when she said that we have no culture. I never knew how ingrained Quebecois and Separatism were in her.

So, after all this we went back into the apartment where my friend was waiting. We agreed that we needed some time to think about all this and no decisions could be made at 11pm (it took a while). She then decided that she was going to go to the bar with her friend. She left at 11:30pm. As soon as she walked out the door, something in me clicked. I just realized that this girl was *never* going to compromise with me or respect the way I felt. She was always going to discount my feelings and that she will always have our life planned out with little input if any from me.

So, I told my friend that we needed to **go**. Luckily I had some boxes lying around. In the next hour we packed up almost everything I owned in that apartment and moved it to his car. I only left the TV and the couches that I had bought (100% my own money). I booked a hotel room and we stayed there the night. She called me 50 times in the middle of the night as well as my friends. I told her everything that I just typed here. First she said that it was only the beginning of talking and that maybe she would have changed her mind, but eventually she just started swearing at me and calling me horrible things and saying that she hated me.

I'm sad. I wish we could've ended it better and I told her this. I told her I still loved her and she'll always have a place in my heart. It's just sad that we will never be able to live in the same place. I'm not happy as a person in Montreal, and she would never even consider living in Toronto. It's not because we hated each other, it was just one major disagreement on where in the world we wanted to spend the rest of our lives. 

I feel I made the right decision by taking all my things that night. Previously she had taken my keys and threatened to kick me out and that she would ship all my things back to me and her convenience. I couldn't have let that happen. This was my only chance. She said I ran away like a coward and a thief but I was *not* going to trust her with basically every possession I have (a lot are irreplaceable), especially when she is so angry. It was then or never.

Anyways, that's the update. I doubt there will be another one. She'll probably never talk to me again. I'm back in Toronto surrounded by all my amazing friends. Everyone has been so ridiculously supportive that I can't even describe it. Most families aren't even this amazing. I'm truly happy here. It's a feeling I haven't felt in a longggg time.

Race has never been a concern among both our families. However, several days ago we decided to grab lunch at a local restaurant.  

Note: I am a very petite girl (5""2 and small) that can come off as very timid. SUPER harmless. 

The moment I entered the restaurant, a group of boys sitting in the corner were loudly spewing out racist remarks while staring at me. This continued from the moment I arrived until they left (still tossing one racist comment after another directly at me). Never met these people in my life, and I did or said nothing to provoke such behaviour. 

Not only did my SO say he never noticed the boys, he began to grow frustrated at the fact that I expected him to stand up for me. He lectured me, justifying that there was nothing he could have done, and it was unfair for me to expect him to say anything on my behalf. 

Is it wrong for me to ask him to say something in the future. Simply a ""can you guys please stop,"" or ""that's offensive"" would have made me feel better. Or even if he squeezed my hand and comforted me when I got his attention to tell him I felt uncomfortable while the incident was occurring. 

Is it irrational for me to want the man in my life to be supportive and somewhat protective of me? As traditional as it sounds, sometimes feeling safe with the person you love is nice. I froze in shock, and needed help.

We had plans for today (this morning actually) that we talked about for a while. We were both excited and looking forward to it.

She called me at about 12:30. She needed a ride because she didn't want to stay at a friend's house. I was asleep, but fine, I'll pick her up. When I get to her, she's *wasted*. Reeks of alcohol. Slurring her words. Stumbling around. Everything. I take her back home and get her some water and try to put her to bed. But she has no idea where she is. I have to tell her a couple times that we're in *her* apartment and it's *her* bed. When she's finally settled in, I go back home.

Just gave her a call a few minutes ago. She's hungover and sounds like death on the phone, and we've kind of missed our early start for the stuff we had planned today. And I don't know if I'm mad or disappointed or what. This isn't the first time this has happened. And I'm getting tired of it. She should be able to go out to a bar and control herself. But I guess that's kind of besides the point. The thing I'm mad about is the fact that she threw our plans out the window. She knew we were getting up early. She knew I was excited for it. And to go out and get blackout drunk and ruin those plans just seems like a slap in the face. 

I 100% plan on talking to her about it. But I'm not sure what stance to take. Is it my place to say that she needs to stop doing that? Besides the ruined plans, I was actually worried about her. She was by herself waiting for me to pick her up, which isn't safe. And it was kind of scary to see her so incoherent back at the apartment. But we've only been dating a few months, so I'm not sure if I'm qualified to make those sorts of demands. Maybe I need to take the route of saying that she can do what she wants, but I don't think I can stick around if it continues like this?

There was plenty of nudity and marital/relationship issues brought up in the movie. The second movie was ""Friends with Benefits"". During the intermission the argument began. The girlfriend began telling me that every movie I pick out has nudity and it makes her uncomfortable. I felt like I was being blamed for making the movie. 

She wont choose what we watch so I choose movies I think will be funny and geared the to the mid 20's crowd. She referenced every recent comedy with a nude woman in it and blamed me for picking them. She made it seem like I have a problem and always intentionally pick movies with nude woman in it.

I don't know if I can ask for advice...but I don't know if there is nudity in movies. Im seriously considering watching every movie prior to letting her see them like shes an 11 year old.

It isn't just movies though either. She hates the idea of porn (which I don't watch) and if i say the word bachelor party she freaks out. She thinks I cant live without a strip club in my life. I don't even like strip clubs! I went ot a bachelor party a month ago and waited outside while everyone else went into the club. I felt like a douche but she appreciated it. Believe me, I dont want to go in the strip club but I sure don't like being told I cant.

Why does she get mad at me though

I just want to watch funny new movies that the rest of society thinks are hilarious

We left during intermission because I was afraid that the ""friends with benefits"" movie would have nudity. I don't know if it does....but I know I sure would have gotten in trouble if it did. I wish I coulda stayed. I know i did the right thing by leaving but i like Mila Kunis.

EDIT:added strip club part

EDIT 2: Ive been at work all day so I haven't been able to keep up with all of you. Ill do my best when I get home to start responding. Someone mentioned I am trolling but I assure you i'm not. I made a couple fun sarcastic comments because its fun and people on reddit like to laugh....Ill probably leave some more when I get home. Anyway I hope this topic entertained a bunch of you loyal redditors....that's what it was ultimately meant to do...allow me to vent and laugh a little at our everyday problems

EDIT 3: Seems there is an overwhelming response saying its her insecurities and problems with nudity. I kinda wished there was going to be a group of redditors that said ""Oh I have the same problem"" with my girlfriend but it appears my frustrations are unrelatable to the general population. I do appreciate the words, and the name calling, as it is deserving. I don't know where this will end up but hopefully your awakening of my eyes will start the changing I desperately need in this relationship.

About two weeks ago I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dxk0r/no_sex_for_over_a_year/) thread, and just wanted to give you a quick update.

First, I talked to the gf.  I held her hand, made it clear to her how much she meant to me and how my priority was to make sure that that two of us were happy.  I then said I don't want her to apologize for anything, because she's gone through something terrible and I don't blame her for it.  I kept pressing the fact that all I wanted to do was make the two of us happier.  I then explained, delicately, how difficult it was to communicate with her, and how much I missed talking and having sex.  She responded by bursting into tears and saying she was fully aware of how she was treating me, but I had been so patient that it never occurred to her that she needed to change her behavior.  (Basically I was being an enabler by allowing her to treat me this way, and it put the idea in her subconscious that her actions were okay.)  She realized that the entire year had been spent taking care of herself, and admitted she had recently somewhat enjoyed and took advantage of the excuse, so now needed to start repairing her relationships.  I was so relieved;  this was not at all the reaction I had expected.  I hugged her and kissed her and told her how much I loved her.  I felt the happiest and saddest I had felt for a long time.

I then met with her private therapist and discussed alternative treatments for PTSD, but the gf made it clear how happy she was with her current treatment, and our initial discussion was enough of a wake-up call.  We agreed that if couple's therapy wasn't sufficient, then she would try the other treatments.  Of course I realize there might be some ways in which she won't be exactly the same, but she is so strong and so motivated and cares about ""us"" so much, that I'm willing to put in the effort to make this work.

It's only a couple weeks later, we had two sessions with the couple's therapist, and already things are MUCH better.  Whenever I confront her about something, she is now much better about taking a deep breath and thinking about what to say;  sometimes she still lashes out, but always catches herself, apologizes ONE time, and initiates a rational reaction.  I'm also starting to speak up for myself more, since she is in a position to listen better.  She's starting to seem more and more like her old self, she's repairing other friendships that had been damaged because of the assault, and, best of all, *we had sex last night!*  I can't even begin to explain how happy I am about this.  We spent just two weeks gradually working up to actual sex.  I think the main issue for her is foreplay; she seemed uncomfortable at first, but what helped her get past it was when either of us said my name out loud, to emphasize the fact that she was with ME, and she was safe.  We have other specific exercises too, and once we get past the initiation and actually start doin' our thing she gets really into it and enjoys it and we share words of love.

Thank you endlessly for your advice reddit, I'm so happy with our progress.  If things keep up like this for another year, I'm going to propose.  Wish me luck!",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_e4p6p,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e4p6p/update_on_gf_with_ptsd/,

But first a little introduction:

About 2 weeks ago, a new colleague started working at the same place my girlfriend works. She's been working there for about a year and she always had co-workers coming and going, talking to me about them, how she gets along with some and not so well with others, the usual ""how-was-your-day"" talk. I've never been the jealous type and always offered her complete freedom and never questioned her trust, even though her co-workers are mostly guys. We actually mock the boyfriends who are overprotective of their girlfriends and don't allow them to do something or get upset even if she would be talking to some other guy. 

Well, fast forward to 2 weeks ago, she gets this new colleague and as usual she starts telling me about him. How smart he is, how well they get along, what great talks they have etc and I am genuinely happy for her that she finally has someone to talk to and make the day easier on her. So, I make nothing of it, and things go great while she keeps telling me how great that guy is. To be honest, I got a little jealous (who wouldn't?) but I didn't let it show and I was angry on myself for feeling jealous, afteral, there's nothing going on between them and I shouldn't feel this way. 

Then 2 days ago, I call her at work, as I usually do, to chit-chat in her break, and she tells me that she just came back from a walk in the park with a girl-colleague of her, I say ""cool"" and she says ""oh, and also the new guy came with us"". I got a little suspicious here, not because he went along with them, but because she mentioned him coming with them at the last moment, somehow like she ""forgot"" that he was even there. But I tell myself that it's the jealous guy talking inside me and I'm just over analyzing it. 

So, yesterday, I go to pick her up from work, as I always do, but I forget my phone to call her when to come out. I swear, and I know it might not be believable, but I actually forgot my phone. 

So, since I can't call her to come out, I go inside to pick her up and there she is, sitting in this guy's lap with her arms around his neck and his hands around her. If I didn't know any better I would say they are definitely together. She jumps up from the chair and from his lap and with this scared look on her face and shaky voice tells me ""why didn't you call?"". I tell her I forgot my phone and that I'll be waiting outside. 

At this point my heart is racing and I'm furious, I feel betrayed and I consider that she stepped out of line. I don't know if for some this type of thing is acceptable in a relationship, but that doesn't even matter. I just try to picture myself with a girl on my lap, her arms crossed around my neck, and ask myself if I would do that, if I would consider it out of line, and the answer comes easily to me: No, I would never hold another girl like that while I have a girlfriend. 

So, she comes out, we go home, and I calmly explain to her that what she did was out of line and that I feel betrayed and that we should take a break.

So, my question is, did I overreact, did I over analyze the whole thing, am I in the wrong, is it just the jealousy in me talking?

I'm 28m, she's 22f.  We've been going out for over a year and a half and living together for six months.  There is really only one thing that frustrates me about our relationship, and I feel like it's probably the worst thing to be fed up by in a relationship.

It's the frequency with which she says ""I Love You"".  Ever since we first said it, she has been like a toddler whose learned a new phrase.  Every. Two. Minutes. (perhaps an exaggeration...) She looks at me, with a sappy voice says ""I Love You Random"".

If I tell her it's getting to be a bit much, she storms off on the verge of crying like I hate her.

This morning, by the time she left for work, I had been up for 30 minutes and she had told me she loved me 6 times, in between her being in a different room getting ready and I eating breakfast. I giggled as I responded to her and mentioned this when she was leaving for work and she ran off silently and sourly.

I really feel like sometimes I just want to respond screaming ""I GET IT. YOU FUCKING LOVE ME, I FUCKING LOVE YOU, SHUT THE FUCK UP"".  Really, it's getting so obnoxious and under my skin that I can't stand it.  

Am I a bad person for hating how often she tells me she loves me?  Or is this REALLY obnoxious? She says it ALL THE TIME.  It's practically all the ever says to me.  I can accurately predict when she will say it to me by the tone in her voice leading up to it and the fact that it's been more than 30 seconds since she last said it.  

This, and the ""I Missed You's"" are really getting under my skin.  On her lunch break, I get texts, and every day after I come home from work (12 hours since we've seen each other, at most), I get a flurry of ""I missed you, did you miss me?"".  No, I honestly didn't miss you.  We've been apart for half a day, and on a daily basis you act like you hadn't seen me in months.  

Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that this is the worst problem in our relationship, but it's just soooooo unnerving.  We are talking about getting more serious and, while I couldn't leave her over this, I also can't see myself spending the rest of my life being told the same thing over and over and over again.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1364384428.0,,,True,t3_1b3ri5,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1b3ri5/too_much_i_love_you/,

My wife and I have been married for just over a year now. We've been together for almost 5 years. We have a child together, and own a house.

**The Story:**

She went to visit her family out of state over New Years. I wasn't able to go due to other obligations, so stayed home. She went to a party for New Years with some old friends of hers. It turns out that at the party, she ""fell in love"" with someone else. She slept with him, then decided she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him (how someone makes this decision over the matter of a day or two, I don't know). She decided she was going to get a divorce, and move back with him. 

She was acting weird when she got home and I knew something was up, so I confronted her and she admitted all of this. She told me that she wanted the divorce and wanted to leave. After talking for a little while, she agreed to go to marriage counseling with me and to give it another few months before making the decision. Basically, she agreed to give it a serious try to work things out before making any decisions that will affect the rest of our lives. 

I know some of you are going to think that I should just let her go and all (and in some ways, I agree) but when we got married, I took it to heart that it was a life-long commitment. I also do not want to have a fight over interstate custody for our child with her, nor do I want to sell our house to split our assets. I know that chances are, she would get custody, and I am the primary income for our family, so I don't think she could give our kid a good life. There are a lot of other reasons that I want it to work, but the main one is that I really do love my family and don't want to see it ripped apart.

**The Problem:**

So, back to the story. It seems like we're going to give it some time, go to counseling, and give it a real try, so maybe everything will work out. Well, I found out that she's still texting the guy nonstop. I told her that she shouldn't talk to him like she is if she really wants to work things out. Her response was ""We're friends, so I still want to talk to him."" My thoughts are that she slept with this guy, so if she wants to work it out with me, she needs to choose between our relationship or their friendship. Is that a bad request? Is it wrong of me to make this request, or is it just me being ""controlling"" (her words)?

I love her, but this, to me, is out of line if she's serious about working it out. If it wasn't for my kid, I would probably just cut her loose at this point and watch her fall. She makes $10 an hour at her job, has had 7 or 8 different jobs in the last 3 years, and has no real skills other than being outgoing. The guy is in the same situation, except with even fewer skills. I, on the other hand, make close to 6 figures and am in line to take a higher position in my company in the very near future. Our kid changes everything though. 

TL;DR My wife and I are going to try to work things out after she cheated. Is it wrong that I ask that she end her friendship with the guy she cheated with, or am I being controlling?


**Edit**
Thanks everyone for the comments. I tried to respond to most of them, but it ended up being a lot of the same things over and over. A couple of things a lot of people brought up:

I had already spoken to a lawyer before this post was made. The lawyer recommended counseling, but also recommended that I cover my ass. All interactions are recorded. I am keeping track of my finances (we have separate bank accounts), and what we each do to take care of our child. I know that the relationship will probably end soon, but with our kid involved, and on the lawyer's advice, we are going to try counseling. Our counseling doesn't start for another week though.

As far as alimony, she gets none. Our state has adultery laws on the books for divorce proceedings, and they are still in use. 

The biggest issue would be custody/child support. The easiest way for me to get primary or full custody is if she left the state (with or without our child). Otherwise, it would be up to me to prove that her having our kid would be bad for the kid. According to the lawyer, it's nearly impossible to do here without someone having a criminal record. Finances don't matter much to the family courts as far as custody rulings here, as child support is meant to cover that. Unfortunately for me, our state is also a big proponent of the Tender Years laws.

Wow! I wasn't really expecting so many answers, thank you all guy for the advice. I took my time and went over all your comments, and after think about the situation for a while I went to talk to her. To what she said that she didn't really meant it in that way, and she will be more careful about using that word. She also told me that the whole thing escalated pretty quickly and me being the first person to get that far, she didn't know how to react. I told her that, I looked at her all the time while we were making out to see if she was ok with it, and that I wouldn't do anything to harm her in anyway. It all ended well, hugs, kisses. And I do agree with CursedBeIron. She didn't wanted to admit that she enjoyed it, to what makes me confused, but I guess I will find out later. As for us, I'm not sure how it will continue, nor how much time will need to pass before we get sexual again. 
To answer some people advice, leaving is not a really good idea, it just makes you look like a douchebag and doesn't really helps. I mean all that will just lead to her saying ""OP abused of me and then he left me"", what I definitely think that is a Gogol times worst!
So, any idea of how to introduce the sex again to her? I don't mean to sound wrong but, the reality is that it is an important thing in any relationship, although I won't really have any problems waiting some time, but I feel like I made a wrong first step into that topic.

Guys thank you all for this great support! You are making this a ton easier with all your advice.
Best wishes.

I'm a 27 years old guy and, two days ago during a routine checkup, a tumoral mass in my liver, probably neoplastic, has been found. That means, according to my physician who examined the results, that best case a difficult operation plus a long time of chemo awaits me, worst (and most likely) case I've got around 6 months to live (that will be determined by further exams, I think MRI).

My girlfriend was with me at the hospital but I managed to hide most of the truth to her (she thinks it's some kind of innocuous lesion on the liver), she pressured me into telling my parents, which I haven't disclosed the full truth to too.

At the moment, I don't know what to do. I won't be able to hide the truth for much longer. Stangely, I'm not a single bit afraid to die: I've always thought that but you can't know until the time comes, now it's come and I can say that I don't fear death. I'm young but my life's been full and I have no regrets. What scares me a lot is the pain involved with the operation and the chemo and, most of all, all the suffering that I will cast onto my family and my girlfriend - she loves me dearly, I do too and I really really don't want her to stay with me in this condition.

I know you will think I'm crazy but this is, more or less, my plan: I'll tell to my girlfriend I don't love her anymore and that I've cheated on her, after that I'll tell my parents I've found a job abroad and I'll leave for some place nice where I'll be able to spend my last days in a hopefully pleasant way and, when I'll be so sick I'll not be functional anymore, I'll kill myself. 

I'm sad at the idea but I want to save my family and my girlfriend all the pain. I can't live with the idea of them seeing me like that and suffering as a consequence. I want them to remember me the way I am now.

I'm asking your opinion here because I'm really conflicted. Please no ""omg your so stupid stay with them they love you"", I know that, I also know from experience that it's much better to lose someone suddenly than it is via a long and painful illness.

I tried to tell her not to pursue him. She naturally didn't appreciate that. Things came to a head, we discussed it, and I later realized I was in the wrong. I've talked with my roommate and we're cool. Now I don't know what to say to the girl. I feel so bad because not only did I ruin my relationship with her, but I probably sabotaged her potential relationship with my roommate. On the one hand, I want to apologize because I don't want to remain a dick in her eyes. On the other hand, given that I already threw away our friendship, I'm not sure if it'll do any good.

We're engaged to be married with a date set and lot's of details already planned.  However, I fucked things up pretty badly a little over a month ago, and can't seem to set them right.

After a long period of having a basic ""routine"" sex life, she finally got some motivation/inspiration to spice things up.  She became more active in the bedroom in pretty much every way you can look at it.  More initiation, new positions, lot's of positive things going on.  However, she also started giving more instruction, and making verbal requests/demands during sex.

At first I was totally cool with it, and didn't want to say anything negative because there was so much positive change going on.  But the verbal requests/demands started to get on my nerves more and more.  Simple things like ""slow down,"" ""move this way,"" and the big one ""I don't want you to come yet.""  I realize in hindsight that her motivation in everything she said was to improve our sex life, but I misinterpreted it in the moment.  

During sex, after a few weeks of this new ""non-routine"" where I have not said anything negative, I respond one of her verbal requests with ""Why don't you just get on top and get yourself off?""  Fucking OOPS.  I totally see in hindsight how I made a mountain out of a molehill, and let myself respond totally inappropriately, but now I can't seem to fix it.

We have talked about this for hours.  I know I hurt her feelings and that what I said was inappropriate in timing and in content.  She knows I know.  She also knows that I'm aware of the fallacy I fell into of letting a minor irritation affect me too much by blowing it out of proportion.

But nothing seems to make it hurt her any less.

I've apologized, bought flowers, listened, talked, then listened.  We haven't had sex in over a month.  Last time we started, she started crying and we had to stop.

How do I fix this?

Edit:  The tone when I said ""Just roll ~~over~~ on top and get yourself off."" was one of disgust, and disinterest in what we were doing.  At the time, she thought we were both enjoying this a lot, and had overcome some of her insecurities to try some of the new things we had been doing.  In her mind, I think she heard the equivalent of ""I'm not enjoying sex with you at all, and would rather be doing something else.""

Hey guys, so I got a few PMs asking me to update so I thought, hey why not, I owe ya'll for the advice. :)

So Link and I have been going steady for about 2 weeks now. Everything has been awesome. I've been having some tough school stuff because of finals, and he really couldn't be more supportive. 

An example would be the other day when I was freaking out about an exam. I was at school early and texted him at like 7am to see if he was awake/could come visit me at my study spot (he lives on campus). He showed up 5mins later in his pajamas and a hoody and we just sat there with his arms around me while I teared up on his hoody and he told me I'd do fine. I did fine! For someone who's never been in a relationship, he's doing a damn good job.

In regards to his best friend girl person, she is still in the picture. She actually broke up with her boyfriend last week and he's been offering a lot of support which I can understand and don't have a problem with because I trust him 100%. The facebook conversation never did come up in real life, but it's obvious to me (at least) she outwardly does not like me. For instance, we all went to the bar the weekend she broke up with her long distance bf and towards the beginning of the night she ""accidently"" spilt her drink all over my dress. She was all giggly and apologetic about it, but the way it happened in my opinion was no accident. No worries though, the night was young so I jumped in my car and grabbed another outfit. 

Other than this, she tends to try and make me look stupid in the large group I'm now a part of (because of Link) with people I don't know super well by calling me out on my opinions and such. She can be really dense so this often backfires, unfortuneately for her. She does other stuff I haven't mentioned, but pretty much it all goes down to me getting to know her, and finding her to be a *MASSIVE ATTENTION WHORE* so I think she's just butthurt about losing a large percentage of that from my now boyfriend. 

I haven't bothered Link with any of her more recent actions since I can totally handle myself and it's really not affecting our relationship. I'm sure she's a good person at heart going through a tough time right now, so I've let a lot of her behaviour towards me slide.

Anywho, I hope you guys enjoyed the update!

[Source](http://www.askmehelpdesk.com/relationships/no-contact-rule-46556.html)

Here is something I have found about the no contact rule. I hope it helps others as much as me. 

So, you’ve had your heart broken, probably begged and tried to convince your ex to get back together with you and failed. Realising that staying in contact is causing you more pain than you can handle, you take the step of implementing this ‘No Contact’ (NC) that we advocate widely on the forum.

So what’s it about then? And what is going to happen?

Hopefully, most of the answers will be in this thread What is No Contact? 

While a seemingly simple question, there are variations of what ‘No Contact’ can mean.

1) You tell your ex that you won’t be contacting them and that they shouldn’t contact you.
2) You don’t tell your ex anything, and just drop off the face of the Earth.
3) You don’t tell your ex anything, you stop contacting them…but still allow them to contact you and you reply. (potentially damaging)

In my opinion, the most effective forms of NC are 1 and 2. They allow you to heal, as the ex isn’t given any way of providing you with hope (bait) or potentially emotionally damaging information (who wants to hear how great their life is without you?)

When starting NC, it is up to you what you want to say to your ex. Most people seem to say something along the lines of “Don’t call me unless you change your mind and want to give us another try”. It might also help to let them know that the window of opportunity to reconcile (from your perspective) will not be open forever.

You also may want to tell the ex why your cutting them out of your life – tell them it is so you can heal and move on. And in reality that IS why you’re doing it……


Why implement No Contact?

First and foremost, you are removing the source of your pain (your ex) from your life. If they aren’t in your life, they cannot hurt you – it’s as simple as that. And while the loss of the ex from your life in itself is painful, the benefits far outweigh the initial emotional turmoil.
No Contact allows you to get back on your feet and start to feel confident in who you are again. Remember a time when you were single and happy? Well No Contact is going to put you on the road to getting back to that point.
Some may be reluctant to take steps to regain independence, but you are useless to anyone (including your ex if they want you back) if you are unable to be happy with yourself.

No Contact can also serve another purpose, and this is the one that (if you are seeking reconciliation) will probably be used by you as inspiration to keep strong in avoiding picking up that phone or sending that email.
And that is of course, to send your ex a wake-up call and perhaps make them second-guess their decision to end the relationship.



Will No Contact bring my ex back?

Perhaps, perhaps not. There is no fool-proof way to get your ex back…if there were, we would all be using it and would all have our exes back.

There has to be some desire to reconcile inside your ex – NC will not create that desire, but it may certainly bring any underlying doubts they have to the surface. That does not mean that your ex will act on these doubts…but you can be certain that NC will at the very least make them realise just what life without you is like.



Will my ex miss me? 

To be honest, it shouldn’t matter – you should be doing NC for YOU. Having said that, it is always easier to stay focussed on maintaining NC if you know that it is having at least some effect on your ex.
So, will they miss you? In most cases (unless you have become a thorn in their side), yes - absolutely.
For those who have exes that want to remain friends: Why do you think that is?
It’s because they want you in their life. Exes very rarely stay friends…so in effect, when an ex asks to stay friends they are essentially saying “I still want you in my life”.
They are not ready to let you go (yet), so by implementing NC you are forcing them to lose you right then and there. NC prevents the ex from using you to cushion the blow of the break-up….by weaning themselves off you slowly. 
Without NC you can be certain that once your ex is back on their feet emotionally (helped there by you), that the ‘friendship’ that seemed so important to them at the time will be non-existent.
No Contact is a far better option than staying friends. Being friends causes you pain and allows your ex to heal quicker. NC causes your ex pain and allows you to heal quicker 

Not exactly rocket science, huh? 

When should I implement No Contact? 

ASAP but you must be certain that you can stay strong and stick to it. NC isn’t a decision that should be reversed until you are completely healed. If you keep implementing NC and then breaking it, it sends a message to your ex that you are needy and haven’t got the strength or the conviction to follow through on your commitments. Using NC without being genuinely committed to it is a recipe for disaster – you will break it and look weak. And you if you try to use NC again, your ex will not be too bothered….because “You said that last time”.

That’s why NC should not be used as a ‘shock tactic’ – don’t expect to implement NC and for your ex to come running back to you in a week or even a month. If you use NC, you have to be in it for the long haul.




Will No Contact push my ex away? 

If there is hope for your relationship, then no it won’t – it will make your ex think about their decision. 
After a few weeks of NC, you’ll probably get worried and start deluding yourself with thoughts like “Maybe they’ve forgotten about me…and maybe they think I don’t still love them”.
If that’s the way you’re thinking, then how about considering this: If you have NC with your ex for a few weeks and then contact them to tell you that you still care…what message does that send?
It says to your ex “I implemented NC to move on and heal…and now 3 weeks down the track I haven’t moved on or healed at all.” 
The ex will again know that they can still have you if they want you…and even if they don’t hear from you for another few weeks, they won’t be overly concerned – the last few weeks hadn’t diminished your feelings, so why would the ex think the next few will? 
Not a bad little (HUGE) security boost for the ex there, huh? Not to mention a huge step backwards for your good self.


How long will I keep hurting? 

For as long as you allow yourself to. Remember, the ex is now out of your life – they cannot hurt you. So if you’re still feeling pain it is coming from within you – not from them. 
It is perfectly normal to miss your ex, and by miss I mean that some days will be almost unbearable. 
Go out, meet with friends (don’t talk about the ex!) or if it’s late at night think about the things you didn’t like about your ex…and even revisit arguments you may have had with them. If you have to think about your ex, think about the negatives.

Thinking about the good times is pointless – there is no possibility of having them back at the moment, and to dwell on what you once had is ultimately self-destructive.

Ideally, you should be doing your best to not think about your ex – do whatever it takes and keep busy. The less you think about them, the less you will hurt. Soon enough, not thinking about them will become normal.


What if the ex breaks NC and calls/emails me?

Two options: Respond or don’t respond.

If you have completely given up hope or don’t wish to reconcile with your ex – ignore the contact and keep ignoring any further attempts at contact. Easy.

If you are seeking reconciliation, then it depends on what the ex says when they contact you.
If they are calling for a ‘catch up’, politely tell your ex that you were serious about NC and that they must respect your decision. This call may come after a few days, a few weeks or a few months. Don’t get into any discussions about yourself and what you’re up to – keep it short, and make it clear to your ex that NC isn’t just a whim….you are serious about it. Remind them, if it comes up, that friendship is not an option.

Make it clear that you are respecting their decision to end the relationship, and now they have to respect your decision to end contact.
If you are seeking reconciliation, you also have every right to question your ex about their intentions if they contact you. Do so at the beginning of the interaction – there’s no point having a great conversation with the ex and getting your hopes up only to find out at the end of the call that nothing has changed. Save yourself the trouble and find out at the start - if their motivation for calling you is anything short of what you are after, terminate the conversation politely…but quickly.


Tips

Remove any photos and reminders you have of your ex from your life. Put them in a box and pack them away. You don’t need things like that preventing you from moving on.

Copy down your ex’s email address and phone numbers on a piece of paper, and put them in the same box. Then delete the email address from your computer and their numbers from your phone.

If you are strong enough to delete their contact details without writing them down, then do it! If not, do the above – it will remove the temptation to contact your ex (especially when you are out having a couple of drinks or at home alone in front of the pc ).

Stop talking about your ex with your friends. They’ll get sick of it, and it won’t help you one bit.

**TL;DR** : Followed some advice from reddit and tried to communicate my problems to my fiancee.  This led to a sexual breakthrough and now I feel more excited about our relationship and our sex life than ever.  

First and foremost I want to thank everyone who tried to help with some advice in my previous post (I also cross posted to /r/deadbedrooms and advice there was useful as well).  A lot of it was hard for me and I may have felt on the defensive, but I can't deny how spot on some of it was.  I hope long updates aren't frowned upon, particularly 24 hours after the original post.  I wanted to share though because the advice from this sub helped a lot. 

Last night, while we were making dinner together we began to fight about the incident that prompted my writing of the previous post, and our sex life in general.  A lot of stuff came out, and I learned a lot of things and was able to convey my point of view more clearly than before.  

It turns out there was a lot going on.  She was mad at me in general.  She was withholding sexual affection because she didn't think I was being affectionate enough.  She was self conscious about her body because she wasn't getting enough positive feedback from me.  She was intentionally taking all my ""effort"" in bed without reciprocation.  She didn't think I wanted her to do more, and thought that merely bringing up the idea of sex was enough for me.  She felt like I was criticizing her by telling her I wanted her to do more, and had interpreted it as if I didn't think she was good enough. 

She had a hard time explaining this all at first.  And I recognized some of the things she was feeling were my fault as well, and some of those things sent us into a downward spiral in the bedroom. 

She apologized to me for all the things which were bothering me and I promised to work on the other things for her sake as well.  We felt pretty close then but she didn't want to do anything that night, which I understood because a big fight after a long difficult day can be rough, and I wasn't sure if I wanted to either.  

Instead I suggested we talk about what we each want sexually - essentially baby steps.  I told her I wouldn't judge her for any fantasy / fetish stuff that she might want to do because I had my own and some of them were pretty crazy.  She explained to me what she wanted to do, and it was a little out there.  I added my own suggestion to it to show her I had some fantasies like that as well and she was really into it. 

Since I mentioned mine and said I had others she begged me to share.  So I shared one more and mentioned the mojoupgrade quiz that's linked over at /r/sex, saying we should do it some day.  I was still a little nervous about sharing too much too quickly, but she was persistent and pushed to take the quiz.  So we did. 

As it turns out, neither of us was as 'vanilla' as the other expected.  Going through our answers together was amazingly liberating.  Almost everything I was into or wanted to try she wanted to try as well.  Perhaps liberating isn't a strong enough word.  This led us to talking frankly about sex maybe for the first time ever after being together for almost 7 years.  And for the first time in my life I didn't feel ashamed of my sexuality.  

And despite her saying she didn't want to earlier, once we got talking about it and I got to explaining and talking about... well, it led to fulfilling one of the fantasies I had for a long long time.  And it was amazing.  Today I feel more excited about our relationship than I did after the first time we slept together.  Yesterday thinking about our relationship I felt trapped, depressed and at times physically ill.  Today I feel kind of like I won the lottery and my hands are shaking in anticipation.

We started out as friends while she was in a LDR with another guy. I managed to break the clutches of the friend-zone and we have been together ever since. She's always had guy friends, some she has known since childhood, others she met more recently through work. All of which are generally good and interesting people that I also enjoy hanging out with. I consider several of them to be extremely close friends of mine. 

A new friend, let's call him John (23/m), suddenly appeared in her life. He works with wife, in a different department but same location, same floor. He works a later shift and generally arrives to work as she's finishing up her day. They spend the first hour of his shift chatting while she finished up her day. He's ""very cool to talk to"" (exact quote). Apparently John has worked there for over a year, however his name has only been mentioned recently.

A few weeks ago several of us went bar hopping, wife invited John to come out with the usual crowd which included some of wife's other co-worker guy/gal friends. This is my first introduction to John. We start talking and I quickly realize we have very little in common, John doesn't seem like the kind of guy that I normally hang out with...no biggie, the night moves on, conversations rotate, people move on with their lives and everyone has fun. John drinks...a lot...quantities of American Light Lager (barf) that will surely loosen the strongest of colons. The group thins as the evening progresses and John, who now needs a babysitter, stops being fun.  He inches his chair closer to wife (who has stepped up to the duty of den mother), touching her arm when he slurs to her.  John sees some other people that he knows and runs off. I and another friend are ready to leave. We convince wife that John, who lives a few blocks away, will be fine. She finds John as we make our escape to say goodbye. As we travel home, wife apologizes and ensures me that John is a good guy and ""is cool as shit to talk to when he's sober"". Good, great, grand. I'm not a fan of drunk John. 


I'm informed throughout the weeks between then and now that she gave John a ""talking to"" about being so drunk. They're friends again. yay. They chat every day after work. awesome.

Friday. Her work has an event after which everyone is going to a bar. I'm sick (stupid fluctuating weather) so instead of infecting the masses with my plague, I sit this one out and ride the Nyquil train to dream land. She'll be there with trusted close friends so no worries. Oh, btw, John was invited to join (event was not for his department). Friends text and FB some pics to me throughout the evening, just the usual (wife is weird poses or caught making an odd face) nothing special (no John).

1:00am - no word from wife (did she get drunk and is staying with one of our friends? is she on her way home?) I check find-a-friend app (which wife and I use when we dont feel like sending ""where are you"" or when she sends the daily ""why haven't you left work yet"" texts). She's not far, about 5 miles away but in an area that isn't exactly on her way home. Is she staying with one of her girl friends whose address I don't know/remember? Is she driving home a drunk friend? I don't want to be ""stalker-y"" (yet the app doesn't help) so I wait a bit.

1:45am - She moves, heading home, Arrives just before 2am. Another dose of meds quickly take hold and I'm back down for the count.

Saturday morning - I'm up before she is and re-thinking the 1am - 2am events. Now, I'm not normally a jealous person...but serious...why did it take her an hour to travel what would take 20 minutes...with heavy traffic.  I'm also annoyed at the lack of communication, ""I'm going to close out the bar"", ""I'm going to stay with {Close Friend}"", ""I'm on my way...if I don't make it send help"", ""Irm two drnk...com gert me"" any of the above would've been nice.

Sleeping Beauty awakens around noon. We exchange pleasantries, I supply coffee and offer advil (non-needed). 

""What time did you leave the bar?""  ""1""  ""Oh, why'd it take you an hour to get home?"" ""It didn't take an hour"" ""Well, you got home at 2"" ""Oh, yea I guess it took an hour then"" {She takes coffee and walks away to check her email...I didn't realize conversation was over}

""So seriously, why'd it take you an hour?"" ""Oh, I drove John home, he was too drunk to drive."" ""And that took an hour?"" ""Well, he didn't want to leave his car there and {blah blah filler}. So he moved it across the street and we left"" ""Yea"" ""And we sat in front of his house and talked for a few minutes""

...

""A few minutes?"" ""Yea, like five minutes"" {walks away again} 


""Ok, honestly, I stalked app'ed you {our name for the app} when I didn't hear from you and saw you nearby right after 1. You didn't move until 1:45am"" ""Oh, yea I guess we talked for a while then. WHAT? do you think I did something? NOTHING HAPPENED! I WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING!""

 
""Ok fine. {I leave to do some shopping}."" She sends a few messages reiterating that she wouldn't do anything, especially anything that would make me not trust her. And she's right, she hasn't but this isn't sitting right with me.

 
After a few hours of thinking by myself, I return home and spill my guts. I tell her that I don't like John, I don't know John, and I find it completely inappropriate that she's ""sitting in the car talking in front of his house for an hour."" If roles were reversed she'd feel the same. She agrees, she'd be pissed to, but wants me to like John. ""What if we all hang out in the future?"" ""I have no interest in hanging out with John"".

We continue through the day in normalcy, I see her texting and iMessaging every so often as she does some work (which is normal). She laughs at a few messages, I'm bored and question, she shakes her head and continues some work. I'm still pissed about the situation and steal a glance at her computer when she steps away...she's chatting with John.

We decide the spend the evening in take-out and an old movie. She spends the evening sporadically messaging with John.

She goes to bed...I'm fuming. I read messages. She tells him all day about how I'm pissed that they talked and he shouldn't take the blame it's her fault and she enjoys talking to him.

We meet up with friends Sunday morning for brunch. She sends and receives several texts throughout our time with said friends. When I'm near her and her phone, she flips it face down on the table. She has to go home to finish up some work, fine...I can afford to catch up on some work too. 

We spend the rest of the day side by side, noses to laptops tapping away at our respective keyboards. I glance over to see if she's working on anything interesting. SURE IS! iMessage....with John. ALL. FUCKING. DAY. I'm shaking from fury.

Any advice?


**TL;DR;**

Wife has a new guy friend from work that I don't like. They spend several hours a day talking. ""He's cool as shit to talk to"". I was sick...skipped a bar night...wife drove new friend home and spent almost an hour sitting in the car in front of his house talking. After voicing my extreme displeasure, she secretly revealed displeasure to new friend and spends the rest of the weekend texting with him behind my back. I'm going out of my mind. Advice is appreciated.

-At 4:55pm (earliar that day) I was friends with her on facebook, Shortly After at 9:45pm when I checked it again, I was not.
-Sent pictures of her work and the flowers to her via phone. No response.
-Not one text message reply or answer from the mass amounts of texts I sent.
(Was snowing really bad that night)
-Saw heel snowprints LEAVING her apartment door, headed to the parking lot, only one set of prints around 10:30
- at 11:56pm I got 4 texts saying ""i love you"" ""happy New year"" nothing apologizing or asking why i was so upset.
-1:55pm new years day, Phone call from her. She asks if i ever want to speak to her again.
-She continued to apologize, but did not ask why I was so upset (hinting she knew what she did wrong)
-3:30pm Go to her apartment, it takes her  3-mins to answer the door. I ask to see her phone, All of the texts i had sent to her were deleted, All of her best friends texts, deleted. Only texts from me existed after 3am. Texts were to her mom dad saying happy new years. Thats it. She has a huge group of girl friends whos shes extremely close with, so if she was ""working"" it makes no sense that she would not wish them a happy new year, And their texts would all be deleted.

Her story is that she was working with her manager and her boss isnt supposed to know her manager is employing her for private home health care in a town 20mins from her work. She is willing to have her boss call me to verify she did work but who knows if her boss will be telling the truth or not. Every other fact I presented to her about what I noticed she does not have a logical explanation for. We recently have had NO problems. 
However I do know that before she was ""called into work"" she had plans to attend a party bus to go downtown. I am not friends or remotely familiar with any of the people who would be on it. That is my main suspicion for her to lie.

Please give me some constructive ways to go about getting the truth.

EDIT:Shes calling me crazy and laughing at me now at the things im saying dont add up. Bought me dinner and a massage on the second. 
Could she be trying to buy my happiness to get me to forget?

I love her a lot and although we have our ups and downs, I'd like to think that we have a future together. However, her boss at work and her hang out from time to time and I think he is trying to make a move on her.

Last night I was trying to find a text which had a password for her blackberry email account that she got. In doing so, I saw a text from earlier where he said, ""want to come over and be my cuddle buddy?"" and she said ""yeah, maybe a bit later""...I asked her wtf this was and she said that he often talks pretending to be his dog and that his dog wanted to cuddle with her, not him. She also said he will send other texts saying the dog misses her and wants to see her and things of the sort.

Maybe I'm just letting the fact that I'm in love blind me (because I realize it appears to be ridiculous) but I believe her when she says she has never cuddled with him and that he was referring to his dog. However, even if this is the case, I think the guy is trying to make a move because what guy would ever say stuff like ""want to be my cuddle buddy"" and not be interested in making a move? I'm pretty certain he is trying to get with the girl I love, and it pisses me off that he has no integrity.

I'm pretty sure I'm not overreacting but I'd like to see what some unbiased people think. So what do you think reddit?



**Edit:** She knows me too well...I told her I asked for some unbiased opinions about things and she knew what my favorite website was (reddit) and searched around until she found this thread.

A lot of what she saw on here has been upsetting (understandably). She stands by the fact that she never cheated, and I believe that. Was she receptive to his flirting? I hope not...I hate that she said she'd go over later and be his ""cuddle buddy"" whether it was the dog or him.

With that said, she has admitted to me that she agrees that he was trying to get with her. However, she swears nothing physical happened and I believe her.

At this point, things are either going to get a lot better or there won't be anything left to make better.


For those of you that offered honest, well-intentioned advice...I appreciate that and thank you for the words of wisdom.

He's started to talk about how if I got pregnant, he'd marry me and we'd keep the baby. I've always been clear on the fact that I'd have an abortion. About the same time he started talking about what we'd do in case of an accident, he's gotten a lot more lax with condom use, and gets annoyed if I insist he uses one, and doesn't like to wait for me to put in my diaphragm. 

This has been going on for about a month, and I'm completely weirded out (and stopped having penetrative sex with him the third time the birth control argument went down).

I'm not, right? I'm feeling like something is off, and I'm pretty sure I have good reason. I'm mostly looking for some support that I'm not crazy, and this is weird and sort of controlling.

When I first met her sister I thought something was a little off and now it has really come to a head.

Let me tell you about her.

S is 30 and has never lived out of home. She doesn't drive despite living in a fairly rural area. She has only ever held down one job, training as an enrolled nurse, but quit 4 days until graduating from the course. Since then (7-8 years ago) she has not done anything productive with her life. She volunteers at an elderly respite facility twice a week, but feels that she doesn't need a paying job. Her father is almost 60 and will be retiring soon and her mother doesn't work (as they are financially secure for her not to have to). Whenever the subject of S finding a job or making a claim though welfare she shuts down completely.

My wife and I believe that she has mild aspergers. She cannot handle any type of criticism and her opinion must be taken as gospel, if you argue with her or present an alternate way of thinking she insults your intelligence "" that's dumb only fucking idiots think like that""

We believe that she is waiting for my wife's grandmother to pass, so that she can live in her home.

I'm not saying that she is dumb. She can hold a conversation, albeit a dull one as everything she says is right, and generally comes across as a nice person.

Our concern is that she will become our responsibility after my wife's parents die, and I don't want her living with us. We are planning a family in the next couple of years and I really don't want to expose my children to her in case they think her behaviour is normal.

I am at a loss. Maybe you have some suggestions about what we can do about her.

We live in Australia so have a great welfare system available, but she won't get the dole or disability pension.

Thinking about I makes me angry and creates a great deal of tension not only I our family but the extended family as well.

1369079306.0,92,self.relationship_advice,1epp9m,I (27/m) think that my girlfriend of three years (26/f) cheated on me. She feels otherwise. Help?,anaccountthatexists,123,31,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1epp9m/i_27m_think_that_my_girlfriend_of_three_years_26f/,"I’ve never understood how to open posts like these, so I’ll just jump into it.


In late December my girlfriend of three years received an email from her ex. This particular ex is someone that she described as being her first true love who she would always have very strong feelings for them. They had been out of contact for the past five years because he was extremely abusive emotionally, manipulative, and routinely made threats toward her second and third boyfriends after him.


This email was the standard “I’ve changed and want you to see it, we should always be friends” missive that scorned past lovers send. She did not tell me about it. In early January, with the encouragement of a mutual friend, they opened contact and began speaking to one another by text. She did not tell me about it. I found out when he began routinely insulting me across her social media accounts, openly, and confronted her about it. She said that they began talking so that she could gauge her remaining remaining feelings for him, and that since she had confirmed to herself there was nothing there, she could cut contact again and not feel any regret. She framed it as a benefit for our relationship. Obviously, this did not happen. 


Her response to me finding out was to become extremely protective of her communications with other people, withdraw from me emotionally, and attempt to keep her phone protected at all times. What this meant was easy enough to see, so a month and a half later I read her conversations with him. I left for the gym very angrily afterward and she pieced together why immediately, telling me that she had only spoken over the past few days. This was a lie. She said once again that she would cut contact with him. Obviously, this did not happen. Again.


Unwilling to embrace my inner naiveté and in truth being a very paranoid, insecure person, I started monitoring her texts...over the course of five months. This went on far longer than it should have for a variety of reasons (denial, fear, anger, etc) but I did it and that cannot be changed. During this period their (daily!) conversations were almost entirely about these topics: that he still loved her and would only ever been happy if their relationship was as a couple, and that she loved him but did not want to be in that kind of relationship; him asking her to take pictures for his fetishes and her denying him coyly, but obliging him in sending “normal” pictures via snapchat; her desperately trying to convince him to visit her in Las Vegas, which is a state we do not live in; him telling her that if they met he would need to have sex with her, and her saying that “she had strong willpower” coyly; various protestations of how much they love one another; both of them saying that they were happy when the other was without a spouse (and could only be happy if the other was without a spouse); and her all but begging him not to be upset with her and calling him in a panic if he stopped responding for more than twenty minutes. She referred to him as “my love” and “love”. He routinely insulted me without reproach. Also they talked about Star Trek. A bit.


These conversations took up the bulk of her time outside of the house. She would leave for class or work, immediately begin talking to him and only him, and come home in a certain mood depending on how those conversations went. This was very plain to see. 


Simultaneously, our relationship has been deteriorating for a variety of reasons. I suffer from a very rare, extremely painful seasonal disease that is accompanied by major depression. Dealing with both of these things in late February sent me spiraling into...well, I just didn’t care about things very much. I became very fatalistic about our relationship. I stopped trying to “be better”, if that makes sense. I thought this might add some additional context, but who knows. I don’t consider it an excuse on my end. I read my girlfriends' private conversations for five months. I became insular and bitter. That’s wrong, and I accept it.


The final straw was Friday, when she practically grovelled at his feet to forgive her over something innocuous. She wrote that she “Could never lose him again” and wanted him to “be with her forever”. He responded the same. They said they loved each other. I lost it, and confronted her when she came home. This is a very long story already, so suffice to say this did not go well. She stared blankly while I explained what I had done and that I had read everything. She left after a weak apology and after crying a bit. She came home, went to sleep. Left in the morning. Came home, took a nap. Did not speak to me afterward. I couldn’t take it any more and confronted her again. Her stance is that what she did was not cheating, and that while elements of this relationship were inappropriate (exact words, there), I am overreacting and should be able to see that she values her relationship with me more than him. She says that she will stop talking to him. Again. For the third time. All of our conversations since have consisted of her defending this relationship, vigorously.


I think that it was cheating. I am hurt, confused, and angry. More than anything maybe I just needed to write this out and read it to confirm those feelings, but I would like to know if my reaction here is wrong and if I am being too jealous or...something. Anything.


If anyone made it through this massive wall of text, I congratulate you, and sincerely appreciate you taking the time. It means a lot. Any and all advice is appreciate.


tl;dr: my girlfriend has been texting her ex for five months and lied about it twice. They talk almost exclusively about how much they love each other and flirt sexually.

--------

First, I'd like to thank everyone for their answers. Whether insightful or transgressive, they were read and acknowledged (privately).

Yeah, so hours after having posted to RA/R about this, my husband came home from work and told me he had read them. He's an avid redditor, but our subreddit interests are somewhat different that I didn't expect him to look at RA or R.

He hugged me and gave me a big smile. Mostly, as he said, I wasn't trying to run away from the problem, rather I was looking for help as to how to take it on. And that meant a lot to him. As of then, I never wanted to look back again. It wasn't easy, but I achieved it: I forgave myself and am moving on. 

So I began talking. About my feelings, my day, but mostly: why I love him. Everyday I tell him why I like him and why I'm lucky to have him. And he never grows tired of it. If anything, it's boosted his confidence and performance at work and, ah, well-- other areas.

In turn, he's begun speaking to me. He tells me thoughts and opinions without the fear of my now-lessened oversensitivity. He's not done much of this before, and while great, it certainly has us butting heads-- because my confidence is growing, too. 

I began with dressing myself up a bit everyday, even if I didn't go out. Then I added making the bed. Then I added Khan Academy vids, Project Euler problems to boost my confidence in my intelligence, then it kinda grew from there. 

Since our confidences have shot up for both of us, so has conflict. However, we both knew it's part of a growth process. He's now more vocal with his needs, and now I stand up for myself. A large amount of the issues that have plagued us from the very beginning of our relationship have been talked about and resolved. We're also beginning to speak in each other's language of love: his being touch/action, mine being talk/gifts. It's working out wonderfully. 

I'm currently looking for work in SF as I'm finish my paperwork for graduation: college is over, yay! Hubs is looking at some major positive developments at work, and we're becoming more socially active; I had no idea our friends missed us. We both give credit to our increasingly ideal home life. We're making it happen, and it's great. 

To those who find themselves in a similar situation as I was: If you're truly sorry for your actions, and you say you're willing to do anything because you love this person with everything you've got: do it. Change for the better, become a bigger contribution to your relationship and to society. *Especially let them know how much they're wanted.*

But most importantly: truly learn from your mistakes, and forgive yourself.

Because when you do, happiness in a relationship thrives. No more dark clouds of regret or guilt. Just smiles, kisses and love. 

While I'm nowhere near an expert on relationships, I hope my story will help someone about to make the mistake, living with it, and/or dealing with the consequences. I'm lucky as fuck to have a man who stayed. Even if yours doesn't, resolve the baggage: your next love doesn't deserve your sadness over another relationship. 
I hope this has helped. And thank you again. 

**Tl;dr: Forgave myself, moved on. Floatin' on cloud 9 with husband. Thanks y'all. &lt;33**

**EDIT:** I just wish to clarify that in no way, shape or form do I believe I'm off the hook. If anything, I'll probably never really let myself off the hook. I'm well aware of what I'm capable of, and active prevention against that is having a partner/friends to help check your blind spots and have open communication with your SO. At least, that's how it's been working out for me. These last few months since my last post have been like a large exhalation. I know hard times will come ahead, but right now, I'm certain that we'll be able to take on that challenge. The fear of losing my husband is far, far, far bigger than my fear of being alone or my need of constant attention. He is my best friend, my companion, my lover, and I'll do my damnedest to make sure he knows that. If I have to do that for the rest of my life, I'm very willing to do it. :)",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1359072516.0,,,True,t3_177kra,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/177kra/update_cheated_on_husband_a_long_time_ago_i/,

Down the road from my home is a married couple and I'm good friends with both the husband and the wife. I get along with both of them famously. We hang out often and we have a lot of fun. There has a been a few times she has flirted with me, but nothing obscene, but she has never done it in front of her husband. I try to not to flirt back as best I can, despite how innocent it may be... but I have to admit... over the past few years, I've fallen in love with this woman. 

She once said to me that ""If ever my husband and I don't work out, I'm going to be knocking on your door"" and just recently she told me ""I wish I had met you before I met my husband"". This hurts me emotionally, because I'm totally into her, and apparently she's into me, but there is nothing I can do about it. I would never touch her out of the friendship with her husband. Although they both seem happily married (he's kind of old fashioned and can be a bit controlling, but nothing near abusive) and they have three kids, I saw it was getting too dangerous being around her. It wouldn't take too many drinks for something to happen. 

So, I've kind of distanced myself from them. Unfortunately, I think she got the idea, but her husband is kind of miffed at me for being so distant, like I don't want to be his friend anymore, which isn't true. I still want to be friends with both of them, but I don't want to have to kill it because of her and I. What should I do?

She left he facebook open, and I saw a live chat going on between her and a guy she met at her workplace.

First, she was talking to her friend (a girl) and telling her that she talked to him last night on the phone for over 3 hours and that she's ""back in love"". 

Just as I read that, I see that she's also talking live to this guy.

To give you a quick skim of the chat (selected and translated parts):

--------------------------------------

She: I like younger guys.

Him: Like me ? ;)

She: Exactly like you!

--------------------------------------
She: Stop saying that, it's too cute!

Him: And cute isn't good?

She: No... because it's good, and that's not good.

--------------------------------------

She: I think you hate me after the last night talk on the phone.

Him: No, why would I?

She: You know very well... as I hung up... it happened.

She: When I hung up all those feelings I told you about came back.

Him: And are you sorry about it?

She: I don't know, I dreamed about you again.

Him: Did we do naughty stuff in the dream?

She: Stop it! We were just kissing.

Him: And did you wake up happy?

She: Just like my cover picture *she has a cover picture with a guy kissing a girl on a car*

She:  That's why I have this cover picture.

--------------------------------------



She: But really, you would love to kiss me like this on the car.

Him: Yeah, I would really like to kiss you under the moonlight.

--------------------------------------



She: So, you like me... admit it!

Him: Yep

She: Since when? Before or after you left?

Him: Since then...

Him: Don't get me wrong, I'm not in love with you or anything, but I really like you. Yout smile, your laugh, your jokes...

She: I hate you! Why the hell didn't you say anything when I told you I like you?

Him: I didn't want to get in your life. 

She: But that's not your decision! You understand?

She: You know that saying... better regret something you did than something you didn't do.

--------------------------------------

Him: I don't wanna talk on FB anymore wanna call me?

She: Yes, I'l call you now.



------------------------------------

After about 5 minutes, she talks with her girl friend again saying that she feels like crying... but at least it's over. * I don't know what to make of this*

I would also like to mention that she was CONSTANTLY deleting all messages with him. Like ever 2-3 minutes she was deleting the messages and there's no log of their conversation.. Luckily I saved it all.

So, I don't want to add any of my sentiments, I just want your honest and brutal answer. 

Am I over-reacting? Is she out of line? And what is my next step? What should I do next? 

I want to confront her but she could easily weasel out of any real answers. Please help.

My GF of more than a year decided to pay a visit to her parents, which live pretty far away, but I've got this feeling that she might be doing something else also. I've been able to access her FB account - I know, I know, I don't like it either and I'm feeling really bad for doing this. But…

I've found out she's a helluva sexter. Guys she's been dating and had sex with before me, and others that are still trying - she's keeping in touch with all of them, and by that, I mean that every message contains something that implies on past or future sex endeavours - and she's taking lead. She's meeting one of her ex-fuckers this afternoon. **She told me that she's meeting her classmate!**

As much as I'd like to believe she's just sexting, I'm afraid there's more to it. Nonetheless, I want to tackle this with a cool head - a thing I'm not really good at. 

I'd like her to explain herself, tell me why she's done so and what is she getting out of it, and if she'd be OK with it if the tables were turned. Is this cool enough? Also, I'd definitely need some proof, if she tells me it's just sexting. Can there even be such a thing? She's coming back in three days, should I wait or say something right nao? 

I need your advice guys… What would you do in this situation? 
Thanks.

Sorry I cannot reply to all you good people, I'm at work, but do know that I appreciate each and every comment.

While watching American beauty, a short scene appears with a dead bird. She can't take the imagery, and turns away. No big deal. However, by time the lady gets the gun at the end, she couldn't take it. She decided to go upstairs and let me finish it alone. No big deal, right?

I get up there to comfort her, she says I'm a bad boyfriend, I need to protect her, that her mom would never subject her to such a horrific movie. 

She says that anytime she sees something bad or scary, that it stays with her for life. That when she closes her eyes, looks in a mirror, or looks into darkness, she sees that scary stuff and it terrifies her. 

She told me I'm a bad guy for tricking her into seeing such a bad movie. I though it was good- haven't seen what happens after that gunshot yet though.

She has a huge heart and is extremely clever. Unfortunately, I don't find her physically attractive which has put a strain on our marriage since the beginning. My previous ex I went after solely because of her appearance and that was about the best thing I could say about her. My wife is not unpleasant to look at, but she is a bit overweight and plain looking. I know I'm a total ass to even think about  her this way, much less type it out. I wanted to marry her because of who she was, not what she looked like. I had thought the physical attraction would come later and since looks don't last, this would surely be a good decision. While we were dating, we had sex often, though she always initiated. Once we got married, she decided she shouldn't have to initiate sex all the time and since ultimately her personality is a bit shy and conservative, she wanted me to initiate in the more traditional way a man would with his wife. To this day, I may have initiated sex once or twice in our whole marriage. I want to have sex on a regular basis (2-3 times per week), but I guess I don't get jazzed up about it. She can certainly arouse me, but that's not the same as attraction. I think our yearly average is less than 5 times having sex and we did not at all last year.

This creates a vicious cycle in our marriage because I am continually hurting her and making her feel insecure and doubting her worth, not intentionally, of course. I want to view her as the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I want my loins to burn with passion when we're alone. I don't know how to get to that point.

What does Reddit think? I've thought about posting for a long time and I've made many excuses for why things are so bad in our marriage. I am not sure where to turn at this point.

Maybe six months in, things were going amazing and we were both getting out of shitty leases, so we decided to just bite the bullet and try and move in together. To this day, it's been fantastic. She's my best friend, she's gorgeous, is working on a masters degree in occupational therapy (we initially bonded over loving public health), and is basically the perfect person to live with (also, she's caucasian).

The issue is my parents. I'm from a sorta traditional Indian family. I'm in medical school, almost done, and my parents can't deal with my dating/living with her. She was able to visit their home one time, which was bad enough to bring her to tears on our drive home. Afterwards, my dad told me that he couldn't believe I was seeing such a 'mediocre' person. I've asked both my mother and father to elaborate, but they can't actually give me anything more than that. I care really deeply for this girl and have had a little trouble having decent conversations with my folks about her, as they inevitably say something that is mind-bogglingly hurtful and I just have to kill the conversation. The big thrust of my parents' argument is that I am doing great in school, am good looking, (my dad's repeatedly called me 'the most eligible bachelor', which is fucking creeptown), and shouldn't be slumming it.

This all came to a head yesterday. Her parents have been super supportive about the relationship and upon hearing that I wanted to try to make both family's thanksgiving meals, they changed their plans, woke up at 4 AM, and made their family meal a lunch instead of a dinner, so that we (I hoped) could make it back to the city to go to my folks. Yesterday, my dad drops that she is not welcome at our family's thanksgiving. I had to put my foot down, I attended her family's celebration, and as a result no one in my family will speak to me. I've come to their house for the weekend, where my dad insists that if I want to stay and speak with them, I have to tell the rest of the family (aunt, uncles, grandma) that I was tied up in the emergency room for thanksgiving dinner.

I'm not really sure what to do. While I've never been super close to my folks, I want to keep them in my life, but I don't know how else I can make them understand the two directions I'm being pulled in. On the one, I have a wonderful partner. On the other hand, I have a good family who's been acting really hard to deal with for the past year (my mom recently tried to set me up with another girl. While I was seeing my partner). 

I just don't know what to do. I want to make my partner happy and leaving her is just not an option, but at the same time I want my family to give her an actual chance, although I can't force them.

But in summary, I've been with a girl for 2.5 years (I'm a guy). Over the past year, there were 2-3 incidents where we got in a big argument at her house and she resorted to physical force to do one of the following:
* Get my attention (e.g. pulling my arm hard, slapping my chest)
* Prevent me from leaving her place (grab onto me, thereby scratching me, grab my clothes so i couldn't get dressed, putting arms around me, pushing against door) because she wanted to deal with the issue
* Express anger/frustration (hitting me, slapping my face, pushing back, grabbing my skin with her nails)

I'm (obviously?) physically stronger and bigger than her, but in these situations I became trapped and effectively held against my will because I can't exactly knock her out or beat her up, and while she is grabbing me/clothes/door, there is nothing I can do.

This has happened about 2 times before, and afterwards she is always sorry and saying it's because she gets so sad/angry when I don't listen to her etc etc. I told her last time that violence, for me, is NEVER a possibility and if she were to do this again, regardless of the situation/how angry she is, then it's over.

This happened again last night and I finally managed to leave her place at 4:30 am (after 1+ hour of struggling) and going to my place. She came over about 4 hours later and I told her to leave, finally I physically pushed her out of the apartment, took my keys from her, and she left.

Maybe most guys are more patient than me and are able to calm an angry/irrational girl (instead of getting frustrated/wanting to leave like me, or feeling explosively frustrated when I feel trapped in her house) or maybe most girls are not as insecure as my girlfriend (and hence would let their bf leave if he chose to). 

Ultimately, I know why she acted that way (sadness/anger that I am not as committed to the relationship as her, fear I will leave her, insecure because I hang up/leave her place many times when we have serious arguments)... however my arms/neck/back have many scratches today and I don't know what to do.

To top it off, it's her bday next week... 

what do you guys think? In my mind she abused me, but am I overreacting? How should I have dealt with this situation?

Dinner was good, just chatted about all sorts of stuff as we normally do. While waiting on the bill, he put his arm around me. We went home, popped open a bottle of wine, and watched a movie. During the last 5 or 6 minutes, he put his arm around me again. I just wished he'd have done it sooner! 

At 3:45am he finally says he needs to get going, so I walk him out to his car. When we get there, we turn to face each other. I put my hand on his cheek, rubbed it softly with my thumb, smiled and went in for the kill. Nailed it. As in, I kissed him. Yep. 

After I pulled back, I looked at him. He had a half-smile on his face. It was hard to interpret and I still don't know what to think about it. I gave him a hug, which he returned (though his hands were full of his belongings) and I told him to drive safe. That was that.

Last month, we decided we wanted to get married. 


He had a serious drinking problem before we met. He's estranged from his siblings, largely because of his own mistakes. When he decided to get sober, he started over completely - new city, new life, etc. 

Anyhow, on Sunday I got a call from his ex-wife. She hasn't had any contact with him since their divorce three years ago, but she heard through his family that we were getting married and felt the need to talk to me. 


She told me that my fiance hit her regularly. They were both pretty messed up, she says, and she wasn't always an innocent victim. But my fiance is 6'2"" and hefty, and she left him when the abuse consistently prevented her from working. She also told me that it was his violence and abuse that alienated him from his siblings. 


She didn't expect me to believe her, and so she gave me the contact information for my fiance's brother, who is prepared to verify all of this. They both think I'd be making a mistake to marry him. 

Which brings me to:


**A:** There's no way I'm going to call this guy. I really think that betraying my fiance like that would be a terrible, terrible idea. But should I confront him about it?  I don't want to push him in a bad direction or start something nasty, and I definitely don't know how he'd react if I knew I talked to his ex.

**B:** Even if this is true, how much should I really be worried? He works so hard to avoid his past mistakes. We've agreed to forgive each other for the lives we had before we met (I wasn't exactly a saint in my teens and early twenties).  I trust him. He still gets angry very easily, but I've never, ever seen him violent. But I can't stop thinking about it.

Wife is 10 years younger - met when she was 21 &amp; have lived together for 5 years - tied the knot a month ago.

Rarely fight, laugh a lot together, tons in common, friends/families both like each other.

The Heartbreak:

It seemed to be going so perfectly.  We live great together, hardly ever fight and even then it's always a smooth working to a resolution.  I give her lots of space and freedom and she lets me work on my artsy projects and we find time to spend at least a couple days out of the week together.  I asked her to marry me and she seemed so happy to all her friends and family, but a month before the wedding she suddenly dropped a bombshell.  She said she'd fallen out of love with me and wasn't even sure being married was what she wanted anymore.  She said I spend too much time on my art (which I tried to explain was for us, so that I could make a better living and life together) and not enough time with her.  It killed me to hear because she's my everything and I've tried so hard to make more money so we could live a better life, but I told her if she wanted to call off the wedding, she should.  She didn't and we moved forward.  I opened myself up even more and even though we weren't there yet, considered myself as her husband (more romantic gestures, little love notes, planning dates--all the things I've always promised myself I'd do if I had a wife).  Two days before the wedding she did it again, repeats of the same sentiments, and again even though it broke my heart, I told her it wasn't too late to back out, if that's what she really wanted.  Yet she insisted we push on.  The day of our wedding she was amazing and we pulled off an event for the history books.  Since that day I haven't changed: I leave her love notes in the mornings, try to make plans and dates, look after her things at home, keep the apartment clean, etc.  But a week after getting hitched she started pulling away again emotionally.  Finally, less than a month after the wedding, I told her she was breaking my heart and described the pain I was in as she got more and more detached.  She then tells me that I'm an amazing person and everything a woman could want in a guy, but that freaks her out and although she loves me, she's not in love with me and part of her just wants to pull stakes and go ""find herself"" alone.  It was gut-wrenching, but I held my ground.

The Now:

I told her I couldn't take the emotional distance--it is ripping me up inside--and she should leave.  I said she should pack a week's worth of clothes and go stay at a friend's and cut me out of her life so she could experience what life without me would be like.  No phone calls, no texts, no facebook, absolutely no contact with me until she figures it out.  Once she gets her head clear, if she wants to go, she's free to be alone--It's the most painful suggestion I've ever put forward to someone who I love with all my heart.  And I can't talk to anyone about it!  Her dad thinks I'm great and has told her that she'll probably never find someone as good for her as me again, but he won't communicate with me (his loyalty is with her and that's understandable).  My parents are over-religious and only suggest a lot of prayer (it may work for them but I get nothing out of it).  Our friends adore us and I don't want them to gang up on her for hurting me.  I've never felt so alone.

The Questions:

Did I do the right thing?  Is there any hope she'll come back?

Recently I went to visit her at her family's house and used her computer, by chance opening up an email between her and someone who I learned was her sugar daddy (until just a week ago).

I confronted her and she admitted to it. The relationship had been going on the past four months. He gave her money, bought her shiny things, in exchange for dinner and sex twice a month. We have been planning on moving in together since January, waiting for the opportunity to arrive in July.

She says she was worried about money. She doesn't have a job where we're moving and she wanted to be comfortable (this is not very true; she has enough cash on hand to last a few months). She said she never wanted me to find out. She wanted to end this and then to bury it and start a new chapter. The email exchange I read was their back and forth after she had ended things between them.

After a lot of talking, I didn't end things. In fact, I even agreed to stay together and go ahead with moving in. I want to forgive her for this; I believe she did this for the money/power/excitement of the sex work and not for the romance. I love her and I believe her when she says she loves me.

Is it insane to move in right after this comes to light? Is it crazy to keep on with the relationship? Does anyone have advice on how to move past and act of dishonesty - but not of disloyalty? I'm angry at her - something I've never felt. But I also still care deeply and believe in the sincerity of her regret. It's not the sex with another guy that bothers me (for the most part).

My girlfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years. I'm mad about this girl, we have the same sense of humor, she is sweet, beautiful, contagiously positive, smart, the list goes on and on.

Growing up she has always been told by people ""you're so beautiful, but you're fat."" Because of this she developed an eating disorder in high school and early in college. Ever since getting over her disorder she's decided that she wasn't going to be one of those girls who watches what she eats or feels guilty every time she puts something in her mouth.I met her about a year later.

Like I said, we've been dating for 2 years and over the last eight months or so, she's been gaining a lot of weight, probably 30-40 lbs, and there are no signs it's slowing down. There is no mystery as to why, the girl never exercises. On top of that, she is always eating chocolate bars and candy and recently, over the last two months or so, she's decided she's going to have dessert with every dinner. I'm not exaggerating. Last week, she had 2 bowls of ice cream on Monday, on Tuesday she picked up a chocolate cake on her way home from work and had a slice of it after dinner that night, Wednesday, Thursday, and finished it on Friday. You get the idea.

It's not even the weight that bothers me though. I'm still very much attracted to her and the sex is still amazing. What bothers me is that she doesn't even make an effort to be healthy. I am a very active person, I exercise 3-4 times a week and run almost every day, she never does anything.

I would love to be with this girl for a very long time, but the fact is I don't want to end up with someone who is going to have self-induced health problems in 20 years. I love doing outdoor activities, skiing, hiking, mountain climbing, and I want her to be able to do them with me for the rest of our lives. I don't want to worry about her getting arthritis or back problems or heart problems because if we end up together, I want it to be for as close to forever as we can manage.

I've tried inviting her on my morning runs and asking her if she'd like to come to the gym with me but she always makes up some excuse for not going. I've tried offering desserts that are less bad for you like fruit. I don't know how else to broach the subject. I brought this up to my parents, and they say I should tell her, you either start taking care of yourself or I'm leaving. I don't want her to think I'm just another person saying ""you're beautiful but you're fat"" but I also don't want to stick around and watch her slowly destroy her health.
What can I do? How can I bring this up without offending her?

So I was in the neighbourhood and thought I'd share a quick/amusing update that a lot of you predicted. So basically if you didn't get this from the TL;DRs above, I started seeing this guy officially for about half a year now and we started out as friends with benefits. His bestie didn't like that, confronted me on facebook and continued to be a royal bitch. Anyways, he dealt with it and we've been going strong. 

BUT THEN last month she did something crazy. Remember I said she broke up with her boyfriend a while back? And then all of you said she had deeper feelings for Link? Well *guess fucking what*... she **came out** about her feelings for him and tried seducing him while they were studying in her room one night (since they live across from eachother in dorms). She started like, rubbing his leg and whatever and he was like WTF and NOPED the fuck out of there, called me immediately and texted her that they couldn't be friends anymore with her feeling this way for him. I was so proud of him, I took him out for steak and.. a little treat when we got back to his place too that night, haha. 

So yup, she's pretty much out of the picture now. She was harassing him that first week trying to say she wasn't thinking straight, that she missed being in a relationship, and my favourite.. that she was just desperate and wanted what we had, realizing now what a great boyfriend he would be. He ended up blocking her number/deleting her facebook and all that and she eventually gave up. We see her now and then at friend group functions, but she knows to leave us alone and has stopped with the snarky comments.  

All in all things are super great! Kinda sad I didn't get to punch her in the face though. Ah well, maybe next time!

He told me that he thought we were at a point in our relationship where he didn't have to act like he cared. That's when I got pissed. I told him he should always make it a priority to make me feel special and appreciated and if he didn't understand that it wasn't going to work.

She's got an EXTREMELY high sex drive (We could have sex every day and she'd still be masturbating a ton) and I have a fairly average one (sex a couple times a week is good). So we don't sync up when it comes to that at all. The real problem though is the way that she acts with it, like sex is something that I owe to her. 

At least a few times a day I hear her complain about being super horny and usually I'm busy at that moment with schoolwork or a conversation online or just in general occupied, and she seems annoyed when I don't just jump at the chance to satisfy her. Yesterday she told me ""If you've got time to go on Facebook, you've got time to have sex"" while i was taking a break from a big homework session. To top it off, she also complains that I never initiate sex either.

Its not that a conversation with a friend, or a video game, or reading, or whatever activity I'm doing at that moment is more important than her. Its that I'm constantly getting badgered for sex so I'm desensitized to it.
At the risk of sounding disrespectful towards her, I really don't mean this in a negative way, only as a tool for better explanation, sex is a devalued commodity for me. Its constantly available and being asked of me so I'm not exactly running to meet it like I was when I was a teenager.

I feel like if anyone heard of a guy acting like this towards his girlfriend he would be seen as a misogynist, treating his girlfriend like a sexual object. But she doesn't see it this way.

When I try to talk to her about it she gets upset and says that I make her feel guilty for having a sex drive, that she feels unattractive to me, and that (as I mentioned above) it bugs her why she always has to be the one initiating.

Ok so, she keeps throwing marriage around, claiming she isn't getting any younger, and would like to be married before we have a kid (she's not prego). We had a LDR for a year before we moved in together. She has a BA and was living in a city where she could use it, where we live it's not really relevant, nor are there jobs relating to her field (except teaching). So she is going to school for a MA in law. 
She claims before me, and up until recently she didn't want to be married, and only wants to be married to me. She says she wants to be married by time she is 30 (that's next year) so we can have 1 or 2 kids before she is 35. She doesn't want anything crazy, I think she quoted the total cost at $4000 for everything. $900 for the service and photographer on the beach...  
My thing, I don't have a great enough job to support her yet. I don't have a BA (i'm working on it) and my parents still contribute a lot to my living expenses. (though she would prefer if we did it on our own.) I do want to marry her, someday. 
She says if we don't have plans (ie a ring) before Easter, she is going to leave me, drop out of school, to pursue her original career, 10,000 miles away. 
Is her ultimatum justified? Am I a total dick? I'm lost and need your help. Please put things into perspective.

I was looking for an old thumb drive I had saved some papers on and just decided to try out every one I found in my dad's desk.  First ones didn't have anything that interested me on them, then I came across some that had documents named ""Psychology"" and other classes I had taken so I looked into the other documents.

Some of them were just old papers that belonged to my step-sister (we're the same age, so we took most of the same high school and college courses) and some just had dates.  Upon looking at the ones with dates, I came across a detailed description of my sister recounting being sexually abused by my older brother at a young age.

I know I shouldn't have looked further into it, but curiosity got the best of me.  According to the entries, my brother had been abusing her for as long as she can remember up until he moved out (about ten years ago, we are both 22 now and he is ~30).

We grew up in a mixed-family household, with some of my siblings being whole siblings, some half, some step.  My mother married my step-father when my step-sister and I were around two, so we have been together most of our lives.  My brother is my full brother (same parents) and my step-sister is my step-father's daughter from a previous marriage.

In no part of these entries does she mention that she has told anyone else or that anything came of it.  I know I shouldn't have been snooping, but now I don't know what to do.

We've been dating for about a year now. I'm 23, she's 21. 

My question is how do I bring this up with her? I doubt anything is going to change when I do. Which is unfortunate, because I do love her very much, and she says she loves me very much. Every aspect of our relationship is good except the intimate part. 

We have nice long conversations. We like the same TV shows and music. We both enjoy traveling, and have been on a few trips together.

We don't really ever fight, which may be a problem. I've read couples that fight tend to be closer after they make up. 

The other night she was over at my apartment and we watched a movie. After the show was over we started kissing. I started bringing it a little farther then she pushed me away and said ""I didn't come here for that!"". Then she accused all men of only thinking about sex in a very condescending tone. I hadn't made a physical move like this for about 2 weeks... 

I'm really upset about this. I've never gotten along so well with a girlfriend before. Her parents think I'm awesome, and my parents love her. We have similar ambitions and get along awesome. I'm very much attracted to her, and she says she is to me...

When she's been drinking she's into physical stuff. But we haven't gone drinking together for a long time because she said she doesn't want all of our sexual experiences to be when shes drunk...

So I need advice. How should I approach this? What can I say? I don't want to sound accusing, but the problems seem to all be hers. I really love her and don't want to end this, but if it doesn't change I'll have to. It's very frustrating :/

**edit:
Worth noting, when she's been drinking she's crazy into it. She says things like ""we should do this all the time!"" but then the next morning she'll say something to the effect ""I don't want all our experiences to be drunk. we need to stop drinking together, or just not drinking as much.""

Shame its for something like this.

My girlfriend went away to a popular student destination with a lot of friends of hers, and I didn't hear from her all week until about 5pm today when she called me after getting back onto home soil and her phone would work again.

She asked me if I was alone and sitting down 'cause she had to tell me something; immediately I'm thinking 'oh shit what's happened, has she cheated on me? Has she lost something? Is she injured?' and my heart is racing. She says to me, 'something happened with someone and sex was involved but I didn't cheat on you. If you get what I mean'. Her voice was quivering at telling me this, so I could tell she was scared and shaken about it. So I just stayed calm and asked 'were you raped?' to which she said after a moment's silence, 'yes.'

I was immediately in shock. What the fuck? I asked her how it had happened, and from what she could manage to tell me through being all fucked up about it it seems that she had left something in her hotel room and told her friends to go ahead and she'd catch up after getting what it was she'd forgotten. She got back to the hotel and got into a lift along with a man who her friends only knew as 'the guy upstairs'. **CHECK THE EDIT PART AT THE BOTTOM FOR AN UPDATE ON THIS BIT** He was wasted, and made a move on her, she resisted and a struggle ensued. In the struggle her head was hit off the wall of the lift and she blacked out, waking up sometime later naked only with her shoes on next to this lad who had sobered up and was crying because he has a girlfriend and has only just realised what he's done.

She then started crying as the realisation of all that happened set in and she had just had sex with someone who isn't me. The guy then had the audacity to ask her if she could stay with him a while to comfort each other. She left, obviously, and went back to her room. This part's a bit sketchy because she was starting to cry down the phone so it either happened in her room, in the corridor or in his room, I don't know, but I'm not going to push for information.

When packing to come home she found a t-shirt of his and binned it along with all the clothes and shoes she wore at the time. Bad move, no DNA.

She doesn't know his name, and all there is is a photograph with him in it on her friend's camera. The police won't be able to do much without DNA and conclusive evidence, but getting them involved is not my place, she told me not to involve them so I'm not going to. That's her parent's job.

I'm just at a complete loss. I've sat here for the past two hours with a close friend just talking it through and I've decided to go home tomorrow to be with her and let her know that I'm here for her.

Has anyone else had this experience or any advice or anything at all? I want to find the guy and fuck him up something rotten but that would just make things worse... at the very least I want his girlfriend to know.

**tl;dr** My girlfriend got raped on holiday, I'm in shock. There is little evidence so a conviction will most likely not be made. Advice / anecdotes / proposed solutions would be awesome.

...

**EDIT** Just got off the phone with her, she's home safely now. She didn't really say much, she was crying in her room; I've never heard my girlfriend cry. This, to me, just proves more that this story is true... she's a hard knock and this is massive. Didn't really get much more information except that she was wearing a dress and it happened in her room (keycards are numbered in this hotel and she kept it in her clutch bag over her shoulder, easy place to find it). Going to suggest requesting CCTV from the hotel; lifts usually have cameras in nowadays.

...

**BIG EDIT** As I said, the ending of the story didn't really come across well; she was crying, phone signal and noise in the background weren't exactly helpful. I have spoken to her since and found that it wasn't in the elevator that she fell, the man followed her from the elevator to her room, which is where the struggle started. That is my bad for misunderstanding and posting that on here. This explains how he got to her room and into it and all that.

To all the people who are pointing out plot holes; let me trust my girlfriend. The signal on the phone wasn't the best, she was trying to be quiet so as not to tell everyone on the coach around her about it and there was a lot of chatter in the background. I should've cleared that up at the start, but my mind wasn't exactly thinking straight. I've filled in quite a big plot hole now, but please respect that I trust my girlfriend and will be sticking beside her during this, you have to be here to understand completely I suppose.

**Massive thanks to all the kind words from people who are trying to help!**

**MAJOR UPDATE!**
I've just got back from seeing her in person for the first time since she went on holiday, and I can confirm that this is a girl who is telling the truth. I arrived at her house and she was sat in the back garden scrubbing her shoes clean, she had been cleaning all her clothes all night - even ones she didn't take with her on holiday. She has injuries on her face and back, bite marks and a bruise which is very obviously from where a hand has held her too firmly.

**She told me the entire story again, and it checks out completely on my bullshit radar, she's telling the truth.**

We went and got her hair cut; she wants to get rid of how she was. She went for her third shower of the day. She sat and cried in front of me, which she has never done and said that she feels so dirty and like I shouldn't even be caring for her. She feels like she has cheated on me, but there is NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. She hasn't.

Going to the hospital first thing tomorrow for STI checks etc.
She's breaking the news to her parents as I type this, the police will most likely be informed after.

As for how she acts, she was very twitchy and flinched a lot at first if I just came near her, but I let her take complete control of everything. After a few hours of just sitting there comforting her when she needed it and talking to her she came to me and kissed me, then backed off, looked at me for a moment and said 'that wasn't as bad as I imagined it would be'. Before I left she wrapped her arms around me and kissed me, told me she loves me and thanked me for being there. She's going to be just fine, I think, given some time!

**UPDATE AGAIN**

Saw her again today, went to the hospital but the website hasn't been updated; they don't do drop in sessions on Tuesdays and there was no space free and no appointments until next week, so we're going again tomorrow. She's a lot less twitchy and was happier today.

As for people thinking this is all bullshit, fuck you. You're not here and you're not in this situation.

My ex and I had a rough relationship for a year - but we kept it together after a few breakups.  She was the first girl I had ever truly loved, and I've been hurting ever since we broke up.  We broke simply because she said she couldn't handle long distance (even though she told me this a mere 2 hours after telling me in a handwritten Christmas card that she would think about me everyday and would look forward to hugging/kissing in the future).  It hurt, but I was able to deal. However, I just recently found out that when I left where she was (due to graduating) she and him had already planned over a month before she broke up with me that he was going to move in with her when they came back from winter break.  She had told him all along that we were ""just friends"", even though she told me the love she had for me was as intense and as powerful as her first love (which she had for more than a few years).  

He had found that when they came back, many people have been giving them negative vibes, and he talked to another of my friends about it, who explained that there was in fact something in between us. He told my friend that he wanted to apologize to me through a Facebook message, but couldn't since he was blocked.  I told my friend that he could call me, and I would talk.  

Is it wrong to tell him how manipulative she is? Her true nature?  I want to save him from her - he seems like a nice enough guy.  I don't want to seem pathetic, but I also see the opportunity to prevent as much pain for him down the road. However, I can just take the apology and leave it at that.  What does Reddit have to say? 

EDIT:  Reddit, thank you for all of your input.  I've found that in my current state, I cannot talk to him without feeling like my heart/soul will be ripped out.  Even talking to my friends about it just in light passing seems to be a trigger for depression, so how much more would that be amplified if I talked to him?  If my emotional/inner integrity are compromised when I'm talking to him, I would probably found myself worse afterwards.

So of course, he tried to do it much more tactfully. Claiming my messed up eating habits, and my own insecurities at my weight gain were affecting how often I wanted to go out in public and spend time with his circle of friends, which I have to admit are valid. But he did admit that it was also a very physical attractiveness thing as well.

I have always had a love/hate relationship with food. Out eating full grown man regularly. I usually manage to keep my weight in about a 5kg (10 pound) fluctuation range by balancing my overeating with strict dieting and healthy eating, and I have been doing that for about 10 years now. However, at the beginning of the year, my personal life got dramatically harder for a while, and on top of that my ex boyfriend who I cared very much for committed suicide. This led to a 10kg (20 pound) weight gain (comfort eating). Once that was over, I plateaued out again and am not gaining weight, but have also not managed to lose the weight. I am mortified at it, but am struggling to lose the weight. Yes my confidence has been affected.

My issue now is that I don't know what to do from here. To be honest while he was telling me (over facebook IM) I felt nothing but amusement. I mean, how many times do you see this question being asked on the front page of Askreddit by guys not wanting to hurt their girlfriends feelings?

Now that the conversation is over, I feel nothing. This love that I have felt for this guy for 2 years has seemingly entirely evaporated. I don't want to spend time with him, and I don't want him touching me. I'm guessing I have some major protective mechanisms kicking in right now. I want to lose weight, that was never the problem, but now I almost don't now because I despise the fact that if I did lose weight, that it would seem like I was doing it for him, and not myself. I am someone who places my partners worth to me solely on personality, and who they are, and a weight gain on their part would not phase me at all.

How do I reconcile the fact that my mother loves me unconditionally and her desire to spend time and talk to me is not based on my weight, but on her affection for me as a person, yet the partner I chose has conditions on his?

I would like to know if anyone else has gone through this. Have you also felt a complete numbness of emotion? Will this last permanently as I now have a very real insecurity that I have to protect myself from, or will it pass?

She is the love of my life and I am head over heels for her and I had plans to propose to her on an already booked Valentine's Day Vacation in the Caribbean. Over the last two years, I have treated her like a Queen, have been faithful, extremely generous with her - emotionally and financially, and have gone away on many vacations together and each one is better than the last one.  

Although we have our disagreements and fights like any other couple, I feel that over the last month and a half something has really changed in her behavior.  I have confronted her about it, but she keeps saying that she is fine.  

My girlfriend was married for several years and had a kid (that lives with her) with her soon to be ex-husband.  Although they have been separated for 2 1/2 years, obviously, they are still in touch and see each other constantly because that is what happens when kids are involved.  

She has always mentioned to me how much she hates him for all the cheating he did on her and for the way he treated her.

She kept repeating how she could never go back with him even for their kid's sake because of the kind of person he is and that their marriage would never work.  Its better to do it know while the kid is still young and won't suffer as much, she said.

I have always been a man who respects privacy and would have never done what I did this past weekend, had it not been because of of her recent change in behavior and a ""I just need to know"" desperate mentality. So yes, this weekend we went away and as guilty as I felt, I checked a text exchange that happened three weeks ago with her still husband.  Basically, he texted her telling her that he is still looking for answers on how to fix things for the three of them to be together.  She responded that she thinks often of him when she goes to sleep and told him about the things she misses about him.  She asked him about what he misses about her.  Last text in the exchange that day from her was ""I LOVE YOU, you two are the loves of my life"".

Well, needless to say, I have been devastated for the last few days.  I know I am stupid for not confronting her right away, but reality is that I think I have been in denial and have been letting my feelings for her overcome what is logical here.  I really feel bad I invaded her privacy, but I was able to find out what I was looking for.  

As hard as it was, for the rest of the weekend getaway, I put it in the back of my head, saying to myself, I always knew that she would go back to her husband.  I am such an idiot!

I think I know what I need to do, but I love this woman to death and although I can forgive, I am stuck right now in a situation where I can't live with her and can't live without her.   

I found odd that this weekend she talked about us moving in together and getting married, but obviously, the proposal plans for Valentine's week are out the window.  

What should I do, break up with her after I confront her and give her a chance to explain (even though I will have to come clean and tell her I invaded her privacy) or should I have a talk one more time and ask her what is really going on (and then confront her if I know she is lying)?

Either way, is a no win situation.  I am already devastated, I don't think we have a future together and I feel like I have been used for the past two years.  I have never loved anyone like I love her and I have no idea how to let go....",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_l9mam,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l9mam/i_found_a_text_exchange_between_my_girlfriend_and/,

Towards the end of last summer, she started ignoring texts, seemingly avoiding talking to me - claiming she was busy all the time. I thought something was up, turns out she's just terrible at long distance. Anyway it got ugly but when we went back to school and had a GREAT year. Then, this summer comes. At first it started out fine but lately there was a huge drop in responses to texts/calls and she just was acting differently.

I called her asking her watsup and she claimed that she wanted to take a ""break"" this summer. She said she has been with a boyfriend since high school and hasn't got a chance to enjoy just ""being herself and finding out who she really is."" She also claimed she was afraid our relationship was getting too serious too fast (which is weird because she was always the one to bring up kids/family, etc). 

I've talked to her on the phone since, haven't made up my mind what to do. I feel like if we take this break then she's gonna just end up using it as an excuse to do anything she wants and not feel guilty. I also feel like im still gonna be attached during this break and want to talk to her, but she said she would not want me to come down and see her because it would ""ruin the purpose."" I've even considered breaking up with her for good, because i want a girlfriend that can handle long distance and i definitely don't want an on/off relationship (she claims that she would work on her long distance but obviously she doesn't think that this summer would be good). Also i know that she definitely, definitely wants to get back with me in the fall and does not want to break up.

What should i do? Do these break things work? If so, how do we do this im just unclear on what happens? This has really gotten me down lately because its a little out of the blue and i love this girl, i don't want to break up with her, but i don't want to get my heart broken either. Thanks guys, i can clear anything up too just ask.

EDIT: I know she's not cheating on me now. Would she possibly go after other guys on a break? Well, on the phone i asked her basically that question and she just replied ""you don't trust me do you.""

1306856519.0,84,self.relationship_advice,hoaaw,Just don't get it. ,ToastieCrumbs,100,16,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hoaaw/just_dont_get_it/,"Guy I was supposed to marry. The one. Broke up with me two months. 

No real reason, just ended. 

Recieved a phone call from him, after I stopped contacting him. Since he broke up with me, I chose the path of not being a psycho or a stalker. And left him be. I felt that if he wanted to share a life together he would come back. 

Yesterday's phone call. He called to tell me that for the last two months he's been waiting for me to chase him. He wanted me to call/text/email something. I wouldn't. and I didn't. I told him I'm not that girl. I'm 26 with a life and to much to live for. I can't stop and beg someone to stick around. He lashed back with, all he wanted was to know I wanted him to be around. 

Now, I tried calling him. I tried crying to him three different times (right after the break up). He even came over and laid next to me in bed (his idea) without touching me, or even looking at me. His idea...he wanted to ""relax"". But couldn't be in a relationship with me at that time. Timing wasn't right. Blah blah blah. So the attempts I made to show him I cared...weren't enough. Apparently. 

He proceeds to tell me that I'm still on his mind as ""The One"". He wishes I would have showed him more effort. (I asked if he wanted me to be the badgering psycho to win him back...and he said yes. That freaks me out a wee bit.) He still loves me and wants to be there for me, and doesn't want to lose me all together. 

I gave him the ...eat your cake too line. Shut him up thankfully. 

Then I'm told that he started seeing someone 2 weeks ago. He's 29. She's 19. She has been his friend for two years. She looks prepubescent and she's the most innocent person I have ever met. We were friends. He's going to destroy her. I feel bad for her. 

Only because he called me yesterday to tell me all of these things. To tell me I didn't put enough effort into chasing him. How can someone say that? 

Does anyone think it's absurd that he broke up with me and then is telling me he wanted me back, but because I didn't chase him, he couldn't?

He also told me he moved on to her because he was Lamebook stalking me and saw that I was having a great time and it didn't look like I needed him. WHY IS THAT WEBSITE held in such regard? WHY IS IT IMPORTANT that I walked the fucking dog? How is it that my status provided you with so much information that you came to the conclusion, I moved on. Well I didn't. You're still stuck in my heart. And it's twisted. I'm not a psycho....at least I wasn't. 

I feel like he's turning me into a monster. 

Another tidbit on him: He's NEVER dated anyone outside of his work. He's worked with Petco for 11 yrs. And the only girls he's EVER picked up, hooked up, or dated have come out of there. Really? I know, I was one of the girls...I just don't get the games or his insecurities. 

Reddit, I know I babbled. This phone call happened yesterday. Help. 

Thanks.  

EDIT :: I'm adding a big ol' Thank you to the Reddit community. In all honesty, you have all been such a backbone for me to lean on. And a HUGE part of my stride to walk past him and not look back. I don't have a computer at home, so... as soon as I can get to a computer (that doesn't have lamebook blocked) he will be deleted. From everything. I don't want psycho in my life. and I'm thankful to know everyone that read this and that has heard the story has given me a lot of advice that all runs along the same stream. NOT ONE person has told me that he's good for me. I need to take the rose colored glasses and blinders off. This wasn't love.

Happy relationship, love each other very much. She has a lot of male friends, but I know most of them and I'm totally fine even if she goes out to party with any of them without me being present. Now, for a couple of months, she is regularly exchanging emails and what not with a guy who travels a lot around the world. I know about the letters, and once again, I have no words against it. I trust her. 

But today, all of a sudden, she told me that she'd like to have a ~10 days trip to the middle east with this guy (we live in Europe). At first, I was shocked, it felt very bad, and I must admit I was quite angry as well. We had a brief exchange of bitter words where I told her I'm not really happy with her decision. She kept bringing up that I wan't to lock her up, which is not true. The deal is, I don't know this person, and after all this I wouldn't even like to get him better. She also told me that she's very eager to travel, but since we can't get away whenever we'd like (I work, I'm limited to my vacation days, she is finishing her studies and has a lot of free time), she'd take any opportunity to see the world. I told her I'm fine with that but I think she should drop the idea to achieve those dreams with *another man*, if she cares about my feelings. Gosh, I'm still quite upset as I'm writing these lines.

It's not that I don't trust her. I don't trust the guy. I don't know who he is, I don't know his intentions. I understand her desires to see the world, but I don't understand why she can't wait for the opportunities to get to see unknown places together (her: ""It's just not the same""). We already traveled together quite a lot when it was managable.

Should I let her anyway? Maybe I'm selfish to tie her down? If I keep negative, I am afraid she'd think I'm limiting and chaining her down. Besides my grief when she goes away for a longer period with her friends, I'm never against any of her trips. But in my book, this is different. I am absolutely sure I'd feel really really miserable during those days she'd be away with another man. Not jut for missing her, as I miss her even when she's away for an hour, but now that feeling would be also undermined with a fear of losing her. She keeps reassuring my fear is completely irrational, but I just can't help it.

What should I do? 

**EDIT:** I forgot to mention that she invited me to come with them. Which is of course impossible, as I have an office job. I guess it was just a small gesture to assure me that her intentions are honest.

**EDIT2:** Quite a lot of responses, thank you! This helps me a lot.

In about a year since we are living together, this was one of the really rare occasions in our relationship that we went to bed without cuddling or kissing and saying ""I love you"" to each other. I felt (and still feel) deeply hurt and didn't want to, and since she wasn't initiating a good night kiss either, I just fell asleep. Before that, I've had another long talk with her. I've got more and more depressed about her decision, and it seems to me that she's absolutely unconcerned how much this hurts me (""This is an opportunity I don't want to miss""). When I asked more about the guy, she told me that I should meet him and get know him (frankly, I'm not too keen - I guess it's reasonable). She reassured me several times that the dude is totally honest and ""not the kind"". According to her, this is a great opportunity to her to see the middle east the way she never will be able to do again ever (the guy was already there, familiar with the place, can teach her a lot about it, etc). She even offered me to read their letter exchanges to realize that he's not interested in her at all. That, I declined. I wasn't in the mood to read their  lengthy email exchange and I also think that would be an intrusion into her privacy.

We've always had long-time plans together, and she keeps me making sure that she'd reject any advances from the guy, if there will be any at all (and citing her once again, the guy is ""not that kind""). That makes me a bit comforted, as I trust her greatly, she has rejected advances from other males while we were together, but it still won't take away my bitter feelings about this whole trip.

Now the money thing. I'm assuring you, she's not with me because of that reason. We don't have a lot of it, and we live quite modestly. I'm not yet the guy who could provide enormous amounts of it. When I asked how would she like to pay for the trip and told her it's not really fair that she'll pay from her student loans while she adds almost nothing to the households, she told me that she'll go and find a job and pay the trip from that if that's my main concern.

Last but not least. She asked me if my only problem is ""that her mate on the trip will be a male who I don't know too much?"". I said yes, that's my only problem (putting aside the fact that the middle east isn't the most peaceful place of the world at the moment, and I'd be constantly afraid for her safety while she's off). And that made me think a bit. I'd let her with a female or a mixed group almost without a word. So I guess there's a general mistrust from my side? I am not sure... She even offered to me to find a third person for the trip if that would make me feel better.

I'd like to find a solution with an outcome which will make happy both of us. Yet, if I'll keep up my negative stance and she misses the trip, she'll feel terrible for losing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Whilst, if she goes away, it will grind up every little piece inside of me. 

I really love her, I trust her deeply, but I can't express with words how sad and uncomfortable this whole idea of hers is making me.

**EDIT 3**: I'm not ""financing her lifestyle"". She never asked me for any money, ever. She has her student loans which she'll spend on the trip. When *I asked* her to move in with me, I knew she has no money at all. Told her that I don't mind, the only thing that matters is to be toghether. And she adds to the household whenever possible, even when not asked to do so. If she wouldn't live with me, she'd live in a dorm (which is free here as long as she's studying), and would spend her student loan on whatever she'd like. So sharing that money is actually a commitment from her side. She's not using me.

**EDIT 4**: She's quite naive when it comes to advances from men. She honestly never suspects more than a friendly relation until a guy ""moves to deeper territories"". It was always kind of hard to explain to her how most of men's mind ""work"". Quote: ""don't let that concern you, if someone makes a move on me, I simply say no"".

**EDIT 5**: She's really the most caring, loving person I've ever met in my life. She expresses her love in so many ways, some I can't even describe by words. She's my best friend with whom I share general interest, passion about life's several topic. As I see, she never tried to ""use me"", at least I have never felt like used. We have a great love life. We talk a lot, and even if we argue, we do it with great care about each others' feeling. This is really the first time in two years when I feel a bit dissapointed in her decision and arguments. I'm quite conservative when it comes to relationships and I simply can't get this thing down my throat too easily.

**EDIT 6**: One more quite important information I forgot to mention. She studies geography and travelling is her life. She's constantly on the move when she has the opportunity. Mind you again, she never asked me to cover any of her expences, and she lives with me solely because I insisted even though she told me she doesn't have money and she'd like to spend her student loan mostly on travelling. When I met her I already knew she's a travel freak and I was fine with that. My only concern is this unknown guy she'd take the trip with. Also, I am a little bit annoyed that I was faced with a definite decision. She never asked my opinion about this trip in advance, just suddenly, out of nowhere, told me ""I'm going on a 10 days trip with him""* (\*I'm off, deal with it).

**EDIT 7 (for those who missed my quite important answer to noonan's comment)**: 
We know each other for more than two years, we hung out in the same social circle before we got together, so I know her enough to tell that she's a person who's really always *just friend* with the males around her. She's not flirty but she has a bit of ""manish"" temper which results that the guys in our social circle consider her mostly as a ""little sister"". The guys who don't know her are a different story, though. They may misinterpret her bit navie, playful, overly friendly temper as an invitation to advancements.

That was fine, but I've noticed she's deleted wall posts her friends have made about us or me and I have to inbox her messages rather than post them on her wall. When we're out in public at parties and nightclubs we don't have photos taken together either.

I confronted her about it and her only excuse was that she's private. And that she doesn't want to ""advertise every detail of her life"" because ""people have talked about her before.""

Am I being totally unreasonable to demand more from her in knowing why? What shall I say to her?

**EDIT:** Here are some reasons I feel I  deserve a better explanation from her - the relationship status thing i can handle, not being able to post on her wall too, but the fact that she is deleting stuff about us thats on her wall, the thought that we can never have pictures together, the fact that i have tell my friends to tip toe around it and not make reference to us on her page and give them no reason are all inconvenient, curious and irritating.

**EDIT 2:** Can I just reinforce the point that it isn't about the relationship status but about these three things most importantly:

* When we're out together, and have had some photographs taken, perhaps by a friend of mine she would instantly untag them all if they feature us together as a couple. This is disheartening for me - and furthermore raises questions from the friend who has taken the photos.
* I can't post on her wall. If there is something I want to say - I have to question myself in terms of if it's contains too much romance to post publicly. 
* My friends have had posts on her wall deleted that refers to a boyfriend or a relationship. Explaining this is difficult and embarrassing. 

**EDIT 3** Well I confronted her about it using many of the points raised in here and it looks like we're breaking up. Fuck you reddit.

I don't think there's an answer, but here's a story and I feel it's necessary I get it off my chest finally.

Scenario: Me 19, her 19, few years back, we were together for just over 2 years.

Anyhow, we were at our apartment that we had JUST got, I couldn't afford it by myself so she was working to help, we made good money, we bought a car with good payments, I put it in her name because I recently purchased a boat in my name, trying to be fair. We had been given a van from her parents as a 2ndary vehicle, as I wrecked my only car (brakes went out)

So, the first week in the new place is awesome, except one thing, she's acting weird. So, one night I go to get on her computer, and it's locked, the password we usually have, is not it. I ask her what it is, she says ""here, let me type it in"" .. I said.. ""Why, what is it? did you change it?""... ""yeah, I did, just wanted something new, let me type it in..""... I was suspicious, so I said, ""No, what is it"".. she told me.. so I logged in, everything else seemed okay., then I unintentionally checked her e-mail as she usually e-mails her mom every day, (it came up by default saved log-in, I was actually going to mine) and it was empty. I asked her what happened to all the e-mails, she said ""Ohh, I thought I'd clean it up, had a lot of junk...""... even our saved pictures were gone... So I started worrying, I asked her, what's going on? She said ""nothing, why honey?""

I said, ""I just feel like there's something weird going on.. You're not going to leave me are you?""

she said: ""Of course not, I would never do that honey!""

So, I got off the computer and had her come sit on my lap and give me a hug and I asked her to look me in the eyes and tell me she'd never leave me (as reassurance for the prior suspicion...) she said:"" Honey, I love you with all my heart and I would never ever hurt you and I'm never going to leave you, you mean everything to me"" I smiled and hugged her and kissed her, and we went to bed. She (for the first time) initiated sex, and she did things she'd never done before, and I was amazed, and passed out right there after, comfortable once again with our relationship.

I woke up (at 2pm) to go to work, she had been off to work since 8... so.. I went to work, and about 4:30 it was reallllly slow and I decided to see how my mom was and I asked her how she was doing, and she said ""Fine, did you know (name) was out here getting some of the boxes you guys left out here?"" and I said.. ""no she's supposed to be at work""... so, I thought she got off early and was going to finish unpacking the left boxes at my parents house (where we previously resided) and so when I decided to give her a call, there was no answer.. I texted her and waited about 15 minutes.. no reply, I stepped outside, called her again (as I'm going to my car to go home and make sure she's okay because I started to worry and I wanted to surprise her anyway) .. I couldn't find my car, so I called her again, this time, phones off, straight to voice mail. My heart started pounding as hard as a jackhammer, and I started to bite my lip as it curled up, I thought to myself ""What did I do???? I hope she's okay!!!"" I hit the ""lock"" button on my clicker to try and find the car, nowhere in sight. I called my mom and she drove in quickly to pick me up. I drove to my apartment, the car was gone, the van was gone, the apartment was TRASHED and her stuff was all gone. 

On the fridge was a whiteboard written by her ""I love you sweetheart, don't worry, everything will be okay and I""ll never leave you!"" with hearts and xoxoxo...

She left.

It sank in, I nearly had heart failure. She took some of my stuff very obviously (my autographed posters by my friend Jim Sweet, he's an awesome artist btw).

I called her, voicemail.

For the next 4 days, I called her, voicemail. I didn't eat, or drink, I lost nearly 20lbs. 

No reply, til finally, she called... told me she left because she thought I was going to hurt her? I asked her how did she come to that conclusion, she said ""I don't know, I just did..."".. I asked her.. ""Have I ever raised my voice, have I ever hit you?"" she said ""no""... then why, I asked?

She said, I don't know, I just did.. We can't be together, I'm moving to (state) with my parents, and it's just not going to work.

I begged and pleaded, I didn't know what I had done wrong... 

we talked, on and off, and decided we weren't really broken up, so we tried reconciling and we had plans of her coming up for Christmas and seeing how things go... she had sent me provocative images/videos to my phone, for the time being. She had constantly texted me I love you, and I miss you... and I bought a plane ticket to meet her in some location to drive the rest of the way back with her... then, she started acting weird again, staying out super late, at parties, she never partied before,ever.. 

then.. I finally had enough and I told her to leave me alone, stop leading me on, and when she wanted to think of someone other than herself, to call, otherwise, fuck off. I never heard another word from her (this was over the course of 3 months that we were reconciling) and less than 5 months later, she had a baby with another man. that's 8 months.. it takes 9 months to make a baby (usually)...... can you do the math?

I was crushed, I was terrified to get into another relationship, it scared me...

How could someone do so much damage to one person? How could someone have such a cold soul/heart and stare one in the eye and tell them they love you and they'll never leave you, but do just that?

Those questions are to this day still un-answered for me.

She cheated. She lied. She betrayed, and she smiled the whole time.

I wish you other people in pain good luck, it's been almost 3 years since then, and I've moved on, I'm having a kid myself in Dec. and I'm very ecstatic, and love my girl more than anything. Things get better, its hard to trust at first, but do it.. its worth it.. the pain only lasts for so long.

Thanks for reading, if you read the entire thing anyhow.

I hope nobody else has to ever experience such a crushing blow to the heart, I missed a few details in there, but to this day I have no idea what I did to provoke her to cheat / leave me. 

tl;dr it's a story, why would I shorten it up, it ruins the plot.

EDIT: Thanks so much reddit, it's nice to know that strangers can actually have a heart! I appreciate all the nice comments (mostly). As for some of the comments, they want to know how she's doing now?

As far as I know, not so hot. SHortly after she had her baby, she lost the car that we got. They called me and asked if I wanted it, but I wasn't in a financial situation to do it, so I said no, it got repo'd. She's with a guy that in my eyes, isn't that attractive, but maybe he's a great gentleman, all the best to them. 

I hope nobody has to go through this, as I""m sure most of us have, but I wish it upon nobody. We're human, and this shit hurts!

As for the loss? Sure I lost what I listed, plus about 2500$ 2 weeks before she left, as I got inheritance money and paid off her hospital/credit card debt and left my own, as a gift to her. But, that's $2500. Money comes and goes, but you know what? I'm glad she left. I'm in a great place now, like I said above, I've got a new girl, she's so beautiful and wonderful to me, I've got a nice condo, a great job in the IT Field, 2 cars that run great! I've got a beautiful baby boy on the way, due in Dec. and things are just great. Karma has finally paid me back for the rough road I traveled through.

To those that think I'm being a baby, and need to just move on? You're right, and I did, I was just sharing my story with the rest of the reddit community. If you don't like it, don't bother reading it.

I'm a saver, he's a spender. I've been able to save myself a nice &amp; comfortable sum of money throughout the years whereas he spends most of what he earns, which is kind of understandable since he has more expenses than me, like rent. 8 months back, I lent him $1000. I was uneasy so I made him sign a contract and everything, stating he would pay me back $200 each month (no interest). After he paid off one month, he found out his financial aid got screwed up and it turns out he owed $9000 to his school. So, trying to be as understanding as possible, I told him to please just pay off the school first. 

Now he's working full time and earns a decent amount of money but I just don't feel like he's making any progress trying to save up money and pay me back. I know it's certainly not my place to micro-manage his spending, but I just feel disrespected when he tells me about buying expensive watches, or last night he asked me which color boots looked best (they were almost $400 WTF!). I have more money and I would never in a million years consider buying shoes that are more than $100... :(

It would make no difference to me whether he pays back the money now or later. I don't need it and it would just sit in my bank account. I just feel it's not right for him to be spending luxuries on himself when he owes me that sum of money. I try to gently remind him about the money he owes and he gets all defensive but assures me he will pay me back. So.. what should I do? Is it even my place to talk to him about his spending habits or should I just keep quiet?

--**UPDATE**--

Oh no, how did this make the top of relationship_advice. Hope no one sees this. Please.. downvote... for unvisibility.

So I confronted him about his spending habits and as expected, he did get really defensive. Tried to justify why he needs those $400 shoes because of the quality, etc (""They last for years"") He didn't buy them yet, but he was planning to. Then he tells me how he's saving up half of his paycheck every month and how he already has $3000 saved up... Kinda baffling why he couldn't just pay me back if he had that money saved up... So I bring that up and he promptly pays me back the amount he owes me. It ended with me feeling like the bad guy and him asking me ""Why are you causing these problems?"" So I feel like shit. I still feel like things are kinda sour between us. So now, his debt to me is cleared. It still doesn't change how different we are in managing money. So yeah, Reddit thank you so much guys for reaffirming that I'm not money-obsessed. This really gives me a lot to think about our future. From his spending habits, I've already decided that if we ever move in together or get married, we are keeping separate bank accounts to avoid more fights like this. And yup, lesson learned--I'm never lending out money to friends again. It is too much hassle, even with someone you trust and love so much.

Sorry if I don't get to answer any further questions in the next couple of hours, but I'll make sure to read your responses. Thanks.

Background, without giving away too much because he's also a redditor: we've been together since 2006, lived together since the beginning of last year, and last summer, I caught him sexting a woman he's never met. That really strained everything in our relationship, but we've been able to move past that. At least I thought so.

I'm terrible when it comes to checking his phone, especially after what happened last year. He also says we should be able to trust each other now, and that he's still a private person who doesn't like others to see what he texts to other people. Fair enough.

A couple of years ago, he told me (in the middle of our relationship) that his best friend's ex-girlfriend liked him. I appreciated him for telling me, but I knew I had to watch out for red flags because she's very flirty regardless of my boyfriend's status. My boyfriend and I had been long-distance for 4 years, and we've broken up once or twice during it... so I'm not sure if they did anything. I ask, he insists no.

Although she and him are in committed relationships, their texts are very revealing. She says ""I love you &lt;3"", he says the same thing back. But what made me feel absolutely sick to my stomach was when she said, ""I wish you were my first,"" and he said, ""I do, too."" (spoiler: we were each other's first). That's when I started to shake and lost my appetite. 

Reddit, what do I do? Do I come clean and approach him about it? Or do I ignore it? My only worries is that this is the second time I caught him doing something like this behind my back, and it'll all fall back on me. I'm really not sure what to do here.

**TL;DR** I'm in a committed relationship with a guy for 6 years, went on his phone while he wasn't looking, found out revealing messages with a girl that's in a relationship as well but liked him (still likes him?) saying they wish they were each other's first.

I didn't truly realize what a narcissist was until knowing one of my friends for a while. We hang out a lot and we always have a great time going out. Kevin's very much a people person and enjoys going out and I can shoot the shit with him a lot. At first everything was great, I slightly noticed he liked to brag quite a bit but everyone's got their thing right?? Since then I've been seeing more and more red flags like ""yea yea I used to be friends with so-and-so but then we butted heads and we're not friends anymore"" or ""I make best friends all the time but just for a little while"" and he tells me all these ways he manipulates people.

I like seeing the good in people, most of the time I'm friends with everyone even the people that are considered 'uncool'. But the more I see him put others down and I've seen him try to manipulate me a few times to get something that he wanted I'm having doubts of getting any closer to this person.

What are some social strategies to interact with a narcissistic person? They always seem to have the need to confirm they are awesome which tells me that they deep down don't feel like they do. But why do these people treat other people like trash if they feel like trash themselves? At the same time they're the most outgoing and usually the center of attention at parties or in groups. I don't want to stop being friends with narcissists, they are people too, but I'd like to find a way to control them when they're getting out of hand.

To begin, bedroom has been dead since our last daughter was born four years ago. I used to try and initiate sex but my wife continually had excuses. It was a trying time for us when our youngest daughter was born, as our oldest daughter got sick (and made a full recovery thankfully) and was hospitalized for nearly a month soon after the birth. I know this was hard on my wife as we had to visit a few hospitals in larger centres for care. (we live in Northern Ontario). It was hard on me too, but I made sure to be the rock for our family.

My wife started gaining weight after that, and eventually went on anti-depressants. She came off them a little bit later on my advice, when I recommended that she join a weight loss centre and a gym and do some things naturally to make herself feel better. I’ve always been supportive of her.

After two years of very little sex, I found myself not even trying to initiate any more, and that seemed to be okay with my wife. She always found a reason to not feel well, or to go to bed early, or to stay with the kids in their room when they woke in the middle of the night as ‘they needed her’. I talked to her about that not being good for the kids or our marriage but it fell on deaf ears.

Then I just quit coming to bed, finding things to do late at night and porn. We’ve maybe had sex 6 times in the last three years. Our lives got busier, and we barley spoke to each other at all other than being with the kids. We’ve always been very family oriented, we keep our kids busy and she really is a great mom.

Anyway, she has lost quite a bit of weight and I could tell she was feeling better about herself. It was around that time last year she started going on weekend trips with her girlfriends to Michigan (we live on a border town). I’ve always supported her in this knowing that she needed some time to herself too as she has been supportive of my activities.

In the last month, they’ve been to Michigan twice. This weekend is a holiday weekend coming up and I was looking forward to finally spending some time with my wife as we had nothing planned for a change. On Monday she tells me they are planning another trip to Michigan to celebrate on of her friend’s birthdays. All of a sudden my Spider Sense starts to tingle.

Her suitcase hasn’t even been unpacked yet since her first trip in April and my curiosity got the best of me and I looked through it yesterday. I was surprised to find lingerie, frilly panties and very sexy tops; things she never wears for me. Then I went through her drawers, I knew it was wrong but this didn’t sit well with me.

In her top drawer at the bottom I found some American cash she had stashed away. This was surprising too has we have never hid money from each other as far as I knew. I counted the money, nearly $700 and, a phone number on a piece of paper that wasn’t her handwriting. It was a mid-Michigan area code and google tells me it’s a cell phone number. I started to tremble, but I wrote the number down and put the piece of paper back in her drawer.

I Skyped the number so it would show up as ‘unknown number’, and of course a man picks up. I tell him it’s a wrong number.

Now things start to fall into place, of the time she has spent texting on her phone in the last two weeks (something she rarely does), quickly putting it away when I walk into the room. One time last week I came to bed, and she got up, went to the washroom for a bit and then went to sleep in the kids room with her phone.

So last night I tried to make excuses to see her phone at the kids baseball practice. I knew she had it with her, but she quickly told me she forgot it had home. Then I tell her when we get home I wanted to update the OS of our phones and she finally gives in. Again, I shouldn’t have, but I went though her text history quickly when she wasn’t around and it was blank – nothing there. This is a person that usually had 500 emails and texts saved on her phone because she doesn’t clear her inboxes. I sent a text to the number just asking if he was there and didn’t get a response back.

When I came back upstairs. She asked me if something was wrong. I told her I was upset about her going away again to Michigan. I wasn’t ready to tip my hand about what I knew yet.

I asked her if everything was okay with us. Ironically, we had a long talk. I never brought up what I knew about the lingerie or the phone number as I’m confused and want to keep the upper hand in this. It was the best talk we had in a long time and she told me how much she misses me and that we don’t spend enough time together and that we need more us time. She even asked me to go to bed to have sex. I stupidly did and it was the best sex we’ve had in a long time. I was angry and part of me was thinking that I’m going to gets some at least in case I’m kicking out the door next week.

I think she beginning to suspects that I may be on to her. So, this morning, getting ready to go to work, I took that number our of her drawer again and wrote ‘I know about this and I love you’ on it.
Really, I don’t know what to do next. Lingerie, a phone number, hidden money and trips out of town don’t prove anything, but things certainly don’t look good for her. I don’t know if she’s already cheated on me, or if she’s about to cheat on me and there’s still time to stop this.

My goal is to stay calm, and work this out logically, but my stomach is in butterflies. I would never have thought this could happen to us, people tell me all the time what a great couple we are. She always been a great mother, and this is totally out of character for her.
I don’t know if I just need to vent, or if I’m looking for advice, but thanks for listening.

She hesitates, clearly expecting me to answer. I say something like I love you and want to be with you, too &lt;-- which I've said many times.

But something was different.

Right after she was acting very happy and content and saying how she is glad we are on the same page and how she wants to spend the rest of our lives together (huh!!?

This morning I left before she was up, but she texts me again saying how happy she is to be with me, how she has never felt this way, how she wants to be with me forever, blah blah.

**Update**

Okay, so I have had some long talks with my wife over the past couple of days, and I've learned a few interesting things. First, she really feels like she needs to have a break from my sexual energy. What happens for her is that she sees me constantly coming at her, and when that happens, all she wants to do is retract further in order to be safe. Yeah, some of that is because of her childhood abuse issues. But some is also just a life stage thing - she's done having sex for procreation, and wants to discover her sexuality post-children and post-procreation. And, for whatever reason, she wants to do that first by herself.

After reading all of your great comments and advice, I think my best course of action is to get myself some ongoing support from a therapist of my own; and, I have also decided that because she can't give even a rough timeline of how long she'll need to have a break for, I am going to set my own time line. I am deciding to stop pursuing her physically for the next two weeks and I'll happily report back how that goes. I think I need to take control over the situation, and oddly, that means I need to be the one to say ""no sex"". My hope is that after two weeks of experiencing me not pursuing her, she'll actually get the space she needs, and will start coming to me for physical affection.

All this being said, I'm conscious that I'm not okay with a sexless marriage continuing for much longer, and so if this stretches into the summer, I'm going to have a straight talk with my wife about how I can start getting my sexual needs met elsewhere. Hopefully something could be worked out that allows us to stay together - maybe I get involved in kink activities, become an erotic massage model for training courses, take on a FWB, etc.. These things all seem pretty remote possibilities right now, but as I said, I'm not okay with this sexless marriage going on for much longer.

1361978105.0,82,self.relationship_advice,19bvwg,My mom hit my car backing out of the driveway and says I'm trying to rip her off by arguing with the insurance company,mymomhitmycar,98,16,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/19bvwg/my_mom_hit_my_car_backing_out_of_the_driveway_and/,"TL;DR my mom hit my car in the driveway about a month ago. She says I’m trying to rip HER off if I argue with the insurance company for a more money for my car (it was a write-off).


My mom didn’t want to go through the car insurance company and wanted to see how much it was to fix, because, just a couple dents can’t be that expensive. I went to a couple of places and they estimated $2000 to $3000 to fix. She started saying I should check out this random dent place that would pop them out, etc. The repair shops I got quotes from both said the crash bars in the door frames were damaged and the doors needed to be replaced. My lock mechanism also came out of where you put the key in the door and I had to disconnect and reconnect my battery to restart the alarm as it wouldn’t disarm.
About a week ago, I started to hear this scraping sound whenever I came to a stop. Took it in, and my brakes are gone, I need new calipers, and some other stuff. Guy assessed it $500 for an easy fix or $1000 to do it all properly. Great. Anyways, my deal and a separate issue altogether.
After all this running around (university and work ~20hours/week) I talked with her and said maybe we should just go through the insurance. She has a $300 deductible and then her insurance rates would increase 15-20% (she is already at a discount) or she can pay the amount of the claim by her next insurance payment. I felt like I couldn’t do anything without her permission, even when it was her accident as it’s my mom and I live with her. She was avoiding the issue for the past month and I’ve felt like I’ve been walking on eggshells. She really made me feel like it was my fault she hit me and would say things to guilt trip me and make me feel selfish for wanting to get my car fixed. My parents literally just got back a week ago from vacation in Mexico…she was just so mad at me about the whole thing.
I thought things were finally going to be sorted out. She would pay her deductible and I would go get my car assessed (which I was pretty sure would be a write-off, which is good for me since I don’t have to pay for new brakes).

I got my car assessed and the insurance company offered $2800. I think it's worth more and was going to argue for more (I would maybe get $3200 at most). She said she heard that my car got written off. I told what had happened and said I was going to try and argue for more money on the claim tomorrow. I said the car insurance company always tries to lowball you and rip you off and I would have to buy a decent replacement vehicle as I commute an hour and over 50km each way to school. Then she got pissed and said that I shouldn’t argue for more as I was trying to rip her off. She said the more I argue for the more I’m trying to rip her off. I said I didn’t really think of it that way and was just trying to get the right amount my car was worth, cause you know I'm a student. I said I was sorry if they were stressed about the house (they are trying to buy a new house) and was just thinking about me vs. car insurance company and not me vs. her. She said I only paid $2000 for the car and I’m ripping her off and its going to cost her so much money and that she is basically buying me a new car. She was just so angry and said my dad drove me down to get that car (probably $100 in gas). I said I’d pay back any money she thought I owed her if that’s what she wanted. I told her she was making it feel like it was my fault she hit my car. I am 22, live at home and pay everything except for rent and food. I honestly wasn’t thinking about her having to pay it and was just thinking I need to get a decent amount so I can get a decent car. I did get a good deal on my car. I did pay ~$500 for an electrical problem and $300 to fix my back windshield in the last few months when some random threw a rock at it one night when I was parked on the street. She just turned the whole thing into money, money, money. She was just so mad it was horrible. I feel like I’m an inconvenience to her life. I feel like I’m the bad guy and it’s all my fault. I don’t think I did anything wrong though? I’ve never felt close to her and its creating such a rift in any relationship we do have.
I feel like any way I go, she is going to have to pay money and will be mad at me. I don’t ask them for any money. I do live with them rent free and eat some of their food, which I am very grateful for. I hope to move out after I'm done my undergrad (only 1 more year!). I’m in the middle of this so feel I don’t have the best perspective. Am I being selfish? What would you do in this situation?

EDIT: UPDATE: First of all, thank you all for your replies and opinions. It really helps to put things in perspective. For some clarification, I live in Canada, more specifically BC. Everyone's car insurance is by one company, ICBC. I pay my own car insurance and my mom pays her own car insurance. I got some more clarification on the insurance. 

She has two options to pay off the claim. She can pay her collision deductible on her insurance, which is $300 and then her insurance rates increase by 5 ""steps"". Right now, she is at a 35% discount from the base rate. If she decided to go through with the deductible way, she would pay $300 now, and move up 5 steps from a 35% discount from base rate to a 10% discount from the base rate, increasing her insurance rate by 25%. Each year, you move down 1 step if you are accident free. It would take her 5 years to get back to the same insurance rates. The other option is she can pay off the claim directly. If ICBC gives me $2800, she has to pay $2800 by her insurance renewal date (Dec). If they gave me $3000, she has to pay $3000 by Dec. She said previously to me that she was going to go the deductible way, which is why I was so shocked when she got so angry that I was trying to rip her off. If she went the deductible way, it would cost her the same amount regardless of how much I got on my car. She failed to communicate to me that she wanted to pay it out directly and now that I understand she wanted to pay it out, I can see why she was upset. 

For clarification on the living situation, yes I am 22 and I live at home. I go to university full time and work two jobs ~20-25 hours per week. I don't have a loan for school. I pay all my tuition (around $3000 per semester plus books),  bought my own car, car insurance ($175 per month), $200 per month in gas to commute an hour to school and buy 1/3 or so of groceries. I am grateful for everything my parents have done for me and very grateful I can live with them while I finish school. I know a lot of people don't have that opportunity. I think I'm a lot more financially independent and financially responsible than a lot of students. I work my hardest to pay as much as I can on my own and come out debt free. I may not be completely independent yet, but I'm working on it. I think if you're going to school you can relate. 

Anyways, I reapproached the issue tonight and said I would forget the whole thing. I told her that I appreciated all she had done for me and wasn't trying to jip her out of money. I said thank you for letting me live her rent free the past few years. I explained that I thought she was going to go the deductible route, since that's what she had told me previously and that I thought arguing for more wouldn't change anything, but now realised that if she just paid it out it directly increases the amount she must pay. I told her I didn't want it to affect our relationship and I would just get the brakes fixed and forget the whole thing. My dad was there that time and heard about our fight and told her she was being ridiculous and it didn't matter what amount I paid for the car, it mattered how much I could sell it for if the accident had never happened, i.e. the market value of the car I had before she hit it. He said I should get a fair price in order to afford something to replace it with. He said $200 isn't that much in the grand scheme of things, less than $20/month. He said my brakes were going anyways and it would make sense just to take the offer. My mom agreed and that's that. My car will be written off and I have to get a new one (well new to me).

She's 22 and he's 21.  He is not an attractive man (according to her as well as me) AND he is very effeminate.  Not gay, but he acts effeminate.  

They've been friends for roughly two years, and about 6 months before she and I started dating, and claim they are BEST friends.  It makes sense.  They hang out quite often because they attend the same college.  Sometimes she passes out in his dorm.

Well this situation isn't ideal already.  It's odd that she's almost always hanging out with him.  She is very transparent in what she's doing with him, however.  She tells me all the time, we talk online and text while they hang out, etc, so it's not that big of a deal.  

However, she recently alerted me to the fact that she wants to take a Spring Break trip for her last year in college.  I made an assumption that it would be her and I, but she apparently wants it to be her and this guy.  Not me.  In fact, I'm not even welcome.  And she said if she brought up to him that I wanted to come, he would bitch and complain, saying it was their best friend alone time.  Because she and I are moving in together relatively soon, he claims I'll have her all to myself after this so he deserves time with her all to himself.

This is very fucked up.  I don't have a ""best friend"" as they call it.  I tried asking her if she would be OK with me going on a vacation with a female and she said of course not, but if she were my best friend then she would be OK with it.  ""That thing that will only ever be hypothetical?  Of course that's OK.""  That's how I see it.  

I don't see why him being her ""best friend"" changes the fact that he has a penis.  In fact, them spending so much time together is cause for alarm in and of itself.  Now they want to take a vacation alone together.  It seems like that should be a giant red flag.

I know each generation defines what is ""normal"" or ""acceptable"", but being raised by the previous generation makes me think that she should definitely not be going to a vacation spot with her MALE friend alone.  I mean if it were a GROUP of friends it would make sense, but alone time?  That's a couples activity, not a FRIEND activity.

Anyways, any input at all into this would be helpful.  I'm not sure how to feel about it at this point in time.

I (27 female) was recently informed that my boyfriend (28 male) of 2 years is planning on having his ex-girlfriend (who he dated for 6 or 7 years) move in with him. From what I was told, he has known about this for almost 2 weeks now and has yet had the balls to tell me. Today while I was at work he sent me a text saying ""we needed to have a little chat - and it's not going to be something you're going to be happy about but I'm sick of being broke"". We still have not had this conversation yet since I worked 12 hours today and really just want sleep right now, and definitely don't want to have this conversation anyway other then in person.. so he said we'll talk about it tomorrow.

 To add fuel to the fire, very early on in our relationship he actually cheated on me with this particular ex.. though he still denies it, I know there are pictures that exist of them making out that was taken while we were together. He has sworn up and down the past 2 years that this ex is nothing more then a really good friend (who supposedly has a boyfriend right now) and me not wanting to be the controlling girlfriend.. has sucked it up as best as I have been able to and kept my feelings (for the most part) to myself. But this.. this is a whole new level that I am 95% positive I cannot be comfortable with. So.. reddit.. what do I do? Am I wrong for considering ending it? He's one of the most stubborn people I've ever met and I know he will not back down from this decision, but I don't think I can live with him living with his ex-girlfriend.

Advice always greatly greatly appreciated.

**UPDATE** Wow.. never expected this many comments.. and this may be the first time in the history of reddit where every single person agrees to one answer. As one of you stated so greatly - I think I know what I need to do. I'm going to meet with him now.. bottle of wine in tow.. if you all are interested I will post an update to how it all goes down.

Now what?",wifecheated7yearsago,97,13,237,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/sm94u/married_20_years_wife_just_confessed_to_cheating/,"I've been married over twenty years, most of them good. We have two grown kids, out of the house. About seven years ago things were rocky, and at the time my wife confessed to having feelings for another man she had met online. She said she didn't feel loved by me, and really, I'm not a demonstrative guy, and I work a lot, so don't think I'm being one of those ""it's my fault"" guys, because I'm not -- I'm an only child and really am very independent and reserved. She said that she thought she had to decide between the two of us, and she decided to be with me. It hurt, but like I said, I'm pretty self-sufficient, and we got past it. 
  
Fast-forward seven years. I had pretty much forgotten about the whole thing. We've had good times, and I love her. She's out of town for an extended period. We were talking on the phone when she confessed that she hadn't told me the whole story seven years ago. While on a business trip back then, he traveled to meet her, and they had sex. She says that they really did break it off back then, and that I now know the whole story. Nothing has happened since, with him or anyone else. I believe her. She had been following the ""better to keep it to yourself and live with the guilt"" plan, but for whatever reason she gave that up and came clean.
  
I think there are really only two possible courses: divorce her, or forgive her. If I don't divorce her, anything else (like yelling at her, having my own affair, etc.) would just be hurting the woman I love.
  
I decided to forgive her. But she's still out of town. Not getting back for a few weeks yet. It's been a week since the confession, and I'm finding it harder and harder to live with my decision. Once I decide something I don't generally re-examine it, but I also generally don't fight my instincts. I don't want to divorce her. I really don't. At least, I hope I don't.
  
I'm stuck.
  
Advice?
  
tl;dr: married 20+ years, wife just confessed to a one-time affair about seven years ago. I don't want to divorce, but am finding it hard to forgive. What to do?

Edit 1: to add that it's been a week since the confession.

Edit 2: Going to bed now, back in five or six hours if anyone has anything to add. Thanks for all the advice.

Edit 3: I'm back.

Edit 4: Thanks for all the support and suggestions. I'm calling this for now. As long as I don't forget the account/password, I'll follow up with results after she gets back.

Again, thanks to everyone.
  
  
**Update a day later**
  
So I was planning to tough it out until she got back, and then have the serious conversation. This was because I figured the conversation would be tough for her, and I wanted it face to face in case something went wrong. Plus communication is stronger face to face.
  
That went out the window while we were on the phone earlier. She woke from a bad dream and while we were talking the conversation went to the affair and I couldn't stop it. So we had the serious talk now, over the phone. More background:
  
She had already confessed to having an emotional affair, at least partly because she didn't think I really loved her. Things had been very rough for us off and on back then, and we weren't as emotionally supportive of each other as we should have been. Nevertheless, she had decided to stay with me and the kids even though she was uncertain about our relationship. 
  
She had a trip scheduled, and apparently I made some smart-ass remark about her weight (she had gained a few pounds, but wasn't fat -- I probably didn't think anything of it, but I do have a smart mouth). She apparently asked me if that was really how I wanted to send her out of town, and apparently it was, because I did. She called him to come meet her on that trip. :-/ I don't even remember that trip, let alone what I said to her at the time.

She's not sure why she didn't leave then. It's been a long time, and her memory of it isn't all that clear either. They continued talking online though. She says that a few months later I said something about how I loved her and couldn't imagine being without her, and she realized that I meant it, and that's when things started to turn around. They've been improving (roughly) ever since. Somewhere in there she told him it wasn't going to continue, and they haven't spoken since. The relationship started on AOL (yeah, AOL, what of it? ;-) and she doesn't go there anymore, hasn't for years.
  
Back to now: she says she read an article that husbands whose wives die are happier than husbands whose wives have affairs, and that I'd be better without her. This was a good thing for me, because it made me realize that I do want to continue with her. Now I just have to talk her into it ;-) We talked for a few hours -- Viber is a great application for international calls, btw -- and I feel much better. I'm not sure she does. There was a lot of self-recrimination. I told her repeatedly that I'm the only person who can judge whether she's what I want, and I'm happier with her than without. She's smart and funny, and still way out of my league looks-wise.

So... I'm pretty sure we'll stay together. I'm pretty convinced it was just a one-time thing, and as long as we keep working at it, hopefully we won't ever be in a dark place like that again. For all of you who asked, yes, she was tested for STDs at the time. I'll still probably get tested the next time I go to the doctor. Counseling is likely in our future, but if we keep having conversations like today's until she gets back, I'm betting we'll be talked out by then. I'll hit the gym tomorrow and run until I feel better or puke, whichever comes first.

Again, thanks for being a sounding board. It really helped.

We have a really awesome relationship. We spend a lot of time together, make each other laugh, we understand each other at a really deep level, great sex life, etc. We're really upfront with each other. Pretty much best friends. Everything is awesome...except for this one thing. 

For example, if a guy asks ""Hey how'd you like that basketball game last night? Who did you go with?"" She would simply reply, ""It was good, I went with a friend of mine."" 

She recently has been visiting with an old friend of hers who has moved back into town. He is obviously interested, which she also acknowledges to me. She's shown me the texts they exchange and he casually drops in things like ""Hey beautiful"" and little stuff like that. Coincidentally, he visited her at work (hotel front desk) late the other evening around 1030pm. They casually chatted and he complimented her on her earrings that I bought her. Now, I would've seen this as a prime opportunity to say something like ""Thanks, my boyfriend got them for me at the beach.""  And this would have been easy enough to *not* make things awkward and let it be known that she is unavailable. Instead, she said ""Thanks, the *person who bought them for me* knows what I look good in."" I don't expect her to go shouting from the hills that she's taken, that would be ridiculous. But part of me sees it as disrespectful to not identify herself as my girlfriend. I am going to mention this to her, but I just wanted some thoughts on the matter. She goes home with ***ME*** and I know that is enough for some people, and I don't want to come off as insecure, but why wouldn't she let the people around her know that she has a boyfriend?

4. She invited me to a party, so I figure i'll find the right time, and pop the question then.
5. I want her more than anything.

I'm thinking about doing the whole ""could we be more than friends?"" thing, then telling her how I really feel, but due to my lack of experience, it's still nerveracking... Making the move by asking her to dinner/movie/etc. just seems weird, considering we recently did all that on the road, as friends.

After this post and reading everyones suggestions I sat down with him the next day and stated a lot of advice everyone gave. He thanked me for being polite and honest, and I did use the line 'Am I being unreasonable to ask a grown adult man to properly clean dishes, and do simple housework?'. When I phrased it that way I believe it clicked. He spent this weekend packing and sorting alone for our move and did a pretty good job.
I also told him he needed to continue to improve on his basic cleaning skills. I mentioned that although he works more, he should at least be doing SOME of the work and it needs to be done well. I have no problem doing most of it when I am working less ( I also mentioned the fact that I still cleaned and did things when I was working more than him). I also bought an app that lists to do tasks that we can check off and color code so he sees the workload I do vs him so he gains some perspective.

If this doesn't work I will start looking for a new place, because I can't spend the rest of my life fighting to clean a place when it's certainly not fun to do in the first place and it will only be worse if we have children. I told him he has 3 months to improve notably. I also said not everything has to be perfect but he needs show real effort. When we move to the new place it will be a real test of his organization and how he will do with cleaning the place we are moving out of will test his tenacity for cleanliness.

I wrote a letter to my ex, basically outlining how sorry I was for the way things transpired and my actions, and the steps I have taken to get sober and control my anger. I made it very clear that she didn't have to contact me, and gave it to her brother to deliver to her. I told her to make sure that she knew that she didn't even have to open or read it.

Well, she did read it, apparently. She didn't contact me yesterday, and I didn't expect her to. This morning, however, she called me; I can't even begin to describe how wonderful and scary and exciting it was to see her name on the caller ID. She asked if I wanted to get coffee (accidentally asked if I wanted to 'get a drink,' then took it back), and I accepted.

So I met her for coffee and, guys, she just looked so amazing and I wanted to kill myself for every hurting her. It was like our first date all over again: there were no awkward pauses, she laughed easily, and didn't seem nervous. She asked about my sobriety and anger management, and was so proud. She told me that I looked good (!) and healthy, and asked if I was seeing anybody and I told her I was trying to work on myself. She said that that was smart, and that she was also single, but didn't really say much about herself other than that. 

I kind of said something (jokingly but not) along the lines of ""well if you're ever out partying and can't drive, I'm always sober so just give me a call"" and she said that it would be nice to see me again. And I texted her twenty minutes ago saying that it was great seeing her today and she said that she agreed with a smiley face!

I'm not going to try and get back together with her, and I don't expect to. But hanging out with her and talking to her was the greatest hour of the past few months. If she does actually want to hang out or see me again, I will be ecstatic, but I don't *expect* her to. Of course I still have feelings (a lot of feelings) for her, but I care about her too much to try and make her uncomfortable. I don't know if I should wait for her to text me and see if I want to hang out, or if I should text her and see if she'd like to hang out or get a bite to eat first. She always told me that she hated it when she had to text a guy first, but I feel like the ball should be in her court at this point. Even if she doesn't actually want to see me again, it was the best day ever!

The accident happened 200 miles away as she was driving back to her job. I was told she was on life support and had died on Christmas Eve morning. The GF attended a gathering at her friend's parent's house that involved the mom and dad, and a few relatives. There was never a funeral or obituary. Way back when we first started dating, she told me about a cousin that had killed herself. She recently (2 months ago) told me she had not actually killed herself, but they had gotten into a fight and her cousin was ""dead to her"", but she wanted to own up to what she told me before.

So I had a weird vibe, called the ""dead friend's"" place of work, pretended to be a collection agency, and spoke with her.  I confronted the GF with this information, and now her story is that the friend's parents wanted her (the GF) to think she was dead so they would not have contact. And that her parents and family do weird things like that. She has been very adamant on wanting me to believe this.

I feel crazy just posting this, but is it crazy to even consider she's telling the truth? Should I just run for the hills at this point? My gut tells me she is creating a story to cover the facts that I currently know about the situation.  Any ideas on better finding the truth ?

2:30pm Follow up:  She said her friend called her and claimed that she wanted to start with a clean slate and enlisted her parents to help. If she is lying, it is getting pretty elaborate. And not easily checked up on.

**Jan 6 Follow Up** : After a few short conversations of where she tried to convince me of her ""truth"" and me simply stating that I cannot believe her story about the parents fake service, I told her that all though I still care about her, I could no longer see her with that in the back of my mind. And that the distrust most likely started after she admitted the one about her cousin.

About 15 minutes later, she told me (what I believe to be) the actual truth. That the friend and parents did not want her to contact the friend, and she told me and several others the friend died. And had to tell many other lies to back up the first one.

We had a heart to heart talk that this was a VERY serious issue, and it will seriously affect our relationship, to the point that my only role is to see that she continues to get professional help.

First of all I wanted to thank all of those who responded to my first post. There were a lot of different views I hadn't considered and I appreciate those taking the time to read and write back.


To begin with, I agree with those saying she's too young, and you're all right, she needs some growing up to do. The problem though, is even though she graduates from school this year (its a technical school) she would still be living with her parents until its time for her to get married. Not to generalize, but I find a lot in the Spanish community (I'm Spanish too) to have this mentality. There's no point in leaving your parents until you get married. So she's always going to have that sheltered view and never really go off on her own and grow in that way.


What ended up happening, I decided to tell her about the key issues I was having concerns about. I wrote her an email so that I could make sure I could say and word everything perfectly (I consider myself a pretty good writer). I brought up the wedding loans thing, the moving away, a couple other points. Showed it to two friends of mine so they could proof read and make sure I was being logical and rational.


Turns out she was completely offended. I apologized to her and let her know that wasn't my intention, that I really was just trying to convey to her how I was feeling, but she felt I had insulted her and her family. She wanted to talk about it in person, I argued that this could be done on the phone just as easily. She said ""this is too important to talk about on the phone and sometimes saying sorry is not enough."" I asked her if she could drive up to see me instead to talk about it, but she said she didn't have the money and I was the one who screwed up (by sending the email). 


At this point I was getting upset, I felt like me trying to share how I felt logically, so we could talk and perhaps come to a compromise on things with her was being thrown back as ""me screwing up"". I told her that I already apologized for the misunderstanding, but if she thought I was going to drive down to see her, to beg for her back, she was mistaken. She then stated ""well it doesnt look like this relationship is working out"", and I respond ""I'll let you know when I can get my stuff"".


Thats basically where it ended. Now it also occurred to me, that were this ""the one"", that perhaps I'd have the impulse to go ""chasing after the girl"". She really is the sweetest girl I have ever meet of all the girlfriends I've had. Extremely kind and caring, but all the shit that revolves around being with her, well I guess I was just getting tired of it. Taking a step back and looking at all the facts, I envisioned my future with her and everything that came with it and I'm honestly not sure if I would be happy with it all. Marriage is a huge commitment, and I don't think people should go into it with any doubts, which is why I let it get as far as us breaking up. 


So thats what happened, engaged to single in just a few days. I'll be taking the money I had saved up for the honey moon and start traveling again. My goal is Australia this September.

I'm a bit of a forever alone bachelor slob. I've been kept down for a few years because of my (recently diagnosed) bipolar depression.

In the last few weeks, I've decided to turn my life around and get my shit sorted out. I went to the doctor, and got started on lithium. I started exercising, cooking proper meals, and practicing piano again. A lot of these were just simple confidence building exercises, helping with self esteem.

Earlier this week, I started talking to this incredibly attractive nurse at work. I've been at this hospital for ~6mths now, and see her around, but this was the first time I had the balls to go and say hello. Chatting and flirting felt good :)

It seemed to me like she was flirting back. So with great balls of steel, I asked her if she'd like to come over for dinner. And she agreed :)

Over the next two days, she was incredibly distant, and when I tried to confirm dinner, she mentioned that she'd text me if she couldn't make it. I guess that's when I realised that she had decided she wasn't going to come.

And on the night, I got stood up.

I had a fun night with other friends, and got home feeling a bit disappointed. The lithium held me all together, and stopped things from spiraling out of control. Otherwise, I actually felt ok. That's something very surprising for me, considering the circumstances.

I realise that either I read her intentions incorrectly in the first place, or that some things about me just don't work for her. And that's fine :) This time I did everything right, and things just didn't pan out. Guess I'll just move on, and get on with life. 

I just wanted to share this with everyone. It's exciting for me that I'm not an emotional wreck right after being stood up. Lithium is a helluva drug. :)",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_en9e1,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/en9e1/just_wanted_to_share_a_little_story_about_myself/,

Soon after we first met, we were totally in love, I had never fallen for a girl quite as hard as I fell for her, she brought sunshine to my life in ways I never thought possible, etc.  About fourteen months ago she was attacked by some jackass on the street, physically assaulted and almost raped.  This, of course, was incredibly traumatic for her.  She's spent the past year in therapy, I make sure to talk to her on the phone whenever she's out alone to make her feel safe, and so on.  I've tried really hard to be supportive of her, but there are a couple things that have started wearing on me.

Before she was assaulted, we got along beautifully;  we enjoyed each other's company to the max, and we probably had two angry arguments in all of our relationship.  After the assault, she became extremely reactive and aggressive, lashing out at me when I proposed even the slightest hint of negativity or suggestion of something she might not like.  She's gotten much better about this, but it's still there, her personality has changed for the worse.  Whenever I bring it up to her she uses the assault as an excuse, starts screaming and crying and overreacting even more, and then she starts apologizing profusely, and basically spirals down into this emotional whirlwind that makes no sense.  It's impossible to talk to her about anything anymore.

And, on top of this, and I know this sounds incredibly selfish, but we have not had sex even once since the assault.  The first few times I tried to touch her since then, she started crying and curled up into a little clenched ball of tears that absolutely broke my heart.  But now, a year later, she still shrivels away whenever I try to make a move.

Fourteen months.  I have not had sex once.  I know it sounds selfish, I feel terrible even as I type this, but I'm a horny guy, I need to have sex.  And on top of this, I'm not getting any younger.  I wanted to marry her and have children and lead a normal life, but it's starting to seem like this won't ever happen.  I've asked professionals about it previously, and they always say to keep taking her to therapy and to give it time.  Well.  Time has passed.  It's been fourteen months.

I just got out of a long term relationship(3 1/2 years) a month ago and managed to meet a girl at my school during last semester. Btw, I'm 23, and she is 27. We are both in pretty much the same place in life, both finishing pre-requisites for entrance into nursing school. I totally fell for this girl and she fell for me. We click on so many levels, and when we're together it's just like everything has fallen into place.

We had been flirting over the course of the semester(talking for hours at night, finding nonsense reasons to be together), but I was never sure that she had felt the same way(thought maybe she was just being friendly). So for the most part it was just harmless flirting. After the semester ended, we actually hung out outside of school, and after our second date, we both confessed that we had feelings for each other. 

I feel great around her, and she feels great around me. We'd only gone as far as making out during all this, and most of the reason was me. My previous girlfriends had given it up really quickly, and it had kind of ruined the anticipation for me. So I told her I wanted to take it slow.

Anyway, a couple of nights ago, things got a little hot and heavy. We progressed to heavy petting, and other things. No genital/genital contact, but light manual stimulation on my part ensued. I stopped it at that. I honestly have never wanted anyone this bad. Everything seemed perfect.

Yesterday, she gave me a call and said she had to tell me something since she was ""falling"" for me, and her feelings would only get stronger as time progressed. Also that she saw how things were going and wouldn't feel right not telling me. 

So she tells me that she was with a guy 5 years ago(in college) that had herpes, and hadn't told her. So she has herpes. During this conversation, she was very distraught and worried at what I would think. I told her it was okay, and I just needed some time to think. I can't imagine how hard it would be to tell someone you cared for about this. I really respect that she told me, and that really means a lot. I just don't know what to do reddit. I know this shouldn't be such a big factor, but I'm conflicted. On one hand, I really like this girl, and I feel like we're perfect together. On the other hand, lets say we stay together for a while, and find out this isn't it. What if I get herpes?

I asked her about it, and she said she rarely gets outbreaks. She isn't on a viral supressive since she gets bad side effects. I'm also curious on how this would affect our sex life. I understand absolutely no sexual contact during an outbreak, and also probably no oral(on my part). Condoms are a no brainer, but I know that the virus can shed asymptomatically(without sores present). If anyone can offer some insight into this situation, or give me some advice, I would really appreciate it.

Tl;dr: Girl that I'm totally smitten with has herpes. Not sure what to do.

EDIT: Thanks for all of the great responses guys. I forgot to mention that she had one boyfriend after the herpes guy(3 1/2 year relationship) and he never caught it. I'm still thinking this situation over, but I think we'll continue to date and forgo the sexual stuff for the time being. Also, we can do stuff other than full blown intercourse. I just want to make sure I'm safe, and that we can communicate about this. I will keep this updated, and more responses are very appreciated.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_ch1ni,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ch1ni/potential_girlfriend_just_dropped_a_bomb_on_me/,

This is a very short version of my story as I have never been in such a hurry EVER, but here goes:

I started dating this boy who I will momentarily name Dog Face. Dog Face asked me to move to New Jersey with him about a month ago and after much debate and planning, I decided that it was something I wanted to do. I love Dog Face. For the last 2 weeks, Dog Face has been in Jersey. In that time I have built a nice bond with one of his friends, who I will name Broccoli. Broccoli and I are kinda tight — the kind of thing where we always end up chilling together at parties and such. Broccoli and I planned to go get Dog Face this weekend because we missed him terribly.

Well we got him nd it was awesome.... except not really. Like I said, Broccoli and I are close. That's why I picked the alias of Broccoli, because it has bro in it. We get each other and we look out for each other. Of course Dog Face has seniority in terms of bromance,  but this will be important later. 

So last night, to cap off our weekend, everyone was drunk. Just, like, teenager drunk. Dog Face and Broccoli decided to walk to 7-11. On their walk, Dog Face made Broccoli swear to secrecy. He then proceeded to tell Broccoli that he's been getting head from random women in Jersey. Broccoli was offended and told DF to stop that shit, because we're moving in together and I'm wife material. DF disagreed, saying something along the lines of, ""whatever happens happens"". DF then went on to say that he has herpes. Yeah, cool. I asked him if he was clean, like I ask all of my partners, and he said that he was clean. Broccoli asked if I knew and Dog Face told him that he ""implied it"". So, I'm being cheated on, and now I need to go get tested. Dog Face again swore Broccoli to secrecy. Dog Face then told Broccoli that if he told me, his ass would be kicked. Broccoli has bailed DF out of jail for assault and knows that everything that was said was serious.

But like I said,  we're bros. He told me. The thing is, I'm not supposed to know. I have already made all the arrangements to move to Jersey, including transferring schools and jobs. I don't want to go to Jersey with Dog Face. In fact, I never want sto see him again. I don't want him to think he's getting away with shit. Broccoli has made it very clear that he doesn't want to get ratted out, and I understand. Broccoli didn't choose to get involved. And he appreciates Dog Face as well as his ass remaining un-kicked. 

I have no idea what I'm doing. 

If anyone has any ideas how to tell him that I know without saying that it was Broccoli who told me, please enlighten me. I'd also like to know how to break up with him. I'm so angry that I'm shaking and I'm so scared that I feel sick. I know that I look like an idiot. Please don't remind me. I just really need advice. This is the ffirst thing I've ever posted on Reddit that actually needed a throwaway. Feels bad man. 

Tl;dr
My boyfriend is a lying nd disgusting sack of shit and I want to let him know I know without telling him dhow I know. 

.Sorry for typos. Mobile typing sucks. ): 

Edit: Broccoli does live close to me and I didn't consider that possibility. I don't think so, though, because Broccoli is about to be a father and loves his woman a bunch. I don't really know how to ask. Tomorrow is.  Milkshake Monday (it's a tradition among our group of friends) and Broccoli will be there. I'll have one of my other friends take note.

Also thank you.
 guys for the support. My test is scheduled for Monday and I'll keep you guys updated. I'm in the process of talking to Dog Face. I'll let you know how that goes, too.

1355150968.0,83,self.relationship_advice,14lsz7,Wife cheated. We have two kids. What should I do?,,108,25,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14lsz7/wife_cheated_we_have_two_kids_what_should_i_do/,"Ever since we had our first child in 2009, our relationship has been rocky. We've seen several different marriage counselors. Only one actually helped, but we ended up moving out of state. We've been under financial duress since I was laid off in early 2010. I found a decent job in mid-2011, but our savings has turned into debt. We had our second child early this year.

My wife suffers from depression and major thyroid problems. With the relationship being in such a bad state, I haven’t been really empathetic of her health or really engaged with her in the relationship. In the past year, my wife has been refusing to go to therapy with me. She claims that I’m a verbal abuser. I even went to treatment for it. After the initial interviews, I never received a call back to enter their program.

Since the move and financial issues, my wife and I have gotten out much, especially not with each other. I basically work, do housework, and take care of the kids. She’s a stay at home mom with a small craft business. Lately, she’s been trying to get out of her shell, joining some meet up groups to make friends. She joined one last week, and Saturday, she ended up sleeping with someone she met from the group.

Lately, I’ve been pretty concerned that this would happen because of the sudden exposure to singles, bars, and this scene in general. Last night, I checked my wife’s text messages because the paranoia was getting to me. I read some really suggestive things with several people, and I became upset. She confronted me about my upset, and I told her I read her texts, and I left the house.

As I was driving, I didn’t really understand what I had read, so I called and asked. She admitted to me that she had slept with someone Saturday afternoon, while I was out taking the kids to an event.

I honestly don’t know what to do right now. Last night, I drank for the first time in years. I don’t have a drinking problem—I’m Asian, and some of us don’t have an enzyme to break it down properly. Today, I’m at work, and I need to keep up a happy face. I feel like I’m not going to really make it.

**UPDATE**

I just wanted to let everyone know that I've been reading their comments, and I truly appreciate the time you've all taken to do so.

At any given moment, I'm feeling something different. However, I think, I'm going to try and help my wife with her mental illness issues for the interim. Some of you have mentioned that she has needs, too. And, although I think what she did was the most hurtful thing she could have done to me, I honestly don't think she went out of her way to make it happen; I think she got caught up in whatever was different, painful for herself even. She told me it wasn't fun, nor did it last long. With that said, I'm not just going to up and forgive her, either. With the precedent, I'm not sure what's stopping her from doing it again.

Counseling will be mandatory for her and us for me to even warm up to trusting her again. Of course, she's got her own trust issues since the relationship wasn't what it once was. But I'm a bit torn inside about all of it. With all the responsibilities there are to handle, it's easier to find contentment than it is happiness; I'm sure this isn't conducive to a healthy relationship, but what I want, and what I've wanted for a while now, is stability. With waves like this, it seems further than ever to achieve.

To those suggesting divorce. It isn't off the table. In fact, I had drawn up divorce papers with a lawyer back in August. We had an intense falling out after she accused me of raping her. Perhaps the divorce should never have been dissolved, but it was, and at the time we were hopeful.

Now, with her infidelity, I'm no longer going to accept bullshit anymore. I will speak my mind without fear of retaliation. Like someone else mentioned, this event caused a seismic shift in attitude; and I feel a bit more dead inside than I did before, but I don't see it as necessarily bad.

For now, I'm going to do what I need to do to take care of immediate needs. Where she and I end up will depend on her willingness to go to therapy, and whether or not I can truly get over this. Every once in a while it really gets to me. I went on her computer and found a picture of him on her meet up group. Personalizing the whole thing probably didn't make it any better, but it felt like something important at the time.

Lastly, I will ultimately do what needs to be done for the benefit of the kids. If it means putting a timeline on this relationship to steer in the right direction, I'll figure out what makes sense and let her know.

Again, thanks everyone.

My husband has a problem with my friend because of the negative things I mentioned, but above all else..... she just drops by.   Unannounced.  Frequently.   Normally at very inopportune times.

So, I get dressed and go out and talk to her for a half hour or so.   By that time, the kids are up.   And I had completely left my poor husband.... unsatisfied.  This is the second time it has happened in the last couple weeks and no joking at least 40-50 times in the last 10 years. 

So... my husband basically sent her an email telling her she MUST CALL BEFORE SHOWING UP AT OUR HOUSE.   And he told her exactly why.

I feel weird and awkward about the whole thing.   I know, in a way he is right, but.... she is one of my oldest friends, and we just have never been that ""formal"" with each other.    I am concerned that she is going to be offended and that this will change our relationship.  Plus, I am embarrassed that she now knows that she interrupts our sexy time.

She hasn't spoken to me since.,WhenIFuckUp,126,45,162,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/m8w1j/i_told_my_wife_her_weight_was_becoming_an_issue/,"Hi Rellit, 28m/24f here.  Dating for 5 years, married for 2 months and 2 days.

Throughout our relationship, My wife's weight has always been something of an issue -- she's gained maybe ~40-50 pounds since we started dating, and I've occasionally mentioned this and that I'd like us to improve on our health together.  I'm usually met with passive resistance and then acceptance, and we'll get into an exercise regime which will last a month or so, then one or both of us get lazy, and the regime falls apart.  Whenever I suggest we start it up again, or notice her eating unhealthy foods, I'll ask her about it, or remind her, and she'll defensively lash out at me.  It got to the point where I simply wasn't directly discussing it at all, for fear of her lashing out.  There was an occasion before the wedding that I mentioned it head-on, and she burst into tears, but eventually came around and agreed to work on it with me.  That lasted a short while, and it was the last time we ever seriously discussed it directly.

She made a personal goal to lose ~30 pounds for the wedding, but unfortunately came up about 20 pounds short.  Still, we celebrated her small personal victory, and I encouraged her all the way.  About three or four days ago, I casually mentioned that I was thinking about going back to the gym and asked her if she'd like to join me.  This turned into a defensive argument with her, where she accused me of having ulterior motives and thinking that she was fat and unattractive.  Ultimately I decided to stop ignoring the elephant in the room (no pun intended) and confront the issue directly: I told her that her weight was becoming an issue for me, and that I wanted her to want to do something about it.  She immediately shut off, and told me to leave her alone, and refused to speak to me.  She's interpreted my words as ""you think I'm fat and ugly"", and she goes out of her way to avoid me at all times.  She's called me selfish, cruel, shallow, and says I should have thought of this before we got married. She says that I've damaged her self-esteem irrepairably. She says she's considering a divorce.

That was three or four days ago.  She hasn't spoken to me since.  She waits for me to fall asleep before coming to bed.  I left her flowers by the bed last night while I waited in bed for her to come home -- she asked if that was my way of saying I'm sorry for calling her fat and ugly.  I tried to explain that I didn't think she was fat or ugly, only that her weight was starting to become an issue, and she shut down again, told me to leave her alone, and went to bed.  I persisted (this is a few days of not speaking, for god's sake), and explained my bit in full: her weight was starting to be an issue; I know that it hurts her to hear it, but I couldn't keep it inside.  I didn't think it was shallow, or selfish, or cruel -- I was being honest and communicative, and I wanted to talk to her about it openly.  Regardless of her weight, I'll always love her, but physical attraction is important, and if the problem persisted, it might become a serious issue in our marriage.  I explained all of this to her, and she burst into hysterics, fled to the bathroom, and cried for nearly an hour straight.  

I've asked her to come see a therapist with me sometime soon, and she's said ""you don't get to go see a therapist every time you fuck up.""  I'm not really sure how to react to that.  I don't feel I've fucked up -- I've tried to be open, honest, and communicative with her, and talk to her about this issue as politely as I can, but I'm being met with the worst kind of defensiveness and lashing out as a result.

She is in a stupid feud with her twin sister and when she found out that I was going to her nephew's wedding (my cousin, whom I have no issue with), she went crazy about how disloyal I was to her and how disrespectful I am to her feelings. I just don't want to see a family feud spread.

She is always like this and it isn't just with me. She even ruined my brothers engagement party by screaming at him for not coming straight home for a private family party immediately after popping the question. He just wanted to spend some time with his fiancé happy in the moment.

Every family event that is supposed to be happy always ends for me with a general sense of sadness. I have had enough.

I don't want to invite her to things anymore but feel badly excluding her as she is still my mother. My wife avoids her. Even my children, whom she has also been pretty heavy-handed with don't seem to want to spend time around her.

I don't know why she is like this. She had a tough childhood, but her attitude is ruining her relationship with her children and family. She is just so *bitter* about everything.

Obviously I need to speak with her about this, but I'm not sure what to say or how to say it in a way that will not make her defensive. Did I mention she has a trigger temper and is incredibly sensitive? Yeah, this won't be fun.

But I want to work things out, so please help me.

I've known that he's bi for a few months and I've been completely ok with it (I am too) and our relationship was really fun and interesting after that. 

When he told me he's gay, I was pretty devastated, but what am I going to do about it? It's not like I can change who he is. I was prepared to just end the relationship right then and there... but then he told me that he wants to continue the relationship because he loves me, he doesn't want to lose me, etc etc etc. What the fuck?? He told me that ""gender doesn't matter"", but... if it didn't... wouldn't he still be bi? 

I have absolutely no idea what to think, do, say, feel... I'm just extremely confused, and his suggestion didn't make anything better... what do I do now? I love him very much, but I don't see how a relationship between us is going to work if he seriously identifies as gay.

And, if you find this Julian.... hi.

Edit: Thanks so much you guys. You've helped me consider some other things that I hadn't thought of initially... I think I might have another conversation with him today just to clear things up completely because i don't like the way things ended last night and I just want him to be completely sure that I'll always be there for him if he ever needs me to be.

So, yesterday me and my GF, both in our late twenties, had a little fight over the fact that she keeps a lot of ""just friends"" males around.

She's very flirty with everyone and gives away all the interest signals even when she's not - she did that with me too... i'm pretty sharp when it comes to flirting and still I couldn't understand if she was really flirting with me or that was just the way she is (she had a boyfriend at the time). That ends up with her having a small army of ""just friends""... you know, those guys that always end up in the friend zone.

The fact is, she seems to be completely oblivious to the fact that those guys would jump her bones given the opportunities. She tells me she sees them as brothers and she tells them about her boyfriends (hurts, right? I've been there in my young years...) and such and so she thinks that, for this reason, they have well understood what's their place. 

When I tried to explain her how things really work, she flipped out: she told me that I'm just lying to her and the great relations she has with those guys go way beyond sexuality. 

Now, what I don't understand is how possible it is that a woman in her late twenties doesn't know about this kind of things: she seemed really sincere when talking about it but I really can't believe she's that oblivious. Maybe she's lying to me because she's got one in the sack already and she doesn't want me to interfere? I really don't know what to think... I'm not jealous of them, we both know we could cheat at any time if we wanted to, just the fact that she's so naive kind of bothers me.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_g2lcw,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/g2lcw/my_gf_doesnt_understand_the_dynamics_between/,

Okay, so a little backstory. I'll keep it short (pretty much because I don't really know shit). My girlfriend got out of a bad relationship a couple of years ago and all signs point to her last boyfriend being a total fucking asshole who raped her because he was a total fucking asshole.

So now she's obviously totally turned off sex (which I totally get). She doesn't know when she's going to be over it, and I definitely don't want to push her, so I've been backing off and jacking off (sorry, don't know why I'd choose now of all times to come up with rhymes (fuck, seriously?)). However, I don't know what I'm going to do in the long run, or if this relationship becomes any more serious (we've only been going out a couple of months).

Anyone on here have advice or past experiences to share? I'm guessing I'm going to be pretty much masturbating/crying alone in a bathroom stall 5-6 times a day for the next few months or years (i.e. effectively single).

And there's no way in hell I'm breaking up with her over this. Fuck everything about that shit. You're not going to ruin this one for me, dick.

This bothers me.  I've tried to talk to her about it but she says ""Oh so you don't want to talk to me? I don't know about you but I can't go all day without talking to you.""  

The texting thing bothers me because obviously I want to just relax sometimes and do things on my own.

This eventually turns into a fight about how we each have nothing to say.

Their main objection is that he is wheelchair bound. I have never been happier and I told them so, but they won't even meet him. This is made more difficult by the fact that we have always been in a LDR and my parents are partially putting me through college. My parents and I are in a cold war at the moment. With me saying I need more time to mull it over and my dad having said I would be dead to him if I continued...and my mom informing me...again...she could've aborted me. 


*  My parents have never made me happy. They always criticize me to ""make me better because they care about me""

* I am about to graduate soon. I would like to finish school but I don't know if I am able to get a student loan on such short notice.

* I am currently living with my parents for the break. I don't want to make things even more unbearable. 

*  I am the happiest I have ever been with my fiance. I love him dearly and have no problem with his wheelchair...giving him up is not an option. 

* I feel like I owe my parents. We came to the US together, I have been with them through thick and thin...I understand their concern, but not their reaction. I wish I didn't care about it so much, but I do.

* I have self worth issues, mainly due to my parents I'm beginning to think. I worry that I won't get a job out of college and will have to go crawling back to them or something.

I am not idealistic. I know it will be difficult to build a life from nothing with my fiance. But after going with the flow for so many years, of denying myself and hiding my sadness, I feel like I finally found someone worthwhile to risk it for. I just don't know how to do it right now. I feel like I should try to get through college first, but lack of funds...Also, what should I do about parents? I could pretend to go with them, but eventually they will find out...and be even more hurt...I am so emotionally exhausted. I could've kept it from them...i wish i did...I only told them out of respect but now I'm just so shattered....sorry about rant.

TL;DR Parents had been financially supporting me through college, but threaten to disown me if I continue relationship with love of my life who is in a wheelchair, a fact they cannot accept.

We picked a very quiet pitbull mix. He is a nice dog, doesn't have any aggression towards people or dogs. We taught him around 15 tricks the last 4 month and he plays fetch very well. The only problems are that he jumps on people when he is exited and pulls towards dogs/cats/squirrels when we walk him. I trained hard with him the past month and he is improving. He still jumps up on me or my partner when we left him alone for hours but he sits down when he sees a dog and is visibly trying not to charge towards them. 

My fiancee made it clear to me that he hates the dog. He hates that he sheds, he hates that I have less time for him, he hates that he has to walk the dog once a day (I do the same), he hates that he has to buy food for him (we take turns as well), he hates that he lays its head on his lab if he wants to play, he hates that he puts the toy on the bed, he hates when the dog tries to jump on the bed(I trained with him and he is only doing it if he is really exited or needs to be exercised). 

The last point was the reason I am writing this post. He was overly aggressive to our dog in the past but today following happened:
We left the dog alone for 4 hours and when we came back he needed to get a walk. It was my fiancees turn to go out with him but he said he is tired so he just laid down. The dog, still exited form our return, jumped on the bed and my fiancee lost patience once again and tried to push him with force. The dog hit against his crate and started bleeding a little on his head. 

I am strictly against his impulsive behavior and he did something like this in the past. That's why I wanted him to apologize. I can not tolerate this behavior. I don't want him to abuse the pet we adopted.

He says he can't apologize honestly because he does not care that he hurt the dog. He wants be to keep him away from him.


I am shocked. I thought of giving the dog away so our relationship would be great again, even though I wanted a dog all my life. The fact that shocks me is that he does not CARE that he hurt him. Holy fuck.
How should I marry a person so cruel? That does not care about the dog or my feelings of his behavior. I honestly think something is wrong with him. Should we go to a therapist and talk about this? It is not normal right? help...

He is always texting on his phone and hiding it, never leaves it out, which is odd for him. He used to charge it where ever and now it's always on him.

All I want is him to care again, say something nice, kiss me, and he's cold. Not cold, even worse. Cordial but distant. He's getting his accolades through his profession, everyone is saying how amazing and awesome he is, and his bitch wife wants him to put the kids to bed and help with laundry. I know I've taken him for granted, because I thought no matter what we'd be there for each other. I was a little worried about having a second child because I didn't feel like we were solid but then things seemed ok. 

What do I do? I feel insecure and needy, and I'm not usually any of those things.

Ok, fine. So HELP or stay out of it. Don't harp on me while you lay in bed. That's the definition of nagging, and yet, it only counts when I do it. When he does it, it's because he knows better and he's just trying to get it through my skull.

I lack so much confidence that even after REALLY heavy flirting she still had to ask me out instead of the other way around. I literally could not fathom in my head that this girl actually liked me even though I fancied her for the entire 8 months beforehand when we were friends.

She has basically had to initiate everything from asking me out, making plans for dates, hand holding, meeting her parents, first kiss etc. It doesn't help that neither of us have done this before - we were both each others first kiss, first BF/GF and at the moment we're both virgins.

A week ago she got rather drunk and talked about how it annoyed her that she has had to do everything by herself. She asked me if I liked her before she asked me out and I said yes but I thought I had absolutely no chance with her.

A few days ago I annoyed her even more:
We both live with our parents and we had spent the evening at my house eating the face off each other for a few hours. We were on the floor of my living room staring into each others eyes with one of my hands up the back of her top and the other running up and down her body. She asked ""Are you trying to be such a fucking tease or are you just this much of a dick?"" which confused my useless slow brain, so she sat on top of me and may as well have put a sign around her neck saying ""grab my boobs"" but I didn't. I don't really know why I didn't cause its not like she would've reacted badly. She then said ""You're too nice, that's the problem"". I proceeded to just look at her not knowing what to do.

After another 10 minutes or so of cuddling she decided she wanted to go, so I drove her home and she was quiet the whole way. I think she was fed up with my bullshitting around.

Basically what I want to know is what the hell I'm supposed to do next. How to overcome my lack of confidence and make her happy. There's not much we can do at our parents house but hers aren't at home a lot of the time.
What do I say during those awkward silent staring into each others eyes moments?
How can I compliment her without it being immensely cheesy?
I know what I need to do to please her I just need help in mustering up the balls to start it off.

Original Post TL;DR: partner goes out drinking fairly often even though we are broke and have a young baby; is this something we can fix even though its been going on a year now?

Well, surprise surprise, reddit was right. And the answer was no. We broke up in September so about nine months after that post when things just kept getting worse. Since we split he's averaging about once a month for a few hours of seeing the baby and drinking every night.

From what I hear, he has the shakes in the morning and he ""resigned"" from his job a few days ago. I imagine he was fired, but it's just a guess.

I'm trying my best to avoid contact except when necessary, though I'll admit I've lost my cool a few times and said some ugly things regarding his lack of presence in our daughter's life. He has been pretty much nonstop with the mean things he says to me and horrible things he says about our daughter. Interspersed with (my best guess) bouts of guilt where he asks if he can come over to mow the lawn or take out the trash, sometimes asking if he can come do that and then not actually showing up to do so and never bringing it back up.

Basically, it was long overdue and I wish I had listened even sooner. I'm giving it a year since the breakup to see if he steps up for our daughter (not to get back together, but just so she has her dad around) and if not I plan to move back home so my girl can be around my family. I can't imagine he's going to change before then, but I'm doing really well financially and really feel like I'm being a great mom too. Emotionally, ehh getting there! Anyway thanks for all the great advice.

TL;DR: we broke up, he couldn't be happier to be able to get drunk every day without my nagging him and my daughter and I have a great routine going.

Did you always want children or at some point in your teens/20s did you feel like my boyfriend is feeling?

Until that day comes, I’m supporting us both with my fast food job.  Wut do? There must be a better solution that just leaving and letting her become homeless and die.

I'm not sure how to phrase this, because I really want to stay anonymous here. Basically, there's something horribly wrong with how she perceives things.

She was fired from her last job for poor customer service. But she's convinced that she was fired because she was too good at her job, and her bosses thought she was a threat.

When I was in high school she tried (unsuccessfully) to get one of my English teachers fired, because I got 90% on a major essay. I was really fucking proud of that essay. That teacher was probably the best teacher I ever had in high school. I did well at English and always got marks above 95% in previous grades, but she really challenged me and gave me great feedback. Something I never got from my other teachers. When I tried to explain that, my mom didn't listen. She thought the teacher was unfairly marking me just to be a bitch.

Once she tried to return a couple skeins of wool to the craft store because she wanted a different colour. She had a little slip of paper saying that the colour she wanted was on reserve for her, but she didn't have the receipt. When the very apologetic cashier said there was nothing she could do, my mom got pissed. She left the slip of paper and the wool she was trying to return on the counter when she stormed off. By the time we got home, she'd decided that the cashier was ""completely evil” because ""she just ripped up that receipt in front of "" us and stole the wool so there would be no proof""

She was a housewife for nearly 20 years. I'm 19 years old now, and I'm financially supporting us both (barely. I earn $1500/month).  She isn’t on welfare anymore because they were “out to get her”.

I need to go to school so I can get out of fast food service. I can’t go to school and support us both. We’ve already been homeless before I gained full-time employment. If I just up and leave her I’m almost certain she’ll end up homeless and eventually dead, it’s come damn close to that before.

At the moment she’s working an an essay or sorts to send to the government, because apparently they’re responsible for all our hardship, and they’re going to give us a couple hundred thousand dollars when they read it.  I haven’t read this thing, and I don’t want to. I know it’s full of nothing but crazy. She’s been saying it will be finished “next week” for the past three years. In it’s very early forms, when I was still a minor, she yelled at me until I started crying and then video taped me crying, and made me say stuff like “the government is forcing me to go into foster care” and a bunch of other shit. She deleted it though, I think she must know that was a bit too far and would bring her criticism.

Sorry for the giant wall of text.

I’m not sure what to do. I feel like every day I go to my shitty workplace and not to school is wasted. I’m still young, but I need to go to something with my life, or some day I'll wake up and be 30 years old and still working for minimum wage and living with my mom.

Like title says, M(27) F(26) we have been together since high school, only dated some other people in college but pretty much stayed together.

We have 2 dogs together and have traveled to Europe, cruises and south america together.
I work from home and make pretty good money, enough to not worry. Got her a new iPhone for xmas and BMW for our anniversary (lease). I also paid for the majority of our expenses the last years together bc she was going to nursing school and couldn't work. Which i help pay for her nursing school. 
She comes from a not so well off family, while my family is upper middle class. i think she always liked that i had money but i never wanted to think of it that way. 

Anyway, in mid December she started working at a new hospital ER for 12 hour shifts at night. as soon as she started working there, i noticed she was texting this one guy very often, lets call him K. they would be texting like high schoolers and playing games on the iPhone, even though they saw each other for 12 hours a shift, He is her Preceptor.
I told her in a nice way that this made me uncomfortable and if anything i would at least like to meet the guy to avoid any future problems.
She tells me not worry about K bc he is her boss and his wife also works with them and is about to have a baby. So i think OK..but still slow down on the texting a little bit. she agrees. 
After a week i notice she never leaves her phone unattended anymore, guards it like mother falcon! But one day my curiosity got the better of me and i checked her phone when a message came in( she was sleeping)  it was him, telling her to ""bring spare change of clothe"" he had also texted her ""goodnight :)"" and ""your such a bad liar"" 

I went to walk the dogs and when i got back she had deleted the texts and many more, so i wake her up to talk to her about it. she says im overreacting and freaks out, says she does not want to be with somebody who can tell her she cant have guy friends?? i dont have a problem with her having guy friends just not guys that are flirting with her and texting her 24/7 and she said she was only deleting them so i wouldn't get upset...?

I tell her to stop all contact with this guy who clearly more than her friend. she says no because she just started this job and doesn't want to start drama there.

the fight escalates and we break up because she could not and did not want to stop talking to her new friend.

after 10 years she picks him over me.

fast forward 2 months:
-he was never married
-doesn't even live with the mother of his baby/ some girl he knockedup
-the mother of his child wrote her a nasty message telling her to stay away from K. this is after we broke up
-shes already dating another guy different from K, they have gone out to 2 dinners and have gone running together. i would always ask her to go running but she said no.
-she blocked me from her phone and fb, for no reason one day she just cut, the day before she was asking me out to dinner. 
-im still telling her i love her like a fucking loser
- i feel like alien is coming out of my chest

I just needed to get this off my shoulders, i just recently started therapy and i feel like its working but i have been meaning to do this for a while.
if she came back should i give her a chance, how do get over this shit, im already hitting gym but dont have many friends to go out with.
i feel really shitty right now.

EDIT: what hurts the most is that shes already dating so soon, after 10 years! it rips my heart out.
the therapy is helping im also taking flying lessons, but its still so hard to get her off my mind, i think abouther going out to eat with her new man and it kills me.

EDIT: Her main problem with me is that i smoke some trees ever now and again, she hated it. so i respected that, sometimes i would while listening to vinyl or when riding bicycles in Holland ( where she tried it and ate a whole pizza after) or when hanging out with some old college buddies. Ive tried not to since the split to avoid over thinking about her. but when i caught her deleting the texts she said it was just as bad as me smoking. 

Being deceitful with another man=Smoking occasionally???

Also forgot to mention that on new years eve she went to have a mimosa with him after work...at 8am, said it was gonna be a group of people, but they all ended up cancelling and was just them 2. while i was at home making her breakfast and waiting on her...

EDIT: thanks everyone for your words of encouragement 
today im gonna try not to think about it.
 
Someone asked me if she had kept the ring, yes she did. i asked for back it but she never gave it back.

1274802366.0,76,self.relationship_advice,c7y79,I'm an introvert. How can I meet chicks without pretending to be an extrovert?,edmond_dantes,116,40,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c7y79/im_an_introvert_how_can_i_meet_chicks_without/,"Yo reddit. I'm an introvert. I like doing solitary things a lot of the time.

However I'm not rude, shy or socially backward. When I'm around other people (say at a party) I'm pretty good fun (I think). And I have fun.

But I only like this in very very small doses. Most of the time I like to be by myself. I spend lots of time reading books, drawing, programming, etc, and am contented this way. When I do do social things, it's invariably with a small circle of close friends. I do not have trouble making friends, I just have all the friends I want.

The trouble is, when you live this way, you don't get any sex. I had no girlfriend until 25, so when I hit that age, I changed my life, as an experiment. I started saying yes to any social invitations, attending dancing lessons, dressing up and hitting the clubs every Saturday night. And sure enough, I hooked up with a couple of girls.

The trouble was, all this social activity meant I was bored out of my fucking tree. I hated meeting new people all the time. I find dancing inane. So I stopped. I thought the more I did social things the more I would enjoy it but I just didn't. It all seemed like a massive effort.

Now I'm back to my old habits. But I want some sex. However I refuse to pretend to be some social gadfly.

But how the hell am I meant to get any action?

I've considered the following:

* Fapping: Not the same. Real sex is better. Plus, a long term relationship (with the right girl) would be great.

* Making a lot of money: I'm content as I am. I have set myself up with a non-demanding job so I can spend time doing the stuff I enjoy. I am not going to become Captain Workaholic just so I can buy flash cars and score a trophy wife.

* Meeting girls at work or through work colleagues: I work in the computer field. It's a friendly workplace but there is only one female in my age group. She is not single and has no female friends.

* Online dating: Have reviewed sites in my area for potential hook-ups. I live in a fairly remote area, so there are very few potential candidates and none of them seemed at all appealing judging by their profiles.

* Prostitution: Am not interested in sex without any emotional connection.

So what the fuck am I meant to do? I'm pretty damned sexually frustrated here, people.

tl;dr: I don't like to go out much and so don't meet any chicks. What's the solution?

**EDIT: Thanks for the suggestions everybody. Overall the advice seems to be that I should to try some activities (art classes, book groups etc) which are more social yet still cater to the introvert. I will follow your advice. Thanks reddit.**

In case anyone else has problems like this, I thought I'd share my experience.

Let's say I'm upset for whatever reason.  Maybe I feel overwhelmed by work, or I'm worried about global warming, or just mad because we're out of cereal.  I probably won't even mention anything about it because I know, from experience, nothing my boyfriend will say will help,  but unfortunately I can't hide my feelings very well and I'll probably sigh or something.  My considerate boyfriend, hearing the sigh, will ask ""What's wrong?"".  I'll tell him, and he'll listen and then respond with the worst fucking response possible:

""Hmmmmmm.""

WTF!  Boyfriend, you can't just say ""hmm""!  I just shared some personal feelings with you, now you've got to respond!  This is why I didn't want to bring it up in the first place.  Trying to communicate this, I'll ask ""So what do you think?""

""Well, I don't know what to say.""

Argh!  It's bad enough when I'm only suspecting that you don't know how to comfort me, it's worse when you confirm it.  By now I may be visibly disappointed, so boyfriend tries to make it all better.

""I love you.""

Okay, that's very nice.  I get that you're trying.  But these are not the magic words that I need to hear.  No, the correct answer was:

**""Gee honey, that sucks!""**

That's it.  That's 90% of what I need from you.  The other 10% is a hug.

Basically, when I'm upset for whatever reason, what I crave is validation for that feeling.  I want to know that I have good reason to feel the way I do.  I want to know that you don't think I'm just being a whiny bitch, but rather that my emotions are totally justified and in fact, you'd be upset too.

It's completely possible that you do think I'm being a whiny bitch, and in certain circumstances, I may need to hear that so I can get some proper perspective.  But if I have a genuine problem, or you'd just like to avoid drama, just tell me, ""Yes, that is awful.  Poor you.  I understand why you feel the way you do.""

Note that this is also why advice is the incorrect response.  Sometimes I am looking for advice, but even then I still want to get your recognition that I've got a real problem.  Otherwise, the advice comes with the extra subtext that the problem is pretty much my fault anyway since I couldn't think of any of these solutions myself.

This is also why PMS is such a fucking minefield, because I will feel completely shitty for NO reason, but I still crave the recognition that my problems are real, even though they are completely non-existent.  But really, if I'm crying about those damn fuckers at Price Chopper for silently judging my choice of Doritos, it still pays to say ""Oh, I'm so sorry that happened, they are all bitches"" rather than ""Hmm, I don't know, maybe you are being sensitive.""  Really, it takes so little to make me feel better, does it bother you if its a lie?

Basically, it's come to light recently that my dad is being accused of sexual assault on two minors. He's admitted to one of them and says he doesn't remember the other but says that ""if they say I did it, then I must"". 

There's a chance that this could be in the news within the next year and that he may even go to jail. If he doesn't go to jail, I don't want him to not be able to hold his own grandchildren (who me and my gf are planning on having in the not so distant future) because their mother thinks he's a pedophile.

Now any reasonable person would probably be thinking ""Damn right, he *is* a pedophile."" at this stage but let me say that the *incident* happened over 30 years ago and these people are only coming out to the police now and my dad's been a recovering alcoholic for over ten years. 

I've never believed that a man who touches a young child in a way they don't understand should be forgiven but that isn't my father. He's a different man today. He made bad choices a long time ago fuelled by drink and now, the way I see it, he'll be held accountable for another man's actions (not literally but hopefully you understand my sentiment). Is this just family-based bias? Could my gf see it that way? Does anyone else here think it *could* be seen that way? He makes no denial he did it and is remorseful. He's brought a lot of shame on the family and knows he must be brought to justice. But does my gf need to know?

This is tearing me up and I don't even know if here is where I should be posting. I just haven't told a soul about this and just need to hear some advice.

______________________________________________________________________________________________

**Update:** The response has been fairly unanimous; I should tell my girlfriend that my father is an admitted child molester. Having only found this out myself a few days ago, I'm going to let it settle in my own head, figure out what to say and how to say it before I actually do. I'm going to give it a few days but I will tell her. 

I just want to say thanks to everyone who responded. I already knew I should tell her, I always knew it. I just needed to hear it from you guys to actually convince me to do it. Thank you for this and for all the support you showed a guy who didn't know where to go and hoped that here could help. It did. Thanks.

**Update No.2:** She has been told. She is being very supportive to me. Thanks again everybody.

**Update No.3:** Despite the fact my world got turned upside down a few days ago with this news, a lot of you seem to think that telling me not to have kids is the best form of advice.

Her parents dont know and she still lives with them. they started talking when she was 17. 

It was iffy and I'm not fond of him since he's controlling and often tells her not to wear certain things or talk to certain people. He does things like read all her Facebook conversations and Skype conversations and deletes people he doesn't like. Forbids her to wear tank tops or anything other than T-shirts. She can't wear shorts, because ""he doesn't want other guys looking at her."" She buys him expensive gifts and he doesn't even have a job and he lives with his parents so she pays for everything.

 She told me yesterday that his real age is 38 and soon to be 39. I don't feel comfortable with him coming over to my house or parties or group outings to my ranch and such. Is it unreasonable to ask her to leave him home or am I over reacting? How do I go about talking to her about this?


Edit: I don't want to exclude him from everything. Just things that I host.

1355477976.0,76,self.relationship_advice,14u4gh,My best friend of 10 yrs decided to get back together with the boyfriend who abused us both. He recently found out where she worked and walked in homeless and on probation asking her for help. Convicted for beating his ex wife. I am losing my best friend of 10 years!! Please talk to me.,Sugarplague,96,20,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14u4gh/my_best_friend_of_10_yrs_decided_to_get_back/,"To backtrack, he was OUR boyfriend. I started dating him while she was on tour with her band. I at the time wasn’t sure where he and I were going. When she got back from tour he told me they were just friends. Turns out they had dated for almost three years. 

Let me backtrack more. When my friend “Jane Doe” was 18 she moved into a house with him, his sister, and his girlfriend. Yeah that’s right, his girlfriend. Even though Jane Doe was sleeping with this guy she was too young to know any better. He was physically and emotionally abusive to both her and the girlfriend. Jane Doe eventually wised up and moved out, after almost two years. 

A year after that she started casually sleeping with this guy again. Then she went on tour. Two months later she came back and here I was, living in his house, being his girlfriend. She tried to hide the fact that she was hurt. Roll with the punches. She’d done it before.  She and I became friends. 

Then one night, a few months into it we all got drunk and he slept with her. I am not the kind of person who much cared at that time. We weren’t married and I had the idea that it might be okay even though it hurt my feelings a little. 

Did I mention he is an alcoholic? Not just any alcoholic, but three Steel Reserves a day, plus a half a fifth of Whiskey kind of alcoholic.  At first we all got drunk together. We had a blast. I was his girlfriend. Another month passed. I was in love with him. Bad, obsessive and unhealthy in fucking love. 

He abused us both. We both loved him. We loved each other more because we were suffering together. It bonded us in a very serious way. We all eventually lived together. NOT in the same room. This wasn’t too much like that, though we had a few moments.  Jane Doe and I were best friends. We have talked almost every day for the last 10 years. 

I don’t hesitate to mention that in some ways he was amazing. He taught me to play Viola, and her to play Cello. There was a love of art and music mixed up in all of this. I was with him for two years. There were too many moments to describe that were horrible. He beat me up while I was pregnant with his child which I lost. He never cared. I now know enough about psychology that he is a textbook narcissist, the personality disorder.

 When I left him I moved in with her (roommates). She knew him, and she convinced me to leave. We were fucking free! I got married eventually and had a son. I am way happy with my life choices. She never was able to find that, though she has an excellent job and has accomplished a lot. 

Two years ago he moved to NYC and got married. He was convicted for beating up his new wife and she currently has a restraining order against him. He came back and beat up another girl he started dating. He has been homeless and living in a half-way house with 500 other men for close to a year. He found out where “Jane Doe” works and started coming in. She started dating him again for some reason. Obviously it is ruining our friendship. 

I told her I couldn’t be a part of her life if she was going to try to have a serious relationship with him. She and I talk every day, about everything. She is like a sister. It’s like asking someone to sit down to dinner with their rapist. I cannot accept him. I want her to be happy, but I certainly don’t want to hear about him being happy. How they enjoyed good food, or saw a good movie. It makes me sick. He doesn’t deserve her.  I can’t be a good friend and go along with her decision. Help me please. I need advice. She is pissed that I am giving her an ultimatum. I cannot help it. This is crazy!

1331913498.0,80,self.relationship_advice,qziat,Boyfriend blames me for needing to find an apartment because I'm not ready to let him move into my house. Could use some advice. ,peapodpixie,87,7,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/qziat/boyfriend_blames_me_for_needing_to_find_an/,"Hey all. I'm a 23 year old woman who has been dating a 24 year old man- let's call him Jake- for about 6 months. I'm also a frequent redditor, but this is a new account I've made just for this question.

Three months into dating, the place Jake was living was being sold by the owners and he had to leave. To be supportive, I offered up my apartment to him.  For me, 3 months was way too early to move in together, but I wanted to be there for him. I told him to stay as long as he wanted, but I thought he would look into other places while he was living with me. He didn't. Slowly, one closet became his, a second litter box to accommodate his cat was crammed under a shelf, and we bought new mattresses and a bigger bed frame so both of us would have a place to sleep. 3 months seemed too early for all this, but he was a sweet, kind guy, so I just went with it. 

About a month ago, I had an unexpected stroke of good luck. My 94 year old grandfather, who I am very close to and lived with/helped out during college, made a decision to move to a retirement community. He wanted me to have his house. We made a deal and at the end of summer I will be moving into a beautiful old house that I am getting for dirt cheap (love you, grandpa). 

Being roommates with Jake, where we were mutually responsible for a crappy little apartment, seemed like a pretty normal thing to do. But now that I am becoming a first-time homeowner, I'm really not ready to share my house with a boyfriend who I've only been dating for six months. I move at a slower pace than that, and it just seemed a bit too much, too soon for me. 

I was honest with Jake about how I felt. I explained to him that I wouldn't be leaving the apartment until my lease is up at the end of  August, which gave him 7 whole months to look around and find a place of his own. I apologized for not being ready to live in a house together, apologized for the inconvenience, and told him that I would help out in any way I could.

I knew he'd be upset, but I didn't expect how bad it would be. He asked me not to take the house so we could keep living together in the apartment, he blamed me for not having anywhere to go, and he blamed me for upsetting and depressing him by forcing him to move out. He told me that if he couldn't find a place to afford on his own, he would have to leave me and move back to his family three states away, and he indirectly blamed me for that. I apologized for all of these things, and I told him I'd help him look for a new place. He told me he didn't want my help because I'd just be condescending. 

A month has passed since then and Jake won't discuss the subject with me. We are still living together, and when I ask him how his apartment search is going or whether he needs help, he refuses to talk about it. All he says is that he still hasn't found anything and it doesn't look good, and then asks me to stop talking about it because it upsets him. When this isn't on his mind, however, he continues to be a good, kind boyfriend, if a little moody.

I know how frustrated and worried Jake is right now. I'm trying to be understanding about it, and I'm trying my best to make him feel better. But the way he is treating me through this situation is making me seriously question whether I should just break up with him now. 

Jake has always treated this relationship like the be-all, end-all of his existence. He is absolutely in love with me and I don't want to hurt him because he really is a sweet guy. I love him too, but being with someone who I can't even speak to about the important things in our life is not where I want to be at 23 years old! 

I am stuck on what to do. I don't know whether to break up with him now, continue putting a lot of one-sided effort into resolving our issues, or just throw my hands up in the air and wait to see what he chooses to do. I don't even know if I'm being reasonable or if I'm taking all this way too seriously. What do you think?

Also, thanks for listening.

EDIT: I'd like to thank everyone for all of the advice, as well as the general encouragement to not blame myself for things that are not my fault. After a serious talk, Jake and I agreed to make a greater effort at communicating with each other. While there was some improvement, it was kind of too little, too late to save the relationship. We've now broken up, and I'm already beginning to think it was the right choice. Again, thanks guys, for sharing. Have an awesome day, Reddit.

I have a full time job and a second part-time one. During the entire time we've been together he's been ""looking for work"", earning some money every month but no more than $500 or so.  I pay the bills, so I know that many of them don't get paid every month, and that there are a lot of things that are on the back burner, meanwhile accruing extra fees.  We don't take any vacations or do anything together because we just can't afford it.  We've got no savings and I have to pinch ever penny including on things the kids need, like shoes and clothes.

I love him, I really do. He's a sweet man for the most part and a caring father but I just hate him right now.  He does some of the house work, but I wouldn't even say half. It embarrasses me that I have to work so hard while he fucks around ""looking"", not bothering to send out any resume's or increase his skills, or anything that would help him get a job. When I pressure him he'll look a little and then when I let up, he stops.

We have talked and talked and talked about this subject. I've issued ultimatums, begged, cried, yelled. Nothing fucking works so I can only believe that he's not going to change any time soon, so I need to make some decisions. 

My fears of being alone and of the kids not having their father around full time, have led to me justifying his lack of effort, but I just don't think I can do this anymore. I resent him so much for making my life harder so that his can be easier. And for just leaving me to deal with all this shit on my own. I can't take it anymore.  But If he leaves, I'm out even the $500 bucks he earns because I know he doesn't have enough to live alone and pay me child support.

**Edit:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::**

I just want to say thanks to everyone who took the time to answer. There are some details that I'm just comfortable putting out there, but I don't think they're really pertinent to the questions I had.  I guess he's found this post by now and if he did, I hope he takes something from it.  We had a pretty honest talk after I wrote this post, and I think I finally got through to him about how much this effecting my feelings for him. I hope so, because if I really, really can't live like this no matter how much I love him.  

How do I deal with telling him I want him gone? I've tried and he refuses to leave and we can't afford to move. If he changed this one thing, I'd stay and work until my last breath to make our marriage work. If he doesn't I'll end up in a bitter, nasty marriage to someone I intensely dislike.  I don't even know where to start ending it.

I need some help thinking this through.

1371487300.0,77,self.relationship_advice,1givly,Nightmare Scenario: I lost my girlfriends dog. What steps do I need to take to save the relationship?,,99,22,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1givly/nightmare_scenario_i_lost_my_girlfriends_dog_what/,"I'll start off by giving the back story, move on to how it is affecting our relationship, and then pose questions about how to proceed with our lives.

My girlfriend of less than 1 year and I live together, and we both have our own dogs. My dog is a border collie and weighs about 55lbs, and her dog is 12lb mix that resembles a papillion. They both have completely different personalities. My dog is really calm, minds well, and sticks by my side even off the leash. Her dog is skittish most of the time and only is really comfortable when she is around. Even though we both knew that he was skittish, we both agreed that it would be ok for me to walk him. Honestly, I didn't mind walking him at all because I wanted to create a bond with him and get him to trust me.

Each of our dogs have their own leash. My dog's leash is just a regular straight leash that I loop together around his neck like a lasso. I don't clip it onto his collar because he is so big and it does just fine. Her dog is small and has a retractable leash that attaches to a harness. This is the key detail of how this whole nightmare unfolded...

Last Saturday (6/8/13), I woke up early before work and took my girlfriends dog out for his morning walk. I wasn't in a rush or anything, but I probably made the biggest mistake of my life. Instead of putting his regular retractable leash/harness on, I decided to use my dogs lasso leash. There wasn't any reason behind choosing the different leash. It was just hanging up where it was supposed to be while his regular harness leash was in my gf's car. So I slipped the lasso leash onto him and took him outside for his walk.

Everything was going fine until we were ready to go back inside. I wasn't really watching what he was doing, but he was still sniffing around. As I started walking back he wasn't ready to go which created tension on the lasso leash. I guess the tension freaked him out and he immediately jerked the opposite way and slipped out of the lasso leash and just took off.

He got about a 10 yard jump on me and I ran after him as fast as I could but he was not stopping. I ran as far as I could and eventually lost sight of him. At that point I ran back to our apartment and got my bike to try and cover more ground. I looked for about an hour on my bike but I was never able to find him after I lost sight.

I woke my girlfriend up and we started the search by notifying all the neighbors and putting up flyers. Its been about nine days now since he went missing. We have been doing everything we can (posters, emailed vets, etc.), but we haven't had any luck. So, That is the back story of how everything went down and I'll go on to how our relationship has been since the day he was lost:

The moment I woke her up and told her her dog was lost she was livid. She started slapping me, throwing things, and calling me names (idiot, lazy, careless). I was telling her that I know you are mad but save that energy because right now we need to focus on finding him. As the first day unfolded she went on to saying things like ""You are so fucking horrible for doing this to me"", ""you are a murderer"", and "" I will never forgive you for this"". I understand that she was mad. I get that, but it really was an accident and I would never intentionally do something like that to hurt her. She eventually apologized that evening and said ""I'm sorry for saying those things earlier, and I understand it was an accident"". So I think she isn't as much angry as she is sad now.

Over the course of the nine days that he has been lost I have been doing everything in my power to help her find her dog. She still has the stance that she doesn't know if she'll be able to forgive me if the dog doesn't turn up. Basically, the picture she is painting is that if her dog doesn't show up our relationship will be over.

Everything was going fine in our relationship up until this point and we were getting along really well together. My questions are that is it wrong of me to hope that she will eventually forgive me? What should I do to show her that I truly care about her and that I want our relationship to continue?

I am truly heartbroken that this happened and she is so hurt. I can't even imagine how it feels to lose your dog, much less if it gets lost by someone else. I also feel like she should understand that it was an accident though. What do you guys think?

After a while we became very good friends, I'd see her once every couple of weeks and things were good. After my  housemate at the time had to move out, I asked her to move in and she did.


Fast forward 18 months and the friendship had developed into a close but platonic relationship. We'd watch movies/documentaries together at nights, shared social groups, were invited to each other's family gatherings etc. and it didn't seem to be a problem. We'd both joked about it being like marriage without the sex, and we both were OK with that.


Sarah, however, is incredibly introverted and has been known to be content with not seeing a human for a couple of months at a time (I'm more extroverted but can enjoy solitude). This was acknowledged and I was prepared to leave her alone for extended periods whenever she needed. She assured me that everything about our friendship was fine with her until one day I was told she was spending a night with a girlfriend to sort out how she felt. 



After she got back, Sarah told me that:

1. She wanted to feel like she was a single 23 year old woman, not someone tied down in a relationship.
2. She wanted to completely scale back the friendship as she always gets sick of people and struggles to form long term attachments.
3. She wants to go to living as 2 housemates, not 2 people involved in each other's lives.

To me, this all came as a complete shock. I know that in times of stress, introverts like to retreat back into themselves and she has had a few stressful things go on (just finished her first term as a teacher, her mother got remarried and she is worried about her dad).

As I have been blindsided and communication seems to have broken down (she has made it clear that she's not ready to interact right now), I was wondering if introverts or people who have been on her side of the fence (felt like a close friendship was getting too much and needing to withdraw) could help me start to understand what is going on.

I can be quite sensitive and I do have anxiety/abandonment issues stemming from a particularly toxic and abusive ex, so I basically just want to hear any advice that anyone has for me. I don't want to become clingy and anxious in this situation (this will not help things).


Thanks.

TL;DR Very close friend and housemate suddenly decided she wanted completely separate lives and new friendship dynamic. She's also incredibly introverted and I'd like advice on how to handle things.

1363681060.0,76,self.relationship_advice,1akzhf,[38/m] With an update to an old relationship [38/f] with advice from this community,redditmolestedme,92,16,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1akzhf/38m_with_an_update_to_an_old_relationship_38f/,"I posted here over a year and a half ago. The account I originally posted to has long since been deleted, but I'll post a brief account of the original story and then the update.

When I was 17 I graduated from high school (92) and joined the military. My first post was about a four hour drive from my house and I spent weekends and leave back home. I continued talking to a girl who had graduated in my class and we were eventually married. About 6 mos after I went on two deployments and then was sent for an unaccompanied tour (can't take spouses/kids). I was gone for 9 mos on the first deployment, home for 6 and then deployed for another 5. The unaccompanied tour was 12 mos. (23 mos gone total) My wife was very supportive of me during this time and understood fully why I had to be away. When I came back, I spent another couple of years stateside and then was honorably discharged. My wife was very vocal about wanting me out of the military so she could be with me (understandably). About this time, I started to receive calls from creditors for unpaid debts that ranged from the hundreds of dollars to the thousands. It took a couple months to understand the full scope of what had happened, but my wife had racked up over 50,000 dollars in unsecured debt while I was gone, using my signature as cosigner to all these loans. This put a huge strain on our relationship, but I felt we were recovering slowly. Little did I know, she was also cheating on me during this time. We went to counseling and decided mutually we couldn't reconcile the relationship (partially because it came out during counseling, she cheated on me during my deployments as well).

I was despondent about this whole process and its outcome and came here to post about it. The advice was varied but the general concensus was to grieve the loss, and begin to rebuild my life. This was around the same time the ""lawyer up, delete facebook and hit the gym"" advice started to fly. So I did.

Update: 
   I lost 100 pounds that I had gained after leaving the military and going through the depression and strain of the divorce. I went back into the reserves and have a civilian job that corresponds to what I do for the military (ATC). During the divorce, the judge ordered our assets to be sold off to pay the debt and the balance to be divided. I paid off my portion of it (about 15,000) and was able to save up and put 25% down on a house just recently. I went to my 20 year high school reunion this month and ran into my ex-wife. Our school was smallish (100 or so graduates a year) and the reunion was a multi-day event. There was a family day, I saw her (she had gained at least 30 pounds and looked like she had some bad botox) I also met her new husband and their 4 kids. The second night was a mixer at a local lounge. After a few too many drinks, my ex (who was a stumbling, sloppy mess at this point) approached me and began crying her eyes out telling me how miserable she was. Apparently she just found out prior to the reunion her husband was cheating and wanted a divorce. On top of it, she knew for sure that one of their kids wasn't his and suspected another might not be. It might be petty, but I felt vindicated.

tl;dr My wife stomped my guts out when we were young. As we got older, I changed and grew.

During this break, I read a confession on a Tumblr post from her.

Yeah, you guessed it.

During the course of our relationship she confesses to have had no physical attraction towards me, and just felt ""wrong"".

We're having work done on our house, and they've insulted all the workers, and told one guy that his work was ""amateurish"".  They're really racist, and think the hispanic workers are lazy and incompetent.

Her mom bought us cleaning supplies, even though we have cleaning people.  When I told her to take them back, she said ""the cleaning people aren't doing a good enough job""

Is it small issues that can be worked out? Or is it fundamental differences? You'll save yourself a lot of pain if you face this question and come to a conscious answer. Hurting someone is painful, prolonging their hurt is even more painful.

I just broke up with a girlfriend of 2 1/2 years. We had problems throughout the relationship. She cheated on me, and we viewed the world in generally different respects. We kept at it though, desperately trying to find common ground. She honestly regretted cheating, knowing it to be a mistake. Fast forward one year and here we are. This fight will be the last. She wants to make up for it but it has to be the end now. It's a hard thing to do. I don't know if its the right thing to do. She means a great deal to me in my life. But we are unable to reconcile certain important aspects of our character and aspirations together. We say we will fix things, but they always end up in conflict, time and time again. I just can't do it anymore, and if you find yourself in a similar situation assess things, really do. If you face reality you may save both involved a lot of pain.

**EDIT 2:  Just to clear up a mistake I made, we met when she was 16 and I was 18, and we got married about 2 and a half years after that.  She had turned 18, and I was 20.  Sorry for the confusion, and thanks, everyone, for your help.  It means a lot more than I'm able to show...**

I apologize in advance, but this will probably be pretty drawn out, and not very well-constructed...

I am 22, and she is 20.  We've been together almost 5 years, and been married for 2 1/2.  We've had our problems, and about a month ago, we had a little falling out, and we were considering spending some time apart.  We decided to not be so rash, and to think about it for a week or so.  She went out on a lunch date with my mother to discuss everything, and from what I can gather from my mother, was 110% adamant about staying together.  I had thought about it, and decided that we should stay together as well, and we were both quite happy about working together towards our future...or so I thought...


This last weekend, she was going up to see some friends that she hadn't seen in about 6 years.  These people have a bit of a jaded past, but I didn't mind so much.  My wife doesn't have a license, so they were coming to pick her up. (We live about an hour away from where they are)  The biggest thing I was worried about was her being stranded somewhere, so I asked her to just check in from time to time to reassure me that she was OK.  (I'm an excessive worrier, and I get it from my mother.)

Well, leading up to all of this, I had an increasingly growing fear of something bad happening, but I couldn't tell what it was.  While she was gone, she didn't call or text, and kept dodging my calls/texts, which didn't help my worrying at all.

When she got home, she was incredibly distant for some reason, and seemed to almost be a different person.  I told her that I was upset with her that she didn't keep in contact with me, and after a small discussion (I can't say argument here, because it really wasn't.  We were both pretty calm about things), she suddenly said that she didn't want us to be together anymore.  This completely caught me off guard, and I didn't know how to react...After me asking why a lot, and her not really giving any reason, I asked her to sleep on it, and we'd talk about it the next day.

I kept thinking that something wasn't right, throughout the day, and the pieces just weren't adding up.  After work, I went home and we talked a little more.  I worked out of her that while she was with her 2 girlfriends, they invited over about 4-5 guys, whom all she didn't know, and they all got drunk and partied.  I will admit that I was upset, and I even said so, but I didn't question anything...that is...until I worked out of her that she did know one of the guys, and it happened to be her ex.  The ex that she lost her virginity to.

I then expressed that things just weren't adding up, and I felt like she was keeping something from me.  She asked what I thought she was keeping secret, and I explained that my worst fear was that she and her ex had slept together.  She looked away, and confirmed that that was, indeed, what had happened.  I...didn't know what to say...

She then went on to say how much better in bed he was than I, and that she didn't regret it.  I had no idea what to do, being completely blindsided by this, so I left to my parents place for a shower, and some time to think...

When I came back, we talked a little more.  She's done, and I can't forgive her...so my question to you all is what now?

I'm still deeply in love with this girl.  Call me names, but I'm almost on the verge of tears just thinking about not being with her; not having her by my side. This is my first and only relationship, so I've had some serious self confidence issues in the past, and they are resurfacing fast.  I've gone from having a pretty stable 5 year plan to not knowing what I'm going to be doing next week.  I'm lost.  Again, this being my first relationship, I don't know what to expect, nor how to handle all of this.  I just don't....know what to do...

Aside of deleting facebook and hitting the gym, of course.  Please help...D:

So I'm a 23 year old male, been dating a 24 year old female for a little over a month now, been officially relationshipped for a couple weeks. We've been spending a lot of time together over the first month, and I think really like each other. It came up one night recently that in the event of needing a place to stay after the bars close that she could always crash in her guy friend's bed if necessary (no DDs available, he lives within walking distance from the bars). They have been friends for awhile. My initial reaction was ""oh, okay, where would he sleep then?"". I received the response ""well in his bed of course...."". this took me by surprise because in my own mind that would be kind of off-limits if you're in a relationship. I also failed to think of any circumstances where any of my good friend couples would have possibly done this and came to the same conclusion that none of them would consider it. I told her I was uncomfortable with it, and she got angry and said that I don't trust her, she thinks of him as a brother, they've slept together before nothing has ever happened or will happen, etc. etc.. After I didn't really budge on it during the first conversation she angrily said she wouldn't do it, it was sort of left unresolved but I was hoping that it would blow over. Almost a week goes by and things are going good and then she brings it up, she thinks that I don't trust her and I'm trying to make her decide between myself and her friends which isn't the case at all. I simply said I'm uncomfortable with her sleeping in the same bed as someone I don't know, her response was if you trust me you should trust my judgement and you should trust my friends. Again, I don't really think its a trust issue as much as it is a boundary and respect issue. I don't believe she would cheat on me, she has spoken with disdain of other cheaters she knows. I have limited information on the guy friend in question, met him once at the bars. I've seen him flirt with her, while we were together (buying her drinks, arm hovering not around her shoulder but having her between him and his hand on the bar). Oh I should also mention that while she was friendly I didn't see any reciprocated flirting from her. I mentioned this and her response was ""he's like that with everyone"". Also, I tried the role reversal, if I were to do this would you be okay with it (its actually something I wouldn't even consider) and she said yea although its easy to say yea when clearly I was never planning on doing so. So yeah, am I crazy? Should I say okay and let this slide or should I hold my ground? We've both acknowledged that this is a big deal and I would love to resolve it so that we can hopefully move on in the relationship. Thanks for any advice.

TLDR: GF thinks its okay to pass out in male friends bed with male friend after drinking since they're ""just friends"".

UPDATE 9cst: Not sure if anyone is still following this but I read all the comments which basically reaffirmed what myself and my good friends already believed. Tonight when she got off work we grabbed some food and then back at her place I brought it up. I hit every logical point from my perspective that I could think of which was quite a bit because I have been thinking about this for some time now. Unfortunately she couldn't see it from my point of view, but perhaps more disappointing was that she wasn't willing to make this small sacrifice for me for the benefit of what was a good relationship. She made the same arguments about lack of trust despite me telling her that I did in fact trust her. Also, I feel like she tried to make it more than what it was, saying that I was trying to make her choose between her and her good friends and trying to change who she is. It ended with me telling her that if we can't resolve it we're not moving forward and if we're not moving forward we probably shouldn't go on. I told her to think about it and left. Ultimately I feel like I made the correct decision, this was something important to us both and needed to be addressed. I'm appreciative of the thoughtful comments in this thread that helped me to make my decision. As far as our relationship is concerned I'm not entirely sure what will happen from here, she didn't seem to have any intention to budge from her stance. If she couldn't do this for me though it's probably best that I get out of it now rather than later though.

Over Easter break, his sister, who is 4 years older than he is, came to visit him.  I knew that the two of them were close and constantly talk on the phone with each other, and that he thinks she is one of the coolest girls he knows.  I offered her a room at my house, in the spirit of getting to know his family and making a good impression.

When she arrived, I was more than a little uncomfortable with how physically and emotionally close they were acting, right in front of me.  When I got home to meet her, she greeted me, thanked me for having her over, and then commenced to baby-talk with my boyfriend and play handsy-hands while I stood there.  I excused myself to the other side of the room under the guise of needing to do some dishes, and while I was over there, I heard things like ""tickle fight!"", and ""ha, grabbed your butt"" from the two of them for 15 straight minutes, complete with cooing and blissful ""I love you"" laughter.  When I turned around, they were both lying side by side on the air mattress I had set up for her, and they were *holding hands*.  So, uh, I went to bed without a word.  Usually he stays over at my house, but he decided it would be ""too weird"" and slept at his place for the first time in months.  Okay, I can deal with that.

Today, after trying to shake the sick feeling I got from their brother-sister cuddle time on my living room floor, I agreed to go out to a movie with them.  I open the door and she's jumping into his arms in the front yard like a pair of little kids.  Walking into the theatre and out, he would pick her up, swing her around, hug her around the shoulders.  Meanwhile, I was trying my best to laugh and not be horrified and humiliated. It was hard to tell if he was treating her as if she were his girlfriend, or if he treats me the way he treats his sister.  Either way kind of sucks.  

So, a couple questions, Reddit:
*WTF.
*Am I overreacting?
*How on earth do I approach him about this? 
*Sorry I'm freaking out.

**Edit:**  Thank you for all the input. I don't think they are fucking, and that was never a concern (I've taken tons of abnormal psych courses and I pick up no signs of incestual weirdness).   It's been really helpful to see that there isn't really a clear answer - this could be normal behavior, but I'm not the only one who would be uncomfortable.  

Update:  It's getting to the point where, when he gives me a hug, she will literally wrestle him away from me and hug him herself.  So he and I are going to have a chat when she leaves.  Until then I'm just going to try and remain emotionally removed from the situation and observe, observe, observe.

Not really advice or asking for some, but more of a story so that you can take from it what you need.

A week ago I broke up with my girlfriend because I couldn't handle her anorexia, rape victim, control freakishness etc. She had a shit-load of problems and I couldn't handle it anymore. In the end, I broke up with her saying I needed to look after myself, not her, and she said to me, without word of a lie - ""if you can't handle me at my worst, you don't deserve me at my best. You'll kick yourself when I'm better, get out of my house."" And that was that.

Since then she's slept with three different men, which is funny considering she said to me she wouldn't be able to handle another man after the rape; trust issues etc.

Anyway.

**How I found out she had been lying to me for 10 months**.

She was raped ten months ago. Or at least, she said she was. It was on holiday, and the details were sketchy even from the outset. Nevermind, I said to myself, she needs someone and just be here for her. So I was, for ten months as she used the rape to slip back into anorexia, stop us from going out and basically put both our lives on hold. She never reported it to the police and she never told anyone the full story. Her cheerleader friends didn't seem to care, which is strange 'cause I know that when one of their group was raped a while before they rallied around her like you wouldn't believe. So it was already ringing up little bells in my head. But I figured, I can't call her out because that would be fucking insensitive, whats if she WAS raped?

So I just let it slide. No matter how many of my friends say her story just simply didn't check out.

She had thrush; apparently caught from the rapist in her lady parts, rear parts and mouth. That was the first big 'er, what?' for me - she was forced to give him a blow job and got a fungal infection in her mouth? I didn't question it, but I kept that tucked away. The fact that she was apparently screaming for help and her friends in the rooms beside her didn't help, rather thought it was just 'loud sex' also rings up alarm bells. But I kept that also tucked away.

Well, we broke up last week.

Over the week, a lad added her on Facebook, and, before she could delete the post on her wall, I saw on there ""Hi, I'm *name* who you met in *holiday destination* and took back to your room for that crazy night. Just noticed you were single now so thought I'd hit you up to see if you wanted a repeat without any guilt after"" or something to that effect, I was so riled up I forgot to screenshot or copy paste.

Anyway, I called her and said what I just saw, and she just broke down and started saying she'd hoped I'd never find out because she loved me so much followed by ""not that it matters now anyway you dumped me"". So for 10 months I was looking after a false-rape screaming psychopath.

What the fuck, how could I have been so blind?! Reddit, I urge you to ALWAYS get to the bottom of things if you think something isn't right, don't just brush them under the carpet if they're as big as what this was. My whole idea of mutual trust has been ruined. I told her that I was going to tell everyone about it, and she begged and begged me not to, saying that she will be ruined and everyone will hate her etc. I told her I didn't care, but I won't tell people on the sole promise that she does.

I know she won't, but I now have a bartering chip should I ever need her to do something. ""You know when you didn't get raped..?""

Since I called her out on it, and the lads she's slept with in the past week, she's stopped being such a psycho, has started eating again and has gone back to being the girl I fell for originally. Complete mind fuck except that I know now I hold the status quo.

So the day I posted I spoke with my husband and informed him that I'd stop nagging him, and we would both just do what we saw necessary. He seemed relieved, suggested we talk about important things, I agreed and said that I was separating our accounts. He flipped out, started yelling and actually threw a few things around. Told me it wasn't good for our marriage, etc. I had plans with his sister, and when I left he wasn't speaking to me. I went ahead and did it anyway, and spoke to his sister about it. She'd recently broken up with someone who wasn't pulling his weight financially in their relationship, either, so she could relate.



Then I had to go to work and he still wasn't talking to me, so I texted his mom to let her know what was happening, and while I was at work she came over and had an hour long discussion with him. I'm not exactly sure what was said, but the house was a little tidier when I came home, and he was speaking to me and being nice. I'm not sure how long this will last, but I finally got up the courage to call my brother and tell him what had been going on. Needless to say, he was upset. He agreed with what I had already done and told me several times to stick to the deadlines I had set and not let anything deter me.



Back in February I had informed my husband if he didn't get a job by the end of April, I was taking the baby and moving out. It was more extreme than my other ultimatums(do the dishes or I won't cook dinner, put away your clothes or I'll stop washing them, etc.) and I'm definitely nervous about following through, if it comes to that. He seems motivated but still has yet to apply anywhere, and I just got hired to start a new job in a few weeks so I'm worried he'll use my change of schedule as an excuse. I'm mostly worried that I'll end up moving out and our relationship won't recover. I really do love him, I didn't marry him on a whim, but I need to make sure the people in my son's life are setting a good example for him.



TL;DR: I'm not sure if things are better, but I sure as hell hope they are.



Also, for those interested, while Accounting wasn't my original goal in college, it is still something I'm interested in. I have several friends whose parents are accountants who let me know about the field before I dived in, so don't worry.

I also feel the need to mention that I don't plan on, nor have I ever, keeping my son from my husband. He's still his father, he will always be his father, and I will always allow him time with his son. I only said I was taking our son with me because I know that as long as he is with me, he will have everything he needs.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_1bll7g,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1bll7g/update_i21f_am_thinking_of_leaving_my_husband23m/,

Basically, long story short his feet always smell terrible and his penis often smells badly as well. He comes over to my dorm a lot, and my roommate is fine with it because they're really good friends, but whenever he leaves we have to douse the room in Febreze (usually multiple times) because his feet smell that badly. I've noticed he'll wear the same socks 2 or 3 days in a row, and tried to bring it up once a while ago, but he got really defensive so I stopped.



The other big problem is his penis. He's really great in bed, but he smells. Sometimes it's worse than others. He's uncircumcised, and pretty much as soon as he takes his jeans off I can smell him. He's my first, so I honestly didn't know this was abnormal for a long time. The thing is, after we have sex my vagina noticeably smells like him for about 2 days afterwards- I don't usually have a noticeable smell, only after we have sex and then it smells like him. Most times it's not unbearable, but it was really bad today so I tried to bring it up in the least confrontational, least mean way possible (we were going to have sex but he really smelled, so I basically said hey, I'm really attracted to you, but you kind of smell off sometimes. Do you think you could clean up a bit?) and he got super upset, and kept passive aggressively doing things like kissing me and then going ""wait, never mind, you don't want to touch me because I stink.""  


He's NEVER like this, the only time he's ever gotten upset with me is when I try to bring up the hygiene issues. I know it's just a basic hygiene thing- I've showered with him before and he doesn't wash under his foreskin (he says it's uncomfortable when the water hits it?), and I've noticed him wearing the same pair of underwear multiple days in a row too. Is there some way I can get him to come around?

Context: I financially supported him for our entire relationship. I was open and communicative with him. We shared everything. When I was having a bad day, I told him. When I was unhappy, I told him. When I was unhappy with him, I told him. He was a wonderful boyfriend, but he never left the apartment, rarely took me out, rarely saw my performances (I'm a performer), and never liked spending time with my family. So, my sister went to Paris to finish her PhD, and invited me along. I jumped on the opportunity.

While I was gone, he was suspicious and read my emails without my permission. He discovered a draft that never got sent, where I expressed my unhappiness with the relationship and my desire to end it in search for happiness.

My boyfriend blows up over IM while I'm in Europe, basically forcing me to come home early or else he would throw out all of my things.

He breaks up with me before I even understand what's happening. I'm furious that he betrayed my trust and read my emails.

He picked me up from the airport, and from then on he has tried to make my life a living hell. He tried to keep the apartment (that I pay for), my car (in my name), and even tried to change all the passwords to my accounts. He managed to calm down and move out a month later. 

A couple weeks after the break up, I created an OkCupid account out of curiosity. I never did manage to go on a single date because my ex discovered the account, stole my password, and deleted it.
I made the mistake of letting him back into my life because he wanted to start over with a casual sex relationship. Before I know it, he's sobbing every night begging me to take him back. I desperately wanted too, but I knew that I couldn't trust him.
During all this time, I still had the OkCupid account sitting there collecting messages. My ex was so angry, accusing me of reading the messages from OkCupid while I was with him. 

He came over last Friday, let himself into my apartment without my permission, and threw my trash can at me. He threw me to the ground, pulled my hair, and slapped me. He shoved me against the wall and started throwing things at me. I finally got away and hid in the restroom and threatened to call police. He left instantly.

I moved back in with my parents after this situation. Ever since, he's been emailing me, telling me I'm the unstable one. Apparently, I'm the crazy one, the abusive one, the manipulative one. The reality has been that he never listened to me or let me say no. He never listened to ""no"". I still have the bruises on my body from what he's done, but he still won't leave me alone. 

He's been cyberstalking me, creating fake facebook accounts and friending me, and threatening to release nude photos (I've learned my lesson) of me online. He also wants to get me fired.

But apparently, he claims that I'm the crazy one who broke up with him out of the blue. I sitting here with visible bruises on my legs, and his emails are emotionally draining to read.

To make matters worse, he's been writing about me on reddit saying that I distanced myself from him and never voiced my concerns. This is all a load of bullshit. He was the one who played videogames all day long and wouldn't communicate at all. (I don't have anything against videogames, but my ex played 12-14 hrs on a Saturday, and he wouldn't eat while playing videogames).

I did give him my reasons for breaking up with him, I did communicate with him, and now he's violent and stalking me.

TLDR; I'm going through a really terrible violent break up. Help!

",DontWannaRuinIt,96,22,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wte5j/26m_ive_been_married_for_10_months_and_my_wife/,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post. This is a first time post for me, I don't really know where to turn for help on this one...

I've been married since last september.  It's been great for the most part. Our biggest issue is overcoming debt (mainly mine) so that we can afford to buy a house. But apart from the occasional argument, (which almost all stem from my debt/credit situation) we're really great.  We love each other very much. 

Recently an old ex-boyfriend of my wife's started texting her. She was honest and told me that he has and that he had told her that she was ""the one that got away"" and I know that he has said ""sweet"" things to her and played the ""I bet your husband doesn't do that for you"" card on her and generally just being a snake. One morning after attending the baptism of a friend's new baby, I was taking pictures with my wife's phone for her, and in came a text that was fairly vulgar; something along the lines of ""I want to bend you over and spank you like that bad girl you are"" Obviously this disturbed me.

She deletes all her texts and always has as long as i've known her. And when I asked her about the vulgar text I saw she said she doesn't reply to those, only the ones where he's a ""normal guy"" as in not trying to be sexy. 

She's going out of town back home to visit her mom this weekend, and has told me that she's going to be meeting up with this guy while there and likely going out to eat. Needless to say, this makes me uncomfortable.  I've mentioned this to her, and she tells me that she's only doing it to give him closure, and make him get the picture that she's married and that theres no chance and that I should trust her since we're married. 

This week, while looking over our wireless bill I noticed several lengthy conversations via text with this guy's number. Some Lasting an hour or two. 

I'm concerned but I don't want to be that overbearing insecure jealous husband that makes a self-fulfilling prophecy and push her to do something with this guy. I've been cheated on in the past and so i have a deep neurosis about this kind of thing, and the thought of it stirs all kinds of emotions in me and I don't love it. 

I need some help to know what to say to my wife to illustrate how much I love her, and what she means to me, while also respectfully letting her know how uncomfortable this situation makes me feel.  I love my wife and I don't want to share her. Please help :(

TL;DR My wife has been texting an ex from high school and will be meeting up with him while out of town visiting her mother. I'm not thrilled about it and need advice...Please read to get details.

EDIT: WOW FRONT PAGE!! I didn't expect this much response! thank you for all your help, I am at work right now and can't read them all but i will check on my breaks. thank you all!

**UPDATE:** Thank you all for your support and advice. It means worlds to me that you each took time out of your days to help out a stranger who was just feeling lost.  Many of you expressed that i should ""grow a pair"" and ""stop being a doormat (pussy)""  All things that are true, but hard to hear with such bluntness nonetheless.  

Last night after work, I spoke with my wife, and expressed calmly and succinctly my concerns and feelings. I told her that I trust her and love her and that if she felt she needed to meet this guy, then it's her decision to make and I cannot command her not to. But my concern is that he, having made clear his intentions with the vulgar texting, does not respect her as a woman, or our marriage, let alone me. So my concern is what message that would send this boy about our marriage and commitment to one another

At this point, my wife got up and sat down next to me, and apologized, and said, ""I'll cancel on him right now and not meet him."" She then proceeded to tell him, via text (while letting me watch) that she would not be meeting with him out of respect for me. And that she will not be seeing him ever again. Within moments she received a reply, a very angry reply. He was swearing at her and called her a bitch and complained that he had changed plans for the meeting etc. etc. She then replied that she was sorry that he had changed plans but that she didn't truly care because ""My husband matters more."" and finally ended it by deleting his number and texting him to ""Lose my number"" which was what she had told him when she broke up with him in high school. 

We then had a decent conversation about my feelings and how appreciative I was of her understanding in this situation.  

Thank you all again, so very much. Special thanks go out to Seth_Cohen, ishshetheone_quiz, ohmygoditskatrina, for your real and honest advice and concern, and especially Helios410 for the book, I'm reading it already, and  its got great tools to help. And finally Deradius I can't thank you enough for putting words to my feelings. It was your suggestion that formed the framework for me to eloquently state my case and for that I cannot thank you enough. 

My wife and I stayed up late last night talking about it all; and you've all helped me to find something in myself that i had lost. Be that my courage or masculinity or whatever you want to call it. I'm on the road to being the husband that my wife needs and deserves. I told her that i was sorry for not giving her the attention that this guy was, and for not being the assertive man that she needs.  After all of this I've learned a lot about myself and how my previous relationships and hurts have left me scarred and weak when it comes to romantic pursuits.  I'd been taking my wife for granted and not being a MAN and that is changing. This whole situation and all your help has spurred an epiphany for me and for that i truly thank each and every one of you.

In the beginning of our relationship all I knew was that she was overweight. I didn't care, I liked her. She's a nice girl so I ignored her weight and liked her regardless.

Then I found out some of her bad habits. She smokes ALL the time. It's ridiculous. I don't like kissing her because it's like kissing an ash tray. Not only is she overweight, but she pigs out like crazy. She eats at In N out &amp; mcdonalds everyday. It's as if she has no self respect for herself. She wastes all the money she gets from work (babysitting) on beer, cigs, and fast food instead of saving up for a car/apartment/ etc. She refuses to get a real/stable job because she says she can't find one, when she's not even trying to look for a job. She always says how she's going to save up for a car/apartment/tv/etc. but NEVER sticks to her word.  

A few months ago she made a pact that she would quit smoking, drinking, go to the gym 4 times a week and eat better. I told her that she should slow down and take this little by little. She yelled at me and said I was wrong.. now it's months later and woopdey doo nothing changed! I know I sound mean typing all this - but in reality I'm really kind about it. I'm just venting. 

I occasionally point out these issues but she just basically says ""fuck you I'll do it when I want"". It's really damaging are relationship. 

Whenever I try to talk to people about it, people call me an asshole for trying to change her and only caring about physical features when that's not the case at all. I love her for the person she is, but physical features matter a lot too. It's hard to keep dating her when she's unhealthy, lazy, coughing and smells like smoke. I feel like a douche even making this post, but it really **really** bothers me. I don't want to break up with her because I love her to death and can't imagine life without her.. but this.. this is really making me consider it. She says she loves me.. but if she did why isn't she trying to change? :/ 

**also not to mention sex is completely out of the question. We never have sex and she continues to wonder why.. when the reason is obvious. I'm not physically attracted to her at all.. I feel terrible saying this.**

[very, very long]",dudewheresmythrow,94,20,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/srz9c/my_girlfriend_is_sick_and_theres_a_shitstorm/,"At this point, I've talked to so many friends and family members about this, this post feels more like catharsis rather than a call for advice on what to do next. However I am willing to listen to anybody who feels like offering any thoughts, criticisms, or reassurances.

Nature of the relationship: boy-girl, early 20s, 2+ years, living together in an apartment for the past eight months. We've had some difficulties before that I've posted under this throwaway.

A couple weeks ago, out of the blue, my girlfriend got appendicitis. I helped to get her to the hospital, I waited with her while she awaited a diagnosis, and I stayed for her surgery and admittance to the recovery clinic. (The day didn't end until about 2:30 am.) For the next few days, they kept her in the hospital, making sure she was okay to go home with some regular medication. She came home for a few days, but then had to be readmitted to the hospital when she developed an infection. It took almost a full week for her to be treated properly and be discharged from the hospital.

During these couple of weeks, I have been really stressed out. This month has probably been one of the worst in my young life so far. There are a couple things stacked on top of the appendicitis. I've been unemployed for three months, and so I'm still desperately looking for a job. Our financial situation has become a mess. I have been providing my share of the money through savings accounts and money loaned to me by my parents, but it's been difficult to keep up. Back when I still had my job, I thought it'd be a good idea to give my girlfriend a credit card that was under my account. Turns out that was a mistake, and since I did that the debt on the card has been rampant. I am going to have to take drastic measures to deal with the debt because we can't pay it off in full at the end of this month. I was going to have a conversation with her about this, but then the appendicitis happened and it didn't seem like a good time any more.

Because of the stress, I was not acting myself, and I became somewhat withdrawn. I would bring my computer to the hospital and diddle away on that, or my smartphone. I would waste some time on sites like Reddit, because I badly needed distraction from dealing with the situation. But, I was also trying to job-hunt. Additionally, it was not like I was not helping out. I watched over my girlfriend, helped administer her medicine, and ran errands for her. But to her, it was not enough. To make matters more difficult, I didn't really know what my place in all of this should be. We live in the same city as her family, and her mom was with her pretty much every step of the way, and I often felt like I was being pushed aside. I didn't want to upset or irritate her mom, so I would keep my distance a little bit when she was around, and ended up following her orders rather than trying to work with her as a partner in care of my girlfriend. This created some tensions.

One morning near the end of her second week in the hospital, my girlfriend unloaded on me. She told me that I needed to fight for her more. She felt like she hadn't had her best friend with her for the last two weeks, and it was killing her. She told me that I'd lost the respect of her entire family! She called me a narcissistic asshole, and thought I needed to see a therapist. On top of that, she wanted me to go back and be with my family (several states away) for a couple of weeks or months. I felt somewhat shocked, but I knew that I hadn't been acting quite myself, so I immediately fell into guilt and pretty much kowtowed to her. Later I spoke to my parents, who thought that my behavior was pretty much to be expected given the stressors I was dealing with. They didn't think I was narcissistic, and they didn't think I should come home.

That same day, in the evening, I went back to the hospital to drop some stuff off for my girlfriend from our apartment. She was not in good shape, and was pretty out of it from drugs. She asked me, in front of her mom, if I had discussed with my parents what we had discussed earlier in the day. Because she wanted to talk about this in front of her mom, I balked at first, and my girlfriend angrily snarled ""bullshit"" at me, and her mom escorted me out of the room. I was pretty upset at this point...I didn't think things had gotten this bad. I talked to my parents again, and they were a bit surprised. They told me to text my girlfriend that I felt a bit hurt by what she did. My girlfriend said she didn't remember what she said because she was so out of it, and asked me what it was. At this point, my parents advised me to turn off my phone after telling her that we should just talk it over face-to-face later. This was a turning point.

Right before I went to bed that night, I turned my phone on in case there was an emergency. In the morning, I discovered a couple voicemails and several missed calls, and found out she was having emergency surgery to deal with her infection. I rushed to the hospital, and texted her and her mom that I was there. Her mom came down to the lobby where I was waiting, and flipped shit on me. She told me my girlfriend had cried herself to sleep that night because she didn't know what had happened, and that I was bumbling, useless, and was not to see my girlfriend again until she said so, otherwise I would be escorted out of the hospital by security. I leave, completely horrified and miserable.

A couple tense days pass. I pretty much get more of the same from my girlfriend and her mom. Yesterday afternoon, my girlfriend tells me she wants to speak with me in the hospital. She's going to be discharged. She tells me that she thinks I should go home immediately so that we can have a break for a couple of months. She also needs the apartment to recover because it's a bit crowded in her family's house. At first I am defiant, but more and more I start to feel that maybe she's right. I reluctantly agree, but I call my parents again to tell them about it. They urged me not to leave, for several reasons:

* I have paid the rent in full for this month and next month

* I have no money of my own left, only the money my parents have loaned me

This is the first time he has done anything like this, and I would like to take this to court in hope he could get some therapy.

I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/myktr/have_to_meet_girlfriends_dad_alone/) thread a while back.


I decided to go with some advice posted, to tell her dad the truth. I went to their house sometime last week, and her dad let me in. My girlfriend was also there and we all sat in her living room. He shrugged, as if to say, ""So?"" So I told him, ""I realize that you're worried that (gf) and I are having sex. And the truth is, we are. But that is her choice, not mine."" He completely flipped out. He started shouting, and telling me to get the fuck out of his house. My girlfriend started crying. I haven't had much contact with her since then, since she's trying to block me out of her life, but from what I've gathered, she was kicked out of her house and had to move in with her old drugdealer friend. She apparently blames me for completely ruining her life. But you know what? I'm just kidding. What actually happened is in the next paragraph.


We sat down in the living room as I said. My girlfriend and I had prepared a little information sheet on me, because her dad isn't too good with English. It did say something about me agreeing with her decision to wait till marriage or something. I also brought some Christmas cookies I made myself. The whole meeting took about 10 minutes because he had to leave, but during that meeting he said it's ok if we go on the vacation. In fact, he seemed to take everything really well. I think he liked that I called him personally on the phone to meet up with him to talk about this. My girlfriend even asked him if I could come with them to some annual event they go to, and he said that would be good. So it looks like a lot of progress was made. 


I only wish we had decided to do this about two years ago. But we never really knew what to do. So to everyone with disapproving SO's parents, I suggest asking to meet them in private. Even if it doesn't actually happen, your ability to show that you are serious about this and that you want to interact with them will help. 


Thanks for the advice, /r/relationship_advice! Posting on here helped give me the mental willpower to take the first step and call the guy.

So last night, I finally opened up and told him what was going on. I said ""I don't want you to think it's you, but I haven't ever had an actual orgasm from sex. It feels really good but I've never actually gotten there. I feel like I've been lying to you and I don't want to.""

After answering a few questions from him about whether I had ever actually gotten any other type of orgasm before and whether anybody else had ever made me go from penetration (they haven't), he said: ""Oh wow that really sucks. I'm sorry. Okay well let me know what I need to do and I'll do it.""

As we were talking it out, I asked him if he was upset and he said ""It's not like anybody else could and I couldn't you know? It really does suck for you but as long as you're happy with it then I'm fine. We can work on whatever we need to just tell me what you need me to do.""

I told him that I wasn't quite sure but I wanted him to help me figure it out. He said okay and we would figure it out. No awkwardness after, and we continued the night just fine!

So we've been together for 2-3 months, officially dating  for 2-3 weeks now, and I gotta say she is everything I could ask for aside from the sex.  I don't often meet a person I am this happy with, who is also happy with me.  I think she is just incredible.

However, in the bedroom she pretty much just lays there and waits for me to initiate.  I have to ask her or physically drag her to get her on top, and she doesn't like to be there for long.  I feel like I'm doing all the work, except or when she ocassionally goes downtown (which she is very good at).

I want her to be more proactive and more **excited** in bed.  I've tried being patient and letting her get comfortable, and saying things like ""I like when you do [this],"" but she seems stuck in her ways.  Randomly in conversation last night, she mentioned that she thinks a guy should be on top 80% of the time.  I said ""I think it's more 50/50"" and she said ""NUH UH!"" To which I replied, ""that's been my experience,"" and then she suddenly got very quiet, like I had offended her.

RA, please spare me the obvious ""talk to her"" crap.  I GET IT.  Communication is key, obviously.  But just saying ""talk to her"" is totally unhelpful.  There are a million things I could say that would end up just making her feel insecure.

Looking forward to your advice and also any related experiences you may have had!

**EDIT:  I'm not talking about positions.  I'm basically saying that she is sexually lazy, and I want her to pull her weight a little bit.  I want her to jump on me once in a while, use her hands, kiss my stomach...basically do anything besides just lay there and receive pleasure.**

**Another way to put it is, I want to actually feel desired, rather than feeling lucky for getting some at all.**

Fucking pathetic and depraved.  I felt like becoming a Catholic (again) after seeing all that lust for flesh out in the open, these people seem truly bound for hell.

I had no idea this was part of who she was until after I asked her to marry me.  I've never clicked with a woman like this before, but this is definitely a moment where I feel we have 'irreconcilable differences' and I want her to stop, but know that is wrong since it is part of who she is and what she likes.  She compared it to my love of snowboarding, if you can believe. What's worse is I've helped raise her daughter for the last five years (she was five now ten) and separating is going to possibly traumatize this girl and possibly expose her to some of these depraved old weirdos if I'm not around. 

This week is crazy but we have some time alone Sunday morning and I'll give her the ultimatum, it's either me or the erotic parties.  I feel that's just caging a tiger and is wrong, but she may go for it out of her affection for me.

So last night when we had sex for the first time, I was disappointed beyond belief. The length was fine, but the width was... maybe the diameter of a quarter? Possibly just a tad bigger? If that was the only issue it might have still worked out ok, but he couldn't get hard very well and couldn't keep it up for very long either...

I'm hoping it isn't just me. In my past experiences, the only people who've had this issue with me are people who are or recently stopped being virgins, which I know this guy wasn't...

Sex for me (as for most people) is really important, so if I'm not enjoying it, I'm extremely unsatisfied, which reflects on the relationship and makes it entirely not worth it for me.

How do I even approach this problem?

Well here I go…
I met a man about 16 months ago, He was handsome, charming, kind and spontaneous! We fell so deeply in love, everything was perfect! He literally was everything I ever dreamed of.

My world crashed down on me when I saw his other side, He became mean and violent. He blamed me for his anger; He would tell me that he was only angry because I MADE HIM THAT WAY. I am not innocent, I have antagonized and not been completely sensitive to all of his feelings but I don’t deserve this. For example: He thinks I should know how he is feeling and then he wants to be left alone without talking about the problems and then there is no solution. He gets to calm down while I cry myself to sleep because I feel rejected, hurt and angry. When he calms down, I am not aloud to talk about my feelings (or he gets so mad at me) I am only aloud to take total responsibility and give completely into him. 

Last week he was abusive with me: He called me horrible names, cunt, bitch and so on. 
I want to try and make him feel better so I try to tell him how much name calling hurts me and I try to calm him down but I guess it just makes things worse because he became physically abusive where I have marks all over my body. My head is pounding and emotions are flying. 
I am safe now – we no longer live together and I honestly don’t really have any family so I am alone and I think that’s the hardest part of leaving him. Being alone. 

I need out, there’s nothing more I can do or give him- my life is to valuable. 
I need some sort of advise, some way to make this easier. My heart wants him but my logic knows better.

A few months ago, I found out my wife drunkenly confessed to having feelings for one of my best friends.... TO HIM. The guy, I'll call him ""AJ"", didn't tell me. One of our other friends found out, confronted her, and she told me herself.

Since then, she's said a lot that she's not happy- that feelings for him came from her having low self esteem and not communicating well in our relationship. We've really made a lot of progress since then. She agreed not to speak to him anymore- in person, phone or online, and from what I know, she's been true to that. Which brings me back to AJ. After this all happened, he INSISTED he didn't feel the same way about her, he had no idea, etc. BUT... he always flirted with her, texted her, found excuses to be alone with her... whatever. On one occasion, she went to the hospital for an emergency surgery (appendix), and he went to her bedside for more than 24 hours. I was visiting my mom a few states away. Then there were all the private jokes they had, the physical contact I'd see (flirty pushing and whatnot). I should have seen it sooner- but it's not important now. 

Anyway, he's contacted her once or twice since that night. He told her that he missed us, wanted to work things out, wanted to be friends- but he told HER all of this. Not me. I want to move past it, I do... but I get a weird feeling from it. Why is he still contacting her? Is it possible he didn't know, or is he just trying to get close to her again?

Last night I was upset by the whole thing, and she told me that she thinks she may be a lesbian. This obviously took me by surprise. She agreed the most important thing is our daughter, and that she wants to stay together as a family. She said it wasn't fair to me to never be able to feel intimate with someone, and then she mentioned an open marriage, (where neither of us can ever bring anyone back to our house of course).

I love my wife. I really only want to be with my wife. But to be fair, I love my daughter more. I want to be around her all the time. But 17 more years of being celibate sounds pretty terrible. I feel trapped, and I'm just not sure if this is a good idea. I don't want a divorce. Has anyone ever had success with this? Can it work? Is it possible to keep it on the DL? Can it ever be healthy?

Reddit, I'm badly in need of some advice. Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Thank you to everyone who has commented. You have really given me strength. My wife has agreed to go to a personal therapist and couples therapy to try to work on herself and our marriage. As I mentioned, I am taking a new job and will be home much more. You all gave me the focus to have a rational discussion with her and tell her that I couldn't do an open relationship. I also told her that if it doesn't work out, I won't hate her for it but we should find a way to go our separate ways and still be 50/50 with our daughter. She said she really hopes it never comes to that. Thank you all, you gave me exactly what i needed today.

I'm only asking that she slows down.,nototheink,93,19,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/qmjpt/my_wife_wants_to_get_a_tattoo_im_only_asking_that/,"I'll start by saying that I don't want to control my wife. I really don't. But I do know that she can be a bit impulsive. 

Long story short, she wants to get a memento of her favorite band: the word ""Doomed"" tattooed on her collarbone. This will be her first tattoo. She has been in love with this band for, perhaps, a year. I originally said that she should wait a year to make sure that the tattoo is a good idea. She said I was controlling her and refused to listen. In an attempt to compromise I asked that she first create the tattoo in long lasting marker as a sort of trial run. I don't know if there is a sharpie that will last a week but that's along the lines of what I'm thinking. 

I can think of a million reasons that she could regret the tattoo, but the most obvious and immediate one is that her collarbone is often exposed at work, and the tattoo would effectively strike a large portion of her current wardrobe out the window. She takes a long time to get dressed every morning as it is, trying on multiple outfits, and I don't think this can help. Her response is that she can put a band-aid on it. The larger problem is that I think it will embarrass her down the road.

I know my thoughts on tattoos are more conservative than some, but I try to keep those thought only as they pertain to *my* body. As much I would never do it to myself, I can genuinely admire the beautiful artwork that some choose to make their bodies into. In the case of my wife however, its not so much that I don't like the idea of tattoos, as much as it is I know she will regret this down the road and I don't want to see her unhappy.

At least, that's what I think. I could, of course, be completely wrong. Perhaps I am only justifying my overly conservative value-pushing through mental gymnastics. At least I'm sure that's what she thinks.

I don't think that my requests (demands?) are all that unreasonable. One week with an impermanent version of the tattoo. As it stands, she plans to go ahead and get the tattoo without my blessing.

To me, this is a longer lasting facet of a larger communication problem where my opinion (forced morals?) go unheard.

What can I do to stop her from getting a permanent mistake (quick fix, hopefully) and what can I do to make myself heard without being overly controlling? Or am I simply projecting my own fears?

Please, any advice on relationships, communication, or tattoos would really help. And thank you.

EDIT: clarifying certain thoughts

EDIT 2: PEOPLE. PLEASE. I understand if my wife's actions strike you as immature, that feeling is probably the main thing that is frustrating me as well. But belaboring the point or mocking her really isn't helping anything and, frankly, pisses me off. I'm looking for solutions to a communication issue.

One of the ways I escaped reality, sought deeper connections, and tried to create sentimental experiences with those around me was to do drugs.

I smoked about half a very small bowl every weekend for four years on and off. I also did ecstasy three times and mushrooms twice. There was also an instance in which I did methadone, which he swears is the same as me doing heroin.

Once in a while my boyfriend gets very upset that I did these things even though they happened years before we dated. I have since decided to stop doing drugs. This is a choice I made on my own. However, my boyfriend believes I have permanently altered my brain chemistry and will never be the same person I was before I put these things in my body. I feel like he's looking down on me and that I should never have made the choices I did.

What do I do?",SomeGuy640,91,19,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18q1gl/i_want_to_help_her_but_shes_just_too_much_to/,"While grabbing breakfast during my first week of college, I noticed a lonely looking girl who I recognized from my floor. I invited her to sit with me, and we had a nice conversation. She seemed pretty nervous, and I heard that she was having a tough time adjusting to college and she missed her parents. 

In the following weeks, she started coming to my room to visit, and usually to talk about her personal problems or social anxieties. I tried to be supportive and give her good advice, but it didn't really seem to have any impact on her. She would tell me the same things like ""I'm nervous that I won't have friends"" or ""everyone here is so nice, I don't know what to do."" (I still don't really understand why that last one was a problem). She never seemed to make any friends, and she started to come in more and more. I honestly wanted to be that friend that she never had and help her break out of her shell, but I didn't work out. I feel awful saying this, but she just became too much to handle.

It began to get out of hand, with her visiting 3 to 4 times a day, and sometimes staying for hours. She stopped knocking for entrance and began just barging in unannounced. She also started trying to flirt with me in really uncomfortable ways. For example, I would just be lying in bed, and she would come in the room and then literally flop on top of me and just sit there. She would lean on me, poke my arm muscles and just be generally creepy and pretty much intolerable. She also continued to talk about her problems which I really couldn't help her with.

I am gay, and I have literally no attraction to her. During last semester's finals week, I naturally got pretty stressed out, and one day when she was creepily flirting with me in my room when I really needed to be studying, I just told her that I was gay so that she would stop bothering me and back off a bit. She ended up leaving a while later, and it seemed to work.

I found out later that she began talking to my roommate about how sad she was that I wasn't interested in her, and that she had a gay friend in high school who she tried to convert because she couldn't accept that he was gay and didn't want to be with her. So obviously that made me nervous...

After a while she began coming in my room again, even more than before. Since she wouldn't knock or anything, I decided that I was going to lock my room from then on. My roommate and I were pretty good at remembering to lock the door, but on weekends I would have lots of friends coming in and out, and she would always find her way into my room. Sometimes she would wait in the lounge for someone to come into my room and then follow them in. She would make my friends uncomfortable while we were trying to have fun, and she continued trying to flirt with me.

I decided to send her a text after one night when she was acting particularly badly. I told her that she shouldn't waste her time chasing after me and I reminded her that I was gay and that it just couldn't happen. She said ""okay,"" but things only got worse.

One Saturday night my roommate forgot to lock the door when we went out to another dorm to hang out. He came back at about 12 to grab some food from out of the room and he found her in there alone, sitting on my bed. He told her she had to get out. This has happened one other time.

Recently I think she has realized that her presence isn't always appreciated, and she's begun basically trying to buy our friendship. She'll come in with hoards of candy to give me, and she'll offer to buy my friends and me pizzas and ridiculous stuff like that. I tell her that she shouldn't spend so much money on us, but she insists, and sometimes we'll accept...

This probably sounds whiny and I feel like a jerk for talking about her like this, but she has become so invasive in my life and I can't take it anymore. I avoid going to my dorm because I know within a few minutes she will come in and make me feel uncomfortable. My friends and I don't hang out in there on the weekends anymore either. I really need to do something about this. She is very emotionally unstable, and I fear that if I am too up front with her that she will get really depressed. Does anyone have any advice?

I'm not sure if this is in the right subreddit, and if anyone knows one which would be more appropriate, please let me know.

tl;dr: Poor, shy girl is destroying my privacy and making me feel uncomfortable. Halp.

I am extremely happy with the relationship and my girlfriend appears to and says she is happy with it. My girlfriend was originally never going to go to college and was just working a dead-end retail job. No one in her family has gone to college so they all said ""You don't need to go to college."". Both of us feel that I managed to give her a chance at a better life because she was raised to ignore her options. My family loves her and I get along great with her family despite some differing opinions. However now a wedge is being driven between me and her family.

I was raised from in a catholic family. They don't believe marriage is a good idea until you are at least 25 or have stable careers started. Living together is fine if it is must. They approve of my girlfriend and I living together due to both of using going to school out of town and not being able to afford an apartment alone, and the fact that dorms are more expensive than if we just split the bills for a place. My family has made is clear that they won't stop me from getting married or lecture me about it. They just simply say ""Waiting does not hurt."" and leave it at that. In the less religious parts of my family, almost every single relationship &amp; marriage has failed within 5 years. I've only seen 3 marriages in my entire family last longer than 5 years. My grandparent's, an uncle's, and a cousin's. All of them didn't get married until 26+ and dated for 3+ years.

My girlfriend's family is on the complete opposite of the spectrum. Nearly all of them have gotten married at 18 and had children before 20. Surprisingly, it has worked out for all of them. Her parents got married within a month of graduating high school and have been married for 30 years. Her family is getting increasingly irritated and mad that I haven't proposed to her. They are starting to accuse me of not wanting to be with her and scared of taking a commitment. My girlfriend was horrified and broke down crying when she was told to think about breaking up with me because I haven't proposed.
All of this is very hard on my girlfriend because she was raised and taught that getting married very young is completely normal and the right thing. She has seen no bad in her family with it and many of her friends (who I have 0 respect for) are getting married and even having children. She has the thought ingrained in her that if you are happy in a relationship, get married, doesn't matter how long you have been dating. She admitted to wanting it not even 5 months into a relationship. Her family and friends are pushing her very hard for her to get married. They still even occasionally push for us having children before we are even done with our undergrad. Luckily my girlfriend has enough intelligence to realize that is the most horrendous advice out there.

My girlfriend and I discussed everything last night. She admits her upbringing and feelings towards marriage might not necessarily be best. She told me that she understands my opinion towards it and will never push it on me because she is happy just to be with me. She says although she still has a strong desire to get married, that neither of us should feed it or give into it until I feel comfortable because in the end, marriage shouldn't change a relationship. I personally do not see why we should get married. I don't see any benefits, we are young and our personalities are likely to change in the coming years, and I don't think 2 years is long enough to fully get to know a person. I'm not seeing why we can't just live our lives and not 'rush' anything.

Now, what is the problem? My girlfriend and I have come to an understanding. Well, all of that is actually really just background. The real problem is her family.

If my girlfriend tells them to stop bothering us about marriage, they get pissed at her and tell her to break up with me and move out because obviously she ""doesn't want to be with me"" if she doesn't want marriage. They believe me not wanting to get married is a sign that I don't want to be with her and that I could possibly be unfaithful. Even though we live several hours away from her parents, they can still cause a lot of damage and they are threatening us with it. My girlfriend's phone bill, car insurance, school, and medical bills (over $2000 and rising due to surgeries/injuries) are paid by her parents. Her car is under her parent's name. They are threatening to take all of that away. My girlfriend has also got most of her hours cut for her job. She is having trouble paying her half of the bills. Her family doesn't want to help unless we get married so now she is forced to get help from my family. I have been told that her family is going to slowly make her life harder until one of these things happen:
1. We get married
2. I break up with her or she breaks up with me
If neither happen then they are practically disowning her until one of those happen. This brings a hard decision for me. Do I give in so that we can be comfortable during our college years, or do I keep my beliefs and basically force my girlfriend to separate from her family? Everything was great and problem free until about the 1 year mark of dating where they started increasingly putting pressure on us to get married. Now it has reached a peak and they are starting to take action.

tl;dr: Girlfriend's family is pushing us to get married. Ready to push great financial burden on us if we don't give in and basically disown their own daughter.

He's your standard introvert, socially awkward, gamer geek guy. I went to Cosmetology school, want to be a make-up artist, and possibly own my own salon one day. 

Over-all, we get along great, don't argue, help each other through everything. We spend a lot of time at the house playing Minecraft or Final Fantasy together, but occasionally, me being a bit more social than him, I'll insist on us going out somewhere (usually just to dinner, which I often pay for since we're both tight on cash and it was upon my insistence, or to out mutual friend's house). When I say occasionally, I mean like a few time a month, maybe, not that it's necessarily a problem, but I don't want people thinking I'm constantly jerking him out of his comfort zone. 

Anyway, I go to get dressed and ask him how I look, and he makes a face. When I ask what's wrong he responds ""I like the way you look when you dress casual.""

Girls are always told to find a guy that thinks we're beautiful with no make-up, hair a mess, sweat pants, and a T-shirt, and my bf does, but I also want him to think I'm pretty when my make-up is done, and I'm wearing a pair of nice jeans and a pretty shirt. It's not like I look like I belong on Jersey Shores when I'm done or anything like that.

I know he'd prefer me in jeans and a T-shirt, but I really see that as like yard work clothes, or maybe when I'm sick and really don't give a fuck about my appearance. I don't feel pretty in those things. At all. Period. 

I try to tell him that I understand his preference, but that I also need him to find me pretty in what I consider to be my ""every day"" clothes too, because it's getting to the point where I just never feel pretty in anything. If I wear casual clothes, I feel like a slob. If I wear my normal clothes, I feel overdone. 

I don't really know what to do because he's not actually trying to make me feel bad. He really means it when he says I'm beautiful without make-up and all that other stuff.

It was Christmas at my family's house, and my girlfriend decided to start calling my brother extremely hurtful names, and threw some very hurtful details about his personal life straight out on the table in front of the new girlfriend.

She went so far as to make my brother cry with what she did; and the worst thing of it all is that I had to explain to her that what she did was incredibly and inconsolably wrong.



Now, I have to state that I do love this girl. We've been together for a bunch of years now, and I know she has a tendency to throw a tantrum fit. However, the nature (arguing about something irrelevant), the timing(during christmas with everybody there), the intensity (telling very deep and emotionally hurtful things) and the target (my brother who I love more than anything in the world), makes it incredibly difficult for me to forgive her, no matter how hard I try.


To make matters worse, despite having had quite a bit of girlfriends, I have never actually broken up with anyone in my life. I have left, emigrated, fled, intentionally destroyed relationships, etc.

Now, I am living together with this girl and I see no way out, and I'm not even sure whether this one outburst also suddenly warrants termination of the relationship...

I was seriously depressed for over five years and often thought of suicide.,tspike,105,31,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dz2sv/i_almost_married_a_girl_with_severe_ocd_i_was/,"We were high school sweethearts, she was physically gorgeous, had a very kind heart, and loved me for who I was, not who she wanted me to be. 

She would wash her hands until blood started streaming down from them. Most of the time she was so wrapped up in her fears that communication was utterly impossible. She would slam drawers shut for an hour until it sounded ""right."" I often had to reassure her (""do you swear on your mom's life?"" ""do you swear on my life?"" ""how do you know? are you sure?"") for hours on end. I sold personal belongings, worked extra hours, then took leave from work to take her to an out of state intensive treatment center for eight weeks. She learned the tools she needed to fight her OCD, so I booked our wedding.

Things were going mostly OK, but then I was leaving therapy and saw 17 missed calls and 14 text messages, all from her family, and all demanding to know where I was. She was in the hospital. She tried to kill herself by overdosing on her antipsychotic medications. She was committed to a mental hospital for 3 weeks, and I was allowed to see her for only half an hour every day. I said I would stick by her as long as she promised to never miss a dose. She then stopped coming home, so I packed up my things, said my goodbyes, and moved out.

I cut off all contact with her. I was utterly alone, as my social circle had dwindled to almost nothing. My relationships with my family had deteriorated, and the only people I was close to (her family) were now unavailable. I moved into a house with strangers and had daily panic attacks. I committed myself to improving my social skills and to moving on with life, doing the things I always wanted to do when I was with her.

Things very, very, very slowly improved. I made some new friends. I had a few relationships with new women. I put myself into extremely awkward, uncomfortable situations on purpose and stuck with it, because I knew it would take that to get me to a better place. I got on my bike and rode it farther than I've ever rode it. I improved at skiing, and took up rock climbing. I stayed in therapy. I stitched together every acquaintance, every last hope of social contact into a patchwork social group. When that failed me, I would take a weekend trip to see someone from my past who lived elsewhere. Oregon. Chicago. Vail. Texas. Anywhere.

In the last month or two, I have really started to hit my stride. I went on a trip to Europe I'd been dreaming of for years. The size and quality of my social group has improved dramatically. I have much more energy and can get by happily with less sleep and less time by myself (I'm an introvert by nature). I met the most beautiful woman I've ever seen a few weeks ago, and now we're together and I'm quickly falling in love with her. I don't know what's going to happen. She's leaving town in January, which breaks my heart but I know I'll let her go without any fuss.

Months later I found out she was lying to me about how old she was, and then a few months after that, the cops came knocking on my door. Turns out the girl met a guy when she was out of state on a trip and had sex with him as well, but then he kept calling her phone and her parents asked why some guy from Alabama kept calling. She came clean about every guy she had hooked up with. Because it is a strict liability crime, I was not even allowed to mention the fact that she lied to the police, even though she admitted to it in the police report.

I spent 16 months in prison, lost my job and a bunch of my friends. It took me awhile to find a job, but I finally got something that at least has some semblance of being successful, it's not some crappy construction job or flipping burgers. But now that I have that hurdle cleared, I want to try to live the life of a normal 28 year old. I want to go out, date, do whatever, and not feel like people are judging me all the time.

I just start seeing this girl, and we've had a great time together. I feel like it's getting to be the right time to tell her about my past. The thing is she has a 5 year old daughter. I'm not really sure how this will effect our relationship, but I do feel like in general *any* sex offender is less likely to re-offend when they are in stable healthy relationships, but especially those like me who never wanted to do something illegal in the first place.

So does anyone (preferably female) have any advice on how I can tell her? How would you react or want to be told?

**edit: I'd like to thank everyone who has made me feel a little bit better about telling her. I've already gotten comfortable with the fact that if it's not something she can accept, then maybe she isn't the best person for me, since I'm going to need someone who will be there for me when things get tough.**

**For those of you who mention how upset situations like this make you, do me a favor and contact your local politician, both state and federal. I've always been outspoken about sex offender laws, even before I ever thought I'd be affected by them. But since this has happened I've become actively involved with groups trying to fight for meaningful change to these laws. I don't mind my privacy being a little invaded on if it means I can put a face to the effect these laws have on people who don't deserve it, but nothing is going to change until people who aren't sex offenders or related to them stand up to say that things as tey are right now are not right.**

We've known each other for nearly a decade been dating for four years and been serious and living together for three years.  We've been talking about marriage and kids for over a year now. I'm 31 and she's 27. 

She is a musician and is on the road with her band a lot.  We had one issue early in the relationship where she and her band mate started sexting and telling each other they loved one another.  I  left for a while and set up some boundaries. They've followed them and we got through it.  It actually made our relationship feel even more solid for a while. 

Up until a month ago when I got on her laptop to check for movie times (with her permission) a yahoo messenger came up with a message from some guy with the words 'spicy' and 'dick' in his username asking ""Where's my darling with that sweet pussy today?""  So naturally I read her past conversation log (without her permission) and apparently she has webcam sex on yahoo messenger.  I asked her about it and she says she gets lonely on the road and ""it's better than f*cking other people right?""  At the time I told her it's ok and I forgive her. She apologized and says she won't do it anymore.  

We have an otherwise amazing and supportive relationship in every other aspect and I love her a lot, but this coupled with the past indiscretion her band mate is making me question our future. I think I'm pissed. Any thoughts/suggestions? 

To any touring musicians out there: is the road really that lonely or this some stupid cliche excuse to sleep with your fans?

We dated for over 2 years. It was perfect. He has been the most kind, loving, supportive guy. We were so perfect for each other. Marriage was absolutely in the future, without a doubt. Kids, the whole thing. His parents are like my parents, and vice versa; we're all SO close. We have been nothing but happy this whole time. 

But last night, he sat me down. He told me that he had been having thoughts, since he was 16, of giving a guy a blowjob. It was like a  taboo fantasy of his. NO thoughts of kissing/having sex with/receiving oral from a guy. Just the one specific thing. He tried it when he was 16, he didn't like it. He had always been attracted to only girls, and still was. The thoughts continued, the thoughts were unpleasant and bothered him, plagued him. We met when we were 18, and dated until now. He never mentioned the thoughts, which apparently happen once a month, sometimes less. Yesterday he sat me down and told me he had these thoughts, and that on Monday he found someone on craigslist and went and gave them a blowjob. He said it felt disgusting and wrong, but he felt pressured to finish. He threw up afterward. He said it was ""taboo to him"", which is why he liked the thoughts. But doing it was not the same, he got no pleasure out of it. He said that usually he could get rid of the thoughts by masturbating to them, which is ok whatever. I don't understand why he couldnt just do that instead of going out and cheating on me. Or why he didn't tell me about these problems before he took it that far. He says it is not taboo anymore. He's having thoughts of hurting himself because of the guilt, he doesn't want us to break up. He says he loves me so much, I'm the one he is supposed to be with, he wants us to work it out. I'm shaking as I type this, even though it was over 12 hours ago. We talked for hours about it. We cried so much, it was awful. 

I'm hurt, sad, angry, and betrayed, and confused. He loves me so much, is full of guilt and regret. We have talked about going to therapy, for him especially, and couples therapy. Even if that were to somehow help him not have the thoughts, I don't know if I can get over this and continue to be with him in the same way, regardless if it never happens again. I am very, very guarded. He did it once, knowing what would happen if I found out, so just because it made things horrible doesn't mean he wouldn't do it again.  And it doesn't add up. He finds men not attractive to him, the idea of kissing one or having sex with a man is disgusting to him. He said the idea of giving a blowjob was taboo to him, and he liked the idea but did not like actually doing it. I have prodded him OVER and OVER, trying to get him to admit that he liked it, because then I would say ""ok you're bisexual and you cheated on me and enjoyed it, BYE."" but he swears he did not. I know how that sounds. But FOR NOW, I believe him. I am so sad and scared and confused. 

Part of me feels like I SHOULD give up and just not even go through anything else. But a bigger part of me doesn't want to. He's the love of my life. His family is my family. He is part of my family. I don't want anyone else. I want marriage in 5 years and kids in 10. I don't want to be alone. But I don't want that to be the only reason I stay, even though it wouldn't be the only one. It would be easier if he was like ""I fucked another girl and liked it."" Ok, BYE. ""I'm gay."" Ok, BYE. ""I enjoy having sex with and blowing men, but I'm also attracted to girls."" OK, BYE. But this is different. This is, ""I have thoughts only about giving a blowjob, and I enjoy the thoughts but hate actually doing it and am not attracted to men and don't want to do anything else with them."" The FUCK? Assuming he's telling the truth when he says it's just that one fantasy, he hated doing it, and that he's never been molested, WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM? I told my mom, but he refuses to get help from his parents, especially his dad. He's almost convinced to talk to his mom.

Should we try therapy? Am I delusional to even think that we could get help, move on from this and grow old together? How could we fix this, if at all? And WHAT is going on with my boyfriend? What the FUCK do I/we do now? I don't want to stay just because I can't be alone, or just because we've already invested so much, or for some stupid reason; I would NOT do that. I want to stay because we can get past it, and because we love each other. I'm just scared if I can love him in the same way. It's too soon to tell how it'll be in a week, a month, after months of therapy, in a year, etc. 

Please help. We spend the night together talking, we are on good terms right now. Now we are spending some time apart until we go home on Friday, so I can be with my mom and he can hopefully talk to his. I want to make this work. I don't know if we can, but at this point I want to. I just need perspective. I'm still in shock. That's where I stand. Please help.

EDIT: We are going to therapy tonight. He wants me there because he is scared to talk to the guy, so I won't say anything unless I'm asked to. For now, it's about HIM, and finding out why these thoughts have been bothering him so much. Then we can worry about the trust issues. It really does seem like a ""fantasy/fetish"" where the idea is infinitely better than the action itself. He is getting STD tested right now, but that will only give results from the high school encounter because the other one happened too recently. After the incubation period is up next week he can get tested from the one that happened on Monday. For the record, I was STD tested last summer (for ghonnorrea/chlamydia i think?), and both were negative. So far it seems the high school one might be safe, but who knows. Thank everyone SO much for the perspective and kind words. Keep 'em coming.

I asked several of the guys who did not know much about the subject. They then realized that one of their co-workers was going to school for helicopter technology and they called him up front. 

 He was gorgeous and very excited to be talking about thrust engines. He was very knowledgeable on the subject and even drew me a picture to describe how they work. I am in love with him. I know it seems really irrational, but you should know that this is not normal for me. I have been happily single for 8 months now and I have been in enough relationships to realize that you cannot let relationships or the lack of a relationship run your life. 

I thanked him for his help and said goodbye. I was in a hurry and really had no idea how to tell him that I liked him. He happened to draw the diagram on the back of his business card, which only has the business’s phone number on it. I stalked him on facebook, found his blog, and found out that we have many, many things in common. We have two mutual friends but they are more like my acquaintances. It also appears as though he is single. How do I go about approaching this guy? I have a few ideas and I could really use some advice since I never do this or feel this way about strangers. 



Idea one: get my oil changed at the body shop around the same time of day that I came in before and hope that he is working. Strike up a conversation.



Idea two: message him on facebook. This I am really struggling with. It seems like the easiest way but is totally stalkerish. 



Idea three: post a missed connections ad on craigslist (I might just do this any way)



I really hate all of these ideas just looking at them on paper makes them seem even more pathetic. Any help would be greatly
appreciated. 













edit: I know the difference between love and infatuation very well. I was using an expression of speech to add emphasis. My bad. 








**UPDATE:** I went in today around 5 after I got off and asked for him but he wasn't working today. I was pretty happy about this to be honest because I was super nervous to ask him out in person. I left a note on my card that said ""Thanks for explaining thrust engines to me, call me if I can pay you back with a drink or coffee sometime"".

When she came home, we talking about everything. I told her that I felt that she was emotionally cheating on me. I flat out asked if she had done anything physical with him and she adamantly denied it. I believe her.

She explained more about how she has lost the sense of closeness with me over the past couple months. She did not feel any spark or romance anymore. She said that she did not have any control over how she was feeling and that she did not see any way she could come back. She also explained that her feelings for the guy were more of just a result of her loss of closeness with me and not because she was looking for someone else or something. She said that it could have been anyone. Not that it negates the fact that she emotionally cheated, but that's how she explained it. I haven't forgiven her for it yet.

We decided to end it. She said that there was nothing I could have done and that she felt like she had no control over her emotions.
But it ended gracefully. We had been best friends for 2 years and we will continue to be best friends and to be there for each other. Oddly enough, we both felt closer to each other after we talked about everything than we had in a long time. We will still continue to be important people in each other's lives, but we will no longer be in a romantic relationship.

She tells me that she genuinely loves me but those feelings of me not being good enough (and thinking about how she wishes I looked/dressed like others) are still there. She says she shares deep emotional attachment with me, and doesn't want to break up and is asking for time so that she can get better.

My hairstyle - I've been losing my hair for a while now (Not full blown bald, but it's really thin) - that I can't do anything about.

She said she doesn't care for how I look anymore, she's way past that, but she wishes I cared a little bit more as she things I have a IDGAF attitude about everything. She apologized for the word ""ugly"" - she said she couldn't express her thoughts well 100% with English not being her first language. She also said she doesnt care at all if I change, because she sees herself as the one with a distorted view of me and she will try to change herself. However, I am willing to change what I can about me and be more motivated and take a lot more care in how I dress now because I think she's worth it.

We used to do it like rabbits or at the very least once a day. Now getting him to do it with me is like pulling teeth. It doesn’t matter when I ask him the excuses are always the same (I’m tired, I don’t feel well, I’m not in the mood right now). It bothers me because he’ll tell me “no” that night then go and look at porn then use his flesh light in the shower in the morning. 

I’m reduced to sex *maybe* once a week and that thing sees action almost every day. I know I know sex with a real woman is exhausting, messy, and can’t easily just be pumped up and down using your own hand but I thought I out ranked the damn thing at least.

I’ve tried discussing it and he doesn’t like talking about his flesh light. He used to have a clear one that was just a clear tube with bumps and no attempt at looking like a vag (it was a freebie we got with a purchase) now he has this ugly thing that I think looks like a vagina if they came as Happy Meal toys. It’s an odd chewed bubble gum pink in an unsightly gold casing. I used to love watching him use the clear one and asked him to let me watch him use the new one but he refuses, keeps it “hidden” away in the bathroom and in general acts like it doesn’t exists. He won’t even get it out when I’m around. 

I thought that time might be an issue at first since he likes AM sex, fresh from waking up (he gets up at 7AM to leave by 8). In the morning I’m not in a fit state to have sex (long list of reasons the shortest being: I’m on pills that mess with my stomach). He does get it every so often though, mostly on weekends. I LOVE evening sex. I’ve asked at different times. Regardless the time though he doesn’t want to do it. He’ll want to play computer games, it’ll be too hot, he’s too tired (and stays up reading until 1AM), he just doesn’t feel like it, etc. 

I’m to the point where I have to ask about it fairly far in advance like I’m penciling sex in. I have to say “I wanna have sex tonight.” Or “We’re going to have sex this week.” He decides from there. He never initiates it anymore.

TL:DR I suppose I’m just bitter that he’ll turn me down then in the morning go use his stupid toy. Especially since he won’t talk to me about it. 

Edit: We have a caring, happy relationship other than this. Our sex when we do have it is wonderful. Out side of the bed room things are well between us. We have mutual hobbies and our alone time. Normally we have good communication but this is one thing he doesn't like to discuss. 

It's not like I don't like him masterbating or using the thing ever, after all I own a vibrator myself, but I want more sex (or mutual action)

Is there a way I could bring this up with him that I haven't mentioned (in comments)? ",,True,,t5_2r0cn,1341331739.0,,,True,t3_vz7ix,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vz7ix/i_wanna_have_more_sex/,

He made me feel pretty bad about bringing it up and I know this is wrong. I have every right to protect myself by being honest. He told me all I have to do is just ask what his intentions are. 

He then went on to write a status about how anyone who believes chivalry is dead needs to take a look around them.


Am I over reacting by feeling a bit on edge?

",sadwifethrowaway,84,14,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/t9qhk/husband_may_have_undiagnosed_ptsd_i_think_i_want/,"I'm 24/F, him 25/M. We've been married for four years. No children, but 2 pups that I love like children.

When I first met my husband, Jason, he was a very kind man. He was empathetic, showed his emotions in the relationship well, and was an absolute blessing to my life. The most amazing thing that has ever happened to me. 

We got married while he was in the USMC. During his first deployment overseas, he didn't see any ""action"" but still came home (In early 2009) with a few re-adjustment issues. It came to a boiling point when he decided to pack up all of his stuff while I was at work, and move to a friend's house without telling me. He went off to training and while there we talked it out and he said he was coming home. On the day he was supposed to come home, he shows up drunk, telling me he doesn't love me and he doesn't want to be with me anymore. 2 days later he comes home. 

We start working on our relationship and things are going well as he's getting ready for his second deployment. He left, then returned early 2011. At this point his enlistment was just about up, and we were scrambling trying to move to our hometown, find him a new job, etc. finally things physically settle down, but emotionally they take off.

I'll start by saying he has never once been violent with me, but living with him emotionally has been draining. When we first got settled in, he seemed almost completely devoid of emotion. There was no positive emotion or negative emotion. Any affection I gave him was reciprocated with the least amount of effort, and I began to get frustrated. My frustration and anger caused him to lash out in anger and we spent most of our time together fighting about petty bullshit. 

It all came to a head when, one night, I was so upset at how he had treated me that day that I was laying in bed crying. He asked me why I was crying, I said I didn't want to talk about it and he went into the bathroom, and slammed the door. That made me cry even harder, and he came out of the bathroom and we got into a huge fight. By the end we were exhausted and just fell asleep with no resolution. The next day I told him that I wasn't sure how much longer I could deal with his aggression. He decided that he wanted to work on himself, but in order to do that he couldn't live with me. This completely fucked us financially. We had to cut the lease short on our apartment, and he had to pay additional rent to the guy he was moving in with. I moved back in with my mother. 2 weeks later he was living with me at my mom's (this was in December 2011).

In February '12, we found a house to rent. But nothing has changed. He gets mad over the most stupid things. If I'm trying to tease him or play around and lighten the mood, he completely dismisses me or tells me to knock it off. If he's being rude and I call him out on it, he manipulates it so that I'm the bad guy. He's constantly pissed off about something. If we fight and I cuss, he'll completely interrupt me to tell me not to cuss at him. Turn the whole argument around into how I cussed at him. 

Since his return from his second tour, he's been so bigoted and hateful towards others. He finds a reason to hate everybody. If he sees gay people on TV, he'll yell ""FAG"" or something else derogatory. Nobody is good enough for him. He has become so racist. He acts like other people are below him. He was never like this before. He was happy, he loved meeting new people and was never rude towards strangers. I'm such an empathetic person and when he says things like that about other people, it pains me and makes me so angry and uncomfortable. He just doesn't get that it's inappropriate. Just talking in the car one day, I asked him, ""You know I'm not, but how would you feel if I was pregnant?"" He told me, ""I'd pray for a miscarriage."" It makes me sick just thinking about it. Maybe I asked for it in asking that question, but I was really upset. He said he was just joking, but I don't think that's very funny at all.

I'm just so sad and heartbroken. It feels like the man I loved when I first got married is gone. It tears me apart to think about leaving because I do love him so so much. I just... I don't even know anymore. When I think about him or I being with someone else, it makes me sick to my stomach. If I left him, I don't know where I'd go, where my dogs would go. I just want to be happy with him. How can I be happy loving him, when he's just a cold, hateful shell of who he used to be? I'm so lost.

First time on here. Eek! Anyway...

I'm 33. My SO is 31, and I've been with her about 4 months. I'm just not falling in love with her. I don't know if I'm going to, and if I should just give up on the idea of falling in love properly again.

All this is majorly confused by issues surrounding parental abandonment (my mother moved to the other side of the world when I was 15; I've seen her a couple of times since but otherwise have no contact with her) and still having feelings for an ex. 

I've been deeply in love twice and neither time it's worked out; they just didn't love me as much. One moved to the other side of the world (yeah, Freud, I know) and the other moved a way away for work and I got terrible fear about it ending anyway and wasn't ready to give up all my ""stuff"". Stupid. But that's another story.

I'm wondering if falling in love is really realistic any more. When I have, it's been great, and very passionate, and felt like nothing else on earth. But I ended up getting hurt and taking a long, long time to get over it. Maybe love like that burns out very quickly?

My current SO is lovely - supportive, a great friend, attractive, nice to spend time with. I have an issue with the amount she drinks (fairly regular binges) but that's more because I don't do anything like that any more than any prudish anti-alcohol thing. I don't like her smoking, and she's said she'd give up but never managed to, and that's just about the way it makes her hair smell and the nasty kiss taste. Oh, and the things which niggle me a little about her make my best (female, married) friend absolutely detest her. But she's never approved of any of my relationships. I don't think she ever will.

Thing is, she really likes me, and sees us having a future. I don't, but because I don't love her yet. Maybe in enough time I will. Maybe I don't need to; maybe in time it would just grow into a decent enough, not passionate but therefore simple long-term thing built on friendship.

So, the question is: settle with someone who's a good friend but not the love of my life, hope that love follows and if not at least I have something stable and OK; or end it, wait for true love again, and possibly never end up with what I want?

**TL;DR: I feel like I'm getting too old to find true love, and besides true love ends, and ends badly. Settle for someone?**

*edit: lots of you saying therapy re: mother issues. Second session is tomorrow morning. My brother gets married next year, so I have to see her again, so I figured I'd better deal with it ;)

Also, thanks all for the replies.*

1318951935.0,72,self.relationship_advice,lgcy3,S.O. weight gain makes sexual attraction difficult,soweightproblems,98,26,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/lgcy3/so_weight_gain_makes_sexual_attraction_difficult/,"I have been with my girlfriend for a little over two years.  She was heavy when we started dating but not overweight and she was working out regularly.  However since that time she has steadily gained weight and become very inconsistent with working out.

About nine months ago I asked her to please start trying to lose weight and work out for her health.  She agreed that she probably should and that she would start watching her food intake and workout regularly.  I offered to help her in anyway that she might need.  She preferred to keep me completely in the dark about what she was doing.

Since then I would try to ask her about her weight from time to time because it seemed like she was continuing to gain weight.  She always responded with either crying or getting mad and leaving the room and then crying.

She has continued to gain weight steadily.  This past weekend I decided I needed to talk to her about the issue.  It turns out that she is happy with her weight and thinks that she is healthy.  Her blood pressure and such is always okay with her yearly physical.  It also turns out that we met at a thin point for her weight and she usually weighs about what she weighs now.  Since it was clear that she felt that she is healthy I, as politely as possible, let her know that her weight was making it difficult for me to be attracted to her physically.

It was a big surprise to me that she is okay with her weight.  She can be very vain when it comes to her age (she is 28), wrinkles and other things that it is not really possible to control.  She talks about planning on having plastic surgery when she is older.  She also refuses to have her picture taken.

We live about an hour and a half apart and generally only see each other on weekends.  I have never asked but she has probably gained about fifty pounds over the past two years.  Enough that she has had to purchase new clothes a few times, and fat rolls are clearly visible when she is clothed.

Other than the weight issue she is smart, kind, considerate and loving.  Since she is okay with her weight it is really my issue and therefore I'm afraid she will resent me for wanting her to lose weight.  I also feel like a jerk for being superficial; I've never had this issue before and have loved woman of a large range of beauty.  I am attracted to the person first and their looks second.  However, she has gained so much weight that I have become somewhat grossed out by her body which has lead to severe issues with intimacy and is starting to spill over into other areas of our relationship.  

Sex now feels like a chore to me and neither one of us is getting off.  I used to be able to get her off, through intercourse, three or four times each round.  Now I am not motivated as seeing her body is an instant turn off.  I have difficulty maintaining an erection or caring to thrust for more than a few minutes at a time, which is not long enough to get either of us off.  A lot of positions are more difficult now, she refuses to get on top and we can't do some of the things we used to because I'm not strong enough with her added weight.

I've never thought of anyone else besides my current partner while having sex before but now I am sometimes forcing myself to so that I can get off and finish inside of her.  I feel pressured to get off inside of her because she puts so much emphasis on it happening and takes it as a sign of my love, caring and desire for her.

It might be possible that what I do to maintain my level of fitness intimidates her.  I was a fairly successful runner in high school and college and continue to run heavily today.  I absolutely do not expect her to be as fit as I am.  I just want her to be more attractive and healthy.  I'm afraid she is overly stressing her body as she is already having issues with her knees and back.

Am I jerk for asking her to lose weight or is it reasonable to expect a significant other to maintain a certain level of attraction?  How do I talk to her about this?

Please help me.,needhelpbad1122,82,11,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/in0qt/spouse_is_emailing_nude_pics_to_some_guywtf/,"As the title said, I discovered my spouse of 10 years is emailing nude pics of herself to some dude on the other side of the country. 

The Story;
I stumbled upon her vibrator in a suspicious spot the other day, and part of me thought it would be hot as hell to find out what the hell she was getting off to. So, my dirty little mind started doing a little investigation and I found a couple of nude pics of herself still open on her laptop. I thought ""wtf?"", but then I remembered her telling me she was going to send me some dirty pics a couple of months back, and then chickened out. She has recently gotten a new laptop and she barely uses the old one very much (if it all) since then, so I chalked it up at the truth.

She went out tonight, and I needed to borrow her new laptop and when I opened it up, she still had her gmail open. I noticed a lot of emails between her and this guys she had told me she almost never speaks to. Without reading any of the mails, a hunch led me to search her mail for his name, then I noticed a bunch of attached files she had been sending him. Pretty much the first email I opened was a few nudes shots of herself. In fact, they were the ones I found on her laptop earlier. These pics go beyond anything she has ever sent me, and go way beyond porn.

After a little more hunting I found about a dozen similar emails she had sent before last Christmas.

My blood pressure went ape shit, and has been pounding ever since. 

In a mad attempt to hide my actions I sent her a text that I was using her new laptop. She logged out of gmail almost immediately. I managed to save 2 of the original files before i got kicked.

I check over her old laptop to find the original pics, but she deleted them yesterday. I downloaded a couple of recovery programs, but for some reason they aren't picking up the incriminating evidence.

The Dilemma, 

  What the hell do I do? 

  She was probably only jerking off with this guy so I am not entirely sure if it counts as cheating. I definitely don`t want it to continue and I feel betrayed and emotionally destroyed.

  I really really love her, and I am terrified that if I call her out on it, our whole relationship is going to go to the pots.

  How the hell can I point the finger at her if I was snooping through her private email? Its pretty fucking hard to call her untrustworthy when I myself was committing a huge breach of trust. 

  Reddit, I really need help on this. I am totally beside myself and I truly can't think of what to do. Please help me.

**Edit:Update 1;** Thank you guys for your kind words. It's really helping me cope with this. It's 1:30am my time, and I expect her in at 2:00. I already emailed the other guy to say ""btw, she and I have been together for over 10 years.... in case you didn't know"" which I don't think he did. I cc'd her on the email so I am sure she is texting and emailing the other fella to explain herself, which is why I am getting no replies to my texts.

My nerves have finally started to calm down a little, and I truly think its because of all your helpful replies. I was pretty close to the brink when I wrote the original email. I've smoke an entire pack of cigarettes since I got home, and I have stocked up on 2 more for tomorrow, lol. Its going to be a long night. I will keep you posted when I can.


**Edit 2** 8:00am; well we talked from about 2 till a little while ago and it was a bit of a rage fest on my part. It's been  a long night and I need sleep, so I'll post more later..but we are trying to work on it.

**Edit 3 - Final Update** Well, thanks everyone..you were all a really big help to me. We talked from about 2am to 7, then slept for an hour, and talked again until after 12. We are going to go into couples counseling, and she is also going to go see a private therapist. Some of the issues which came up were a severe feeling of depression on her part which we both agreed needed to be dealt with. The couples counseling is to deal with the obvious trust issues I now have and some other issues we discussed in our relationship.

Thank you again for everything. Last night I was a total mess, and I am glad I had somewhere to turn. Weird that I turned to Reddit, lol, not the most private spot.

This is a one shot account, because frankly I'm kind of embarrassed by all this. Hopefully I can return the favor to someone else.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_in0qt,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/in0qt/spouse_is_emailing_nude_pics_to_some_guywtf/,
1307465434.0,73,self.relationship_advice,htuv7,I have definitive proof that my girlfriend is cheating on me. Now what?,detective_in_love,87,14,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/htuv7/i_have_definitive_proof_that_my_girlfriend_is/,"**The setup**

So I've been with this girl for 3 months now. We have a great relationship, we see each other almost everyday and stay for the night at my apartment almost every night. Since she is almost always at my place, she leaves her laptop on the living room table. Usually she chats with her friends on messenger or Facebook or by SMS while we watch TV. She don't really care if I can see what they are chatting about. But other times she is more secretive, and I respect that because I trust her. Yesterday she received a message from one of her good guy friend. He is a guy she works with sometimes and they have been friends since before I known her. That guy is married and has children (this is important). The message was, literally, ""I want your ass"". I ignored it, thinking he might be joking. But then my girlfriend started to chat with him, and would always minimize the messenger window each time she sent a message. And when she was receiving a new message (the icon in the taskbar glowing orange), she didn't open it immediately. She would ask me things like ""can you go get something"" or ""can you start the movie"", so when I stand up she could check the message and answer before I sit back next to her. So anyway, I managed to see a part of the conversation and it looked like they were flirting hard. I should have ask her or confront her about it but she clearly didn't want me to see that and I thought I was just imagining things. Later she just turned off her computer saying ""I'll turn this off, right now I'm with you!"" This is, I think, the first time she did this. Usually she would always have her Facebook open ""just in case"". But then she started to send text on her phone. And she was as secretive as with messenger. I managed to see two messages she received, from that same guy: ""where are you now?"" and ""at lunchtime?"" I was more and more suspicious. She was also more ""loving"" than usual. Little kisses, hugging me a lot. It was different. Later we took a bath together and she talked about him, how he was a good friend and other things. It was not the first time so I ignored that too. She can have good guy friend, right?

This morning she chatted with him again but they were talking business and she didn't hide anything from me this time. She usually wear makeup, but today she took a longer time to prepare. She looked as beautiful as when she goes out on the weekend. I actually mention it to her but she just didn't seem to mind that. Then she left.

**The proof**

I'm all for privacy in a relationship, and to trust my girlfriend, but this morning it was too much. Her laptop was there on the table, I had to be sure. So I check her messenger history. Shame on me. But strangely, it was almost empty. There was only her conversation of this morning. At first I was kinda relived because I feared I would stumble upon things that I didn't want to see. But then I noticed that the recycling bin was full. I looked at it and there it was, the history folder. Copied it from her laptop to my computer, took a shower to calm myself before starting to read, and then I read it. It was not a long history. It seems that she is deleting it from time to time. So I got straight to that guy's history and started to read. And there it was, the final proof that I needed. With all the sexy details, and the fact that they missed their chance to have sex this weekend and how my girlfriend wanted to fuck him that night. It was all there. From what I understand, they were having a affair from before I was in relationship with her. I don't care what happened before our relationship, it's not of my business. But she can't continue to fuck that guy while we are together.

**Now what?**

Now I don't know what to think or do. I was not suspicious of them since the guy was married and had kids. But now I remember all the time that my girlfriend was acting weird when talking about him. How she told me he was cheating on his wife and how it was ""so stupid"" and how she would never have sex with that guy. I want to forgive her but I just can't let that be without talking to her about it. And of course I can't tell her that I read her messenger history. She's guilty of cheating on me but now I'm guilty of spying on her. But even without the messenger history, I still have her suspicious behavior and secret chats and texts to confront her. What should I do?


**tl;dr** : I was suspicious of my girlfriend cheating on my. I looked at her messenger history for proof and found out I was right. How can I talk to her about it without reveling that I look at the history? I still love her and I still want to be with her but I don't know what to do.


**Update**

So just before coming here, she tells me she got robbed at her apartment. I didn't feel like comforting her anymore. So I talked to her when she got here. I was not feeling well. I told her we had to talk and hugged her. My feelings were all messed up. So we sat down and after some time I tell her about yesterday, how I was not comfortable with her talking sex with her friend and hiding it. She tells me that that guy talk sex with all the girls. I told her that she was talking a lot about him, etc. She tells me that she would never sleep with that guy, because he has a wife and kids. So I tell her more specific stuff, like how she told him that ""last time was perfect"" while they were talking sex yesterday. Then she says that yes, they had sex in the past but it was some time ago, and that yes, it was good. (seeing a contradiction here?) At that point I wanted to forgive her. Maybe I was mistaken? Maybe she wanted to have sex with him last weekend but didn't because of me. Then she was less calm, she accused me of not trusting her, that I didn't want her to go out with her friends, etc. Then she tells me that she should just take her stuff and leave forever. Telling me things like ""you realize you're losing me because of this?"" and I said that I didn't want that. But it was to late, she gathered her stuff (all while blaming me about it, laughing because I made a big thing out of that, saying I was stupid to have told her that just when she got rubbed, that I took ""Internet jokes"" as a real thing, etc). I was really sad. I wanted to tell her to change her mind. But at the same time I wanted to tell her that I knew about the messages where she tells him that she wanted to have sex with him, etc. But didn't. Then she left.

I don't feel so bad about it now. I think her last action, to take her stuff and leave, was the last proof I needed to be done with it. She didn't even seem to care. Like she was not loving me at all. She was mad about it, saying she was with me everyday for a week now and that there was no way she would have cheated on me, etc.

I guess I will know how I really feel about it in a couple of days.


**Update 2**

I wrote her a big message on Facebook right when she left. I told her why I was upset and why I asked her about that. Mostly what I felt about yesterday. And I told her everything I knew about her and her friend. I told her it was clear that she was in love with him but couldn't be with him because of his family, and that she was dating me to forget. And I told her I was always trusting her but this time it was too much. Etc.

She texted me back later to tell me that I was right about her loving him and that she was dating me to forget. She told me that she was really falling in love with me. But she ended her message with ""too bad!"" Then she told me that if I had never been snooping, I would have never know about it, she would have forgotten him, and we would be happy now.

Now that I know all that, I kinda feel better. She really is trying hard to deny her fault. At the same time I'm sad that she didn't talk to me about it before our relationship.

Update Post : [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bgja1/updates_i_cheated_but_at_what_point_do_i_deserve/)

Hello RA, It's been a few months. I'd just like to say right away that you all helped so much.  **WALL OF TEXT (as always)**

Well it's 6 months after I found out my Wife had been cheating and a lot has changed. After finding out the first thing I did was get the kids DNA tested. Then I spent the next two weeks sleeping on the couch and having endless conversations with my wife. The more we talked the more I felt like the world's biggest chump. I had poured my soul into fixing the relationship and was wracked with guilt while she was out fucking some guy. 

But I also couldn't see myself just walking away. She'd been in my life since we were 15 (we are 29). So I agreed to start therapy immediately and see how I felt after talking to someone else. To say the therapist was a bit shocked by our story is a bit of an understatement. This lady was pretty blunt in saying that nearly all of our problems stem from my Wife’s actions and she needed counseling just for her, in addition to the couples session.  While we were in therapy I moved out and crashed with my best friend but demanded the house on the weekend so I could be with the kids. 

My other ‘conditions’ were that she cut off all contact with ‘Steve’ and that we talk openly about everything. Any lies, even white lies and I would be done. I also wanted full control of the bills/budget. She complied. I never divulged that it was a keylogger that helped me find out what was going on, she just assumed that she had stayed logged into her secret gmail account and I didn’t correct her. (Asshole move, but I figured that since I’d been lied to for 3+ years I had the right to do a bit of spying). 

This puts us at roughly 4 weeks after I found out and finally the results from the kids DNA tests come back. ALL MINE! That was such a relief that I can’t even describe it. It almost felt like I didn’t care what happened with my wife anymore because I knew my kids were mine and I’d always have them. And one thought stuck in my mind the whole time was “I can accept that people make mistakes, but if she loved me she had the chance to come clean about her mistake when she caught me… instead she put me on lock down for years. Who does that to someone they love?”. I just could stop thinking about that. 

Therapy was going well, but I was becoming jealous and angry. Always upset. I was away from home all week and then on the weekend I’d tear apart the laptop trying to find out what she’d been doing in my absence. She was checking her secret email and Steve was continuing to email her but she never responded.  That was the breaking point. She hadn’t shut down the email like I had asked and while she wasn’t responding she was checking the emails. Almost like she was keeping her safety net around so she could go back if things didn’t work out. Or maybe not, I don’t know. But I didn’t want to be an angry and jealous all the time. I didn’t want to be a warden. 

The next day I confronted her and told her I couldn’t forgive what she had done. I told her I could probably move past the cheating, but the way I was treated was terrible. I explained how I had pushed friends out of my life and shut myself off from the world to work on ‘us’ only to find out I was being kept prisoner so she could keep fucking her boytoy.  She broke down crying saying she’d do anything to salvage the relationship, but it fell on deaf ears. 

That Monday I contacted an attorney. Fast forward 4.5 months and I have my own place, divorce is nearly final and I'm finally starting to feel like ‘me’ again. We are going for 50/50 custody. I’ve been reconnecting with friends and trying to find new hobbies for when I don’t have the kids. I’ve been on 2 dates because a couple friends wanted to double date, thinking it would help me. It was nice to meet new girls, but I’m just no where near ready to trust anyone. Part of me thinks I’ll just put off dating until the kids are out of HS. The kids are sad that we aren’t together but we keep all of this away from them. No arguing in front of them and no bashing the other when they aren’t around. 

But either way I think I'm on the road to recovery. And feel free to ask anything, because you guys helped more than I could ever say. 

Tl;dr – I'm now a pornstar.  (no)

I just go a text from some woman I don't recognize. It must have been for my wife since the only difference between our mobile numbers is that mine ends with 9 and hers ends with 8. It says, ""Does the schmuck still think you're working overtime? Love, Marcella and Ken"".

I don't want to believe that my wife is cheating on me with another couple, but what the fuck am I supposed to think? I know these people. I've had dinner with them. I don't want to believe this, but what choice do I have?

**Summary**

I'll give the summary first, because this is going to be long. I've been married for ten years. She's become a workaholic. When I asked her what was wrong, she broke my heart by telling me she doesn't give a damn about my feelings. The woman I love only exists in my own memories and imagination, and somebody else now wears her face.

**Long Version**

We've been married for ten years. We faced everything together, we talk about everything, we don't keep secrets, and we still have an active sex life (at least 3 times a week). However, things changed a few months ago. We both moved to a new city and took new jobs. My attitude towards work has always been that I should do the job, get paid, and go home. I never work overtime unless I'm getting time-and-a-half, unless I fucked up and need to fix it.

My wife has a different attitude towards work. She gets obsessed with it. She won't put it aside unless she has to. It was never really an issue before because she worked in places where she couldn't bring work home with her, and couldn't remain *at* work once it was time to lock the place up. But this new job is different. She brings work home and stays up until five in the morning. She stays at the office until 10 or 11 at night, calls me to pick her up, and expects me to sit there and wait for her while she ""finishes one more thing"". She doesn't drive, and has no desire to learn or get her license.

I talked to her about it this weekend, and told her that I felt neglected. I feel like she doesn't have time for me any longer, as she thinks about nothing but work and only initiates conversations with me when she wants me to do something for her. We're having sex almost every night, but it's strictly perfunctory, as if she was using my penis as a sleeping pill. There's no love or foreplay any longer; she just wants me to lube it up, get it hard, and put it in. 

She won't read anything I've written any longer, even though it was my writing that brought us together. I've told her that I'm unhappy with the situation, and asked if there was something *I* did to make her feel the need to seek refuge in her work and let her employer take advantage of her. She's pulling eighty-hour weeks and hardly getting any sleep, with no end in sight, and no compensation for her time and effort.

I told her I was worried about her, because I don't recognize the woman I've loved for ten years. The face is the same, but there's a cold workaholic behind the brown eyes that used to gaze into mine while we made out in the rain.

I asked her to tell me what was wrong, and she said, ""Why are you bothering me? I don't have time to give a shit about your feelings. I have work to do. Either make yourself useful or fuck off.""

I fucked off. I took my laptop, a week's worth of clothing, and spent last night at a motel. I tried to go to work this morning, but left after lunch because I hurt too much to be able to think straight.

I still love her. At least, I love the woman I used to know. But I don't know this woman any longer. I'm looking for a good attorney now, even though I feel like I'm abandoning her because I can drive and she can't. We don't have any kids, and we've always kept our finances separate.

Hi, everyone.

I'm not sure if any of you remember/care about the last post I made on this account, but for those who do... my girlfriend left me. She sent me a letter that I just got today.

She doesn't explain herself in the letter, but she has said that she'll tell me why she's leaving me when she feels brave enough to.

She signed the letter with ""please forgive me."" While I can't know for sure if that means what I think it means, I feel like she cheated on me with ""Jim."" Last time I went to visit her she asked me how I felt about people who cheat on other people... just sort of putting two and two together.

Anyway. Sorry to take up space, but... I'm kind of a wreck, and I can't have any sort of closure with her until she contacts me.

Someone please tell me that I'll be okay.

EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to every single one of you. You've helped me get from ""sobbing mess"" to ""occasionally cracking a smile"", and all in under an hour. I'm still definitely feeling rough around the edges, but it's nice to know that people on the internet can have heart. You're all wonderful.

I have posted in the past about my abusive relationship but now it just took a turn for the worst.

It started last night where I wanted to sleep early (10PM) due to lack of proper sleep the previous night ( I was re-organizing the apartment and have a small chat (less than 5 mins) with a buddy via FB); so as I proceeded to sleep yesterday night, she threw a mini-tantrum in bed claiming that I ""have time to stay up all night on FB talking to *girls* and don't have enough time for me and my needs!"" So after not getting enough sleep **again** today, I woke up groggy &amp; late to get ready so decided to take my clothes and shower at my parent's pad and walk to work instead. 

She went with me to my parent's pad to use the PC (we don't have one/Internet at our place) so I said OK. I was in a frustrated mood due to lack of sleep and was mostly quiet in the car trip from LA. Fast forward after eating breakfast, I got the laptop out from my parent's room and was en route to work and just when I was to say goodbye to my gf, she told me: ""oh so you know I'm here! You ignored me on the car trip and last night!""  So she stormed off and when I was chasing her, I told her I was simply tired/frustrated due to lack of sleep and nothing against her at all. So out of anger, she punched me in the street corner in front of people claiming she's tired of my excuses; and out of pain, I called her a bitch and walked hunched-over to work. 

As I was en route to work again, she ran up from behind me and told me she was over with me, and forcing me to go back to my parents and tell them I'm (and I quote from her own words:) ""an asshole."" So I said NO and she threatened me that when I go back home to LA, she won't be there, all my stuff would be trashed. So I told her that I'm going to call the police and she told me: **""who are they going to believe in domestic abuse? You over a woman?!""** and then walked away.

The time I got to work, I was late and almost got fired today.

**tl;dr:** 
My anger-problem ridden gf just assaulted me in a street with people witnessing it, I can't call anyone for help, my personal items at home is in danger of getting ruined, and I'm afraid I have dug a grave for myself.

Part of me still like her but I'm both mentally and physically scarred from now on and in dire need of any help but my issue might not be taken into consideration and swept under a rug.

**Additional info:** 
If she leaves, the apt is under both our names and it'll ruin both our credits, as well as not enough $$$ to balance the bills.

Now I'm kicking myself.,throwaway-2457,90,18,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/180gi6/27f_casually_asked_my_boyfriend27m_i_met_2_years/,"I asked him this on friday(2-1-13) and he has not answered me (it's wednesday 2-6-13). He looked paralyzed with fear. 

Background. We are living together for about a year now. We both don't have or want children (had this convo when we started having sex). Neither of us have been married before. We can usually talk about anything. He's the man I want to spend my life with and he tells me he wants to spend his life with me. There's trust, love, and respect. 

When we began dating he'd make jokes about past girlfriends wanting to ""tie him down"" how they'd want him to say ""The L Word"" right away and when his ex got married he said ""dodged the bullet with that one!"" Though this sounded like an odd way to communicate I still respected his boundaries. I was sensitive to allow him to move the relationship forward on his terms. 

So we dated about a year, and he had not wanted to really commit to much. I figured he was not into the long term. I decided to leave. I really did like him but I didn't see it going anywhere. I told him so. To my surprise he asked me to move in with him, so I did. Soon after he started saying he loved me. 

Fast forward a year later, we are in love and committed to one another, I think I know his heart but want to be on the same page as him... Blam! I come at him with this. I told him it wasn't a big deal, I wouldn't break up with him, I am asking only for clarification not his hand. Sheesh. I feel as surprised about this as I was when he asked me to move in with him. Wondering if this is turning into a pattern. I feel like I'm pulling him into this kicking and screaming. Again.

**tl;dr**

Steady relationship, open communication, asked if he sees himself ever getting married to anyone, met with silence.


**edit** Thanks for all your responses, I'm reading all of them even if I don't respond to each. I'm confidant now that my question wasn't unreasonable. His reaction was what unsettled me and made me insecure. I plan on talking with him tonight and hopefully come to some conclusion. He's really awesome in every other aspect so I'd like to keep him around. 

**edit 2, an update** So we sat down for a heart to heart last night and I made my ideas known. Like a lot of you said, my question wasn't unheard of and I let him know that his reaction was unsettling and unwarranted and asked for an explanation. 

His response: 
* His last girlfriend of three years was constantly trying to get him to marry her. She was married before him and got married about 5 months after they broke up. (So it becomes clearer why he went all deer in the headlights. I really tried not to take offence at this. Yeah, I'm not his ex, but apparently that was pretty hard on him.) 
* Almost his entire family has experienced broken marriages (not his parents, but relatives) 

After he was done explaining his reaction I told him it's not right to lump me in with people he didn't respect. I understand now the word marriage is a trigger for him. He heard me say it that first night and nothing I said could have stopped his mind from reeling into the past.  He said ""marriage was not completely out of the question, but I am still going to deer in the headlights next time you bring this up"". So, while I accept his answer about his view of marriage, I told him flat out that ""deer in the headlights"" reaction was never acceptable. When we fight it's okay to take a step back and cool off... but never revisiting the issue is detrimental.

**tl;dr His ex traumatized him, he's still sensitive. While we didn't take marriage off the table, we are both still a ways off. Told him I didn't want his ex determining the level of our relationship or hindering our communication.   He agreed.**

I hope to revisit this with him again but I plan on taking it slow. It's obviously a big deal, I'd like to desensitize him so his ex-girlfriend-husband-hunter stops affecting my otherwise functional relationship. jeez.

Basically I have a roommate who is amazingly hot, funny, and while her tastes run more conventional than nerdy she still seems to enjoy alot of the same movies, shows, and games that I do. Before meeting up with her I had assumed I was gay (had a few past trists).

For about two weeks now, she has crawled into bed with me, and snuggled. She is coming out of a relationship where ""She loved him but he only loved her kids and didn't want to be with her"" and another where she fell for a friend of mine who is divorced but still loves his wife.

The night before last she sent me some texts:
http://imgur.com/a/dmklb

So I was her date to her brothers wedding last night, I drove us home. We talked about how complicated her love life is, I mentioned that I have no advice to give, because I'm terrible at reading people.

Anyway, she mentioned wanting to grab some snacks. We stopped at wally world, and picked up some funions and Doritos. She got home, and we did a few shots of Southern Comfort. Nothing that got either of us drunk just to relax. We then spooned together and watched 2 movies together until we fell asleep together.

In the morning, we woke up spooning still, I was hard as a rock. She moaned slightly and rolled so she could pull her arm around her shoulders and onto her chest.

Normally when we lay together, I lay with my hand on her stomach and let her use my other arm as a pillow. After she moved my one hand, I slid the other to her thigh.

Well from there basically we started getting each-other out of our pajamas and what I thought was taking us to sex, instead lead to a hand job. (which felt awesome) but she didn't want me to reciprocate. 

All throughout this I have had trouble because, with Aspergers, I like to operate within clear boundaries of behavior. I usually err on the side of caution. From my former experience and what I've seen online, it seems like surely she should want me to reciprocate right?

Did I do something wrong? Was this a reward? I'm really confused now. ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_yh3cp,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yh3cp/m28_with_aspergers_laid_in_bed_with_roommate/,

Girlfriend and I are both in college 21, been dating 8 months. Our relationship has been long distance over the summer she lives about 5 hours away. However we have seen each other 3 weekends over the couple of months. Everything was going good, ready to get back to school with her. Well she has a trip planned to California to visit a few friends and was staying with one of her best guy ""friends"", who is in the military and has been out of the country for 2 years. I am not a huge fan of him but, I don't want to be that boyfriend. The one who doesn't let her do something so I let it slide. She says don't worry everything is going to be ok. Trust is most important thing in a relationship for me I am not going to stop her. 

So having to both check out of our Apartments at school, we decide to meet up at the university and spend a day together. I had to change my checkout time so i borrow her phone (left mine b/c i was wearing a bathing suit) I come across some texts she send to this ""friend"" that included ""wish you were hear to lay my head on you"", ""miss you I want to cuddle and Sleep with you"". She came in I asked her what it was about she responded with shock and then said she was planning on resolving her feeling while she was out their??? What the hell thought we were dating? 

My reaction to hug her tell we had a good run and end the relationship right then and there. I just don't think I can be with someone who would do that behind my back. So in my view she damaged the trust and the relationship is over. 9 days with this guy and you are going to cuddle...hmmmm.

Then I had to drive my ass back home another 3 hours. 

BTW We both live on the east coast so cali is a long way. She gave it all up for nothing. 

Long Day

Just wondering how some of you viewed this.

**Update**: I talked to her on the phone and as you could imagine she was a complete wreck, she said it as an ""escape"" from her normal life and the stress of her full time internship and stressful life She said nothing was every going to happen. ""She would take it all back if she could"", ""I was the best boyfriend she could ever ask for"" ""She gave it up for nothing"""" I love you so much"". Admitted she has gone behind my back and lied etc etc. I suppose it would be the standard stuff someone would say when something like this has happened. It was a fairly sad conversation for me as I had to tell her that there is no going back. She did dig her own grave on this one. Her words cannot rebuild the trust. I said as much ""as it breaks my heart we have to move on its time for goodbye"" 

I left the conversation feeling a bit better about myself having my the choices I did. It's hard to hear someone you loved just devastated, no matter the reason

About the snooping, I am one of those guys who will leave his phone out unlocked because I have nothing to hide and I can count the times I have seen texts on her phone in any fashion on less than one hand. I just had an uneasy feeling about it. Yes it was hypocritical I was breaking her trust in a way. However me finding out I am the one just being paranoid would be far easier for me to live with than what resulted. I felt it was worth it if you guys can understand.

It was an Iphone so it took all of just me seeing her text message preview to justify my suspicion.

Everyone that went to the stagette had to make a love letter for her hubby... and this was one of her drafts trying to be a sappiest sod for a prize.

Background.  Both in our 20s.  Live in the US.  I'm a girl. He's a guy.  We've been dating for 8ish months.

Everything about our relationship is wonderful (get along great, little fighting, love spending time together, great sex etc.) except for one thing.  He won't fulfill my fantasy.

I know this is going to sound really weird, but the idea of making a guy jizz in his pants has always turned me on.  

After a couple months of being together we started to tell each other our fantasies.  I mentioned that I wanted to make a guy jizz in his pants.  He seemed fine with it and even mentioned that he had jizzed in his pants from dry humping in the past.

But whenever I initiate a dry humping session, he refuses to go along with it.  I don't know what's wrong.  He'll be completely turned on and the minute I try to make him jizz in his pants he tells me he's ""tired.""  But if I try other stuff (sex, bj, hj), he's not too ""tired.""  I've tried talking to him about this both in bed and out of bed.  He just ignores me or laughs it off.

I'm getting really frustrated.  I've tried to act out all his fantasies (dressing up in all kinds of sexy costumes for him), but he won't do the one thing that turns me on the most.  I feel like this is really unfair. Why should I do what he wants in bed, if he won't do what I want?

Help me R_A.

Thanks for reading. Now then, some story.

I'm married to my first long-time (7.5 years) girlfriend for 3 years now, and a few days ago she became very quiet, stopped telling me that she loved me, and I managed to coerce out of her that she has indeed committed adultery. 
I can't say that it's a big surprise, as she's been a bit distant lately, but I've just pushed it away as ""pregnancy depression"" or something to that degree. 

The story is that the guy is someone she talked to on twitter, met for a coffee once, and then evolved into something of a crush/love-thing. Over a few months, they met when she was away on business trips and she admits to having real, deep feelings for him.
I do not know this man, I know his twitter-handle and his age (27/m), what he works as, but that's about it.

As I wrote earlier, we have an infant (6 weeks old), and that's what bothers me. If it wasn't for him, I think the story would be somewhat different. (and yes, he is my kid. She met this other guy 6 months ago)

I laid out some rules:

* Do NOT maintain contact with this other guy 
-   &gt;She claims that she's done this now. She cried herself to sleep last night, so I'm guessing she's telling the truth here

* Tell me whatever I want to know, whenever I'm ready for it
- &gt;This is how I know that they used protection, and how / when it happened
* Try making our marriage work. 
- &gt;This is a big thing, yes, but I think (and hope) we can get through it if we both work together.

So, tell me; those of you with more experience than me.. Did I do the right thing, or am I clasping at straws to try saving something that's lost forever?

Basic synopsis is that I [27/f] snooped on my SO's [33/m] laptop(s) after living together the past four years. We are in a serious DB situation and I wanted answers. Holy fuck did I get them. The usual porn, I know he's into big tittied white women so that was no surprise (I'm a petite, five foot tall Korean American woman). Recordings of webcam whores, also not surprising. A folder of his ex that he was engaged to and with for seven years containing pictures of her from within that past year, a little surprising, I didn't think they were in contact still. A folder with her name as the title filled with dozens of audio recordings between him and her having phone sex talking about how bad they were being behind ""the gook bitch"" and ""chink girlfriend"", not just surprising but repulsive. My heart broke with each file name I read, I didn't even need to hear them, I just read, shaking, in shock. He even took the time to rename and chop each phrase into individual audio files, and the racist shit wasn't even what sucked the most, it was the shit like ""I'd leave her for you"" and ""I love you"" right as he's about to cum. There was some financial domination involved as well and I will never know if he truly did pay her for that phone sex session. After finding all of that, nothing that I found afterwards was really any worse, except that he's into the whole Niteflirt thing and has paid for phone sex and Myfreecams tokens. I am realizing now that every person has the right to secrets, and having their own private parts of their lives, especially when it comes to masturbation in a DB relationship. However, at what point is this cheating and at what point is this financial secrecy? He's been open to me about wanting to be dominated, but our sex life before it died was always very much me being the sub and I figured I had some time to figure out how to become a ""switch"", not that he would reach the point where he had to go outside of our relationship - and even worse back to a prior one - to find sexual fulfillment. 

Some Background: 
Less than a year into our relationship we were pretty much in a DB situation, which I believe occured during a sexual encounter we had that involved him asking me if I would get tit implants while his dick was inside of me because he ""needs something to hold onto"". This one incident changed our sex life, the dynamic of our relationship, and my already faltering self-esteem. Slowly, our sex life faded into nothingness at about year three, which is when this phone sex incident with his ex went down. I was working full-time between two jobs, he wasn't working at all, and I was pretty depressed. We had a miscarriage right around this time, with a pregnancy that was unplanned. From this point on, we made the concsious decision to stop having sex (birth control with no health insurance was too expensive with me paying all the bills and all the rent) so we didn't risk this again, we talked about marriage and kids in the future, but agreed upon wanting to be financially stable first and both have careers. There is a lot of emotional support that he has given me and continues to, but he seems to be able to seperate sex and love in a way that I can't. Not that I keep track, but I can count the number of times he has gone down on me in the past four years on two hands. I've given him at least eight to ten times more head than that. He's even drunkenly admitted to me that he knows he neglects me, but this priority goes on the back-burner amongst all the other shit going on in our lives. I want to marry this man and I believe he wants to marry me. However, I don't want this to be a sexless marriage where I'm giving tons blowjobs and not getting any head, and one where he is paying other women to fullfill him behind my back and in financial secrecy. I keep telling myself that someday, we'll be able to afford birth control and can start to sexually re-connect, but I'm still paying about 80% of the bills with 100% of my income and no health insurance. So we may not be having sex, which is inevitably mutually pleasurable, but he still gets blowjobs on average about three times a week...point being that no one could claim he is being sexually neglected within this relationship, whether or not this is enough stimulation for him, beggars can't be fucking choosers.

The Confrontation:
When I confronted him about what I found when I was snooping, he was out of the house. I took pictures of the audio files on my phone and sent them to him via text with some nasty words attached about packing my shit up and being gone before he got home. He called me crying, begging me to give him a chance to talk in person. Long story short, I ended up giving him a second chance. I demanded to see phone bills in the near future to prove he wasn't still talking to her. He said he'd do anything to prove that this was a one-time, selfish mistake.

The Aftermath:
Never gained access to the phone bills. I snooped a few more times after the initial time. Not proud. Tried really hard not to. Knew he was still not being 100 with me. Found that he had talked to the ex at least once, confronted him, he told me that she was inevitably a part of his life because they were together for seven years and he heard she had cancer and just wanted to make sure she was healthy. He said he understood my reaction and this is why he didn't tell me he talked to her. He said he understood why I was currently upset due to the circumstances. He explained that he doesn't love her anymore but still cares about her. I can understand this, being a very empathetic and sensitive person. But the fucking circumstances! In three more years, I'll have been with him for the same amount of time he was with her...will she still be in his life? Am I wrong to want her out of it? She cheated on him towards the end of their relationship and he cheated as well...am I destined for the same long-winded fucked-up downward spiral that only becomes hot once he's lost me and is with someone else? Is the only thing that turns him on the fantasy and dirty-talk associated with cheating on me? Can I ever gain confidence in this situation? Can I ever be a domme? I want to be. I want to be everything for him. Everything but our sex life is so good when it's good. Everything including our sex life is so bad when it's bad. At what point is it worth it and at what point am I just in fucking denial? Can't talk to my old friends about this because they will simply say to leave. Can't talk to fam about this because it's pretty explicit. Feels better just to vent to strangers, as dysfunctional as that may be...and I can't afford therapy right now so thank fuck for y'all.

Since the beginning of our relationship she’s been straightforward with me that she’s bisexual. That she fantasizes about women, and that there’s a woman in her sexual history. Our sex has never been great, but I have a relatively low libido for a man of my age, so it never bothered me much. 

But with all the talk between her and I while she processes a mountain of neglected emotional issues, she has confessed to me that she thinks she might be gay. 

I told her that I’d support her while she figures this out, that she might be confused because she’s feeling a lot of different things, and that I want to give her the time and space she needs. 

I’ve also told her that this issue is obviously personal to me, and that while I appreciate an open line of communication, she needs to find someone else to talk to about this (in addition to her therapist). I’ve also told her she’s not getting a “hall pass”—cheating is still cheating. 

So what do I do? I’m in no hurry to get out of this relationship and even if it is in its last throws, I want things to remain amicable between us for the sake of our daughter. How much time do I give her? Should I be the one to call it off?

My wife would not have admitted this to me as a passing thought; she’s not a naturally open person. This was a considered admission, so I’m inclined to think it’s probably true. 

We don’t have a lot of money. More debt that cash. I’m not worried about lawyers because 1) there’s little or nothing to take and 2) my wife is terrified of financial matters and won’t take the initiative. 

tl;dr: wife’s probably gay. How much time to do I give her to make up her mind before I leave? ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_1f9m16,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1f9m16/my_wife_34f_thinks_she_might_be_a_lesbian_32m/,

I've known her practically my entire life and we've always been great friends, but we've been seriously dating for about a year now. She and her two kids live with me in my house and my great fear is that I'm beginning to overlook the failures within our relationship for the sake of her children, who I adore. I do genuinely love her, and it pains me to think about life without her, but I'm beginning to suspect that this feeling is not exactly mutual. She is still technically married to their father, but they rarely see each other and jealousy is a non-issue. However, she did basically leave her husband to be with me. I did not push her to do so, but I feel quite guilty whenever I consider breaking things off.

The main problem seems to be that we've gone back to just being good friends. Raising two children in addition to working and taking care of a house certainly takes its toll, but I seem to be the only one making an effort to be a partner to her in addition to those other roles. Lately our sex life has simply disintegrated to the point that we're only being intimate about 2-3 times a month, which seems fine for her but remains rather frustrating for me. I try to be as romantic and affectionate as possible on a daily basis to show her that I do love her and I'm not only thinking about sex, but at this point it feels like she's not interested in anything more than cuddling. Our conversations about the issue quickly turn into arguments, and she insists I'm trying to attack her no matter how delicately I bring it up. I hate to put such importance on something so trivial but I can't imagine spending my life with someone who seems to have such a different sex drive. I'm worried we're simply too different in this regard, and it will always be an issue. She's currently not even on the pill, or any type of hormone therapy.

Another problem stems from her job. She works a 9-5 at a local shop in town, but she only does so to stay active, meet new people, and stave off boredom. I have the luxury of working from home and running my own business, so we're very secure financially. But lately she seems to think that because I work from home, that means we must cater exclusively to her job. One of the kids gets sick? She goes to work and I take care of them. Kids home for a holiday? She goes to work and I take care of them. She has to stay late? I need to drop what I'm doing and pick them up from school. She doesn't even ask me anymore. She just assumes I'm capable of dropping everything, no matter what, no matter how important, to care for them. I'm not sure if you've ever tried to do paperwork or talk to customers with a sick 3 year old on your lap, but its quite difficult. She acts as if her having a job means that I have to pick up the slack and do everything else. The division of labor is seriously skewed. I keep asking myself, ""what would she do if I had to go into an office every day, and why isn't she even slightly appreciative of the fact that I don't?"". Her job accounts for about 5% of our total income, but she expects me to make the sacrifices in my work so that she doesn't have to do so with hers. But like I said, watching the kids, or caring for them when sick isn't what bothers me. Instead its the fact that she doesn't even bother to consider the fact that she might need to make sacrifices too, and what really angers me is the fact that I shouldn't have to ask a woman who presumably loves me to share the sacrifice.

It feels like we've become nothing more than just roommates, and I fear I'm staying in this relationship just for the kids at this point. I fear how guilty I would feel for suddenly being gone from their lives. I don't want to hurt two innocent kids. I love them all, but its getting so much more taxing to invest so much time, effort, emotion, and money into someone (my gf) who seems to be going in the opposite direction emotionally.

To be honest, I don't even really expect much response. I could sure use some advice, or maybe more importantly some perspective, but maybe I just needed to vent. 

Sorry for the walls of text.

Edit - Wow, I half expected this to get buried but you people are awesome. So, here's the million dollar question...if we can't work things out, am I a horrible person for abandoning two great kids just because their mom and I weren't perfect for one another?

I didn't have to sleep on the couch still got laid that night! ,ladycarp,123,55,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/11fyuy/i_told_my_fiance_that_he_was_gaining_weight_i/,"The success kid in me is extremely happy. 

My fiance used to be really, really heavy before I met him. You wouldn't know it from looking at him. Still, even though he's kept the weight off for 3 years, he is always worried about his weight and his appearance. He wears a size small, but still frequently asks if he looks fat. It's an understandable insecurity, and I am more than happy to tell him how sexy he is. Generally, I shower him with compliments, and the other day was no different. 

Now, lately, his schedule has really packed up hardcore, working 50 hrs a week while in school full time getting his doctorate. His schedule has been tight, and he had to cut out exercising from his routine. He hates it, but he's barely finding time to do anything these days, the poor guy. 

Unfortunately, his lack of exercise has caused him to pack on a few pounds. I know how insecure he is about is weight, and how scared he is of gaining, but when I looked at him, I noticed a tire was forming around his waist. It wasn't terrible, he's still not fat, but he's put on a few lbs. It doesn't bother me any -- I just know that he's worked very hard to keep the weight off, and I want to make sure to tell him before he starts bad habits. 

I approached it logically:

""Honey, I love you, and this might make you a little upset. You need to start exercising again.""

""I have no time for that.""

""Well, to let you know -- because I know you'd want me to tell you-- you've gained a bit of weight.""

""But I still weigh the same!""

""You haven't exercised consistently in almost a year, honey. You've lost muscle, and gained fat to replace the muscle. And since you know muscle weighs more than fat, you have had to gain a significant volume to maintain the number on the scale.""

After that, he was a little upset. I expected him to be. 

""I'm really sorry, honey. You told me to tell you.""

A few minutes later he came back to me and gave me a kiss. 

""I'm not fat.""

""No shit! You still wear a small. I was just giving you an update. You're sexy as hell.""

After that, he was perfectly okay. And it led us to mindblowingly awesome sex later. 

Moral: Be honest, be objective, and use logic to justify your statements. Even when emotions become involved, a step back from clearly explained rationale will lead -- eventually -- to an understanding.

Should I share it?,thefemaleredditor,82,15,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/10kyuo/my_buddy_30m_is_having_problems_with_his_long/,"The shortest version possible is this: my buddy, A, has been dating B for about 3 years.  About 8 months ago B moved to Europe to find herself and check some things off a bucket list.  A stayed here in the US.  B was supposed to come back 5 months ago, but now she's extended her stay for the third time, and she hasn't investigated purchasing a ticket home.  A wants to talk to B, but B never has time to talk more than a few pleasantries, and hasn't made any time to talk to A.  I think B just wants A to break up with her so she can roam free, but A is a good guy and doesn't want to do anything without at least having a conversation first.

Here's the thing: I know, completely by accident, that B did this to her previous boyfriend as well.  I met a guy at a concert a couple years ago with a mutual friend and we all started talking.  Somehow B came up (she has an unusual name) and he said ""B Lastname?""  I misheard him, so I said ""No, must be another B"" but realized later we were talking about the same person.  This guy talked about how B essentially vanished on him and he found out later that B was dating some dude named A (my buddy) while she was still taking this guy's calls and saying things like, ""I love you, I just don't have time to talk right now.""

So, finally, my question: should I share this knowledge with A?  I guess I should have said something when I first heard it, but A and B's relationship was still pretty fresh then.  Or should I let the relationship take it's own course?  I should mention that I'm a little worried that A will be angry with me for holding back info and/or supplying info that might help end his relationship, but he's such a nice guy and I think he deserves to know.

THANK YOU to anyone who reads it and gives me advice, I feel really lost and not sure who to talk to.

So we've been dating for nearly 6 years and have lived together for about 5 and a half of that. Basically we are very close and do most of everything together. 

I just graduated college and started my career. Things have been ok for the most part recently (no more school stress has really helped!) except my birth control Id been on for years suddenly started causing a lot of hormonal issues for me the past 3ish months. I've been in and out of the doctor trying to figure it out and finally start new stuff this weekend. Anyways it has resulted in me being unstable where I get very upset over things for no real reason. Not all the time but several times a week. It's been rather difficult for us both and I have felt really out of control and terrible about it all. I've been doing everything I know how to control my outbursts but it feels like I have reverted to a 6 year old with no impulse control. I feel very lucky he has stuck around this long.

Well last night I had a really rough day at work and wanted to just curl up and watch a movie with him and was annoyed when he wanted to go and get ""medicine"" from his friend because we still had plenty and I didn't understand why he couldn't do it the next day. I was irrational about it and got much more upset than I should have like has been happening lately. He went and did it and it really irritated me so when he came home I was not happy and we started arguing. I raised my voice and he came over and slapped me. I don't have any marks and I'm fine today so it wasn't like he punched me or gave me a black eye, just slapped me to ""make me stop yelling"" but not to hurt me but he is a foot taller than me and nearly twice my weight.

I don't know what to do, I don't know whether that is bad enough for me to leave him and our 6 years relationship. We'd planned on getting married when he felt he was ready and building a house and everything. I really feel like with all he has put up with lately with me I should just let this go but I also feel like I should respect myself more than that. He doesn't seem to see much wrong in it because I was yelling at him and he didn't know how else to make me stop yelling. This morning was spent with me pretty much doing everything I could to apologize, he said sorry but that was it, seemed pretty annoyed at me still though.

Also I've wanted to marry him for years but he keeps coming up with reasons why he isn't ready, the latest being my birth control issue because he doesn't know if I will stay that way forever (which I find dumb because I wasn't like that before and Im sure starting new pills will make me normal again, its only been 3 months) and after 6 years he still isn't sure. Says he wants to be sure but he can't because he doesn't know who I will turn out to be. So I don't know whether its all a lost cause anyway, not sure if that is normal or not after 6 years. I mean I've known for several years I wanted to marry him no matter what happened and even though I get annoyed when he goes through rough phases I never don't want to be with him. He has it great, I cook, clean, he gets blow jobs nearly every day, I have a great career, am a real looker, and just do about everything for him and if its not enough after this long will it ever be? Am I fool?

If I should leave him, how do I do it? I can afford to live on my own but I have never done so, I moved right out my parents and in with him at 18. Most my friends have moved away or are really involved with their lives and we rarely see each other so Id be alone most the time and that scares me so much. He has all my electronic devices hacked and I would have no clue how to fix anything if he wasn't there. And his family... since my mom died last year his mom has been a life saver for me. We go over there every week for dinner, laundry, and to just hang out. I love them to bits and they would be crushed as would I if we didn't work out. I'm strong but I'm not sure I'm strong enough to not go back to him.

My early family life was difficult. My father has a learning disability and a serious personality disorder. He loves his 2 girls but has never been able to hold down a steady job or make any real money. My mom worked but didn't make much and we only got by because of the generosity of family members. When I was ten, my mother had a breakdown and since my father couldn't care for my sister and I, we went to live with my aunt (my father's old sister).

My aunt is a single attorney and does well for herself financially but no one in the family knew she was a functioning alcoholic until we went to live with her. After a year of hell, we were taken out of that home and adopted by my other aunt (my father's younger sister) and her husband in another state. My life went from being terrible to incredible. My aunt had married a man who was a dot-com millionaire and they were both awesome people. I could't have asked for kinder and more loving parents. They raised me and my sister right along with their 2 sons, gave us everything and paid for private schools. I was very blessed.

My uncle has always been one of my favorite people in the world. It was nice having the security of his money but it was more than that. He is just an incredible man. He would take a bullet for me or any of his kids, he is just that kind of man. 

We all went through a terrible ordeal my freshman year of college. My aunt who raised me passed away from cancer. She went from being diagnosed to passing away in about 5 months. It was devastating for all of us, especially my uncle. For about a month he was just out of it and his parents had to come stay at the house to take care of everyone since he just couldn't function. He ended up bouncing back and is still a great dad for me, my sister and my two cousins. 

In the years since my aunt has passed, if my uncle has had another girlfriend or any kind of female companionship it would be news to the family. He just never wanted to talk about dating, he was just focused on being a good dad.

Since going away to school, I think about my uncle all the time. I have always thought of reasons to go home whenever I can just to spend time with him. I have dated and had boyfriends but I think of him constantly. If it seems creepy to you, it is creepy to me as well since he raised me but I can't help it. I am totally in love with him. 

I am terrified of of facing the scorn of my family if word ever got out that I expressed my feelings to him but my feelings are about to overwhelm me. I am giving serious thought to seducing him one evening when everyone else is asleep. I want him to know how I love him. I have never felt stronger about anything in my life. As weird as us being a couple would be for everyone, I think everyone would eventually deal with it. This isn't a crush, this is the love of my life. 

If he rejected me, I would be devastated but if he ended up never wanting to see me again, I would not want to live. He is so dear to me.

Wondering if I handled things correctly.,EmotionalMillionaire,96,24,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pwe4s/i_ran_into_my_ex_last_night_wondering_if_i/,"Long story short: I'm a 22 year old male. My ex is a 22 year old female. We were together for 10 months until she ended things because she wasn't in love with me anymore. This happened 4 months ago. She now has a new boyfriend and I am currently involved in a FWB situation with her best friend (though I've known this friend before I met my ex)

This is last night:


I went out last night to a pub, and my ex was there as well. I ignored her completely and just had with my friends. The pub was rather empty (like 10 people max.) so while I was getting drinks, my ex turns around and just asks me ""so you've slept with X a lot, haven't you?"" I was like what the fuck? Since I haven't talked with my ex for a good 3 months now. We ended up talking a lot. Well ""talking"", just me telling her how much she has changed negatively. That sounds really rude but it's basically what I told her, I'll be honest.


My friends then left because they were drunk. I stayed there with my ex, and I just continued being honest with her (she asked me) and she told me how she feels like I've changed a lot as well. I was honest and told her that it's because of her. 3 months ago she had a new boyfriend already (which is perfectly fine) but she made out with him infront of my eyes, as in, literally waiting until I was looking and then making out with him, while she knows I've been seeing a psychiatrist because I relapsed into an old depression after the breakup (all is good now though).

The pub we were in closed so we both agreed to a truce for tonight and moved to another pub for one last drink.

There we continued talking about how life has been/our future plans, as much of an asshole this may sound, it was pretty clear to the both of us that I was moving on positively while her life was a horrible mess. (I'll be studying abroad in Asia for a year starting next month, been traveling a lot lately while she's just a general mess really, getting blackout drunk every Friday/Saturday night, embarrassing herself and her ""friends"" (not my words, that's what her 'friends' say)


She was drunk last night as well and she ended up telling me she cheated on her boyfriend, awkward. Eventually that pub closed as well  and when we left we said a final goodbye while she kept begging us to be friends again and I just kept saying ""NOPENOPENOPENOPENOPE"" and I told her that I talked to her only for tonight and that it was nice to hear how she was doing, but that I don't want anything to do with her anymore whatsoever, that I've moved on. I then told her goodbye and asked her to please not cheat on her boyfriend again (he doesn't know about the first time) because it's not a nice thing to do.

10 minutes later, while I was walking home, she called me. She started talking about how she felt this tension between us during the goodbye (I have to admit, it was crazy and I could totally have scored with her again but luckily I told myself fuck it, you've came this far, not going to ruin it all by doing her) and how she was really thinking of doing something and how she felt really attracted to me. She then again begged us to be friends but I told her that that's not an option at all. That I've tried plenty of times to be friends and that she rejected every single time, and that I'm now rejecting her offer and hung up.


This post is a bit all over the place I guess and seeing how English is not my first language, it might not make a lot of sense.

I'm just wondering, did I handle it well? Perhaps I shouldn't have been so much of a jerk to her but she asked me to be honest and honestly, she DOES look like a mess.

I am male, 25 and just started a relationship with a lovely woman about my own age. But as with other girls before (in recent years) I just don't seem to have these wild feelings anymore I had in younger years. I don't seem to get wild crushes anymore but feel an all too adult emotional/intellectual and physically attraction. But it's not like I'm head over heels.

I am not sure if this is what adult relationships are supposed to feel like? Are all these crazy strong but usually unrequited feelings from our youth really purely hormone induced? Or am I just numb (after a lot of rejection and way too much self reflection about every single aspect about me and my feelings)? Or ist it films and books that make us think we should have these incredibly strong feelings all the time with these incredibly flawless partners?

Also: When I was young, I can remember, that I just fell for someone, not knowing anything about them. Today if I see someone really sexually attractive or cute but realize they would not be intelectually stimulizing to me, then there is just no way I could really feel something more than just hornyness for them. On the other hand, when I am attracted to someone intellectually, I might not be as incredibly horny all the time and craving them every single minute of the day.

This all seems so ""boring"" in comparison.

As we were on the couch, having fun and kissing, she accidentally touched my erect penis, which I was trying to hide from her. She decided to stuff a pillow in her shirt in an effort to look ""pregnant"" and told me, ""Maybe this will turn you off!""

Well, it didn't. It made my dick much harder. 

To keep a long story short, we ended up having sex a few minutes later. I insisted she keep that pillow in her shirt because it really turned me on (Didn't tell her it turned me on, just told her to keep that pillow inside). Lo and behold, that was the best sex I've ever had. 

I'm much too young to be thinking about having a family with my sweetheart... but damn if her pretending to be pregnant didn't turn me on. Sure, one day I would want to start a family with her, but not right now, but the thought of her acting pregnant makes me happy.

She was quite shy but I had a huge attraction to her and asked her out, she said yes, quite quickly we became quite a close couple.

We've been living together 3 years with some small downs, but overall it's been good and I do love her and want to be with her, I just don't know if I can accept who she is.

She has no friends, she only really talks to her mother and sister.  I couldn't care less if she want's to live like this if I thought she was truly happy with it and it didn't cause rows between us, but anytime she is out with my friends and their girlfriends are there, she just sits there on her own, never making any attempt to talk to anyone of them.  

The next day she'll be in a bad mood, plain rude to me, short answers, no desire to engage in conversation, i'm guessing she feels awkward about the night before, and then she says that my female friends hate her and are rude to her.  From what I can tell they just don't talk to her as she makes no effort herself, they would have no reason to dislike her.  If I dare suggest that they aren't rude to her, i'm always told that I side with them and don't listen to her.  Honestly, they are not rude to her and anytime she isn't out with me they ask why and send on their regards.

It's very hard for me to be myself around my friends when the girlfriends are out too, I can't help worrying about her feeling awkward and the next day she is very rude to me, but i put this down to her feeling bad herself about not being able to be sociable.

She also has no hobbies, I do like to head out and play sport with friends but if this involves me taking a Saturday or Sunday away from her, she will be withdrawn and quiet with me for a day afterwards.

She always says I never want to do anything with her and gives out to me, I do suggest things, but she doesn't really like going out for drinks, doesn't share any of my hobbies.  We end up just walking around and grabbing dinner.  She never suggests anything really to me, but I feel like I'm constantly putting on a show for her to keep her happy.

These issues have caused rows before, anytime we have had fights it's usually been the day after I've gone out with friends or done something without her.  She could be up cleaning the place furiously the next day and start screaming at me because I never clean up etc.. I do clean up.

I'm confused, I do love her but I feel like she's abusing me somewhat, I let her live her life as she wants yet she seems to begrudge me having friends and doing my own things and wants to control me.  She does judge me somewhat and tells me I shouldn't do or say some things that I choose to do.  Even though these things have absolutely no consequence on her.  

She was very suspicious of some of my female friends when we first met and kept telling me she knew they were into me, i doubt it to be honest, and I wouldn't be dishonest to anyone in a relationship like that, if they did like me that wouldn't be my problem.  Also anytime a girl friends me on facebook that she doesn't know she always has to know everything about them and questions why I would friend these people and that it's ""strange"". 

We've been together 5 years and i'm in my late 20's, I cant carry on like this forever, although breaking up with her would really break my heart.

Right off the bat, she was not *really* my type in terms of personality but her pics were okay and honestly I've been pretty lonely, so I figured, what the hell, could be an interesting fling.

Fast forward to last night, after about two weeks of messages I start pressing her to meet. We've developed a decent rapport at this point and I figured we'd have a pretty good time if we went out. She says that she would also like to go out some time but she then confesses that the pictures on her profile are not really her. She said she wasn't trying to be deceptive, but that she is just paranoid about having her pictures up on this public site ಠ_ಠ.

At this point I should have said, fuck you, that isn' t cool and blocked her, but after two weeks of talking to this chick I just had to see what I was really dealing with. I said it was no big deal and that she should send over her real pics.

My question is, how should I proceed from here? I don't want to just not reply at all, but I'm not sure what to say. I mistakenly told her that tricking me was no big deal, so now I really don't have a viable escape route. What do you guys think?

Edit: Some additional information about our past, taken from an earlier comment:

My gf does not like some of the other girls, a particular sorority, my class, and prefers me not to be around them. This is due to a few reasons, but mostly bc when my gf and I were on a break 4 years ago, I was hooking up with a member of that sorority. However, 4 years ago when my gf and I got back together, I only told her that girl and I kissed once. It wasn't until a year and half ago where I told my gf thr truth (the girl that I hooked up with transfered out of my school 3 years ago). Additionally I did lie about the names of themes of mixers that I attended, and hid some information about them a few years ago. That has been why she has some trust issues. I understand that I was completely wrong for lying to her and know that it takes time for trust to be built up, but still feel this reception is one that I should still be able to attend. 

The first time it was discussed between us two, the reasons were clear that she doesn't think any social event where the SO isn't allowed to attend is one that is inappropriate, not just ones where there are people she is uncomfortable with me being around. Her defense was that her parents would never even think of going someplace where the other wasn't welcomed.

1363168238.0,66,self.relationship_advice,1a7hdz,[26/m] I think my girlfriend [24/F] is a pedophile,gfstorythrowaway,89,23,247,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1a7hdz/26m_i_think_my_girlfriend_24f_is_a_pedophile/,"First, some background: I'm 26, she's 24. We met in college and have dated for the last 3 years. Our sex life is pretty average; we have sex 2-3 times a week (it used to be more like 4-5 when we started dating, but it slowed down as time passed). I'm usually the one to initiate it, but she's always seemed receptive and enthusiastic, and I thought we were pretty much on the same page about things. We're pretty vanilla.

My girlfriend has some interest in being a writer, and about a year ago, she began self-publishing erotic fiction on Amazon.com, because she said it was good practice. She's not especially popular, as far as I know, but she's successful enough that we get a little extra money from it. However, she won't tell me her author name (she publishes under a pseudonym) or let me read her work before she puts it up. She's pretty private, so this didn't surprise me, but I was always interested in checking out her stuff, especially as apparently people do buy it.

Usually she turns her computer off when she's not using it (I don't know her login info), but recently she left her computer on, probably by accident, while she went to work. I didn't have work that day, and realized it was on. Obviously I shouldn't have looked at her stuff, but I mostly just wanted to see if I could read anything of hers. Along with the stuff she puts on Amazon, which I did find, I also discovered that she writes a lot-- a lot-- of stories about boys having sex with adult men.

I didn't read all of it (we're talking tens of thousands of words) but I skimmed through some of the files over the course of the afternoon, and here are some of the main ""themes"" that seemed to reappear in the different stories:

* They're all about boys.

* They're usually 8-12, but I found a couple about younger kids, including one about a 6-year-old.

* Some of it was pretty nasty stuff, and even the things without actual sexual content seemed kind of... sexualized to me? I didn't spend a lot of time reading things in depth, but the vibe I got from what I skimmed was that erotic aspects were kind of always present.

* Maybe 80% of the stories I looked through were from the POV of the kid, while the rest were the adult's perspective. Most of the really nasty stuff I found was written from the adult POV though.

* Some of the stories pretty straightforward sex, but some of them seemed pretty in-depth. Elaborate worlds, big casts of characters, actual plots, etc. She had obviously put a fair amount of thought and effort into coming up with them, even though they featured kids having weird sexual relationships/dynamics with adults. Also some of them were more romantic? 

* She wrote other stuff, too, including a couple young adult (I think?) things, both of which had sixteen/seventeen-year-old girls as the main characters and no sex, and the erotic fiction she publishes (all of which is between adults).

I have my own kinks as well, and in any other situation I'd probably just forget what I found (it's my fault for snooping, after all), except that I also found a folder she has on her computer that has pictures of boys in it. There were a couple hundred files, and I didn't look through all of them, but the few that I opened didn't appear to be illegal, mostly kids in bathing suits/shorts/etc. Sleazy, but not actually pornographic. That seems much more borderline than writing, though. If it were just her own stories/imagination, I could maybe try and chalk it up to some kinky private roleplay thing or something, but this seems like legitimate attraction to pre-pubescent children.

After I'd looked around for a while, I got uncomfortable and closed all her files and then shut down her computer and put it back where I found it. She hasn't mentioned anything since that day, so I don't think she's aware of what I did.

This came out of nowhere, and I'm just not sure what to do now, honestly. We have a good relationship overall, but this is really sitting kind of weird for me. Neither of us has kids, and my GF has stated a couple times that she doesn't really like kids and doesn't want to be a mother (I don't want kids either). As far as I know, she was never abused or anything as a child. I'm also kind of worried, because like I said, she's pretty private, and I don't know what else she might have on her computer.

We had sex the other day, and it was awkward for me, which she did notice, but when she asked me about it I just sort of brushed it off. Do I break up with her? She hasn't committed any crimes, but I'm not sure how to forget this, or even if I should. I have no idea how to bring this up, especially since it's something I'm definitely not supposed to know.

TLDR down the bottom if anyone needs, but i would really appreciate if you took the time to read the whole thing or at least skip to the 3rd paragraph onwards. im just looking for advice or some perspective on this issue thats pretty much tearing me apart. If you want a head start, skip to the dotted lines.
thank you so much in advance.

Let me begin by saying that BF and I have been dating since high school (both 16) and we’ve been together for the past 4 years. I’m not about to go on a tangent about how loving and compatible we are for one another, but I’ve believed for a long time now that he’s my soul mate. Sure we’ve had our ups and downs but generally speaking, life’s a ball. Worth mentioning – he did cheat on me when we were 17, it was a long and forgotten issue but now im not so sure. 

Okay, so BF has a friendship group of 5 including him. A year ago one of his childhood friends (who I also went to high school with, let’s call him Bob) met a girl on a rock-climbing trip and they hit it off. Long story short they broke up 6 months in, the friend moved away for a job as a manager for a tech company and the girl, let’s call her Kate, had grown on my BF’s friendship circle, so much so that she integrated herself into the clique.  I don’t like the idea of a recently single girl that I don’t know hanging around BF, I get curious about this Kate, so I search social Medias but I just can’t find her anywhere. I resort to reading text messages between BF and Kate to find out more about her (they mostly about talked about things like cars, fitness, and other people) but then I found some that were obviously about me. They weren’t anything sexual but just as bad, he was just telling her things about me, personal things that upset him or annoyed him about me. It wasn’t all bad, from these texts I improved a couple of things to make him happy and from what I could see, she was actually trying to HELP him repair things. We fought about the fact that he was texting her so regularly, he said he would slow it down but not stop texting her completely. He turns his phone away from me every time he needs to text now. 

Through the BF I find out she doesn’t use Facebook. I’m still uneasy about the fact that I know nothing about this girl, yet she knows intimate things about me through my BF confiding in her. She’s the only girl within my BF’s group and I like to think that she’s a bit of a slut for doing so, but my BF and his friends can’t speak highly enough of her and I can’t help feeling that there’s more to it. I don’t often hang out with BF’s friends, we have nothing in common and I don’t really like them too much. We have absolutely nothing to talk about besides a standard greeting and the awkward offering of a drink when I have to tag along with BF to one of their houses. But that’s another issue… 

.......................................................................................................................................

Kate had been dating his friend Bob for 6 months and for the whole duration of their relationship I had never met her, not even once (I have my own friends and commitments to tend to). 3 months have passed since the break up between Kate and Bob, coincidently my BF has gradually begun talking about her more frequently. He would relay funny things she said or things that she did whilst hanging out with her, her hobbies or what not, and instead of laughing along, I would become infuriated. He knew how insecure I was about the texts but he justifies his time spent with her because its in the company of all his other friends. It’s not like he was trying to make me jealous, but the topic of Kate was a frequent one. I envied how much fun he had with her because I know I can be abit lazy and unenthusiastic about some things sometimes, but that’s again another issue...

4 weeks ago BF threw a little get together in his apartment, his friendship group plus their partners and a few others. I met her for the first time at this party. I was sitting on the couch with my friend when BF comes behind me and taps me on the shoulder to introduce me to Kate. I immediately stammer and get a catch in my throat when I realise that she’s stunning, and it’s the epitome of my worst nightmare. She beamed at me and said hello, knew me by my first name, engaged in awkward small talk (on my part unfortunately), asked why I never came out with them, and left me to go mingle with my BF’S friends. This made me feel inadequate because I felt like I, the girlfriend of 4 years should have been on better terms with BF’s friends. Not this Kate. That night I made a giant effort to get to know his friends and we’ve been getting closer ever since. I go out with them occasionally, but Kate is always there, and this always infuriates me.

Firstly, I can’t help feeling inadequate every time I’m with her. She’s substantially better looking than I am (she’s half Asian half Nordic with these crazy hazel eyes). She has the strangest allure and a really powerful presence wherever she is. People listen and follow her, she comes across as a natural leader and in my eyes that is intimidating. She’s not a girls girl at all, she seems carefree. It’s affecting me every time I go out as a group with BF because I’m constantly trying to show her up (that’s so pathetic to see on my screen typed up) I try and come across as happy as possible with BF by leaning on him and stroking his hair and laughing really loudly, she hardly looks my way when we do and if she does, she smiles! I just have this fear that she’ll steal him or he will leave me for her, and if you saw her, none of you redditors would blame me. Everybody thinks shes so damn funny, he laughs like a loon whenever she tells a joke, but when I tell a joke it inspires only a small chuckle. 

I’ve become obsessed. I constantly surf through BF’s iPhone pictures and messages with hopes of coming across her (not because I hope he’s cheating on me, but because I just want to see her again/compare her to myself, I can’t explain why I do it) when I do find a picture with her in it, I linger on that photo and it makes myself feel like shit even more. I emulate the way she acts sometimes (playful no fucks given attitude) because I know BF finds it attractive. I have recently pretended that I’m into her kind of music, the slow metal/metal/psychedelic kind which I absolutely loathe, just in hopes that BF won’t leave me for her. Ive started talking about science and Philosophy to appear smarter, i find things that shes clicked on on reddit and read up and learn everything about it. ive started runing and doing sit ups.

She’s into everything I’m not. She can talk for hours with BF and his friends about camping, rock climbing, religion, travel, culture, cars, fitness, computers, for Chan, everything! She has a banging body and my God is she intelligent. She’s really into philosophy and likes to throw around her intelligence. She likes to smoke weed (which i think is disgusting and hate when she encourages my boyfriend to do it. i found a pretty new looking pipe in his draw and we had a fight about it only recently). Kate also trips on psychedelics in the forest or whenever she’s hiked and camping, the experiences she’s relayed as “profound” and “life changing” can go for hours with everyone engrossed except for me. I just dont find her hallucinations interesting, and dont even get me started on her stories from when she went to tibet and lao. I have a thing against drugs (as specially weed because my cousin has become heavily dependent on it). And now the worst part is that ever since hanging out with Kate, BF can’t seem to get enough of her.  It’s almost like I can feel him slipping away from me just to hang out with Kate. 

She’s become the object of my obsession. I know its unhealthy and that I need to stop. I keep telling myself that he chose ME, BF is with me because he chose ME, not Kate. But then again, what if he wants something new? What if he’s tired of 4 years with me? It tears me to fucking pieces having to think about all this shit.


TLDR: BF of 4 years is slowly beginning to become attracted to a girl that trumps me in every way imaginable, and I’ve slowly become obsessed with her, so much so that I try to emulate her in hopes that my BF will find me attractive and wont cheat on me or leave me for her.

Lover then punched her in the face.,djv456,91,21,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13lbqj/updatemyf20_mom_f43_walked_in_on_my_stepdad_m45/,"EDIT:// [Link to original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/13kp08/myf20_mom_f43_walked_in_on_my_stepdad_m45_and_his/)  

So this may be a little soon to be making a whole new thread for it, so excuse me if this is poor reddiquette.  

I got off work a little early today thanks to the holiday tomorrow. I went home to pick up her flowers and some cookies. When I got to her house they were both home, including my younger brother and sister. My mom and step dad were in his room (they have separate rooms) talking. My younger brother was completely oblivious to the situation, all he knew was that my step dad didn't come home last night. My younger sister knew everything, and said if my mom didn't leave this time she was moving out and going to live with my dad.   

My mom came out of the bedroom shortly after I got there and told me my step dad was very apologetic and calm, suprisingly, and so was she. But she can't stand him, stand to look at him, understand how he can do what he does. I couldn't stop thinking ""What does he live for?"". He's constantly telling her and us ""fuck you, you're nothing without me"", but in reality his own children don't talk to him anymore, and all he has are the drunks at the bar that only associate with him because he's the owner. We have each other and the futures we're building for ourselves, he's got us. If we're gone, then what? I mentioned that to her, and she PUSHED me to ask him. I felt scared and quite a bit awkward about it, but she really wanted me to ask.   

She knocked on the door and said I wanted to ask him a question, and he said it was fine. So I asked him, ""What are you living for? What makes you wake up in the morning and what do you have that makes you happy?"" He couldn't answer me. He looked at me and said ""I don't have an answer for you... that's a really hard question.""   

The next hour was spent with me mediating a talk between them. I told them why their relationship was failing (mostly HORRIBLE communication) and what they would need to do if they were willing to fix it. My mom was spilling out her heart to him about how lonely she was and how hurt she is about everything. Instead of apologizing, saying how much he loved her, saying what he would put forth to fix it.... He fell asleep.   

I took her outside and told her this time, if she doesn't leave, she's an idiot. He could not wait for her to stop talking about how she felt. He did not care about a single word she was saying. He just wanted her to shut up, and it was painfully obvious.   

She told me she was disgusted, and she doesn't think she can stay this time. We're all pretty confident she will leave, thank God, and we can't wait to move on.   

Also, we found out the girl is 20 years old, and was drinking at the bar underage. He'd been picking her up from her house, fucking, taking her to the bar, fucking after work, and then going to her place some nights too. She's told my mom that she's in love with him and will fight her for him. My mother is unphased by her and thinks it's sad to be so brainwashed.   

**tl;dr** Step dad is pretending to care, will go back to his old ways, mom seems to be sure on moving out and moving on this time. girl he fucked is only 20 years old/drinking illegally/wants to fight my mom for him.

Edit:// and about pressing charges, she wasn't going to at first but she has enough people chirping in her ear to at least consider it.

He was her fling between her ex boyfriend before me and me. In facebook Messages he would say inapropriate things and she would not answer them but redirect. She never addressed the issue with him that I could see. I was using her phone and she got a text that said ""When you come back, I want to take you to dinner. Just you and me"" She did not see it and I as she was going to work I told her that I was not okay with it. He also just got out of a marriage in April. I was asleep before she came home that night. 
Next day she goes to school and 10 min after she left I got a Msg asking me how work was. I do not work. I called her on sending me the wrong text. She denied it. She then exchanged a few more msgs with me in the 3 hours she is at school. When she got home she was overly nice and loving. I read her phone and she sent me the Text at 6:24pm. All msgs to him were deleted. However, he replied to a text at 6:25pm. The content of this text could have been the answer to the question"" how was work?"". She then ignored my texts and chatted with him. replying to my heated texts when he was not replying back. I got one every 15 min. she sent him one and got one every 1-2 min. I asked her about it. She flipped shit. Deleted all her texts and told me that she would continute to do so until I stopped invading her privacy. I told her I was not okay with this action and that it did not appear to be the actions of someone who is trying to prove her innoccence. I have not slept in the same bed with her in 2 nights and anytime I bring it up she yells at me and leaves the room...With her phone. She tells me this is my issue and I should deal with it and she has no need to respond to this insult to her. I tell her I disagree. Fight!

I work away for periods of time but then get equal periods of time at home.


I don't want to control her and I want her to enjoy herself. When she goes out it's only in our small town so its not like its an all night drinking fest or something. She has this friend who I know likes her even before I met her. He was friend zoned and she never wanted anything to do with him AND I trust her completely.


But when I'm away they go out together and he stays around hers because he lives a bit out of town. I know I trust her and all but I just really don't like it. 


The night we met I saw them both (knew them previously) and asked how long they'd been going out for. (a guy and a girl sitting at a table all night, what was I supposed to think). She came back with ""no we are not going out"" and that was that. He kept saying to me all through that night how much he wanted to fuck her and kept saying he was going to go home with her and..... well, he was keen on the idea of intercourse.


After finding out he was friend zoned I made my move and here we are many months later. The last time i saw this guy, who stays around when I'm not home, he was saying how he was going to fuck her all night long. I know things are different know, i fucking hope they are anyway, but i still don't like it.


Am i out of order or should she be more understanding of why im upset? (and yes i have tried to put forward a mirrored situation)


Sorry for the language, not very gentleman like of me.


**EDIT** Wow, loads of support, thank you. I should say that i do trust her completely, but just because i trust her doesn't mean i have to like it.

I messaged her (phone is not an option where i am) explaining my feelings about the situation and keeping my cool and just basically trying to explain WHY i didn't like it, and why anyone wouldn't like it. She says she feels like she isn't trusted.

Like i said, i do trust her and i know she wouldn't do anything. So am i just being paranoid and a dick?


**FINAL EDIT** Ok, she has agreed to stop letting him stay round and we are going to talk more when i get home next week. I will be meeting him face to face as well to do a bit of barking so he knows his place.

She laid out all the things that she was unhappy with and said that she is not sure she is capable of actual love, and that she doesn't know or love herself. She said she didn't think she loved me anymore and that we had become more like roommates.

I was and am devastated. I had noticed she had withdrawn a bit lately, but I attributed it to stress of some major commitments she has going on. She said all along that's what it was.

Thing is, she had been acting like she was totally in love with me for years and years. Saying all the right things, doing all the right things. I haven't been the greatest husband in the world, but I haven't been the worst either. Never cheated on her. I've provided for her, bought a nice house to raise a family in, she drives a nice car. I've been there for her in the darkest of times, including when she miscarried a baby last year.

So she's been lying all this time.

She's staying at her friend's house right now. She did agree to get marriage counseling. We went to the first session last night. I thought it was really good, that the therapist asked a lot of pertinent questions and that we were both very honest. At the end the therapist asked if I was on board with trying to work things out. I am, and told her that I think my wife is going through something right now and that I'd really like to try to keep our marriage intact and help her. The therapist asked my wife the same question and she thought for a second and said no, she didn't want to try to work things out.


The therapist did ask her that (playing devil's advocate) if we were to get divorced, 5, 10, however many years down the line, would she feel guilty that she never gave me the chance to try to change for the better and work things out. She danced around the question and said something about not knowing how the future would play out.

I don't know what to do. Literally on Friday everything was fine and I felt like I was in a loving marriage and Saturday it was all shattered.

I am hoping that some separation will lead her to think about things and decide to give us another shot. I'm not calling her, or texting her, as much as it kills me not to, because whatever I say it seems to push her farther away.

A week before the wedding, we both agreed to have time to ourselves; be with friends, go get in to crazy shit, etc. Basically a break before we got married. We never set any boundaries, but I thought it was assumed that we were still faithful.

We live together, happily, with a dog and a cat (well, the dog and cat were both mine before he came into the picture). I've never had any suspicions before, and in a way, I still don't.

We were doing laundry together and putting away our clothes. We tend to mix up each other's laundry, so while he was putting his clothes away, he was setting anything that belonged to me on the bed. I came across a thong and my first reaction was honestly, ""Oh, this is kind of cute, when did I wear this last? Oh, wait, I've never worn this. It's not mine."" I don't usually wear them, but I know for a fact it's not mine because a) I know where all of mine came from, and b) it wouldn't fit me if I tried. It's an x-small, and I've got way too much of an ass (for a white gal) to fit into an x-small. 

I pointed it out to him and he told me he had no idea where it came from. At first, the whole thing was sort of funny. It was almost impossible to argue about it with a straight face. There was just way too much to joke about. At one point, he said he had no idea how it ended up in his laundry, and I said something to the effect of, ""There isn't a thong-fairy that just maliciously drops other women's underwear into our washing machine!"" I was just trying to get the point across that it had to end up in his laundry somehow, but it just ended up being funny. 

I have *never* been suspicious of him before. I didn't even think he knew any women he could cheat on me with. He told me the only place he can think of that the thong came from is one of his sister's. He went to his mom's house the other day to pick up some clothes, and he told me that his mom tends to keep his and his sisters' clothes together. It seemed logical at the time and I left it at that. I genuinely believed him and I told him that. I told him if I ever found any reason to be suspicious, that he'd have to leave. He told me he understood, but that it really hurt him to know that I thought he would cheat. 

I don't know. I'm at a slight loss here. I'm almost fine with it, just because it was so easy to laugh at the situation earlier, but now I'm sitting awake and it's picking at me. His sister doesn't even live in the state, so why his mother would be taking care of any of her laundry is beyond me. It's just eating at me now. I love him so much, and until now, I trusted him with anything and everything. 

Part of it hurts because he doesn't even seem to want to pretend to understand why I'm upset about it. He brushes it off like it's completely normal for people to have foreign underwear show up in their laundry baskets.

I have more money than my GF. In the past, whenever she needed some pocket money, I would give her say a 20€ or even a 50€ bill and tell her to keep the change. She works hard and has no one supporting her and I was glad I could alleviate some of the burden of her money worries. She never abused my kindness and in fact made it a point to not let me spend too much money with her.

Last week she was surprised by some extra money she received - about 400€ extra, on account of Summer I guess. This fact changed my perception of her financial needs, and when I gave her a 50€ for something she needed to pick up at the pharmacy, I wanted to get the change back.

That changed everything. She returned the full 50€, saw my action has indicative that we're not really a couple (of the almost married variety), and has vowed never to take any money from me again. 

She said that she never worried much about where the money was coming from because sometimes I would pay for stuff and other times she would pay. This is true, but usually only for things of mutual interest like household expenses. Outside those I always considered my money, mine to spend.

Most people think I'm a cool person, I think, but I still feel totally apart. I just don't understand people at all.

Now that I've graduated college and I am in a strange town with almost no friends, I feel totally isolated. I've met people, but for some reason I just feel no connection to them. I find hanging out with them boring sometimes. 

As for women, forget it. My charm has run away, and I don't know how to meet them or talk to them when I see them. I just retreat into my little shell and sink further and further into a place where I don't have the confidence to talk to anybody.

1373842317.0,67,self.relationship_advice,1iavqj,Roommate expects me to watch her (crazy) dogs... for two months!?,grantmoore3d,82,15,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iavqj/roommate_expects_me_to_watch_her_crazy_dogs_for/,"I'l try to keep this short by just making a few things bullet point:

* Shared house, I'm M 28 and roommate in question is 40-ish F. 35 M is third, but not related.
* I have one dog, well trained (Buddy)
* She has two dogs, one is okay but the other is very insecure, scared of everything and very aggressive towards my dog and strangers. Both are poorly trained.
* I moved here because it fit my budget and was the only place I could find that would accept a dog when I moved to the city (Vancouver, impossible to find reasonably priced, pet-friendly rental units for big dogs)

Long story short, after moving into the house I discovered that this woman was planning to do several month-long trips due to work. The first couple trips she went on were okay because either I was home (wasn't employed) or she had a sub-letter to take care of them (a little worse, since the person didn't know how to handle dogs, particularly aggressive dogs).

More recently, she had a two month long trip coming up and I was wondering what she planned to do with her dogs. Well, time comes and she didn't find anyone, so she just left... leaving two dogs with abandonment issues to the care of myself and the other roommate, without any real expectation. I suck it up and help out, make sure they have food, water, get medicine, take them for a walk every now and then... but this was only because if I didn't, they would die.

She returns after two months of this and started bitching at me because they got fleas, because I would spend nights at my girlfriend's house and claiming I'm not taking proper care of my dog, who is stressed out because her dogs continue to be aggressive to him (largely because she's not there at all). She pretty much said to me that she wasn't pleased that I had ""gotten a job"" and wasn't home to take care of them, and that my girlfriend should be spending time over at my place so I can help take care of them / my dog... 

I'm so incredibly pissed off, spent two months dealing with someone else's responsibility as best I could while still having a work/personal life... only to be bitched at because her dogs require special care that I obviously could not provide. The obvious answer is to move out, and I will do so when I can, but for the moment I'm trapped here because I recently got laid off. Is there anything you can suggest?

In my opinion, this woman needs to give her dogs to someone who can properly care for them... she can't keep going on these multi-month long trips and expect whoever happens to live in the house to take care of them 24x7. According to the other roommate, she's done this to a previous roommate who had a dog.

Advice / suggestions? Basically just looking to make this arrangement as peaceful as I can until I can afford to find my own place. I love dogs and feel bad for hers, but I have my own to care for.

I came to terms with the nudity thing and decided not to let it bother me.

There is rarely or never any compromise offered. On the other hand, it seems like at least 30-40% of the shit that comes out of her mouth is a complaint about something. About me, our relationship, the house, etc. And everyone is expected to drop everything and submit to her complaint.

I've been with her for 3 years. I'm 32, she's 35. We live with her 3 kids. They're starting to call me ""dad"" and are very attached to me which will make things really difficult. But I'm very unhappy here. I feel like a subject, and any time I mention how I feel, either my feelings are minimized or I'm treated like dog shit. (She just walked out the door with the kids to go to the water park for the day. I was not invited. Apparently she's mad at me for some reason, the only thing I can figure is that I was angry yesterday that my feelings were again ignored.)

But my wife of almost 2years relationship for 5 recently cheated on me yet she acts like I'm some kind of monster. To clarify me and her have had a rough start we have a 3 yr old son who was unexpected and put a lot of strain on our relationship at the beginning but we worked through it. About 2 and a half years ago she left me and took my son and I did everything I could to get her back and in was finally able to and we got married. Now here's where things become difficult shortly after we married she was diagnosed with lupus and became pregnant with our daughter and due to complications my daughter passed away shortly after being born. 

Now unfortunately I deal with emotions badly especially sadness and pain I shut down and block it out so for the last year I was basically a zombie who could not be bothered, my wife would try and talk and I just didn't listen really because I didn't want to think about it. Go ahead a year and I'm finally starting to be me again we have good jobs and our sons doing well. She decides she wants a new job and gets an offer in a city an hour away, somewhere along the line she does not explain the job is commission only until I have quit my job. So things are tight because we have not moved down but I told her I would and I'm watching my son because she's gone 12 hours of the day. Well a couple days before I move down she starts acting weird and ignoring me and when I ask she says nothings wrong. 

After a week of being down in the new city and her acting like I don't exist I finally snap and go through her phone only to confirm my fear. She had gotten drunk and slept with one of her coworkers (they go drinking after work which I did not like in the first place). So I confront her about it and just the usual ""how could you do this to me?"" and she just acts cold and starts turning it into how I made her do it she couldn't talk which I've apologized for constantly. So I forgive her because I do love her and I don't want to lose any time with my son and we try and make it work but I still have this feeling. Fast forward 2 months I go through her phone again and fond that she's still talking to the guy calling him baby and xoxo  and I snap and call her a whole and tell her what a bitch she is since I've been pouring my entire heart out for her which is not an easy thing to do. 

Well now she claims this guy listens and he's her friend and she doesn't see any point in us fixing it because I'll just shut down again even though I show her constantly I'm trying to change for her and my son. I honestly don't know what to do anymore I feel stuck my logic says I should leave but I don't want to all she does now is complain about how I called her a whole and that's all I think of her and when I say she's pretty or I love her I don't mean it because she believes what you say when your mad is the truth, and I explain I'm hurt how am I supposed to react exactly? And she's admitted that if I had cheated she would've kicked me out already! And she's admitted she resents me because I can have children still and she can't. 

Every now and then she'll let her wall down but she throws it right back up I'm tired of my words meaning nothing she won't wear her rings I have to initiate all kissing or sex and even when we do have sex she just lays there. I just don't know how to get through to her I don't want to lose my son again I already missed getting to see him walk and talk for the first time.

I am M24, she is F23. Together for about 7 months.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/6zHlz.jpg) is a drawing of her body, so you have an idea of the scars. They are from self-inflicted injury.

The first problem is that I love this girl and I'm incredibly attracted to her... until she takes her clothes off. The scars *really* bother me. They were deep and they formed ""ridges"" so when I run my hands over her body I can feel them... and it kills the mood.

We have talked about it and she finds my distaste for them upsetting. She doesn't see her scars as deformities, she says they are ""beautiful"" and she that she ""wouldn't feel right without them"" because they're ""a part of who she is"". 

She did try to fix this issue by wearing lingerie that covers the scars, but ... I still have a problem with her *view* of the scars, which brings us to problem number two...

I don't understand how she can think her scars are ""beautiful"". She's very attached to them and when I asked, she said that if the scars ever went away she would have to cut herself (in the same spot exactly) to feel right again. This bothers me *a lot*... shouldn't she be *happy* to be scar free (if that should happen)?

For a while now, me and my husband have been arguing a lot, chalking it up to changing phases in how we see each other and our relationship aging, etc.

A few months back, he told me he thought it would be impossible to find someone he wanted to be with exclusively, and I grew into someone that he felt he wasn't compromising anything for.  I asked him again today if he felt that way, and he said no.  The parts I need to change has to do with porn.

We never really used porn together before, then I grew more okay with it for awhile, sending/saving some for him while he was away for awhile long distance.

Once he came home things slowly started to change, and I didn't want to see him look at porn while I'm sitting on the couch (looking at GW links, etc.).  This made him feel like the person he married was no longer who I was.

I'm now trying very hard to make up for everything and turn back into that person.  One of the things he wants is a partner that he can share everything with, including porn.

I asked if he wanted to get a blowjob while watching porn today as a gesture, then ended up acting upset and saying things jugdementally, which I know I shouldn't have done.  He told me I didn't have to do it anymore and he wouldn't ask me to anymore, but sounded really sad/pissed/upset about it.

He said I'm not a replaceable mouth in this scenario to use as a masturbation device, but that he feels connected to me even while looking at porn, like we are sharing the experience together because it is me blowing him.

On my end, I feel like shit.  I feel used, I feel like nothing more then a mouth to help him fap because it might feel better, I get NOTHING out of it (yet I LOVE giving head when its just the two of us).  He looks more at the porn then he keeps his eyes open with me (so it felt like he can look at porn the whole time while getting off, but can't stare at my naked body while we have sex).  He doesn't look at me, but says that asking to look at me more turns the tables and takes what should be his fap time and makes me selfish and things.

I just, no matter how much he tells me I'm not some replaceable part that any mouth could do, that the fact its me sharing in his porn/fap time is a connecting experience for him...its just not for me.  He's frustrated that he can't ""convince"" me of that.  I'm pretty much everything except a partner that he can watch porn with to get super horny, then fuck the crap out of, and have enjoy sharing blow jobs with him while he watches porn.

He cums faster with porn then with me, even when I dress up for him like he asks (when I do that sometimes I sit around half the night in lingerie waiting for him to be ready, making me feel like the sight of me dressed up for him can't get him raring to go like looking at porn immediatly can).  And if we look at porn to get horny, I feel like its going to be all the other girls that are making him horny, and he's just using my vagina to satisfy his urges he has for other women.

So, how to I learn to just fake it?  Because, it appears he either does it alone and feels like I'm not quite the person he married/the complete thing he's looking for in a spouse, or I just pretend and at least he's happy even while I feel used and like shit and like I don't turn him on more then the porn does.

I feel like a fucking prude and a bitch because I don't want any part of him and porn anymore.  I guess it doesn't help because I don't feel like we've ever ""made love"" or had sensual, explorative sex ever.  Its always pretty much rough or whatever.  There really isn't foreplay, or him exploring my body and just make it feel good for a good long while.  So it feels like he cares far more about ogling porn then he does about exploring my own body.  He says he isn't bored, but he also yawns while fingering me (usually just laying next to me, so not really emotionally connecting at all, he doesn't kiss my body or touch me in any other way then just finger my clit or whatever).  It turns me off and makes me feel aweful, again like he is more aroused/excited by porn then me, so the idea of looking at it with him makes me feel worse.

He says a lot to try to make me feel better about how much he likes it and things...but his actions aren't enough to make me feel like it.

There's also the trust issue, since she's clearly willing to lie or hide something from me out of convenience. It seems like my only recourse, short of writing her off entirely, is apathy.

I care about her and love spending all my time with her, but I'm not sure it will feel fulfilling to be with her if I have to share. (And yes, I've already said all of this to her.)

I'm not sure how to proceed. Advice, please?

Basically, I try to be the best girlfriend I can be, but like ~~most~~ many (since people seem to think I'm insulting them by inferring this) people I have deep-seated insecurities and some jealousy issues. The thing is, there's no reason for me to feel this way, and no past to support having these insecurities, really. A lot of people may feel these things, but for me it manifests into really ugly tantrums over stupid things- I get jealous over a passing comment about a celebrity's good looks, and I'm hyper-aware of the fact that guys look at girls around them every day to the point where it makes me extremely uncomfortable, even though I know it's normal.

My boyfriend hasn't done anything wrong, this is just a really ugly side of me and it's tiring and frustrating for the both of us. I don't want to feel this way, and he doesn't want to put up with it.

Neither of us know how to go about solving this problem though. I realize it's my problem, so how do I 'just accept' the idea that 

a) I'm not the only good looking girl in the world and that there are way hotter girls than me that will attract my guy's attention, and

b) I'm obviously his girlfriend for a reason.

All I ask is that you **please don't leave comments asking me to suck it up or explain that he's a guy and this is normal.** I know both of those things, which is why I'm asking for help in learning to come to terms with it. I don't have the means to see a therapist right now, I would just like some ideas on how to control myself so that I can stop feeling so miserable and destructive.

*I should add that, out of a mutual respect for each other, we tend not to talk about our superficial attractions to other people at all. We have talked about starting to do this a little, thinking that maybe I will learn to desensitize myself, but we're not sure if this would be productive. Thoughts?

How do I tell my mom to fuck off?",Eyms,92,22,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gc3e9/my_mentally_unstable_suicidal_mom_is_trying_to/,"Throwaway since I don't want my username compromised if this person happens to see this. 

A bit of background - 

I was raised by a mentally ill, mentally/emotionally abusive, neglective mother.  I was starved, sent to school filthy, told things from a very young age like 'you'll wake up one of these days and I'll be gone because I'm sick of you' or 'you have everyone fooled, you're a hateful despicable brat.' She did start 'running away' when I was a teen, would blow all the money for bills and every time almost succeeded in killing herself. She's claimed since then that it wasn't really her, that she has 'multiple personalities.'   Truth is, I don't give a damn what she tries to call it, for 20 years of my life my mother was abusing me and she's never taken responsibility or apologized.   She has a permanent victim complex, where she sees all bad things in her life as being done to her, with her not responsible for anything.  I don't know if she really believes this or if she's just that freakin psychotic. 

The last time I saw her, I came home from school (as a freshmen in college) to a half empty house and a note saying she was leaving because she was 'sick of my shit.'  I had started standing up to her abuse and she didn't like it.  She'd switched all the bills over to my name, taken all the money (I had $70 she hadn't taken), everything was a month overdue, the rent was due, and my name wasn't on the lease.  I had to lie to everyone that month to keep from being thrown out and homeless.  

My mom went to women's shelters and told them she was running from her abusive daughter.  They wouldn't tell me anything or even listen when I told them she was a danger to herself.  I had the number to a phone she had hidden from me, I called and called - she didn't answer for two days. I asked her why she'd left with all the bills and rent like it was, she told me 'you have a job.' (a job that paid 5.15 an hour and I worked at 10 hours a week...great).  The next day she changed the number.  When she finally did get back in contact with me, instead of calling, she just sent endless abusive text messages that kept me permanently on the edge of a panic attack.  I got rid of my phone and haven't talked to her in 6 years.  I suffer from depression and PTSD.

Currently - 

She's now trying to contact me (she found an email of mine).  I know I should be the bigger person and not go off on her and tell her she's fucking worthless, out of touch, uncaring, self centered, and should go fuck off - but that's all I want to say to her.  I was thinking maybe she'd changed, but then I saw she was telling people that she doesn't talk to me because ""I ran off because I was embarrassed and humiliated about her religion."" (she's wiccan)  So even today she's making this my fault and herself the victim.  I'm a female who's not prone to violent outbursts, but when I read that I about put my fist through my monitor. 

She's found my sister who was adopted before I was born.  She apparently spoke with her on the phone 5 hours yesterday.  My sister was abused badly in the foster care system, probably the same level or worse than I was.  I haven't spoken to my sister yet, and I really want to, but I'm so terrified at how to tell her our mom is ....not who she's probably portraying herself to her.  I want to let her know all the things she's done to me, tell her that our mom's lying to her about how she ended up being given away into the system, that she's untrustworthy and abusive, that if she'd stayed in our mom's custody her childhood would be pretty much the same except less variety in who was abusing her.  At the same time, I want her to make up her own mind on our mom.  I completely clueless on how to approach this. 

So I guess my question is - how do I handle telling my mom to fuck off?  How do I handle telling my long lost adopted sister our mom is a child abuser?

*Edit* I finally got the courage to read the email my mom sent me.  She basically asked if she had the right email and said she's been looking for me and she found my sister and gave my sister my email. She gave me her married name and current state but no city. Her name's sort of common so I can't find her online (did a fb search).  She signed the email 'i love you""  She has no idea I know she's been telling people I don't talk to her because I'm embarrassed b/c of her religion.  I was thinking of responding with this:

I will talk to her but not to you.  You missed your chances when you walked out on me 5+ times and refused to acknowledge how much you fucked up the first 20 years of my life.  You left.  Leave me alone. 

Is that too harsh? Should I just not say anything?  If I get an email from my sister, I don't want her to have to tell my mom that she had the right email but I'm not talking to her.  She shouldn't be put in the middle of this mess.

A lot of people tend to have the GTFO mentality. I just want to say that therapy/counselling/group sessions are so amazingly important. I have been going to group sessions for my own issues now for the past couple months and I wish I had done this YEARS ago.

I've been in two long term relationships that were headed towards marriage etc. I was deeply in love. However, my own personal emotional issues put a huge strain on these relationships. As I was younger and inexperienced I blamed a lot of these things on my SO not showing his love for me properly etc. I also wanted them to go to therapy for their own problems. They didn't go. 

I've always been a very strong person, but I was stupid to think that I could get better on my own. Now that I'm getting help, I'm becoming the person I've always wanted to be. I'm doing the work myself, but I've been given the tools to really make it happen. 

If I had done this years ago and if my partner had also gotten help, I might still be in one of those long term loving committed relationship. I know it's kind of taboo to get help, but trust me it's so *worth it*.

So to any of you out there that have had this idea in the back of their mind that they might need help, *don't postpone it*. There is no shame in it, and in fact I believe I understand myself so much more now and the things I want are coming easier to me. I'm also emotionally getting to the point where if I do meet the right person, I'll be more ready from my end. :)

Tl;dr If in the back of your mind you think you might need therapy but are too timid/afraid etc to go through with it, reconsider. It might be the best decision you've ever made, and could save a wonderful relationship.

**So grateful for all the amazing comments. Some people are worried about cost. Believe me I can relate. Just so you all know group sessions are often over looked (many are completely free or super cheap). They are so much more helpful than people realize. If you find the right group its amazing to just to hear other people going through the same things and how they're coping and getting through things. Also, many schools have programs that students rarely take advantage of. Schools also usually have counsellors too and you might even be paying for those services without knowing it in your tuition.**

**One more important thing I've noticed. You need to be your own health advocate. Sometimes there are huge waiting lists but if you bug them and tell them how much you need the help, you'll find yourself jumping up the waiting list faster.**",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_fo6sx,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/fo6sx/therapy_is_your_friend_even_if_you_think_you_dont/,
1290112359.0,67,self.relationship_advice,e8a5w,My best friend is in love with me and I can't lose her. Need your advice.,,89,22,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e8a5w/my_best_friend_is_in_love_with_me_and_i_cant_lose/,"I'm 25, she's 22. We've known each other for 5 years, been best friends for 3. Long story short - yesterday she called me asking me if I could come over, she sounded very serious. She sat me down and basically confessed that she was in love with me (without actually speaking those words). She said that it had been slowly killing her for months now (she's been tired and distant lately) and that she was sorry for feeling that way but that she couldn't help it. She asked me if there were a possibility of being something more. I told her I needed some time to think and left. I don't feel that way about her. I love her but I'm not in love with her.

Naturally, the best course of action would be to tell her that and be honest with her but by now I know that our friendship is pretty much over. She's the most important person in my life besides my mother and been that way for 3 years. We've been together through so much, helped each other get over our cheating significant others and so forth. I can't afford losing this person and by being honest I think I might just do that. It would be understandable for her to cut all contact in order to get over me and even if she didn't, this 'revelation' would definitely put a strain on our relationship and it would be weird and awkward. The bottom line is things would never be the same. I know I'm being selfish but I just can't lose her.

So I'm thinking of giving this a shot. There isn't that 'spark' between us (not from my side anyway) but she's a beautiful girl and one of the most caring and selfless people I know. She's the only person I can talk to about anything and she knows me through and through and I know her. I'm asking fellow redditors who have been there - is there any chance that I will eventually fall in love with her? Or is this doomed from the start? Will I end up hurting her more than by telling her I don't feel the same way? I really don't know what to do. I don't want to hurt her but at the same time I don't want to lose her. I guess I'm fucked either way but I'm asking you to help me, dear reddit.

**TL;DR:** My best friend is in love with me and I don't feel the same way.

**Edit:** Thank you all for your advice, I appreciate it. I've decided to take a few days to think things through but I guess honesty is the best way to go in this case. I don't know about pursuing a relationship, a part of me wants to and another part is very confused, we'll wait and see... I'll try to post a follow-up in a few weeks' time. Thanks again.

The one thing keeping me from locking myself in my room is knowing that, no matter what, I SHOULDN'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY. 

- If you didn't mesh well, it's NOT YOUR FAULT.
- If one of you was ready for a serious relationship and the other wasn't, it's NOT YOUR FAULT. 
- If one of you cheated, it's NOT YOUR FAULT. 
- If (insert your heartbreak here), it's NOT YOUR FAULT.

Why? Because you can only control who you are. You cannot control anybody else. I loved my ex boyfriend and I know in my heart he loved me. But we are two different people living our lives at two different speeds in two very different ways. When he hurt me he didn't set out to do so. He didn't wake up in the morning and think ""I'm going to do this just so I can hurt her."" He did what he did because that is who he is. That is how he reacts and deals with the world around him. It had nothing to do with me. And the same thing applied when I hurt him. 

Example: If he was mad he would ignore me for days. He would flirt with other girls. He eventually cheated on me. But he had also been cheated on in previous relationships. His home life was insecure, his personal life a wreck. I was naive. My failure at my career made me unmotivated. My past relationships made me jaded. When I thought my security was threatened, I would break up with him. We both desperately wanted the happiness we could give each other but neither of us were mature enough to be happy with ourselves, much less someone else. And THAT is why we hurt each other. THAT is why it had to end.

The bottom line is: It was not my fault the relationship didn't work. It was not his fault the relationship didn't work. It didn't work because we weren't ready. And taking things personally (""he's doing this just to make me cry"", ""he doesn't care"") won't fix it and make it work - it will just break me emotionally, take away my trust, destroy my self confidence... and make it that much harder to give the next boyfriend the unconditional love he deserves. Only when I grow into the stronger/better/happy/confident woman I'm meant to be will I be able to get the man I dream of.

So bravo, heartbroken reddit. You tried at love. For now, that is good enough. Don't take the break up personally... learn from it and become better for it. And don't let it stop you from loving again.

Edit: wording, format

Edit 2: Some people seem to think I mean to act like I did nothing wrong. I hope I'm not conveying that mentality... I know I did many things wrong in my last relationship and those things helped cause the breakup. To be able to move on I must own up to that. What I'm trying to say is that if you remove yourself from a position of self pity and blame you will be able to look at the events constructively, see what was done wrong and learn from it so that you are a better person next time. It is nobody's fault if a relationship wasn't meant to be. But do hold yourself responsible for the mistakes you made. 

Edit 3: I am not a happy, positive person right now. I am really quite depressed. I haven't slept in days. But I posted this in a feverish attempt to share something I realized with others who might be going through the same thing. It doesn't make my heartbreak go away but it does help to erase the hate.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_b7nrp,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b7nrp/hey_heartbroken_redditors/,

But, to make a long story shortish, I'm an only child, and my dad was a alcoholic who got violent after my grandfather died. When I was 6, he moved 4 hours away from us to take care of his father's estate, and 3 months later he was killed. My mother was written out of the will and trust fund, and I am the sole beneficiary (the trust is where we get all funds). The entire estate was auctioned, except for a small farm. We've been moving back and forth every year since. She has not been able to get a job and has been living off social security and my income. The farm has also not been that great of an investment, because our partner, who owns a quarter, has threatened her, switched the locks, and told us he paid the taxes when he did not, hoping to put us in legal trouble. This coming September, I will be leaving on a 7 month trip out of the country and won't have as much contact with her. Then I'm moving out of state for college. I have a feeling this is all just a bad case of empty nesting, but she will literally have no home when I leave because the trust will not pay for something that I'm not involved in. Because of that, the stress of empty nesting has been seriously enhanced and I have no idea how to confront it.

Obviously I know my mom has been struggling, but as a minor there hasn't been much I could legally do. I've been nothing but supportive, but she has let many people walk all over her and I am simply not like that. We were having an argument today about what I'm going to do for my birthday. I had suggested a small party at the farm with my friends about a week ago and she was fine with it, and then today she acts like I never even told her and that all I would do is drink and get in trouble. At this point I asked her why she has suddenly changed her mind, she starts accusing me of thinking about kicking her out once I become ""the age of the majority."" The moment she said this is I started crying. I couldn't bear to think of her thinking that I would want her out of my life. I know I shouldn't have, but I started yelling and asking ""What is wrong with you to think that? What have I done? Why do you think that?"" She starts grabbing her hair and yells at me to stop yelling. I bring down my voice and ask her, again, ""Why would you ever think that? How could you ever think that?"" And she just shrugs and starts folding laundry. I said ""What do you want me to do?! I don't know."" To which she just looks at me her mouth open like offended or cursed at her, and turned away. I have no idea what to do or say. I have never, EVER, told her I wanted to kick her out. Or even that I wanted to move out. I always thought we had a great relationship, even past that of mother daughter, because she is truly my best friend. I tell her everything. To hear that from her, felt like I was being betrayed or that she didn't think I really loved her. Maybe this is too much for any advice, but I'd really appreciate some. How can I make this better? What does she want to hear? I just want this to be better..

Thanks.

TL;DR: Well, you probably should read the longform, but my mom is financially dependent on me, even though I'm just now turning 18, and thinks that I want to throw her out of our apartment once I'm an adult. I have never said anything of that nature and we have always been very close. I'm not sure how to reconcile this, or if there is anything I can do as her way of exercising control comes off to me as very irrational and cut off from any kind of solution.

Some time around June of 2012 my girlfriend was outside working on something with company we had over and had left her phone in the kitchen. She got a text message and I saw it was from this dude she's told me she used to hook up with and still pesters her from time to time. We'll call him Eric. Anyway, I don't know why, but can't resist... I open the text and he's saying something about wanting to fuck her. She has an iPhone so I can see the whole previous text conversations. I don't even have to scroll back and I can see she's been telling this dude about she's been thinking about him fucking her on the kitchen table and shit like that. I'm infuriated at this point.

When she and our friend come back in, I'm cold and distant and she immediately picks up on it. When our friend goes in the bathroom she asks me what's up and I tell her that we will need to talk that night. I say something about ""I saw the texts you've been sending to your friend Eric.""

That night she tries to avoid talking about it. She frequently does this when we have disagreements. Just shuts down and doesn't want to talk. Sometimes she'll leave the apartment altogether. Anyway, I tell her she's at least going to listen. I tell her how I don't appreciate being lied to, being cheated on, and this will not fly. She's in tears the whole time. She explains how it will never happen again and I decide to forgive her and move on with our relationship.

Time goes by and things are back to normal. I've moved on and everything seems okay. The other night though, she has her phone charging in the bathroom and she gets a text message. This one from *another* dude she's told me has been trying to get with her, but doesn't have any history with. I decide to check it again. Yup. Same shit. He's trying to get some and she's going into **explicit** details on how she wants to blow him. Meanwhile we haven't had sex since mid-December... I still haven't said anything about seeing this one though.

I'm pretty well pissed and not sure what to do. Things are complicated because a bunch of other shit factors into our relationship. We live together and I lost my job in November... I can't afford a place by myself yet as I just started working again. She also does not have a car and uses one of my two vehicles to get to/from her workplace. We've also been dating for 3 years and have acquired a bunch of stuff together making that difficult as well...

I know she hasn't done anything with either of this guys because both of them live far away out of state. Both of them are guys from her high-school and that's how she knows them. I'm also fairly sure she wouldn't even really consider doing anything with them because, to be honest, she's quite a bit larger than she was in high-school and is ashamed of that. She doesn't post pictures on Facebook, won't let her picture be taken/tagged, and only shows face shots. 

The thing is, I do love this girl and I want to forgive her again. But I don't want to look like the schmuck who keeps falling for this bullshit time and time again. We talk about having a future together and marriage but I don't want to have to worry about her fucking other dudes all the time. That's where you folks come in... I don't know what I want but I'm here to take it. Advice, opinions, next steps (even advice on how to confront her on this latest string of text messages).

We have a gaylationship. I don't think this bit is terribly important, but you may want to know.

We've been together for maybe 5 months now, and I've been seeing him on and off for a solid 2 years or so.

Before me he was in a relationship with a scumbag who treated him rather poorly. They were in an ""open relationship"" because the guy couldn't keep his dick in his pants. He wanted a real relationship, but when things went south as they inevitably were going to, I was there. I promised I would be, and perhaps this was my first mistake.

I don't spend a lot of my free time away from him because he's currently unemployed and living with me. He had plans with his ex tonight (who is not the culprit btw) to see his new place. I booted up one of my old phones I had lying around that he uses and checked his search history just because he's had problems with a little overuse of pornography in the past. I found he had an account on a hookup website and I checked the inbox. What I found destroyed me. In the last two days he's been making plans for the rest of this week for a few little 'sexual rendezvous', in MY FUCKING HOUSE, in MY FUCKING ROOM, presumably on MY FUCKING BED.

So, what do I do? If Reddit doesn't change my mind, I intend to tell him that I know as soon as he gets back, but I don't know what to do after that. Do I break up with him? Do I give him a chance? The fact is my trust is completely lost.

Do you think there's any hope for saving this? Do you think he's going to inevitably do something like this again, even if I confront him about it and try to salvage the relationship?

I'm just completely lost, and this is really not how I was hoping to spend my night alone. Drinking and confessing to Reddit, that is.

Honestly, it was easily the best relationship I've been in, and as far as ""intimacy"" goes I was enjoying second base. But I thought that

* The relationship being in relative infancy
* Her going abroad in the fall

was enough reason to avoid getting serious. Apparently the abroad thing meant the exact opposite to her. After a while I had to avoid intimate situations because it was obvious what she wanted, and she called me on it. Admittedly I should have been more up-front. We broke up in March, just after spring break.

We met when we were 20, and have dated for two years, and lived together for one. We knew for a while that we didn't plan to work in the same city after graduation, so we didn't even bother talking about the future, marriage, etc. But we talked about everything else, and slowly but surely fell deeply in love. We barely ever fought, loved living together, and had a really comfortable, happy relationship that, under the right conditions, could have survived long-term.

24M here, I've pretty much had my whole life easy, I've got the rest of my life pretty much in the bag with a decent career and all.  I've had a few relationships, one in particular that ended recently that will probably kill me for a while, but I kind of hit that point where the least selfish thing I could do is just leave her alone rather than make her leaving me any harder by begging her to stay.

I've been talking to a lot of friends about it, and overwhelmingly the advice i've been getting, or reading everywhere, or what they're trying to do themselves is to not be in a relationship.  They say that i'm too young to be tied down, that I should be happy I'm single.  One of my friends just ended a relationship of 3 years, with a girl he didn't have any issues with, because he just didn't want to be tied down. Literally one day later he started hooking up with this other girl who came out of nowhere, because it was easy, and because she didn't want a relationship either.  My friends all tell me i'm young, that I should be meeting girls, that I should be happy I don't have to worry about anyone else, or to check in.

Maybe i feel this way since I don't really have anyone who would call me their best friend, that I was never close to my sister, or that it's something i've had for the past 3 years that i'm still learning to live without.  And maybe it's because it's the one thing I can't have right now, and when I did have it, I took it for granted.

But I love having that one person who gives a shit,  I love having someone actually give a shit where I was all day.  I love someone who will call me out in a split second when I'm being an asshole, or when I need to pull my shit together,  I love giving a shit about their problems, feeling needed, that I have power over making them feel better (or worse).  I can't do the whole meet chicks at bars, take them home and fuck them,  It's funny, it's something I always wanted to do in my dreams or fantasies, but when I finally got around to it, while this girl was attractive,  I had trouble because their were no feelings involved, it just didn't feel as good.  And I always thought that was just a girl thing, that guys would enjoy fucking anything that moves, but I dunno, I didn't.

This friend was also telling me how my judgement is clouded, that i'm desperate to find a relationship.  I don't know if desperate is the right word, but yeah, it's something I long for, because life alone is way more fucking miserable than sharing it with someone.

I may have given up on pretty much all my dreams in return for a safe life, and it's something i'll eventually be content with, but only If I have that person I can share it with.  I'm not going to go force love out of anyone I meet, or call up even older exes to try to coax up some feelings again.  but i'm not going to sit back and pretend that being single is awesome, because it fucking sucks, and i'll live it up, i'll get hammered with all my friends and i'll meet chicks and I'll flirt, and i'll enjoy my ridiculous salary, but I don't think that's going to make me happy.  

Maybe even with someone, it won't be enough, maybe nothing is ever enough for me, thats probably what my ex would say, and she may be right, or maybe it was just her I don't know. she left kind of because she didn't feel like she was getting all the shit i'm longing for in this post, and I have no idea why I wasn't her best friend (though she was mine), and I became selfish, and I don't know how i didn't realize it then.  But i'm not going to sit back and pretend that being single is somehow amazing in my mid 20's.  And it may make me selfish, but I need to be needed by someone.

edit: *I've seen many comments thinking i'm having a hard time meeting someone, or that I need advice on how to start a new relationship.  I'm not a forever alone WOW playing guy,  I'm also not some big muscle alpha male douche, but i'm attractive, i'm funny, and I can ""get"" girls.  The gist of this post was, I prefer being with someone in a relationship exclusively, than all the ""perks"" that come with being single.  I know I won't be single for the rest of my life,  And i'll do my best to live up this phase, but I won't enjoy it as much as a relationship.*",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_j32ao,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j32ao/please_tell_me_im_not_the_only_one_who_hates/,

I was perfectly content to go about my own business, doing what made me happy until someone took interest. But things are different now. I don;t know if it's my age (27 yo F), the fact that I've been through 4 relationships within the past year (ok, only one was a ""real"" relationship, but the others were potentials who just kept falling through), or the fact that I'm in graduate school and it is turning out to be a very lonely time. 

My most recent relationship ended a little more than two weeks ago. It was the right thing, but I can't help but feel hurt and resentful about some of the things that happened. What makes matters worse is that this person works in the same place I do, so as I'm trying to move on and heal I'm constantly reminded of them. 

I'm starting to feel really desperate. I am intelligent, educated, adventurous, active, and attractive by most people's standards. I just never seem to meet anyone. Two of the people I've been with in the past year claimed to really like me, just be unable to have a relationship. I can't say that this hasn't hurt, and I'm really starting to fee the ill effects of it. 

I feel like I'm at my wit's end. I don't know what else to do, or how to go about getting what I want. I just want a working relationship, I want to be with someone who wants to spend time with me. Why is this so hard for some people to find?

1265363624.0,69,self.relationship_advice,aydmz,Guide: How To Write a First Message to Someone Online,draynen,77,8,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aydmz/guide_how_to_write_a_first_message_to_someone/,"This started out as a series of pointers for my roommate who has been having some trouble getting women to respond to him on dating sites such as OkCupid. What was initially a few simple bullet points quickly turned into a five page breakdown of proper messaging etiquette, and from there I turned it into a video because I'm a huge god damn nerd. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5NHwDYZ77I

My response rates online have always been a lot higher than other people I know, and I firmly believe that it's because I follow a few simple guidelines when first writing to people. After sharing these tips with a few of my friends, they noticed a healthy increase in responses as well. 

I realize this is ""Relationship Advice"" and not ""Unsolicited Relationship Advice"", but I thought some people might appreciate a few general tips. Lord knows this is advice that I could have used five years ago. 

**EDIT**: *For those people asking for a write up, here's the script I wrote to make the video. There were some changes made as I was filming and as it was edited together, and all of the examples of ""What not to do"" I just improved, so I don't have a script for those parts. Other than that, it should be fairly faithful.*

One of the hardest parts of online dating is introducing yourself. Writing that first message to someone you’re interested in can be overwhelming, difficult and at times even scary. And it doesn’t help that women are vastly outnumbered by men online, which makes it difficult to stand out among the sea of other guys screaming for girls attention.

The bad news is, there’s a lot of white noise out there, and women are pretty quick to filter it out. The good news is, if we can figure out how to make ourselves stand out from the screaming masses, our chances of meeting a girl we’re actually interested in increase substantially.

But before we talk about what a first message to a girl should look like, maybe we should take a look at what we’re up against. There are three main types of “bad messages”. Writing a variant of any of these three is going to make it that much harder to get noticed, so I recommend avoiding them.

The first is “The Check Box”.

Lots of guys do this, because it’s easy and they’re not sure what else to write. The problem is, it’s nothing more than a variation of the old 3rd grade classic “I like you do you like me if yes please check this box”. The message says nothing to indicate that you’ve even bothered reading her profile, and gives her no real incentive to bother reading yours.

The next is “The Rambler”.

Seriously, this is just way too much. I know throughout that whole nine paragraph first message you sent to that girl you’re in to you think you’re being charming, witty and interesting. The truth is, when you first engage with someone, they aren’t looking for reasons to date you, they’re looking for reasons to NOT date you, and the longer you ramble on, the more chances you’re giving yourself to put your foot in your mouth. So for now, keep it simple.

Finally, there’s… well, just don’t ever fucking do this.

I can smell the axe body spray from here. Just don’t be a douche bag. And never, EVER, underestimate the importance of proper grammar, spelling and punctuation. And netspeak is like dating kryptonite. Avoid it at all costs.

Good, now that we’ve got those out of the way, let’s take a look at what a good message should consist of:

1)	It should show that you have read her profile.

If she mentions she likes guys who wear glasses, let her know that you in fact wear glasses, but only until you can afford lasik.

If she talks about how she’s always wanted to go to japan, mention that it’s a place you’ve always wanted to go as well, or how much you enjoyed visiting the temples the last time you were there.

If she likes Super Mario Brothers, tell her how much you always hated those fucking water levels.

It doesn’t have to be anything huge, and you don’t need to go gushing on about it. It just needs to show them that you have a point of common interest and that you’ve taken the time to actually read their profile.

A not so obvious side note is that the thing you mention shouldn’t be so obvious. If a girl mentions that she likes Star Wars on her profile, it’s a good bet that every geeked out fanboy on the site has already tried pushing the “OMG We both love star wars” angle, and she’s likely to have grown tired of the tactic. 

2)	It should ask an open ended question.

As in, not a question that can be answered with a simple “yes or no”. Since we’re trying to engage this person in conversation, it would be best if we elicit an actual response out of them. If your question requires someone to think about how they feel about something, they are going to invest more in that interaction. 

For example: the other day somebody noticed on my profile that I liked the book Heart of Darkness, and asked me if I knew that it was the basis for the movie Apocalypse Now.

My response was “yes”.

Now, if instead they had asked what I thought of Heart of Darkness, or how I felt about the book’s translation into film, they would have received a much more well thought out response, and I would have been far more engaged in the conversation. 

3)	It should be light in tone, and brief.

Here, brevity is going to be our friend. The more you talk, the more chances you have to screw something up. Really, you should be able to say everything you need to say in 3 to 5 sentences. 3 to 5. That’s it. That’s more than enough time to indicate you’ve read their profile, ask an open ended question and do some light flirting. 

Why so short? Well, two reasons. 

One, even with working to optimize our chances of success here, the truth of the matter is, a good number of the messages you’re going to send out still aren’t going to get responses. Dumping an hour of your life into that perfectly crafted three page introduction is likely to be effort wasted.

Two, you shouldn’t think of this first message as anything more than an attention grabber. The only real goal here is to get this person to read your perfectly crafted profile, and once they figure out they like what they see, give them a good excuse to write you back.

At no point during your first message should you ask for their name, personal contact information or push to meet in person. These things are almost always interpreted as being too aggressive and will likely get you shut down.

Now keep in mind, all of these are guidelines, not rules. There will be times where it will be appropriate to modify them, or throw them out the window entirely.

1374030054.0,69,self.relationship_advice,1iglhc,"I (23f) Got a love letter under my door from a neighbor (60m), boyfriend (22m) and I are unsure how to handle it.",creepedoutthrowaway1,96,27,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1iglhc/i_23f_got_a_love_letter_under_my_door_from_a/,"To set the backstory, My boyfriend (22), myself (23F), and my daughter (2) moved in together a little over a year ago into a rinkydink 5 apartment building in the middle of a pretty bad town.  He was finishing up his last year of college, and we planned to move out once he finished. However I work in a career that is largely dependent on your customer loyalty and I work off of commission and tips, and I'm doing pretty well for myself here, so I decided to stay here while he moved back home to his moms in between now and when he found a job, and transfer to another store once we have somewhere more permanent to live. It was a really hard decision to make and my daughter and myself have been having a really hard time being without him but I feel it's better for my daughter and myself. This way, she doesn't have to leave all her friends at her daycare, move somewhere else, only to move again, and I can continue with where I am at in my work. My boyfriend has a few job interviews, and it does seem as though we may be leaving here soon.


Now, when we moved in we met our downstairs neighbor, a roughly 60 year old man, who seemed like a really nice guy. His door is right in front of the only entry/exit to the building. I would always say hi to him, talk to him in passing, about his girlfriend or his kids (older than me) or whatever else came up. Whenever he saw my daughter he'd give her a little piece of candy or let her pet his cat. But we never spent too much time with him, once, early on when we had moved in, my boyfriend and I had dinner over at his apartment because his roommate was a supposedly chef at one of the nicer restaurants in town. However, usually our interactions were under 5 minutes. This week, I mentioned to him that we may be leaving, but aren't really sure yet how everything is going to pan out. Just making conversation with a neighbor.

Today, after I had put my daughter to bed, I noticed a piece of paper slipped under my door. When I picked it up, it was a letter. From my neighbor. It said things in it that made me very uncomfortable. He called me a 'celtic princess', said that ""when he sees me, his grey matter goes out &amp; his knees &amp; thoughts seem to abandon him"". Then he goes on to say: ""Would love to be the one to brush your hair out at night, snuggle you close &amp; slowly kiss you goodnight. Now that you may be leaving I have to get this off my chest."" Along with a few other things, such as that he will miss my daughter when we leave. 

I told my boyfriend about it, and we both feel that it is probably better to completely ignore this and act like nothing happened, because I'm (hopefully) leaving soon and because from all of our interactions with him, he seems pretty harmless. Always thought he was just a nice older man. But I have to walk by his door every day, with my daughter, and he knows that my boyfriend has moved back home with his mom for the time being. I can't help but to worry... I'm unsure about how I should handle this situation. This hasn't been the first time that something similar to this has happened (an unrequited love situation), but I have been told before that people take me being friendly and having conversations or doing small favors (picking something up at the store) when asked to as flirtation. Am I wrong in ignoring it? Should I confront him, and/ or should I inform my landlord? Are there other steps I should be taking?  


Edit: I decided I may as well type out the whole note, as it may give some better context to the note itself.

My dad started seeing his friend which I honestly think is great and he's even moved in with her, but I do miss spending time with him. I used to consider him my best friend, but for the past year anytime I see him he has the new lady with him (who I have no problem with beyond this.) I miss him. I asked him about 6 months ago if we could spend time without his gf and he got offended. He told me he wishes he had met her years ago and he wants to spend all the time they have left with her. (What? He's 53 and neither of them are sick afaik... And if he was, wouldn't that extend to wanting to spend time with his daughter?) 

I pointed out that always bringing her around was like what my sister did when she first met her boyfriend and reminded him of how he hated that. I also reminded him that I've never made any of my boyfriends' presences a condition of mine. I then let it go and invited him to lunch when I knew she was at work to try to get some time where I could be myself without feeling uptight because a stranger was there. I still saw her 80% of the time I saw my dad and I've always been nice and friendly to her. 

Now on Thursday I asked my dad if we could go see World War Z just the two of us and he agreed to today. He picked the date. This morning I texted him about it and he replied that his phone was acting up. ""I have an appointment at 4:15 and I'll let you know when we are done.""

5 o'clock rolls around: ""We're done.""

My spidey sense was tingling. ""We're?""

""Me and Debbie.""

""Oh, is she coming too?""

""Yes.""

I told him, ""Oh. I was really hoping I could send some time with you alone for a change. I like Debbie, but when I go around the two of you it's really depressing sometimes because I feel like a third wheel. I like seeing her too, but it's been a long time since we did something just the two of us.""

We got in a huge fight after that. He basically told me (again) he wants to spend anytime they both have free with her. He said it would be rude to ask her to stay home. I feel like it was rude for him to invite her to the movie after I made a point of asking for just us. I don't expect her to stay home. She has daughters and a car of her own. She could make plans with them if she wanted to and he explained to her that it was a father-daughter night, but the problem I guess is that he doesn't want to. It really hurts my feelings a lot. I'm completely independent. I have my own house and pay for my own bills. I'm not asking for financial support or money. I just want him to spend some time with me without bringing his girlfriend. Is there anything I can do?

Tldr: My dad won't make time for me alone. He always brings his girlfriend.

Edit: Or will some people at least come validate my feelings? I feel awful and lonely right now. Rationally I know it's a bad way to look at it, but emotionally I feel like he's choosing spending time with his new girlfriend over spending time with me. 

Edit 2: I've talked to my mom about it and she says she thinks he's afraid to leave Debbie home alone when he knows she's not occupied with work because he's the insecure one and is afraid she'll go out and meet some other guy or something.

When we first met she had an amazing body and was fairly fit, which was one of the main reasons I fell for her. After she got pregnant we both gained an unhealthy amount of weight; most of the weight she gained even she will admit was from terrible over eating and not the pregnancy itself.

Since then I have gotten into weight lifting, have a huge passion for fitness and have improved my body ten fold; for both myself and to be more attractive to her. My girlfriend has not done the same. Everything in the relationship is great except for physical attraction. I am not physically attracted to her anymore and am actually turned off seeing her naked; and I hate myself for it. But I can't change how I feel. Physical attraction is VERY important to me, and its just not there anymore. I have a high sex drive yet find myself wanting to watch porn more often than actually having sex with my fiancé; I also find it harder to be physically affectionate with her as well and she notices. All of the feelings I WANT to have for her I can't. Emotionally it's there, physically it's not.

It feels like it is tearing me and the relationship apart from the inside and she has no idea(at least no idea how bad it is) and there is no way for me to tell her directly without hurting her feelings. I even find myself looking at other women who are thinner and it reminds me of how I may never be able to experience having a partner who can turn me on visually like that, and I'm only 25! What do I do, reddit? How can I go on and marry someone who I may never again be attracted to?

We're both in our 20's and I hate how she is allowing herself to go downhill at such a young age. I've tried indirectly helping her get fit but she gives up every time. I almost feel disrespected in the sense that she doesn't care whether she looks good for me or not, yet she likes to ask me to get completely naked during sex because ""you look so good naked now"".

We were talking the other night and we somehow got on topic of her exes (one of which raped her) and began talking more about her past.  I knew she had been raped at least twice before, but we've avoided discussing in detail exactly what happened.  
Well the other night when she brought up the first time she was raped, she mentioned that it was a complete stranger who did it. And when i mentioned that she hadn't ever told me about what happened, she responded, ""i don't want to/don't like talking about it."" which is completely understandable.  
However... I feel like it's eating away at me, knowing that something so horrible happened to her... my imagination runs away and all these scenarios run through my head... i barely slept last night, thinking about what may have happened, how it unfolded, etc.  But I don't know where she was, what the circumstances were, none of that.  All I know is that he tried to knock her out, she fought back long enough to get a good look at his face and he was later caught.  I don't know if he's still in jail or anything else.  
How do I cope with wanting to better understand what happened to my wife but at the same time, completely respect that she doesn't want to relive such a traumatic event?  When we talk about things like this (for example, the boyfriend who raped her) I want to know what happened... call it morbid curiosity. But it always effects me, making me depressed for a few days, making me literally sick to my stomach that this happened to somebody I love so much.  
I want to ask her for just basic details like, ""where were you when you were attacked? what were the circumstances? is he still in jail?"" but again, I don't want to make her uncomfortable by bringing up such a sensitive subject.  
Does anybody have experience/advice for somebody in my position?  
  
**Edit:** Thanks everyone for the support/advice/validation of my confused feelings. I'm definitely going to refrain from directly asking questions or being nosy and just continue loving my wife.  If she ever feels comfortable talking about what happened, of course I'll be there for her. But if not, I'll pretty much just have to acknowledge that it would be incredibly selfish of me to want her to relive something to painful.

We get to the party and my girlfriend asks to take the keys to my car so that her and her friends can go in the car to take some shots so they don’t have to pay for drinks at the bar. About 30 minutes later, she comes back and that is when things started to go bad. I saw her outside being flirty with a couple of guys, taking drags off a cigarette, and being completely oblivious to my presence and how her actions were affecting me. This is not the first time that something like this has happened, and I’m usually the forgiving type but I admit, I got very frustrated and wanted to leave.  

I asked one of her friends if they would be willing to give her a ride home since she rode with me, they had no problem with that. I went up to my girlfriend and asked for my keys from her and told her I was leaving and that she could get a ride with our mutual friend. Of course, she became visibly upset and very angry. She started calling me names and that I’m just a bitch and in reality, maybe I was, but before things got out of hand, I really just wanted to remove myself from the situation. 

I asked my girlfriend to follow me to my car so she can grab her stuff and give me my keys. She keeps saying that she is absolutely not going to give me my keys because she does not want to be left alone with no ride back. She also told me that she could not find her phone and that she doesn’t want to leave without her phone. I told her again that I asked our mutual friend and that they would give her a ride home and that I would help her find her phone if she would just give me my damn keys. It just went in one ear and out the other. 

She proceeded to stand by my driver’s side door while I kept asking her for my keys so that she could grab her stuff and I can drive home. She kept saying no while becoming more and more belligerent. She kept repeating that there was no way she was going to give me my keys to my car because she doesn’t want to be left here and that she could not find her phone. I told her again that she has a ride home and that if she gave me my keys, I would help her find her phone. She completely ignored what I said and at this point, I tried to grab her purse so that I could get my keys from them and she immediately freaked out and told me to get my fucking hands off of her. This is when I completely lost my cool and slapped her. It wasn’t a slap with my palm but rather the tip of my fingers on her cheek. I honestly do not know what came over me. I know I should have restrained myself better but with the combination of seeing her flirting with a couple of guys, her refusing to give me my keys to my car while acting very belligerent with her eyes glazed over, I just lost control. I completely understand that what I did was wrong. 

She then proceeded to lose her shit. She started kicking me, punching me, scratching me, ripped my shirt, threw my glasses on the ground, all while yelling “How dare you hit me! How dare you hit me!” This lasted about 10 – 15 seconds while I kept telling her to stop while pushing her away from me. Just for reference, I am about 5’11” and 180 pounds and my girlfriend is 5’11” and 160 pounds. It hurt, a lot. My glasses broke and I have scratches across my chest, neck, and arms. She scratched me enough to the point where a few of her fake pointy nails broke. 

I then immediately started jogging back towards the venue we were at so I could find our mutual friend so that she could help me resolve this. This whole altercation, from when my girlfriend started following me to the car, and when I slapped her and she hit me back probably took around 15 – 20 minutes. By the time I got back inside, I noticed I had two missed calls from our mutual friend and that she was calling to inform me that she and her friend have left and that she assumed that since she could not find me or my girlfriend, that everything was okay. 

I walked back to my car where I found my girlfriend sitting in the drivers seat while grabbing all her stuff and putting it in a trash bag I keep in the car for trash. After a minute or so of me asking her to open the goddamn door, she opened the door and proceeded to yell at me for hitting her. “How dare you fucking hit me!” she kept repeating. At this point, I saw no other solution besides driving her back home and just dealing with this in the morning. I told her to get the hell out of my seat so that we could leave. She kept screaming that she can’t find her phone and that she doesn’t know where it is. I went back inside and looked around and asked people but no one had any idea where it was. I went back to my car where she was sitting in the back with all her belongings stuffed in this white trash bag on her lap while crying. I told her I couldn’t find her phone and that I wanted to go. She kept repeating the fact that I hit her and that she probably lost it during our altercation. I looked outside and there was no phone. 

At this point I started video recording everything on my phone. I did not want to be put into a situation where it was my word against hers. She finally gave me my keys and we started to drive home. I honestly do not think I have ever been so emotional ever in my life as I was during the drive home last night. In all honestly, I probably should not have been driving with the way I felt. Not only was I hurt by her actions earlier, I was hurt by the fact that she kept putting the blame on me that I shouldn’t have hit her and that this was all my fault. I knew at this point there wasn’t much left of our relationship and with the way I was treated, I completely lost it and just started bawling my eyes out. For the next 20 minutes until I could drop her off, she kept repeating that she didn’t have her phone, how she couldn’t believe that I hit her, and how I was a bitch for crying. 

We talked today and she is still acting like she did absolutely nothing wrong. I explained to her and apologized for slapping her but that her actions before and after were not acceptable. After I explained to her actions last night when she was intoxicated and how devastated I was for how she was acting, she said that, “Well hopefully you think next time before you raise your hand at a woman” and when I said I slapped her because I felt provoked and that even though she was not giving me my keys and regardless of how you felt, there is no way in hell that she should have reacted the way she did, she said, “I will do that to any man that hits me… you’re lucky I didn’t do more”.

Some more things she said to me today are, “YOU ARE A MONSTER” “I cannot be with a man that hits me like a little bitch and rationalizes it” “you owe me 2 years of my life” “you hit me. so i hit you 20 times.” you made it physical… uhh i was agressive after you hit me...” “i would have never hit you if you hadnt hit me first” “YOURE SUPPOSED TO BE A MAN AND MEN DONT HIT WOMEN” 

I don’t know what to think or do anymore. I haven’t eaten anything today or left my bed. I’m extremely depressed and devastated at everything. On one side, I know I shouldn’t have slapped her like that, I know what I did was wrong, but on the other hand, I’m hurt by the way she reacted and proceeded to blame everything on me on the ride home. And in addition, our relationship is completely broken. Was I wrong for acting the way I did? I already apologized to her but she keeps blaming me and I don’t know what to do. 

tl:dr GF got drunk, did things I didn't like, I wanted to leave, held my keys / cars hostage, I wrongly reacted and slapped her, she proceeded to retaliate. Confused and don't know how to feel or what to do anymore.

My parents (both early 40s) have been married for just less than 20 years (not exactly sure), and in that time have had me and 3 more children. 

About a year ago, something changed between them, and my mother started acting a little weird. She would go out every night with her friends (often to a pub or the cinema) and snapped back at everything anyone said, even shouting at my youngest siblings, who are only 4 and 8.

My family, uncles, aunts, grandparents, all started to hate her, and I had no idea why. She would refuse to speak with anyone, and they only visited us when our mother was out - which was a lot.

My father left the house everyday at 5 to go to work, so went to bed at about 9 or 10, yet my mother would only get back at midnight. I knew for a while that they hadn't slept with each other for ages.

After a while it slowly dawned on me that my mother could have been having an affair. I ignored this, but after a pretty shitty Christmas, I decided to man the fuck up and ask my dad if it was true.

Yes, it was.

My mother used to have a friend who was an athlete or something, and had recently got back in touch with him. They started flirting via texts and emails, and eventually hooked up. They continued to do this. A lot. 

Then, I don't know what happened, but my mother did something that pissed off the athlete guy, so the athlete guy decided to get her back by trying to break up her marriage. 

He sent my father an email to his work computer, describing in detail what his wife did to him, and what athlete guy did to his wife. It also included an attachment of every single email they'd sent to each other, from the harmless flirting from last summer, to my mother describing how good it felt to be cummed into by him, and how much she loved fucking him.

My father was devastated - he was going to kill himself (I don't know how, I didn't ask) yet stopped at the very last minute because he realised that he didn't want his kids left alone with her. 

He doesn't want to risk breaking up with my mother because he's scared that she'd get us. My mother doesn't know that I know any of this and I'd like to keep it that way.He thinks his best bet is to just wait it out, but is really miserable and I'm pretty sure he's becoming depressed.

 Is there anything my father can do?

**First Topic**

I am a 28 year old quadriplegic who is tired of being rejected or instantly pigeonholed as a friend.  A recent let down has bothered me more than I expected, I have gotten pretty calloused about them in the past.  After this last one though, I decided to do a little self-reflection as to what I may be doing wrong or things that I can improve upon.  Following this trend I asked a few confidants on their opinions and they both brought up the possibility of my being disabled.  Is it that big of a deal?  I never really looked at my handicap as anything more than a “bump in the road” to be worked through.  I am not naive enough to believe it would not be a problem for everyone but is it enough to push me aside without ever trying?  The following [Reddit post](http://redd.it/9liuz) leads me to think it is a far bigger deal breaker than I imagined.
 
**Second Topic**

The last woman I asked out said no as she is seeing someone, her seeing someone came out of nowhere, not a hint of her dating someone in the two months that I have gotten to know her.  She has said she wants to hangout still as friends but I am not interested in this avenue, even if I do very much enjoy my time spent with her.  That being said, has anyone had luck with telling the other person that they are not interested in continuing as friends, but if at some point they want to try something more, they know where to look?

If you have any comments, opinions or question, I would like to hear them.  Even if they are not directly related.

I tell him something about applying for a loan, he says I'm wrong, we argue. A month later, he realizes I was right, and then proceeds with applying for whatever loan in the correct manner.

We chatted, she invited me to smoke a bowl in her car (which is kinda normal here in LA), we made out pretty passionately, then we both went home.  Seriously guys, good smoochin'. We were two puzzle pieces from the same box.

Last night, we go on our first date.  We have dinner, go to a bar, seems like we're having a good time (conversation was effortless and shared eerily similar world views).  All in all I'd say it was a great date.

I should mention: I didn't pay for dinner.  We got burritos, I paid for mine, she paid for hers.  Personally I feel like a chump paying in this day and age, however I think I saw her make a ""cheap bastard"" face so I just paid for drinks for the rest of the night (about $40).  She insisted on paying for a round, which was nice of her.

So I drive her back to her apartment, we chat for a minute and I lean in for a kiss.  Denied.  Okay...we chat for a little bit more, she's getting kinda handsy, so I decide to go for a kiss again.  Denied.  Okay fine, she doesn't want to kiss.  So we chat for a little while longer and she says ""I've been sitting here waiting for you to seduce me.""  I have no idea what this means.

So I just kinda stare, perplexed, and she looks at me all doe-eyed as if to say ""kiss me you fool.""  But I was just denied twice...I can't figure out what she wants.  I feel stupid admitting this, but at that point I went in for a third kiss.  We kissed, and it was just forced and dead at that point.

If you guys could help me understand, much appreciated.  I'm sitting here at work totally frustrated, can't figure out what to make of this.

TL;DR: Date seems to be going well despite the fact that I didn't pay for dinner, tried to kiss her at the end of the night, denied, followed by ""I've been sitting here waiting for you to seduce me.""

So Reddit, I got a story for you. It's not a happy one, I'm not too sad, its just a damn good one I hope I never top.


I meet this girl at a local coffee joint by my work, she's a barista. I think she's pretty cute, and we banter back and forth pretty good whenever I come in. After a few days of this, I ask for her number and shes smiling and gives it to me. I feel like a million bucks. I had never gotten a number under those circumstances before.


We go on 5 or so dates, shes amazing. We like all the same things. She watches football, plays Halo, pretty good with computers, active outdoors. She's very nice and we just mesh perfectly. I actually call BS on her liking football, just because I felt like she was lying to get closer to me. I quizzed her on a few things, and she clearly knew more about NFL than I did. So in my book she's the perfect woman, and she felt the same about me.


Yesterday I'm supposed to meet her after work. Work ends, she's not answering her phone or txt, which was very wierd for her. Her roommate works at the coffee shop so I walk over and talk to roomy, ask if she knows where GF is. She says ""Sit down, theres some things you need to know.""


She proceeds to tell me that GF is a compulsive liar, has a criminal record, and yesterday was charged with several crimes. She had this court date set for several weeks, and never mentioned anything about it. She says I will probably not see her again. 


I find her registered in the county jail, read the charges, talk to her roomy and compile the details. She was charged and found guilty of three counts of felony theft, posession of a forged document, and felony forgery. One of the charges was from a theft at the coffee shop, she had stolen the day I asked her out and was fired that day. She told me she quit becasue she had a great new job lined up (lie) in the medical field because she was pre med (lie). To get a felony theft, she stole over $1,000 from the Coffee shop.

When I first moved to the town she lived in, I was about 7 she was 5,her grandma told her that I was the boy she would marry someday. Shortly after that I was her first kiss. We didn't really date until high school, but we broke up after 3 months. After high school I was about to go overseas and long story short she was there for me when no one else was. So we got married. It has been great, we've seen parts of the world not all people get the chance to see. We have a beautiful daughter who will turn 3 this year. I thought life was grand. 
 So yesterday I was looking through my wife's phone, because lately I have been feeling like something is out of place. I found a few text messages that said I love you back and forth between her and some guy. I confronted her and she said that she hasn't had sex but they've kissed. She also took my daughter along with her when she went to see him. I love her so much, so I told her that she should stay with me and we should work on it. But I still feel absolutely horrible right now. I just needed to get that out. Also sorry about any grammatical errors, I don't type or write things out usually.
  
  UPDATE:
 This is what she has told me, it has been going on for about 3 weeks and she has sent him pictures. I have read and reread every comment, thinking about what you have all said. I should have told you all this in the first place but I am in the military and military fathers don't usually get custody. However, it doesn't matter right now because I love her too much to just let her go that easy. We are going to work on this, she has apologized, which isn't much but its a start. She has agreed to go to counseling or whatever else is necessary. I honestly don't believe that she has had sex with him. You all can call me naive and a fool, but I just can't give her up so easily. Thank you all so much, you've helped out more than you know. I just moved here and I don't really have anyone to talk to so coming to reddit has helped immensely.

This is going to be lengthy. Stay with me.

So, about a month or so ago my gf went to her sister's house  for a party. She has yet to come back. For the first few weeks she would respond to texts occasionally, yet vaguely. A lot of, ""we need to talk,"" yet no actual talking has happened. I am at wits end.

Background: We initially started dating when I had just freshly turned 21. I was an ass and she broke up with me. She gets married to an abusive prick, gets raped by his friends, gets thrown out by him with no shoes, spare clothes, phone, etc. They are still not officially divorced.

About 5 years after we had broken up initially, I end up going to my best friend's birthday party (her sister is engaged to my best friend at the time) We hook back up. She was the one that got away and I got her back! Awesomeness and three days of making out on her sister's couch ensues. Fastforward a few months and she's moving in with me. She was living in the middle of nowhere with her aunt and I live in the city (job opportunities).

She eventually gets a job. I am stoked. She breaks up with me two months later, citing reasons like; not ready, need space, wants time to herself. I get it. Start to move on with my life. A month or so later we hook up again. (It's meant to be at this point, yes?) 

With no income, she can't pay rent on her own. So, like a sucker, I let this girl move back in with me. At this point I am paying for her phone ( I was dumb and put her on my account 6 months after we had first gotten together again), paying the rent and electricity for the apartment we shared, buying groceries, buying smokes, buying booze, etc.

Fastforward to about 5 weeks ago: She went to her sister's house (allegedly) and hasn't come back. For the first few weeks she would text me every now and then, but didn't really say much. Things like, ""Haha! I'm busy doing stuff. Gonna try to get a ride home when I can."" Lately, she has stopped responding to my texts and calls. 

Fun part: I am still paying for our shared phone bill, most of her shit is still sitting in my apartment, still have not heard from her in over three weeks. I can deal with a break up, but it's hard to move on with no response. I don't want to just toss all of her shit out, but it's almost gotten to that point. I am having trouble proceeding from here. I'm not sure if I should try to play nice and be an adult about this, or light everything she still owns on fire.

Sorry if this got lengthy, but I have no fucking clue how to proceed and needed a good rant.

tl;dr 2: thanks for reading

I want some advice on what to do about my situation.  I am at wit's end at the moment.  

My ex and i mutually broke off our relationship last year.  I just couldn't get along as a couple so we decided to call it quits before things got ugly.

About 3 months ago my ex wanted to meet up and become friends again.  We did and it was a good time.  We have genuine fun together.  I eventually introduced her to my current roommate and our friends circle.  I started to get old feelings back and this make things a bit awkward when she was around. I slowly got more and more uncomfortable about her being around. This was accelerated when she started coming to the bars with us.  (~3 weeks ago) She has always been kinda flirty with everyone while she's drunk.  It's just her personality.  I did give warning that I would be very uncomfortable if she ended up sleeping with one of my friends.  She promised she won't do anything and that I had nothing to worry about.  I told the same thing to the roommate not long after.  The flirtation escalates.

Jump to one week ago.  Her, my roommate, a group of friends, and I go to the bars and get tispy.  The two are all over each other and I am so disgusted that I leave.  Making a scene isn't really my thing.  I opted to send the ex a lengthy text telling what was up and saying I was no longer cool with her hanging out with my circle of friends.  I had no reason to believe that they were doing anything or that I held any animosity towards here.  Just a clear message to stay away becuase I need distance.  They both assure me the next day that nothing happened. 

Two days ago I found out what really happened.  My roommate dropped the bombshell.  The two made out for the first time after I left the bars.  Since, they have be hooking up and sleeping together despite my explicit objections to it.  He gets back from work and finds me in the kitchen.  He says, ""I know you're not cool with it but, EX and I are going to start dating and we've been seeing each other for the past week.""  That was pretty much it and he leaves to go see her.  It hit me hard.  I am internally outraged, but i keep my cool.  I tell him to never, under any circumstances, talk about her in my presence or bring her anywhere near our apartment.

To clarify.  I had my suspicions all along, but it was finally presented to me two days ago.  They have been sleeping together since I sent a text telling her to stay our of my friend group.  (I'm starting to get the idea that she hooked up with the roommate out of spite to me.  It was the same night I told her to graceful leave the friends group. That night when she got the text she put on her puppy dog eyes and confined in the roommate.  They were drunk and made out and the rest is history.  That's just me I don't have anything to back it up.)
  
I've been kind of sick to my stomach the last two days rolling the idea of them in bed together. 

Any advice would be appreciated.  Thanks

Edit: The text that's gotten me in trouble wasn't quite like I remember it. The part in question is this, ""Hey Ex. I want you to be the first to know.  I'm no longer comfortable around you. I'm sorry.  I've tried to be accepting of you being one of us, but I can't take it anymore.  Too many old feelings have come back.""  The rest is just saying I feel like shit about this and I'll miss her being around.  Yeah, looking back, that was dickish.  I just paraphrased it horribly and ended up looking like a bigger asshole. 

 And thanks to all of your advice.  Some of it was advice that was hard to accept, but very much needed.  ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1372866191.0,,,True,t3_1hkc22,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hkc22/my_roommate_is_dating_my_exgirlfriend/,

We have all our emails set up on our windows 8 computer. He accused me of being rotten and evil and blah blah blah, yet he goes through my emails and I could care less.  
  
Secondly, he was getting discharged from the military and I had moved a state away to live with his mom. I got my wisdom teeth pulled, and had a huge crisis. I was unconscious/unresponsive for two and a half days before his mother called 911 for help. I ended up with a pulmonary embolism, going septic, liver enzymes going crazy, rhabdomylosis, He never once made the drive up to see me, even though I was there on a weekend, and he could've. And when he did finally see me he was angry at how anxious I was and how I kept let nurses try and set up IV's on me to get the right meds and fluids in. He got so angry he left me.  
  
Fast forward, anytime I get sad or anxious he tells me I need to calm down or that I am freaking out or that I'm a serious sally. I told him today he's really hurting my feeling and I wish he'd stop. His reply was ""you're hurting your own feelings."" But then he goes on about how I make him feel embarrassed in public and he has a sixth sense that others don't like being around me and that I am socially awkward, yet I have a very healthy social life outside of this marriage.   
    
Anytime we fight he calls me vulgar names, he imitates me like with a ""witches voice"" (same voice he uses to imitate his ex wife) and he just puts me down). I don't know what to do. He's asked me three times this week if I want a divorce, and when I say yes, he says well I am too lazy to fill out the paperwork.

Maybe dehydration but not starvation. Or can it? I don't have enough medical knowledge to really know these things. I have never seen a picture of this child, nor have I ever heard any of his family talk about it. I understand its normal to not talk about a child's death but this is as if the kid never existed. I asked about how the kid was left alone and he said that his ex girlfriend (the baby's mother) left the kid alone in the apartment after he refused to give her extra money after child support was paid. He said she wanted it for clothes. He said he was out of town working while it happened. He said the mother is now in prison.  This seems like a big red flag to me but I don't know what to do. I am so happy with this man. He's really good to me. But why would a person lie about having a child and then saying it died?  I don't feel comfortable asking for details because its such a tender subject. He cries whenever he talks about his son. Which leads me to think he isn't lying. It just sounds so far fetched. Or am I just being skeptical for no reason? Can anyone tell me why he might have lied and why a lie that is so outlandish. Could he just want sympathy because he has low self esteem?

Nothing 'official' but it could go that way if a few things get worked out first. 

Wall of text.... Sorry...

The big one, for me anyway, is the sex. I'm.... Well, I've been told that I'm a slut. I own it because I hate the stigma of that word and never use it myself, but I sleep around when I'm single. I enjoy all sorts of sex, positions, toys, whatever, I'll try it. I always do my best to make sure mutual orgasms are had, and if it's not from penetration? Well, I absolutely love going down on her so it's not really an issue.

The issue is that the only position she's willing to have sex in is missionary. She's 5'5"" and weighs 115lbs, I'm 6' and weight 250lbs. I'm a pretty fit guy but our sex can last for 30-60 minutes and I NEED to move around, not only because I'm afraid of hurting her, but because I get tired being on top the whole time! On a purely sexual, objectifying note, she's gorgeous and has a beautiful body that I want to be able to look at when we're having sex!

My favourites position is doggy style.. I suspect I'm not alone in this, and it's the easiest one for me to maintain for a long period of time. I asked her why she refuses that position and she said that it hurts her. I get that, I'm a relatively big guy and a few times have had to leave her alone for a few days when I forgot to be careful, but she also said once when she was drunk that doggy style is 'gross'. No other explanation offered... I know she's had some abusive relationships in the past, physical and emotional, and I suspect that part of it is this reason.
The hurting her bit I can work around, there are a lot of ways to make sure it doesn't hurt for her, but if she has some psychological issue about a position other than missionary... I don't really know how to go about fixing that, or even if I should try...

She is beautiful and hasn't cheated.  She's super sweet and hard working.  She's caring.  

Truth be told, I deal with anxiety and shit and can be moody.  NO EXCUSES.  I'm just telling you guys this.  This is probably my fault.

Anyway, I'm going to get stuck with lots of bills and shit like that.  I know there are going to be technical issues with all that.  I dunno.  Fuck it.  My head is spinning.  I stupidly went to a bar, made a loud joke that wasn't insulting, a large man took offense and tried to beat me up, and the cops were called.  I was the one who wasn't the regular and the cops listened to the majority.  I made them look stupid and busted out my video phone - that shit works on them, actually (smart, right?  no - not smart, douchey).

Anyway, I'm in the doldrums of depression at 4:45 a.m., don't know how tomorrow will go and I know this Subreddit is used to this, with its throwaway accounts.  Literally, I found myself laughing hysterically, downtown last night, on a sidewalk, watching fat tears fall from my eyes.

I know the whole delete Facebook (never had one), hit the gym (already run, but my wife has started gyming over the past few months - weird coincidence), and lawyer up (good advice).

I know I'm rambling, but here's the thing.  We have dogs.  We live in a shit town in the Midwest and I plan to get out of here as soon as the house (my mom's) is sold.  My mom lives somewhere else and we rent from her, but I won't leave her high and dry.  I'll keep up the payments.  

My dogs love both of us.  My old dog, though, is blind.  She knows who is whom, however, and can make her way around the house.  That has to change, obviously, since things will change.  My MAJOR problem is that my wife and I will not be together anymore.  So the older dog will be dealing with new surroundings, her boss's boys (not the calmest or ""nicest"" kids), and won't have me.  Honestly, the dog sort of sticks with me a lot of the time, but also loves my wife.  The younger dog loves both of us, but I'd say she's 60% partial towards my wife.

What do I do?  I'm dying here, people.  I'm breaking down as I write this because I feel that I can do something about everything else but my dog.  I'm scared for her and feel totally fucked.  She's blind and just trying to do her thing.  She bumps her way along and I don't even know if I should try to avoid her to help her get used to not being around me anymore.

Honestly, I want to walk out and keep walking and vomit and apologize to the guy who tried to fight me and the cops who had to deal with me and my mom who is going to flip and fucking everybody for everything.  Feels pretty bad and this blows and I'm fucked on money and I know nobody in this fucking town.  I went for a drive and thought, ""Well, I'll swing by somone's house.""  I don't know anybody.  

And you know what?  I went downtown.  We have churches.  I'm agnostic.  But I wanted a fucking chapel to sit in.  I didn't realize churches locked their doors.  In some small town in the Midwest they do, too.  Why is that?  Kinda needed it, but some shithead will vandalize or steal from them.  That's why, I guess.  It's a shame they have to lock them.

I'm breaking down and am afraid my dog will break and I know I'm not the first or last.  And to anyone in the same boat, I'm sorry.

Very confused.,anonbunnies,96,29,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/19gnke/43f_married_to_42m_and_in_love_with_best_friend/,"I've known and loved ""Jane"" for 15 years. She is beautiful, kind, loyal, and has literally never been loved by a single soul in her entire life. (Insane family, abuse of every kind, the kid in ""a child called it"" had it easy compared to Jane. Dead serious. ) from the day I met her until this moment we have shared a bond as strong as any I have ever experienced. And I love her. So much. Never have gone a day without her on my mind in 15 years. I've always been affectionate. Lots of hugs, compliments, support, praise. Maybe even more physically affectionate than most people would consider normal for friends.

I've been married for 17 years to Joe. Rough times. Good times. I can honestly say the last two years have been the best in our marriage. Very solid sex life. 

I've never had physical attraction to females. Never kissed another woman in a  way. Ive had a lot of sexual partners - maybe two dozen? Always loved sex. Adventurous. Bold. I'm pretty open to new things. There ar e a few women celebrities I think are hot, but its not like they're in a spank bank in my head. ( that space is reserved for Jake Gyllenhal)

Jane has never had a consensual sexual relationship. Never. She has several terminal diseases. One disease is AIDS. Has had them for eight years. She's pretty healthy right now, but there have been many close calls. I don't know how I could live without her.

 Mentally she's learned so much, matured so much, but she's carrying a lot of abuse related baggage. So it took her 14 years to build enough courage up to tell me she loves me. Not just loves me, but is in love with me and has been for many years. 

I'm not afraid. I'm not dismayed. I'm not disgusted. What I am is confused. About me, about the fact that the way I love her is exactly the way she loves me. Completely, without reserve or limits or judgment. No boundaries could ever exist. If she ever touched me sexually ( and with her history it would have to be her initiative) I know it would be completely natural. And beautiful. She is my heart.  We have talked openly about this for a week.

Can you love someone so completely that gender just doesn't matter? Because that's what it feels like.

 Joe has thought for years that Jane was in love with me. I may have been too naive to think there was a sexual component or the type of love didn't matter to me. It just ""was"". Joe always said what happens between me and Jane, no matter what it is, including sex, is our business. He knows I love him and desire him. He loves Jane too, always has. He even said once that if I could give her the love she needs I should, because she's not going to be with us forever and he wants her to have every chance at happiness. He said what Jane and I have isn't threatening to him, he wouldn't consider it cheating. But i wonder if he'd want to know. I don't like to lie or withhold the truth. And there are multiple STI risks. 

And Damn it. I wasn't going to disclose it yet but it happened last night. She kissed me. I kissed her back. We have always cuddled and held hands at times but this was amazing. Hours of being so close and if she was a man there absolutely would have been sex. I know that sounds hopelessly hetero but I'm telling you if there had been man parts involved I would have lost my mind completely. Except she wouldn't have done it because of the illnesses.  I can't deny I love her in every way possible. And even though I don't find women in general sexually appealing, the person I love is in a woman's body and i love her body because its hers. And i can stop, but i don't want to. I want to give her everything I can give. 

 So I'm stuck. I don't feel like I can tell Joe without it being a betrayal of Jane. Joe already gave it the green light because he always suspected it would happen one day.  Jane loves me too much to put me at risk so things won't go beyond a safe level.  And I'm beginning to believe in my heart and soul that gender is inconsequential and love is love, and sex is just a physical expression of it all. And the strangest thing is, I've always loved her this much, yet it never changed my relationship with Joe. 

Any words of wisdom out there for me?

So, some people wanted updates on this, so here I go.
After a week or so of weird chats with her, telling me that it was all ok and blah blah. I was really tired of talking about that topic. After some days, we finally changed the topic.I seemed like she was actually ok with me. I asked If I could go to her house (1 or 2 hours from where I live) to what she said yes. The day after, we met. Everything was pretty good. It was like nothing really happened. She was happy and all smiley. Let's make this shorter. There was nobody home except for her when I got there. I really didn't have any intentions after what happened last time. But apparently her mind changed a lot from the last time. She hugged me and started to kiss me and put my hands on her ass. I guessed that it was a green light for me. Anyways. We watch Fight Club and then had some dinner. When I was about to leave, she tells me that she wanted me to spend the night there because it's dangerous, and it was raining. To what I said yes, why not. I told her that I was gonna take a shower. To what she said ""Wait for me"". My heart literally stopped in that moment. We showered together and then we went to bed. We started to kiss each other. Turned the lights off (her mom was sleeping) and we had sex. It was beautiful. After what I thought were 10 minutes (but were actually 4 hours), she had an orgasm and screamed pretty loud. Her mom got up and saw both of us on bed. Although she didn't say anything, I think that is the last time I would be able to go there. She went to her room and we both went to sleep. 
I have no idea what happened to her. But she seems like a different person. In part I have to say thanks to you all. This is all thanks to the advice of many of you.
Sorry for my english.

This week, we were so mad at each other that he slept on the couch for the last two nights. This morning, he decided to come into our room where I was sleeping, masturbate while standing by the side of the bed, and ejaculate on the ass of my pajama pants while I slept without saying a word. I don't know how to react; I feel violated and creeped out. Any ideas on why he thought this was a good plan of action? 

Update: additional info to answer everyone's questions.
I have known my husband for 11 years. My husband and I were best friends from age 14 to age 19 when we started dating. I had a child from a previous relationship the same year we started dating, so we have been parents together our entire relationship. I also became pregnant the year we started dating, so we currently have a 5-year-old and a 6-year-old, both boys, who just happen to have autism. We have been together for 6 years in total, but just recently finally got married in August of this year (we weren't delaying the marriage for any specific reason). We also moved 2hrs away from our home town 2 years ago. So stress: we have no time to be a couple to ourselves, we are away from everyone we know, and our kids have autism; with the oldest the autism is a minor issue but our youngest is nonverbal and severely delayed, so he has hours upon ours of therapy a day, a multitude of problems, and I spend a large part of my time being CEO of his life. The household chores argument comes in when my husband doesn't think he has to help out because he works, never mind that our children take up the majority of my time and create a lot of stress. We had this same problem even years ago when I was also working and attending full-time college. Back then, he thought he worked harder for longer hours. Our house isn't even that dirty; I know other housewives with normal children or no children who have filthier homes. Sex has been denied because of how he treats me, and because he constantly pressures me about it which is very off-putting. We do still do it occasionally when he doesn't come home and act like an ass! We just can never seem to do enough for each other and he resorts to name calling, yelling in front of the kids, accusing me of doing nothing all day, etc. 

I like all of the joking comments, I really needed the humor. And as for those that call this sexual assault, I'd have to say I agree which is why he is not currently living with us. I agree that he probably did it as some kind of psycho power play, and also because he knew it would make me absolutely livid. He was awake, and admitted to doing it, but I'm so disgusted and mad that I haven't even asked for the explanation. I sent him resources from a counseling book, and supposedly he is going to look for help. I'm concerned that it won't work. Of course I knew that this was not normal behavior; just wanted some ideas through the eyes of outsiders. Thanks everyone! 

Update 2: I asked him why he did it, I said ""was this a sexual thing somehow or were you trying to piss me off?"" He said sexual and I asked how, I said: ""I was laying there in boring pajamas, probably snoring. How was that sexual?"" He said ""Your butt looked really good. And I knew it was stupid right when I was done. It wasn't meant to make you mad. I know I shouldn't be doing anything sexual that you don't invite."" 

I reiterated to him that this could be considered sexual assault, and that he shouldn't be doing anything to his wife that he wouldn't do to a stranger. He said he agrees. For now he is back living with us, seeking counseling on his next days off, and I will be installing a lock on my door to use when I am feeling uncomfortable. :/ ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1351041376.0,,,True,t3_11vwa9,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/11vwa9/ladies_and_gentlemen_of_reddit_is_this_a_normal/,

We get along really well, but I'm on the verge of being in the friend zone. A couple weeks ago, I started asking her out on dates and we've gone out probably 3 times. I (unfortunately) failed to make a move every single time. The opportunity never presented itself, or at least it never seemed to have presented itself.

Anyway, this past Friday we went on another date.  The opportunity didn't present itself again, but this time I accepted the fact that it was never going to happen between us. This was the problem: we get along so well on a friendly level, that if I were to make a move it would result in potential awkwardness.  We get along so well, that there is absolutely no sexual tension. Anyway, after we went out on Friday I accepted that. Even though I accepted the fact that we would probably never be together, I still can't help but have feelings for her. We get along so well, I don't think I've ever connected with someone the way I connected with her. 

So here comes Saturday night, my friend is having a cookout. She shows up, fuck, I'd rather just not be around her for the time being. After the cookout my friends and I go out to the bar, she drives separately and meets us there. After the bar, she goes home with my best friend and he closes the deal according another friend of mine that was also staying at his house.  I'm supposed to go on a trip with my best friend this weekend, plane tickets already purchased. 

I'm really trying to get over this. I'm telling myself that it wouldn't work out between her and I anyway, but I can't shake this awful feeling.  It just feels like someone shot a bullet through my chest. I could probably use a xanax but don't have access to any. 

Last paragraph: My friend texted me today and asked if I wanted to meet up after work to get food and discuss the details of our trip.  All of the details have already been worked out so there is really nothing to discuss in regards to that. He knew that I had been talking to this girl before he hooked up with her on Saturday night. He's done this type of thing before except it was with another friends long time girlfriend (shortly after they broke up).  So in regards to meeting with him after work; I believe that he wants to discuss what happened and probably apologize. 

Can anyone please provide some input here? I'm kind of lost and feel like shit about everything right now.

I have always been very self conscious about my body, and have struggled with bulimia for several years. I have not purged since mid-December. My boyfriend knows about it, but clearly does not understand it in the slightest. He tries to be supportive, but I can tell he just thinks I'm dumb because ""why don't you just *not* throw up?"" was his solution.

He is incredibly understanding and supportive in all other aspects of our relationship. 

My weight has fluctuated quite a bit. I was about 150 when we started dating, and managed to hit 135 around this past Thanksgiving. I have since gained it all back, plus five pounds. I of course feel shitty about this, and think about it *all the time*.

My boyfriend had always told me that he loves my body and that he finds me very sexy. It took me a long time to feel truly comfortable being completely naked around him, walking around, etc.

Recently he's made several comments like, ""I really liked your body around Thanksgiving. I mean, I like your body now, but I *really* liked it then"", or ""your stomach has gotten bigger"", (he didn't get why that one bothered me *""because it's true""*), and most recently, when I said we should stop by my favorite frozen yogurt place, he responded with ""no, I'm not going to enable you getting fatter"". He didn't say it in a malicious way, almost like he thought it was a joke. Doesn't matter... this last one shattered my confidence. Completely. 

I always thought I could count on him to love me the way I am because that was always the impression he gave me. It wasn't until recently that he started making these comments. He knows that last one bothered me. He tried to explain that he likes the way I am now, but is afraid of me getting too big to the point that he isn't attracted to me anymore. WHAT THE FUCKING FUCK?? He's more overweight that I am (at least I think... I have pretty skewed perceptions of my own body that bounce between ""I'm fine"" and ""I'm the most disgusting person on the planet""), and I've never made a comment about his weight. I always tell him that I love his body. Where is his concern coming from all of a sudden?

Is he justified in acting this way? It just feels like a huge slap to the face. My stomach has been in knots ever since (it was two days ago), and I've been struggling with going back to bulimia. I always thought I would never let someone talk to me this way, but I also thought my SO would be the last one in the world to do it.....

EDIT

Just to vent...

I really don't want to break up. I love him. But these past few days have been terrible and I have no idea how to explain my view to him in a different way than I already have... I just don't feel comfortable around him in the same way.

Every time he looks at me I feel like I have to re-position myself so my stomach is less noticeable. Last night we had sex for the first time since his comment (two days is a pretty long time for us to go without sex. our relationship is long-distance and we have only been back together for a week now), and he told me to get on top. He started holding my hips and touching my stomach. I think he was doing it to try and tell me that he's ok with my body because he knows I've been really upset, but it just made me want to cry.

This is a throwaway account. And a story of madness. And love. And trust.
Alright, so I have a question and would like your opinion on the matter. From time to time it keeps me awake at night and gives me angst, and quite frankly I don’t know what to do. 
I guess I could start with some info about me. I’m a quite normal male in my thirties, with a fair line of failed relationships in the past. Three unfaithful women (one of them should really count as twice, but hey shame on me) in the last four “long” relationships (2+ years each). To say the least this has fucked up my trustlevel quite a bit. And surprisingly enough left a quite humane, fair, view on women nonetheless. Was a bitter cunt tho for awhile, I got over it.

Now, I met my current girlfriend just a couple of months ago. Frankly, I had given up the whole idea of having a relationship when I met her, but things just clicked. To say the least, this woman is the one I want to marry and get kids and a dog with. Sure, been in love with the ones before her but not like this. We just went into this punch-drunk love-mode. For me, it’s the only person I’d like to bare myself for, the only friend I want to spend my entire day with, and the only one I have the focus and interest in knowing entirely. Now, You might think “hey, wtf why are you baring yourself now then?”. Well, going through my phonebook I realized I have absolutely no one to talk to about this, without the possibility of fucking up relationships with this woman and x friend later. I can add to this story that we have a distance relationship, because of work, and can only meet a couple of times a month for the time being.

So, anyway, everything was going awesome until she met this guy online to purchase some things she’s very interested in. Guy is a broke artist, lets leave it at that. And all of a sudden they are friends on facebook. And all of a sudden she brings him up. Like a lot. Like every day. Like every other topic we have is about him. So I ask her if she shouldn’t focus a bit more on us and tone it down. She wonders why this is so much of a problem. I tell her I don’t care about the guy at all. She’s says they are friends. After talking for a week. She tells me how he tells her that he feels so depressed. I tell her I’ve heard that story before. She tells me he wanted to come visit her, but since they are quite far from eachother aswell although living in the same area he needs to spend the night. I say nope. Now, for a guy whose been through quite a few things, this is starting to screw with my head. She wonders why I can’t trust her. I question his motives. She has a cup of coffee with the guy anyway. So she comes and visits me two weeks ago and she tells me she has broken connection with him since he had said that “she deserves to be with someone better then me, that my job is shit and I am stupid” and she wouldn’t tolerate that. So, I’m kinda relieved and relaxed by this, finally we can focus on things at hand, as he clearly has shown his motive. A couple of more days go by, and she says that she says she still gonna keep contact with him since they have so much in common. I blow me head off in silence. And so it continues. At least thirty minutes a day is spent talking about the guy. I just fall silent every time she mentions him, since it kinda kills all mood for any further conversation. They meet a couple of more times. I object, telling her to focus on us. She rants about me not trusting her, and it all goes haywire. To say the least, it’s all just blown out of proportion. About maybe an hour until I’ve decided that she can keep her friend and I just walk away, because this stresses me out, I decide to stop my whining and just go all-in and let her have her way. Since as I claimed before, I’m madly in love with this woman even though I can’t understand how she thinks and reasons. 

Alright, anyway. So he has visited a couple of times this week, and this weekend she went over to his place, since she felt lonely. And she spent two days there and slept in his bed. She says she loves me, and I believe and trust her, since it would drive me mad otherwise. Also nothing happened between them. And now as she was about to go to bed, she tells me he’s coming over to sleep there, since he felt angsty. So he’s there right now when I write this and that feels fucking great. And all this time she says she tries to make this easy on me, considering my past. And that it has been my behavior, that I’ve said he has no place in our relationship during this time and been quite pissed about the situation that almost took us to the brink. Her view was that I was trying to control her, and has been unreasonably jealous. When it comes to myself, if the tables were turned, I would had told that other person to fuck off permanently if she had slandered my partner, and just keep a casual communication to begin with instead of constant chatting, texting and calls. So, I changed my game because I believe in her, and us, and has forced myself into trust since I love her like a fat person loves pie. Since this is just a phase and soon I’m gonna be able to be by her side daily. Altho, I’d lie if I say that this doesn’t take it’s toll on my energy and patience. 

My question is; Am I a fucking idiot, or a sensible, understanding boyfriend? 

Thanks for your time, I just needed to get this mess of my chest. Feel free to share your stories of insanity in the name of love!

Tldr: Girlfriend talks, spends time and sleeps with male acquaintance, this drives OP semi-secretly mad and he questions reality.

edit: massive wall of text and details.

edit2: Can I just say it feels great to get some input on this, and (most of) you are reasonable and respectful in your argumentation. Basically, I've had no-one at all to discuss this with. Keep 'em coming.

UPDATE: Yeah, so it's over. I called her last night and told her what was on my mind and we had a long talk about things. She was sad that I felt she hadn't shown me proper respect, but agreed that she had let our relationship slip. She wanted us to be friends, but at least in the short run I can't see that happen.

Long story short, I am a 23 year old female and I was together with my ex (22) for about a year. Throughout our relationship I was rather selfish, I prefered going out without him and in general he was more into the relationship than I ever was. I did love him though, and still do, just not romantically.

Basically while we were dating (and prior to that) I was struggling with an alcohol-problem. Every time my boyfriend tried to bring it up I got defensive and told him he's not the person that can say what I need to change. Everyone around us noticed my problem as well and talked shit behind my back and just generally disliked me.

Eventually we broke up because I was simply not in love anymore. For some reason the breakup was also a wakeup call for me and I realized my ex was right all along. I immediately gave up drinking, started contacting my friends again saying I'm done drinking, started getting into new hobbies, volunteer at places, etc.

Everyone is noticing my positive change and I get complemented on it daily. The thing is, people seem to think that my ex was a bad influence on me and since we broke up, the ""negativity"" was gone and I got my shit back together.

Hell, as childish as it may sound, especially at our age, my ex got ""bullied"" out of a party saying he's a bad influence on me and that I was the reason for my alcoholism.

This really hurts me because every single bit about that is a lie. He is the most amazing guy a girl could wish for and he tried constantly to help me even when I got defensive and even started violence against him sometimes.

Is there anything I can do about this? I tell everyone that it's not right, that he hasn't done such a thing but they all think I'm just being nice for him

Title basically sums up the quick bits. I'm not good at explaining my feelings, so I will just sum up what has happened so far in the relationship. We are both the same age. Obviously a throwaway


We met about a month ago at a cocktail party I hosted, a friend brought her.  A bit of back story:



LEAD UP
------------------


We started chatting and seemed to have tonnes in common, cycling, same views, same attitude. We talked a lot about my being gay, she is also bi so we talked about her past relationships with women. That's all that really happened at the party, but we continued chatting over facebook and texts. 


A week later we went to a party togethor, but quickly left it after an h our to go back to my place. The plan was to have some drinks (comparing different gins) and just talk. At this point nothing has been said of attraction or anything. We got really drunk, talked about all sorts of personal items, how I'm atracted to the female form but don't think I could do anything with it, how she feels about men, etc. At one point we  moved to the couch and just listened to music in the dark until 4:30am, then she went to sleep on my couch and i went to bed. 


The next day was pretty normal, more talking, a nice lunch, then she went home.


At this point we started chatting more through texts, we were supposed to meet up the week after to go to the market, but that was cancelled as she had a date with a new guy. After the date I asked how it went and she said she had dumped him. I expressed sadness at this, but she responded with ""that just mean we can pickup togethor :) "". 


We scheduled a bike ride togethor for this past friday and continued to chat throughout the week. 



FEELINGS!
---------------------------------------------


This is about where I started to realize I had  feelings for her. She continually left little comments in her texts that made me feel she was flirting. I asked myself if It was possible for a gay male to fall in love with a woman. I asked some close friends for advice on the matter and they encouraged me to explore these feelings. I started to get so worked up over this that I stopped eating and sleeping. I didn't eat for two days, my heart rate was up, and I only got two hours of sleep in 48. 


Suddenly thursday this girl mentions that she is in town and asks what my plans are for the night. We schedule to meet at my place and go out for a drink, totally plutonic at this point. 



ADMITTION
--------------------------------


We never got out of my place, we just kind of started talking on the couch and I stammered out that over the last two weeks I had been feeling increasingly confused, and that I was having feelings for her. Romantic feelings. She laughed and hugged me. We talked about this for a while, I think she was trying to get a grip on exactly what type of feelings. She asked me what my reaction would be if she stripped all her clothes off right there, would it be a negative or positive one. I said I wasn't sure. (I later clarified this by explaining that my brain was telling me it would be wrong to be attracted, but the rest of my body was all like ""hells yea""). She professed that she had wanted to kiss me when we were drunk but hadn't, that she found me mature, smart, funny, and attractive.


We settled on the couch and started to watch a movie (Bridges of Madison County) and briefly talk while it was playing. We continually made eye contact and slowly moved towards each other. At one point she asked what time she should leave, as I had to work the next day. I responded with ""what if I don't want you to leave?"". She smiled and we cuddled for hours. 


When she left we hugged for ages. 



THE PRESENT WHERE I ASK FOR ADVICE
---------------------


We talekd through text the next day while I was at work. I said I would have kissed her but the wine had made my mouth dry, she agreed on this. There was lots of flirting going back and forth.


I called her later yesterday and we talked some more, I asked what she was seeing in this relationship, she asked what I saw in the relationship and wanted out of it. She said she wanted to see where it goes, while I said I wasn't sure. 


I think it was stupid of me to say that, I know what I want, but I am afraid of scaring her. I want friendship, adventure and companionship with her, I want her to be a part of my life and I want there to be an US. I want her. 


Now the scary part, is I have never had any long term relationships, especially not with a woman. In fact I have never been with a woman at all. I'm afraid that if we ever get to the smoochy smoochy stage, or god forbid a stage beyond that, I won't know what to do, or will do it so badly that I scare her off. I'm not sure how slowly I should be going or  how seriously she is taking me. If I start doing the usual romantic stuff, will she be scared off? When I am not with her, my brain just starts doubting everything. She's all I think about. Maybe she is only interested in friendship, can I handle that? WHAT IS SHE INTERESTED IN? OH god. 


EDIT: also as an addendum, the same thing apparently happened to her a few years ago. She fell madly in love with a woman she met and had a fairly long relationship with her. Hopefully that should help, in that she understands where i am coming from.


EDIT2: Your advice has all been great. It seems the overwhelming majority of opinions are that what I am feeling is normal for a relationship (That's good i guess!) and that I should just man up and go for it. That's the plan for Friday night. ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_hxe05,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hxe05/lived_last_seven_years_identifying_as_gay_now_i/,

I met a girl on a dating site and invited her to a shindig.  It went well.  Afterward she texted me ""I had a great time!"", which my sister says is ""code"" for ""ask me out again.""  This was when I first got squinty-eyed and thought, ""code? what world am I getting myself into?""  Anyway, we went out again the next weekend and it went really well.  That's good, right?  Hmmm...

Here's the thing.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I don't know what she's expecting or really what I'm expecting.  It's always made sense to me that two people get to know each other and start liking each other *before* dating.  This ""dating from scratch"" stuff feels hopelessly ambiguous and confusing with much room for jumbled expectations.  

So I'm half ranting, half looking for advice.  What are signals that I should be looking for?  How will I know if she's really interested?  We've texted a little every day since the last date, so I guess that's a good sign. And for the love of God, how will I know if she wants to be kissed?  How early does that happen?  Will she expect it by the third date or anything like that?  I'm really not that concerned about getting kissed/laid, so I'm willing to work on her schedule, but how do I know what that is?

TL;DR - I find dating a strange and intriguing phenomenon.  How do I do it?  How do I know she's interested?  How do I know if she wants to be kissed and what are usual timetables for that?  What dating is?

EDIT: Also, if a kiss should occur in the future, should I tell her it's my first?  I figure she'll find that out eventually, but I don't want to turn her off by the fact.

**EDIT 2:** Wow, thanks all for the responses and good advice.  We hung out tonight at the group thing and talked most of the time.  Afterward I walked her to her car, holding her hand for a good five minutes or so.  We have another date planned for Sunday and I might kiss her there, but I have a new question about that.
**New question:** I like everything about this girl but don't feel incredibly infatuated, lovestruck, head over heels, etc..  Am I supposed to feel that by now and is continuing to date leading her on?  Would kissing her lead her on?  If I feel more comfortable not kissing yet/want it to have more romance behind it, should I?  My sister says maybe I should just stick with holding hands for a while if I'm not sure I'm romantically interested.  Then again, we both tend to be on the conservative side with this stuff.

In fact, i'm crazy about her. However, whenever i make a mistake or say something she doesn't like, she'll shut me out and ignore me at lengths ranging from a few hours to a whole day or two. For example, she was telling me last night about this sixty year old bar owner she met with a nineteen year old girlfriend and how interesting he is. Needless to say i wasn't entirely thrilled at the sound of the guy and may not have responded with the most enthusiasm. I could see it upset her and i apologized immediately for it, but she'd already gone cold. When she finally got around to texting me today, she decided that she just didn't have anything to say to me and just doesn't feel like talking about anything for a while (however long that will be this time). That DOES hurt and i'm trying to be understanding and a good boyfriend but this just feels messed up. Maybe i'm being needy or something... I don't know. I'm just incredibly frustrated right now and i wish this wouldn't keep happening.


**Edit:**  So i talked to her.  I told her how i felt and how she can't treat me that way anymore.  She replied with:

*""I'm not going to change.""*

**So i sent her the following text message:**

*""If you truly love me and meant what you said about us having a future together you will.  You have to. I will be loving and patient but the silent treatment is not going to work with me anymore.  We are adults and we will behave like it.  You can't solve problems like this, and i'd rather you learn that with me then to let it affect your life.  You can be stubborn all you want but so can i babe.""*

She hasn't responded.  We'll see how things go and if she decides to end it, that's on her.  But I'm done being her walking mat, and if she continues this pattern or gets worse, i have no problem ending it.  I really do love her and care about her, because honestly she is a great girl despite her emotional issues.  and i guess i needed to learn how to give tough love.  Now's a good a time as any.  She knows that she'll have a hard time finding a guy as good as me and I guess this is a good reminder.  She also knows that I can get another girl if i wanted to and if this doesn't remind her of that then we really are screwed.  Either way, it felt good to get that out and hopefully things will start to get better.  Thank you for all your advice.  I finally feel like i've got my autonomy back.  You're the best reddit.  I needed a little tough love myself.  :D

**Edit 2:**  She's still being stubborn in conversation but her facebook status is currently: *""Change. Yup thats the word, its about time.""*

She comes from a family where it's just her and her mom...and whoever her mom seems to be dating at the time. Throughout her entire life, the mom has always had an older, well-off guy around that -for some strange reason- agrees to support her and her mom as if they were their own family. Examples include: paying for my GF's private school (elementary), buying the mom numerous cars, having the mom and gf move in with them, taking the mom on expensive trips, buying my gf expensive things, etc. I don't understand this. 

A little background on the mom: very traditional, has this 'men are the hunters, providers, and ""*thinkers*"" while women are the ""*feelers*"" mentality. She actually said that. Also, she says I'm a girl because I don't agree with this dynamic. 

While I don't think my gf is exactly the same, I do see a lot of these characteristics in her, which is only natural considering it's all she's known. 

So, anyway, the other day, my gf and I were talking about her mom and cars or something, and I said that I would never buy my gf a car. I see it as wasteful spending and I'd rather use the money for something else, like a trip. My gf stayed pretty quiet, so I asked what was wrong and she kinda went off on me, saying that its not right that I wouldn't buy her a car if she needed one. WTF, yo? 

I tried to explain that money has a utility value, and that when I spend a dollar on something, I'm voting with that dollar, saying that I believe the dollar is better spent on this rather than that. She didn't get it. So, naturally, she tells her mom about our conversation, and the mom responds with, ""the writings are on the wall"", and goes into how this is just another example of how Im feminine, and don't have the provider mindset. She continues to patronize me, saying that it's ok that I'm like that because thats how I was raised. I tried explaining to her my utility concept and how I believe the money for a car would be better spent on a trip or few, and she interrupts me, saying that its I dont make any sense because I'm basically saying, ""would you rather have a car or be able to breathe?"". How those two are the same, i dont fucking know. Anyway, wtf, reddit?

TL;DR: gf is mad that, *in imaginary land*, I wouldn't buy her a car if I had the money, and says that it translates into me not willing to be there for her and take care of her.

So a big thanks to kwb58 for checking in on this again... here's where things stand now.

We continued to go to therapy together... the therapist we were seeing turned out to be really terrible.  During one session I said I felt like the two of them were ganging up on me, and he told me that it was ""oedipal""... didn't actually address my concerns.  (Frankly, I think if you're a couple's therapist and someone says that to you, chances are you're a pretty bad therapist to begin with...)

Anyway, we stopped seeing that guy, and started to see a really, really good therapist.  We had a couple of sessions with him, and we started to address some of the underlying issues.  I could see a seed of how we might be able to work through this.

Then, a couple of things happened:  One day I get email forwards from a couple of friends who say ""your wife sent us this..."" and it was a link to [this article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2010/mar/07/polly-vernon-infidelity-betrayal-help-relationships) - (in short, it says how infidelity is now ""cool"" and we need to, as a society, rethink what it means to be faithful.).  My friends all took it as her saying ""Look, what I did wasn't so bad!"".  She sent this to, among other people, my best friend, his wife, our neighbors, and my mother.  I confronted her about it, and she said she just wanted to open people's eyes, but she didn't send it to me because she knew I would take it the wrong way. 

The next thing that happened really killed any chance of us working things out-  We had a joint cell phone account, and I could see her text message records (but not the content).  It was obvious that she was texting with someone constantly, and sometimes until late in the night/early morning.  I did some research on the number and found that it belonged to another musician that she knew.  I also found out that they had gone on at least one date.  I asked her who she was messaging with, and she wouldn't tell me who it was, and all she would tell me was that she was flirting with someone.  Keep in mind, I told her very explicitly that if we were going to work things out, neither of us were to start seeing anyone.

So that was what really did it for me-  I just didn't see how the hell I could put this back together when she was acting like that;  I felt that at every turn, she was piling more shit on top of the issue that I would need to look past if I wanted to save the marriage... I'm just not that strong.

So after that, we decided to sign separation papers.  Once we made that conclusion, a lot of the tension between us dissolved, and we could talk to each other like people again.  My landlord was really awesome and reduced my rent in exchange for moving into a different unit, and in the separation agreement, my wife was pretty good about letting me keep the majority of things.  

She has made several comments to me that ""we're just separated"" and ""we don't have to get divorced"", but I am pretty much resolved to divorce-  as I get further from the event, I actually feel pretty good about being apart from her... there is almost this weight lifted, like I can focus on myself instead of her.  I'm seeing my own therapist, and I've made it a point to focus on my feelings post-separation, and although I have had some really bad moments, for the most part I feel like I am coming out the other end already, and I'm a better person for it.

That brings us up to now-  Last week I asked a girl out on a date-  a friend of a friend that I met at a BBQ.  We had a really great time together, and actually spent the majority of the week-end hanging out.  I've been very up front with her about my situation, and she is aware that I'm not looking for anything serious, but all in all, I feel good about going out and meeting new girls.  

Again-  I wanted to thank everyone here for all the comments and support they gave me in the last two threads... there was some good discussion here, and I think it really helped me get through the really hard parts at the beginning.

I am a 29/m who is a novice with relationships. I have been happy on my own until this point but I decided to see what was out there and met someone through an online dating site. She, 27/f, is largely in the same situation as me and has very little dating or relationship experience. We hit it off after meeting for drinks and have been going out for about two weeks and started a physical relationship a week ago. We spent the day together yesterday, went out on a date, came back to my place and cuddled up on the couch, got intimate and generally had a lot of fun. When time came for her to get home, she got very emotional and teary. I asked her what was wrong and she said she was a bit overcome with how she felt about me and didn't want to leave. Then she told me she loved me. Now, I like this girl a lot and enjoy spending time with her but this was too much too fast for me. Even so, I had just finished consoling her and telling her she was special and I liked her and when she said she loved me I panicked. I didn't know what to say and didn't want to leave that just hanging and I said I loved her too. I know I shouldn't have said it without actually feeling it but I was caught off guard and it just happened. So now I feel like we are getting way too serious way too fast for me. I absolutely do not want to hurt this girl but I also feel like I have to be honest and I can't let her keep thinking I am in love with her if I am not. I am really stuck on where to go from here. How do I let her know I think we are getting serious too fast? How do I tell her I only said 'I love you' because she surprised me and caught me off guard? Should I get out of the relationship if she if feeling so serious so fast and I am not? Any advice would be so welcome.

**tl;dr**-- She said I love you too fast and I said it back without meaning it. Where do I go from here?

Update: We talked briefly on the phone and I laid out that I felt we were moving to fast and the 'I love you' came out because she said it and I didn't know how to respond. She was a little upset but we agreed to get together tomorrow for dinner and talk more in depth about how we both feel about the relationship and how to move forward if she is feeling more strongly than I am. I want to thank everyone that replied with kind words and advice. Hopefully I can clearly lay out my concerns and she can understand and accept them but if not I suppose I am prepared to break things off.

My husband and I have been married for 3 years. We have joint accounts and share everything. An investment deal recently came our way and he really wanted to do it. I didn't really want to because we have some credit cards I wanted to pay off first. After much arguing we decided that we would invest with the savings we have. I guess he didn't feel that that was significant amount because he went to the bank and got a line of credit so he could invest more. I found out after he had done the deal because he said he transferred some of his credit card debt to a new line of credit he got. That alone was shocking but then when I asked why he didn't transfer all of it (lower interest rate) he fessed up. Now I don't trust him and don't know what to do. I love him but I honestly don't want to be married to him right now.

Go figure this morning my current boyfriend deleted something and went to go clear the recycle bin and sure enough saw the picture and questioned me. This happened just a few minutes ago and I'm currently at work and he blatantly told me he's mad at me and is ignoring every one of my texts and phone calls. It was my mistake for not permanently deleting it in the first place but damn I didn't think he would go through the recycle bin the very next morning :(

My question is:
How can I fix this and explain in a way for him to understand that I had a previous life before him and he shouldn't be upset the way he is? I understand him being grossed out by it as I would be too if I found something of that nature of one of his ex's, but hell, to be truly pissed off at me for something like this is just ridiculous. He's very stubborn and this is something I imagine he'll hold against me. Whole situation is making me cringe thinking about it.

Any advice RA? It would be most appreciated.

Forgot to mention, he's 23 and I'm 22 and we've been together for a little less than a year now. Nothing similar has ever come up before. Maybe someone can help me understand his side of the situation? I don't get it. Maybe he doesn't believe me when I say I deleted it because I forgot about it and that's why he's upset.

QUICK UPDATE 10/21: I appreciate the insight a lot of you brought me as it's helped tremendously. Looking at it from his point of view I understand where he's coming from and how he might be feeling. Unfortunately, he permanently deleted the picture from the recycle bin before I even got home so unless he checked how old it was himself, I have no way of proving when it was from. He still refuses to talk to me or hear me out and when I asked him why he simply stated he doesn't want to talk about it. I made a comment about it being not fair and all he gave me was ""Life's not fair."" So from here, all I can do is wait and hope he clears his head and trusts me.

Female perspective appreciated.,throwawayweight2,76,9,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/zzgzj/girlfriend_26f_cried_during_sex_because_she_isnt/,"Hey all. Last night my girlfriend and I were getting into some foreplay. When we met she was very fit, but over the last year or so she's been putting on a lot of weight. Nothing drastic (She's 5'11 and I think around 230lbs), but overweight regardless. Personally I still find her beautiful, but it's incredibly obvious she's beating herself up over it constantly. 

Last night we were in some foreplay when she started crying. I stopped right away and cradled her, asking what was wrong. What I got was basically she doesn't feel sexy anymore and during sex lately all she can think about is how disgusting she feels. 

The thing is, I've been losing a lot of weight recently, just going to the gym twice a week and counting calories. I've lost twenty pounds in the last four months, and apparently just passed her weight. She's been very supportive of me, but hard on herself at the same time. 

I've been encouraging her, and she has kind of been half-assing my suggestions. We both signed up for a calorie counting site, she uses it about twice a week. She joined a local dance studio, she barely goes once a week. She's ashamed of how much she's gained (she was very fit back in high school) and too embarrassed to work it back off.

So, it's kind of a two layered problem. The important part is, losing weight will help her health and confidence. How can I help her with that. I understand she's the one that will have to overcome that embarrassment, but it's just really hard for me to be encouraging when she's so hard on herself.

I still ended it though. we talked for a few hours and she told me the truth about everything. i didnt tell her I lurked her facebook the night of  just that i did a week ago when i saw the other stuff and then she told me she hung out with him that night and what happen.  all is good i guess.  thank you all for the help. I will keep you posted if anything else happens 

Ok this is a relativly long story. I apologize now for any grammar or spelling mistakes, I am in a panic. 

About a week ago I log onto Facebook on my Gaming/Video Editing computer (a computer i don't normally use facebook or anything for that matter) and i see a new message from a guy with some flirting going on. I quickly realize its not my facebook but my girlfirned left her facebook logged in. I begin to read more since the conversation is somewhat dirty and explicit. There is mention of hanging out (ok fine whatever, they have hung out so it appears but it was kept a secret from me) The person she speaks to almost constantly asks her for blowjobs in a joking way. But it seems like more than joking since the talks often go into detail about blowjobs and other sexual acts.  The guy is weird and constatnly asks her for one (weather it be joking or not, I dont know)


(sorry for the wall)

Anyway flash forward to right now, (well an hour ago) my grilfriend got off work at 9:45 said she was on the bus, didnt hear back from her till about 1030 ( i was worried and sent a few texts asking if she got home ok) it is unlike her to go more than like 5 minutes without responding. she quicky sends like 5 messages in a row saying ""yeah sorry i was getting a snack, washed up now im going to go to bed good night!"" very strange. So i go on my other PC and check her facebook ( i feel horrible for doing this, i feel like i am envading her privacy) (i dont do it regularly this is probably the third time since the accident) And i see that he is giving her directions to his house and she is crrently walking there and plans for a massage and a movie)  so as of right now  she is ""sleeping"" and i am here panicing/freaking out  what the fuck do i do?  I know i have to break up wtih her, but how? when? Do i tell her i invaded her privacy?

edit:  I know lots of relationships the couples hang out with the oposit sex alone, but in ours it is un heard of and if the tables were turned i would be fucked. Altohught i would never do it.

Edit2: ok so i checked her messages again just now and she is home. she sent him a message saying ""im sorry"" one hour ago. he responded with ""haha its ok"" her: "" i feel so dumb!"" him: ""lmfaoooo"" her: ""dont even make fun. hey nice tweet a hole. just gunna ignore me now? lol"" 

So it looks like maybe she felt guilty and left? maybe during a sexual act? Idk. i could just be paranoid. 

Edit3: going to try and sleep or read or something. Have to work tomorrow. still unsure on how i am going to approach this.  What i do know for sure is this relationship is over.  Thank you for the help. More advice is welcome and I will update you as more happens.

We were talking on Facebook chat and he literally said this out of nowhere. There was no conversation leading up to it. I don't know what to think right now. I'm 5'4 and weigh 160 pounds. I'm not a stick thin girl but I'm pretty confident in myself. Until now that is. I feel like I'm over-reacting but I also feel like this is harsh and I can't stop crying. 

I'll preface this by saying I understand what it's like to want your partner to lose weight. My last relationship was like that, though I never said ANYTHING like this to him. Ever. I was always supportive and I just asked if he'd like to go to the gym with me occasionally. But never anything like this. I don't like how he's putting my weight and his happiness on the same level. 

I don't know what to think right now. My only response to this was, ""Wow."" and I logged off because I can't even deal.

""Here's the thing. When i first talking with you, i instantly like a lot of qualities you had. I was into it and i still enjoy those qualities. You are great and i love you and your personality. It's just that i wish you were a little skinnier. I'm pretty sure the thing that is holding me back the most, which is fucking ridiculous, is you being a little heavier. Maybe it is a shallow thought, but that's just how i feel. I love you as a person and always will. I just wish you were smaller. I think that may have been a problem in previous encoutners when you think i'm trying to hide you or w/e. I didn't hide you consiously. I've just always been interested in smaller, skinnier girls. I think i tried to hint at it before, but dunno if you got it. I've also been trying to be healthier for myself and for you. So the bottom line is, I love you a lot for reasons other than your appearance. If you were a little skinnier i would probably be the happiest person ever. I wouldn't have anything in the way and you would be my dream girl. Remember when i said dream girl? I mean it if you were skinnier. I hope you don't take this the wrong way because you're awesome.

however. i have noticed for the past few weeks that he has been looking at porn-- pictures and videos-- while he's laying right next to me in bed. we've talked about porn before, and i mentioned the reasons it made me uncomfortable but assured him that i didn't want to prohibit him from watching or anything. i've even suggested we watch porn together, but he turns down the offer every time, claiming that the one time we did watch it together it didn't turn him on at all. 

honestly, it just strikes me as odd that he is compelled to sit there and look at porn (touching himself, too) while i'm RIGHT THERE and seldom would turn down sex/a hand job/a blow job, if ever. asking him to stop wouldn't really change how i feel about it, but i guess i would like him to stop on some level. has anyone else dealt with this? or could anyone explain this to me? i'd rather just break things off if this indicates that he's uninterested or something... and i know that porn and sex are two different realms of the male mind. but i feel like sloppy seconds to porn sometimes? help!

Did I overreact?",throwitallawayornot,90,26,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/mf6qw/accidentally_read_gfs_diary_revealed_fantasies/,"Been with this girl for around 2 years. In love with her. My best friend, who I've known since I was maybe 15 (27 now) lives in NY and we visit back and forth pretty regularly. He came to visit me last week or so, everything seemed kosher. This morning, I noticed my GF's diary, which she has never written in had fallen off the shelf. I noticed there was a lot of writing in it which was odd since she has had it and not touched it for months. Here is where things get interesting. 


It read:


""I had a dream about kissing XXXX. It was a cute passionate kiss. And I can't stop thinking about it. I know eventually I will. Dreams always seem to effect me weird. Whenever I have a dream about throwitallawayornot cheating or something I am usually mad at him for a couple of days even if he didn't do anything. 


Anyways, XXXX is always showing he has a little something for me. It bothers everyone but no one will say anything. He has tried to kiss me, he is always touching me and it has been weird. But this trip, it was almost like I was looking for it, wanting it. I would walk past him and touch his shoulder. Or hand him something and hold onto his hand an extra second. Like I was egging him on. Daring him to do something about it. What the fuck.


The entire time I was taking this attention and almost using it against throwitallawayornot. Like throwitallawayornot isn't soft like that with me. He isn't cute. He isn't romantic. And that's not what I was seeing when  I was seeing xxxx. The other night I was wanting throwitallawayornot to leave the room so I could lock eyes with him more. 


And I know he wants it too. That's what is hard as well because I know I am messing with his head when I am doing these things to him. I am only making things more difficult for their relationship, our relationship and my relationship with throwitallawayornot. It is also trying on my relationship with (xxxx's sister) because she gets upset that I am even talking to him at all besides when he is visiting. I have pretty much learned not to tell her anything anymore about it. 


He and I were talking online about things and I mentioned one thing about throwitallawayornot and he flips and stops talking to me. That is weird.


The truth is that if I wasn't completely, totally, utterly in love with throwitallawayornot, I would probably be interested in him. He is smart, he has a cool job, his family is great, I love his sense of style and he has a huge birthmark that actually kind of turns me on. So overall, he is an amazing guy, he deserves a rad chick that can care about him as much as he will care about her. but that is not me. throwitallawayornot is the best thing that has happened to me in a long time and I am not willing to let that go. He really is my other half. 


At other times I almost fantasize about just escaping burlington and going to NY on a whim, cheesy movie type escaping where I go there in the pouring rain, get to his door soaking wet, crying because I can't believe I actually did it. I knock on the door and he opens it and takes me in his arms. We have that perfect kiss again... and again... and again... I lock him into his room and have him to myself for hours. He hasn't been with that many people so I know I would be taking control and that turns me on just thinking about it. 


But then its all over and I know I would always end up back with throwitallawayornot. He is the love of my life.""


So there you have it. After talking to her, she just tried to convince me that the entire thing was just writing down a series of her dreams that she had over the few days he was here last week and none of it had any bearing on reality. I called total bullshit and kicked her out of the house (we lived together). Did I overreact?

**TLDR**

Gf of 2 years has major ladyboner for my best friend of 10+ years, talks about making moves on him in her diary, i I dump her.

 Hoping someone will wade through the wall of text and give some advice, feeling pretty shredded right now.

Sounds like I may have overreacted. Damn you reddit, you always know the right things to say. I think I'll cool off for a few days and then take her to dinner and see if we can sort things out.

My problem is that I can't get friends. The ones I have simply make zero effort to be with me, and actually seem to avoid my efforts to be with them. I don't have a solid group of friends and my social life is near to zero, no matter how hard I try it not to be.

This situation has been going on for a few months, which means that I'm feeling more and more lonely. That leads to a problem whose cause and consequence are the same, which kinda means I'm in a vicious circle. Loneliness leads to depression, which leads to more loneliness. This also leads to general bad mood, difficulty concentrating and studying.

I'm not bad looking and can have hilarious conversations when I'm feeling good. I don't think I've ever been denied a first date. After that, I think, my insecurity (which I've had a lot of since I was a little kid) and awkwardness kick in and people drift away.

This, in the last few weeks, has lead me to start feeling angry at my situation. I feel myself becoming bitter and revolted because nothing I do is working, and my therapist recently said that I'm feeling ""angry at the human condition"", because I feel friends should help each other, not avoid one who feels down.

I also have almost no one to talk to. The one I usually vented with is a person in my family who has a little child and, understandably, has the good will but little time.

Since people don't want to do stuff with me, I'm starting to make plans on my own. I've never been much of an independent person on that behalf, but that raises another problem: there isn't much I want to do or see. I have joined a volunteer program and am currently awaiting a call from them.

So, how do I turn this situation around? I see a lot of the advice is to ""work on myself"", but exactly does one do that?",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_lwbio,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/lwbio/how_do_you_tackle_forever_aloneness/,

Anyways, I'm living at home for a bit after graduating from university.  Early 20s, female.

I always get a disapproving vibe from my mom, like she doesn't really like me.  When I was younger (like 11-13) she told me I was ""stealing her husband away from her.""  Like my Dad was taking my side on a lot of things, or something.  Great, now I don't get any sort of emotional relationship with either parent.

We've never been close, and I think she's just jealous of me.  Thing have been going quite well for me lately.  I did well in school, the after school world has been great.  She is retired and stays at home.  A lot of the things she say to me seem designed to point out what she thinks is less than perfect about me.  Like pointing out that I don't have close friends here (I just moved and am busy).

She gets jealous when I have close chats with my sister.  Or when I ""steal the spotlight from her"" for a bit at the dinner table.  It just doesn't make any sense, because I'm not really doing anything specific.  Her own insecurity is making her look for things to feel bad about, and then take her suffering out on me by being passive aggressive.

Maybe I'm too old to be whining about this, but I haven't lived in the same country as them for 6 years, so I haven't had to deal with this for a long time.

I don't want to bring it up to her, because we aren't really a family that talks about this type of thing.  Does anyone have any advice or support to offer?

Obviously I can't do the whole situation justice here in a reddit post, but as a result of a blowup recently, I've been re-evaluating my relationship and coming to some conclusions that are pretty unsettling.

I'm realising how much I've let her frame all our relationship issues as I'm the one at fault. So I then need to prove myself to her. And I've let myself walk on eggshells in the face of her formidable wrath. It's as though her reality is all that counts and I need to mould myself to her perceptions.

Now we are due for a joint counselling session on Friday. But right now, I can't see a way forward. It scares me to say it, but I don't really like her as a person. There's aspects of her personality that are controlling, judging and demanding. She's prone to wild mood swings and temper tantrums and I don't know if I have it in me right now to try and work it all out.

**UPDATE**: Thanks for all the amazing comments - it's very supportive to realise that there are others out who have gone through similar crises and come out of it one way or another.

So right now I'll maintain the holding pattern until Friday's session. It's just so frustrating and bamboozling dealing with the total gulf between our realities right now.

There, I worked with a guy who I developed a huge crush on. Problem was that every other chick at my work had a thing for him, too: he was funny, nice, super hot, worked out, dressed nicely, and had his life together. I was 19 and he was 24 at the time. 

I had super low self-esteem so I figured with all of the other girls fawning over him he'd never be interested in me. Despite this, we spent enough time around one another through work that we got to know each other pretty well and eventually became friends. I still had the crush for a long time; then he eventually moved in with me as my roommate. The day he moved in I forced myself to put my feelings for him out of my mind. My logic was that he had no trouble talking to / getting girls, so if he was interested in me, he would've let me know by then. 

We lived together for over a year and he was the best roommate I ever had. I still felt as though I'd been firmly placed in ""the friend zone"", though, since he talked to me like ""one of the guys"". 

I moved out to live in another state, we would keep in touch via e-mail or MSN and talk maybe once or twice a year, but generally lost touch. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago: I hadn't heard from him in two or three years, and he sends me a message out of the blue saying he was thinking about me. He confessed that he always had a thing for me, but he never tried anything because he thought I was ""out of his league"" and had ""friend zoned"" him. 

/facepalm

We're now talking about seeing each other sometime soon (we live about two hours apart) and seeing if the old feelings are still there. 

TL;DR: I never got together with an awesome guy because I thought he was out of my league, he never approached me because he thought I was out of his league. Took almost 10 years to realize that was the only thing that kept us apart.

Edit: I suppose I should've posted this in r/Cynicism instead? Whether or not this pans out into a relationship IS NOT the point. The point is that due to insecurity we both hesitated on something that we wanted. Which could have turned out great, or could have sucked. The point is that we never knew because we were too afraid to give it a shot. 

We may not ever get together. We may get together and find out there's no chemistry after all. We might get together once and it might be a one night stand, or a FWB thing, or we might live happily ever after -- but the point of the story remains the same: if you like someone, suck it up and let them know, because not knowing is worse than being told no.

(I realize I still have issues from the divorce and probably am not ready to date much right now, but I feel these are unrelated to this particular situation). 

We started chatting on okcupid, seemed to click, and exchanged phone numbers to talk before actually meeting. The first few days and phone conversations were great, we really clicked. The next few days got really weird and clingy really fast, I felt like red flags were popping up everywhere. He started sending me several txts a day. After two days I had to tell him to stop because I'd hit my limit (this was true, but at the middle of the month I'd normally never even gotten close.) They were also starting to sound weird for someone who's never met me yet. things like:
""what are you doing now"" (this is weird because I'd get a couple of these a day)
""I was just wondering, do you like to cuddle"" (out of the blue, no flirty text going on beforehand. No flirty texing ever for the record.
He was calling me ""baby"" all the time, again, not even a 1st date yet.
Begging me for a pic saturday night to show his friends, because he's quote ""bragging"" about me to them.

Once I asked him to refrain from texting the calls came in, all the time. On Sunday he called me four times and they were all for nothing. The last call was at midnight (which I didn't answer, I guess I thought if I didn't give him attention he'd back off a little.) He apparently just wanted to tell me he was going to bed, and wanted to say good night?!

The phone conversations also started having weird sprinklings of conversation, once the initial once the initial small talk of tv shows and hobbies was done. Making such a point every conversation several times a conversation to tell me he is such a good cook, he cooks so good, here's why he cooks so great...you should let me cook for you. Come over right now, I'll cook you dinner. (I know what he's doing, its not subtle at all, honestly, once would be fine but we had gone through these lines multiple times every time he spoke.) He tried these hooks with lots of subjects too, like how he sucks at rock band, and how he should come over to my place so I could teach him. (You don't try to invite yourself over to someones place, especially if you've never met, that's just creepy.) It also started to freak me out how he started gushing about how cool and pretty I was when we never even met. Now it's flattering but to bring it up as often as he did was just weird. And not just ""hey you're a cool girl..."" It was how I'm the coolest, never met a girl like me before, no girl is as cool as me, he's telling all his friends how cool I am, ""he's quote ""totally bragging about me"". I literally mean he said all of those things at once, no breaks, practically every time I picked up the phone. Many other weird things too, I had complained about my apartment, and his response was that I could always move into his townhouse. Fixating on the fact that I didn't have a Halloween costume, even though I told him I had no plans and  was happy to stay home. He then started making stupid suggestions like a hot cop or a french maid.

Sorry for all the text here's my real problem, after 2 nice days and 4 days of creepy nonsense and red flags I decided to call off the 1st date we had set up. I know its lame but I sent a text, basically saying that I just wasn't ready to date, and how I need a very long time for myself. This is actually pretty true, but I just didn't have to heart to tell him he was so creepy and smothering that I was completely off put now.  He sent me a text asking if everything is ok, to which I pretty much reiterated how yes, I'm fine but I need space and time to myself and I decided it wasn't right to date.

Now, I hadn't had contact for a few days and thought I was free of him, but he's started texting me again, first it was one word: ""ok???!"". I ignored it because I figured I explained myself last week and didn't want to ""reward"" him with attention as he seems crazily clingy. Yesterday I got a photo of him texted to me with no message. This morning I got a ""hello, I never heard back from u, are you ok"", followed by, of all things a pic of a jack-o-lantern of a woman being doubly penetrated by two men and hour later. Help me reddit what do I do to just get him off me?!

tldr: Started talking to a guy on okcupid over the phone, he started getting insanely clingy and weirder as the days went by so I canceled our first date planned. I thought I made my self clear that I wasn't going to do any dating but he keeps texing me now. Oh yes and an obscene pumpkin, which might be somewhat funny of I wasn't fearful of him finding me and wearing my skin at this point. (extreme sarcasm but I'm at my wits end.)

After he inevitably tells me what the surprise is he will build it up and then in the moment of truth completely do about a third of what he said he'd do. Here's a couple of examples:

1) For our first year anniversary he tells me that he's going to cook me a fancy meal set to a candle lit dinner after which we will take a romantic walk underneath the stars. Anticipating this, I buy him a fairly nice and thoughtful gift. Here's what I got: a one course meal that had the complexity of Kraft macaroni and cheese set to a dirty table with glaring overhead lighting and no candles (he ""forgot""). In lieu of a romantic walk under the stars we went to a movie he wanted to see and I paid for my own ticket. I didn't say anything or start a fight but I definitely didn't stay over that night.

2) Perhaps sensing my disappointment at his ill-fated anniversary dinner plans, he told me how he wanted to surprise me with a nice, thoughtful gift for Christmas. Again, in anticipation, I went out an bought him a somewhat expensive gift costing around $100 (expensive for my meager salary, anyway). His gift? A $15 dollar purse that he bought from Walmart. On Christmas eve. With me in store with him, so he tried to hide it underneath the other things we were buying. 

If you can't envision my disappointment, guys, envision this: Your girlfriend tells you she is going to give you the sexual experience of your life. She's arranged a threesome with her hot best friend and they are both willing to try that one thing that you've always wanted to do. On the night of the big event, she tells you she totally meant to call her friend but forgot and gives you a half-hearted handjob during which she is fully clothed and then falls asleep on the couch.

He has good intentions which is nice and all but shit, when someone tells me I'm going to get something awesome and gives me something shitty I can't help but be let down. It's not even that fancy gifts or nice dinners really matter to me, it's that he doesn't put the fucking effort in. It wouldn't even be so bad if he didn't build it up all the time. He offers similar nice gestures but 99% of the time doesn't go through with them. He seems hurt when he tells me all the romantic stuff he wants to do with me and I just brush it off with a bored ""that's real nice honey"". What else am I supposed to do? I don't get excited because I know I will be let down again.

Am I being unreasonable here? If so, how do I get over it? If not, how do I bring this up to him? I know he feels bad about letting me down.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_cljmx,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cljmx/am_i_being_immature_for_being_so_disappointed_or/,
1271038493.0,64,self.relationship_advice,bpkpv,How do I deal with my very unhygienic boyfriend?,dirtybf,86,22,168,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bpkpv/how_do_i_deal_with_my_very_unhygienic_boyfriend/,"I've been seeing my boyfriend now for 6 months are so. Things are okay between us, but I feel like a significant wedge is driving me away from him as a result of his frighteningly bad hygiene. Granted, this isn't ""help my boyfriend shits in socks and keeps jars of old semen under his bed"", but if this doesn't stop who knows where he will be in a few years.

In point form:

- He goes several days (I've seen him go upwards to 4) without showering or changing clothes. This wouldn't be so bad if he stayed at home in his cave, but he continues going out (school, work, out with friends or with me, etc) without making the slightest effort to clean up. Aggravating this is the fact that I've seen him brag about this to his friends. No one, nowhere, should be proud of the fact that they haven't showered in a week.

- He never brushes his teeth voluntarily, and when he does (maybe once a week or so), he does a piss-poor job and it doesn't actually make any difference to alleviate the rotten-eggs breath. 

- He has a bad eating disorder, and his unhealthy eating which seems to be affecting his sweat. His diet consists mostly of fried foods, and he seems to just sweat out the smell of used grease that makes me gag. I also believe this may be affecting the breath issue, as he does not eat for very long periods of time, and it seems like the lack of saliva production only aggravates the festering in his mouth.

- As a result of him not showering for long periods of time, he is particularly rank below the belt. This, needless to say, has killed what little remained of our sex life.

- He is someone who is in the camp of ""I don't use deodorant because I don't want to corrupt my cells with the chemicals"", which I wouldn't necessarily mind if (like some others who I know who have that view) he would offset it by staying clean. But as I have discussed, he does not. You can just imagine the end result.

Granted I suppose the latter could be worse, like if he tried to cover himself up with Axe like an 8th grader after gym class.

By no means am I a germophobe or a clean freak, but I do take hygiene seriously enough - not only out of respect for those around me, but for myself as well. While I feel conflicted for trying to force this mentality onto him, I don't think I'm too out of place in expecting a level of hygiene that would let me get close to him without gagging. 

It's gotten to the point where I can't kiss him anymore on most days, and after he leaves my place I have to spray febreeze on everything and open all the windows. He sees me becoming increasingly distant as his habits get worse and worse, but I can't help it because being near him in this state is causing actual disgust and revulsion.

I've tried being subtle about it (""I'm done in the shower, it's all yours""), I've tried being sexy about it (""let's shower together ;) ;)"" followed by sensual body cleaning), I've tried being a bit more overt (""I put out some towels and your toothbrush so you can get ready for bed""), but nothing's worked. 

Should I just tell him bluntly ""hey you always smell and taste disgusting. Take a shower and learn to brush your teeth more than once a week"". I suppose I'm too shy to say such a thing as I don't want to make him mad.

So, reddit, how do I deal with my very unhygienic boyfriend?

**edit:** Neither he nor I are fat and/or ugly. Apart from his hygiene issues, he is very handsome and fit. I like to think that I'm quite attractive as well - though I recognize that I have my own self-esteem issues to work with here.

It's a small wedding and no +1s were given outside of immediate family members. I accepted the invitation, even though I won't really know anyone there. My boyfriend made numerous comments along the lines of ""if I were invited to a wedding without you, I wouldn't go"" etc. But I think that's sort of ridiculous.

I originally told him I had no intention of staying over and would just leave the wedding reception early and drive the 2.5 hours home. But since then I've realized that 1) it's rude to leave early and 2) it's a really long drive to make late at night. So I booked a hotel room..... without his knowledge.

We broke up just after Thanksgiving, but I stayed really close with his sister. In January, she committed suicide (I was with her when it happened), so he and I got back in contact. In February, he suggested being in a full-fledged, monogamous relationship, and we've been together since then.

**The Problem:** For starters, we have very mis-matched sex drives; he's satisfied with our current rate of about once/week, whereas I would prefer multiple times per day. When we do have sex, he's more into the ""making love"" kind, with lots of eye and skin contact. I prefer it on the hard and rough side.

Outside of sex, though, he's almost never affectionate with me. He doesn't like kissing, says it smudges up his glasses. He says holding hands just isn't comfortable. Cuddling basically consists of me cuddling with him and him acting like I'm not there.  The other night, we were out at a restaurant, and I put my hand on his knee and he freaked; he said everyone could tell what I was doing (I later talked to the friends that were there about it, and they had no idea what I was talking about) and that it was inappropriate.

We talked about it last night, and he said I was being controlled by my ""lustful desires"" (umm, what) and that it was probably from my ""secular upbringing."" I told him that I was not going to be made to feel guilty for being nonsexually affectionate, and he didn't respond to that.

Three kids (one newborn).  Both of us are 30 but we have a dead bedroom (and not because of the newborn, it has been dead for years).  Single income, I work, she stays home and watches the kids.

My wife and I aren't happy.  We've both said we feel like two adults just babysitting three children instead of being the happy couple we used to be.  A few years back my job really picked up and I started to work more and more.  I would be at the office for upwards of 70 hours a week.  It started to strain on her.  I would come home tired from work and not wanting to do anything.  We talked for a very long time and I turned a corner.  I came home on time, I spent more time with her and the kids, I started buying her little things like flowers and cookies like I did when we were dating.  I even went to a counselor on my own for self help.  Things were looking really better but I noticed something.  She had thought the reason I didn't come on time was because I liked my job better then her.  I realized that I didn't like coming home because I felt like she was not pulling her weight in the relationship.  I help around the house, cooking, cleaning, dishes, laundry, beds, don't get me wrong.  And yes, she is staying home to take care of and raise my children but I would always get the sense that when I walked in the door, it was time for her to go out and me to do everything.  I would be gone for 8 hours and the house would be exactly like it was when I left.  I'm not talking spotless.  I'm talking about food that was spilled on the floor.  Garbage overflowing.  Kids still dirty from being outside.  Wrappers from everything all over.  She had not gone out with the kids, there was not something that came up.  She either slept in or just watched TV while the kids went outside and left everything as it was.  Everytime I approached her about it she yelled at how she is not my maid.  I asked her the other day if she could do the laundry that was sitting in a pile in our bedroom.  I learned later that day she said I broke her heart.  Today I snapped.  I came home for lunch, bringing something for her that she asked me to get, and there she was.  The entire time I was home for lunch, she was in the bedroom laying down.  She didn't get up to say hi, she didn't say anything.  I made lunch for the kids, and went back to work.  We got into a fight before I left.  I said that she is right she is not my maid, but she is a homemaker and I need her to help around the house.  I can't do everything.  I need us to work together on this relationship and that if she was the one working and paying the bills, I would be taking care of the house and kids.  She took everything I said as a ""I'm the king of the castle, I wear the wife beater and watch tv while she does everything else"" attitude and we both stopped talking.

Two big details play into this.  

First, we just moved.  I got a new job that netted me a 50% raise for less than half of the work/responsibility I had before.  I can work from home, I can take as much vacation as I like, and we actually got a house very close to my work (so things like coming home for lunch are doable).  I rarely work more than 40 hours a week but when I do I at least get overtime (I didn't in my last job  where I worked 70 hours a week).  Unfortunately, it was in another state.  I know this is a **huge** impact on the stress in our lives but all these problems existed before our move.

Second is our dead bedroom.  Things changed after our first child.  She lost interest.  Even the thought about having sex seemed to be a turn off.  In a heated debate about this topic two years ago she even said she only had sex with me the year before just to get pregnant.  We've made love twice this year and only 4 times in the last two months.  I know we're not rabbits anymore but we're only 30.  To go five months without being able to make love to my wife is hard.  And sadly, I think the only reason she went through during our second time this year was because of our 8th anniversary.  She does not see how this is hurting me and does not think anything needs to be done.  ""I'd be perfectly content with never having sex again in my life"" she says.

Am I doing something wrong?  I decided to reach out here because we both agreed to see a marriage counselor and kind of hit our final straws.  Plus, she let me know that she has been reaching out to her ""mommy"" networks for advice so fair is fair.  

We love each other very much, we're just not happy at the moment.  Neither of us wants to end it and we both love all three of our children.  We just want to make a change so they are not impacted by all of this.  

**tl;dr - I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.  She feels like I think she is my maid.  We are not happy, kids are noticing.**


**UPDATE:**  Thank you everyone for your comments.  It has really motivated me to get help instead of spiraling out of control.  Question.  My wife has shown me the posts she made on her mommy forums.  Does anything think showing her this and the responses would be destructive or helpful?

I said that it might be a little awkward for Eva, since she might feel like a third wheel. In all honesty, it is also because I would simply like to have dinner with Eva alone, just so we can converse as natually and openly as we always have.

We did most things independently, but would hang out together once or twice a week. And those times were, and still are, amazing.

After feeling increasing unhappiness over the last few months, I have realised that I don't want to be single yet together anymore. I want our lives to mesh more. I want him to be proud of me and include me in his life and decisions. I want to be his first and main priority. The problem is, he completely loves me, and thinks we are in the perfect relationship. I have brought it up tentatively, but retreated quickly when he got offended and upset when I suggested he isn't making as much effort as I would like. See, he considers me a main priority, but only along with his family, friends, and job. These aren't terrible things to have as priorities, but without sounding selfish, I don't want to be allocated time based on my equal priority standing, I want to be the most important thing to him.

I have reached a point where I think about breaking up with him everyday, because I am that unhappy about the imbalance. I don't know what to do because I fear talking about it is going to be pointless. I will come across and needy and selfish, and in the end I will never be able to make someone think I am more important than they have already deemed me.

Is it worth sticking with? After almost 2 years, is there any potential growth left in his feelings for me, so that we can become an actual couple?

Long time Redditor, first time positing. 

I have been with my GF for over 4 years and we have grown to have a very nice life together. At first she was the one that loved and poured more into the relationship but then I slowly came around and did the same. Last year in October I felt things slipping between us. I cant explain the feeling but I just knew in my gut something was up. Sure enough she was seeing a guy from her work behind my back. She claims nothing happened but I do not believe that for a second. To make a long story short she said she cut it off and let him know that they can only be friends as she wants a life with me (something that I truly believe). She claims that he has major problems in his life and that she is just being a good friend. FYI this is the kind of person that she is so I had no reason to disbelieve. I also am not a jealous person and can deal with her having male friends etc. as 90% of my friends are attractive females.  Anyway I told her I could forgive and live with that on one condition. She was not to be with him alone in his house or hers.... period.

Well I went out with some friends on Friday night and on my way home at 3:30 am decided to stop by her place which is normal for us. I get into the building and look in the parking lot to see a strange car parked in her space. I call her phone, no answer, knock on the door no answer but I can hear movement and the TV on inside. She then calls security and tells them that she doesn't want to see me. I eventually get security to knock on her door on the pretense of giving her something I left with them.  As she opened the door I rushed in and find the same guy in her house and go into a blind rage. {EDIT: I'll leave out the details of the 10 mins that followed but it was not good} 

We have talked for the last 2 days about what happened. She insists that nothing was going on. She tells me that I was out of my mind, that they were just hanging out talking, having a drink &amp; watching the rerun of the HEAT game. She sys she loves me and that she wants a life with me. She says I am going crazy (maybe I am) and that I don't trust in her love for me. I don't know what to believe or what to do.  Yesterday was a lot of arguing and blame towards each other. Today I broke down and apologized for acting like a monster because my violent reaction (even if I caught them in bed together) was wrong &amp; is not part of my character. 
 
I haven't slept more than an hour since Friday night. I am horrified at my own actions (I am usually a calm &amp; rational person). I am angry that she lied to me, that she found it necessary to hide this supposed friendship with this guy from me again, I am regretful, I am depressed, confused..broken.

For instance, recently I went to pick my wife up from work, and after she came outside she started a conversation with one of her co-worker friends. I was tired, my feet hurt, I had gone out of my way to pick her up, and their conversation was of the ""What's up?"", ""Not much, you?"" variety. She was clearly enjoying taking a minute after work to socialize, which I did not want to spoil, but in the end, it soured my mood significantly that she was too distracted to notice that I was just standing there waiting, and there wasn't anything I could think to say that would get us on the road without making me seem like a selfish grump.

So, how do you avoid being the bad guy, but get out of those unpleasant situations?

Edit: As dumb as I am, I'm not so dumb as to have overlooked saying, ""Hey, sorry, I'm tired, I'm going to sit in the car,"" and doing so. Even if my wife would understand, that's not the way I'd want to treat one of her friends.

More Editing: As much as I like taking a moment to savor a good sit, I apparently failed to emphasize that it's the waiting that I would like to avoid, not simply the standing. To me, telling someone you're going to sit in the car is a passive-aggressive way of telling someone you're tired of waiting.

He knows his woman well though because he confessed he'd actually been joking with his friends recently that if he didn't ask me soon he knew I would pop the question myself.  :-)

Used to be in pretty bad shape, and somewhat recently lost a lot of weight, put on some muscle, and otherwise cleaned myself up.

I was at a bar last night with some of my friends, when a cute girl sits down at a table next to us alone. After noticing that she's still alone for a few minutes and has glanced over at me, I start up a conversation with her and she joins our group.

Fast forward, she ends up talking to me for quite a while (an hour or two). I think she's pretty cute, and we seem to hit it off, even though I can actually only understand 25% of what she's saying since it's so loud. At this point it's getting pretty late and some of my friends are leaving, so I figure I'll head out too and get her number, which she happily gives to me (I call it in front of her so she has mine so I know it's real).

About 10 minutes after I left, the girl calls me and asks where I went off to! She seemed disappointed when I told her I was going home, said she was hoping to do something that night. I asked if she was free tomorrow or anytime next week, and she said she was never free... then basically told me to have a good night and hung up.

Do I even bother calling this girl again? It seems like all she was looking for was a hookup, but that wasn't the feeling I got off her when I was talking to her before. I'm also working on not beating myself up for turning down such an easy booty call. I was pretty exhausted from a long day when she called me and not feeling particularly horny at all.

I'm sure most guys would jump at the chance...but I'm not particularly interested. We've been together for close to a year now and we are both very committed to each other. She is my first sexual partner though she has had more partners than me and is more experienced. It would be her first threesome as well.

She brought it up the other night and it really rubbed me the wrong way. I really love her... I honestly want nobody else. I have no desires to be with any other women. I am 100% content. 

With her asking, it just made me feel like she wants to be intimate with another person...which bothers me a bit. I asked her about this and she stated that wasn't true, that I was the only person for her. I believe her to no end, but I'm still a bit uneasy.

Does anyone have any advice for me? I guess I'm just bothered by the fact that I would never consider it and she has been thinking about it.

I'm also a bit scared that this will change the dynamic of our relationship, I really love what we have right now.

Sorry for the ramble, I'm just a bit broken up.

Thanks reddit, any advice and support would mean the world to me.

We spoke today and she is very understanding. We had a good chat and by the end of it we both ended up feeling very good.

I was really flirting with her, and I think she was even flirting back with me during the course of the whole ordeal.

As you can probably guess I am an idiot and did not take the majority of the advice given to me by the all knowing reddit.

It's been a little over a month since since the last post and things between me and this girl had been moving exceptionally fast between me and her.  Spent loads of time together, talked all the time, just generally a great relationship.  I even took two weeks off for vacation and spent the whole time with her.  We went on a trip out of town with a few of my friends and had a great time.  

Well, as soon as I went back to work I found out that her ex actually decided to come see his kid.  Not really a big deal but I could just feel something was up but I was just going to let things play out.  

The next day after that I was on my way home to pick her up so we could go out and then meet some friends for a few drinks later.  Everything was going well as usual until the drive home.  We started talking and I could sense that something was wrong.  I ended up having to force her to tell me that she slept with her ex earlier that day.  Needless to say that turned into a shouting match that last for nearly two hours in the parking lot of the apartment complex.  During which I got punched in the face by her for being upset (she was drunk which is still no excuse but seems slightly relevant).  

We finally decided to go inside the apartment to calm down and get out of the parking lot before we got the cops called.  Where upon entering the apartment I find her ex sleeping in our bed.  Which at this point I just lost it and walked out the door and called a friend to come and pick me up.  

The next day when I finally talked to her she didn't really even remember any of it happeneing because she was too inebriated and I had to spell everything out for her.  She apologized to which I just told her she could fuck off.  To top everything off I found out since I left my car there at the complex she decided to key the everloving shit out of it sometime that night.  Didn't remember that either.  Needless to say I had to move all my shit out of her place since I'd pretty much moved in there at the end of my lease which made things even more uncomfortable.

So Reddit, I just thought I would give ya'll an update and a chance to reinforce the fact that I am an idiot and now give you the chance to tell me you told me so.

Ok folks so today Tony sent me a FB chat pointing out that a bunch of our friends just got evicted and i could find one of them to be my roommate. Conversation went like this.

**T:** you see all the people that need new homes...fun people man, any chance you would wanna live with them?

**R:** Do what?
 
**T:** brair and all them just got evicted
they have to be out in 30 days

**R:** Dude I am chill where I'm at and it's not a good time financially for me to move. As my friend you should respect and understand that
 
**T:** you could find a cheaper spot

**R:** But it's not a good time for me financially. Burning man is about to smoke check me and I'm going to need time to recover from that.
 
**T:** you will have yer $1000 deposit to you the day you move out
or maybe even before
you can have $$$, move in with people that are more on your schedule, and everyone walks away on good terms

**R:** If you guys need a new moving situation so bad you should start looking for a new place I don't know what else to tell you. For me this is not a good time and as my friend you should be understanding and respect that. I think it's really really lame that you aren't considering my situation at all in this. I have always done everything I can to be a homie to you. I sent you 70 dollars worth of stuff in jail, I drove to yuma by myself to visit you, I took the more expensive room so we could have a dope place. As soon as you are in a good spot and I need something all that appears to go out the window. I'm sorry dude but I don't feel like I'm in the wrong for saying I can't do it by October. Sorry.
And I would never want to move in with people who just got evicted

**T:** it has nothing to do with any of that
 
**R:** Then what am I missing what is so urgent?
 
**T:** it has to do 100% with what kind of roommate you are
the location is great fer white gurl and i...as an adult you should respect that...we use the gym, go for walks every day, use spourts
you do nothing with the location, all it is is a cheap room
what is your situation? exactly?
 
**R:** I also love me place that has nothing to do that.
 
**T:** how about you take the $1000 room again, and we will move back into the smaller room
ya know, the ways things were
 
**R:** Don't be shitty.
 
**T:** why do you love it? you never leave your room
i'm not begin shitty, the original deal was you in the large room
 
**R:** It doesn't matter how I use my living space wtf are you talking about

**T:** you have no reason to want to stay there
you use none of the amenities in the area
 
**R:** Besides that I love the location. You aren't going to talk me out of loving my apartment.
 
**T:** you stay in yer room all the time and play online
what do you love about it?
the view out of your window?

**R:** That's a stupid way to go about this conversation Anthony
 
**T:** you are being difficult for no reason Rob
as your friend, i would really appreciate it if you moved out
i will help you look fer a new place
 
**R:** You are asking for me to inconvenience the hell out of myself for you and your only reason why is ""because you don't even like it."" No I do like it. I'll move out when I can. I can't afford to move October 1. It's too quick. My unemployment is out and I'm waiting on scholarship money. If you want me out that fast you can pay me my security deposit plus some extra to help me handle bills. Other than that I can't do it that soon.
Or you guys may find a new place to live October 1 if that date is so huge to you.
 
**T:** i would like you out asap, we can talk hard numbers fer moving and dates tonight

The conversation went on but nothing of note was said. So tonight when he gets home from work around 6 or 7 we are going to sit down and discuss this. I honestly don't see how i could remain living here without making it a huge deal which i don't want to do. Any advice for the conversation tonight guys? I mostly just thought i owed everyone an update after all the great advice i got the other day.

**Update 2** As per the original post my concern of him going to the people i was going to move in proved true. He already hit them up and told him they were 100% not moving and said i was a shitty roommate. WTF

My (F47) husband (M48) of 25 years has a running buddy (F35) that totally creeps me out. ""Larissa"" was one of ""Gerald's"" graduate students. She has since quit the program and is attending another university online. Gerald and Larissa started running together about a year ago and have developed a friendship that my gut feeling says is over the line. 

They Facebook and text regularly, like every day or two. She unloads on Gerald about her horrendous ex-husband, being victimized through the courts because the ex's family ""knows all the judges here"", how hard it is to be unemployed, being halfway across the country from family and single-parenting two (admittedly adorable) little girls. Nothing terribly inappropriate, just weirdly often, weirdly personal contact.

Shortly after they started running, I got an uncomfortable feeling about her. I met her. We tried (weakly) to be friends, but her presence is like aluminum foil on my molar fillings. She scares me. 

There is something a wild-eyed, impulsive and very vulnerable about this woman. She is unstable.  I'd be unstable, too if I had lived through even half of the crap she says she has dealt with during her ugly, ugly, *very* ugly divorce. She IS fragile. She really is depressed and anxious. The very best thing for her would be to maintain all of her friendships, keep adding new ones AND keep running to help with the stress.  I think she stimulates Gerald's desire to be a white night and ""save"" a damsel in distress. She actually kind of makes *me* want to take her under-wing and mother her, too. I am NOT unsympathetic to her plight. I just don't want MY husband saving her. 

This is the first time in the 27 years we have been together that I have had a gut feeling like this about someone threatening my marriage, but over the years, I have learned to trust my instincts when it comes to my home and our kids (m21, f19, m13). My intuition has warned me about dangerous situations, health issues, shenanigans they shouldn't be getting up to. I trust the gift of fear. 

It's not just ""I'm a little jealous.""  My imagination runs wild. She might think landing a guy like Gerald would be just the thing to stick it to her ex. I'm afraid to be alone in the house at night because she might show up with a shotgun. Really. She could plotting that wrecking our home would almost be justifiable because Gerald is financially stable, has successfully raised an almost-grown family AND that I have a decent job so I wouldn't be cast into destitution if she managed to take my place. I'm afraid that she might really go around the bend and do the ""if I can't have him, nobody can have him"" murder-suicide. I'm worried that she'll bring a trumped-up sexual harassment suit against her former professor and ruin his career, driving us out of our charming little college town. 

Really. That's the vibe I get. 

I have a huge urge to say, **""Bitch, you cray-cray! Stay offa my man.""**

Gerald says:

1. He really values her as a friend. Two years ago, his best friend ""Bob"" (M38-ish), moved 1,000+ mi. away and Gerald fell into a 6-8 mo. funk, mourning the loss of that friendship. Bob commiserated about the BS at work, was a drinking buddy AND ran with Gerald. It was a huge loss.

2. Finding a running partner who's at your training level and has similar aspirations **and** who will motivate you is really hard. But, Gerald has never really LOOKED for a running buddy. Both Bob and *and* Larissa just fell in his lap. So to speak.

3. Gerald is resisting me because he doesn't want to be controlled or told who he can and can't be friends with. I get that. The only defense I have is this is the only time I've asked him to kick anybody to the curb.

Not only am I afraid of what this woman may do if she snaps, I'm getting more and more angry that Gerald is betraying my loyalty. I have NO indication that they Larissa and Gerald have been physically intimate--other than the incredible intimacy you have when you're both wearing only one layer of Lycra, are sweaty, breathing hard and have been talking for an hour about how much Larissa's life sucks. 

Five months ago, I brought this whole messy situation up and *thought* I had gotten Gerald to agree to distance himself emotionally, to stop being such a close friend but continue being a running buddy. The idea was Larissa would be finishing the graduate program and would be getting  an 8-5 job so she wouldn't be available to run during the day like a college professor. I thought the problem would kind of solve itself.

This weekend, I was using Gerald's phone to navigate on a road trip and accidentally (really!) saw a series of texts from Larissa. They were just conversational, but there were 3 of them in short succession. Gerald had not replied. 

Now, Gerald says he doesn't remember agreeing to tone down the friendship to make Larissa into JUST running partner. Grrrrrr. 

I'm really angry that Gerald is putting Larissa's potential loneliness over my very real, very long-standing distress. I'm losing sleep, getting stress headaches and am turning into a nagging harpy over this. Yuck. 

So, now what? What are my best options?

No actual rabbits have been harmed in the production of this post.

We met in Oct 2009.  About 2 months into our relationship, my mom passed away, and it was during that time we first said I love you to each other.  

Fast forward to the past few years.  We started living together 2 years ago in a group house, and for the past few months we have been living together without roommates.  About a year and half ago, I cheated on her.  It wasn't physical, but I cheated emotionally.  I found a girl that was into similar things to me, and was basically the opposite of my fiancee.  I understand I have to pay the consequences for what I did, and I have not cheated since, nor do I want to.  I wasn't showing my fiancee respect, and I still apologize to her for it.  We have tried working on our relationship by having more fun together, but I never seem to have fun with her.  I've taken up reading more books with her, which is nice, but reading books together is just one thing.  I've tried including her in the things that I enjoy doing like kayaking, but she just sat on the edge of the pool.  Now, the only reason why she came is so she could mark me as hers because there are other girls that kayak with the volunteer group I belong to.  I cheated, I get why she wants to mark me.  I don't like it, but I understand.  In an attempt to do more with her, I ask her to come rock climbing with me, but she doesn't want to do that either.  She says she'd go hiking with me, but that has yet to happen.  With our wedding coming up, I'm supposed to be in charge of her workout program, but she refuses to go without me.  With everything that's on my plate, I can't always go with her, so she blames me for her getting out of shape.  I can't win.

One thing I forgot to mention is when we got engaged this past January, I was given an ultimatum; propose or get out.  I proposed, but it left a bad taste in both of our mouths.  I honestly don't know if I would have proposed because I feel like we are just too different people, and I'm not attracted to her emotionally or physically anymore.    My fiancee admits that we aren't the greatest fit for each other, but it's just easier to stay together. Her saying that gives me the feeling that I'm just another check in the box for her.  She has her college degrees, she has her career, and all she has left is the husband and kids (which she has already given me a time frame for).  I don't know if I really want to be a part of her life's list anymore.  

It really makes me think about her as a person, and I find her to be abrasive, confrontational, irrational, manipulative, and clingy.  I literally can't go to the bathroom without her asking me where I'm going.  She sometimes follows me to the bathroom and wants to sit in there with me while I go.  Strange, very strange.  I feel like I should address the irrational and manipulative attributes, though.  Just this past week I had lost my cell phone, and she was nearly in tears tell me that I ""always fuck everything up.""  Not exactly sure how I see the connection, but she does.  Now, I have since had the phone returned to me, so things are good.  I get things are stressful because I am in the middle of applying to grad school, but I'm not sure I see the connection of me always fucking everything up.  Before that was when we were moving, and I had lost my driver's license.  I was supposed to rent the truck, but without a driver's license I couldn't, so she had to come with me to make the pick up.  She had again informed me that I ""always ruin everything and I'm not going anywhere in life.""  That is an awesome thing to say to someone you are going to marry.  And I'm not exactly sure how me losing my license equates to me not going anywhere in life.  The funny thing about our relationship is she has told me several times that she doesn't think we would still be together if we didn't live together.  I agreed, however, because we probably wouldn't.  I'm not even what she wants.  She wants someone Jewish and already has a career.  I'm 29 and I'm just applying to graduate school after spending 5 and half years in the military.  Now, I do feel guilty because she has supported me through so much both financially (which I am currently paying her back for) and emotionally.  My 3 years stationed at my last duty station I was in school earning my degree, and she supported me through all the difficult times.  She was there for me, and now all I want to do is to get away from her.  

I also find her to be manipulative.  We had been in a fight and on the verge of breaking up, when she locked herself in our room and threatened to kill herself by taking a bunch of sleeping pills.  I picked the lock to the room and found her sitting in the bed with the pills next to her, so I took the pills and walked out of the room.  After the emotions died down, we talked and resolved the fight.  It was a little scary for me since I don't ever want anyone to commit suicide over me.  

I will say that there are positives to her.  She is very intelligent, has fantastic morals, and great values.  Not everything about her is terrible, and she would be able to find someone that is more suited for her, but that person isn't me.  She needs someone who will give her all the attention she needs.  She wants someone like her dad who treats his wife much differently than I treat my fiancee.  I am not a person who will do the ""oh kimmy-wimmy I wuv you so much"" stuff.

We have been engaged since late last year and we where madly in love with each other, (or so I thought) for the last few months she was acting weird. We had a very healthy relationship before that, we had sex two or three times a week, we cuddled and talked for hours, and not a day would go by without saying ""I love you"". She seemed like the perfect girl for me.
I had just turned 23 less then a week ago and she through me a surprise party at my apartment, after relatives left we called up some friends and celebrated some more. There must have been over 60 people there and the drinks were running low, so me and my buddy ""Matt"" went to the liquor store to get some more. And so this is the part where it get's interesting, after me and ""Matt"" got back it had been about 25 minuets and the party had died down quite a lot, less then half the people who where there where gone and ""Allison"" was no where to be found. After calling her phone multiple time I started to get worried, but around the third or fourth time she picked up and told me she was at a friends house.
I was a little upset, I was hoping that I would get something special tonight, but I wasn't discouraged. About an hour and a half latter I was cleaning up the place and went to bed. The next morning I woke up and walked into the kitchen to make some coffee, I looked into the family room and she was laying on the couch. I thought it was weird she never came to bed and just decided to sleep there but I decide'd to let her sleep.
While watching TV in my room I got a call from my friend ""Tom"" and he asked me if we could go out and talk. I thought something important might have come up so I got my coat on and left ""Allison"" a note saying I went to lunch with ""Tom"". I met ""Tom"" at the Denny's about five minutes away from my apartment, we sat down ordered and he told me. He told me that his friend ""Zack"" and some random guy had sex ""Allison"" at my party last night while me and ""Matt"" went to go get drinks, at this point I felt as if some buddy had kicked me in the chest and I could barely breath. ""Tom"" also told me it wasn't the first time she cheated on me.
Less then a month ago at her friends wedding she had unprotected sex with one of the grooms and might me pregnant. I went to this wedding with her, we sat there in the isle holding hands, and she told me she wanted to get married one day. ""Tom"" never lied to me before and he is a really trustworthy person, so after he ate I drove home still in shock of what I heard.
I walked inside and she was still sleeping on my couch, I was thinking about waking her up and confronting her right there about it, but then I thought to check her phone. I'm not the kind of guy who snoops around but I wanted to make sure before stuff goes down. I went into her texts and sure enough there it was, she had been sending nude pictures to people, even a video of her playing with her self on my camera, these where people I don't even know, and even in one of the texts from a few days back she said ""I'll just tell Atom the baby is his"". At this point I felt my heart break and I don't know what I should do. I have loved this girl with all my heart and she turns out to be cheating on me with multiple guys, I want to kick her out, or should I just catch her in the act. Thank you for reading this.

TL:DR My SO has been cheating on me multiple time, had sex on my birthday, and might me pregnant,

UPDATE:  Hey guys, please forgive me for my newbie Reddit behavior, thank you for everyone trying to help me out, it means a lot to me, and thank you azriel777 I think what you said was the best thing to do. Since she is a cheating bitch I got pictures of the texts, she left her phone here thinking that I wouldn't call her in the middle of something. Good thing I know her password :D So since ""Tom"" lives with his parents I invited him to come live with me, he is going to be my new room mate and also be my witness if she wants to take this to court. I called my landlord and he's getting someone to change the locks on Friday, I'll have more updates for you in the future thank you everyone.

She's the kind of awesome girl who makes my gamer friends jealous, but who doesn't really fit with my best friends who are more of a ""general audience"".  Do I try to adjust this, or just hope she grows out of it? Am I an asshole for even thinking about this?**  

I've been dating this girl for a few months, and I've come to like her a lot, and I know I sound like an asshole for bringing this up, but it's probably set to be the first problem in our relationship.  And in the grand scheme of things, it's not the biggest problem, but I can't help but feel like I'd really like to have a girlfriend who I can be excited to have around my friends.

It's like....have you ever tried to introduce someone a new show/movie that you think is sooo awesome, but when you sit down to watch it, you realize it's either not as great as you remember, or you just happened to show them the worst episode in the series, and then you're stuck sitting next to them for an hour cringing or making excuses while they just sit there humoring you, but you can't stop thinking you're totally being judged by the quality of their experience? Yeah, it's sorta like that.

Basically, my girlfriend, despite being my age (23), is pretty bad at taking social cues, and isn't aware when my friends are just forcing one-phrase responses to be polite.  She exudes that kind of high-school Invader-Zim anime-club attitude where people take pride in being almost psychotically hyperactive, and ""random"".  She also doesn't seem to have a sense for what other people find interesting or funny, often telling stories that have no real punchline or bite.  

Fortunately it isn't as bad as I might make it sound.  She doesn't try to *dominate* conversations with her stories or ramblings (I've met a few people who will go on for really long if you don't stop them), and is very considerate about not interrupting other people and such.  It's just that after she's done talking, I notice that there's usually an uncomfortable silence during which people have nothing else to add, and have to make an effort to bring the conversation back to its original rhythm.  Basically, I can tell they're tolerating her just because they want to be polite, but she probably wouldn't get invited to my friends' gatherings or outings, and I don't know that I would really blame them.  Thing is, my g/f thinks that my friends *really* like her and she's making so many new friends!  I'd feel terrible just telling her that this probably isn't the case.

Her immature social attitude is something I'm kinda hoping she'll grow out of eventually, and it's something that I don't mind in private.  I'm more of laid-back person who prefers to only add commentary to a conversation when it's particularly witty or interesting, and making sure to keep it brief when there are bigger crowds.  So it's nice to let her drive the conversation with her random musings when we're alone.  

Her bouncy, over-the-top personality keeps me entertained, but I enjoy being with her the way I enjoy playing video games.  A private pleasure that I enjoy immensely, but I know better than to bring them up during conversations with general audiences because most people aren't interested.  

It's not a dealbreaker for me, because I'm really loving everything else about her.  We share a lot of the same interests, and despite her seeming immaturity, she's a very considerate person.  She is mature where it really counts - educated, hard-working, driven, positive, loyal, and rational.  Probably more than I deserve in some of these areas.  She doesn't cling to traditions, she's affectionate without being smothering, and she plays a mean game of Dungeons and Dragons.  Physically, she's way above my league, the sexual chemistry is awesome, but more importantly, she's someone who has displayed an ""Open communication is the best policy"" attitude towards it, which is both rare and important.  I really feel like this has long-term potential.

What do I do about the fact that I'm ashamed to bring her around my friends?  Is this something I bring up with her, or just keep it to myself and work around it?  Would you feel like your SO is being an asshole if he approaches you with something like ""Look sweetie, I love you, but I think we should talk about how you act around other people.""?  There's a sick sort of sound to the idea that I can ""teach"" her or ""fix"" her in this department.  It sounds too much like demanding she change her personality to suit my needs or whims.

**A little background :**

We've had infinite problems in the past on *his* end with him calling me names and being disrespectful to me in front of my/his/our friends. 

Our most infamous moment with this (it would take **FAR** too long to recount all of said moments) was when we went out for drinks with one of *my* friends and one of *his* friends on a particularly fine evening. We **all four** started joking at one point about threesomes, girl-on-girl action, etc., and my friend said something to the effect of ""Well, we all know your dress will be on my floor later,"" playing off the fact that I had borrowed one of her dresses and would (obviously) have to return it. **My boyfriend chimes in** with ""not unless I'm there with a camera"" and the joking carries on. I offer up my own joke about only giving a show if it's a makeout session because the more ""intimate"" moments are special and should be ""just for us girls"", and my boyfriend gets moody and eventually makes an excuse to leave. 

I get up to walk him out to his car and he starts yelling at me **in the middle of the parking lot** and in front of about a dozen complete strangers, calling me a ""cunt"" and a ""whore"" and a ""slut"" for saying the things I had said... and please, bear in mind that I was **only joking**, in much the same way that he was. He then proceeds to jump in his car, leave, call his friend's phone (mine isn't working) demanding to talk to me, call me some more names and then show up **AT THE BAR** with some of the things I'd left at his apartment in a box... still irate and still calling names.

We broke up over shit like this several times, and he's now gotten much better, *much to his credit*. I don't want to be unfair about this, so I need to point out that he has improved, though not completely. 

Now. We've also had problems in the past with me not telling him exactly where I am and what I'm doing, which he calls *""lying by omission""*. If I should so happen to do something and not inform him **immediately**, or make plans and not tell him about them **before they happen/before he asks**, then in his frame of mind I'm ""lying by omission"".

In some cases, he has been *justifiably angry...* I have gone out and spent the night at friends' apartments without telling him beforehand, for example, and I can see where that would be extremely upsetting. **In most cases, however, I see it differently.** I *never* lie to him about where I've been or what I've been doing when he *asks*, and if I do something as unimportant and blase as grabbing a spur-of-the-moment coffee at the campus Starbucks and I just so happen to see someone there and talk to them for half an hour, I don't feel that he needs a play-by-play of those events. =/

**Today's situation**

One of these kinds of situations arose today. I was studying and needed to share some notes with an acquaintance of mine who is in one of my classes. We met up at a copier on campus and then I decided that since I was hungry and the university cafe was right across the street, I would go have some lunch. I called my boyfriend (in response to a missed call) and asked what he was doing, to which he whispered a barely discernible ""I'm in the library studying"". I told him I was on the way to the cafe and asked if he wanted anything to eat. He said yes, so I told him I'd bring him some food. I then asked my study buddy if he wanted to tag along to the cafe and he responded to the affirmative, so we spent 30 minutes eating and then I grabbed lunch for my boyfriend and took it to him (the library is on the way back to my dorm). 

When I arrived at the library to deliver my boyfriend's food to him (in his group study room, where he was with one of our mutual friends), he asked me ""what took so long"" and I told him I ate at the cafe. He then asked who I was with and I told him. He then proceeded to tell me to not say another word about wanting to spend time with him until finals are over because I *""had an opportunity to spend a little spare time with him and passed it up to eat with some other guy""*, citing the fact that *""I didn't even ask him if he would be interested in eating with me""*. I told him that he was missing a lot in that statement, namely that 

* **(1)** he sounded like he was too busy to even talk to me, so it was natural for me to assume that he wouldn't have time to eat ***with*** me;

* **(2)** he could have asked me if I would eat with him if that's what he had really wanted, because the asking works both ways;

* **(3)** he completely missed the point that I would have eaten **at the cafe** even if my study buddy had declined my invitation to tag along.

He then proceeded to tell me to just get out, so I told *him* that if he was going to be **this ungrateful** for me bringing him food, then I would just not bother at all in the future. He then proceeded to say **""yeah, whatever, fuck off""** as I was walking out the door... once again, **IN FRONT OF OUR FRIEND**. 

I gave it 15 minutes and then sent him **this text** :

*""How about I up the ante on this one, k? You call me when you're ready to apologize, but otherwise I don't want to talk to you. That's one too many times you've blatantly disrespected me in front of people, so if you want me to 'fuck off', your wish is my command. Good luck on finals and I'll talk to you when you decide that I'm worth more than that.""*

His response was **this text** :

*""I want you to understand what happened. You went to eat lunch with someone and intentionally withheld telling me. Even when I asked what took you so long you just told me you decided to eat there. You made me have to ask you who you were with because I knew you weren't alone. And weren't you already all out of strikes and crying about how you could change? I believe so. This is the best you can do? We have a problem.""*

He then **called me** and proceeded to tell me that he wasn't *""going to have a text war with me""* and began to argue that I had *""lied to him yet again""* because I *""intentionally left details out""* and furthermore *""made him ask more than one question to get the whole story.""* 

Later, he sent **this text** :

*""You more often than not intentionally leave out the part where you were with someone else. I always have to ask or get it our of you some way other than having you just willingly tell me when I ask ""What are you doing?"" I've been over this with you time and time again on this very subject so don't even try to play ignorant. I'm sick and fucking tired of never getting the truth from you. It was just a week ago that we were having this out for the thousandth time and you wanted so badly to have another chance because you said you would do better. So, is this the 'better'? Because if it is, we will need to have a talk. If this isn't the 'better' and you just fucked up again because you weren't trying then own up to that. Either way, there is a very serious problem here.""*

**Seriously... let me outline the facts again.**

* **(1)** I always tell him who I was with when he asks. Otherwise I don't consider it important. Never do I lie to him about who I've been with or what I've been doing when the question is posed. Also, 95% of the time, I do NOT do anything that *by action alone* would cause him to be upset, so it's not like I'm withholding information and hiding illicit, non-relationship-friendly activities. (I say 95% because I'm certainly not perfect, but even that 5% isn't heinous.)

* **(2)** He flips out like this over almost everything... whether it be something as simple as a spur-of-the-moment lunch or not.

* **(3)** What he keeps referring to in his texts is another similar situation in which I decided to go Black Friday shopping with one of my best friends and texted him to tell him about it en route to Target at 5 am. His beef then was that I made plans and didn't text him to tell him about it until I was already carrying them out... thereby again ""intentionally withholding information"", ""lying by omission"" and ""informing him only as an afterthought"". In **that** case, I apologized and cried and begged for forgiveness to get him to leave me alone about it... mainly because he threw a tantrum at 1:30 AM one fine day, harassed me about it incessantly and threatened to break up with me over and over again. (yay)

He then started to say that he wasn't getting any sex even though we were doing it 2-3times a week - Id say not bad for a couple with a new baby.  
I should also note here that 4mths before the baby was born he had been made redundant and so was struggling with this blow to his self esteem - in the last 6mths though he has found a new job with equivalent pay and seems to be a lot happier.
Following on from this when bub was 9months old I found a receipt on the kitchen bench from a brothel (Had his name and signature on it) he denied going and blamed it on a mate, who then told me this was not true, he had never been so it must have been my husband.  From here we had been working together to resolve our issues and stay together.  I felt that things had improved however he rarely wants to have sex with me at all, and usually turns me down if I make any advances.  
Then last wednesday a text message came through on his phone and I just happened to see it - it said 'Lee's on thurs night babe sorry bout late reply x'  - when I confronted him he said it was a brothel but he was only texting them - we had an argument about it and he said the last 8yrs with me have been shit, so i kicked him out.  He came back twice the next day with flowers yet showed no remorse, he stayed that night on the couch and then I asked him 'how he could say the last 8yrs have been shit and if so why would he have even got married' - he didnt really answer me, got angry and left.  He has come over everynight since, I haven't really talked to him, he just visits our son for 1-2hrs then leaves.  He said last night before he left that he wants to try and fix the situation and is going to a psycologist next week.
I can't believe I ended up in a situation like this.  I don't want to be a single parent but I also believe I have the right to a husband that respects me and does not see prostitues.

Lately, when she picks up my son from me, she's been chewing gum, and the strong smell of alcohol is detectable over the scent of the gum from 3-4 feet away.  I've known her for 20 years, and I'd also estimate that she's intoxicated, based on having seen her drink while we were together.

When she picks him up, she's usually driving.  Relinquishing my son to someone driving drunk makes me sick.  However, as I can't really prove that she's intoxicated, my fear is that I'll end up in court for refusal to comply with our custody order.  I've debated calling the police when she's there, but don't know if they'll help me.  Any advice?

--Edit--

Sent her this via email:

A few times recently when you've picked XXXX up from me, I've noticed the strong smell of alcohol on your breath.  I noticed the odor despite the gum you were chewing in each of those cases. I was able to detect the alcohol odor from a distance of 3 feet plus from you.  I seriously considered not relinquishing XXXX to you when these incidents occurred. Please refrain from consuming alcohol when you're picking up XXXX, particularly when you have to drive an automobile to do so. If something like this happens again, I will proceed immediately to the nearest police station with XXXX, and will insist on exchanging custody at that police station, so that you can potentially have a breathlyzer administered to you.

Please understand, my concern here is for XXXX's safety and well-being.  I am specifically not copying my attorney on this, as I wish to preserve the relatively harmonious relationship we've enjoyed lately.  I think that relationship is good for both of us, and for our son. I know this email will make you angry and defensive, and I'm truly sorry for that.  However, as XXXX's father, I don't feel as if I have any other choice other than to confront this issue directly.

--Son of Edit--


I've spoken with her several times since I sent that email, and she's said nothing about it. I'm truly not surprised, as I don't think what she did was defensible.  We'll see how this plays out long term.

Update: Awesome. Over Christmas, while my son was with me, ex got popped for a DUI.  Her BAC was .233, nearly 3 times the legal limit in our state.

I have some past trauma about anal penetration (that he is aware of) and generally panic. I started saying ""No, No, No, No, please don't"" very loudly and then tried to get up and crawl away. He is a very strong man and pulled me back about three times before I stopped trying and just whimpered and begged him not to. I thought he would stop but he did it anyway. I completely freaked out and started to buck wildly and cry. He seemed surprised and took it out (it was a vibrating egg thing) and said ""Wow, you really freaked out"". He didn't seem to understand, though, because he tried to continue the sex after that. I've tried to have a few conversations with him about it but he doesn't seem to think it's a big deal. I don't want to just forget about it and move on, I need him to help rebuild trust. I don't know what to say to him without being accusatory or hyperbolic. Has anyone had an experience like this? Is it crazy for me to consider leaving him over this?

I'm not going to press charges. We've talked about it now, he apologized(and was mortified, very upset) and he assured me that nothing like that would ever happen again. He, like what seems to be most of the men here, thought I was blowing things out of proportion; nonetheless he heard me out. So thank you to all.

I have been in a relationship for 5 years with a girl that I thought I would marry.  Last week while she was back home she ended up hanging out with a guy that she has a history with back in high school.  At the end of the night, she went to his room and made out.  She claims there were no emotional investments in him and it was a mistake partially caused by alcohol.

The details of the cheating were that they both mutually started making out, and it lasted 30 seconds.  

The thing that absolutely kills me is that it was mutual, and lasted that long...  I have been unable to sleep, all I can do is count to 30 and realize how long that is.  If it was an unintentional mistake she would have stopped it prior to that??  I understand it could have been worse but It's enough for me to suspect emotional investment in this guy.  And it kills me. 

Today I decided to end our relationship even though she is remorseful and claims that it is the biggest regret of her life.  I believe her but I can't get her doing that out of my head.

I'm pissed and hurt.  Even if she didn't do it out of attraction I feel like our relationship would never be the same.

*I am 25/M, she is 25/F and we have been together for 6 years*

**Edit:**  Thank you everyone for helping me get my head around this.  It is plainly clear that I haven't spent enough time exploring the deep, dark corners of the internet. I do feel like my perceptions surrounding this fetish have come around.  I will always love this girl, and now that I am a little more comfortable with the concept- I find little surprises like this to be alluring. I almost want to surprise her with a bit of hair tugging or something equally out of character.   I really want to let her know that I'll push my comfort zone for her- without letting on that I know what she is into!
**Edit 2:**  I've made a post in r/BDSMcommunity in case you have had any first hand experiences along these lines.  [I'm hoping for some domination for dummies material.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMcommunity/comments/1dh8yi/gf_is_into_rape_fantasy_porn_anything_vanilla_me/) *NSFW*
  

I came home from work and my fiancee left her computer open on the bed.  Her toys were out and she was asleep, so I went to move the laptop and tuck her in.  My curiosity got the better of me.

I consider myself to be pretty open minded.  She and I are incredibly close and while we don't generally have issues communicating, I am so distraught over what I have seen I don't know how to bring it up.  I don't know what I would say, what I would hope to achieve from the talk, or what I would want to hear her say.

We have watched porn together before.  I have told her (and showed her) what I like to watch.  Over the years, I showed her some of my favorite Kink sites that focus on bondage.  She was very receptive and we got into some more risque bedroom play.

So I'm stumped.  She allows me to have my privacy on the internet and I want to reciprocate the favor.  I know that she wouldn't be mad if I told her what I have seen, but she would be MORTIFIED.  I just cant stand the thought of her getting aroused by something that is so degrading and disturbing.  

I am pretty sure that we all agree that I will eventually need to talk to her about it, but before then I need to process this and try to pinpoint what I need to do to help myself first.  I feel like there is a huge part of her that I don't understand, and that scares me.

[NSFW- This is what she was watching. -NSFW](http://www.perfectgirls.net/159755/Brutal_BDSM_banging_gets_this_pretty_pale_)

*TL,DR-  I snooped on her browser before she had a chance to clear it.  The things that she watches are abusive, degrading, violent and completely unlike her.  How do I get over being as upset as I am?

I am confused when I look back three years ago and try to understand what happened. Part of me feels like she didn't cheat on me because she was open with me until I questioned her online relationship. Up until this happened I naively thought that in order for her to be cheating on me there had to be intimate physical contact. In fact, that was her main justification of the relationship--nothing physical was happening. I still struggle to say, ""Yes, she had an emotional affair.""

Well, things seemed to go well and I didn't get really nervous or shy like I always do. Good vibes. :) So that evening I asked her if she'd like to watch a movie with me the following evening. She accepted.

I don't have a car or a driver's license so I pulled all the strings I could to get a friend to drive me to her place where I picked her up for the movie. When we got to the theater and bought tickets, we still had about 30 minutes to kill so we went to a nearby bookstore and just talked about this and that. Common interests, family, future goals. Overall the best part of the date. When we watched the movie it was kinda awkward and all we did was watch the movie without saying a word (The movie was horrible, something about Abraham Lincoln being a vampire hunter) After the movie we took her to her house and I escorted her to the front door. My heart was racing and I didn't really know what to do. I could kind of tell that she was expecting a kiss but as I leaned in I failed and hugged her. lol I blushed and told her the truth that this was my first date and she told me it was okay and that it was cute. She also told me we should do this again sometime. I felt totally awkward at this time so I did my awkward dance and fled the scene like Zoidberg.

There is zero romance involved, I have to practically make an appointment for later that night; she lays there stiff as a board complaining she's too hot/too cold/too itchy; also no touching the boobies when she was breast feeding.
 
At first I felt I was being a selfish dick that the lack of sex made me upset and sometimes angry. We've had a few arguments about it but my wife puts it down to cultural differences (she is Japanese; apparently Japanese couples don't  have sex very often after a few years of marriage.) 

We have been in separate bedrooms for a couple of years now. Lately my wife has been talking about having another child. I think it’s a terrible idea. I love my daughter dearly but , with our marriage being so unhappy (for me at least) , I’m reluctant to make any future separation harder by having another kid. 
Sorry for the shitty writing. This has been eating away at me for a long time and it was hard to get out. I guess I'm just looking for confirmation that this lack of sex is not normal in a healthy marriage.

Been together just over a year this round, dated for 5 years during our late teens/early 20s. Split on good terms, he wanted to marry/breed, I was not ready. I lived with girlfriends, light travel, and moved away to college instead. 

My problem is this: He has absolutely no concept of spelling, grammar, capitalization, or punctuation. All I have asked of him is to use periods to separate thoughts/ideas. I can decipher the non-existent grammar, spelling, capitalization, but trying to follow his thoughts as one long-ass run on message can be near impossible. When I ask for clarification he says I am being stuck up. And tells me he finds it funny that a college educated person cannot figure out his texts. I only ask for clarification maybe once every week or two, and only when I want to be sure on something (seemingly) important.

I understand that with the grammar/spelling-nazi environment of reddit I may not find others who will take up his side, but I want to ask how to go about cluing him in on the importance of legible communication. Personally I see it as a lack of respect to the recipient. 

I don't mean to say he does not respect me, but when I am communicating via text, be it email, snail mail, or messaging, I try to make a point of getting my ideas across in an easily understood manner. I mean the respect comment as a general matter, not a personal slight from him against myself.

He is really sweet, and sends precious messages daily. When I get these and cannot quite understand what he means word-for-word, I just accept his warm fuzzy feelings. But sometimes I need to know what he wants me to know from his texts. He has, as of last night, decided to never text me again. So far no texts, but we have been chatting on the phone a bit more than usual.

We vary widely in our education; he was home-schooled and ended up dropping out of high school, where I am graduating with my BA in a few days (this is my second profession). He is crazy bright, just not educated. I am of average intelligence and very educated.

Am I being a snob? What can I say to get him to decipher impossible messages without offending him? 

This is not a deal breaker or anything, but basic communication seems, well, basic.

My boyfriend is 21, and I'm also 21. We're living together temporarily. There are actually two problems: a) he is touchy-feely and b) he has terrible hygiene. 

When we lived apart he was never grosser than your typical end-of-the-day funk. Now he 'comes to bed' without brushing his teeth, washing his hands or showering. He has a strong aroma and it REALLY puts me off sex. His finger nails have hurt me numerous times because he often refuses to care for them. I've made it extremely clear to him that his breath and b.o. are major turn-offs, but he continues to initiate sex without cleaning up.

The other issue is his constant touching. He never just hugs me, it's always ""Hey girl..."" and then his hands are in my underwear.* He has a way of making me feel like meat. I've explained this to him, but the best he could do was stop touching me innapropriately in public. 

 We haven't had sex (excluding handjobs/blowjobs for him) in over a month and I'm reaching my limits of frustration (emotional and sexual).  

Please help me get through to him. We both find each other attractive and it baffles me why we can't have a normal sex-life.

1317828060.0,62,self.relationship_advice,l1s1a,Feeling uncomfortable about how many sexual details my boyfriend has given his friends...,weirdedoutthrowaway,72,10,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/l1s1a/feeling_uncomfortable_about_how_many_sexual/,"I'm a 25/f, dating 25/m. Been together over a year and a half. We live together, lots in common, have a great sex life, all-around things usually feel perfect. We were pretty casual when we first started hooking up (didn't have the ""should we be exclusive?"" discussion until about 4 months into hanging out); it's clear I was way more emotionally attached way sooner than he was and I think this makes me insecure, so sometimes I have to try not to be irrational about certain feelings.

We're on each other's laptops all the time and (so far as I know) never had an issue with trust or privacy. We were getting ready to watch a movie and I was closing a bunch of windows on his laptop when I saw one that had his gmail open, but it was open on an email titled something like ""Balls deep in the horniest girl I've ever met."" This was relevant to my interests so I didn't stop looking. It was obviously an email talking about boning a girl. I felt like I was about to throw up until I scrolled down, saw a bunch of Facebook pictures of myself and realized it was about me. The date on the email looked to be about a week or so after we started having sex. It was sent to one of his friends (who I have met and hung out with many times). I have no idea why he'd have open an email from so long ago, except that it looked like he saved (resaved?) some of the pictures from the email to his computer. Not sure why he'd do this since he's always had access to my facebook pics and could have easily just saved them from my profile. 

The email went into A LOT of detail about what my body looked like and quite a few of my sexual proclivities. It was pretty crude and made me feel weirdly exposed, but he didn't say anything hurtful or critical. I guess I was just taken aback by how much detail was there. The part that stuck out to me, though, was this line, which I remember verbatim: ""she's such a freak, I'm sure she'll let me make a videotape (of which I'll happily send you a copy)."" WTF. It's embarrassing, too, because we DID make videos, way later in our relationship when we started dating more seriously. I've also sent him a crapload of naughty pictures. I've made it pretty clear that I would be embarrassed for anyone besides him to see them. We share a life together and tell one another everything, so some faceless gonewild-esque pictures have never seemed like that big a deal to me (until now, I guess).

I pressed the back button and saw that he sent a bunch of similar emails to about 4 of his other guy friends. I met his friends pretty soon into our relationship and I had no idea they all had a run-down of what I look and sound like during sex before even meeting me. I'll admit it's kind of humiliating. 1 of the emails was just FB pictures (all my FB pics are very standard/tame), but the other messages all went into similar detail. 

It also bothers me because one time he asked if I would be mad if he showed his friends naked pictures of me. I said I would be mad and asked if he had already done that. He said no and we got in a huge fight for the rest of the night. He assured me that, HYPOTHETICALLY, IF he were to do it, it would just be because he was ""so proud"" that he was ""getting to bang"" me and to prove to his friends that my boobs were real. These sounded like the most horrible reasons ever to me, and it wasn't until the morning-after that he relented and said it would be a shitty thing to do.


I really, REALLY wanted to go through his email and see if he had sent anyone anything more ""intimate"" of me, but I felt really guilty and just ended up closing everything. 

I do intend to confront him about this, but I was hoping for a little perspective from other people first. I feel really embarrassed that a bunch of his friends know so much about me, and I feel like he didn't really care about me or my feelings and was just using me as a way to get high fives from his pals or something. Personally, I don't really talk nitty-gritty sex stuff with my girlfriends. We might talk about sex very generally but I've never had a conversation about specific guys' bodies or what they did or liked during sex, even if the guys weren't serious boyfriends. However, people have told me that's not the norm, so am I being kind of a baby about this? 

**EDIT: Holy crap you guys. I went to bed when this had 2 replies and now there are a lot. Thanks everyone for responding, you've  given me a lot more confidence in at least talking to him about this. I'm going to talk to him about it today and I'll post an update afterwards. P.S.

My boyfriend got a new job a few months back that requires 70 hrs a week, 3rd shift; our love life went right out the window.

I volunteered to help in every way possible to alleviate his stress: cleaning his place, cooking for him, helping with his homework, doing laundry, and making what little sex we had all about him and his needs.   After a few months of this it started taking its toll on me, making me stressed out, irritable and resentful.  We never had time for anything, let alone to talk, and I sat here Forever Alone all night on Reddit feeling your pain.

Well, based on all the comments around here and with my own needs howling for me to do something, I approached him as sensitively as possible to say that it was becoming too much for me and that I need sex in a relationship.  That I understand that he's tired and stressed but I have needs, that I'm only 25 and not ready to be taken for granted and lonely.  Because on top of being tired all the time and not putting out, he would hardly say thanks for me doing so much for him, and would still find time to play Fallout New Vegas and Halo while I just sat there feeling neglected.  (Does this sound familiar girls?)

He seemed to understand, but things still continued, and I still felt like crap.  So, last week I told him that I have had enough and that I think I wanted to take a break.  He seemed shocked, and that's not what I really wanted... and then I remembered a trick I learned in therapy.

""When you (insert specific behavior here), I feel (hurt/scared/unappreciated/whatever you are feeling).  I need for you to (specific behavior you'd like from him).""  There's also an option to add a consequence to the end of the statement.  (I found a website that goes into detail on this--&gt; http://www.compassioncoach.com/how_and_when_to_use_i_statements)

Basically I said I need more romance and need to be touched in order to feel desired and wanted.  I pointed to specific examples of his past actions that made me feel loved/appreciated/sexy/etc: 

""That time you closed and locked the door behind me when I came in, and took my clothes off without saying a word, I was really turned on and felt like you couldn't take your hands off of me, and it really made me feel sexy.""

""When you come in from work and go straight to your Xbox, I feel like you take me for granted.  I need you to let me know that you don't think I'm your mom and that you appreciate the things I do for you; by that I mean I need you to give me a kiss when you come in and communicate that you need an hour or two to unwind, and STICK to that, and then spend time with me afterward.""

Well, being specific really worked for me.  He has been a changed man ever since that talk... maybe not CHANGED per se, but more like he was before getting this job.  

Last week he came home from work with roses and a teddy bear for me and came directly to show affection to me and tell me how much he loves me before passing out on the couch... another day he said, ""I'm gonna play my game til 3,  after that you do want to go for a walk?""... yesterday he cleaned his apartment before I came over, cuddled with me on the couch, then turned off the TV and took me to bed for the kind of sex we used to have.  In fact, we've been having lots of sex since that talk.  :)  

I was so grateful, and all it took was good communication.  I don't think communication comes naturally for all of us and it's something we have to work at.  I think ultimately though, if you love each other, you truly do want to please each other.  It's just that you don't always know how.  Spelling it out to your partner and vice versa can be the start of a beautiful future.

tl;dr: COMMUNICATE and get what you want and need, in bed and otherwise.  BE ASSERTIVE if something isn't working for you and see where it gets you.  Be SPECIFIC and he will know what you need and want, and more than likely give it to you.

I hope it helps at least one person.       

* Communication in a relationship is *key*. I know you've heard this before so remember it. If you think you should talk to your SO about something, go ahead and *do it*. They can't read your mind and if there's a problem or something needs to be said, simply coming out and talking about it will make life a lot less stressful and any issues can be cleared up (hopfully) quickly.          

* If you've cheated on someone and want them back, you're probably going to have to try *really* hard to get them back, if they'll take you back. Keep in mind that cheating is an 'end all' for a lot of people, so a simple 'I'm sorry' probably won't cut it.         

* If you like someone, **tell them**. Don't expect them to guess that you have a thing for them. Tell them you like them and grab them before someone else does it first. You can't sit around and pine for them, hoping to get them. Someone with the guts to tell them that they're liked/loved will get them first. Jump in and take the plunge, it can be fun!      

* Stop putting yourself down. Not only is bashing yourself a turn-off, but it puts you at a *huge* disadvantage. If you don't feel you're worthy, then you probably aren't. I know it takes a lot of courage to ask someone out and deal with possible rejection, but remember that rejection will only allow you to move on from a situation that would never go anywhere. The worst that can happen is you move on to someone who might like you. Best that can happen is you get the girl/guy you were going after.      

* If your SO is stand-offish about things (you have to convince them to keep the relationship going and to keep trying; they spend less time with you; you fight more often etc.), something is wrong and the two of you *need to talk about it*. It's not fair to either one of you to stay in a relationship when your hearts aren't in it. Find someone you love and who will love you back, which leads me to...     

* If someone wants to be with you, they will *be with you*. They will want to spend every minute they have free with you, they will call/text you back, they will treat you well. If someone says they like you but only send you occasional texts and rarely calls you, doesn't want to hang out with you, doesn't invite you to things, chances are they don't like you all that much. Find someone who wants to be with you for *you*.

Need Advice!,cbass_1636,70,8,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fwlfd/caught_stepdad_cheating_on_mother_need_advice/,"First off, I am the son of the relationship in question. A little background...

My mother divorced my father about 16 years ago (married for 8 years) and about 1 year later got into in a relationship with my now step-father. She had 4 kids at the time (myself and my 3 brothers) and my stepdad didn't really mind. Objectively, my mother is an attractive woman, even today, and he is somewhat older/less attractive so I'm sure this contributed to him being fine with her having 4 kids from a previous marriage.

He was a fine father figure, if somewhat strict. Didn't really have to much of a role in my own/my brothers' actual rearing (my birth father is still very much involved in our lives even though they're not together and I'm sure this contributed to his lessened role). I was never terribly close with him but respected him as the head of the household and he's been good to my mom for the most part, so whatever makes her happy I'm fine with. They have been together for the last 15 years or so, though they only got married my senior year of high school (I just graduated from college and am now 22), so they have been married about 5 years.

Honestly, I didn't even get an inkling of trouble in their relationship until last year because I was out of state for college. The reason I found out is 1.5 years ago, my mom calls me out of the blue and is crying. She **rarely** cries so I knew this was cause for concern. She says she quit her job 2 weeks ago and wanted to start a business. She was planning on drawing out of her retirement fund to support her the next few months and using that as start up money. Even I, a Junior in college at the time, knew that was a *horrible* idea and did my best to rectify the situation. I had saved up some money (about 11k) from a school job/scholarships/internships and used that to pay her bills for the next two months. I called her job and eventually got them to reinstate her part-time with an option to be fully reinstated if she kept at it.

Turns out, the reason she had this mental breakdown is she found out my step-father had a girlfriend on the side. They had split up and were living in 2 separate places (he moved into a small apartment on the other side of town). Needless to say, I was ***fucking pissed*** this had happened but couldn't do much since I was at school. My little brother (who had basically only had my stepdad as a father figure since he was too young at the time to remember living with my dad), took it the hardest. He became sullen and angry, and to this day is still combative with my parents. 

Eventually, my mom and my stepdad ""work it out"" as best they could. Go to some form of therapy (Sex Addicts Anonymous... go figure). I wasn't too sure where the problems stemmed from but apparently this is the best solution they found. Apparently he broke it off with the girlfriend and even though my mom has admitted to having trust issues they moved back in together. My little brother wasn't too happy with this and won't even stay at my moms house anymore (he's living with our real dad), but my mom is somewhat the dependent type and I knew despite her protestations to the contrary she would never leave him or consider divorcing him. Even though she's very attractive for her age, she thinks she would never be able to find anyone else as good as my stepdad. 

Even though things are obviously rocky, for the last year or so they have been getting back on track, going to therapy steadily, and generally getting back to the way things were. My mom expressed some concerns to me a few months ago that my stepdad had contacted his ex-girlfriend (**RED FLAG**) but I guess she saw the texts (or facebook message, idk which) and said they were pretty benign. I told her at this point if he's still talking to her things probably aren't as done as she thought, and she started crying. I told her she'd have my own and all her sons' support if she did leave him (and she said she'd consider it), but I know her and there's no fucking way she'd decide to do that on her own. 

Fast forward to earlier today. I'm back home in California (just graduated), and I get a call from a blocked number. The conversation goes something like this: 

&gt;**Her**: ""Hi, is '*my stepdad's name*' there?"" 

&gt;**Me**: ""No, not at the moment... who is this? And how'd you get this number"" 

(I thought it was a telemarketer and was confused as to why they called *my* number)

&gt;**Her**: ""This is '*my stepdad's name*' girlfriend. He told me to call this number in case of emergency""

&gt;**Me**(*suspicious as fuck now*): ""No he's not here at the moment. Sorry, how did you say you know *'my stepdad's name'*?""

&gt;**Her**: ""I'm his girlfriend.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Ohhhh, gotcha. Yeah... well... he's not here at the moment. Sorry about that""

&gt;**Her**: ""Okay, nevermind. Bye.""

Now at this point, I'm flabbergasted. First of all, from the conversation, it's painfully obvious that my stepdad is still cheating on my mom. Secondly, what kind of *fucking idiot* stepfather gives their girlfriend his stepson's phone number in case of emergency? (And I'm almost positive it wasn't a real medical emergency... part of the reason this extramarital relationship was such a problem is that my stepdad was giving his girlfriend a ton of financial support... pretty sure she needed money). 

I was about to call my stepdad and tell him to get out of my mom's life (along with a few choice 12 and 4 letter expletives), but I hesitated. First of all, I don't really know what the nature of my stepdad and his ""girlfriend's"" relationship really is. She may just be trying to extort him or something (I doubt it, but who knows?). Second (and more important), is the fact that I have no idea how my mom is going to react. Last time she quit her job, completely abandoned my younger brother who was still in high school at the time, drained the family's resources (including my own 11k), and had a mental breakdown trying to start a business when she has no clue how to get it off the ground yet. 

Further complicating matters is that my mom and stepdad just moved back in together to a new place (renting), and my older brother and his wife moved in with them... and my brother and his wife are expecting in about a month as well. To be honest, I'm not sure if approaching it from that standpoint is the best way. I want the best for my family and my mother (who is working on being fully reinstated to her job). In that sense I don't want to rock the boat too much and risk my mother going crazy and them losing the place.

On the other hand, I want what's best for my mom, and despite the advantages of them staying together (stated above), I'm pretty sure my stepdad is still cheating on her and that **sucks**. 

The way I see it, I can approach it from a few different angles: 

1. Go with my initial gut instinct and tell my stepdad to fuck off, consequences be damned. 

2. Talk to my stepdad and find out what the extent of him and his ""girlfriend's"" relationship is. Maybe it's nothing. Maybe it's something. 

3. Tell my mom. She deserves to know the truth, and even though they've been going to a form of therapy, it's obvious that this stuff isn't working.

4. Just let it stew. My mom is just getting back on track, she's about to be fully reinstated to her job that she's had for the past 17 years. My brother is about to have a child and if they lost the house due to my stepdad moving out it'd be devastating for them. And who knows? Maybe things between my mom and my stepdad will work themselves out (I doubt it but crazier things have happened). 

To be honest, I'm leaning towards a combination of option 2 and 4... I resent the fact that I'm even willing to let my mom stay in this fucked up relationship for even a second longer, but I understand it's hard when you've been with a person for 15+ years... she doesn't want to give up on him and I don't blame her. It's hard moving into the unknown. I know I have to tell her eventually, but even if I did I'm almost certain she'd end up with him again. It's hard seeing that your parents aren't the smartest people on the planet and make dumb mistakes just like the rest of us. 

I'm only 22 though and have been in exactly 1 ""long term"" relationship (a total of 2.5 years) and would really appreciate some input/advice on what to do. 


**TL;DR:** Mom and stepdad together 17 years, married for 5. Cheats on mom 2 years ago but they get back together. I get a call from his ""girlfriend"" today giving me suspicions he's back at it again. Having issues deciding to tell her or let it be for a while due to complicated family situations.

Okay, so I have had some long talks with my wife over the past couple of days, and I've learned a few interesting things. First, she really feels like she needs to have a break from my sexual energy. What happens for her is that she sees me constantly coming at her, and when that happens, all she wants to do is retract further in order to be safe. Yeah, some of that is because of her childhood abuse issues. But some is also just a life stage thing - she's done having sex for procreation, and wants to discover her sexuality post-children and post-procreation. And, for whatever reason, she wants to do that first by herself.

So, what am I going to do? I can't force her to have sex with me - or even to sleep with me for that matter. All I can do is respect her boundaries, and try to learn as much as possible about her needs and wants, to see if there's a way we can intersect that will get my needs for physical intimacy addressed. That doesn't mean it's not frustrating.

After reading all of your great comments and advice, I think my best course of action is to get myself some ongoing support from a therapist of my own; and, I have also decided that because she can't give even a rough timeline of how long she'll need to have a break for, **I am going to set my own time line**. I am deciding to stop pursuing her physically **for the next two weeks** and I'll happily report back how that goes. I think I need to take control over the situation, and oddly, that means **I need to be the one to say ""no sex""**. My hope is that after two weeks of experiencing me not pursuing her, she'll actually get the space she needs, and will start coming to me for physical affection.

All this being said, I'm conscious that I'm not okay with a sexless marriage continuing for much longer, and so if this stretches into the summer, I'm going to have a straight talk with my wife about how I can start getting my sexual needs met elsewhere. Hopefully something could be worked out that allows us to stay together - maybe I get involved in kink activities, become an erotic massage model for training courses, take on a FWB, etc.. These things all seem pretty remote possibilities right now, but as I said, I'm not okay with this sexless marriage going on for much longer.

Again, many thanks for all your great comments and advice. I'll update you so stay tuned.

**Update**

Talked with my therapist and he encouraged me - as a short term solution - to give my wife the two week break from touching, and also to invest some energy into self-pleasuring (masturbation, fantasizing, self-care, etc.). This is not a long term solution, but for the short term, it's really the best I can do. At the end of the two weeks, he recommended letting her know that I have consciously stopped touching her in order to respect her boundary, and then finding out what it was like for her and what the next steps could be for us.

So I just had my first mother's day with my wife and young baby.

For a number of reasons it didn't end well. My wife is really upset and had a pretty crap day.

My idea for Mother's day was sleep in as late as she wanted,  a nice card and a gift 'from bub' and to spend time as a family enjoying the things we love to do with our daughter and not doing anything we don't want to do. (housework, cooking changing nappies etc) I was going to take care of all those things. I was going to cook breakfast, spend the day at the aquatic centre, a cafe on the way home and a play in the park followed by a nice cooked dinner and Game of Thrones in bed.  We did some of those things. With lots of tears in between.

My wife instead wanted something 'organised' and 'special'. It was just like 'any other day' And because I hadn't planned anything specific she felt neglected and disappoint.  

I tried to reason with her that to me it was a day we could relax and enjoy each other's company and spend time with our daughter but it kept coming back to me not being organised and I was 'making the day up as it went along'

I don't think she will see my point of view.  I found it strange that someone would be so upset at the thought of spending the day with their family? The more I reinforced it the angrier she got.  In the end I let her go and I slept in the spare room.

I think she overreacted and thing she could have had a special day if she wanted to. Instead she resigned herself to being upset.

I don't want her to be upset but I don't want to go back to her grovelling like dog with it's tail between its legs.

Should I plan a day that she pictured next weekend and go all out to make up for it? How can I recover from this? 

We are both 32. We have been together for about 10 years and married 18 months

**TLDR** - My wife is upset that I didn't organise anything 'special' for Mother's day. I thought a day as a family doing everything she liked and nothing she didn't would be great.

She is a good mother, a bit strict sometimes, but very committed.

She left her home country to be with me.
However, in the eight years that she has lived here, she has not built up any kind of network. She seems unable to make friends. In addition to that she seems to have a subtle but devastating effect on my social life. I don’t quite know how to explain it, but she’s very judgemental and I feel that I would have a much more active social live if she didn’t hold everybody up to such high standards.

This is just one of the many ways in which I feel “snowed under” in this relationship.
I wish I could describe it better, but don’t feel like I’m myself when I’m with her.

The last years I have been consumed by a very strong feeling of discontent. I have not told her this, because I think it is not something she can do anything about. 
It’s not what she does, it’s what she is so to speak.

I think we do a good job of raising our kids and she seems very happy with me.
So the only problem is that I am actually totally unhappy and depressed.
I’ve been in a state of mild depression over this for several years now. Add to that the guilt I feel for having a third child, knowing that the relationship wasn’t working for me at all anymore.
And the panic I feel when I think about having to grow old together.

I went to a therapist, who flat-out advised me to get a divorce.

I’ve been contemplating divorce for a while now, but there are big issues with that:
-She has no network of friends or family to support her and it would be very traumatic for her.
-I shudder to think what her life would look like as a divorced mother with few social contacts.
-She has a major health problem (periods of extreme fatigue, and other issues) so she can’t get a job and I do a lot of the work with the kids (feeding dressing, taking to school etc). My mother thinks she’s a hypochondriac who uses the medical thing to keep me on a short leash.
-The kids. Jesus, I really don’t want to do this to them.
-I am consumed by feelings of guilt.

So based on the above I have decided a hundred times to just tough it out, as it seems the best for everybody. But the price seems to be that I will have to live a life of bitterness and depression.
This situation is turning me into someone very cynical and bitter. 

another thing I’m thinking about is trying to redefine the relationship and claw back some of the life I had before I got married. Going out by myself, see the friends she disapproves of.

But at best I think I can make the relationship more bearable for me.

We met at uni and lived together for the full time we were both there. I got on another course meaning I moved away to a different university, whilst he got a job. The long distance thing was tough on us, especially me. We found ourselves arguing a lot, and my course is incredibly demanding so I was constantly tired and couldn't find the time to speak to him.

At the end of last October I broke it off. We were both devastated. But my idiotic logic back then was if we break up now we wont become bitter towards each other and hate each other after months of long distance and not seeing each other enough. 

About two months after this, I slept with someone else. I have never in my life felt more empty and hollow and disgusting. I regret it so much. It just made me realise what a huge mistake I made breaking up with him. Now ever since then I have been torturing myself and regretting our break up. We still speak quite a lot, via text. And in all honesty I just want to go back to the way things were. But I feel completely unworthy of him now having slept with someone else, I don't even know how I would go about telling him. 

All I can think of is how amazingly he treated me, he was so kind and caring. I really, really fucked up. But in my selfish mind all I want to do is have him back.

Also, I'll be using different names for my sister, her husband and myself.

Sister: Kim
Her husband: Nick
Myself: Anne

About two years ago, whilst I was living in another state, my sister Kim informed me that she was engaged. I had not met this man, nor did I ever hear anything regarding them dating or anything. I had come to find out they had met through mutual friends through their church, and had only gone out for a few weeks before he had popped the question. I was very surprised by all of this, but after talking to my parents, they informed me he was a very nice guy, and his family was very wonderful.

I ended up meeting Nick when I had moved back home, and he was in fact a very nice guy. Same with his family. From there on out, we never had any problems. Everyone got along, the wedding went fantastic, and from there onward their marriage always seemed fine and normal.

About 6 months after, we started to notice a shift in Nicks personality. Especially when it was just himself alone with my husband and I. He would curse profusely, discuss vulgar subjects, even go into stories about his exploits with drugs and partying. (I have nothing against someone doing any of these things, but coming from someone who labeled himself a very strict god-fearing man, it was shocking to my husband and I, especially when he had never behaved like this before.)

The four of us would go out whenever we visited each other, and we noticed Nick's behavior change very rapidly once he had begun drinking. He became loud, obnoxious, and VERY angry. Any small incident would set him off. For instance, one night we had gone out dancing and a young woman happened to accidently bump into him while we were on the dancefloor. He became furious and screamed in this poor girls face. Berating her and even knocking her drink out of her hand. I took my sister aside to try and talk to her, but she would just tell me, ""Oh, he's just drunk, just forget about this, he'll be fine."" An excuse that I would hear many more times in the months to come. My husband had taken Nick outside to talk to him and walk him around for a bit to cool him off and see what the hell was wrong. 

Skip forward a few months. These situations have happened repeatedly, and not just while Nick was drinking. He could get angry about which roads we take while going on a trip, or what restaurant my sister decides to stop at for lunch. We all usually tell him to jokingly shut up and calm down, which he then will, but the look on my sisters face when it happens is always a more worried and nervous one.

Most recently, they had come up to visit myself and my parents. The first part of the trip went very well, we had all been getting along great and it actually had been one of the few times where no one felt tense the whole time. Kim, Nick and my mother had gone shopping and during which they came to visit me in my store. With it being near the holidays, we were swamped, and apparently Nick didn't like waiting in line one bit. He threw a fit and threw some clothes around and walked out. During the ride home, my mom confronted him and told him he should feel embarrassed and to stop behaving like a child. He didn't take to well to this, and we found out later that night that he broke a few things on my parents property and damaged my mothers vehicle. (He had broke some garden vases and bent my mothers front bumper and license plates. We thought it was just a vandal but my husband talked a confession out of him.) 

This was our last and final straw and my mother and father decided to try and go about this in an adult fashion and to perhaps just sit and talk about everything and figure out if something was wrong to where he needed help. When my father explained to Nick in a phonecall that he needed to sit with my mother and apologize to her, he stated ""I am not talking to that woman. You are the head of the household, so how about you do your job and talk to just me like a man?"" My father was appalled and when he demanded Nick to talk to my mother, Nick replied with, ""No and good luck ever trying to talk to your daughter again. She'll never see you two ever and don't try to change this,"" and he hung up.

Soon after that, my mother received an email from my sister stating that she didn't want to talk to them ever again and that she was very in love with Nick and would never allow them to talk that way to him. That was all the email said, and my mother hasn't received any contact since then.

That was about 5 days ago, and my parents haven't received any contact, nor have they been able to get through to her. I have received **A** text, but it was a short one that only said, ""Thinking of you, love and miss you!"" I have replied but have gotten no response since. 

Now, since then, my mother FINALLY decided to do a full background check and investigation on this guy. What we've uncovered is absolutely horrifying and we are now scared for my sisters life. We have found:

* He has been arrested numerous times for assault and battery
* He has been arrested numerous times on drug charges
* He owns a house in another state
* He has moved every two years since moving out, possibly due to him running from charges or something else.
* He had physically and emotionally abused his previous wife, almost killing her and putting her into a hospital. 

We got in contact with his ex-wife, (who is being an incredible help right now to us and providing us with great information and reports.) and she informed us that he in an incredibly dangerous man. He has beaten her, put her outside during winter in just her underwear, threatened to kill her animals, choked her unconscious, put her into a hospital, threatened her family, EVERYTHING.

At this point we really don't know what to do. My sister has no clue of ANY of this, and we are scared that any type of confrontation with him or even her to where he gets upset that he will take it out on her and hurt her. 

We are planning to leave tomorrow to catch her sometime during her daily errands and tell her everything and show her the reports we have, but what exactly do we do then? I can't have her going home to this lunatic, especially when they live quite a bit away and I have no idea what is happening in their home. 

I need advice or help please, resources, anything. I am desperate and I regarding everything we have seen, heard, and from what his ex has told us, we are scared that this could end up with her in a hospital or with a fate far worse.

Will post TLDR at the bottom. It's a ridiculous tale if you care to read it.

I'm the only only child, and I may be close to lose contact with my parents. This due my mother blaming my wife for all kinds of things.

Me and my wife met online almost 13 years ago. I was 17, she was 18. After a while, she left her home and moved in with me and my parents. All was good, after a few months she found an apartment and went to live on her own but in the same town. I stayed with my parents until I was about halfway through my military service, and moved in with her at age 20.

In the beginning, there was an incident which in hindsight resonates as totally odd. My wife got the notion that there was something wrong between her and my mother. My mother didn't greet her when she came to eat with us, didn't look or speak to her. Just froze her out. At least that's what my wife felt at the time, and after this had gone on for about six months, she asked me if I knew something about it. I asked my mother about it (thinking it must be some misunderstanding), and to my surprise - mom was upset. About what, you ask?

My wife had, according to my mother, not thanked her enough for a few cans of jam given to her. Yes, that was apparently enough to freeze her out.

We worked through this. My wife apologized profusely, though feeling she had done nothing wrong. The incidents didn't stop there, however. My mother felt we took trips to visit my wifes family and friends more than we visited my parents who lived close by. I wrote this off as a culture difference. My parents (mostly mom) are more formal and want an invitation to come and visit us, basically. The wifes family are much more informal, and are greater in numbers which causes more frequent visits for birthdays and so on.

At this point, my mom made accusations that we probably didn't like my parents, that my wife didn't like them and so on and so forth.

This has been coming and going in waves over the years. Things are okay for a while, then out of the blue something is wrong. My mom thinks we don't visit enough, gets upset that my wife doesn't call her, doesn't talk about feelings, don't thank her enough for some other gift, doesn't try on a sweater (gift) when she is presented with it, and so on. Lots of, in my mind, immature stuff.

Note that I can understand some of the complaints by my mother. I too would be sad if I didn't have a very good relationship with my only kids spouse. But mom is special, she is incapable of seeing any flaws of her own, cannot apologize for anything. Ever.

This weekend, at about 2 am, we got an email. Mom said she had trouble sleeping and wanted to ""get some things off her chest"", ""say her peace"" and claimed to ""have been quiet about this long enough"".
Que another rant, blaming my wife for not having a good relationship, for not caring about them when they were ill and to go to the hospital (the fact that I called them both daily for weeks, my wife took initiative to sending flowers apparently doesn't count much), and said that ""maybe you think we are two idiots here, and mock us with your parents and friends"". Mom - wtf?!

I responded the next day, explaining that this had hurt both me and my wife. That my wife is crying and is extremely upset with these accusations, the mocking and the insults. The reply from mom was another display of martyrdom, that she was the one ""suffering"".

Repeatedly my wife has been taking subtle and not-so-subtle abuse from my mother. My wife can show my mom scrapbooking-stuff that she uses and likes, 15 minutes later my mom exclaims that scrapbooking is total crap and people using it are stupid. Yeah, that sort of thing. She is good at telling my wife how my wife is feeling, what my wife is thinking and so on.

In the midst of this, my wife and I have been trying to become parents. For the last six years we have gone through doctors appointments, investigations by the social services and are now certified to adopt. We recieved loads of support when we were going to try IVF, and my parents urged us to go through with it or look into sperm donations (yeah, getting personal up in this subreddit, I don't have the strongest swimmers :) ).
When we once again told them that adoption was our choice and a deep rooted choice, little support has been uttered for this. Not that they dislike it, but we don't feel they are very supportive of our choice.

Last year we were matched with a 15 months old girl, and waited a long time for her. Got pictures and all. This was good with my parents, they liked this idea when it came into something concrete, and not an abstract idea. This july, though, we lost our girl. We didn't get the chance to ever see or meet her, other arrangements were made in the country where she lives. There was no adoption, but we feel as if we have lost a child. Much care from my parents? Hrm, try little-to-none.

Mom has had a rough life emotionally. She lost her dad early and had to assume a sort of provider-role for her little siblings. Her mother didn't treat her with love, but favorited her younger sister. After what we've talked about, this has scarred her emotionally, and a few years with a therapist couldn't fix it really. Another cause of distress is alcohol. She doesn't get blaring drunk, but after a few glasses of wine the emotions come out and the drama can start. IRL, by phone, or by email.

It can be worth mentioning this is a behavior often displayed by my mother. She does nothing wrong, but people around her have a tendency to be painted as bad guys. She accused her own sister and her husband (my aunt and uncle) of trying to cheat some people out of an inheritance, and basically severed all ties to them for a few years. It's only now, six years after, that they have resumed some contact. Through the years, I've heard mom talk about how neighbours are strange, how coworkers are idiots and possibly conspire against her (not as strongly as that, but you get the point).

So. Now there was this email this weekened. We visited this spring and again about 3 weeks ago and had a great time. My wife is fucking fed up with having to take all this crap and apologize for things she hasn't done. Now we are writing a reply mail to my mom, explaining what my wife has gone through over the years. The reply from my mom will no doubt be one of no apologies, no remorse, but filled with indignation and martyrdom.

And so, I stand at risk of losing contact with my parents. Maybe not totally, maybe not forever. I'm not sure. I have no idea where this may end. And in all this, we may get matched with a new child to adopt in the coming months, making things even more complicated.

Redditors have been known for perspective and wisdom before, I hope someone can help me out with some kind words, some experience or.. anything. Please.

**TLDR: I've been together with my wife for almost 13 years, through all of them my mom have accused her (and me) for not liking my parents, choosing my wifes parents over them, for avoiding contact and have frozen out my wife for not thanking enough for presents. Now, a new email accuses my wife of new things, insulting and mocking her. We've had about enough, but the risk of severing contact is naturally extremely upsetting as I'm an only child. I seek advice and experience.**",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_11xspn,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/11xspn/30m_possibly_about_to_lose_contact_with_my/,

He says sex feels better and he feels like he performs better if he waits a few days in between...I don't really notice much of a difference. We both are incredibly attracted to each other, but this time in between sex stuff seems to be an issue.... Sex makes me feel more open and close to him, and its a way for me to connect... Having this issue seems to be creating tension for me. He says things like he has too much on his mind, doesn't feel like he can perform as well, and not enough time...

It has been 4 years since the last child, and she has tried all sorts of diets, exercise plans, and has done well for periods of time.  As of late though, she seems to have given up, has a horrible diet, and has gotten pretty bad about grooming in certain areas. I have been supportive for years, and always tell her she is beautiful, and have legitimately still been attracted to her.  Over the last few months however, this is no longer the case.  She is still interested in having sex, but at this point, I am simply not interested anymore, and it is starting to weigh on me.  Because of my physical distance, I can see that I am hurting her, but I also cannot stand to pretend anymore.  She is a wonderful woman, a great mother, and we still have fun as a family, and I am not the one who had to go through the body trauma of having children, so I feel terrible treating her this way.  But the spark that goes off when you are aroused by someone is simply not there anymore.

I am hoping that someone has gone through a similar situation, and they can help me decide what to do.  I have given up attempting to push her in a direction of fitness, as she always finds an excuse why she cannot do something.  

Personally, I take good care of myself by working out and not eating a lot of garbage, and also share an equal level in our children's care, so this is not a case of her being more exhausted by the home or kids, we share that load equally.

For the most part I'm not a jealous person so I don't care. She goes to school has tons of friends it could be anyone. At some point though (and im embarrassed to admit this) I had her phone while I was alone and I checked it. I know I shouldn't have.. but what I found was a little disconcerting. There wasn't anything explicit per se... but she was at the very least playful. She was texting two guys who she used to know. Old friends. I know they aren't exes and I know that they've never fooled around or anything. But that doesn't make me feel any better. Also... she deleted the conversations at a later time (I ended up checking her phone again.. I know...) meaning she obviously doesn't want me to see these conversations.

Anyways lately when we talk on the phone I can hear her phone going off with incoming text messages and her replying to them (she has me on speaker and types on the phone). This goes on some nights between 12-2am.

I like the idea of leaving my girlfriend as much privacy as possible. I really do. But I'm worried that I'm letting her walk all over me. The problem is that given how I know about these texts (snooping in her phone) I'm really not at all sure how to bring it up. It really freaks me out.

EDIT/ I have been getting professional help. I'm on meds, but they only seem to make a difference when I DON'T take them. Also, he's cheating on her and telling everyone that they are just friends, but she thinks she's in love with the dick.

EDIT// He dumped her. She's heartbroken. He ruined over 10 years of friendship for pussy and got away scot-free. She still won't talk to me, but all I want in the world is to comfort her...and kick his ass all up and down campus.

UPDAT// Still suicidal. Ex won't talk to me. I've cut all ties to anyone who knows both of us. They've chosen their side, unfortunately they've chosen the wrong side. They could easily fix this situation by showing her how wrong she is, but they'd rather preserve the 'peace' they've come to know and cherish.

I have no friend and tons of free time to do nothing, because I have to save the money from my two jobs.
The only reason I'm still alive is because I can't imagine what it would be like to lose a child and I'm too fucking worried that my mother would follow me. I am leaving my home town forever because it's been tarnished by everything I've been through. 
I'm terrified, though. If I move only to find that my new town is as bad or even worse than the one I left behind, I honestly don't think I could survive it. Please, God, if you exist, make this work for me. I've worked too hard and suffered too much for this not to work out.

regarding one person. How do I react?",Gravy_Lockdown,76,16,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h86q3/my_husband_has_never_kept_secrets_except_when/,"Throwaway account here.

28/female and the husband is my age. We've been married for a little under a year now and have always had great communication except regarding one person - a long time female friend of his.

To tell you a little about myself first, I am a ""worst case scenario"" type of person. This is due to the fact that my past relationships were flooded with my SO's lying to me and cheating on me. I have severe trust issues and I have been trying so hard to let them go. I was also raised by a family who does not believe that males and females, once married, should spend time alone together with another of the opposite sex, unless they could completely trust one another and kept no secrets.  I've always been okay with that and have no problem with (I have no desire to) spend one on one time when other men. That's just me.

My husband is a very sweet guy and very passionate towards me. I have no doubt in my mind that he loves me and wouldn't intentionally hurt me. I know that he is a jealous guy, because he has asked me questions regarding any man I speak to on the phone or text (I don't have long conversations with other men, mostly work related).

Anyways, my husband and I started spending time with his lady friend. I was okay with it, until they started spending some time together when I wasn't around. I let my husband know this immediately, and he said that he would stop. Well, it got to the point to where they would get drunk and start disrespecting me to my face. According to my husband, it wasn't intentional(he doesn't even remember it with how smashed they were). By disrespecting me, I mean she was insulting me and my beliefs and he was attacking me with her. This pretty much blew it for me. I was hurt and humiliated...and *sober*. I continued to try to put up with her, until she started spamming me on FB with insults. AWFUL insults. I cut her off and told him *no more*. He always takes her side in debates, even though prior to any debates, he tells me one thing and suddenly agrees with her later. Yes, it makes me jealous. I feel like a third wheel. I just wish he would stand up for me and stop being a hypocrite when it comes to her.


Our relationship had never been better and was dramatically improving during this time off from her. 

A year and some months later and I receive a random novel in facebook full of apologies and what not from her. I am a forgiving person, and I know my husband needs friend. I called him and told him about it, and said that I would give it a chance, but laid down some rules. I told him I was not prepared for them to be spending time alone together or anything of the likes. I knew it would just flip me out. She totally disrespected me in the past, WITH HIM, and he never stood up for me once to her. That hurt more than anything. I wasn't about to let what we've worked for be destroyed.

Okay, I know this is horrible and wrong, but my paranoia led me to snooping. I'm sorry. So, I've been gritting my teeth and I see them having conversations online. I know they call and text each other. It's driving me insane inside and I have no idea how to react. He set up plans to meet with her, but after I asked him about what he was planning on doing for the day, he got paranoid and I guess it never happened. He never mentioned the plans he had made with her. I also call him every day on my way home from work, this is the relief for the hour and a half drive I have to make. Well, yesterday, he said he had to go. Well okay, my snooping fucking ass had to just go and look around, and I found out he had hung up with me to take her call. I know I am guilty of so many wrong things here, and I should admit to it. But I am SO paranoid and terrified of what is going on. I work full time and he is unemployed, as is she. We only live a block away from her and I can hardly get my head straight over this. He chooses to speak to her while I am gone, sure, okay, but he keeps it a secret.

Last night we had a long debate on her FB (she debates everything). For the first time in our relationship, he actually agreed with me and not with her. I cannot tell you how good this made me feel. Not because I wanted to be right, but because I am so used to him ""siding"" with her on everything. I felt more *special* than her for once with my own husband.

Why is he being so secretive about this when he is about nothing else? Is it because he knows I would be pissed? It only makes me more angry knowing the truth and knowing that he is hiding it from me.
I gave them a chance to try again, and I am hating myself for it. 

How do I confront him? Tell him I am a nosey, paranoid, jealous freak? The secrets are just out of the norm for me, that's why I'm so concerned. Do I just need professional help?

We have been together for 10 years.  Unfortunately for both of us I have experienced serious health issues for the last 6 years that has resulted in a serious deficit in our sex life. I have a pretty severe form of arthritis... Which makes the kind of sex that we both enjoy (or used to enjoy) too painful.  In addition to the terrible joint pain and stiffness -- because of the arthritis I am also often just exhausted ALL the time. The arthritis isn't the only problem. I also have a problem with prolonged periods of menstrual activity that can go on for weeks and weeks, and have involved so much blood loss that I've had to go to hospital on more than a few occasions.  Having a period once a month is bad enough -- but it really really takes a lot out of you when this kind of thing goes on for like forever, without let up... it's horrible, and I hate it, and I feel gross, and I don't want to be close when it's going on. Also, in order to treat that problem I occasionally have to take hormone medication that also does a number on my libido.

I *want* to WANT to have sex with my husband. I love him. I find him very attractive. I have talked with my doctor about it at length...
We have tried to explore other kinds of sex...but one of the main problems is -- with so many of the health issues going on - all the time -- I just don't feel desire for it. And my husband does not want me to have sex if I am just doing it for him.. he wants me to enjoy it and be into him.

We have a very loving relationship. And he is a very sexually driven person. And I feel absolutely horrible that I am not providing him with intimacy. I feel guilt about it. Terrible guilt. 

Because of the joint pain problems, the best thing my doctor has come up with is to prescribe dilaudid in a high dose so that I can at least have sex without it hurting while we are doing it.

I guess to compound the problem.. Perhaps the sex would happen better or more often.. except that my husband understandably self-satisfies himself frequently... and more times than I can recount... when the stars align and my health issues are temporarily not an issue and I initiate sex.. many times we will start to get going -- but the problem is, he's already enjoyed himself that day, and so he takes much longer than usual to reach a climax...

I don't mind (have never minded) porn or masturbation -- but sometimes I feel like that might be part of the problem... If the sex did not take so long, I would enjoy it more -- I know I would.

Anyways -- I am ready to explore the idea of working with him at finding  somebody that he could have sex with -- that I would feel comfortable with. Is there anybody out there that has done this sort of thing for the same sorts of reasons? Has it worked? What kind of problems can I expect? Am I being stupid about making the decision to do this? What if I lose my husband because I set him up with somebody to have sex with and he decides he doesn't want me anymore?

I am open to advice and suggestions because sex is important -- and I've tried for years now to try and improve things, and so far, my best efforts really have not made things better.

When I sit down and think about it, all my friends who do have an SO never met them while they where actively seeking someone. I don't know a single person who found someone through OKcupid (your millage may vary) or some other ""actively looking for a partner"" activity. The dates I've gone on from places like that haven't really gone anywhere.

That doesn't mean I'm going to start avoiding situations where I meet other people. Meetup.com has proven to be interesting in finding interest groups and I think I'll just spend more time with my friends and my hobbies instead of hunting for somebody and hopefully that will help attract someone.

The only thing that went wrong, was well, I decided to decorate the ring box with sea shells, so I could be like ""hey, look, I found a shell"" and then when she took it, surprise her.  It was kind of dark, so she saw the two shells, with a huge space in between (the box), and thought it was a giant snail, and tried to run away before I told her to come back.

So yah, we got there, unpacked, went on a long walk on the beach (not to be cliche), I proposed, and after she realized it wasn't a snail from hell (and I asked her to marry me), she started crying, and was very happy to say yes.

So, we are happily engaged!  I'd post a picture, but I'm not sure if she's comfortable with being on reddit.

I'm 22 now and have a best friend for the last 17 years of my life. We've been through thick and thin. Have grown up together and started out adulthood together. 

Except he has been very neglectful and abusive to me psychologically throughout most of that time. Which has hindered my understanding of relationships greatly throughout my life as at many times he was my only friend (I was bullied mentally and physically a lot as a kid and teenager).

This is where I Spoil the Movie:

So here we were last Friday night 24 May watching The Hangover Part 3. The 3 of us: Him, His GirlFriend and I. When it's the near the end of the film and Chow is trying to play everything off as though it's back to normal within His and Alan's relationship. But then Alan has an epiphany and respectfully rejects Chow's friendship and the two of them go their separate ways.

Here I am sitting right next to a man watching this movie, whom I've been in the exact same situation with many times. I thought to myself if things go sour again I'm not going to give anymore chances and I think this decision will benefit me greatly but also it will be the wake up He needs in order to realize he can't keep treating people like this. 

So just now this afternoon he starts acting like a prick and I defend myself. He makes several deflections, many of which were completely left field and had nothing to do with our discussion. He couldn't man up and apologize or even acknowledge his actions. So I broke it off. I feel a great weight has been lifted and I hope I stand true to my decision.

I hope you can understand that I waited until he fucked up again to make this decision not because I'm being a pussy. But because He's been my best friend for most of my life and is indeed a large part of my life and social standing.

I'm the sole breadwinner and I resent her. Not so much because she spends money but doesn't earn it but because she's throwing her life away. She has no real passions that she pursues on her own. I'm really afraid she's so shallow that I can't have any real respect for her. She's not driven and I feel like I may be completely unfair judging her for that but what am I supposed to do if that's a turnoff for me?

We don't have any real common interests...we've tried a few things but not a concerted effort to make a common interest.  My pursuits are more intellectual and hers are more strictly fun.

Sex life is OK but not great. We have sex a couple times a week. I have lower sex drive than her, but not by much. Since we got married, she's let herself go some and I'm in better shape but nothing amazing. I am starting to become less physically attracted to her.

She's completely devoted to me...in that area I couldn't ask for much else. But she doesn't challenge me, she doesn't give me reason to grow. I believe that's what I want from a spouse; am I being naive?

I've supported her through college and other tough times...I kept thinking this isn't working...I would make calendar reminders to myself months in the future saying ""What are you still waiting for?""

I've had a few (4, I think) infatuations and it's always the same personality type...and quite different from my wife. I don't act on them and to the extent that I'm able to control my thoughts I don't believe I'm emotionally cheating.  Limerance (word of the day!) is the only effect and lasts a week or so at worst.  The only reason I bring this up is that there's a specific personality type I keep finding myself attracted to and it's not my wife's. Makes me jealous of all my friends getting married now in their late 20s/30s and clearly have more information about selecting their spouse than I had. This is my fault but it's still frustrating.

My biggest fear about leaving her is that she has nothing else. Her family is a bunch of parasites and she doesn't have a fulltime job so she can't support herself. The job part will probably change soon and I don't think I could leave her until that happens.

I know the common answer is to talk to her and try to make our marriage work.  If that's your advice then please help me with ideas about how to approach the subject. I don't think me saying ""I think you're shallow, passionless, lazy and getting fat."" is productive in the least. My thoughts aren't that callous but that's likely what she'll hear, isn't it?

I've tried more indirect approaches to these topics before and they haven't yielded results. I think if I talk to her about this it has to be very direct but I also think that will be incredibly hurtful.

Thanks for getting this far, I'd really appreciate any advice.

tldr: Got married way too early, high school sweethearts. Don't feel like I'm compatible with my devoted wife of 10 years. Feel like I would have picked someone quite different if I had waited to get married at a reasonable age. No kids. Don't think I'll be happy if I stay.


**EDIT:**

*Thanks for all the advice. I'm going to talk to her in a few days and let her know where I'm at. Not going to leave just telling her how I'm feeling right now and how long I've felt this way. Hopefully she'll have something as well so it isn't entirely one way. Maybe we can work through it.*

When we got together, each of us just got out of a relationship maybe 2 months prior. She's kept in contact with her ex, while I've essentially cut off all of mine.

I've talked to her several times that I don't really feel comfortable with her talking to him as frequently as they do. Its been the same over these 2 years. She will stop, and every couple weeks, sometimes a month or so, his name will be back up at the top of her text messages, facebook chats or phone calls.

We talk for a while and she goes to take a shower and I see that she called him and talked for about an hour and a half, ending right before I got home.

",justavg1,76,18,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/18l2kd/27f_my_insecurity_ruined_my_boyfriends_29f/,"I hope if somewhere Adam (Alias) ever finds this post and read it, I want to let him know I'm genuinely sorry. The take home lesson is - healthy love develops after we feel secure; addictive love tries to create love even though we feel frightened. 

Adam and I have met online in late 2010, and I've never quiet met anyone like Adam. It is the best friendship with a guy I have ever had, even as platonic friends. When I lost my bus card, he would borrow me his without hesitation even though he needed it, because he knew I needed it more. I would visit his work place, and we would do soda-drinking challenges, mixing Pepsi and chocolate milk together, and bet on our stomachs to chug that monster of a mix down our throats. Adam is also really good at math, he would spend hours teaching me GRE math problems even though they're so easy for him; he would quiz me on vocabularies late into the night even though it's not the most interesting thing to do on a weekday evening after work. As a foreigner moving to the Pacific Northwest for grad school alone, it was natural for me to have fell for him because with Adam, I feel safe and secure like I've never experienced before. 

After we started dating, my insecurities developed because I found out that one of his female coworker is super close to him. They would IM each other every day at work and after work, they share all their secrets and he would tell her all about me. To my horror, one day, after spending a night at his place, I logged on to his computer to check my email only to find a greeting from the coworker, asking if he's awake and ready to go to work. To me, it was terrifying because I was never close to guys as I was close to Adam. I perceived it as them being just as close as we are. My fear grew as the coworker would call him nicknames in front of me, and invite him out to movies without inviting me. Adam never agreed to going alone, but I felt like I was in competition. We would go to drawing classes, cooking classes, and nightmarket events together, and she would always stay really close to him. At first, I did not react, until one day she told me ""Adam would make a really good boyfriend, he's sensitive, and I think he's a Blue Chip (meaning he will become more valuable as time passes). Too bad he used to be fat. Would you have dated him if he were fat?"" Since then, i read into it that she is into him. I would cry over her, and ask Adam to stop contacting her or initiate talking to her because it bothers me that him and her are so close. Adam says there's nothing going on between them, and chats are just purely work-related. I believe him wholeheartedly because he is reliable and trustworthy. Still, the coworker would keep asking me about his whereabouts if he doesn't respond. It makes me shudder as images of her and him joking and laughing like best buddies lingers on my mind. We fight non-sense over the coworker at least once a week, and every time, it ends with me crying and him frustrated.  

This year marks the 2nd Valentine's Day we are together, but this year, we are doing long distance, 16 time zones away from each other. I started to panic on the day of Valentine's Day because he has not said anything yet. I haven't slept for the whole night, feeling really sick in bed, my heart is beating like drum. Then, it was Adam's time-zone for Valentine's Day. He wished me Happy Valentine's Day and didn't express much after. I felt dread in my body, thinking that he must've stopped loving me, and that he might be spending the evening with the coworker for dinner. I frantically called him on his cellphone and texted him and finally got a calm and cheery response 'hi bunny'. The mind of a me, all worked up imagining Adam smiling and laughing with her, is eating me alive. I couldn't hold back describing the details of what I imagined in my head to him, and asked him where his cellphone is, where he is at, who is he with, what he is doing. In the same dialogue, I also told him I know his feelings for me has faded, and I'm not stupid because I read from his actions. 

Adam was furious, too. He said ""I'm getting super fucking tired of this, being probed and tested everyday, being told i don't love you anymore, shit like that. I already wished you a happy valentine's day. I planned a gift with your sister...you can ask her what it is after dinner. I'm logging out. talk to you later."" Embarrassed, I found out from my sister that he has already made plans weeks before to surprise me, but the planning is a bit laborious so delays are expected. At that moment, I had no words to describe how bad I feel, only to accept that I am my own worst enemy, for all the frustration, fear, mistrust, insecurity, really comes from me. What has made me become me, is a series of childhood memories of my father's affairs, my mother's endless tears and sorrow over his affairs, and my deep mistrust towards men. Deep down, I know Adam is the best guy I will have ever meet, and this ironically feeds to fuel for my insecurity. 'What if he doesn't love me anymore?' I think to myself every single day. It is an unhealthy hell to be in, where my mind is.  

Just 10 days to my 28th birthday. I have come to understand that the ability to love the right way, is something worth working on, like a craft. For those that are not talented in love and relationships, such as myself, we need to know that if this relationship cracks, it will be because of our insecurity. Being insecure creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for whatever fear we imagine could happen.  There's a good book called ""Attached"" by Amir Levine. I recommend it to everyone who's anxious in a relationship like 20% of the population does, it teaches us how to manage our thoughts and irrational reasoning in times of extreme self-perceived stress, it also shows us how we could reduce these energy-draining negativity and create a broader awareness of the real situation at hand.  

Just 10 days to my 28th birthday. To me, the important take home lesson is - healthy love develops after we feel secure; it is like rowing across a gentle lake. Healthy love is satisfied with what we have; it comes from inside, it wants to give. On the other hand, addictive love tries to create love even though we feel frightened; it is like being swept away down a raging river. Addictive love is always looking for more or better; it comes from outside, it wants to take. Always believe in yourself, and know that we all have a chance to grow in a healthy love. The negativity and insecurity is getting tiring, it is damaging the most wonderful relationship I have had, and is taking a toll on Adam, none of which really happened overnight. I shall overcome, for myself, for this relationship, and for those who are anxious-preoccupied attachment types in adult relationships, most of all, for Adam. His patience is amazing, and I am not here to abuse his strength, I am here as a human being to love and give the right way. I hope my post makes a bit sense. Thanks for reading.

Anyway, we dated for about a year and a half: we were long distance and she was about 400 miles away, so we would see each other on breaks and such, but usually for about a week at a time.  Things were (for the most part) good as far as long distance can go. We naturally had our issues, and during the later part of the relationship something seemed off. We were getting into more and more fights (shocking, for a relationship that goes downhill), but nothing that was overly serious.  

Things seem to have steadied out, and the summer approaches.  She goes off to (boy scout) camp to work as a counselor, which I'm fine with, because I trust her, blah, blah.   We had been best friends for upwards of 7 years before we started dating, but all of a sudden, everything is really dodgy.  I would go up to visit her at camp now and then (it was only 25 miles away from my home or so, so not really a long drive), and we would hang out together, she'd come by for weekends, etc.  She made a bunch of new friends, all of them guys, which is to be expected at a boy scout camp, which is fine; I have lots of female friends and she has lots of guy friends, this is nothing strange.  But she grew more distant as the summer went along, and eventually she broke up with me.

Over IM.  So after watching a year and a half relationship basically end over IM, she didn't even break up with me, she wanted “a break”.  Lo and behold, 3 weeks later, she's dating a guy she meets at camp.  I tried to go back to being friends with her, but I'm beginning to think that was the wrong choice.  This girl meant more to me than basically anyone, we had been through a lot together and it was really difficult to feel like someone whom I cared so much about, and thought cared so much about me would have so little respect for me that this would happen.

Being the doormat that I now realize I was being, I agreed to the break.  This “break” at first was to be until the end of the summer, which is sketchy enough in and of itself, then extended until we finished college, and so on over the course of these few weeks.  She uninvited me to her brother's wedding, which I understood, and said that her brother “put A (her current boyfriend) to replace my spot”.  She initially told me that she was going to go to her brother's wedding alone, but I suspected something was up when I realized that it was A that she was going with; they had become very friendly over the course of the summer and would hang out together regularly after we had broken up.  Lo and behold, after the wedding, my ex is in a brand new relationship.  This was less than a month after we had broken up.  Her and the friend she met at camp went on their first date around three weeks after she broke up with me, and I'm more or less sure she broke up with me for him.  Whatever.

So after all of that, I tried to take some space from her, ignored her texts, deleted her from facebook, hit the gym, all that HILARIOUS joke, and tried to make some progress.  She wouldn't let it go.  I told her to leave me alone; I didn't want to hear from her for a while, I needed space, more or less blamed her for the breakup and our subsequent falling out.  A lot of lies and disrespect were thrown out on her part, and I didn't want to be a part of it.  I wanted to see if I could take the time to recover, and start to forgive her and someday in the (likely distant) future be friends again.

However, she won't leave me alone.  She texted me regularly, asking whether or not we'd ever be friends; asked if it was worth her hoping that we'd ever be friends again.  For a good while I ignored her, and started making progress.  I had a conversation here and there that was regularly friendly, until it became too much, I asked for space, and she wouldn't give it to me again.  This would regular get us into yelling matches where she would claim that I was being cruel to her, and me telling her that it was her fault for destroying a friendship that was pretty (really) awesome, and from my viewpoint, it was.  She refused to end the relationship in person, which was a promise that we had made to each other very early in the relationship.  She told me that she wasn't breaking up with me for someone else, I even directly asked her if the “break” we were on was a facilitation of us breaking up, and that if it was the case that she might as well call it permanent then and there, she didn't.  She told me she didn't want to be in a relationship, and needed to find herself, and that the long distance was killing her.  Well, this is a long distance relationship that she's in, again.  

But then it gets interesting.  Throughout the period of time that we dated, she regularly had “kidney problems.”  She claimed that her kidneys were kind of messed up, and that she spent time in the hospital in high school and in a coma.  However, she was never on any type of medication, asked me to keep quiet about it, and said “don't bring it up to my mother, it makes her really upset” and to avoid the topic around family because they “Don't talk about it.”  She never had any serious issues when we were both home (We live a town away from each other), or when I was visiting her.  It was always when we were apart, she would go to the hospital, the doctors would work some gypsy magic on her, and she'd be sent home with no medication or anything; she said the doctors never knew what was wrong with her kidneys, just that they didn't work right sometimes.  

I got a text from her a couple of weeks ago, asking if she thinks she made the right choice; she claims that she has decided to refuse all treatment from doctors.  According to her, she was told she now has two months to live, and has been texting me on a very regular basis, more or less trying to get me to talk to her again, and to work things out.  However, she hasn't come around in a tone that wants to make peace; she comes off in a tone that says “Hurry the fuck up and forgive me, I'm dying, so I deserve to be forgiven.”  The problem is, after everything that has happened that I've written here (there are other examples, too of really shady claims and lies) that I don't trust a word she says.  I am by no means a psychologist, but she comes off as a pathological liar, and I'm not letting myself get emotionally invested with this whole scenario.  I feel awful, but I straight up do not believe her when she says that she is dying.

This puts me in a REALLY awkward position; this is the girl that was my best friend for almost a decade.  That's nearly half my life, and my entire adult life, to be sure.  I really want her to not be mortally ill, but at the same time I find it impossible to trust her after the barrage of lies and betrayal she put me through.  I did what may or may not be a mistake, I texted her mother saying that I hope everything is okay, that the rest of the family is doing well, and that I heard about my ex's plight, and offered that if there were anything I could do, that I would be there.  I was hoping that if it was a real sickness that I'd at least get to offer my support to her family (whom I still care about a great deal; they are incredible people even if I do not speak with them or keep in touch, we grew pretty close through my ex and my friendship and dating time), and if it wasn't real that I'd get a “what the hell are you talking about?” response from her mother.  Both of these were terrifying to me, because if it's real, then someone who was so important to me is dying, but if it isn't, then she needs some serious psychological help.

So at this point, I'm not sure.  I'm not ready to forgive her for betraying and disrespecting me after going back on so many promises that I found so important, but at the same time I don't want to have the potential to leave the last words we had with each other to be negative and angry, and leave me with bitter memories of her.

At this point, I'm honestly not sure what advice I'm asking for, here.  Maybe I'm just looking for a soundboard to bounce ideas off of, but what do you guys think?  Based off of the granted, marginal information and context provided, does it sound like the truth?  I know I would know her better than anyone else, but I don't feel like burdening friends or family with more of my frustrations about the situations, and so I turn to the almighty Reddit, king of relationships.

EDIT: Breakup was last summer (July 2012), and while I was a wreck for a while, I don't dwell and get angry and sad the way I used to, anymore.  The relationship is over, and I'm fine with that, this is not a ""woe is me I still miss her and don't want it to be over if she dies blah blah omg halp i laub her"" kind of thing.

TL;DR: Best friends of 8 years, dated for a year and a half.  Messy, messy breakup full of lies, ex says she has two months to live due to a kidney problem she told me not to talk to her family and friends about and has never taken any medication for.  Not sure whether or not I should believe her.  And if it does turn out to be true, how I should even hope to handle the situation.

Also; sorry if this story sounds disjointed and clusterfucked.  I kind of wrote this in one stream of consciousness sitdown.


EDIT: Short update, it seems that the uh...popular choice is to call her parents.  I was leaning towards this idea, and I'm really glad that it seems to be the popular consensus.  I was afraid of calling and basically coming off as saying that she was a liar were it true, but I guess that doesn't really matter.  I have class right now, and unfortunately have to run and do a couple of errands before I get home, but when I do I'll call her mother and give you guys an update should I have a conversation with her.  Thanks a lot for all of the suggestion (not a typo), you guys rule; a bro fist AND  high five for all of you.  That's right, not just one, both.

We both finished college last spring.  I gained the ""freshman 15"" gradually over the course of 4 years.  So I now weigh about 20 lbs more than I did when we started dating. I have a BMI of 23, and go to the gym an average of 3 times a week, usually with him. 
Last night, while in the process of intercourse, he stopped moving and said he was not in the mood.  We untangled and rolled to our respective sides of the bed.  Ten minutes later, he asks if I'm still awake.  I was, and he asked if we could go to the gym the next day. 

In the morning, after some pressing, he admits that he's feeling ""less and less"" physically attracted to me, and the weight gain is the issue. 

Where do we go from here?  Do I starve myself to get back the figure I had in high school (which would probably require going off  hormonal birth control), do I tell him thanks for the memories, I'm off to find someone less shallow? Or somewhere in between? 

Any advice or suggestions/commiserations would be welcome. 

UPDATE: I dont think he has read this.  This morning I got a ""good morning beautiful,"" and later a text that started with ""hello lovely,"" both phrases I havent heard in 3 months or more.

My Fiancee made out with another guy several weeks ago. Her heart was split between Me and the possibility that there is someone better out there for her. We tried to work it out for 2-3 weeks but the curiosity i guess it too strong for her. I needed her to make a decision because she continued to see him after I expressed my desire to take some time away from him so she can really thing things through.

We are both our first serious relationships and i feel she just hasn't had the experience with other people to assess if I am ""the one."" 

I am probably still in shock because I feel the sinking feeling but im trying to continue my day per usual to keep my mind occupied but that only goes so far. How do I clear my mind after a 7 year relationship when pretty much everything reminds me of her. The walls of my house bring back memories, looking at the sky brings back the meteor showers we used to wake up and watch. I cant throw out the sky. 

Edit: I just want to thank you all for your thoughtful and caring messages, I posted once before, after the cheating but before the break up and people were saying really awful things towards her that did not contribute at all to helping or advising. It really hurt to read them bashing the person responsible for the best 7 years years of my life so far. Thanks and keep the advice coming.

He never used any verbal abuse on me, but lately he has been insulting and humiliating me. He keeps forcing me to sleep with him, while I don't want to (I'm fed up). Then afterwards he'll tell me I'm a slut, and lured him into it, things like that. It repeats like that everytime. He's also convinced that I've been cheating on him. It's crazy because I would never do that kind of thing, not for myself, and also because I have always been afraid of him. Because I know, if I ever did such a thing and he would find out, things like this would happen. 

The worst thing is?
I am still in love with him. I try to talk with him sometimes, to comfort him. It never works, he only gets the more angry.

I told him I was planning to leave him but I don't know how to REALLY escape. My mind is telling me that this situation has gotten out of hand and this will never be a healthy relationship, because of the way he is, and this side that he has shown (what he is capable of!!) but my heart is telling me otherwise.

Fidelity was always very important to us.

The day before yesterday she went to a work dinner while I went for some beers with a friend of mine. She did not come home, so I assumed that she slept at a friends place. When she finally called me, she immediately confessed, that she slept in the flat of a guy. She says that she was extremely drunk. She did not have sex with home (just Non-penetrative sex) and did not kiss him. The guy is not someone she knows.

I took away the engagement ring from her and told her, that I am extremely hurt and that I don't know whether I will be able to live with that. She was crying telling me that she feels like a whore and that she never would have done that by intention and that she wants to be with me (she even didn't try to lie about this night). So I told her that I think about it but may be I want her to look for a new flat.

Now I don't know what to do. I feel humiliated and my feelings are a mix between big anger and teariness. I think I still love her. She supported me financially during my studies (she nearly paid for everything with her income as a nurse), she never lied to me and may be a one-off could be excused.

I have slept with three people, he has slept with one (me.) This bothers him. He feels like he is missing out on things that some people value highly. Because we both agree that we have strong long term potential, we wouldn't want this problem to come up down the line. Consequently, we discussed the possibility of an open relationship. 

He is adamant that he would be the only one to go out and sleep with other women, whereas I would not, considering that I don't feel the same longing to sew my seed and what not. If I were to sleep with other people, it would be for revenge and fairness. He is also insistent that he does not want to break up, but wants to stay together considering we love each other and are attending grad school together--&gt;long term potential.

I am okay (I think) with him sleeping with other women, but I feel like this is an unfair system. 

Has anyone had experience with something similar? Did it work out? Would he get this need to boink everything with boobs out of his system, or is this a lifelong thing with which people generally struggle? (I know, generalizations are bad,) 

Thanks!

The love of my life wants to sleep with other women. halp!

I have my friends from home that I grew up with. Known 2 of them since grade school and added the others around high school. Their houses are like second homes to me, and from the ages of 6 to 19, I spent almost every day with them. The thing is, I'm the ""quiet"" one. My friends are talkative, social people, and I tend to be more reserved. I enjoyed going out and socializing, but I was never the one making all the plans. My friends would always talk to a million people and do that, and I'd go along with them. Just always how things have been.

But then we all went away to different colleges, and I was forced to make new friends. I ended up with friends that are a little less outgoing. They're more like me (laid back), and I soon realized that things would be different. If I wanted to go out a party, I couldn't rely on my friends anymore (like I had at home), because no one would be making plans. In my friend group at school, I became the ""go to"" guy. I was the guy that knew of the good concerts, the good parties, and who could be counted on for a good story at the end of the night. I'm not really sure how that happened. My best guess is that I was kind of selfish about my friendships. I recognized that a lot of the time, my friends weren't doing the kinds of things I wanted to be doing, so I made my own plans. I invited them to come along, but I would just go off and do what I wanted to do. 

Now I've graduated and I'm back home with my childhood friends, and I've reverted back to my old role. I'm not really sure why, and I'm not sure I like it.

In the sense that we've known each other forever, so I don't want to ""ditch"" them by making my own plans, like I would with my school friends. Or maybe it's because I've established my personality over the last 16 years with these guys, and I don't want it to seem like I'm a different person. All I know is that I'm more conscious of what my home friends think of me, so I'm less likely to ""break the mold"" I've set for myself.

1310375976.0,60,self.relationship_advice,ima89,[Ex]-Fiancee broke up with me via email while I'm 4000 miles from home on business.,shuffled,68,8,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ima89/exfiancee_broke_up_with_me_via_email_while_im/,"This is my first post on Reddit, I've got a few comments under my belt, but go easy on me.

The title is just the surface of this, and naturally there will be certain parts that no matter how much I rewrite it, will probably never make any sense to anyone.  This is something I have to get some perspective on because I'm a disaster, and if it were not for my obligation to finish my job here, I would have probably booked a flight home already.

Me: **M24** (Birthday in 5 days, Happy Birthday to me)

Her: **F25** (Close to 26)

We: Mortgage on a house in both our names, I'm a successful person in IT, and she's a successful Dental Hygienist going through school for HR and Finance, have a year and a half old dog, 2 cats, we try to enjoy life through all the ups and downs it has given us.

I found out a month and a half ago that I was needed by my job to travel to Belgium for work for 25ish days beginning July 1st.  This would be my longest trip away from her since we began seeing each other and living together.  Of course this was met with some tough feelings of her thinking I was abandoning her there, etc.  I got through those and made arrangements for my job to pay her flight here and back.  

She was expected to arrive Friday, July 15th in Paris, where I would be driving from Belgium to pick her up from the airport and spending 3 days in Paris before coming back to the town where I work in and enjoying some local things before we would fly back home together.

She is French, from Quebec City, Quebec, she started learning English close to 6 years ago, and she's really good for someone who speaks french all day at work, and only outside work does she encounter English, but we still have our spats due to a language barrier (I am having to re-learn french as I knew it when I was younger but we moved to an English only area and lost most of it).  She went to visit Quebec city on Saturday and Sunday with one of her co-workers(female) who had never seen the city.  It's a beautiful place, we've been there a few times together in the last year to enjoy the scenery and get away from our lives for a few days.  I'm not sure what happened on that trip to the city, and from here is where I'm completely lost.

I received her email this morning at around 4:30am, because of the time difference I have made an effort to roll over and check my phone in case she's just going to bed as I'm groggy and we can have a good night conversation.  Well this wasn't exactly the groggy wake up call I wanted, and I proceeded to try to Skype the house phone and her cell phone to try to see what triggered her to send the email.  Obviously someone who lacks the guts to tell me to my face, either on the phone or over Skype in this situation will not have the guts to pick up the phone to speak to me directly.  I would have installed skype on her computer, however before I left she disagreed and told me she would see me in Paris at the airport when I picked her up.  I questioned it but dropped it afterwards.

Her email brings up past things that she has told me.  Specifically in the family department.  I do not want children, she has known this since very close to day 1 of us starting to date.  (The reason being that my dad re-married a woman who is much younger than him, and had children when I was 15 and up, they had 4 kids, and I've raised my brothers and felt that I didn't want to live that way)  She has never had a problem with this, in fact, she always told me that she didn't want kids either, and she wanted to be able to enjoy her life to the fullest, financially and time wise.  Now her email is saying that she won't be coming to Belgium because she doesn't want to come and pretend things are fine, she wants kids and I don't want kids(My opinion hasn't wavered since we first started to date, but after this email, I'm beginning to think I'm a selfish asshole for not wanting kids at all).  She claims that I'm not happy and she's not happy and there's someone else out there that can treat me better.  

I've been gone for 2 weeks, and all of a sudden after a single weekend trip to her home city she decides that she doesn't want to be with me, and would instead be with her friends that she knew in high school (I'm guessing they live a life now that I can't have in some way?) and she doesn't like the city we live in at all.

I'm at a complete loss.  I don't really know what happened in Quebec City.  I obviously don't know the whole truth of the trip if she saw all her friends and they instantly made her want to leave me.

I do not plan on stopping her from leaving me, I am not planning on begging her to come to Europe to try to ""fix"" anything.  Sometimes I am very logical, and I know that relationships are not logical at all, and I've tried to put myself into her shoes, but I can't throw away the relationship just to move back ""home"".  I'm not where I came from either, I came from farm land and 15 miles till the nearest small town.

Any help / advice / insight is appreciated, I may add more into this when I've got a clearer mind, but for now, I'm 4000 Miles away from anyone I know on a real personal level and I need some guidance.

She, my girlfriend of 6ish months, was helping set up a party that I was going to eventually (I don't want to say too much, but this party didn't start until a specific time, so she was in and out of the party house while I waited outside with some friends). So I didn't see her much over the course of the evening. When I did see her, she seemed to be fine, drunk-wise, and was running around doing stuff and generally being busy. There was a gap of around three hours, and then suddenly I realize I've just seen her rip her shirt off and run backstage (right, so there was a show going on too). Um, OK.

So I tried to find her, because obviously something had happened in the last 3 hours that caused her to go wacko (I was thinking tons of alcohol), but couldn't for about 20 minutes, until after the show ended. When I did finally get to her, she had her pants halfway down her ankles, shirt still off, and was pulling away from an obviously intense makeout session (eg her neck was laced with purple) with a girl that was (in case you missed this detail) not me, nor anyone I had ever met. She then looked at me for a second and then asked if I wanted a threesome with said girl.

Wat.

I looked at her for about five seconds before ascertaining that she was A) drunk as fuck, and B) completely serious. In fact, she took the both of us into a spare room backstage and started lying down on the fucking floor and loosening her pants again right then and there. 

So back up. This whole situation came as a great shock to me because neither of us have ever had polyamorous inclinations -- or at least, have never voiced any to each other. Furthermore, we've never discussed the ins and outs of initiating sexual contact with other people, but I had (and I think rightly) assumed there would be none. So I'm way fucking floored.

I went along with it for a little while, because I'm a heterosexual male and what the hell, these things only fall into your lap occasionally. But I really couldn't do anything at all beyond a couple of kisses with the strange girl. My girlfriend's pants stayed on, and that was that, because the feeling really started to well up in me that -- fuck, I've just completely been had by my girlfriend. She drunkenly made out/did whatever else with a random person that was not me for an undetermined period of time, and then tried to get me involved into this situation as well. I told her I wanted to leave, both because I felt weird and because she was too drunk to be doing something like this, and she consented, though not without resistance.

So that's what's up. I have no idea what to think or feel about this situation. Part of me is really offended and betrayed that she did something so overtly sexual with a stranger, and part of me thinks this is a result of us not properly addressing this hypothetical situation, or that she was being a cool girlfriend, or something. And part of me is a little disappointed I turned down the opportunity at all. She said (again, before she passed flat out because she was horrendously drunk) that she was really sorry and feels like a ""shithead"" and that it won't happen again. But I don't know whether to believe her. 

Annnnd, so yeah. I don't even know what advice I'm looking for. I guess, can anyone tell me what the fuck happened here? And how big a deal should I make it moving forward?

I've also never been laid, never had a girlfriend, and can count the number of girls I've kissed on one hand.

I'm not the most outgoing person, but I'm not completely socially inept either.. I have a lot of friends, go out to bars, go to parties, generally do everything other young people do, yet I'm the only one who has never met someone. I even tried a dating site a while back and got 3 responses to messages. 3 responses in 6 months. Of those I only went out with 1 more than once.

At this point I just don't know why I should care anymore... I don't just want someone to fuck, and I don't want to get married tomorrow. I just want to meet someone who is interested in me and I can spend time with, I don't think that's too much to ask.

I guess the point is I don't want to hear any more flaccid reassurances that I'm a ""good catch"" and ""someone will come along"", I want to know if anyone out there feels as hopeless as I do at this point. (Also venting my frustrations feels good, don't really have any friends who I could say this sort of thing to without being called ""emo"" and getting laughed at)

Thanks for listening random people of Reddit.

[Edit: Thanks for all the words of encouragement and suggestions everyone, I've started to think about some things differently after reading your replies and I hope the first step to enjoying life more is just going about it from a new angle.

I had met a wonderful woman at work who was in a very abusive (physical and emotional) relationship. This woman reached out to me but was very afraid to do much beyond talk and, without much courage within her, she cried to me to do something. 

Which is where my question to you came in: I had asked if I did the right thing by offering her a place to stay but backing off and letting her make her own decision. 

I decided to let it be hers. 

She came to me, and a few other co-workers and friends, and together, we put plan to get her out safely and make her disappear without a trace. She changed her bank accounts, phone humbers, deleted anybody she didnt trust on facebook and then changed her name on the site, and came and lived with me. 

For the first month she was quiet. She obviously still had strong feelings for me, but was afraid. 

I waited patiently, only caring for her. 

Now, we're in love - and I dare say this is it. She and I are moving to another state soon to live near her family and plan our own. I plan on asking her to marry me on the 4th of July under a cloud of exploding fireworks. 

So thank you RA.

1260569434.0,58,self.relationship_advice,adqq9,How Not To Conduct a Relationship: A cautionary tale,,65,7,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/adqq9/how_not_to_conduct_a_relationship_a_cautionary/,"First, although I'm not sure it's actually relevant, I'm a 32-year-old female.

Secondly, I am currently ""on a break"" from an off-and-on six-year relationship. He's 30, and almost completely blameless. 

Briefly, when we began dating, I was a 26-year-old with a fantastic job that brought me both a sense of fulfillment and a nice salary. In addition, I was about to embark on a solo trip to Germany to spend a month with friends I made through my university's exchange program (including a German man I was in a relationship with until I met my current boyfriend; the German confessed to me that he met a girl closer to home, too, so we ended our involvement mutually and amicably). I had so much going on in my life at that time that I felt good about, that I didn't feel I needed a partner. The physical contact and companionship were great, but not something I was focused on. I left for Germany after this guy and I -- we'll call him D -- had been seeing each other for a month. I came back a month later, and he was so enamored with me that he formally asked me to be his girlfriend. As in, he took me to dinner, took my hand in his, and said, ""Would you be my girl?"" I had never had that happen before, and the gesture was off the charts in terms of its romanticism. Finally, I was experiencing the kind of love I no longer believed existed.

About three months later, the unexpected happened: I lost my job. I had been in my position for seven years by that point, which started out as an unpaid internship and progressed rather quickly to my running the department after I had seriously impressed the owners of the company. Because I had focused so much on my career, the job loss was devastating to me. For as long as I live, I will never forget how hollow I felt as my boss told me he was going to have to let me go. He sent me on my merry way with a mere two weeks' salary and a letter of reference. I lost it. D was right there, and he did everything a fantastic boyfriend would do to cheer me up. I gave myself a day to grieve and then hit the pavement. Everything I applied to, I was turned down for. The first week, I had four interviews. Then two the following week. Then one. Then none. Fast forward another three months and I lost everything I owned. Apartment, car, furniture... all of it. In four months' time, my world was turned upside down. I moved back in with my mother and had to face the tumultuous relationship with her I had avoided for many years by that point. 

I'm giving a lot of information here, and I should probably zoom out a bit. In the interest of brevity (too late), I'll say that it took me eight months from the time I was let go to find a crappy stop-gap job that paid me less than half of what I was making before. My debts accumulated, my credit score plunged, and I was utterly and completely without a way out of the hole I found myself in. I moved in with D at that point, but by then, I had become an entirely different person than the dynamic girl he had fallen in love with: I was fixated, utterly and completely, on him and our relationship. Where I had once simply enjoyed his presence in my life, I now *needed* him, and when he wasn't right there, I freaked the fuck out. Almost immediately, the pressure became too much for him, and I ended up back at my mother's (after a brief stint in a mental institution following a total breakdown). We didn't speak for a few months, and I eventually began dating other people. D was there to listen to me as I told him about the guy who showed up to our date and proceeded to tell me all the ways he'd like to defile Britney Spears, and the other guy who strung me along for several weeks before admitting that I was his ""side project."" Many months later, D and I were back together, but the damage had been done: I had a crappy, low-paying job, no ability to return to or pay for school, nothing else in my life from which I could derive even the most remote sense of satisfaction, and the moment we were together again, he became my world. 

This cycle would repeat itself a few times. I eventually got back into my own place, but it was too expensive for me. There were entire weeks I wouldn't have eaten if not for D. My father died recently and it affected me deeply; of my two parents, even though my father was two states away, I had the vastly less dysfunctional relationship with him. I repaid D for his kindness by fixating on the mistakes he made, no matter how big or small, rather than by appreciating him for all the wonderful things he did for me. And most recently, I had become consumed by the kind of jealousy I had only heard about from my guy friends whose girlfriends were utter psychos. Any female he talked to heralded the imminent end of our relationship; they were young, fun, attractive, and going places... all things I could no longer claim for myself. In my struggle to be his number one, I lost sight of myself, and became someone with whom he always felt on edge. His every move was under constant scrutiny as I looked for signs that he was about to leave me. On some level, I knew I brought nothing to the table, yet that wasn't enough to knock some sense into myself. And although he may not yet have left for good, I have to face the possibility that maybe he has. It destroys me, because we had some amazing times together, and I have dated enough to know that he's rare... but I know I have only myself to blame if this is truly the end.

Even as I sit and think of the things he did that weren't exactly helpful, I have to believe that if I had brushed myself off and continued being the focused, personally satisfied individual he met, I wouldn't be writing this. I've been so content to believe all this time that he caused these reactions in me, when it was really the other way around. 

Today, I registered for classes. It's the first time I've been back in school since before we met, and the act of paying off my old debt to the university and signing off on the classes I needed brought about a feeling I haven't felt in years: pride. I was proud of myself for taking this step, and it suddenly doesn't matter if he's surrounded by adorable college-aged girls anymore. I had an idea that it would do this for me, but I really didn't know for sure until I actually made the move. But as I picked up my cell phone to call him and share the good news, I stopped myself: we're not speaking at the moment. At least for a few weeks, maybe for good. I did send him a short email, but I immediately regretted it. I deserve what I'm getting right now and I know it. Still, knowing he's proud of me is important, and I'm having trouble deciding whether that's a good thing. I think it is; who among us doesn't like knowing we're special to someone? 

**Here's the tl;dr**: If you have love, honor it. Honor it by loving yourself. It's bandied about quite a bit, the old saying that you can't love anyone until you love yourself, but it's absolutely true. So for those of you who are smothering your significant other because of an underlying lack of personal satisfaction (and you know who you are), take a step back. Take stock of what is important to *you*, create fulfillment for yourself, and then enjoy your relationship for the ways it enhances your life. And for those of you who are being smothered, show your significant other this post. There's not much I wouldn't do right now to tell my boyfriend how sorry I am, but I have to sit quietly with this for a while and let my actions sink in. I had love, and I killed it.

They had dinner and then she called me and said they were going to go play a couple games of pool; this was at 9:20.  I know she was there the whole time with him because she ran into a good friend of mine from high school and they verified they were there.  She ended up not showing up at home until 12:30, and i was super pissed by this time.

I ended up confronting her when she got home and told her I knew that she had been texting him so much the past week and what was going on yadda yadda yadda... She swears that it was just a friendship, that she thinks they could be really good friends down the road, and that there were no sexual feelings or anything like that.  I told her it was wrong for a married woman to start making best friends with the opposite sex at this stage in their life.  she has a husband and a child yet she wants to put herself in this situation that could lead to something else down the road.  I told her how I felt about all of it, and she said that she didn't know what would happen the next he came into town if he wanted to go out again, because he was a friend and she didn't want to hurt his feelings.  I told her she was putting his feelings above mine and that if this were the other way around she would be shitting a brick, then beating me with said brick.  I gave her a scenario if it was me and she didn't like it one bit, so I said yeah that's me right now... It just seems like she wants this friendship to work because maybe it will lead to something later on and that's what she wants.  She told me she can talk to him and have convos with him that we don't have... (Ex: her and I talk about parenting and that kind of stuff, whereas she can talk to him about her life growing up (i already know about her growing up), work stuff that I wouldn't understand)   and that it's just nice to have that conversation, which that scares me too.

She told me she didn't technically lie about texting him because I straight up never asked her who she was texting, always gave me some type of excuse like i just didn't pry enough.. i told her i'm not the over zealous husband who has to know who you are texting all the time because that's your business, but the way she went about it, texting at all hours of the night, keeping her phone on silent when she never did... that crap... 

help me out here guys, am I right with the whole people at this stage in life don't need new best friends of the opposite sex because it puts them in bad situations or am I overreacting?? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a throw away account obviously, but let me just state what is happening...

Last week my wife went to California on a business trip for work, and I went with her.  On Wednesday she met a new service tech that would be handling her area of work in Texas.  The class she was attending had a big dinner that night for everyone, which I attended with her.  The service tech was there but had to leave early to catch a plane, but she kept texting someone the whole night we were having dinner and ignoring me.  When we got back to the hotel she was talking at the bar with some girls from her class and I got her phone out while i was in the room and read the texts.  Basically just flirting and nice to meet you crap, blah blah blah... The rest of the trip she stayed on her phone texting him, I know this because i looked at the phone records and all day Friday, Saturday and Sunday were texts sent to and from him!  Her phone is always on silent now, which it didn't used to be, she doesn't go ANYWHERE without her phone so I can't look at the messages. She also set up a private GoSMS box for his number, I'm sure of this because she had an email from GOSMS about her private box password that she didn't delete.

When I ask her who she is texting she will give me some person she works with, then I will look the next day on AT&amp;T and she didn't text that person at all that day. So she is lying about who she is talking to.  Randomly she will bring his name up, and act like she never talks to him/doesn't know him at all.  He is coming into town today (lives about 2 hrs away) to introduce himself to her work as the new service tech for a machine and wants to take her out to dinner tonight (business, or so she says) since she is the coordinator of this machine.  I expressed my concern to her last night that I was worried about tonight, but she insured me I had nothing to worry about...I didn't tell her I knew she was texting him non stop all weekend and calling him, but she still made it sound like she didn't know him, and the dinner was going to be awkward but I find that hard to believe since she probably knows him pretty well by now by all the texts.

The restaurant they are going to I have a friend that is a server there.  I'm going to get in contact with him today and see if he will do some surveillance for me and let me know when they leave so I can see if she is going anywhere with him afterwards. I also set up the family link on On*star today so I could track her car.... Do you think I have anything to be worried/am I going to far?? anyone have similar type of stuff happen, and what did you do?  Also we have an 11 month old together, which makes things harder.  I have told her if she ever cheats I will leave her regardless of family.

I asked him to leave my home, but the family wants us to reconcile.",PleaseStopTalking80,76,15,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/199rbx/my_wife_and_i_f_and_m_both_32_have_a_cousin_m42/,"A little bit of background: my wife and I have been together 11 years, married ten. We have a lot of family close by, including ""Frank,"" a cousin who lives across the park from us. Family get togethers are often hosted at our home because we have the space and, without any kiddos, it's easy for us to organize and handle events.

Frank always attends despite the fact that he never has anything nice to say to anyone. He shows up first, starts in on how he dislikes or is against nearly everything anyone else claims to enjoy or believe in, and doesn't stop until he leaves, usually the last one out the door.

Most of the time everyone smiles and chats around him, chalking his behavior up to his own petty jealousies and insecurities but I'm tired of it in my home. Most recently, my wife and I hosted a get together to celebrate both our ten year anniversary and my niece's engagement.
Frank started out typically bitter, telling everyone who wouldn't walk away how marriage is an odd thing to ""celebrate"" because women only want to be married so they have a man ""locked up"" when their sex drive wanes. According to Frank, this happens right after women are in their late teens, early twenties. After that, no physical intimacy is normal. This we laughed off because, after a decade, my wife and I have an even better physical relationship than when we started. Frank doesn't, apparently, too bad for him but whatever.

However, then he approached our niece's fiancé and started giving him ""statistics"" on how many men cheat because of this lack of attention from their women, and how dating sites accommodate that male need, hint hint. My wife's close friend (who is also her ex, this is relevant) was catering the party, overheard this, and helped steer the bewildered and now angry fiancé out of an altercation.

This pissed Frank off so he started asking who the caterer thought he was and discovered my wife dated him before she met me, that they're still friends, and that he actually was part of our wedding party. Now Frank is loudly proclaiming to everyone at the party that ""exes are exes for a reason! They should stay that way!"" Exes are one of his favorite topics, based on (I'm sure) that none of his exes can actually stand him. He begins spouting that if exes are friends it means they're really still dating and just want to screw each other.

At this point, I escorted Frank out the front door and advised him he was not welcome back until he could conduct himself as an intelligent adult in my home. I'd be fine never seeing him again, but some of our older family members have been mentioning to us that Frank is upset over how we misinterpreted his actions and doesn't want to be excluded from important family functions. Family unity is important to them and I understand that, but I'm not okay with having this clod spouting off further.

What would be a way to handle this to accommodate my wife and I and our concerned family members? Is there a tactful way to lay ground rules that has worked for those of you in similar situations?

Keep in mind this guy is shorter than me, fat and balding, and in no way appealing before you get all ""rape culture"" on me, and I never made any seducitve attempts and whatnot. 

Now, I accidentally revealed this to a school counsellor when I was depressed at 14. I didn't know they legally had to report it to authorities. So child protection comes, I get whisked away, and both sides get questioned. He denies it adamantly and tells my mum ""the compliments (on my body, ass, tits) were to ""improve my self-esteem"" and then I apparently offered him a blow job in exchange for money. Shocking!! (By the way, I read about this defence because I read my mother's journal later which I'll come to). 

So, my dad's out of the picture, I've got no friends or support and am pretty weird  (probably why he targeted me) so I withdraw the allegations. I need their money. I hate their fucking guts, but I need their money to live because I have no one else. 

Basically, for a few years, I live in their ""reality"" AKA I made everything up for attention or some shit, or because I was jealous of my new brother. Wow, like anyone would go to that much effort. P.S. if you're familiar with the term, they're full bogans here in Australia.

Now I'm 23 and seeking justice. I refuse to live in their twisted alternate ""perfect family"" reality. Problem I need help with: my mother keeps harassing me to ""see her"" and ""bond with her"" and is bombarding me with texts. She's never acknowledged his abuse for a second.

Do I reply and go all out about the truth? What do I say? Where do I go from here in general? Should I press charges? Any advice is welcome.

So... anyway, yeah.  Even though I think 99% of everyone agrees with my husband's (Redditor= Schoogy) actions, it turned out to be a big deal to my friend. 
   

She did email him back saying ""Fine, I just won't stop by again"". 
  

To which he replied ""Thanks.""


She then sent another emailed saying (names have been changed)  "" I do hope that you also forward this to all the other culprits.. Mary, Sam, Rachel, Charles, Ali and all your friends too etc.. I always Feel unwelcome there by you.. You can never visit  with J973, Just say what you need &amp; leave.. you make that VERY clear.. She always says.. thats Just ""Schoogy""...he does that to everybody..
    Yet, I Feel I am the one Friend that helps no matter what, &amp; I do not over stay, but it is sad that I will have to contact J973 on Facebook &amp; Email to get to see her..But I will make sure that my visits are when you are not there, so I do not impede your space..Tell J973 that I send her clips for the xpen that I dropped off yesterday, in todays mail. have a great day.""


Husband replied with "" You don't have to get all butt hurt.  It's not a big deal.  Since you feel compelled to dig deeper, it's not just you having interrupted me having sex many, many times.  It's the fact that you don't let my wife speak.  You just talk and talk.  I can tell when she's on the phone with you. . . because she won't say a word for 20 minutes (I've timed it).  You go on and on about your life, barely taking a breath, never listening to her for more than a sentence, and then you leave.  That is NOT a conversation, and very selfish, and probably why I act like I can't wait for you to leave sometimes.""


So..... that is from last night and this morning.  Husband wanted to say more, but I asked him not to get too nasty or personal with it-- even though, she didn't take it well.  Like I knew she wouldn't.  


Yes, I understand that most of you will say she is a sucky person anyway and I shouldn't want to be friends with someone like that, but.... that's just me.  I am just severely loyal to a few people in my life who I know don't deserve it, but I would never say that she is not my friend.  


She has been like a second mom to me since I was 11.  She took me on my first trip to Cancun.  We have went on many trips and road trips when I was younger.  I experienced a lot of things in life with her, and she did change me for the better.   I had never probably more than 50 miles from my home except with her.  


So.... yes I am weird and dysfunctional and I have dysfunctional friends that are rude and don't get along with my husband.   I know he is right and had the right to send her the original email.   I know that she is the one escalating this.

He recently invited my bf to DP some girl.  At least my bf told me about it.  He said ""hahaha no,"" as his response.  We hang out with this guy on occasion, so I feel disrespected by this friend that he'd try to get my bf to cheat on me.  I think if I had a friend who was being that disrespectful to my boyfriend, I wouldn't hang out with them anymore.  I would at least want him to stand up for me and say something like, ""don't talk to me about that kind of stuff, I wouldn't do that.""

What's within my rights regarding feelings and actions I can take?  I really wish my bf would stop hanging out with this guy, because I think we pick up traits of the people we spend time with.  I don't like that this guy is in my life by association.  I don't associate with people like that.  The way my boyfriend handled it makes me less attracted to him, honestly.  Maybe the ""cool girlfriend"" thing to do would be to ignore it and pretend to be okay with it.  Maybe I am insecure about the relationship lately and that's why I'm overreacting.  I am okay with tough love, maybe I need to suck it up and get over it.  Apparently I have a huge ego and can't handle being disrespected like that.  Is this acceptable?

What do I do?  

Edited to add that my bf intends to remain friends with this person, just not hang out very often.  I guess my main goal is to not lose face for my bf and to handle it with dignity and so he doesn't lose respect for me.

Edited to add that he has gotten slightly physical with me twice in the last month when he was drunk.  This is probably a factor in why I'm having a hard time trusting him.  I also have dated a lot of scumbag guys, so may be a reason I am overreacting and not handling this as calmly as I like.  Does that make sense?

Ignores me, wins arguments by sheer volume, and for simple requests says no just for spite. For instance, the other day he was sitting down, had his computer open and on google, and I asked him to google something for me. Everyone in the room wanted to see it, it would have taken two seconds, tops. He said no. I said, ""Really?"" and he slammed the computer shut and snapped, ""Really."" Then he got up and turned his back to me. A couple of months ago someone gave his niece a cup that belonged to his one year old son. The niece is two. He bellows at her, ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT CUP??? GIVE ME THAT GODDAM CUP!!!"" Then he snatched it away from her. Did I mention that the little girl is two? He snaps at kids while I'm around quite a bit. Also, he posts on Facebook things about my daughter that if they happened once wouldn't bother me, but repeatedly he posts her mistakes. I don't know if she is safe with him. He's unemployed, plays Mario games a lot, while she works, cleans house and does the laundry. What do I say to her? Anything? 

Edit 1: Also, I am not sure if he is spanking their one year old child or not. It seems like he's come close a couple of times, when he's frustrated, but knows I will make a huge stink if I ever see anything physically violent.

Edit 2: I'm her mother; I don't know if that makes a difference in your advice. It seems important to mention at this point that I did leave with my three children when she was about eight years old. Her father was VERY emotionally abusive towards me and my sons, he was physically abusive to the sons, and was just becoming abusive towards her when I got the courage to leave. After we left he moved across the country (USA) and has not been close to her at all. I know this hurts her but she never really talks about it at length.

Also, her husband was violent one time in my presence. He threw something at my daughter without warning and she cried because it hit her. I thought he felt bad so a few minutes later I said, ""Poor Soandso, didn't mean to make her cry."" He said, ""What? I said I was sorry!"" About three to four minutes later, I said, ""Soandso, could you pass me my water bottle?"" He said sure and picked up my water bottle and threw it as hard as he could in the opposite direction, into the living room. I didn't know what to say or do. He certainly wasn't laughing.

Follow-up to me breaking up with my girlfriend.,tolndakoti,75,16,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vm1eg/as_promised_followup_to_me_breaking_up_with_my/,"Follow up to [original Post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/vdeac/30_mins_ago_i29m_found_out_my_girlfriend27f_is/).

First off I want to say thank you to all whom provided advice, anecdotes and comedy. I needed some form of connection and it wasn't possible to reach out to anyone else that night.

The consensus said I should just to a quiet exit. No contact to/from her. Just disappear. Perhaps grab my things while I disappear. I was going to follow this; I appreciated Reddit for the advice. But, I can't do this.

Instead I got back together with an old friend that knew both of us. She was the one whom set me up with the GF as a one night stand. The friend didn't plan on me having a full blown relationship. (more on that story if you want).

The advice she gave me was, a confrontation. I was thinking about this earlier as well. Disappearing is what she would have wanted. She doesn't like confrontation. This is why she hides. She's a coward. 

Saturday. Late afternoon. Packed her stuff from my place, the night before. I planned to meet her a few days before. She tried backing out a few mins before we're supposed to meet; I texted ""this can't wait"".

I put her things on the front porch. Walk in with 1 black empty garbage bag. She's lying on the bed woken up from her nap.

To paraphrase, I told her that She could no longer give me what I wanted any more. This relationship has ended. When this relationship begun, I knew I was going to have to give more than what you gave into this. 

""Look at me in the eyes when I talk to you.""

""I didn't expect much from you. I was happy with this because I was happy with you. However, you couldn't even give me your loyalty. I'm here to pick up my things. Your stuff is outside. You're never seeing me again.""


I got up, grabbed her pillow and blanket (they were mine and expensive). I made her give me my keys and I left. 1 min talk, max. She didn't say a single word. Couldn't even keep eye contact like a cowering child. I knew this was going to happen.

To reflect on my decision. I think I made a good one. I've only had 4 nights of restless sleep thinking about the break up. Partied hard that (last) weekend with the friends. Last night was the first night I had a good sleep. I'm really surprised how fast I'm healing. I'm actually wondering if I'm healing correctly or too fast. 

What if I'm just in denial of the pain. Maybe I can cry about this sooner or later to just let is all out and take it's course. I did feel like crying in the beginning. I don't know why tears were not dripping. I catch myself having a moment of desire to weep, but nothing came out. I tried.

Also, because of the fast healing, it concerns me a bit that, this point of story in my life may some how come back to haunt me in the future.

I think that sums up how I am right now. Thanks for reading.

She is a terrific nice-looking girl with a good job, nice family, and just doesn't think about any parts of life beyond the everyday stuff. Or, maybe she does, but never talks about it, or she could with someone else, but not with you. 

She's even slightly nerdy, and plays WoW so much that she never asks you for anything; she is the epitome of low-maintenance, low-standards, girls. You could live with her forever and she would never ask you for anything, not even real commitment, even though she's religious.

Hey Reddit...
Long time lurker here...
I've read almost all of the ""I caught my SO cheating"" posts looking for the perfect solution to resolve my new problem. But, I haven't found the right way to deal with it just yet, so hence, the reason for my post and request for some advice and ideas.

**td;lr:** Cheater in my friggin house, its the holidays, and I just want to get her out and not have to deal with the families... what is the best way forward? Should I wait for later?

Backstory:
The lady (heh) and I just moved in with each other this past month (going on 4 weeks now). The relationship is 8 mos. old. I'm 36, she is 32. And yes, we should be in adult territory here, but after you hear the rest of the backstory, it seems I completely misjudged the maturity level on this one. (I feel like a total schmuck)

So, everything was obviously peachy in our short/long distance relationship... love was in the air, sex was fantastic, marriage was being discussed, etc. We decided it was soooo good that ""hey, let's go ahead and shack up!"" ""let's try this out!"".

Well, about a week before her moving down to my house, her general intimacy level dropped to a right above freezing temperature. The kisses, the hand holding, texting and most lovey dovey-ness dried up. I immediately felt the chill in the air and began investigating the situation... I chalked it up to cold feet, stress of moving to a new city, etc. The cooler temps kept up no matter what I tried to do to relieve her fears, her stress... but, as you will later find out, it wasn't the real issue.

About a week after her moving in, and no sex at all for 2 weeks (as opposed to every moment we could do it) I began to get the real sense that something else was going on. I asked her what was wrong repeatedly, only to get the ""nothing babe"". Then, one night, she went to bed early, without so much as saying goodnight, and then on my way to the bathroom I peaked in the bedroom and heard her clickity-clacking on her phone texting someone under the covers... WTF?

The next morning I confronted her... asked her (once again) what is going on? Who were you texting? She claimed, truthfully, that it was her jackass brother in law. At the time I didn't believe her entirely because of the suspicious behavior... but, I scaled the conversation back and tried to just trust her.

So, on the same day she jumped in the shower before we were about to go out and run some errands, and of course her phone was just sitting there... I had a crappy moment of weakness and began to check her messages... yep, she was talking to her jackass brother in law and... wait who is this guy... oh shit, F, F, F, F... an entire month of flirting with some guy in her old town... I miss you's, thanks for the other nights, the breakfast you made was great... and the real kicker... joking about leading a double life with a ""hahahaha"" attached on the end of it. So evil, so callous... I felt like some one punched me in the stomach and a red rage was seething out of every pore.

I confronted her right out of the shower... told her she had to end it, discussed the real meaning of ""cheating"" (hahaha), telling her she needed to cut off all contact, to contact him once more and end it, then report back, block from FB, erase him... then it spiraled into the conversation of regaining trust, forgiveness, I love you's. Things went ok for a week as I (we) pretended all was good (and texts seem to have ended). Then issues started back up, and she never reported back on the ending of the relationship with this guy.

Fast forward to yesterday... big argument about unrelated issues, her storming out for a ""walk"". While she was out... I noticed Facebook was there on her computer... again, I couldn't help myself... I looked at her messaging, and lo-and-behold there were continued love notes to this dude.

So here we are... she doesn't know I know yet. And I'm asking you guys for advice on how to conduct the ending and eviction of this ""girl"" from my house and life. It hurts like a ton of bricks landed on my chest, but I need to save face and self-respect. As much as I want to let it all slide and want to just get her back, I know its done. The trust is gone.

The issues that make this a sticky matter are really that its (oh boy) Thanksgiving weekend with both families and she really has nowhere to go here in town.

I just want to rid her deceitful face from my view... halp.

**EDIT:** I forgot one very important question, how do I tell her I know about the FB messaging? I feel kinda dirty doing the double snoop on texting and FB... I guess it is what it is.

**EDIT 2** 

Reddit, you guys are making feel better already, THANK YOU SO MUCH… so is the beer I'm drinking right now. (don't worry, I'm just drinking 2)

So, here is the plan I am now brewing:

I will calmly confront her tonight, and tell her to pack up some of her overnight things and then to please get in her car and go spend Thanksgiving with her family. I will then tell her that on Friday, I want her to come back and start packing her stuff and to be out as soon as humanly possible. I won't mention FB messages, and if she does ask why, I will calmly tell her ""you know why"" as Ymodem-G suggested. 

Tomorrow morning, I will call her parents and respectfully inform them that I will not be coming out, and if they need to know particulars, that it is up to her to explain what ""being faithful"" means. I will then ""walk"" to my family's house, help cook, hang out, soak in the love… and walk home with a full stomach of turkey and a few good beers and pass out… dreaming of my new venture into the life of singledom… or maybe of finding that beautiful woman I can trust and who loves me back.


**EDIT 3**

Ok you rubberneckers here is the situation thus far ;)

I choked last night… yes, not good. But, I woke up this morning with such dread and self-loathing that my brain went into self-preservation mode and I basically went on auto-pilot and spewed after two really large breaths.

I calmly told her that she is going to need to leave. That it's the end of the line. She of course got defensive and asked why, I then proceeded to tell her that I know that she never ended the relationship with the guy, and that she needs to be honest to me and herself… and just end this farce.

She of course lied to my face repeatedly… and then even called the whole thing stupid… even called the guy she was flirting with stupid and meaningless. WOW.

I asked her if it was so stupid, then why did she carry it on? Why ruin this whole relationship… her reaction was to get more enraged, more defensive and too just completely lie to my face.

The FB stuff came up… I did not admit that I saw the messaging, just that I saw the dude was still her friend there and that he commented on one of her posts only 3 days ago… and she even responded in a semi-flirty manner. This proved enough that she had not ended it. So, I told her that I bet she had some messaging with him… and that if their relationship was truly done, then she could show me her FB messages… nope, wouldn't do it. I know I probably shouldn't have gotten into that, but I couldn't help it.

Anyway, right now, she is pacing around the house, randomly packing up stuff in no logical manner… I told her she needs to just make an overnight bag and go be with her family, but she doesn't want to do that… for obvious reasons. She claims she can find a place to stay tonight and she will figure it all out tomorrow…. unfortunately, I don't believe her.

I'm just sitting here biding my time till she leaves… 
I'm a bit worried about her mental state, as she does take meds for anxiety and depression and I'm worried she maybe secretly popping a bunch. So now, I'm just watching out for her safety and hoping all will be resolved soon.

We are both in our thirties, and met for the first time around Christmas. Our related parents are not close at all, in fact I don't think they've spoken in years.

We fell in love instantly, indescribably. It was an absolutely overwhelming feeling, like what I figured ""love at first sight"" would be.

It's embarrassing even to type... I finally gathered the courage to read up about it on the net and check out some discussions here on reddit. It seems that everyone's focused on the birth-defect thing. But I'm not interested in having children and neither is she. She has a daughter already from a previous marriage and I have no children.

She told me last night about her feelings and that she wants to be with me. I don't know what to do. There's such a massive taboo involved here, but it seems to be focused on the issue of procreation, which is off the table...

So, I have been with this girl for almost two years. It'll be two years on 19th. Anyways, she's been having a lot of problem at home and she's been really stressed. Every time she's feeling stressed with problems at home, we argue and we fight. Usually it's because I'm trying to calm her down by either letting her talk and trying to listen by not saying much or telling her jokes to make her smile or telling her how much I love her and how we will have better future. She always find a way to start an argument out of these things like, I'm not very supportive because I don't talk. I'm insensitive because I'm always joking around. I am lying to her about loving her and there's no future. She always make me break up with her saying that she's no good for her every time she realize what she's done. She keeps blaming herself for all the problems yet she won't stop doing that. I understand that it is her nature to do that and I learned to deal with it. But her guilt overpowered her and always telling me it'll be best if I break up with her. It's been like that for like four months now. Well, yesterday I said ok if you want to break up, let's do it and I said yes. Now, she's been calling me the entire night and I haven't pick up her calls or reply to her messages because I don't know what to do. I don't want to break up with her of course. I love her a lot. But now she's saying sorry over and over. 

What should I do?

TL:DR: As title said. What should I do?

Update: Good news guys. I talked to her yesterday. She said she wanted me to be happy and that if I break up with her, I will be able to find someone else who is better than her. She said she still loves me but because of her problems at home, she is afraid that she will drag me down with her like she's been doing. I told her that I love her and I'm willing to deal with her problems no matter what. That I will be with her in time of need. We've exchanged a lot of things in our mind that we've kept for a while now. I spent the whole day today with her and she is happy. 

It was a big misunderstanding between us. We both love each other very much and we were thinking about each other and did something that was supposed to help each other but instead, it hurt us both.

I would like to say thank you for the people who told me to pick up the phone and answer/call her. I did just that. Thank you guys. ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1376190143.0,,,True,t3_1k1ved,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1k1ved/28m_girlfriend_24f_was_under_a_lot_of_stress_and/,

The conversation began with my dad shouting at my fiance to be quiet and let him talk. He spoke to her just like he was speaking to a child, which I find very disrespectful because he is *not* her dad. She is an adult who has her own set of parents and deserves to be treated as such. I understand that my dad has every right to treat me like a child because in many ways I still am, and I will always be his son, but I am not OK with him extending that mentality towards the **woman** I have chosen to spend the rest of my life with.

I had to tell him everywhere I went, he told me where I could and couldn't shop, what I could and couldn't wear, he was ""allowed"" to tell me to go home if he didn't want me going someplace, etc. Well the worst thing was he pressured me into giving him my virginity. I had been raised in a very christian household, and the honest to God only thing I really wanted out of life was to only be with one person sexually (if you disagree, please don't criticize) and he would yell at me constantly about not sleeping with him, even though I did everything else with him (I had never done those things either, I just wanted the fighting to stop). He eventually implied that if I didn't do it, he was going to force me to.
Eventually, he cleaned himself up, he stopped yelling at me, I dont have to tell him where I'm going, I can sleep with my dog in my bed once a week now and he doesn't tell me when I have to go home, he just asks that I show him what I'm wearing before I go to the gym. It may still seem a little fucked up in some aspects, but Its so incredibly much better, and I don't cry every day now. But now he keeps telling me I'm annoying all the time... Sometimes in ways where it seems abusive again. He told me he didnt like listening to me talk about my day, purely because he ""felt like fighting"" and things like that. He just keeps acting like im suddenly annoying to him, and i'm so scared he's going to leave. If he leaves, I wont be with the only person I've done more than kissing with, and the person I lost my virginity to. It seems really messed up, but the idea of losing the person I gave everything to is giving me a panic attack and I've been thinking about just walking into traffic or something if he does leave so I dont have to deal with disappointing my parents, God and losing the one thing I wanted. I honestly want him to go back to controlling, threatening, and calling me names again, because at least then, even if I'm crying, I know he isnt actually planning on leaving. I'm so messed up and just need SOMEONE to talk to. If youre just going to tell me to leave him, please don't.

tl;dr  Emotionally abusive boyfriend straightens him self up, acts like he's debating leaving, don't know if I'm overreacting, or what to do. Gave him everything and the panic of him leaving is giving me self-harming (not necessarily suicidal though) thoughts.

1365113526.0,61,self.relationship_advice,1bowuh,[25/m] Newlywed wife (25/f) nearly destroyed marriage in a few days..wants a second chance.,albertvii,73,12,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1bowuh/25m_newlywed_wife_25f_nearly_destroyed_marriage/,"Hey people,

I'm going to post a lot of information/backstory here here so please bear with me..

I recently got married back in September, 2012, I was ecstatic to be marrying the person I ALWAYS wanted to be with. I actually knew my wife back in middle school (which was 2001-2002 at the time) and she was always a big part of my childhood growing up, after getting courage to ask her out I actually got rejected from her...3 times. I ended up finding myself to be in the 'friendzone' with her and pretty much stayed that route until after high school. We went our separate paths and didn't reconnect until 2010 (which about 4 years has past since seeing her), she had a baby girl since then and baby's daddy was a straight up psycho (been in jail numerous times, stolen cars, firearms, jewelry, sells drugs which at the time was pot, but more recently cocaine and heroin, has an anger issue and has a real grudge against me just for being in the presence of his daughter..but I didn't find this 'information' out until later in the relationship), the two of them recently split up and she wanted to start a new life with her daughter, we had a good time hanging out again and our feelings ended up coming out and she told me how she was sorry for always turning a blind eye to me in the past all these years and we kissed for the first time ever...it took me 9 years to achieve that goal, but I was happy to cross that item off my list of achievements.

There is a lot of 'filler' in between leading up to this point, but I'll bring it up if anyone is curious of what happened in between.

My wife has problems communicating, I only found this out to be an issue about a week or two before we got married, when it comes to having 'talks' to help resolve problems she would constantly find ways to avoid the talk ""I had a really rough day, I'd rather not talk about this now"", or ""I just want to start my weekend, I really don't have time for this"", or ""Can I have a few minutes of silence?""...when it came to finally talking to her after patiently waiting until it's a better time to talk (sometimes a day or two later) she'll usually respond with ""Well, what is there to talk about? I don't see what the big deal is""...this instantly got on my nerves.

She also takes personal inventory on my actions..my personal life, I'm a gamer, I like to game, when I come home from work, I'll spend time with my family for a bit, then jump on my Xbox 360 and play Black Ops II, after the first week of being married, I really started feeling like there was something wrong...like an uncomfortable feeling you would have, I'd ask my wife simple questions like ""How was your day?"" or ""How are things?"" and it'd always be the one word response ""Fine"", ""Good""..I usually take these responses as there's something wrong so I'd normally ask ""You doing OK?"" and same type of reply ""Yup"".

Of course nothing was fine, there was something wrong, and she wouldn't tell me, it continued this way for about 3 months and the entire time I was second guessing my entire actions, it really ate at me. If I spent even a half hour on my computer I'd feel judged, if I fired up my Xbox and played a few games of CoD or something else, I feel like I should be pleasing my wife somehow..if I went to a friends house even I'd feel like I'm passing opportunities to spend time with my family..this drove me nuts I felt like I wasn't doing anything right when doing this, but this WAS my life before I got married...then she blew up at me. All this time second guessing myself just got confirmed, and the entire time I constantly asked her if things were fine which she would always say ""Yup"".

This really bothered me and I started having my doubts wanting to be there, I tried to mend things and start doing damage control as she was mad at me, again, having any talks with her weren't working, she wanted to avoid them by making excuses, and when it came to me putting my foot down and saying ""Tough, this talk needs to happen"", she wanted to leave. But it didn't stop there.

As I tried making things better, things started getting uncomfortable..her mood was bad when she got home from work, I'd come home and go to kiss her, but reject me from getting any kiss, she'd give me the cold shoulder then go to her daughter and be all loving, and affectionate..I hate to be jealous of that as her daughter is only 3, but it did bother me that I never saw the affection she'd give her daughter and not me. Things only turned more from there..

She started talking about how having more kids would be a hassle and wanted me to wait another 5-10 years before having kids (this sucked because she had a kid with someone else already, and honestly, I wanted to be with someone who was all for doing this as that was why I married her, and she can't give me a straight answer that she really wanted to have kids at that point), she knew this bothered me, but she kept by her word saying she didn't want to have kids at least not for a long while.

She ended up going on Craigslist posting personal ads in the platonic section to find friends to hang out with, and the way she set up the ads seemed kinda...off...

Example: ""I want to hang out with someone other than my husband and daughter, I want to help achieve your dreams and you achieve mine, lets see what we can accomplish together""

I instantly talked to her about this since I actually found out about it, was never told (I glanced at her phone when she got a Craigslist reply back for a personals ad, this led me to start looking at her e-mail) she mentioned she was lonely and wanted to find friends to hang out with, but she refused to hang out with any of her friends on facebook or any of her other friends she already knew, she wanted 'new' friends..preferably from the internet. I told her from this point, to tell me these things before she goes and posts things online.

**Edit (Left this out in my initial post): My wife also constantly would set up plans to go out with her friends and keep me out of it** When she did go out..she'd give me weird stories of how her friends and her met some guy and the guy was so drunk they gave him a ride home and tucked him into bed, I found (again FOUND..was never told of this) pictures of her grinding with another guy (this actually happened about 3 weeks before we got married..this always bothered the heck out of me) and more recently she actually admitted she doesn't wear her wedding ring when she goes to the club..and her excuse is that she doesn't have a fun time with her friends when she has the ring on..that people ask her about her personal life and she doesn't like to talk about it, and that people don't get her free drinks when she wears it. 

When I heard this she was planning another event the following weekend, I asked her to keep the ring on, and she fought me on it..I started talking to her about the values of marriage and that the ring is a damn symbol of the whole thing and she fired a response back saying ""If you say no, I'm going to do it anyways."" At this point the loyalty disappeared. I gave her my ring and said ""If you want to go and leave the ring off, I'll leave mine off"" what was even worse of her was when I took the ring off she mentioned ""doesn't that make you feel relieved?"" ...no, it doesn't. 

I was pretty hurt, she went to the club and had her free time, I started getting drunk texts from her at 4 in the morning saying ""I miss my husband"" ""I love love love love you"", I didn't respond back.

I had problems keeping the relationship healthy at this point, I ended up finding out from a Co-worker she joined some social media websites that's specifically about hooking up with locals in your area. She never talked to me about it..and these were recently set up, like she knew what she was doing, but just proceeded to not tell me..and I wasn't proud of my marriage at this point, all I could do is complain.

Early March, I laid in bed with her next to me, non-affectionate as per the norm and was busy looking at her phone, I asked her, ""Are things okay?""

""Yup""

""You sure?""

""Yeah.""

""...are you sick of me?""

""Yes""

""Do want out of this marriage?""

""Do you?""

""Kinda, been really thinking about it""

She went silent at this point, I started explaining that things just aren't working the way I wanted it to go and that we haven't talked about things that need to be talked about and the things she recently did and fought me over, I just felt like the ideas of marriage are out the window and I'm just going to miserable from this point forward. She eventually stopped me saying that she had a headache and didn't want to talk about it and the conversation ended that night.

The biggest kicker to me didn't happen until two days after saying ""I'm thinking on leaving""...early in the morning (still sleeping in the same bed with her) an e-mail alert on my wife's phone woke me up, I went to go deactivate what I thought was her alarm, but instead found an e-mail that came from ashleymadison.com (for anyone who doesn't know what that site is, it's a website that is specifically set up to start an affair and meet with other people), she had an account and everything. I cornered her on this and she tried to defend it saying she set it up when she was with her Ex years ago, but it didn't explain that I never saw these e-mails from Ashleymadison until recently, my trust is gone at this point and that following weekend I moved all my stuff out.

At that point I talked to her parents, told her the details of what happened and briefly told her family that I'm leaving and mentioned I am sorry. Her older sister tried to give me static by saying I should work things out instead of jumping to such an extreme, but when you can't even talk to your own wife about it what can you do? (She also though counselling wasn't a good idea)

She ended up getting the divorce papers and a day before going to the courthouse to file them, she wanted to talk to me in person, I stubbornly allowed it, and she wanted to apologize for everything she's done, she suddenly had her moment of clarity when we got the divorce papers, and now she wants to work things out.

I'm currently living at my parents and she went to California to spend time with family and she ended up blowing up my phone saying that she would like to talk things through and see if I can give her a second chance, what was strange was she wanted me to give it a shot for another 6 months to a year to see if we can work it out, if not..she'll have peace to know it wouldn't work out. I didn't set any expectation but did mention back we can talk about it this weekend when she gets back. I'm faced with a huge decision on what I want to do with my life at this point forward..despite the barrage of crap that happened, I still knew her for 13 years and if I say ""no I don't want to come back"" I'm cutting ties with a friend I knew from my childhood and on top of that saying goodbye to her daughter too and will likely never see them again.

OR...I can give this whole thing a shot, but it's the fear of the unknown, will I feel miserable again? Ever since I left I actually felt more free than I did before, and this made me feel better when I started living at my parents, my wife tried to flatter me saying that I'm the best thing that's ever happened to her, and she needs me, and now she wants kids, she is willing to work out communicating, she doesn't want to go to the clubs anymore, she'll always wear her ring, and she'll remember to invite me next time she goes out. She's pretty much stated the things I wanted to have but it wasn't until NOW she mentions this.

I'd like to hear what you guys have to say about this, I apologize for the length and the backstory leading to this, this information is key as to why I'm troubled by what decision to take. I'm willing to hear any opinions or take any advice from anyone as I'll be seeing her this Saturday where I'll make my decision.

**TL;DR** - Ended up marrying somebody I had a crush on since middle school, after getting married, things weren't exactly as they seemed, I felt constantly judged and that she took inventory for things I was doing, (playing video games, or hanging with friends..even though my wife said things were fine she still blew up at me for the things I was worried about), wife liked to go online and post ads for meeting up with people, set up accounts on websites to meet with locals in our area and she wouldn't talk to me about this..I found this out. She's admitted taking off her wedding ring when going out to clubs, and more recently found an e-mail listing matches to a website that is specifically set up for the purpose on cheating with your significant other (ashleymadison.com), she's refused to talk about these issues, would constantly avoid having talks by making excuses that things are too inconvenient to be dealing with my problems, didn't see a point in counseling, and after I called the shots on divorce (and even a day before signing the papers and going to get it all finalized), she now wants a second chance.. 


Should I give her the chance or not?


**Update 1** Holy crap! Didn't expect so many responses, thank you for your insight, I found most comments helpful (and some more rude than helpful). The common majority that everyone is leaning towards is that I should leave her and move on with my life..and that's fair. I wanted to hear from a neutral party, and its good to know I'm not the only one who thinks that leaving is an appropriate route to go down.

She's willing to do counseling now, but wasn't during the times leading up to finally saying ""I want a divorce"" and I really do think her saying all these flowery things is a manipulation tactic to reel me back in..what really sucks is I've been hearing this from other people to watch out for manipulation tactics and I see them, and it's horrible when you have this idea of who this person is that you love and care about, then you see the dark evil side of this person and it shatters your whole perspective..based on your comments, it just helped confirm it more.

I'm smart enough on the kids subject and won't jump into having a child to save a marriage, and trust me, I've kept myself away from her on purpose to avoid any advances from her that may lead up to an unexpected pregnancy that's the last thing I need. (Ironically though, it was something I wanted from the beginning of being married, glad that didn't happen)

Last semester I began to rock climb at the rec center and made two guy friends through it that I typically would climb with (since you need a partner). My boyfriend (of 4.5 years) only started this semester and is just starting out so he isn't quite at the same level as me. I still enjoy going with him and like spending time together doing this with him but I also like going with my regular partners because it is easier to improve personally when there are people around you at the same/a higher skill level. Also, I genuinely enjoy climbing with my two friends (who also know eachother and I -know- have no interest in me.)

My boyfriend gets a bit jealous/weirded out whenever I climb with them and says he wants to be my main partner. I try to go with him at least once a week and probably go a second time each week with one of the two friends. He refuses to let me invite one of them along and will not join me when I am with one of them, so it is hard when 3 people are asking me to do the same thing but my boyfriend will not go with either of the two.

",LovingTheNaiveGirl,70,13,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/17xz8j/my_m29_otherwise_brilliant_gf25_is_oblivious_to/,"Let me begin by saying my girlfriend is brilliant. You know when people use the expression, ""it doesn't take a rocket scientist?"" ""Chloe"" IS a rocket scientist. Not a proverbial rocket scientist either - that's actually her job. She is also physically quite attractive. I know, I know - I'm her boyfriend so I'm biased just a touch but she is tall, slender, has great big green eyes and gorgeous naturally curly hair.

There is something about Chloe, however, that flies in the face of all the brain power my girl has working for her - she is COMPLETELY naive about men. She has no concept whatsoever that they're hitting on her, and she's oblivious to the fact that her reactions to them could easily be construed as her flirting back. I trust that Chloe won't cheat on me, but she regularly crosses social ""boundaries"" and I fear she's going to put herself in situations that could escalate from awkward to downright dangerous.

Case in point: we went to a Super Bowl party yesterday. One of the guys there came up to her and introduced himself and was asking her about herself etc. She happily chatted away, asking him about himself as well and so on. After a bit she excused herself and came and sat on my lap on the sofa to watch the rest of the game. This guy saw us together, saw us holding hands, but he kept his eye on her the rest of the party. As we were leaving he said goodbye to her and that he'd like to keep in touch and asked if she was on Facebook. She said she was and he could find her on the host's friends list. It took less than an hour for him to add her as a friend and he has already asked her to hang out and maybe see a movie with him.

I explained to her how that made me uncomfortable and how this guy was clearly hitting on her and, bless her, she seemed totally baffled by the concept. Her response was, ""he saw us together, he knows I have a boyfriend."" When I said that it obviously didn't matter to him, she asked if I thought she would cheat on me. I don't think she would, so her reasoning is that if it takes two to cheat and one person doesn't want to, where is my concern?

She agreed not to carry on additional conversations with this guy, and I appreciate that, but I would prefer that she understand where I'm coming from on this and not just accommodate me to be nice. Like I said, I worry she'll get herself into a situation at some point she can't reason her way out of.

Any advice on how to communicate this?

**TLDR:** my (M29) otherwise brilliant GF (F25) is oblivious to how men communicate with her, and how she sometimes presents herself back. How do I help encourage her to be a little more streetsmart? We've been together about eight months.

We were both pretty miserable without each other and decided to work through our differences. One of the people she got involved with was a co-worker; when we decided to work on things we realized this was going to be an issue but decided we'd work on things together. 

Last night I get a text (she's in Vancouver and I'm in Seattle) asking me if it's okay if this person goes over. He had a bad day and needed someone to talk to. She's an early sleeper, usually in bed by 10, he was already in his way so I told her it was fine it just seemed off since she normally goes to bed before he was even going to get there. I told her it was fine just to keep me posted. 

I then get another text at midnight that says he's staying the night since its a long commute but he'll be sleeping on the floor. 

Early to be early to rise is normally the case; I get a text or call from her everyday around 7, 10:3O rolls around and I get a message that says she just got out of the shower and is getting ready to head out. 

The whole situation has left a bad taste in my mouth and I don't know how to feel.

I was tipsy and it was thundering that night. Her boyfriend's friends lived too far to walk home, and it was late at night. I suggested that they stayed over because I had extra towels, pillows, blankets and tea. Lots of tea. 

They came home, and stayed in the living room. They seemed like really good guys and nice people. The next day he said thank you for everything, and told me how sweet I was. 

The days later, one of the guys came to visit, and my roommate, her boyfriend, his best friend and I, all went out karaoke-ing. And got really drunk. The best friend started grinding with me, and kissing my neck, and I didn't mind too much. When we got home, I said that I didn't mind if he slept in the same bed because I was too drunk to get my pillows and blankets out for him. I never implied that we would have sex. I'm a virgin, so I don't do this type of stuff often (especially not drunk), but I can do oral really well

We cuddled in bed, and kissed. But I really didn't want anything more because I wasn't feeling good and I was tired. I couldn't feel my fingers, lips, teeth, or anything. He wanted me to give him a handjob though, and I kept repeating ""no, I don't want to"", and that I was tired and wasn't feeling well. I finally gave in and just tired to for him. Then I realized I really didn't want to, so I stopped. And told him no. I told him to back up because he was pushing me to the wall, and was getting closer. I told him to move back. He didn't. He just kept trying to touch my breasts and.. yeah... ..... 

Then we slept for a bit, and he woke me up about an hour later, and forced my hands, face, head, etc down to give him a blowjob. I kept resisting, and for the fourth time, he used both his hands to push my head down, and I got really upset and ran out of the bedroom, out the apartment, and down the stairs. My roommate ran after me. I was crying on the staircase. I've never been forced to do something I didn't feel like doing before.. I just felt so sick and tired. 

In the morning he left, and my roommate told me ""he said he thinks you were rude to have not finished what I started"", I feel really guilty about that.. I feel bad that he had to sleep in the living after what happened. I feel bad that I couldn't do what he wanted. I was drunk to not remember half of the night, but I DEFIANTLY remembered everything he tried to get me to do, and what I said. What do you guys think of this?

We love each other deeply and have no major issues. Marriage is often discussed.

*My argument:* 
I do not ever want children, and unless something neurological drastically changes, I doubt that I will change my mind. I do not like children, do not want to spend money on them, and do not feel rewarded by the time I spend with them.

I am considering getting my tubes tied at some point (in the next five years), and currently have an IUD.

*His argument:* My boyfriend thinks that I will love children if they have my genes. I suspect he is right: if somehow someone forced me to have children, I would probably love it, because it is helpless and it needs someone to love it, and it is mine after all.

BF says my life won't be ruined as he will be the SAHD, will make sure we have plenty of money socked away pregnancy.

*My Offer:* I told him that before we turn 30, he has to spend a week caring for a child. And if he still wants a child, we will have another talk. It's possible my biological clock will somehow kick in, but it is unlikely.

*His Offer:* BF says he will essentially be a single father if he has to, and raise the child by himself with a donated ovum/surrogate. But he doesn't want to leave me. This seems absurd to me, because if I am with him, I will be the secondary caregiver. His life will be different; he will presumably be a different person.

""We will work things out somehow,"" is his refrain. He doesn't want to think about how much of a dealbreaker this issue is.

*Questions*: Is it time for us to break up, or do I really need to wait the extra two years? Is my BF's offer reasonable, or could it never work?

I am very grateful for any responses, and if you need any more details, let me know.

TLDR: Boyfriend and I are at odds regarding having children. I am against, he is for. He has made a seemingly absurd offer. What should we do?

Almost out of the blue we had a talk last night and she asked where our relationship was going: are we going to get married.

She always asked this question before but I was never sure on an answer because I dont want to marry unless I have a stable job and could support my family. (we're both students)

She said she was getting tired of waiting (mind you we're both 25).

We had a long talk and the problem is that we are not compatible. I am thrifty and enjoy outdoorsy stuff and kind of emotionally detached, while she likes to dress up and look pretty and needs lots of affections.

We always have fights about these topics every few months. And when I get pissed off at her, I  threaten by asking her if we should break up or if we're not compatible. I dont mean it when I say it, but sometimes it really seems true, but I still want to make it work.

Turns out within the 6 years we were together, I somehow changed her, so now her peers say she looks haggard and her mom tells her she doesn't enjoy life anymore (""which is not the way she was raised,"" which is what her mom said). 

She said when we were first together, she was infatuated with me and was totally into my view of life. But recently she's realized shes changed so much from how she was before we met, and she doesn't like it.

She attributes these changes to me, and I agree. I am pessimistic and realistic about life.

She says for those reasons, we will always have the same fights come up even if we're married (how I'm thrifty and she wants to spend money, and how I dont show enough affection (like I come home and I greet our dog more enthusiastically than I greet her)). So she decided she didn't want that for the rest of her life.

She said the first 3 years we had a good relationship but the last 3 it started going downhill. I did feel the excitement in our relationship dying but I trusted her and thought it was a stable relationship.

I'm in denial right now. I can't believe it. It feels like someone is playing a joke. But I asked her repeatedly and she says we cannot get back together. We slept in the same bed last night and when I tried to snuggle she'd turn and push me away. I tried to hug and kiss her this morning and she turns away.

She acts different now when I talk to her, more guarded, less emotional. Its like talking to an acquaintance, which is weird cause just a few days ago we were close. I feel bad. She was always someone I could depend on and trust, and now shes gone.

We just signed the lease to rent a 1 bedroom apartment for a year. So I'm living with her for a year. How can I win her back? Should I pursue her? And what do I do if she starts bringing guys over?

I want to give her space and respect her, but at the same time I dont want to lose her. I still love her and care for her. But that might be the denial talking.

To me it just doesn't makes sense to throw away the last 6 years of experiences we've had together. But she says we've tried to make it work and I always end up forgetting within a few months and the spark dies.

Its funny because I always trusted her. I trusted she would come back to me if we ever did break up, but that's not true anymore. And now she told me she doesn't love me anymore.

I'm at a loss for what I should do or say, I really am. All of this happened months ago, sorry about the length.


I'd caught him getting overly friendly with a female coworker, asked him to please stop because it was making me uncomfortable, and he ended up having cyber sex with her a few days later (he later confessed, when I finally brought him physical evidence that I knew what was going on), almost like it was out of spite. When confronted, he told me he did it because he wanted to sleep with other girls....and ""he knew I wouldn't give him permission to."" This argument also sounded spiteful; something that would hurt me deeply. His story later changed.... he now says he wants to have a future with me.
 


Later, we talked things out. I found a therapist to work through self esteem issues I have. I thought I had worked things out, that things were going to get better for me, and us.



Now, we're doing ok. Talking about the future and doing other things devoted couples do. Unfortunately though, I still think about him going to work every day and seeing/talking to this girl he was so head over heels over a year ago. My brain and stomach cringe every single time I do. It makes me light headed and sick to think about them together; I picture them emailing or chatting through instant messenger every day like I don't exist or matter. She has/had a boyfriend when all of this happened too, and she knew he was dating me (I had met her before at a company party). I know she doesn't give a shit about us dating, and I'm assuming he doesn't either when they talk. I don't know if they still talk, though I do know he has to deal with her almost daily at work. I have no closure that they've stopped, or if she knows that he got caught. I assume not.




I feel like I can't let go of this. I want to be with him. He's tried to show me that I can trust him and that he cares about me. I'm still hurting, and I don't know how to handle it. Please advise :(



TL;DR: My boyfriend cyber-cheated with a girl he has to work with every day. He's stopped as far as I know and has been a great bf since, but I can't help being hurt and jealous. It drives me crazy that he sees her every day, I feel like an idiot. Please help.

A couple who are mutual friends of mine (34/M, 30/F) who we'll refer to as G(uy) and F(emale) respectively had an impromptu drunken threesome at a house party last weekend and I don't know what to do. G and F have been married 9 years and have 1 child in gradeschool. The party winded down around 2 when I left but the three of them kept drinking until around 4 or 5. Apparently the two couples that lived in the house went to bed and had sex and my friends and the other guy stayed in the living room and got to talking about sex and stuff. I could tell when I left she was interested in the 3rd guy (24ish?) just from how she was acting. The problem was that G wasn't down for it but F convinced him by telling him she'd do anal and let him give her a facial, among other things, but this didn't happen until later. Anyway, I know her and she's NOT into that stuff anyway and is actually pretty reserved sexually. To make matters worse H(ung) is super endowed, as in porn star and then some and G is only average sized. Anyway, they were all super drunk and F came onto G and whispered in his ear that they should go for it and then made the promises about a facial and anal. Between that and being drunk he decided to do it. However, when H dropped his pants he immediately backed out. According to G, H was bigger soft than G was hard. Ouch! F basically jumped G again and got him turned on with oral and got G into it, which worked. Again, they were drunk as hell. So here's G's main problem: he did get to have anal with her for the first time, but she was super enthusiastic about giving H oral, like way more vigorous and excited than anything G had ever gotten from her, and ~~she let~~ begged H finish on her face &amp; swallowed for her first time. That pissed off G who stopped and went out to the car. F claims she didn't realize G left and continued. G went back in a few minutes later and walked in with F and H doing anal. So it was bad enough she let H finish on her face, but she also swallowed and did anal with the other guy, things she promised G to get him into it making the promise not even a little bit special to him, if that makes sense. 

I feel really bad for him, he feels betrayed, is insecure about his size, and understandably so. So basically F convinced G to have a threesome with her and H against G's better judgement and she was really selfish about it and I have no idea what to say to him to make him feel better about it. 

TL;DR Mutual friends that are a married couple had a MFM threesome and F was selfish and now G is hurt and insecure. 

Edit 1: thanks for the comments everyone. And no, I'm not G. I'm bi, married in an open relationship, and have had group sex which I think is why they keep coming to me for advice.

We've been together for a little over a year and a half and we've talked about marriage 'in the future'.)

So for the past few weeks I've been really really sick. As in, I can't get out of bed because it feels like I've been hit by a truck, wanting to sleep all the time, constant headaches and body aches and just generally feeling extremely shitty. I chalked it up to some kind of alien death flu and just dealt with it because my job is extremely crazy right now and I don't have health insurance. Then about a week ago I started puking all the time. The only things I have eaten for the past few days is saltine crackers and bananas.  I mentally ruled out pregnancy because my boyfriend and I use protection and I bled (though looking back on it now, very lightly) right when I was supposed to get my period. 

My coworker convinced me to go to a free clinic today before work and they had me take a pregnancy test 'just in case'. Well reddit as I'm sure you've guessed by now I'm fucking pregnant. They did an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy and the first thing the nurse asked was 'Do you have any twins in your family?'. My grandma on my mom's side is a fraternal twin and I have 2 sets of cousins on that side of the family who are also fraternal twins. About 30 seconds later she drops the bomb on me. I'm 8 weeks pregnant with triplets.  A 1 in 8100 chance of naturally conceiving triplets and mother nature decided I'm the girl to do this to.

I haven't called and told my boyfriend yet. I'm barely processing it myself. This whole situation just feels completely surreal. For the past few hours I've been alternating between feeling numb and feeling irrationally tear-jerkingly guilty, like this is some how all my fault. Having even one baby right now would be a ginormous challenge. I don't get paid a lot but it's so far been enough to pay the bills and get by. My boyfriend has been unemployed for the past 8 months and it's really taking a toll on him. He was raised in a traditional 'a man isn't a man unless he has a job and provides' type family and he has been extremely depressed by not being able to get a job despite how hard he has been trying.To make things even worse, when he was in college he and his then girlfriend got pregnant and had an abortion. He says he knows it was the right thing to do but was (and still is) really bothered/upset by it. 

What the fuck do I do? I'm barely holding it together right now, how am I supposed to break this news to him in 3 hours when I get off work? The clinic gave me information about abortion and the nurse told me that selective reduction is always an option. I can't even process that information right now.  I really need some advice right now.This all just feels like a terrible dream that I'm not waking up from.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_nourc,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/nourc/this_is_so_far_from_a_christmas_miracle/,

About 4 months ago my wife wanted to go to the movies with friends from work.  1 Guy and 1 Girl.  A month later they all were going to go again but the girl didnt show up.  About 2 weeks ago my wife asks if she can go to the movies again with the same guy but with no girl.  I felt uncomfortable but told her to ""go ahead"".  Last week she tells me they are going to the movies yet again to see some horror flick. Now I am getting a little irritated.  I tell her that Ill go to the movies with her and her guy friend from work.  I would like to meet him.  She quickly says ""you wouldnt want to see that movie, plus who is going to watch the kids.""  Now the bells are going off. I told her I really didnt like the idea of them going and would prefer her stay home.  She went anyway.  She gets back from the movies at 1am (it was a 10:30pm showing) then proceeds to tell me that he bought concert tickets for them for a show this upcoming week.  This show is super heavy metal, stuff she doesnt even listen too.  She already told the guy she would go with him.  At that point I tell her this ends now, you can no longer hang out with this guy alone with out me meeting him.  She starts arguing that he already bought the tickets.  I tell her to make up a BS excuse why you cant go and if you feel that bad give him money for the tickets.  She then said she is going to go anyway. I then tell her that if she doesnt tell him I will.  Then all hell breaks loose.  She starts crying saying that if I end her friendship with the guy, our relationship is over!!!!      This flabbergasted me.  We have been together since high school, over 14 yrs total.  For her to say she would end our relationship for a friendship with a guy is mind boggling to me.  She says even if we dont go to the show we will still get lunch/dinner together during work.  I flat out told her shut the fuck up, you obviously have no respect for me, get out of my face.  She proceeded to cry and then go to work.    

WTF should I do&gt;??  Did I make some wrong decisions? Am I overreacting to this situation?  I just need to get this off my chest, feels like my world is crumbling lately
 

TLDR: wife is hanging out with a guy friend, I told her I dont like it, she said oh well


EDIT:  I know many people are saying a divorce, this would be the last step for me.  This happened to my parents when I was a child.  It has always been instilled that I would never do that to my kids if i was married.

EDIT 2:  She came home from work.   I said I am very confused and hurt by this situation.  She said what do you mean.  I said if this guy is your friend have him come over for dinner tomorrow, i would seriously like to meet him.  She said  absolutely not.  She talked to him at work and he feels awkward now.  I said so does he understand our situation??  Well i didnt tell him everything.  I then said we should go see a marriage counselor she declined.  She said possibly time apart would be better.  I personally think time apart would make things much worse.  More time for her to forget about me and devote to the new guy.  She also yelled at me for talking to my sister and mom about our situation.  I told her i needed to talk to someone to relieve stress and get advise from.   

EDIT 3:  Hopefully last one.  We talked again before she went to work.  I dug  and dug and got her to admit that she hugs the guy and that he has kissed her.  It's not her fault because she is not kissing him.....  She says it has happened a few times.  I mention that if she is telling me the entire truth she needs to let me read her texts to him.  She hands me the phone and says I already deleted some.  I told her tonight she must end everything with this guy.  She said what if i cant.  what if i still feel emotionally attached.  I may be fighting a lost cause I feel.  Waiting on a text to see if she actually went through with it.  

Edit 4:  After having almost no sleep, feeling nauseous and fighting nonstop  I decided to message this guy on facebook (one of her friends)

Im Jade's husband.  After having a long discussion with jade about what happened outside of work,I dont appreciate what happened putting our family at risk.  I had full faith and trust in jade hanging out with a friend from work alone.  You and her crossed the line. I would appreciate it if you never contact her outside of work ever again.  I understand you are work associates and you will see each other at work; If you are as good of a friend as you says u are please leave her and our family out of your life.  

He replied
I never pursued anything that wasn't wanted.  Its not a 1 way street for these kinds of things.  It takes 2 and works both ways.  I'm obviously concerned for her well being and I will wait to her back from her on this.  

At this point I told my wife she lied to me again saying he was the one coming after her.  I was going to go to his job and confront him about it.  She immediately yells He could get fired!! He's hurt enough""  I said he's hurt! what about me.  She said if i went to her work she would kill herself.  I went for the door again and she slapped me in  the face.  I picked up the phone and called 911.  She ran out of the door crying.  1 hr later. The police found he calmed but ok.  I never went to her job because i was worried for her safety.   I contacted her ont the phone about 2 hrs after all of this she said she is embarrassed and has never felt so low in her life dont talk to her ever again.

I can give a bit more background information as well.

Original post: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/if670/do_i_have_trust_issues_or_is_this_not_right/

Finding out she cheated:
http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ifkb2/i_was_right/

The emails I found were only one days worth of corresponding. She seems infatuated with the guy, it's hard to believe. I honestly thought we were at a high point in our relationship/marriage. Turns out the little things that she didn't like are what apparently caused her to do this, I have spoken with a few people (friends, family, work) all are shocked as we've always been seen as a couple that seemed unbreakable. Tons of shock and awe I guess you could say. But in explaining my 'deficiencies' these were all the same things that everybody deals with in a marriage and are so minor (i.e. leaving clothes in the bathroom after showering). Myself and others were confused as to why these little things could escalate into a full blown emotional affair. For me there were a lot of things that bothered me, made me annoyed, all the same things she was saying but I in no way thought about leaving (let alone cheating) on her because of them. Everyone said ""It makes no sense"" which is exactly I how felt. 

The crazy thing is when the dust settled and she gave her reasoning she still tried to act as if they were just friends, even though she admits she made a ""big mistake"". She called it friend love, even though she asked him ""do you love me or luv me"" and discussed how much money we have, how we'd split in a divorce, said she loves him, was meant to be with him, wishes she met him a long time ago, that they're perfect and have so many of the same desires, that he opened her eyes and she finally found what she was looking for, and all the emails ending with ""xoxoxo missing you"" or similar. 

She actually said to me that ""I was happy just not 100%"" in apologizing today, and that she felt like her nor I were giving it 100%. 

I also want to mention the comment I made about ""I am a really good guy, I've never hit, yelled, or treated her bad and honestly feel proud of how I treated her with such respect."" I am not saying that statement alone makes me a good guy. I was tired, emotional, and laying on a couch alone (around 4:00am) opening up on here, but I know in my heart (I really have nothing to prove either way) that I'm a really good guy, and that all those things are true, but that was my way of saying that I've never done anything blatant to make her do this. In fact I have countless emails, texts, and she said it all the time how wonderful I was of a husband, how caring, thoughtful, loving, etc she told me how the girls at her work were jealous of her because of how great her husband was and said she always bragged about me. I don't want to stay on the high horse here, but I am confident I offered her something that she'll have a hard time ever finding again.

Anyways, I hate being too long winded, I'll reply to the comments in here and in the previous thread when I get home (at work now). But for those who care, last night was the toughest, I had no sleep, had a 1hr nap, woke up, and felt emotional, it was just so many emotions and everything mixed I couldn't contain myself. I took a walk and then got my mom to meet me so we could chat, put a few things into perspective and when I woke up today (after a nice sleep) things felt good. She asked about working on our marriage and emphasized how it was only one big mistake, and although I am a forgiving person I don't know how on earth I could ever trust her again as I still feel like she's lying and still don't know the truth. Our split of assets is going good, she's being fair and we're keeping it friendly. I came into work this afternoon as I didn't want to sit at home and brew on all this crap, it's nice to get my mind off of it for a while and be productive, I also have some great co-workers who were good ears and it always feels better talking things out to get perspective. 

Through an unrelated set of unfortunate family events a trip was cancelled this week that my mom, dad, brothers and sister were planning (golf) and on a whim we've decided to head to California next week, it'll be a nice break and a great start to a new life. 

One of my co-workers suggested I look into counselling I think she thinks I'm keeping my emotions bottled because I was in an upbeat mood, but that's who I am, my mom even told me a quote (I suck at remembering quotes) but I got the point and it was something about hatred breeds poison or something but anyways that how I've always lived my life, yeah there are times where it just fucking sucks, and you're dealt some bad blows, things happen good/bad, and it's all about how you respond, but for me and this is the most important being angry, upset, and sad accomplish nothing, this does suck in terms of losing someone who really meant the world to me, but I'll be damned if I can't find someone better &amp; being negative would only hurt my chances at doing so. My moms hilarious though because she's said ""Don't go out drinking all the time now"" &amp; ""You need to get out lots now"" which are not indicative of who I am at all, but it was just funny motherly advice that I guess she felt needed to be said.

We are doing really well, haven't argued or fought about anything, so things are going great.

Here is the problem.. She is mormon (I am too, I just have been inactive for a few years because I am lazy and like to sleep on my weekends) so I assumed that she was pretty innocent to sex and things like that. Little did I know, her parents have never had ""the talk"" with her or her sister who is only two years younger. Not only that, but they would not allow her to go to the maturation programs provided by the school.

She has absolutely no idea what sex is, other than ""it's how baby's are made."" 

Anyways.. the thing I am wondering- Should I be the one to talk with her about it, since her parents obviously aren't going to? She has actually brought it up and said she wants to know and she wants me to be the one to tell her. (I wouldn't include her sister into the talk because to be quite honest, I would feel extremely awkward.)

I feel like I should talk to her about it, because by this age, you need to know about that stuff. In my opinion it's one of those things that everyone needs to know about if you are going to have a boyfriend.

1294384906.0,56,self.relationship_advice,exrny,20 years of listening to my parents argue has totally warped my view of relationships. Has anyone else dealt with something similar?,thr0wn0ut77,69,13,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/exrny/20_years_of_listening_to_my_parents_argue_has/,"23, male. My parents argue all the time--around once a day. It's an issue in itself, but not really why I'm here. When I was younger I used to think that their fighting didn't bother me that much since I'd tune it out and I was used to it. However, I'm now starting to think it totally defines how I think of relationships. I don't have a girlfriend, nor have I ever and I find that my first and most powerful response to any potential romantic connection is to retreat and avoid it. Even the idea of letting a woman know I might be interested goes against all my instincts. This works out to some extent in that I can control my emotions enough to push down any crush to the point where I can ignore it until the opportunity is gone, but it's not like doing so makes me happy.  
  
I think a part of my problem is that I can't convince myself that a potential relationship won't be a burden emotionally (as my family is). I really want to connect with someone, but I just can't imagine it so forcing myself to fight past my initial reaction is very difficult. I'd also rather be alone and think I don't deserve it than not be alone and think I deserve to be. That's probably rationalizing, but I do see it as a potential outcome.  
  
I suspect therapy is the first thing people will recommend, but for various reasons (like money) it's not an option right now.

I was at a local pub last night having a christmas drink with my best friend, we rarely get to hang out by ourselves so we were having a great time just chilling.

There were just two of us at a rather large table, when a group of 5 guys asked if they could share it with us.

""Of course"", we exclaimed! We are friendly people in a friendly city...can't see anything wrong with new friends! They joined us and we got along famously! We broke the ice by buying the first round of drinks for everyone and we all were having a great old time. There is the normal amount of flirting going on...its casual and not super serious. Just an all round great time with new people.

If I were to break this group down into stereotypes the 5 guys would have gone something like this;

1) Relatively good-looking trendy 'life of the party' guy. (1st one to break the ice and start conversations instead of standing awkwardly) progressively got a little tooo drunk....

2) Super awkward guy who compensates by being the know it all...yet still very nice and entertaining

3) Sports guy (ski racer dude) better looking than he knows....yet he kinda suspects he may be a hottie....but still shy.

4) Software engineer guy...super friendly and interesting (yet totally has a GF)

5) The ""nerdy"" guy. Book guy....smart, yet slightly insecure. Used to not being paid attention to because everyone else is quite gregarious in social situations (as well as the fact that his friends are constantly 'picking' on him). Slightly embarrassed by the drunken antics of his friends...guy.

SO cut to a little later in the evening when Mr. Uber creep decides to hit on my BF and I. We are never really good at these sorts of things and can't get rid of him politely. During this time the awesome group we were hanging with drifts slightly away (and in all honesty looked like the shunned puppy walking away sadly). All except guy 5...who I look at and indicate that we would appreciate a hand...

Guy 5 dives right in. Is friendly, and deftly maneuvers the guy away, entertained the dude for a few minutes and returned. A hero in our eyes for more reason than one. In all honesty after that he was the only one I wanted to talk to. I of course talked and joked with all his friends still....because to not would be rude. But guy 5 had proven himself to be an awesome all round guy. He was also the most authentic and I thought we were totally groovin'.

Cut again to the end of the night Guy 2 tells my BF that the rest of them want to invite us over but don't really know how to do it. She tells him that we wouldn't come over...so sorry. (Just not the type to go to random dudes houses at 3am...not that we wouldn't want to hang with them again....)

Guy 1, 2, 3, and 4 all start heading to the door and guy 5 lingers to say goodnight...there was the awkward moment where neither of us are sure what to do....and then it gets toooo awkward and we just say peace out.

WHY OH WHY did he not get my contact info???.....why oh why did I not offer it....dang it....opportunity missed and I go home and cuddle my cat.

Cut once more to today....when finishing my Xmas shopping with another friend....I see guy 5 walking down the street....unfortunately on the other side....but we wave and shout a conversation across the road....which is awkward for both of us...and once again the opportunity passes and we again go our separate ways.

Curious to put my newly acquired secret santa internet stalking skills to use I used the knowledge of his name and where he worked to find his work number and email address.

How creepy is that? Would he be freaked out if I sent him an email being like....""soooo I kinda thought you were cool....coffee?""??

I should mention that I hate making the first move. I know that is terrible in this day and age and I will attract the ire of feminists and guys alike....but I just like feeling like a girl and having the guy ask....so this maneuver of mine is quite out of my comfort zone....but I very rarely meet guys that I am interested in....WHAT TO DO REDDIT!!!???

**TL:DR - Met awesome ""nice-nerdy"" guy. Missed two opportunities to get contact info. Internet stalked for email. Creepy or not to say 'what up I think you are kinda cool'?**

**Edit 1: BF in this case means ""Best Friend"" I didn't realize people would think otherwise...but no I am not in an open relationship...soorrry for any mis-understandings!**

Would I be a bad person for leaving her?",ReallySickGF,83,22,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/e2hvv/help_reddit_my_gf_is_always_sick_throwing_up_and/,"A little background: I've been dating this girl for more than a year. We got serious pretty quickly, that is I moved into her place less than a month after we met, I'm pretty sure I love her, she definitely loves me. I think she's a pretty great girlfriend, abet not the most sexually active or adventurous I've ever dated, but that's not a big deal to me.

Well it doesn't bother me as much as the every-other-day-vomit-and-diarrhea sessions. Basically, she says she has IBS, but doesn't really seem interested in seeing a GI or general doctor that won't just brush her off. She doesn't seem to try very hard to watching her diet and make changes to it so she's not as sick as often. What caused me to make this throwaway account and start this thread is that we went to a holiday party at her work last night, and even though she's sure it's one of her sickness-triggers, she still ate pineapple, and she got sick at the party and has been sick since. I'm not talking a little sick, violent vomiting, diarrhea, she shakes and gets all red-faced, bad enough for me to ask her if she needs to go to the hospital. Honestly, sometimes I feel like she's playing it up for attention, I don't know why, maybe it's because she seems to do absolutely nothing about it, probably because I can nothing to help her. I don't even know if she really has IBS, she's one of those people who like going on webMD and self-diagnosing.

We've talked about it and I know there's nothing I can do about her stomach condition and nothing I can do to keep the vomit and diarrhea inside of her, but it really fucking bothers me when she gets sick like this because it's really fucking bad and there's nothing I can do for her. And I am *fortunate* enough to get detailed updates about her diarrhea/vomit and wake up in the middle of the night to her wretching (it's really intense).

I really just don't understand. If I were even half as sick as she was I would be at the doctor constantly trying to figure out how to get better (she has insurance and time to go).

Two days ago, my boyfriend took me out for dinner, knowing that we had to ""talk"". I spoke with him briefly ahead of time and told him that I had something to discuss with him. When I confronted my boyfriend, he denied cheating on me. After I showed him the proof I had (pics, texts, etc...) he admitted to the deed. He told me he loved me, but couldn't handle all that was attached to being with me. I broke up with him, held my own, and didn't break down and cry until I got home.

It's pretty depressing really. He did apologize, but it doesn't really mean much now. I've been binging on comfort food, and I'm quite dismayed at the weight I feel I'm gaining. Either way, I don't plan to mope around. Earlier today, I dropped off the kids at my grandmothers house; they've been missing her dearly, and I could use the alone time. I have two weeks to pamper myself, and I plan to do just that. Hopefully it will help.

I'm pissed. He didn't even bring us his wives and children around to anywhere. I was the one who drive my mums and siblings to every single thing.

We went to a nice restaurant, where my husband refused to order any food, because none of it appealed to him. He asked for a Caesar salad, and they brought him a side salad of romaine lettuce with croutons covered in a creamy dressing. He took two bites of it, then refused to eat any more, saying the let tusche or dressing tasted funny.
  He refuses to eat my food when I cook, and so did the children, so I stopped cooking. What he cooks is bland and usually dry, and he almost always makes chicken tenders for the kids, 14 and 8. He never cooks vegetables, or tries to make healthy food. Whenever my parents offer to take us to a restaurant, he refuses to go or when he gets there, refuses to order anything.

    The food info is just background. I had been supporting this family financially since 2006 when he lost a decent job. Last year I had a nervous breakdown, and have been unable to work or find a job since then.  It is only through the largesse of my mother that we have been able to stay in our home.
Back to last night.  During our dinner out, he mentioned that he doesn't like kids. The gist of the conversation ended up with his saying he never wanted children, and I was like, then why did you marry me? His answer, because I love you. How can a man who won't eat the food his wife cooks, refuses to support his family, and dislikes his children immensely claim to love his wife?

1371666924.0,56,self.relationship_advice,1go6kg,[25/f] My boyfriend's [27/m] priorities aren't in order and it's ruining our relationship,ratrway3187,77,21,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1go6kg/25f_my_boyfriends_27m_priorities_arent_in_order/,"Me: 25, F, College educated, steady well paying job as a consultant.
Him: 27, M, College educated, employed as an engineer.
Time together: 3 1/2 years. 

A little background: we met online. We have been living together for a year and a half, have a dog that we got together. He bought a house a year and a half ago that we moved into. We chose the house together, but I am not on the deed or the mortgage, and we do not combine finances.

I am finding it difficult to explain what the problem is in a brief enough paragraph that everyone will read it. But suffice it to say, I don't feel that his priorities are in order. 

He is extremely cheap, to the point of being offensive. He will take me out, but he will complain bitterly about how expensive it is (even a $30 dinner for 2 at Carrabbas). He is in his cousin's wedding this year, and has complained bitterly multiple times that he has to spend $250 on a tuxedo for the event. This is someone who takes home $5k a month, and has no debt except for the house and his brand-new sports car.

However, spending money for the things he wants (spent $600 on wheels for his sports car, but only after three agonizing weeks of ignoring me constantly to stalk craigslist for them) is no problem. He has 2 cars (one a 2010 that is paid for, one a 2013 sports car that is not) and an italian motorcycle that recently needed $1000 in parts. The motorcycle recently sat for a year before fixing it because he needed to obsessively search ebay for a ""good deal"" on parts.

This is becoming a real problem. There are things that need to be fixed in the house that he bought and pays for, but he ""has no money"" for these things. However, he has recently been talking about wanting to buy a newer, faster italian motorcycle. He wants me to split the repairs to the home, but I refuse to because I do not have equity in the home and I am not an ATM to pay for things that he doesn't want to spend ""his"" money on. Last year I ended up paying to renovate the kitchen because it needed to be done and he was saying he was too broke after putting up the downpayment to spend the $2000 it cost to do it ourselves. I found out later that last year he had roughly $20k in the bank-- at least, until he blew $8k on the down payment for his sports car.

This has recently become a pressing issue because we have been talking about getting engaged. We have actually been talking about getting engaged before he bought the house. I agreed to help him choose ""our"" house etc on the premise that we would be getting married.

I recognize that 3 1/2 years is not a particularly long time to be together before getting engaged, but we both have steady careers, our own little fur baby, and the house. I pay more than my own way, including paying all the utilities for the house since he pays the mortgage, and aggressively paying down my student debt because the debt ""bothers"" him and he claims it is a ""detriment to our future"" when I would argue that buying $50k+ in motorized toys is worse. Cest la vie-- let's just say I am not a drain on him financially and I have never asked him to help me out.

Anyway, he has now promised me 3 times that he would propose to me and we could start planning a wedding. The first promise was the day we bought the house: he promised me that he would propose when we got a dog because he ""really wanted a dog of his own."" We moved into the house at the end of Jan 2012 and we got the dog in March. He promised again that he would propose that year.

New Years Eve 2012 came and went, no proposal came in 2012. We had a ""discussion"" about it in which I shared simply that my feelings were very hurt by him making a promise he wouldn't keep. He said he felt really bad for making me feel bad and he promised that he would propose by his birthday in May.

His birthday came and went without a ring. A few days after that I asked him if he remembered the promise he made me. He basically said ""what promise?"" and then said if he did promise that, it was only so that I would be happy. I asked how breaking promises was supposed to make me feel and he said again that he didn't mean to hurt my feelings. Then he said he needed to save up to buy a ring this year. 

A little backstory on the ring: I don't want anything fancy. He KNOWS I don't want anything fancy. We've picked rings together and the price for the one I wanted was $1150. I do not think this is a substantial sum for someone who saves roughly $2k a month, and was considering spending $1200 on wheels alone for his car. But apparently he needs to ""save up money.""

So anyway, he promises me again that he will propose this summer. Then he decided to take a new job that does not give him any vacation time until next year. We spoke about it again and he expressed that he ""can't do anything this year"" because of his new job.

Am I wrong to just think that this is not happening and I should pack up and move on? Marriage is important to me and I have been clear about that from the beginning. I love him very much, and it really isn't even about the engagement anymore-- it's about making promises to me about our life together that he is not willing to keep. I am beginning to feel that I (and our life together) come a far second to his toys. I feel that I'm worth a lot more than that and I don't feel that he is taking responsibility or getting his priorities straight.

In these 6 month we've been having a lot of issues and many pity arguments. I am not in love with him and have lost an attraction for him, but I do think he is a good personal and in general treats me very well. The truth is I don't want to be in relationship with him because I don't have feelings for him and don't think we are going to work out. We have many differences in personality, opinions, life style. etc. So for the past couple of month I have tried breaking up with him 3 times. Every time he becomes very upset at first but then starts to apologize, blame himself, beg for another another chance, and promises to change. Yesterday, we  pity argument again, and I realized that I do not care for the relationship enough to make it work and that I am certain we should break up. I told him that and he got very angry. He start yelling, cussing, calling me names and just being very disrespectful (That was happening on a phone). I told him I want to break up and he said ""No. Bitch, Shut up, don't ever tell me that again. We are NOT going to break up. You will stay on a phone with me and fix this. "" I replied ""no, we are going to break up"". At this point he said things which scared me..a lot . He said - ""I will come find you right now, I will hurt you, I will fuck you up. I know where you live, I will come and fuck up your family. I don't even care if I go to jail for that."" After about 10 minutes he realized what he did and become very apologetic, said he did not mean it and only said that because he was very angry. Anyways last night I spent a lot of time convincing him that we should break up, and eventually he accepted and said he will never call me again. Today he called me 6 times before I picked up. He wanted to talk over how we ended up ""here"", what went wrong and how we can fix it. In other words he is trying to pull me back into relationship. 
Now, ideally, I would cut all the contacts and stop replying to him or  answering the phone. But from what he said yesterday I am afraid he comes looking for me or harass my family or just do something bad if I cut the contacts and refuse to communicate. 

TL; DR Tried breaking up with my bf after an argument on a phone. He became very angry and said he will hurt me and my family if I do it. Not sure how to proceed to safely cut him loose. 

UPDATE: Thank you very, very much everyone for responding. Your feedback was extremely helpful and you helped me to be strong in my decision to break up with him.  I have followed your advices and took the needed precautions. I spoke with him again because he wanted a ""closure"" and after that we both agreed to cut all of the communication.

He is angry, abusive (mentally ...mostly) and an asshole. But why can't I just leave?

We have been living together, just us 2, for the past 5 months. He has had his angry breakdowns more than once in the past 5 months. 

One time he was holding me against a door and I finally got so angry that I decided to fight back and I kneed him in the stomach.. and he bit my arm.

I want to leave, so bad. I don't know why I haven't done anything before. I am just so scared of what might happen if I do. I don't know what I will do.

I will walk away from this relationship, horrified and afraid of being with another guy. And he will walk away blaming me, saying I was a bad girlfriend and everyone will hate me... that is what happened to his ex. From what I have heard, many similar things have happened with her. She had the courage to end it.. it probably helped that she was older than him. I feel like because I am younger, he has the power. I feel controlled.

While I have been with him, I have also been speaking to this other guy. [19/m] He hates my boyfriend, he hates hearing about what happens, and he is the only person I can talk to. Sometimes I wish I was with him. 

Every time my boyfriend gets angry and abusive, he says sorry and cries, and then he goes out and I lay in bed in the dark, crying, listing to music and asking myself what did I do to deserve this? 

I guess the advice I am seeking here Reddit is... what do I do and how do I do it..?

I just don't know.

**UPDATE:** I don't know if you all really want to know, but I just want to say thank you to all the people who helped me.

I have spoken to my mother and my sister about my situation and they agree that I should get out. My sister has offered to let me stay with her when I do as I don't want to be at my mothers house because he knows where her house is and I don't know what he will do.

I will also be speaking to his mother about this before I do anything, she knows how he is, and I think her and I both know that he won't change. He was like that as a child, and will be like it the rest of his life. And I think he knows that also.

I don't want to leave without giving him some closure, because I know that will only be worse for him, but I will be speaking to him in person, with the support of my sister and her husband if anything should go wrong.

I found this because I saw posts in her email. She told the men that she was looking for someone else because her current casual just found a girlfriend. I confronted her about this with our pastor from church. She told us that she did not hook up with anyone yet but she was just about to that night. She said that she would knock it off and that she was going to stop doing these things. The next week after she talked to our pastor by herself she came home and told me that she hadn't been completely honest, that she did have sex with one of her co-workers before we caught her but she was going to start going to therapy and hopefully we could move past this. This really hurt me, but we have 2 kids and I wanted to try and save the marriage for them. Things started to get better between me and my wife in fact we started having sex like 2-3 times a day, prior to this for 7 years we maybe had sex 4-5 times a month. Then all the sudden she said she was getting her period and then the sex stopped. Even after her period the sex was nowhere near as frequent as it had been for those few weeks. Then one day I was sitting at work and got a text message. The content of the message was something like ""It is a good thing I did not kiss you because someone at our church just walked by"". I was devastated. I told my boss that I had a family emergency and had to go home. So when I got home I confronted her. She told me that she wants to have her family and this guy on the side (the coworker from before). I told her that cannot happen. I told her that I had started to look at attorneys. She said she would knock it off. But I have a strong inkling that she is still seeing him. She comes home late from work (always with an excuse that they were slow closing that night or some drama happened that caused them to have trouble closing). I have also looked at our cell phone records online and can see that she is texting her coworker multiple times a day. I have seen the content of some of her messages on her cellphone. She has pictures of his penis and told him that she would rather be with him. I have started to see a therapist myself to help me straighten out what is going on. When I am at work or when I am not around her, I feel like it has to end that she is using me because I have a better job than her. Then when I see her, for some reason I become weak and want to believe what she tells me.

I have again started to try and find an attorney for divorce, but they are very expense. Retainers are high to start and I have very little money.

We recently moved because of my job and my wife quit her job last summer. She told them about the plans for the move and was given the option to stay for a few weeks or quit. She quit and received unemployment. It has since run out. She has been trying...not very hard...to find work. After many interviews she was offered a position, but has since started doubting the job as ""difficult/not what I want/bad part of town"" and seems to be on the way to not accepting the job. She told them  'Yes' last week. She had another interview that same week, and it hoping on this other place offering her a job. I am hoping they do as well, but this first job is in the bag. With a great starting pay. She is very defensive when she makes her mind up and I want to be as tactful as possible in expressing my need (we are still around $70K in debt) for her to take the job. However I know any rebuttle from me will end in a fight about me ""not caring for her"" or something. She also did not work for nearly a year on our first move and has regretted it since. I took a job so she could be near her family, which I hated, worked 100+ hour weeks, and developed ocd because of the constant stress of that job. Currently she sits at home all day and does nothing besides look at the internet and complains about the lack of a job and her body image. I have tried getting her to a gym but that is no luck. This has affected our sex life as well as she has put on over 100 ish pounds since we first were wed. I feel as if I'm doing all the work and not receiving any help. I should mention that I am constantly cooking dinner, doing laundry and taking care of her while my needs go unnoticed. (Stuff like I give her a massages to total about 4 hours a week, while I haven't gotten a massage for about 3 years. She also has promised blowjobs and the like about half a dozen times for the past 3 years and not given...this im not too worried about...but it is the promise and me getting excited about it and being let down. I liken it to taking her to a fancy jewerly shop and promising gifts, and not following through.)

She keeps talking about how much she wants a job, but won't jump on this one.

And I'm sorry for the wall o' text that may come of this post.

I'll begin with my parents (trust me, this is relevant). They are old school. My father is a retired cattle-rancher and my mother is a former rodeo-queen turned executive. My parents were raised very strict and conservative with old-fashioned values. My father feels entitlement to everything, while my mother allows him to walk all over her to keep him happy. She never stands up for herself. As a very successful business woman, this has always, always bothered me that she cannot stand up to my irrational and often drunk father. (They aren't my problem though)

My boyfriend, our mutual friend, and I were hanging out last night and drinking ensued as usual. I could tell they were quite drunk, I hadn't had anything to drink last night. Our mutual friend, lets call him Jeff, had just broken up with his girlfriend and they were bro-talking his next move to get over the girl. My boyfriend, lets call him Alex, decided that he would make an off-hand comment when telling Jeff how he needs to find a ""sane"" girl that has it together. He continued to trail off into a story about when he met my mother. ""When I met Tasha's mom.. she was cool as shit. And I knew Tasha would be cool as shit too."" He then got a big grin on his face and said ""Her mom really knows her place, she knows that a man gets what he wants, when he wants it. I knew Tasha was raised right when I met her mom"". 

I brushed it off as him just being funny. He will make sexist jokes and never mean them, and I actually find them funny a lot of times and laugh them off. But this comment, being something that actually gets under my skin wasn't something I could laugh off or joke about. He knows how I feel about the way my mom is with my dad. So today, while he's at work and I am off for the day, all I can think about is whether he really thinks of me this way. 

I can't shake the feeling, and the general relationship_advice answer would be to talk to him and tell him how I feel... I'm not good at expressing my feelings outwardly. I'm a private person in that respect. We've been together for 6 months, lived together for 1 month, and he has yet to see me shed a tear. I'm not emotional usually. I guess I'm asking the men here, do you think he meant the comment and really thinks that I'm going to be a doormat to him like my mother is to my father?

**EDIT**: I guess my post came off a little different than I wanted it to. I have had a lot of great advice and I am definitely considering the options you all have brought to the table. But to be clear, I am not completely shut-off to him about everything. I tell him when something is bothering me, and he has always been very receptive. But, I also know when to pick my battles. What I was looking for was some perspective on the comment. As in, was it a joke or not. If it was intended to be funny (even though it wasn't), then I can let it go. If it wasn't a joke, then I will have to talk to him about it. And if he does make or do anything like this again he will be hearing it from me. I know that because my mother is one way, I am very likely to mirror her actions as I am developing into my own person and relationships. But I am aware of this fact and do not let it occur.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1362095296.0,,,True,t3_19f3wn,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/19f3wn/my_26m_boyfriend_of_6_months_made_a_comment_that/,

 Early this morning I come back home from my friend's dorm.  I went to go check my laptop for Facebook and whatnot. I notice that the green light isn't on on the charger which is plugged in. I open the laptop and liquid starts pouring out from it. A lot of it. I run and grab a towel and start to mop it up. It's a fowl smelling liquid. Long story short, I determined that someone opened my laptop, urinated inside of it, and then closed it because the top of the laptop wasn't wet at all.

My roommates all deny it and they say that the people they had over Friday night (I was gone most of that night as well) didn't do it. I hadn't used my laptop since Thursday so I don't know when this happened. The last thing I did with my laptop of put it on my desk and plug it in. 

Now after talking with with my roommates some more I have this information: 

Roommate #1: very, defensive about it. 
""I'm sorry this happened, but no one here did it! So stop bringing it up"" Insinuating that I did it. He is short, though, and I don't think he'd be able to pee on my desk and laptop with out standing on a chair. Which he would have fallen off. Also he isn't one to get super wasted so I don't think it was him. 

Roommate #2: tried cocaine Saturday night. Got very drunk the night on Friday. Got defensive as well. Asked if I was sure I didn't do it. (I'm sure I didn't. I came back on Friday slightly drunk, went to the actual bathroom to pee and brush my teeth, then went to sleep. On Saturday, I was completely sober). 

Roommate #3: seemed genuinely surprised. I don't think it was him. 

Friend #1: Was over Friday night when I was out. Was ""wasted"" that night according to roommate #1. 

Friend #2: Over Friday night when I was out. Was ""wasted"" that night according to roommate #1. Does ""crazy things"" when he is drunk according to another friend. 

How do I go about confronting them? I've talked to my roommates, but not the friends that were over. Im currently drying it in a sealed bag with rice, but i have no idea if it'll turn on again. Any experience with similar situations?

Thanks in advance RA

1356018861.0,53,self.relationship_advice,1566nh,M(36) married for 3.5 years to F(47) - feeling like I can't handle the age difference anymore,smoovebb,74,21,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1566nh/m36_married_for_35_years_to_f47_feeling_like_i/,"Hi-not sure about posting this but here goes:

I've always been one to get lost in relationships with women - doing a lot to keep them happy - often at a cost to my own happiness.  Unfortunately, I often internalize issues that come up until some sort of breaking point when I can't handle things as they are any more.  Reaching this point is an extremely slow and painful process - which often leads me to a lot of solitary drinking/'partying'.

The woman I'm married to is a great person.  We have been together for about 5 years and married for 3.5.  She is caring, thoughtful, financially successful, and quite attractive for her age.  She also has a son (15).  We tried to have a child together a couple of years ago but it didn't work out for medical reasons on her end.  I get a long well with her son, but he still has a father out there and really needs nothing from me so our bond isn't that strong.

To top all of this off, I moved from my home state and family several years ago for a job - I think I actually did that on some level to break up with my girlfriend at the time.  Although my life is OK here in the midwest, this was never a place I imagined spending my life for both cultural and weather reasons.  In addition, I'm something of an introvert so making new friends isn't something that comes naturally.

The point being - I'm starting to feel like I can't handle things anymore.  I feel very lonely but I don't know how to deal with it.  The age difference has started to bother me more and more (even though from a purely logical perspective it makes no difference), plus the fact that she has such a great relationship with her son.  I can't help but keep thinking that if I stay in this marriage, I'll never have either that same bond with a child, nor a more deeply interdependent relationship with a spouse as often occurs with childless couples.  In addition, I'm a low-brow male and seeing attractive young women is a constant reminder of how things could be different....grass is always greener I suppose.

I feel like I need to get out of this situation, but I also can't bear the thought of hurting my wife.  She is such a good person and cares about me very much.  I don't want to break her heart as I have with others in the past.  The stress of this seemingly impossible situation seems to be affecting me physically and often leads to both depression and hopelessness.  I'm pretty sure you can't work things out if you are dead.

I could ramble on endlessly with details, but I think that sums up the long and short of things.  What I would like is either a way to be happy with things as they are, or a way to feel good about making a change.  Thanks

You've give me new perspective and hope :-)   The majority of responses to my question have been very helpful.

Hopefully this is a start to things again - I know things will never be the same, but I hope that even through all this crap we will figure this out and stay together. Then again I could just be getting my hopes up. So now the wait 'til friday, already impatient to get there. Would it be a bad idea to call/text her during the week?*

**Update #2:** I got tired of not having answers so I went to her place to inspect the garage and her room and stuff. When I got there the dog was out so I thought something was up, I brought him back inside and looked around, noticed her light in her room was on. I went in and she was there, she freaked out, closed the door and locked it.
I spoke to her through the door and calmed her down. Then we talked for a bit and from everything that was said she doesnt remember at all. At first she wanted nothing to do with me and asked me to leave, we talked for a bit more and she changed her mind.
We went out for dinner with a group of people (some of whom I knew, they were old friends of hers - none know what happened). So we talked throughout the night, danced a bit, I'm bad and she has been dancing for years so I don't think I won points there. But we held hands a bit and she seemed to be calm and ok. By the end of the night she seemed indifferent to me being there. Perhaps I am over thinking it b/c we used to be so close that last night comes off as distant, I could tell she was tired, and during the night she said all of it was a bit overwhelming anyway.
So hopefully she is still open to talking with me and we can rebuild something, but at the very least I know so is ok (kind of) and is on track to getting back to life and stuff. As far as I know she is returning to work and school next week, and has counseling as well, although I don't know the details yet.
I'm just nervous b/c we have lost so much, despite everything that has happened, I feel kind of in a rush to speed things up and get back to where we used to be, but I'm trying to calm down and remember this is all new to her and these things cannot be rushed, especially with these circumstances. And the more I push, the more she may be overwhelmed and become distant.

My ex-fiancee (and recently girlfriend again) attempted to hang herself 4 days ago and has been in a coma since. Luckily she woke up about a day ago, although she has no memory of hurting herself, or even of the last few years. She doesn't remember who I am at all, she thinks she is in high school studying for the SATs and with her ex-boyfriend (guy that has multiple personalities and beat/raped her). 

Should I talk to her? What should i even say? 

She changed a lot over the last few years, and according to her good friend was a completely different person back then. I don't know what to do, or even where to start.

I reach for it and give it to her. While I give the phone to her I make it wake up so she'll be able to read it right away and then I see that it's from a number that's not in her phonebook. I don't think much of it and give it to her and she grabs the phone fast in a nervous way like she's trying to hide the display from me. I ask if it's from her sister who she often txt with and she says it is. She then turns back to me while txting her sister which she openly shows me.
There's only one problem. The last message from her sister was received hours ago and the most recent txt was sent to her by my gf. Also when she's done texting I get to see her inbox for a split second which shows that unknown number as the latest txt. After this she doesn't let me get close to her phone and freaks out when I grab it. She never had a problem with me using her phone before.

So reddit, should I just accept that she wants some privacy and drop it or confront her about it and ask what's up with it?


Update:
I asked her face to face why she acted weird after getting the txt. She were acting like she had no idea what I was talking about. When I told her that I know the txt wasn't from her sister she suddenly remembered that it was from her friend who got a new phone recently with a new number. The funny thing is that her friends old number magically works today. When I asked to see the txt she handed over the phone without hesitating. However, I noticed that a lot of her txts were deleted so it's obvious that she cleaned up. She made it sound like I was paranoid.

So the conclusion is that she's lying and definitely hiding something and she refuse to tell me what it is even when pressured. Despite all this I don't think she's cheating. Definitely going to keep an eye out for more suspicious behaviour. I'll have to try to forgive her and give her the chance to regain my trust.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_s7ucz,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/s7ucz/girlfriend_acting_weird_after_receiving_a_txt/,

You all probably know what it is if not read  this [Asperger syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome)

I've pretty much been a typical aspie kid my whole life, socially awkward and all of that kind of stuff. 

Anyways last year I managed to some how get a girlfriend by some miracle. For some reason this girl was one of the few people that I didn't get very awkward and anxious around. Everything just kind of clicked and we started going out and it was great. 

We had been going out for a year, but throughout that year she constantly complained about me not showing enough affection. Obviously being an aspie I don't deal with emotions or affection very well. I really have trouble with it, to the point where I don't even really understand how you show affection to another person. I guess I get the basic idea of it, but I really get confused. 

Even with my family we don't really share affection with each other. While growing up my parents rarely if ever even said things like I love you to me, so the entire concept of affection is very awkward and new to me. 

Over the past year these complaints kept building up to where she told me if I don't change something than we can't keep going out. We broke up about 3 weeks ago.

I guess the real problem that is I've never told her that I have Aspergers. In fact I generally try to avoid telling people at all, because I've found it just makes things more awkward than they already are. The few people I told about my Aspergers kind of started treating me like I'm retarded. I guess this is just a misunderstand of Aspergers on their part, but it really makes things weird. 

I really don't want to tell her though, because I'm afraid if I do she wont get back together with me. She wants me to change, but if I tell her I have Aspergers, that basically means I won't be suddenly becoming affectionate overnight.... no change = not getting back together

At the same time I feel like I have to because my aspergers is basically the direct cause of the problem. This has really been having an affect on my self-esteem and I've been depressed for like the past month. I stay up all night, don't get enough sleep. My grades are going to shit. I feel like everything is just spiraling out of control. Doesn't help that when we get in fights she tells me I'm weird and awkward and that if it wasn't for her I'd probably be alone for the rest of my life (which is sadly a real possibility).

Also sorry if I made any spelling or grammar mistakes or if anything just doesn't make sense. I've been awake for over 24 hours so I'm really out of it.

EDIT: Also the title should technically read Ex-Girlfriend...... 

EDIT2: I just realized posting all this stuff online is kind of embarrasing...  I don't really have friends to talk to about this kind of stuff though",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_r7trc,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/r7trc/my_girlfriend_cant_handle_my_aspergers/,

So we've spent a week and a half apart and pretty much incommunicado. We have spoken briefly about things like who's going to take care of walking our dog that afternoon, etc.

She had her first individual therapy session last night. She called me before she went and asked how I was doing. I said fine and spoke for a minute about her session coming up. She got kinda mad that I didn't ask how she was doing. I told her that I didn't know what to say or ask her right now because of how weird everything is. 

I did tell her I was worried about her. She said ""Why because I'm acting crazy and being like daddy?!?!"" I told her I didn't say that. Obviously that's in her head. I said I was worried about her because she is going through something right now and trying to figure out who she is. She didn't say much about that.

So anyway she went to her session. Afterward she called me to tell me that the therapist had changed the date of my session and our joint session. I asked her how it went. She just said it was fine. Didn't say anything else. So she told me she'd see me in the morning.

So this morning she comes in to get showered and ready for work. I asked her how she was doing and feeling and she said she was kinda sick and had been for a couple of days. I asked how her session went, and she said she didn't want to talk about that at 6:15 in the morning. I said yeah that's understandable.

So I've gotten ready for work and she's about ready to leave and I asked her if we could get dinner tonight or sometime this week and talk, and she said ""Actually, I'm going to stay here tonight. I'll sleep in the guest bed. I have an even earlier morning tomorrow and it'll make it easier. We will talk tonight about some ground rules and other things.""

I said ok.

So anyway, I'm not trying to read anything into this. It could mean anything or it could mean nothing, but at least she's comfortable with coming home, and is apparently willing to start talking.

We have been dating a little over a year and have been living together for about 7 months. Anyway, my boyfriend (22) told me that I am fat and he said I should work out. 

I have gained probably 10 pounds since I moved in with him because all he does is stay at home and play on the computer. I am also on medication that causes me to gain weight for a condition I have that I have to take otherwise I get really sick. All other medications for what I have also has the side effect of weight gain. 

I am on a diet of 1,200 calories a day. Sometimes I only eat 500 calories a day. I get a bit of exercise from my job since it requires walking back and forth around a big warehouse lifting and sorting heavy boxes for 9 hours a day. 

When I moved in with him I moved 3 hours away from friends and family, which I used to go on walks with all the time. I really enjoy walking but since my bf doesn't go out ever and refuses to go on walks because ""walking is boring"" I have put on a few pounds.

I don't really want to join a gym because I am poor and shy so I don't like working out in front of others. And I don't want to work out by myself (I like to talk to someone), and he wont come with me and all my friends are 3 hours away. I told him I will work out if he walks to the gym with me (like a 30 min walk)but he said no.

He has put on about 15 lbs (or more, he had to buy all new jeans cause he didn't fit into old ones) since I started dating him because he stopped working out and basically stopped trying because he told me ""I don't have to impress anyone"" he sometimes wont shower for 4-5 days..

I don't think I should have to try more than I am to lose weight since he isn't trying at all to improve himself or helping me out at all. I think I am fine the way I am, its just he sits and watches porn and compares me to the girls with huge boobs and tiny waists. Did I mention that he complains about my boobs? He says they are way too small and I should get surgery to enlarge them. I wear a 36C size, and cant afford surgery since I am a college student and can barely afford my share of rent.

A couple of weeks ago he confessed he had cheated on me during this time. I told him I loved him and appreciated his honesty, and that I understood his actions were probably motivated by the stress. I thought he would be relieved, but instead he now thinks I don't love him. He seems to think I should be mad at him / jealous because that would show I loved him. It's really confusing.

I'm not great with emotions / social relationships, so maybe I'm just missing something here. It just seems a little ridiculous.

**Update:** I've been reading all of the comments through the day, but I didn't really have much time to answer them all. I thought long and hard about what I was going to say when I saw him today. Long story short, we had a very long conversation about us and our relationship.

I told him that him cheating on me hurt me more than he could ever imagine, but that I couldn't just throw away all of our time together because of a mistake. He said that he understood that it was his fault, and that the reason he had been upset was because my reaction was not at all what he expected. He said that he had worked up the courage to confess and he had thought I would be angrier, but that me reacting calmly just made him disappointed, somehow (not his exact words).

We talked about other stuff for a while before reaching (what I think) the main issue in all of this is. He thinks that I am 'emotionally distant', and that it is sometimes hard to know what I'm feeling. He thinks I keep a wall around me and don't let other people in easily. I asked him if he wanted to break up, and he said no. I think he was honest, but it's hard to tell right now. He did say he wanted to try and make our relationship work, but that he thought we needed some time apart. He's staying the night with his sister, and we will talk again tomorrow.

This is one of the first nights I've spent alone in years. It's really weird.

I'm 23. I've dated a girl who had just broken up with her boyfriend. She seemed nice, but things moved too fast. We had only been dating for 3 weeks and it felt that she wanted me to replace her boyfriend already. We made the mistake of having sex too soon, and I broke things off after she got angry that I waited 2 days to ask for her number again after losing my phone.

My second relationship I'm not very proud of. I was that other guy. She was hardly in a happy relationship but I thought I actually loved her, when I think I was just very lonely. We never did anything, it was purely emotional but it still destroyed me mentally for about a year. Eventually her boyfriend found out and she ended up choosing him.

I learned about real love a few months after that. We met and were together for three years. I still love her, but for complicated reasons she doesn't want to be with me right now. I once heard that statistically people who accidentally kill people in car accidents are more likely to suffer depression than those who *know* they were at fault. I feel the same way, she said it wasn't my fault but it just makes me wonder what I could have done.

We've been apart for almost a year now and she's begun seeing other people. Now I'm focusing on my career, and trying to learn to be happy by myself.

My roommate Bob threw a pretty crazy house party Friday night.
Lots of people, lots of alcohol. Bob has a friend named Carolyn who comes out to our place pretty regularly (we have many people over pretty regularly). Bob and Carolyn have some history, I'm not really sure about all the details but I think they used to hook up. Carolyn is an attractive girl. She looks good and dresses pretty provacitve/slutty, especially at parties. Every time we have a party or a get together with alcohol, she is drunk and all over some dude who varies from party to party. Many of the females in our circle (my gf included) dislike her and call her a slut behind her back.

Anyway, during Bob's party, my girlfriend is out doing her own thing at a party with people from her job. Our party runs til like 5AM. At this point we have a few people who decided to crash on the floor/futons and just leave in the morning/whenever, Carolyn is one of them. I was pretty drunk and headed into my room before passing out instnatly in my bed. Next thing, I'm awake with the feeling of someone jerking me off, I knew shit was strange right away because I could feel acrylic nails on my dick (my girlfriend works in a lab so her fingers are always trimmed). I didn't know what to do. I felt really awkward and I feel embarassed to admit that I just pretend to be asleep. I know I'm an idiot, but I was really confused by the whole situation and my body felt heavy because of the alcohol. After what felt like a few minutes I guess she just passed out. I also passed out again a little while after. I didn't even know who it was until I woke up in the morning and saw her still passed out in my bed. Now more sober, I wake her up forcefully and say ""out of my room I cannot sleep with you in my bed"". She doesn't even respond she just gets up slowly and walks out. When I exited my room later that afternoon she was gone.

I don't know what to do. Do I tell Bob? Do I tell my gf? How do I explain this situation to her? Do I confront Carolyn? What would I say? I feel too embarassed to do anything. I need advice.

tldr A drunk girl entered my room and grabbed my dick while I was sleeping... wtf.




**edit:**
Thanks for the advice everyone, it has reaffirmed my thinking.

Seems like no matter what happens I'll feel best about this if I just tell my gf, I've already told Bob. 
Some of you have mentioned that this story may emerge in a different light,  which is my main fear since rumor gets around about this girl *constantly*. I should have mentioned in my OP that Bob has a fucking fiber optic connection into the details of her sex life and is in broadcast mode all day, her behavior is the subject of much discussion and shit talk, making Bob a big reason why most of the ladies in our group have such a visceral disgust for her. 

When I talked to Bob he seemed to take my story for truth and even mentioned how earlier in the night she was crotch grinding another dude who was passed out on the futon. In all honesty, the act itself didn't really effect me,  the whole event seems semi-forgettable, but I'm seriously angry that I am now left with the ultimatum of making my girlfriend feel like shit or risk destroying our relationship altogether if she doesn't hear it from me first. My girlfriend is a rational lady, but Carolyn and her direct associates have such a negative stigma in our group that I'm afraid that when I tell her she may harbor a secret embarrassment due to Carolyn's notoriety. Cops are out of the question, where I live, I'd very realistically be laughed out of the precinct, maybe with a fine for thinking they gave a fuck (sorry, I've had several unpleasant experiences with douche police men).

Last night I was having a drink with my GF of nearly three years. She is 32 I am 27. We were talking about all kinds of things, and ultimately the relationship became the topic of conversation.

About 5 months ago I moved back to the same city as her. Before that, we had been in a long distance relationship for almost a year. I went away for a job but we stayed together when I left, and were obviously together when I came back home.

So we are talking about the relationship, and our personal goals in careers etc. I asked her if she ever felt like the relationship was sorta holding her back from moving forward with some of her goals. She said yes and I agreed with her. At this point I wasn't looking to break up, we were just having a really honest conversation. I told her some things about how I felt while I was away. How she treated me poorly and how I was pretty convinced she was sleeping with or had slept with someone else.

So I asked her straight up ""Did you sleep with anyone?"" She casually said ""Yes, I did"". At that point my stomach dropped. I had strongly suspected this and had even come to terms with it in my own head but hearing the words from her was just.. painful.

It was also her delivery. She was very casual about it. She made it seem like it was no big deal. Like it was ""just sex"" and a ""one time thing"".

I ask for details. Who was it, where, when etc? She said she met the guy at a party one night. I said ""did you go home with him or did he come over to your place?"" I was absolutely heart broken when she said ""It didn't happen that night, it happened later."" She says this even after telling me that she told him she had a boyfriend. 

It is also worth mentioning that when she did this, I had already made firm plans to come back to her city. We had a date set when I'd be back and everything and talked about me coming back. Also worth mentioning that I asked her if she ever planned on telling me this and she said ""No, it didnt seem 'productive'"". Not. Even. Sure. What. That. Means. Oo

She said things like ""I needed this"" and ""I don't understand why it matters to you."" All these things kill me when I think about them. I loved this woman. I thought about what it'd be like to marry her, to have kids with her, and now I feel stupid. I feel deceived, alone, and just naive about the whole thing.

EDIT: I want to add here what she said in response to me bringing up my thoughts on this relationship being really long term. She said she started to think about all those things after she did this and cut the guy off. I've been meditating on the whole thing today, and this just seals it for me that this is over. She needed a fling, one time or otherwise, to realize she wants to be with me and take me seriously? Talk about a stinger. Communicating with me about it would have been the better route, I think.

Ultimately, I left the bar. I told her I'd be a damn fool if I walked out of there still in a relationship with her. So I did that, I walked out and told her we were fucking done.

Build me up reddit, I'm feeling really blue today and could use some good advice.

TL;DR - GF of three years told me she cheated, I left, I hurt.

UPDATE: Thank you for the advice everyone. Saturday was a rough day for me. Late Sat night she called me and left a voicemail that said she really wanted to talk about things, whether that leads it to ending or fixing this. She then sent me an email about a half hour later saying how much she regretted what she did, how she loves me, how she wants to fix this because I'm so important to her, her best friend, etc.

I'm feeling conflicting emotions bc of this. I know this is what was going to happen, her asking for another chance. I don't know what to do. I feel partly I should stay strong and just be alone for a while to figure some things out. But I feel partly that I should at least hear what she has to say and try and gain some more perception on the situation. I feel if I do that I may end up feeling weak and will try to forgive her and take her back.

Before I go on, let me thank you all for all the excellent advice. Secondly, things went very well-as per your orders, I didn't f*ck anything up, LordPotato. Now, to answer a few questions that came up in the last thread.

Several people thought I live in Japan. Me and Fujiko live in New York. She's half Japanese, only her father is full Japanese. I'm an American mutt. I have been to Tokyo with Fujiko once though, and yes, you really do have to watch yourself on the subways if you are a woman. They also have a lot of very weird game shows. Someone also seemed to think that Asian women were ugly. To each his own, but Fujiko honestly looks a lot like a [younger version of this.](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HKkc8LVCxA0/S8gf5cBjBMI/AAAAAAAABpA/Kh3cbZ6PO3c/s1600/maria-ozawa01.jpg) (Don't ask for an actual pic please. I respect her privacy online. She's not even on Facebook because of privacy concerns.) I'm a little surprised so many people thought I was trolling in my post-a lot of people seemed to think I had nothing better to do at 3:00 AM than to troll reddit. Personally, I would have rather have been sleeping!

So, on Saturday evening, Fujiko got off work, and I went over to see her. We went up to her room, and I sat her down and said, ""We need to talk."" So that's what we did.

I told her that firstly I was worried about how she was going straight from her father's house to me almost immediately, with very little growth between, and that I worried she might not be developing fully as a woman. She believed that was not as major an issue as I thought, because after her Dad almost died, he had given her the reigns to her life. Basically, since she was 15, she's been increasingly paying her way for as much as possible while still doing well in school, and she's not overly close to him-he's more like a good friend than a father to her now.

A related worry we discussed was that in college, free from her father, she might go a bit crazy. Her response was that she felt that many people who go crazy in college only hurt themselves later in life and that they were best avoided, and that she wants to get into dental school far more than she wants to spend time with ""people who place short term fun over long term gain."" I asked ""What if I become one of those people who place fun over gain?"" She said that she knew that I would not, and honestly, she's right-I've spent too long struggling in school to flush dental school down the toilet. She also added that as a wife, she looked forward to growing with me, no matter what direction that went, even if in the end, it meant changing our dream careers.

I told her that in college, we might want to date other people. She told me that she was completely and entirely certain that she did not want to date anyone else. I told her that I understood if she changed her mind on that later on, and then asked what she would do if I wanted to date others. She said that if that was necessary to put my mind at ease, that she was okay with it. (On a personal note, I don't think I would ever want to date anyone else. I've wanted Fujiko for as long as I can remember!) I told her I was worried that if we separated, it would automatically be my fault, because she was so sure she could make it work. She replied that she would be certain it was her fault, since she can sometimes be very cold and emotionless.

I then told her that I wasn't comfortable with a marriage that was a business partnership. She replied that any marriage that lasts is a business partnership in the first place, uniting the resources of two ""corporations"" into one to push ahead for mutual gain. She pointed out again that statistically, most of the world's marriages are goal based (arranged/contractual/Asian/African) versus love based (American/some European), and that goal based marriages had a far higher rate of success. Then her voice changed. If you knew her, you would know what I mean, but usually, she has a very matter-of-fact way of saying things. That matter-of-factness was suddenly gone, and it threw me for a loop. She said, ""UtterlyConfusionated, you always worry too much about me. You've always tried to do what was best for me. I love you very much as a friend, and while I may not love you as a husband right now, our marriage won't be loveless. I've known for a long time that I could love you romantically very, very easily, but I didn't say anything before.""

I asked her why.

She replied, ""I didn't want to take away your dreams. I didn't tell you what my career choice was or what school I wanted to go to until after you knew your own choices because I know you love me as more than a friend. I knew that if I told you what I had wanted, you would choose your life to suit me. I wanted you to choose what you wanted for yourself, and to be happy for yourself before I thought to make myself happy. So when I knew you had chosen a life that would make you happy, and that my dreams didn't require you to change yours, I knew I could finally tell you how I felt.""

Then she went back to her usual voice, saying ""Logically, our worst case scenario is that we go back to being friends. You aren't going to stab me in the back and I'm not going to do the same to you. And I know what I want. I want to be your wife, I know you want it too, and we can make it work. It's a good business move, and it will work out perfectly academically and romantically. We're not even making it legally official until we graduate college. But as far as I'm concerned, I'm your wife and you are my husband. Let's give it a try.""

So I said we would. You can use your imagination to fill in what happened next and for most of Sunday. Suffice to say, nothing was held back. And you know what? I think this is actually going to work!

Thank you all for your advice, Reddit. This is an awesome community, and you all raised some excellent points.

1264613796.0,58,self.relationship_advice,auubf,Last week my inner man raptor awoke - here's an update,enriched_humanium,72,14,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/auubf/last_week_my_inner_man_raptor_awoke_heres_an/,"This is an update to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aryuc/today_my_inner_man_raptor_awoke_i_asked_her_out/).

We had our first date! 

There is a really great restaurant the next town over that I've been to a few times but that she had only heard about and was very interested in going to so that's where we decided to have dinner on Saturday night.

Needless to say I was pretty nervous (and I had to work that day early in the morning so I was kind of tired too). I did buy her a really cool lollipop (flowers just didn't seem right - I know her well enough to know that much) and gave it to her when I arrived at her apartment. 

She looked beautiful too. She had painted her nails to match her outfit and though she isn't a make-up wearing type of girl, she had just a little but on with some glittery type stuff (I have no idea what its called) that when the light reflected off of her made her sparkle. Like I said, she was beautiful.

We are both pretty casual but I did but a new sweater and some nice jeans, got a hair trim and cleaned my car real well (vacuum and a new air freshener). 

I sort of got lost looking for her place but was maybe 5 minutes late and she was looking for me anyway. She invited me up to see her place and meet her dog before we left. Funny thing was, I knew I was would eventually meet her dog and was a little bervous about that too - I mean, what if the dig hated me? You know how dogs are (I love dogs by the way) but he was very friendly and he let me rub his belly. It was cute.

I suppose the thing people are most worried about on a date is that they won't have anything to talk about but we had no trouble chatting and laughing as we drove to the restaurant. By the way, I made sure to be a gentleman and open the car door for her and hold all the doors for her too. I know that seems oddly formal and old fashioned but I liked being the gentleman and I would imagine most woman like the effort too.

I suppose the most difficult part of the date for me was some basic interaction stuff. Sometimes she would hold her gaze at me a bit longer than you would with just a friend and I kept thinking ""Oh, God, she's looking at me, what do I do? Do I stare back at her? How long do I gaze into her eyes? Oh, man, she's beautiful ..."". 

It wasn't that she made me uncomfortable - just the opposite really, it's just that I'm not used to the flirting and self confidence is still something I'm improving so sometimes my eyes would hold the gaze for a bit then dart away. Yeah, I felt silly doing that too, but as the night wore on I got better. I mean, I wanted to make that connection with her too, I'm just badly out of practice.

But we had a great time anyway. We talked and laughed and told all of our crazy, fun stories. She really wants to start her own business so we talked about that for awhile too. That was actually the easiest part because it just felt natural - like two people just talking with no pressure or anything. I really liked that.

When we were done with dinner the check came and she made the move to pay for her part but I said I'd really like to be the gentleman and pay for both of ours so she offered to leave the tip and that felt right so that's how we handled that. I know sometimes this can be a big deal for some people but that's how we did it and that was fine for both of us. 

One thing I did notice, though, was that she seemed really nervous as dinner was winding down. Well, I don't know if ""nervous"" is the right word but she was playing with her hair a lot and kinda rocking back and forth and being kind of fidgety. I wasn't sure how to read that. I mean, she still wanted to be there because we were still working on desert (we split a cheesecake slice) and she wasn't acting bored, she was just doing the stuff I guess maybe girls do when they are nervous but like someone too? 

I guess my lack of experience here is probably evident but I didn't get any bad vibes or anything - I just didn't know how to read the situation except that she's not used to dating either (I'm not sure if she's had a boyfriend before or had dated much either) so she might have been nervous how the date would end or something? I don't know. 

So I drove her back home and though I would have been very happy to do something else, it was kind of late by then. I didn't get the impression that she wanted to just ""end the evening"" I just think she was a little out of her element too. In the ride home she kept fidgeting with her fingers on something (maybe her nails) but I didn't put any pressure on anything. We were still chatting up a storm and laughing and genuinely having a great time. 

So I dropped her off - sorry, no kisses this evening :) I didn't even try to go there either, I just told her I wad a great time and she did too.

Anyway, things really did seem to go great. I know I made kind of a big deal about her possibly being nervous but I was just not sure how to read that. Everything else was amazing. We really had fun and I was feeling on top of the world. I mean, I never felt so good in ... well, I don't know how long. 

So that was on Saturday. On Sunday at work I was still feeling that ""high"" but was kinda wondering ""so, what next? What do I do now?"" 

Well now it's Wednesday and I had not seen her since Saturday, but today at work she asked me to go out to a movie this week. 

I'll take that as a good sign :)

OK. sorry this ran so long. I guess I really don't have a point here (except to wonder about some body language stuff) but I wanted to follow up with everyone from my last post and thought this would make a nice record of a fledgling relationship or at least how a date can go when one is nervous and inexperienced and still working on birthing that raptor :) ",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_auubf,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/auubf/last_week_my_inner_man_raptor_awoke_heres_an/,
1375286934.0,55,self.relationship_advice,1jffer,I (m/37) recently found out my wife of two weeks (f/29) was a real ‘party girl’,desperatehouseguy,98,43,303,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jffer/i_m37_recently_found_out_my_wife_of_two_weeks_f29/,"Ok, I know this is really screwed up, but it was a whirlwind romance, that got me to say I do in around four months.  I’ve left the continent to be with her on the other side of the world.  Up until a few days ago everything was fine, until I decided to fix her computer.

Then I found pictures of her engaged in group sex, mmf,mff,mmmmf type stuff.  If that wasn’t shocking enough I then checked her cellphone to find out that she regularly used adult friend finder, and had dozens of hook-ups right up until we met.

The plus is that she hasn’t bothered with any of that once we’ve been together which is fine.  I get that she had her own life, but then there was the other bomb.

Just after our wedding she started to shout out some other dudes name while we were having sex.  She invited this guy to the wedding.  Going back to her phone logs she had an EIGHT YEAR relationship with this guy.

I confronted her on it, and she said that it was purely physical that he would ignore her for months at a time and he was too old.  And of course that he was leaving the area for a long time so he doesn’t matter.

I can’t even begin to tell you just how much rage that unleashed in me, over the jealousy and feeling of betrayal over this.  I’ve told her about this, and how I really want her to have no further contact with him ever again.  I was going to phone him to reiterate this, but I fear I don’t trust myself to do so in a clear and sane manner without giving death threats.

The two things that keep racing through my mind is that she never told me about all the group sex (which I’m not cool with nor the long term relationship that seemingly can start again at any moment.  

Worse to me is that this country is all new, and I don’t speak the language so it just feels like it encourages her to play the field and I’m the clueless ‘house wife’ who just cooks and cleans.  It bothers me that the local population has a long tradition of screwing around with prostitutes and the like.

I’m going to lose a LOT of face if I try to leave as I went through hell to be here with her.

I just keep feeling like an idiot as it is clear that once she realized the eight year guy wasn’t going to have anything to do with her in any serious manner she then found me and lured me in; and that as soon as he returns she’ll do anything/everything to hookup with him again.

It really troubles me when she says that for the last eight years she wasn’t in any relationship because she gave up on love, but it turns out she was in a long term thing with one guy for the duration, and had dozens of flings.

The worst thing is now I don’t trust her.

TL;DR fell in love, got married too quick.  I accidentally found out about my wife’s wild past and really don’t know what to do.

update

Ok we talked at length tonight about the eight year guy, why the whole thing bothers me and so on.  She has agreed to have no further contact with him.  And she showed me her phone/email and she has infact had zero communication with him since she invited him to the wedding.  She does see now why inviting him was wildly inappropriate.

We are on our late twenties. We have two kids under 4. He does not do anything besides getting milk or something else that is missing and throwing the garbage which he barely manages and the trash can gets spilled all over because he doesnt close the small bags that goes on the big black one and I have to pick up after him.

In fact I have to pick after him all the time because he wont even put his plate to wash after hes done eating. I have a lot of things to do as part of our routine and the kids and I am getting not just tired, but angry towards him. I have very unhealthy urges lately of slapping him in the face when he gets home and says hurtful and demeaning things and is just constantly. Yesterday I complained about the fact I was busting my ass making a nice dinner for everyone and that he could just help around a bit instead of just sit down and do whatever he feels like and he told me he was working all day while I was certainly able to relax a bit. And that is nice compared to things he tell me sometimes. The kids have crazy high energy all day and I have to clean dishes, cook, do laundry, clean bathroom, swipe floor etc on a daily basis. It gets messy everyday being a family of four. And not to mention toys all over the place. 

We have been together for 6 years almost and he have never cooked a nice meal for me, not even once. And when he washes the dishes, which is rarely (once every 2 months) he leaves everything greasy as if on purpose just to make sure I dont ask again. I avoid at all costs asking him because he behaves so aggressively when he has to do anything and starts taking out on everyone that I don't even bother anymore.

To top it all it feels like he is stuck on time and do juvenile things that are demeaning like start inappropriate texting with female co-workers, put me on speaker while we are talking and he is at the cafeteria at his work so his friends can hear me (normal talking, especially when im saying i love you too or something). He treats this as if I am uptight while I feel he is just plenty disrespectful and cynical about it all because he just does not care and does not take things seriously at all in general. I dont know what to do with him anymore, yesterday I got it all off my chest and spoke to him after dinner but he looks just cynical all the way and says he is sorry and that he will try to do his best but it just does not legitimate at all. As a matter of fact I think he is just cold, proud and inconsiderate person who do whatever pleases him and takes me for granted because he simply does not care. I feel like a maid and am about to stop doing anything around and just get my purse and car keys and leave when he arrives. 

I wish I have married someone else. I am always exhausted and just frustrated and feels so unappreciated. I am too young to feel this way, is there anything I could do to try to make him see what is like to be on my shoes? How to make him realize how hard it is to keep doing everything by myself?! 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: Thanks everyone, but just to make clear I have not said I am using the word divorce. I do no threat him and when I left the other time was for some time with my parents and amicably, it was not officially separated and we were in touch constantly. Now when I say I might stay away for a few days (I was thinking over a weekend) I mean in the nicest way and we will sit down and he will have to agree with that, I wont just leave for a few days without his consentment to stay with the kids. I dont want to force him to experience this if he does not want to, the whole point is that, he needs to want to change otherwise it just wont last long. And is about a constant effort from both of us because thats what it takes to make a marriage happy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EDIT: (He works in an office.)
*** I want to thank you all so much for all the personal advice. I really appreciate the care. Its nice to see is not that different for everyone and that its really about contribution. But I do believe that the main problem here is communication in the first place. Today when he arrived he had a proactive attitude and it was so very refreshing. I asked him if he was okay and he said he thought hard about what I said during the day. He seemed very honest and kind of alert as if acknowledged my side. I asked him if he wanted to talk about it and he said that he knows what he needs to do and that he is aware he was getting away with it and I asked him so why today and he said I will do this as long as I have to because its only fair. We will take baby steps, one at a time and therapy will be required so we can work our issues but I was relieved to see the slightest spark of genuine care and self awareness as if the message came across him this time around. I enabled him to be this way and now its about consistency from both of us and its starting today while we might be able to fix and be not too late. I do not have divorce seriously in mind and neither does he, so we will stick together and are talking about organizing divided agenda with plenty for both and keep track on a calendar of extra activities for the family.

I'm completely unsure how to react.,rlh1271,73,15,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fceq2/24m_my_girlfriend_22f_wants_a_threesome_with/,"We've been dating for a few months. She's a super awesome girl, smart, active, sexy, considerate... All good traits, I have no complaints there. Yesterday we were snuggled on the couch watching a tv show about the oceans, and she out of the deep blue asked what I would think about a threesome. I was stunned for a few seconds. She works as a yoga instructor, and I know she is constantly getting hit on by guys in her classes, so at first I thought she was talking about one involving two guys. When I asked she looked perplexed for a second and then said: No! I was thinking with one of my old co-workers at [redacted] She's really cute! This is probably a good time to mention she's bisexual. She's fooled around with this girl in the past (which is fine, I don't really care about sexual history's) and as far as I know she's remained committed while dating me. 

I guess my question to you guys is why she'd be interested in something like this? I've said anything suggesting that I'd be interested in a threesome. Never expressed interested in other girls in general actually. I knew she liked girls going into this, I just never expected her to request we share our bed with one. She and I aren't really the jealous type so I don't really foresee a problem there, so long as we're both involved in the act. I guess my main concern would be her asking me to reciprocate ie. by inviting another guy to join us. That I would not be okay with. I asked her about that and she told me she knows I'm not attracted to guys, why would she ask me to have sex with one? That the only reason she wants to invite a girl is because we would both be attracted to her. 

I like to think I'm pretty sexually open. The idea of bringing in another girl in sounds hot in theory, but is it meant to be something that we only play out in fantasy's? I'm totally satisfied with our sex life, would saying yes only invite problems in to an otherwise awesome relationship? Am I too white bread? Am I over-thinking this? You tell me reddit.

In order to move in with me she quit her job and moved to a new city away from her family and friends. However, for various reasons (which I can elaborate on if people think it's important) I think we need to just cut ties and break up. Perhaps the most important reason for this is that I feel as though I don't love her (and perhaps I never did).

Since moving in with me I have essentially supported her. For the last year I have paid 100% of the rent and about 80% of the utilities in the apartment. She also uses my car (which I make payments on as well as insurance) and I have paid the vast majority of the food, entertainment, etc costs. Because of the frustration related to paying for almost everything, I do almost no cleaning or cooking.

For a year she has been unemployed, though I would argue that she really isn't trying. I have given up on even asking if she's looking for work because it just turns into an argument that I'd rather not have. Ironically, I continue to buy her little gifts here and there, but my rationale behind that is I'm trying to keep her somewhat happy so I don't come home to a complete shitshow every night after I'm done with work.

Both of our names are on the apartment lease, which has another year on it. I am financially stable, but I don't think I could handle paying for this apartment AND another place, but I also don't think we could cohabitate after a breakup.

To make matters worse, she's essentially broke and has started to build up what appears to be a lot of debt (in addition to student loans). I recently came across a letter from a credit card company saying they were cutting off her card because of lack of payment and I've started to receive collection calls on her behalf.

So, I have a girlfriend I don't love, who lives in a city where she knows almost no one, has no job, no money and no prospects for improvement.

He is the sweetest, most loving man I have ever met. In December I began to get sick and it escalated from there. In January I found out that I had an 8 inch tumor coming out of my ovary. In February I began undergoing tests, including an endometrial biopsy (those results came back negative). The ovary was removed and we discovered that it had become the size of a basketball. They biopsied that and it came back that I have a rare type of cancer called Borderline Ovarian Cancer, which apparently means that while I have cancer it can't decide if it wants to be malignant or benign. Every few moths I have to see my oncologist to make sure the cancer has not started to spread. If it does then I will have to undergo chemo and/or a hysterectomy.


I have been having a hard time dealing with this, I am now much more emotional than I was and cry easily. Part of it is the uncertainty of my situation. It could be three years before anything happens. Or fifteen. Or never. My life has become a waiting game. My boy friend and I have been coping with this by making light of the situation and joking about it. So far he has put on a strong front but finally confessed to me last night that he is, in fact, scared. I'm worried that the fact that I have cancer is going to push him away despite him stating rather sternly that he is in it for the long haul. While I was in the hospital he did not leave my side once and slept on a small couch for five days. That should say something but I have become over run with insecurities and I am just terrified of losing him. We both want children and now there's the possibility of me requiring a hysterectomy before we've had any. And I have lost my train of thought so I will end it there.


What can we do to cope with this situation and how can I stop letting my new insecurities run my life?

1. She forced my baby brother to eat his own poop when he was 3.   

2. She was in an abusive relationship with a man for 13 years and blamed their relationship on us kids. Always saying ""if it weren't for you kids, I would leave him. I wouldn't be with him if it wasn't for you.""   

3. She cheats, a lot. She cheated on my bio dad 3 times, my ex step dad twice,  and her current boyfriend once, they've been dating for a year. And these are only what has been confirmed because she got caught.   

4. She has never done anything wrong. When confronted, she shifts blame. She always plays victim.   

5. She's constantly creating drama. When you tell her you don't want to be a part of it, she goes ballistic.  

6. She manipulates you into feeling bad so she can get what she wants. I can't tell you how many times I've heard ""after all I've done for you!?""  

7. She cares more about her reputation than other people's feelings.   

8. She lies. There are always 3 different stories to whatever drama she's created. She's always the victim.  

9. She doesn't work for anything she has. It seems like she makes people feel bad for her so she can get what she wants.  

10. When confronted, she will often laugh manically and reply with ""you're so silly. You make me laugh. Lol"" even though the issue at hand is very serious.

I raised my concerns. Told her what you guys have been telling me from what information you had and then we talked some more.   
I promised myself and her that I will not give up on us as long as I love her and because I still do I am taking all of your advice and comments (until the part where I dump her) and give us a trial run.   
She has acknowledged every issue and agrees with you guys about her being inconsiderate and has apologised. Now here is what I came up with for a plan so far: This week we tell each other what we dislike about each others behaviour, followed by something nice and encouraging. For example: ""I hate your drinking (followed by explanation on why it's bad and why I hate it), but you have been attentive and listened to every word I said and agreed, all you have to do now is follow it through"". After that hold on to each other until new years to see how we're progressing. 
All in all we are gonna give it all from both sides (She mentioned that I'm becoming lazy and I agree with her, so I'll try and improve on my energy levels) for the next month. After that have the big talk again and see where we're going. We are great together, we do love each other, and if she follows through with her word then we are going to have a lot of fun together.**
  
  
**Thank you guys for advice, I read every comment and it raised a lot of questions in me and slowly but surely we are both going to go through the issues and sort this out. We are both willing, so that's a start... right? I mean it's easy to give up, in the end what do I have to lose by trying? If I don't try, then I'm losing the will to fight for something I care for and possibly something very special to me...**  
  
  
My girlfriend of just over 1 year just told me that she ""can't be bothered getting in the mood"".   
  
She knows that I would sometimes have to go and masturbate just to relieve myself and she is completely fine with it, because we don't have to have sex.  
  
When she is drunk - sex is a must! There is no way out of it for me. If I say no, she'll start saying stuff like ""You're a dick"", ""Stop being a pussy"", ""I'm letting you fuck me!"" and it sucks to hear, because that is not who she is... She's a sweet girl who hates cursing. So when drink is involved she changes drastically.  
  
Generally when I start complaining we have 2-4 days where we have sex every time we meet. After that there's always some sort of excuse to avoid any intimacy involving nakedness.  
  
Today I tried to talk to her about it and she kept asking if I am breaking up with her, which is definitely not what I want. I love her and I'm extremely attracted to her, all I want is to have sex more than twice a month.  
  
Last thing: what really hit me was that a few days ago she had her usual drunken horny mode on and I started playing with her, she never - ever orgasms when she's drunk. Because I was extremely tired I told her that I need to get some sleep and I promise that I will make it up to you in the morning... Her response was ""If you won't wanna do it, I may as well go find someone else who will."" - after this I left the room and went to sleep in the kitchen (student house). Last night she was meant to come home at 1am, but came back falling all over the place, drunk, at 5-6am.   
  
Sorry for the long post. This is basically what I told her this morning as well, so she knows it all. I just don't know what to do. I know that if we start being intimate with each other, nothing can stand between us. But that's not happening and I'm starting to have my doubts that we are not sexually compatible, although I do love her very much!  
  
Can someone give me some advice on what I can do to fix this? I don't want to lose her, but if it comes to it, I better do it fighting for us!  
  
  
**TL;DR: Going out for over a year, sex fallen to barely twice a month(Mainly because she is drunk and wants to be fucked). Love her to bits, but having doubts if we are sexually compatible, which might destroy our relationship down the line. Need advice how to fix this, please?**

I'm 28 and she's 30.

Yeah, that's kind of confusing but I'll explain. My wife has very few actual interests or hobbies, if any. Basically, she doesn't consume information or learn about anything on purpose, and she doesn't spend time doing anything other than Facebook or TV (too often with 16 and pregnant junk). She dislikes documentaries and has opinions on things that she admittedly has never researched (like weed being completely evil).

I always try to spark conversation about current news or something I learned recently and she's somewhat receptive but generally disinterested. I'll even pose questions to her so we can discuss interesting topics, and she never ever has any kind of answer as if she has no knowledge on anything beyond typical common sense. I can't understand how someone can not be curious about the world and life in general.

For the record, I love my wife very much and, while this issue does confuse me and somewhat bother me, it's not a deal breaker with our relationship and I have no desire to leave her.

Is this common? Do people stay like this forever, or do they eventually snap out of it? I feel like I'm constantly learning about something, or philosophizing about the meaning of life, and questioning my own opinions on boundaries, but this seems to just not exist within her character. Can anyone make sense of it for me?

The other night however, I feel my privacy was invaded. I had fallen asleep around midnight the other night. I always close my door at night to sleep, and sometime after, I was partially woken up by the sound of my door closing. I then heard one of my roommates say something along the lines of ""I can't believe you actually did that.""

Skip to the next morning , I am getting ready for class and go to put my makeup on. I notice the small jar that I keep on a shelf in my room containing all of mine and my boyfriends condoms, not to mention a very personal belonging (my vibrator) is missing. I know right away it has to be my two roommates who are sleeping together who have taken it. I go to the boys room and they are in bed together, awake. I ask them if they took my jar, they say no. I leave and go to my other roommates room, and ask her. She admits that she took it last night while I was sleeping to give to the other two roommates because they didn't have condoms and wanted to have sex.

At this point I go back to the boys room and tell them I know they have it, and they direct me to where it is in their room. 

I am mad at all of these people, but at least the girl who took the jar for the other two came to me and apologized and to talk about it. The other two have not, and are acting like I am overreacting. Reddit please tell me if I'm taking this too far.

**EDIT**: Should probably also add I am a whimp when it comes to confronting people...I confronted the boy about it and he basically took no responsibility since he said the jar was just in his room when he got there, and did not apologize. This all has made me feel sick to my stomach. Yes, I hate confrontation that much.
**TL;DR** A roommate came into my room while I was sleeping, stole my jar of condoms to give to my other two roommates who wanted to have sex. Roommate who took it has apologized but the other two are avoiding me. ADVICE PLEASE.

**UPDATE**: Well, I basically just got told I overreacted and had no reason to be so upset and that I shouldn't have cared and two of my best friends basically just tore me a new one.

Bear with me, please. 
I've dated her(heretofore known as Mary) for about a year and a half. I read her text messages. A huge invasion of privacy, yes. I told her after I did it, not that it makes anything better. I did so because I started to suspect she was cheating on me(Mary said she never would). 
What led me to this conclusion was her habit of telling always saying she's ""going out with her girls"" or people from her department at our university and then, when recounting her evening, mentioning a male friend(we'll call him Josh) she used to hook up with. Now, this isn't normally an issue, but again, a pattern: Mary will invite me when it really is just the girls, but I've only once managed to catch Josh at one of their outings, and he left shortly after at that. 
Furthermore, sometimes she'll call me crying about how Josh was a dick to her when she's supposedly been ""out with the girls"". I go and comfort her, ask her what's what and just generally ameliorate the situation. 
All their texts are flirty. Mary says that's just the way he is with ladies.
Between her always cutting me out when he's around and making excuses for his flirty behavior, I'm having a hard time convincing myself this is a relationship I should continue. 
We have an on again off again relationship. 
One night recently she took a friend of mine and one of his buddies home, promising to come back and give me a ride home, too. Wouldn't answer her phone or texts until finally she picked up, blurted out ""I'm with *friend who is a girl's name*, can't talk!"" and hung up. Didn't see or hear from her until she came and crawled into bed with me the next morning. She denied sleeping with either of them, but man, I'm thinking this seals it.

TL;DR
suspected my girlfriend of cheating because of her habit of keeping me away when an old hook up is around, read her text messages and confronted her, was pretty much patted on the head and told to calm down like a child. Also, takes my friends home from the bar and rejects calls/texts. Denies having strange D inside her. WHUT?!

Would appreciate insight from both genders.  And yes, this is a throwaway account :(

(Tried to make this shorter but failed--sorry)

We are both 24, fit almost perfectly together (except this one issue) and have been dating for a year.

Girlfriend and I met on World of Warcraft.  We were both in places in our lives where we lived with parents, had not-so-great jobs, and had just gotten out of college.  Well, we found each other and we became great friends quickly.  Then after a few months we wanted to meet up and, to wrap up this part, we are now living together as boyfriend and girlfriend.

The reason we were able to move out and get our lives rolling is because I got a pretty good job offer and took it.  I got an apartment and she moved in while I set her up with a job (convenience store cashier) in my area. 

The problem?  I played WoW as a hobby because I had nothing better to do.  Crap job and lived in a pretty boring place with no girlfriend.  She played more for the social aspect and the smaller novelty things.  It was my understanding that we could pursue our real passions once we were free from our parents' homes.  She loves to paint, read, etc.  I have similar hobbies.

Well, now I work long hours and don't have much free time, but when I do, I read and write, etc.  The hours that she has at the apartment without me there, she spends playing World of Warcraft and cooking.  Don't get me wrong, I love that she cares enough to cook and spends a decent amount of time on it... but...

She has applied to two jobs in 6 months and has almost no motivation.  She owes me quite a bit of rent which I was happy to cover when she was getting situated.  I now feel, however, that she should start paying me back, as arranged, and MORE IMPORTANTLY get into the passions she used to spend all day talking about over the internet.  She hasn't painted anything.  Hasn't read a single book.  I bought her some neat artist supplies to pique and renew her interests outside of the game... she barely used them.  

It was my understanding that she would move past this infamous time-consuming game and get on with her life.  I know I did once I moved out and whatnot.

Am I asking too much?  She already cooks and loves me... but I find her lack of motivation absolutely aggravating.  World of Warcraft is her hobby, but am I wrong to want to deny her that?  Create an ultimatum?  

I need to know if I should talk to her tonight about how much it bothers me that she spends time every day playing while I'm working--and, in my opinion, should be using that time researching and applying for jobs or, god forbid, doing something more...adult?  Interesting?  Cultured?

PLEASE give me your thoughts and input.  I will respond when I can (I'm at work) and will answer any questions you have that will help clear up the situation.

Maybe I'm being ridiculous, and in that case, someone should tell me so.

Thank you.

*Edit -- Just got back from a busy stretch at work.  Really happy with the advice from all of you guys.  It's nice to know there's a place to turn to with good, honest, and unbiased opinions. 

**Edit -- Just arrived at home and have been checking everything out.  I think the only thing to note is that there is some talk of depression.  She definitely started playing WoW to hang out with her then-boyfriend and some other friends that were ""hooked"".  This is about the time she stopped all of the abovementioned hobbies such as painting, etc.  In my opinion, I don't think she's depressed... at least not for the vast majority of all things considered.  Quite simply, I think she got wrapped up in it for her own reasons(?)

About to have the talk... Wish me luck!  I'll post back tonight or tomorrow with results in case some of you were wondering what the outcome might be.  That said, thank you for all of your kind support.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_m7du1,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/m7du1/help_girlfriend_stuck_on_world_of_warcraft/,

My husband has let himself go somewhat, and it's gotten to the point recently that we realized he has hit 200 lbs. (he's just under 6' tall...maybe 5'11""). I'm about the same height (I'll say 5'9"" and some change) and weigh about 135 lbs. 

I exercise daily, commuting to work on my bike (about a 12 mile round-trip) and where ever else I can take it. I am diligent about keeping up with it, and it's a habit now that I really enjoy. It keeps me in great shape and helps with my mood, as long as I'm sure to replace all the calories I burn (which can be difficult). I've also started doing yoga at home and will be attending classes on Sundays (they're free).

I take pride in caring for my appearance, and have even taken up nude modeling for photography and life drawing classes to keep myself active with hobbies and to make new friends.

I know my husband is self-conscious about his body. He's told me many times he only feels ""safe and secure"" around me when it comes to nudity (he enjoys being nude and is so around the house often); He says he knows I love his body no matter what (which is true) so he feels comfortable. I wanted to get some photos done with him and he refused, due to his appearance.

He has said many times he wants to get up early, exercise, and keep a better diet (less fattening foods, smaller portions, less alcohol), but never has kept up with it for more than a day or two. I try to get him to bike with me, but by the end instead of feeling upbeat and having a sense of accomplishment, he seems to be cross (probably from exhaustion). 

He works out with a co-worker a couple times a week (I think) over his lunch break, but it's not enough to start the fat-burning process in his body. He replaces everything he loses with his food choices and beer. 

This has made it harder for me to feel sexually attracted to him. His lack of motivation to get into shape has made more of a mental impact than his actual appearance. 

TL;DR/Question: what is the best way to start a discussion with your spouse about their weight, diet, and exercise habits and how it impacts sexual attraction in the relationship, without unduly hurting them and making a change even more difficult? How can I help him to help himself? 

Just as an aside: the only reason I mention my own state of shape/health is that I wanted to avoid criticizing in the opposite direction, as in...anyone who might think I'm overweight or dismissive of my own appearance, and hypocritically pointing fingers at my husband to shape up. I know too many women who don't take care of their own bodies, and then specify when looking for dates with men, ""No fatties! Emphasis on a nice bod! Must be muscular!"" and so on. It's just as difficult to maintain a ""Ken-like"" appearance as it is to look like a Barbie doll.

We're both in our early twenties. 
I was nervous about starting anything with someone who wasn't completely sure of their sexuality, but I let my anxieties go because both of us just wanted to have fun and see where it went.

2 months in to just seeing where it goes, and the relationship starts to get serious and we agree to date exclusively. 6 months in and profess our undying love for one another. All this time, we've agreed to keep it under wraps, but a few roommates and colleagues find out, and although they seem stunned everyone generally agrees that the relationship is a good fit. 

But aside from those few people who have found out, we're 8 months into dating and when we're around people that haven't guessed, she treats me as a friend and not a significant other (with some friends in particular she'll even comment on the attractiveness of men in front of me). I don't think she's ever outrightly told someone she's single and she's never to my knowledge flirted with someone, but she says she hasn't told anyone because she's not gay and doesn't want people to get the wrong impression of her...

My opinion of this is that she's young and nervous and has got a lot to figure out (she's 2 years younger and this is her first long relationship), and I really do love and care for her so I don't want to put a lot of pressure on her. However, this is getting a bit out of hand if she's keeping me a secret from roommates/work colleagues.
She's been working oversees for about a month now, and I visit her on Thursday, meeting some of her co-workers that probably don't know I exist. 

How should I handle this? I've brought it up to her a couple times, but she's basically steamrolled over my suggestion of telling people. 

Also, I should mention that because I'm confident in who I am, I've told just about everyone I know. When we went to visit my family although they knew, she barely touched me the entire time, and when we went to hers she was frantically trying to make up excuses for why I was sleeping in her room instead of the guest bed.

I'm 21 in my third year at college as a film student, an aspiring comedian, and I make somewhat popular youtube videos. 

I haven't been in anything close to a serious relationship in 3 years. My senior year of high school my best friend since third grade slept with my girlfriend of 1 year, multiple times. When I found out about it I confronted them, got sad, moved on, never talked to them again, and began living my life.

I've mapped out what I want to do with my life for the next 4 years. Finish college, join the peace corp, and try to make an independent documentary. I also have many other entertainment related life goals, but I'll see where it takes me. With all of that said, I've come to the realization that I don't necessarily need someone else to be happy. I've come to the realization that It would be better to be alone than to be in a bad relationship, but I wouldn't mind being in a good relationship. I told myself I enjoy being single, so it would take someone really wonderful to make me not single.

St Patrick's Day:

I meet Destiny (not her real name). I was working on a shoot schedule for my next production, when my friends call me. They're drunk at a bar and needs a ride home (I was invited I just was super busy) So I take a break and go to the bar/grill restaurant where they are. They are all in the lobby chatting with a server who is a mutual friend of ours, I walk in and say hi to them all, they all kind of mutually started teasing me for having a beard, I had to grow it for a production I'm working on. We're all being super loud. So jokingly I act offended and turn to my right where I see another server enjoying our conversation, I read her name tag and say in a bubbly metro sexual voice, ""well hello there Destiny!"" She eats it up: We make small talk, I make a couple of jokes, she laughs her head off but she's also comes back pretty quickly, just good chemistry right off the git-go. My friend drunkenly leans over and says, ""Hey don't talk to him, he's got a beard!"" to which our mutual friend who works there says, ""oh no she likes guys with beards!"" she blushes my buddy writes down my number on the host stand with a dry erase marker and says, ""of course the one freak girl who likes beards, well theres his number call him!"" My friends are pretty funny drunk.

The next morning I get a text from her, we get to know each other turns out we share similar interests. She's going to improv comedy school in LA, and love to work on sketch comedy. Awesome

So I ask her when we can hang out, she tells me she's at work but I should come in and visit her. I told her I'll come in at the end of her shift and we should get coffee. She agrees, so I get there. She asks me where I live I tell her, turns out we live right around the block from each other so then she tells me that she actually got a ride to work from a co-worker that day so If I wanted she could ride with me.

We get in my car drive up the mountain near our house and look over the city in my car. I tell her my radio died earlier this week, so she starts singing a Tenacious D song. We talk for 2 hours about our interests, goals, fears, relationships, and everything. 

In my mind I'm like, ""This is the girl I've been waiting for! She's great, everything I used to describe my dream girl is here in my car. ""

She then tells me, ""I think you should know, I've been married before and I have a 5 year old son""

The divorce was clean, they were both too young and stupid. The child's father has a huge supportive family and is already remarried, in the military and pays enough child support for Destiny to live comfortably with joint custody of the child. So it's not like she's trying to get a baby daddy to support her, she does fine on her own.

I take her home, I can't help myself so I kiss her. It starts, out of nowhere, pouring rain on us. greatest first kiss ever. We hung out the entire next night and the next night. No sex, or anything just some nice heavy make-out sessions. I haven't met her kid yet.

For instance, I didn't want to go to her bike club meetings with her, because honestly I'm not sure how much I care about bicycling, but I didn't mind if she went and then filled me in on the details later. I also didn't mind eating the pastries she makes (she's a pastry chef) but I am not really interested in all the history/production/etc of them. I don't talk to her about programming (i'm a programmer by trade) or video games because I don't think she'd care that much about it.

She has been laid up in bed for a bit, and there's this guy from one of her nature/political volunteer organizations coming by to bring her things.

This was something I've managed with and to my own detriment this likely was the start of my problem. 

So I worked and covered the majority of our bills. Two years ago he decides he wants to move closer to a studio in West Hollywood he's been working there and promises me that he will be at the studio everyday grinding. I believe him but I caution him that the rent was too much for me to handle by myself ( I wanted to move to a small two bedroom) But I say yes... That arrangement crumbled within weeks of us moving in and it was a struggle to maintain the bills... I worked extra hours but I couldn't keep up and we were evicted. He on the other hand refused to get a job and proceeded to complain that he didn't want to live there anyway.

Now... we found a new great house in a terrible neighborhood, but I was grateful... it was a roof over our sons head. A family member moved in in with us so the bills were cheaper. He promised to pay his half of the bills but of course that didn't happen. Some months he'd give me $100 less than his share of rent ( not including bills), some months he'd give me half of his rent, and some months nothing. I begged him to get something part time but he always refused. 

This past christmas I just didn't have the extra money to stretch so we were short a few hundred dollars. I bought my son NOTHING, luckily we have fantastic grandparents and he got what was on his list. He told me he'd get a job but day after day he'd just be home doing exactly what he was doing before. I  was getting desperate so I started looking for jobs for him and I found one, but he would only go if I was doing it too... DID I MENTION I ALREADY HAVE A JOB! So now I'm working two jobs to baby sit him. But I'm happy we're making money we have all these plans to pay off all the money he had to borrow and the money we still owe our landlords... then the job abruptly ends. And now we are back to square one.

Except I found out I am now pregnant. Even with that he still refuses to get any sort of part time work. I've said fine if you don't want to pay leave... he refuses and laughs in my face. He goes on and on about how we shouldn't be paying rent anyway we should be paying land tax and blah blah blah... oh and our phones are cut off.

There are plenty of other things he does that now grate on my nerves even more now that he won't help with bills. He hangs out with a local bum who drinks 40's on our steps. he wants our son to go to a preschool next to a scary park with gang taggings all over it an drunk creep pedo's hanging out on the benches. He complains that I don't explore his mind or give him enough sex.

He stays home all day everyday.... unless it's for his art which usually gets him out once a weeknight... I don't know what to do, I've lost my love and respect for him. But I just don't know what to do. I need advice from people who don't know us.... he can be very charming... and very narssacistic.

I'm just in a bad relationship. This will however be my last. I just need to write it down and let my reality look me in the face.

Have wife's contact information and that of my ex's parents. Do I put the two of them in touch and burn this girls world down around her?**

Update 1: I wish I could say my intentions are completely noble here about being concerned for the wife but I'm secretly hoping she could be a back channel of information (since I'm in NC with the ex) so I can stay informed of what's going on with my ex and watch from the sidelines as her life implodes

**Update 2: I'm afraid if I tell her parents personally that it will just be her word against mine.  Whereas if the wife goes to them and says your daughter has been sleeping with my husband for the past 2 months it's a more effective message**

Update 3: Messages are coming in faster than I can respond to each one so I'm updating here. I also have a fear that this wife may, out of denial, anger etc. may throw me under the bus and lash out at me with the law of unintended consequences being what it is and all.  Then I'd just look like a total loser in everyone's eyes

**Update 4: Yes, I'm still very much in love with her.  Yes, one day I'd still very much like to be friends with her and I am very well aware that if I do this all of that will be off the table completely.  Do I ruin 4 years of fond memories of one another to blow this girls life up?**

Update 5: I'm really starting to move to the line of thought of I need to do what's best for me and everybody else's feelings be damned.  That would include me just dropping this whole thing and not telling anyone about it and let the chips fall where they may.  I think I just really need stay out of this and let this all go.  Of course those are my thoughts at the moment.  A lot of you are right, this is my way of staying somewhat connected to her even though I'm not in her life anymore. If I'm going to tell his wife it should be out of real concern and not one out of a place of non bitterness or spite 

**Update 6: I've really been going back and forth on this all day today and thanks to what a lot of people said in the comments about both pros and cons I'm going to hold off on contacting anybody for now.  I'm really feeling enlightened at the moment due to everyone sharing their wisdom and experience with me.  I've already lost enough dignity and self respect through this process.

This is an update to [the thread regarding returning bday cards and a t shirt she bought for her married ex boyfriend who she's now sleeping with](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/tvxcr/is_returning_her_mailpackages_considered_breaking/).

I'm M35 and she is F28.  Long story short I caught my gf of 4 years sleeping with her married ex boyfriend in our apartment.  She refused to leave when I confronted the both of them and I had to get the cops involved to remove them from the premises.

You guys were fantastic with your advice in my last threat and several of you suggested I needed to track down the guys wife and let her know.  I wasn't sure if I should do this thinking that the universe would dish out its own karma but the more I dwelled on how hurt I was, the more I felt justified in my actions.  The problem was that I had no idea of how to find this guys wife.

**As of yesterday, I now have the guys wife's home address, employer and facebook information**

My ex has always held herself out to be a sweet genuine small town girl with morals and values and me and all of my friends bought it hook line and sinker.  Her christian parents think she can do no wrong.  She has admitted that her parents/sister do not know about this guy because they still hate him from the last time they dated.

I also found out that the guys wife found her number in his phone and texted her pleading with her to stop texting her husband and she is trying to save her marriage/family.  She had to then contact her cousin who is related to the wife (WV) to find out if this was true and indeed there is no plans for a divorce (even though she told me they talked about marriage/kids together).

/r/RA, I have never been so crushed, humiliated and disrespected in my life.  I am trying to be the bigger person but with each new piece of information I get I get more and more angry and want her to hurt like I do.  

I so badly want to contact his wife and tell her everything I know. I also want to tell her that if she wants my ex out of her life she needs to place a phone call to my ex's parents and explain to them that their daughter has been sleeping with her husband for the last 6 weeks despite her pleas to stop.  My ex is extremely close to her family and the fact that they knew she had a role in wrecking this marriage/family would tear her apart.

Obviously, this is the nuclear option and would obliterate any fond memories I have of her or she has of me if she were to discover my involvment.  I am really going back and forth between what to do here.

Do I nuke a 4 year relationship from space or just let it go? I'm guessing the majority of you will say just let it go and move on but damnit if the idea doesn't keep creeping in to my brain.

We were each others first loves and best friends until a pretty messy break up late last year. Since that time we've been able to overcome some of worst aspects of it and have become friends again, but under NO circumstance will we ever be together as a couple. Ive been pretty great with this. 
Now, about a month or so ago she got a new bf and has been wanting me to meet him. She brings it up almost weekly and I always decline. The reason being that I finally feel good with our distance, but I feel like being around her and someone else might give me some knee jerk jealousy reaction and cause me to impulsively want something I currently have no desire for. In the past I have caused her to cheat on bfs and get back with me, and immediately I would regret it once it was done. I think after alot of time has past this might not be an issue, but right now the thought of it makes me feel really uncomfortable. She tells me that I am family to her and that she tells him about me all the time (something I said was a bad idea) and that he feels like he should be able to meet her friends. I can agree with that, but I kind of feel like I should do what's best for me here, and not necessarily care about how it affects them. 
I will be ok with not seeing her for the next year if that's the case, or even to stop talking for a while if that's what it comes to, but she doesn't seem to want any of that. 
The thought of possibly being a third wheel around them sounds pretty terrible.

I have been dating a seriously cool woman for about four months now. I learned on our first date that she is involved in the porn industry, and is very open about her involvement. At the time, it had been about a year and a half or so since she had last shot a scene.

I am cool with her having done porn in the past, the way I see it; it's safer than just picking up random guys in the bar due to having to provide proof for sexual health testing and controlled environments. She is very picky about who she will work with and what she will do.

However, she just landed a new ""gig"" which she will be filming next week. This is significantly less cool. I am honestly not sure how to deal with this. We have talked about what happens if she does more hardcore while I am dating her, but up until now, it's always been sort of a ""we'll just have to see how I deal with it"" sort of scenario.

I am torn between trying to be strong enough to support her emotionally (as it is a rather trying experience apparently) on the one hand, and being very hurt (why can't she just get a ""normal"" job, don't I count for anything?) on the other.

Do I cut and run? Do I scale our relatively new relationship back to just a friendship? Do I tough it out and be the ""bigger man,"" pretending I know what the hell I'm getting in to?

Oh, and you'd better believe that I will absolutely insist upon condom use. They may medically certified at the reputable studio she's filming at, but I'm struggling enough with the thought of another penis inside her. **EDIT** Good point, it's not up to me to force her to make changes. This is more of a sticking point for whether or not I make up my mind to stay, obviously I don't have to right to *demand* anything of her.

**UPDATE:** I'm going to ride it out for now. It's too good of a thing to just throw out the window, I knew this would happen. It's not easy for me emotionally, but that really boils down to me getting more attached than I anticipated. We have already discussed being casual but totally honest, this is a test of that. It's been established that neither of us are expecting marriage or kids out of this, so what the hell, chalk this up to the funnest learning experience I've ever had. What a way to confront my insecurities, eh?

My wife and I have been married for near three years.  After getting married, she became pregnant immediately, but we split after I found out that she had been unfaithful.  We got back together a year and a half ago after she ""came to her senses,"" as she put it.  Our daughter is now 2, which she hasn't let out of her sight, partially due to her CP diagnosis.  I am 29, she is 25.

Lately, I've been getting weird vibes from her, but the last week have been off the chart.  For posterity's sake, she is home less than half the time as she spends most nights at her parents'.  As a rule, we don't have sex more than once a month.  She began using the patch for birth control last cycle, yet we didn't have sex.  She took her third patch off two weeks before the wedding and urgent two days before the wedding that I need to pick up her birth control, mind you almost a week past when it should have been applied.  She asked me 4 times over the course of the two days before the wedding if I remembered to grab it (she was once again staying at her parents').  The first thing she sees me at the rehearsal dinner she doesn't even say hello, but asks if I brought her patches.  She says how important it is for her to put it on the night before the wedding.

I went on a vacation to my parents' 2 hours away the night of her sister's wedding announcement party.  My facebook had been deleted because I had a great job advancement opportunity and I wanted to control what was known about me.  She had taken pictures with a guy that I had known she was trying to see when we were apart.  He is married and when his wife read his facebook messages threatened to bash my wife's head in with a softball bat.  Since that party night, she has liked every status that he has posted, no matter how trivial, when she won't even publicly show that she is married to me on facebook.  This guy lives one mile from the venue.  If you couldn't tell, my facebook is now active again.  When she found out, she told me that I should deactivate it again.

Fast forward to this past weekend, the weekend of the wedding.  She is in the bridal party and a part of all of the festivities.  Children were supposed to leave at 5, so I took my daughter home for the night.  I attempted to kiss her, to which she gave me the cold shoulder, but relented when her mother, who was also standing by the car, told her to cut it out.  She said how she was going to be home by 8 as she had another reception to go to that evening.  I get a message at 8 pm asking if our daughter was sleeping, then another at 8:51 pm saying she was just leaving and would be home soon.  

During the reception I was talking to some female coworkers who were also related to the groom.  She interrupted mid-sentence to tell me that I had to leave.  The day after the wedding, my wife told me how the co-workers gave her dirty looks all night.  It turns out there were was a period of the night where she was missing, which she said that she was driving people home.

My wife finally arrived home at 1 am to recount her night's events.  She told of how one of the groomsmen, who I had spoke to for half an hour before the ceremony including being married to my wife, had walked up to her and asked what the chances were that they would hook up that night.  I was peeved, but he is an idiot.  Nothing she can do about it.  She then tells of how she spent 2 hours with the above mentioned married man who didn't have his wedding ring on.  He told of how his wife left for California on bad terms and he was able to ""do whatever or whoever he wanted"" when she was gone.  

As we lay in bed together I notice that she has scrapes on her inner thighs, which she attributes to dancing.  I get her cortizol to help her heal.  Two days later her sister is approached by a coworker saying how it was too bad that my wife and I split after the weekend.  Within an hour she tells me that she has a UTI.  She has not had such an infection in all of the time we have been seeing each other, so she isn't prone to them.

Today she asked what my plans were for the weekend of the ""homecoming"" for her hometown.  I had an event that I may go to, but told her that I may not go to it and may spend the day with her.  She tells me that she is having lunch and dinner with a girlfriend along with spending time with her that day and she didn't want me to be in town.  In fact, she forbade me from coming to the homecoming.

1370774029.0,51,self.relationship_advice,1fz5b8,Boyfriend's friends let my cat run away and it brought our relationship issues to a head. Help!,kittygobyebye,73,22,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fz5b8/boyfriends_friends_let_my_cat_run_away_and_it/,"I just feel so sad and alone right now that I have to get this out and see if I'm being unreasonable or whether there's anything I can do to improve the situation. We are 25f and 31m.


For the last week I have been away from home house-sitting for someone else. I got a call from my boyfriend this morning telling me that one of our cats (we have/had two) was gone. Two of his friends are staying over at the apartment and one of them went out to smoke last night and left the door open, and the cat escaped. Somehow none of them noticed this until 10 this morning, when they started looking and of course cannot find the cat. We live downtown in a large city and this is an indoor-only cat, so he has no survival skills and gets terrified outside. I went home immediately and looked, put up signs, etc. but we cannot find the cat and probably never will, and I am devastated.


Now the relationship issues come in. I was bawling all morning when I found out. I was *so* angry at the friend who let the cat out because they have known us for years and know about our cats, so why on earth wouldn't they close the door? I just can't get over how careless and inconsiderate it was. I said all this through tears to my boyfriend and I told him I wanted the friends to leave because I was so upset I didn't want to deal with seeing them in my house (they are supposed to spend two more days). My boyfriend blew up at me and said he couldn't believe how ugly I was behaving and that it wouldn't improve the situation and was outrageous and terrible to tell the friends to leave. 


Later in the day after I'm exhausted from hours of looking for the cat and just lying on the bed, my boyfriend comes over as if he wants to console me and rubs my back. Then he says that what's on his mind is trying to figure out how to move forward with the relationship with these friends because apparently they heard us fighting and heard me saying I wanted them to leave, and my boyfriend says he is totally embarrassed. I tell him that we aren't so co-dependent and he can just continue being friends and condem my behavior if he's so concerned. But during this conversation, all I can think is how unbelievable it is that my cat is gone and all he is worrying about is his image to his friends via association with me. It makes me sick and feel so alone, like he completely lacks any empathy whatsoever. 


This is not the first time my boyfriend has lacked empathy and has even been hostile to me when I am having a really hard time. In literally every single crisis we've faced over the last couple of years he has refused to comfort me, instead criticizing my response and saying I'm too emotional. When I ask him why he treats me like crap when I'm upset he says it's because it's impossible for him to be nice to me when I'm behaving what he sees as so irrational or unkind (I snap and am unpleasant when I'm really upset). 
Examples include:

-Having constant pain and bleeding from an infected IUD that may have caused infertility 

-Conflicts with abusive, estranged parents

-I was writhing in pain in the taxi ride home after a surgery once and I was impatient with the cab driver but also kept apologizing explaining I was in a lot of pain, and BF was still furious at me and wouldn't talk to me

-Getting fired, etc.


This is a definite pattern in his behavior, and I'm sure he would say me crying and getting really upset and snapping at him or others when I'm in situations like above is a pattern in mine. I honestly feel like his treatment of me is abusive, but I can't tell whether he's right and maybe I am just unreasonably emotional. Am I really that bad for snapping at people when I'm super, super upset or in pain? Is that totally abnormal as my BF thinks it is? Or is he just abusing me?

Tl;dr: Boyfriend is super unsupportive at critical times, but it may be due to me being too emotional or short with people in those situations. My cat ran away and it brought these problems to the surface.

What to do?,ihaveabuttAMA,82,30,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1a5xmc/so_im_unexpectedly_pregnant_what_to_do/,"It wasn't something I had expected to happen, especially not when we'd taken precautions to prevent such a thing. Especially not when my partner and I have both recently embarked on jobs as consultants in creative fields (read: flexibility and an hourly rate, but no benefits) and are planning a massive multicultural wedding ceremony 18 months from now. 

It definitely wasn't something we'd planned, though the idea of children has come up in conversation quite frequently since our engagement. Except every time it did, we spoke about it in the future tense. Some day. Maybe. Once we're married and established. *Maybe.*

But now I'm pregnant. 

I don't have time to debate the merits of taking on my husband's last name -- now we have to decide, pretty immediately, whether this new family will also include a third person in a handful of months. Can't I just crawl back into bed and eat Nutella out of the jar until this goes away? No?

If we decide to go ahead and stay pregnant, everything is up in the air. Our baby would be born right about the time I'd planned to run the Philly Marathon. And he or she would be almost a year old on our wedding day. I'd be skipping out on the skydiving trip I promised my sister for her birthday this summer, because I'm fairly certain pregnant women aren't allowed to willingly fling themselves from small airplanes. We'd probably have to move at some point, since our loft apartment in a trendy city neighborhood doesn't have much room for a nursery. And there's the whole ""figure out how to be new parents while also figuring out how to be spouses"" thing.

If we decide that it's ""not the right time,"" which it likely isn't, then I get to deal with the euphemistic business of ""terminating"" my pregnancy with a ""procedure"" begun in a doctor's office and finished in agony at home. I get to cry in the shower by myself and deal with the reality of what that really means. I get to keep running, look forward to fulfilling the plans I'd made with my future husband, and maybe still fit into the wedding dress in my closet (the one I bought way too early because I was so excited about getting married). But I also get to feel like a shitty person, probably forever. Our plans don't get derailed and our future still looks pretty easy, but I know I'll always feel guilty for making this seemingly selfish choice. 

Either way, there's no easy answer. We both value the power of choice and are grateful we're in a position to have choices at all. 

My dude has been honest that he doesn't know the right move and would never tell me what to do. But he's been honest that he's not sure he'll ever actually want children and can't promise his mind will change down the road; there's a multitude of excuses, like the world's too scary, we don't have the money to provide the amazing life we'd want our kids to have, health care costs alone could ruin us... 

So what do we do? Do we take responsibility and figure out over the next 7-8 months how to be parents and not wind up completely broke? Or do we opt out and wait for a better time, when we're both actually ready? How do I deal with the consequences of this?

I'm looking for advice, maybe some sympathetic ears, maybe from someone who has gone through a similar situation.

**TL;DR: Fiance and I were surprised to discovered that I'm pregnant and don't know what's the right move now. We're in our mid-twenties, cohabitating and have been together for three years, and are planning a wedding, but probably not emotionally or financially prepared for this. Halp?**

We have spent most of our lives together, have been very close, and are best friends. She fell into what I would say is a depression about 5-6 years ago.  We have no kids, but 3 years ago we tried and she miscarried twice.


She's been in talk therapy for 4 years.  She's sometimes says suicidal things like she wants to die, she hates the choices she made, etc.  For years I've been worrying about her, trying to help her get better, and basically falling into the cravass of co-dependency.


For example:  She is worried about the dog having an accident in the house while we are at work, I'll try to beat her home and clean it up and not tell her so she doesn't fly off.  If she doesn't get to the gym at least 4 times a week she crumbles, so I bust ass to get home and get food cooked.  I dread the rain because she treasures this swim club she's in and freaks out if class gets canceled.


I've worked a lot on myself over the past year and half to be more of my own person.  In the past she has isolated herself from our friends, and I've followed.  This has resulted in our pool of friends shrinking considerably.  I tow the line with our mutual friends by going out with them solo, leaving her at home often.

Shortly after the miscarriages she revealed that she thought she was bisexual.  We talked about it and agreed that she was still very into me and that it was just kinda fun to talk about.  She still had her major ups and downs, but we had a period of really good sex which was very effective at distracting me from her issues (depression) and mine (co-dependant, needy).


Well fast forward to about January or so of this year.  I'm getting more and more better.  She still has the huge swings.  I start to realize I think I need out.  When she would get real low, I would start to slip, and try to do things to fix it.  Recognizing the traps I was falling into helped me a lot.

**But guess what?  I'm a huge coward.  I can't leave her**


Then comes the kicker.  We're lieing around in bed doing some fantasy stuff, having a good time.  She goes on about certain female strippers we've seen, and then tells me about her best friend in JR High, how she had a physical relationship with her, until her friend got scared.  And about another girl she messed around with right before we got married.



The next day I asked her if she thinks she could be gay.  she's trying to figure it all out.  I'm convinced though, and know that our days together are truely numbered.  I'm happy for her, because (besides me being an idiot) her being gay is the true source of her depression.  She's ashamed and hates herself for it, and now she can be move on.

I've been up and down sad all week, and finally starting to let go, and in fact look forward to single life a little bit.

We are so young that it's almost frivolous to ask for advice, but it's been on my mind for a while. 




It doesn't come up often, but she sometimes mentions how she thinks I should plan most of our dates, and take more control. She says that it's my fault we end up doing boring things (hanging out with her family night after night), because I didn't plan anything else. 

We had a funny discussion about chivalry once, and where I thought it was sexist, she thought it was common. Doesn't bother me and it wasn't an argument, just interesting perspective.

I'm not bothered by her family, but it feels weird to me. My whole life I've been trained (mostly by other girls, I guess) to disregard gender roles and assume absolute equality in all decisions and processes.

From my perspective, she's picking and choosing gender roles that benefit her. I could use some advice in what to do, if anything. I don't want to screw anything up, but it'd be nice if we could find a happy medium. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

**Tentative Plan**: Get out both of our calendars and plan the fuck out of the next few months. Ignore gender expectation problems.

**Update**: I'm taking more control. Being more assertive and decisive. She really likes it. After two days of successful dates, I am very happy.

Original update [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/q9mos/wife_of_7_years_wants_out_update/)

Okay so last night we finally had what I would call an honest discussion. We had to go over our finances and what would be my responsibility and what would be hers. After all that, she told me that she was really sorry for what's happened. I told her I was as well.

She said she wants to move out to an apartment. She asked if I wanted her to move out. I told her part of me did and part of me didn't, but that I would let her go if it would make her happy. She told me that she couldn't afford an apartment and to pay half of our mortgage. I told her that I would take care of the mortgage and not to worry about it.

She said she couldn't do that because if something happened to me she'd still be on the hook for the mortgage and an apartment. I told her that she'd break the lease on the apartment. She said she couldn't leave because that would worry her too much.

Point being, if she really wanted to leave, she would have. I gave her every way out she wanted and she couldn't do it.

We talked some more and went over all of our problems. I told her I wanted another chance at getting this right. I told her I would continue going to counseling and that I would continue to take whatever medications the shrink or my regular doctor tell me to in order to take care of some anxiety issues I have. I told her I was going to do those things regardless of what happened with us.

I told her I would work very hard to address every one of her complaints with our marriage, and that she would have to put in her side of that effort. She told me she couldn't believe that I would be able to change in the way that she needs and that she's scared I would slide back in 6 months. I told her that with continued counseling and honest effort, that that wouldn't happen. 

I can't predict the future, and maybe things won't work out in the end, but at least I am getting an honest fighting shot at making things right and our marriage work. She agreed to give us some time to work things out.

She is going to continue sleeping in our guest bedroom until she feels comfortable with sleeping in our room again. I was fine with that. I am just glad she is finally starting to come to her senses. I told her that these past few weeks have been the roughest of our lives and that I will make damned sure we don't have to through anything like this again.

I open them up one by one im shocked at what I am reading, things like ""Meeting me at the lane or common, I'm hard for you"", ""I'm wearing my favourite jumper, you around later for a snog on the stairs"", ""Going to Tesco's later, fancy a quick Shag"" and things like this. All the texts were from Monday last week, also one saying he couldn't meet up on Thursday. Don't think I've ever driven home so fast in my entire life.

Bob and I have been together for a few years, and we get along great.  He's an awesome guy, and we have a lot of fun together.  About a year ago, Bob met Steve in college and became friends.   

As I've gotten to know Steve, I've decided that I don't like him.  He's not actually a frat boy, but he acts like one.  He loves joking that he's an alcoholic with no intention of stopping.  He hits on pretty much everyone, whether it's appropriate or not.  He's always loud and thinks he's the greatest thing ever.  However, knowing he's my boyfriend's friend, I keep my mouth shut and play nice.   

I was spending some time with Bob at his house yesterday, and he invites Steve over.  We're all hanging out and playing nice, when Steve and I get into a debate.   Well, it was more of a debate from my end.  I was trying to reasonably state my case, where as he was being loud and obnoxious, talking over me, and finally told me I was stupid and naive.

Bob was sitting there listening to this the entire time, but didn't say anything.  The two of them left shortly after to go on an alcohol run.  I was going to wait around until they got back, but as I sat there, I became more upset.  I left before they got back; I was afraid of what I'd say to them because of how fired up I became.

This really is only the tip of the iceberg:   

Back in April, I was at a house party with Bob and Steve was in attendance.  Bob was off drinking with some other people, and Steve and I were sitting around talking with a couple of other people.  Steve propositions me, knowing full well that Bob and are are a couple.  I brought this up to Bob at a later date when the alcohol had worn off, but he continues to hang out with this guy.  In fact, it's like he looks up to him.

But what happens when the challenge is gone from everything? Am I - Are we all, supposed to go through life looking for the next thing to make us excited again?

I guess this might sound silly, but whatever, I think sex is a big/important part in a relationship.

We have been together for 7 months (both 22 years old).

On average I'd say we have sex once a week, though most of the time it's once every 2 weeks. To put it bluntly, that's not enough for me.

Well, it would be alright for me (there is always masturbation) but there seems to be a double standard in our relationship.

I have to initiate sex 99% of the time, and usually I get shot down, which is a real blow to my self-esteem (as silly as it may sound, I feel really unattractive then). For example this morning I was giving her a sort of massage, then I started touching her breasts/stomach and she seemed really into it, only to get rejected when I tried to go further. She then got up and went to the shower (no, not a hint to follow her. She doesn't want shower sex whatsoever) which just really killed the mood.

The thing is, whenever she's in the mood, I have to be available no matter what.

For example she went out last week, while I stayed inside (I wasn't in the mood to go out, so stayed in and watched some movies). She then called me at around 3AM asking if she could stay over.

I had no problem with that, so I told her of course. So when she came over she immediately started initiating sex, and I just sort of had to go with it.

I knew if I had rejected her then, she would be terribly insecure/pissed off.

I mean, even if you're not in the mood, but it's very obvious your partner is, is it that *weird/wrong* to ""give in"" and at least please your partner?

I know I have done that a few times.


I don't really know what advice I'm looking for, I guess I just wanted to vent.

Some more info: We both just got new jobs. We live on the west coast, our families across the country. Not only that, but she's an only child, and her mom isn't a very strong person. So at 24 years old, she is going to watch her dad die and have to be the rock that her mom will stand on. 

What do I do to make this situation easier for her?

1290537128.0,55,self.relationship_advice,eanhj,Told my GF I wanted to move out -she said if I did she would break up with me. I have one month to decide. ,sleepingontheroof,68,13,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/eanhj/told_my_gf_i_wanted_to_move_out_she_said_if_i_did/,"I'm 21 years old and my girlfriend of 2 years and I have been living together for most of our relationship. We moved into our own place 7 months ago (after living together on campus and later in a house with several friends). We've had many serious arguments in the last 3 months, some even ending with one of us breaking up with the other only to act like nothing happened the day after. Most of these arguments are about things relating to living together i.e. chores, attitude, sexual appetite, etc. 

2 weeks ago, after thinking about it for some time, I suggested that I move out on my own to improve things between us. My thinking was that if we lived apart we would get more excited to see each other, make an effort to be in a good mood or look nice when together, go on dates again, feel like we're spending quality time together, etc. She seemed to agree at the time but the next day she turned on the cute act in an obvious attempt to win me over. 

The day after that she confronted me when I got home from work, saying that if I moved out we would be finished. This led to another argument where a lot of sore feelings from both of us came to light, ending with her breaking up with me, calling me a motherfucker and a ""bad person"". She then went to spend the night at her parents', sending me texts saying ""You can still save this"" and the like. The next day she came home and took back her break-up with me. She's also given me an ultimatum of deciding what I want to do by Jan 1. 

I've been so busy with school work that I haven't been able to give it enough serious thought yet. Some days I'm really down and can't think about anything but moving out and getting back my independence. Other days my gf and I are even more loving and physical than normal, and I can't imagine leaving our apartment. She's constantly reminding me of what I'm doing putting her through, making me feel guilty for wanting to change my life or offering unexpected sex if I appear disconnected. I don't know what I feel or what I truly want. 

My girlfriend is my best friend (maybe my only true friend in the city I moved to for university) and I don't want her to hate me. I don't want to move out, be dumped and regret it -but I also don't want to condemn myself to a life I no longer enjoy. If anyone can offer me some advice in these troubling times of mine I would be grateful. 

**Edit** Some relevant back story: Since moving into the new place and in the few months prior, I have been suffering from some form of depression (I know what it's about and it's a different [unrelated] issue entirely). This has affected my gf to the point that she has insisted several times that I seek counseling (I have not). I have felt better in the last couple months and my gf has noticed, but during our argument she brought up how her life sucked while I was in the depths of my depression. This has only added to my feeling of guilt. 

**Edit 2** To clarify we have ""broken up"" 2 times before this. One of these times (the 2nd) was me -I took it back immediately. The first time we were drunk so we fell asleep and didn't even talk about it in the morning. Life just carried on as if nothing had happened, though I certainly thought we had broken up until she got out of bed.

This time was different. We were both sober and she told me she was breaking up with me. We continued to argue, then she dropped some hints that I ""could save us"" left for her parents place. The next day, she asked if she could come home and I said sure. We talked it through. She took back what she said, and I told her that I love her (I do). She then gave me the ultimatum -she didn't clarify whether moving out would mean automatic break-up, though she's made it clear that she would not trust me anymore if I moved out.

I miss the safety of having someone who was ""mine"".  I desperately miss knowing that I could call my SO and they would be there.

I frequently ask for sex, but almost always get rejected. I always just ask directly ""Would you like to have sex?"" She gets irritated when I ask, and always gives various reasons. Too hot, too tired, too busy. She says she just doesn't like it. She asks why can't we just cuddle and hug. We are not planning to have kids. I frequently masturbate to orgasm myself to relieve my desires.

The marriage is fine in general. I make a decent income, and we live quite comfortably. We laugh and joke. We are happy doing things together. We go for vacation and trips quite regularly, though I prefer activities that do not require me leaving the house. I am quite a good husband, good-looking, and do most of the chores at home, except for cooking. She gets to spend money on luxury nice things now and then, although I always tell her not to spend too much and to be frugal.

I have never really felt obligated to vacation with my own family, sometimes we have joined them, but more frequently we have not, for financial or other reasons.

His father plans two camping trips every summer, one that spans four days, and another that sometimes exceeds seven days. For the past 5 or more years we have attended both trips, and they have been the only vacations we have been on each year. I enjoy camping, but have a difficult time going so long without privacy or autonomy, and with their family dynamic. My father in-law micromanages everything, from the activities and schedule, down to the way I measure flour. My husband doesn't seem to mind being treated this way, but at 36, it's a tough pill to swallow. We always end up fighting more on these trips than usual.

After these last two summer trips I asked my husband to take a vacation with my side of the family, in hopes of getting a break from the in-laws, however, my father in-law has announced that he has planned a trip to Disneyland,and has already told my children that they were going, without checking with us first. He is pressuring us for dates so he can plan around the other vacation with my family. My husband seems to think that we can afford both trips (I don't), and I would honestly rather take a different vacation ( I don't care for Disneyland) with just the four of us, instead of 2 with in laws.

1374086910.0,51,self.relationship_advice,1ii525,Getting married in September. Recent developments worry me. Advice needed.,ThrowawayVS,71,20,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ii525/getting_married_in_september_recent_developments/,"Using a throwaway because my S.O. knows my regular Reddit account.

I'm a 33 year old guy and I'm engaged to be married. Actually scheduled to be married in September. I love my fiancee, some of the best times I have are spent with her. I'm excited about marriage. We enjoy each others company, get along with each others friends. I'd say we have a lot of fun together and love each other.

That being said, the last few months some things have come up that bother me.

I'm self-employed. I've been self-employed for the last 4 years (been self-employed since she's known me). As with most self-employed people, my monthly income fluctuates. Some months are amazing, other months suck. It just so happens, the last 5 or 6 months have been really tight. Just been a tough time. Deals that I thought would close fell through, unexpected expenses came up that I had to pay for out of pocket ... and with a limited income coming in, finances have been tight on my end. I see a light at the end of the tunnel. My pipeline looks promising, but I want reap those rewards for another few months.

My fiancee has a good solid job. She makes really good steady money. She works in finance. To put it in perspective, her yearly bonus this year was close to $40K. Yes, $40K. Financially she's fine. She hasn't always been that way, just over the last year or two, but she's okay money wise.

We're paying for this wedding ourselves with very little help from others. We've had a few payments due for some vendors recently. She has a credit card and put the charges on her card. All in all it was around $4000 in charges; we're supposed to split them 50/50. We talked about it, I told her I'd get her the cash as quick as I can. I live with her, she knows the deal ... or so I thought.

You see, I've had several conversations with her recently telling her how tight things have been for me and how tough things have been financially. I've mentioned how I'm worried and have been cutting back on as much as I can to try and get through the wedding/other expenses.

Anyhoo, she's chatting with me online this morning and says, ""I really need that money for my credit card"". She likes to pay her card off in full every month. I told her, ""I'm trying to figure out all that right now. I'm going to get you as much as I can as quickly as I can.""

That's the truth. Even as recently as this morning I was looking at potential income and my cash and figuring out what I could give her when.

My comments apparently set her off.

She starts calling me a ""fucking loser"" and says ""I should learn to manage my money better"" ... berating me and going nuts. She thinks I'm taking advantage of her, she thinks I'm going to walk away from what I owe her .... yadda, yadda, yadda.

I tell her she was being really terrible to me by saying that. I tell her, ""I've talked to you multiple times about how tight things have been, and how tough things have been."" ... I really have had this conversation with her, and whenever we have this conversation she says, ""That's okay, I'll be here when you need me and I support you"" ... but when it comes time to walk the walk, she pulls shit like this.

I try to explain to her that my pay is way different than hers. It really is. In the 4 years I've been self-employed I've had months where I've made as much as $25K, then I've had other months where I've made literally a few hundred dollars. The last 6 months have been slow as shit. I've even been looking for part time work to try and supplement things. It's tough to find that as well.

I try and be as financially conscious as I can, but when you have 6 months of crap income coming in ... with bills to pay, with wedding expenses, with other unforeseen expenses. Savings and a ""nest egg"" go fast.

Anyways, we talked it out an hour or so ago, she basically said she wants me to keep her in the loop more about when I may be able to pay her. Truthfully, I'm always of the mindset of ""when I get the money you'll have it"", but she wants me to mention it regularly so she knows I didn't forget.

I guess that's fair enough.

Honestly though, what bothers me most about this is that a few years ago she fell into a tough financial time. Really tough. I stepped up and helped her out with whatever I could financially. I bought her groceries, paid for some of her bills when she couldn't ... then when I'm in a tough spot she pulls this.

I want to talk to her about it and I don't know how. Marriage is a team sport in my opinion, like basketball. If you're down one of your starters the rest of the team needs to step up. I feel that she isn't sympathetic nor is she understanding. The weird thing is, in most other situations she's the nicest girl in the world.

This thing frightens me. What if months or years after we're married my work COMPLETELY dries up? What if I'm in a HORRIBLE financial situation? I would think my wife should be there to support me, both emotionally and if need be financially ... I'm afraid after this she won't.

I'm in an odd situation (at least to me).

Been dating the same girl for 2.5 years. She's a virgin (clearly still is). I've been empathetic to the fact that she's a virgin and wanted it to be 100% comfortable for her. I couldn't live with the fact that I forced it onto her and made her regret her first time. However, here we are in April 2013...we still haven't had sex...and we haven't done anything foreplay wise in 7 months...now I'm starting to get sexually frustrated and impatient beyond belief. In regards to foreplay, getting head has happened once...I'm not allowed to go down on her...umm I can finger her for only a few minutes. She has low confidence about her appearance and barely lets me see her without clothes on (which is fucked cause she is hot imo). I understand that in the beginning, but I can only positively reinforce for so many years and get no progress. If you can't be comfortable with me in that respect for so many years, then why would you down the road.

She has told me in the past that I'm the one for her to break her virginity with, and get this...that the physical aspect is as important to her as it is to me. Which clearly isn't true.

On the positive side, we get along great, her family treats me like gold and has welcomed me in, the emotional aspect is all good...but I don't know if I'm willing to sacrifice the physical relationship anymore. I don't think I'm a pig for thinking like this, if I was, I'd leave the first few months into the relationship. My needs aren't being fulfilled.

I don't know what to do...I'm just sick and tired of waiting. And anytime I bring it up, I'm shut down. I've been told before (as in 4 months into the relationship, 7 months, 13, etc) that she thinks we will soon!!!....clearly all untrue.

I really need some rational advice, I live in a foreign country (I am from the USA) and I have been dating a very sweet girl who is a local for about 6 months now and things have been going great, her English is great, she is fun, and I really enjoy being around her. She even accompanied me on a trip back to the US to visit friends and family for 2 weeks (she paid for her ticket, but I paid for everything once we arrived in the country.) I truly had a great time and my friends and family really liked her a lot. Anyways towards then end of the trip when I had to convert my money - I noticed some of my foreign currency was missing. Anyways, on the last day we went shopping and she found two dressed she really liked, I told her I would buy her one and if she wanted the other then she could pay me back - she gave me the cash which was exactly the same amount that I was missing and I found it odd because she almost never carries cash... I did not want to cause a problem though because I feared a mistake on my part so I forgot about it - it was only 50 bucks. 

So fast forward to last night - I get back into town (of my adopted country) after a weekend trip to visit some friends and I decide to test my suspicions... She wants to visit and is almost to my place right after I get home, so I leave a wad of seemingly unorganized bundles of cash on my desk but I write down the total. As soon as she gets there I give her a kiss and ask if it is ok if I take a quick shower since I just got back... and she says no problem... Anyways I shower up and then we proceed to have a great evening - movie, dinner, and some sexy-time... afterwards I call her a cab (we don't have cars) and offer to pay the fare (a total of about 10 $) She declines my cash saying that she has some (which is most unusual for her) and I say ok and we part our ways... When she leaves I check the cash and sure enough it is ($11 out of about 130$) short... I was hurt more than anything - its not the money - its the stealing that really eats at me- I mean this is a girl whom I am really starting to fall for and in the past 6 months we have not had so much as a fight... but I cannot tolerate liars... lack of trust destroys relationships in my opinion...

I only have 2 instances where I am 95% sure she took a small amount of cash - more than anything else, it hurts - I feel wronged and foolish for being the trusting guy that I am... My plan right now is to test her one final time - I will leave some cash out and write down the total - then I will leave her alone with it and see what happens - I really want to believe that it was just a mistake on my part but I refuse to be played a fool and I cannot be with someone if I can't trust her - I know it seems like small beans - just a few bucks here and there - but its the principal - mean how can I take things to the next level with this girl if I can't trust her?

My boyfriend and I were dating for a few months when my parents decided they didn't want us to see each other, so for awhile we saw each other at church and school. A few months after that, my family moved across the country and my parents will not allow him to visit us. We have been dating for a year as of December 16th and we are extremely close and very much in love. We have now been living a thousand miles apart for almost 4 months. 

My parents disapprove strongly of our relationship, primarily because of his religious commitments, among other things. They have refused to speak with him, no matter how much we have tried to kindle a good relationship between them, to have them approve, because their approval means a lot to me. However, without them being willing to compromise or even put up an effort, I'm beginning to lose hope.

Today, my mother told me she's sick of having me around if I'm just going to leave later on, and she feels I'm using them as a crutch because I'm not ready to be on my own yet. She said if I'm going to make a life decision with which she so strongly disagrees, and not take into consideration how she feels, her house is not open to me anymore.

My father (always more rational) joined the conversation later and told me he won't force me to leave but if I am unhappy with the way things are and I would rather be somewhere else, I need to leave and go where I am going to be happy, and if not, I need to be happy and appreciate my family.

I am a quiet girl by nature and I'm not very outwardly emotional, but I am not unhappy. I always pull my weight as a member of the family, I am a full-time high school student, and on my way to getting my driver's license. I do not feel like I am in any way taking advantage of them unfairly. I don't know what more they expect from me other than to leave my boyfriend, which I won't do.

My boyfriend's parents are extremely supportive, and they treat me like a member of their family. I would finish high school and get a job while living in their house, get my license and when I turn 18, my boyfriend and I would live in the apartment his parents own, adjacent to their house, until we could afford to be in our own place.

In the case that it does not work out between my boyfriend and I, my godmother, grandfather, and two aunts all live in the area.

But being 17, is this a good idea? I am extremely scared of moving out on my own; I am shy and reserved and I don't do well in these situations. Is there a legal side I should know about? I need advice.

TL;DR: Parents want me to move out of their house and across the country to live with my boyfriend. Boyfriend and boyfriend's parents are very supportive, but I'm scared out of my mind.


UPDATE: Thank you guys so much for all the advice you've all given me in this thread. My parents and I have come to (somewhat) amicable terms in the situation; that being said, I will be moving in with my godmother. This way I will have the support system I need, as well as being able to maintain my relationships with both my boyfriend and my family.

I (28m) recently moved to Europe (from the USA) to be with her (30f). She became pregnant fairly quickly, and we decided to keep the child.

The reason she's breaking up with me has to do with something that happened months ago while I was still living in the USA. I disregarded her feelings (she had said she was uncomfortable with me doing it) and met up with a girl who I had dated and then become friends with. I did not lie to her, but I disregarded what she wanted, and she has been unable to get over that.

So anyway, she tells me today she thinks we need to break up. I have spent hours trying to persuade her, but it's not looking good for us. In addition to my own feelings of loss, I feel awful for the child and don't know how to go forward.

Advice needed.",black19,69,17,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/148qst/together_7_years_married_for_5_months_now_shes/,"After 7 years of being in a relationship with my girlfriend, I proposed. Now to take a brief step back, I must say that the 7 years leading up to the proposal were eventful. It was full of great memories and some memories not so great. We were young when we met, I was 23 and she was 25, and our relationship suffered as we learned how to navigate the ins and outs of a real relationship. We broke up several times for various reasons, some my fault and some hers. Let’s just say, we both did our part.

The most recent break up was about 2 years ago, right after she turned 30. Long story short, she had concerns that our relationship was stalling and that we weren’t taking the next steps. Funny thing is, I was under the impression we were. After months of being apart we finally talked and it turned out that we both wanted the same thing. Did I mention that we have communication issues?

Flash forward 9 months later, I propose. She says yes. We plan our wedding and we got married April (2012). Since we got back together, and including the time leading up to the proposal and through the wedding I felt our relationship finally felt right. We both knew where we were going. We’d begun planning to have kids and buy a home, you know, all the things normal couples do at this stage.

Apparently, she didn’t feel the same way. Almost as soon as we got back from our honeymoon she jumped head first into full blown maid of honor-type mode as she did what she could to help with her brother’s wedding, which was in August. It got to the point where she was so involved in those plans that she was increasingly more absent from our relationship. She spent many weekends away (her brother lives 5+ hours away) helping with bridal showers and whatever else was needed of her. By the time August came around, I was irritated. I felt so upset with the fact that my wife was never around that I couldn’t hold it.

I was done.

The day of her brother’s wedding, I told her that I would be so happy when it was over so I could have my wife back. I told her how much I felt like we hadn’t spent any time together over the last few months and how much I didn’t like it.

She was done.

I guess that conversation really made her think about how things were going and she slipped into herself and shut me out. She has a habit of compartmentalizing things. It’s the way she is and it’s the way she always has been. By the middle of September, I began putting her on the spot. I couldn’t live the way we were and I felt we needed to talk. I forced the issue and finally we talked. As she told me, her problem was that she “loves me but that she is not in love with me” anymore. No real specific problem. Just the vague and agonizing reason above. Another week or so goes by, with no real discussions being had, I force the issue of talking again, and next thing I know, she’s quit her job and is planning on moving back home (5+ hours away) by the end of the month.

For those playing the home game, we got married in April and separated by September.  She has a job back home now and I have my own place. We talk as if we’re friends, but she still refuses to talk about us. So I don’t really know what is going on. I know that I was crushed when she left on many levels but by now I’ve recovered enough to be able to function daily.

Here is my problem. What do I do? I still absolutely love this woman. To clarify, I am absolutely in love with this woman. She knows it. I don’t know a bit how she feels. Sure she still cares about me and loves me as a friend, but she owns me.

I would do anything to make our marriage work.

I have no clue how she feels.

I said my vows and I will not give up hope on us as those words did not come lightly out of my mouth.

I don’t know if the wedding vows mean a thing to her.

I frequently have a hard time on a daily basis.

She’s just ‘doing her’ back home.

Do I move on? Should I attempt to see her (which I haven’t since she left in September)? Do I fight for us? Should I just let her be and hope she comes around on her own terms? I have so many questions. I am not capable of compartmentalizing the way she can. This weighs heavily on me daily.

Help me keep a clear head?,fattydunno,65,13,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/12m333/21m_uncomfortable_with_my_girlfriends_21f/,"Hi guys. I guess I'm just getting things off my chest, and hoping for some help to get into a correct mindset to keep this relationship lasting and strong.    

My girlfriend of only a few months really likes the attention she gets from guys chasing/flirting with her. However, she tells me mostly everything (who's after her, etc.) so in this sense, I feel she has nothing to hide. But on the other hand, I feel she only flirts back to the people she finds attractive/interesting, and hence keeping her options open. She says she finds our relationship really refreshing that I'm not always keepings tabs on her (unlike her previous boyfriends) and she enjoys the freedom... however, I'm actually quite controlling, and so I'm actually in the process to change.    

Another thing that's troubling me is how fond she is of her ex. She's told me on more than one occasion of how they were perfect together, how he was pretty much perfect, and the only thing that stopped them was the ex's family. She's still also scared of hurting him ie. she admitted to me that she might drop my hand if she saw him whilst we're holding hands. This is because her ex is still after her, and often sends texts like ""Hey, I miss you"" and lengthy, emotional texts when he sees her with other guys. She's also told me she feels like they have a pact/race to find a significant other that's able to replace each other. **I'm 100% ready to commit to a serious relationship with her... but I'm not sure if she's ready to leave her past behind.** I sometimes feel like I'm the 2nd best option, after her ex, and it makes me unhappy.     

I use to be quite insecure... and I'm afraid with all this happening, my insecurities are creeping back. I know it's unattractive, and it bothers me a lot.

It's a frequency-of-sex question -- typical, right? :)

First, the background: Married man, 35 y.o. My wife (also 35) and I have been together for 14 years, married for 11 of those. We're a happy family with two lovely little boys, ages 3 and 6. We're both college-educated, debt-free, and gainfully employed doing meaningful work in non-profits. We don't make a ton of money, but embrace our Midwestern ethic of living within our means, and enjoy living in a city that has plenty of cheap and free things for couples and families. We're blessed with tons of friends and wonderful, supportive neighbors, and have a very active social life,with them, and with one another. We love to spend time together, and make every effort to ditch the kids, so to speak, and go on dates. Our home dynamic is healthy and balanced, and we both contribute substantially to maintaining the family and home, in terms of chores, maintenance, cleaning, procurement, childcare, etc.

We've been through counseling once, a few years ago, and it did what counseling is supposed to do -- refocused our attention on one another, gave us a safe place to talk, and helped us cope with an extraordinarily stressful workplace situation that I was understandably but inadvertently bringing home with me every day. (FWIW, I can't recommend counseling enough for couples in distress -- set the pride aside, and just do it! It saves marriages!).

In any event, our commitment to one another is strong; there's no jealousy or paranoia, etc., at all in our marriage. We love each other unto death do us part, as they say. I can honestly say that we're each others' best friend.

So, onto my question!

My wife and I are each others' first and only sex partners. We came into the marriage having experimented with everything else, and it's fair to say the first few years were somewhat awkward as we figured things out. We're both very passionate in bed, and both very giving. I read all the time about husbands who lose their interest in their wives: Count me out of that discussion! I crave intimacy with her, and she gets more beautiful by the day.

So what's the problem? Well, like a lot of working couples with children, life isn't as flexible and spontaneous as it used to be, and we have sex reliably once a week, on a good ole'fashioned 'date night.' It's fair to say that we live and die by our calendars, and the frequency/reliability of our sex life fits right in with that.

But I wish we lived a little LESS by it -- I'd love to have sex just ONE more time a week. Small potatoes, right? Nothing too elaborate -- I'll gladly save 'elaborate' for date night -- but finding a way to make that happen, in a way that doesn't set her on edge, has been extraordinarily difficult. When my wife says that she's tired, I know that it's not just a line -- we both work very hard, and often well into the night (thanks, non-profits!), and it's the absolute truth. But nevertheless, I'm a man, with a man's urges, and a wife who I find irresistible...and I just don't know how to make this happen. I might ask from time to time, though I do so with fear and trembling, as it were, as history hath shown, that if it's not a 'date night,' that I'm almost always certain to be turned down. This is a conversation that has caused friction into our relationship, and I'll admit to being too dense to figure out how to approach it.

I suppose it's relevant to add, that when she and I are on vacations alone (i.e., no kids), that we're likely to have sex most, if not all days.

So, there you have it, women of reddit! Is there any way I can have a successful conversation with her about it, without seting her on edge, or making her feel like she's somehow to blame for something? You can't believe how much my mind and body would be set at ease, if I just knew that from time to time, that we might be intimate just one more time a week!

We're getting married in just under two months now. We've both frequently discussed what we thing we think we'd like to experience during sex and our expectations. For example I have always had a desire to eat a girl out, and she's never even really expected that and was kind of taken a back but more or less enthusiastic about it, she is even shaving just for me.

I would really like to have her go down on me though, but she is really nervous about the thought of that. I think its because just the whole idea of sex makes her nervous and the idea of putting that in her mouth just is a little nerve racking. She says she'll definitely try but it might take her a few times of us getting used to things before she wants to try that. So my question is basically what could I do to maybe make her feel more comfortable?

Is there anything I can do now? Or is there anything I could do on our wedding night?

Also as a side note, I would be interested in getting some advice (for the newbies :) on how we could learn new things to try and keep it exciting. What things should we do on our honeymoon? Just keep it serious please.  


EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to all the responses on this thread. I didn't imagine I would get such a full response to my questions. I am very grateful and thankful for those of you who have been genuinely helpful and supportive. While we might not all have the same opinions and beliefs on this matter, we should still be able to dialogue and seek help from each other without having to fear ridicule or disdain.
To those who have been less than supportive. I very much resent those who have actually suggested going against what our beliefs are, to break off our wedding day or postpone, or to actually suggest to be unfaithful to each other. I am very happy that me and my fiance had had the personal control to wait until we found a truly special person to share this one time gift with and not give in to our baser lusts and desires.
All in all, I'm still glad that a dialogue was shared here and that we have such a place to come and do just that. Your continued advice and comments are welcome, I will be preparing as much as possible in the next couple of months but ultimately we are going to just be aloof about it and relaxed and have fun.



2nd EDIT: Also if you have any intention of commenting that we should have sex before marriage or that it is silly/stupid to not have sex before marriage (I don't care what your reasons are). Please just save the energy in your fingers and don't. You can feel free to think of me as close minded if you wish but I did not come here to get your opinion on sexual abstinence or sex before marriage so please just save it.

obviously I made a new account, because I do have a hard time talking about this topic but I really don't know what to do anymore.

My boyfriend (24) and I (23) have been dating for a bit over a year and so far everything has been going well. We moved in together and I feel like he is the one for me and we are pretty much settled. 

Lately a problem came up for me. It all started when he told me some month ago, that he would like to pee on me. I am very open to try new things so I let him pee on my chest while we took a shower together. I told him right after that I didn't exactly enjoy it but he did a lot. With that the topic was closed for me but a week ago I woke up because something felt weird, so as I opened my eyes I saw my boyfriend standing above me in the bed, peeing on me. Of course everything ran on the bed sheets and I had to clean it up, which wasn't exactly nice to do. I got incredibly mad at him and he apologized and said that he should have asked me before. I told him that I don't like to have pee all over me and that he shouldn't do it again.

Today the same thing happened again. I was sleeping and he peed on me. I am furious, all he says it's that it really turns him on and that I allowed him to do it before. He doesn't understand that I actually have a problem with it. 

So what should I do? I really love this guy and I don't want to break up with him, but this situation is literally sticky.

He's 23 years old, I'm 21 (F). We've been together for 3 years and everything in general is great between us, or so I thought. When we met I was about 135-140 pounds, 5''7. After starting birth control, and just being in the college cafeteria I ended up gaining about 3-5 pounds and my weight fluctuated between 140-145. My boobs went up a size, but all my clothes fit (wearing a U.S 6) so it didn't really bother me too much. About a year into our relationship I started having some medical issues where my stomach wasn't digesting right and I gained a sufficient amount of weight in a couple of months. I went up to 155 pounds, and it was a noticeable change. The GI doctor gave my some antibiotics, I ended up getting pregnant during this time.  

I gained a ton of weight during my pregnancy. I was stupid, depressed and ate for triplets. I ended up putting around 70 pounds by the day I delivered my daughter. As of now I weigh around 185 pounds, so I have about 25-30 pounds to lose to get to my pre-pregnancy weight. I've been really struggling to lose the weight. I never dieted and really paid attention to what I ate too much, and I'm having a hard time in the self-control area. I diet for a week, then stop, go back up again. It's just a yo-yo, and it's terrible. 

I'm very clearly upset about my weight. I struggle a lot with being so young and having this ""mom"" figure. I openly talk about it with my boyfriend, so he knows it's a sensitive subject. The past couple days, all week he's been kind of reserved and not his self. He has his GRE's coming tomorrow, so I figured he was just stressed and studying a lot before the big day, so I tried to be extra sweet and understanding. Yesterday, we're sitting down at lunch he blurts out of no where that he's sick of my being fat. That he's not attracted to overweight girls, and that our daughter is over a year now and still I'm yet to lose all the baby weight. 

Obviously, I'm really hurt by this. I feel like all the times we've had sex for the past year and he acted turned on by my body was a lie. I feel so unattractive and hurt. What bothers me most about everything I think, was how he said it. He pretty much just said that he has needs, and he's only getting sex from me and that I should care more about looking good for him. How I put effort with what I wear, my make-up, my hair, but my body which bothers me most, and him the most I don't care enough about to change. 

I'm trying not to show how hurt I am about what he said, but I don't know how.... What do I do? Everything is so awkward between us now. Maybe I'm not even looking for advice, I guess it's more of a rant. 

**tl;dr** A year later I'm still struggling to lose the baby weight. Boyfriend said he's fed up with me not losing the last 25 pounds and is sexually not attracted to me. My feelings are hurt, but I understand where he's coming from. More of a rant, then looking for advice. Any words of wisdom from someone who's been there?

He tells me how he is preparing for the weekend – doing things around his house to make her feel comfortable.  Things like: buying Pink sheets for his bed, Pink pillows and blankets in the living room (her fav color is pink), buying dolphin bathroom accessories (she likes dolphins), printing off ALL of the pictures she has sent him of her and her six year old son (including one of him only in his underwear).  He lives out in the middle of nowhere – forty minutes to the closest small town – in a cabin on a lake.  She walks into his rustic cabin – and sees all this pink stuff and dolphins – odd for a man in his forties.  But, flips out when she sees pics of her framed all over his house – especially the pic of her son in his underwear on his fridge!  He doesn’t see what he did wrong – he was “just trying to make her feel more comfortable in his house.” She left a few hours after she arrived. He is heartbroken and asking me for advice.  How do I tell him that he is super creepy?  I don’t want to hurt him, and know the truth would.

In the beginning it was kind of secretive -- neither one of us was looking for a commitment and that was fine, but it was never just a ""fuck buddy"" or ""friends with benefits"" thing. Things never felt ""casual"", especially in the last few months. About six weeks ago I realized I was in love with him. 

I never told him. 

Last night we were talking about Christmas and he interrupted me to say ""I love you"". I was so relieved. I started to cry. He then said, ""But I'm not IN love with you."" 

He is my best friend. I absolutely adore him. He says he wants to be in love, he wants to think about settling down -- just not with me.

I'm crushed, but I guess I'd rather we do things this way and still remain friends than for him to continue to ""half ass"" our relationship until he finds someone else. 

This was like a bolt out of the blue. I just saw him last weekend and everything was fine. He's been more affectionate lately than ever. I really thought that things were getting better and then he breaks up with me out of absolutely nowhere. There was no distancing, no hesitation, no writing on the wall -- nothing. 

In the 24 hours that have transpired since our conversation I've been on an emotional roller coaster. I think I've actually cycled through the stages of grief. One minute I feel nothing, then I feel happy, then I'm in tears again.

I don't know what I'm looking for here by posting this, I just needed to put this all in words and tell *someone*. 

The worst part about all of this is that he's the only guy I've ever dated who has treated me decently. I don't know what to do now.

Clearly not. 

Back Story:I got downvoted a few months ago for a comment about something I wanted to get my son for a gift (which I guessed was him but dismissed for lack of evidence). The gift was a fairly big purchase for me - something that I saved up for and went to a lot of trouble to get for this xmas - but....I just found out that my ex purchased the EXACT SAME THING and gave it to my son 2 weeks early! Never mind that he's behind on child support, joint debt, medical bills that are his responsibility, etc etc....he did this as a way to make sure that HE could be the hero in my son's eyes for xmas this year - he did it to spite me(trust me - I know this based on many failed attempts at split-family counseling and many years of his ever-growing paranoia). 

I'm angry beyond belief about the situation with the gift and his need for competition - which I wont get into here, but I'm also frustrated because he's apparently STILL stalking me.

I've been a Redditor for many years now, participated in 2 seasons of Reddit Gifts, am a Charter Member of Reddit Gold, etc...and now I feel - thanks to there apparently being no way to transfer these titles and such to another account - even under circumstances like ""stalking"" - I'm having to start all over. 
Don't know if anyone has any advice or anything, but I'd love to hear something useful on the matter.

I know a username on Reddit isn't everything, but I'm annoyed that after needing to change so much in my life in order to remove this lying, cheating, stealing, deadbeat sociopath from my life - I feel like I shouldn't HAVE to do this too (aka - there should be a way). 

Sorry for the vent...

Edit:Typos :/

Edit2: Updated comments - Please do not misunderstand my intentions here. The REAL issues about my ex's insanity are being dealt with as best I can OUTSIDE of this forum. From experience, many people have worse situations than mine, but again, that's not the true topic here. 
Yes, I've been told by several professionals (even within the court system and supporting factions) that he's a nightmare and not right in the head - but the way that the laws are written - sometimes we have no recourse. 

The PURPOSE of this thread was more or less to vent and to get some perspective on an issue that I know many people have raised about not being able move things around - if needed due to something like this. As anyone who's ever gone through a divorce that isn't ""calm"" can tell you - the amount of your time, identity, etc that you have to give up in order to start over can get overwhelming. I'm not complaining as much as venting. Maybe I will do an AMA or AMAA about it so we can discuss all the ways that I can regain control over my life and the lives of my family - but in the meantime....yeah - here's where I am.

Me: F, 26.
Boyfriend: 30.
Together for 8 months, took it slow but have gotten more serious.  I apologize, I am a wordy writer. 

I get home from work on Tuesday, and am going through the usual routine: mail, dishes, what to make for dinner, etc.  I get on my laptop and see that my boyfriend had left his google voice history open from the day before.  Instead of just clicking out of it, I find myself a little curious so I click on the History tab.  I don't know why I did it, I really didn't expect to see anything.  He leaves it open while at his apartment all the time, so it's not like I've ever had a reason to think he's hiding anything from me.

Well lo and behold, what is the first thing I see?  A couple of texts sent to his ex-girlfriend, with use of pet names (they have been broken up for over a year now).  When we first got together he told me that they completely cut each other off when they broke up and that they don't talk.  I freak out.  I can't control myself and start looking for other texts to/from her.  

The next one that comes up is from this past Friday, sent by him to her around 1am.  It says something like ""I wanna see you so bad right now.""  At this point my heart is beating a mile a minute and I have what feels like a boulder sinking in my stomach.  I continue to look for more texts, don't find anything, skip way ahead and see something from March.  It's a long texting correspondence between the two, pretty harmless but still somewhat flirtatious. It took place just a few days after we had gotten back from our first vacation together.

At this point I am shaking, disgusted, unable to think straight.  I sign out of his account.  I call him, let it ring once and hang up.  I wait 20 minutes and try to calm downm, but instead feel worse, the most horrible thoughts going through my head.  I want to puke.  I'm thinking the worst of the worst.  I am ready to break up with him.  I call again, he answers.  I am calm, I explain slowly and clearly what happened.  I am clear that it was not my intention to go through his history, but when I saw her name I freaked out.  I didn't look at any other correspondence with anyone, just hers.  

He tells me that I am reading way too much into this.  Yes they have been talking recently, but mostly through facebook and the occaisional text.  I say that I have no problem with him communicating with her, but it was quite a surprise to see that since I was under the impression that they don't talk at all.  I also say that the text sent from him to her at 1am is extremely suggestive and that I can only think the worst when I see that.  He says he doesn't even remember sending it, he was drunk that night. 

He calms me down, assures me that I have nothing to worry about, they haven't seen each other since they broke up and he certainly doesn't plan on it.  It comes up that they have been talking for a few months now, but he claims she always initiates it.  She is still having a hard time with the breakup and is a very needy person.  And he says that while he knows that things are over between them, it is still hard for him.

I start to relax a little. When I ask him if he has told her about our relationship, he is quiet.  I ask him again, he says that no, he hasn't.  This gets me riled up again.  How can he correspond with her, for months, and not say anything?!  Surely she has asked him, especially if she is as needy as he claims she is.  He says that he can't tell her because she will freak out and in her classic manipulative way, tell all of their past mutual friends and set them against her (whatever, grow a pair!).  He also says that their breakup was very difficult for both of them.  I am understanding of this, having had my own share of rough breakups and recovery periods.

We make plans to meet later in the week (tonight) and talk about it more.  After we get off the phone I feel better for a few minutes, but I can't get this out of my mind.  Especially that 1am text.  I feel broken, this is a huge breach of trust.  I can't eat, can't sleep.  I compose a long and thought-out email explaining how I feel.  I say that it is disrespectful to both me and to her to not tell her that he is in a relationship.  It is dishonest.  It certainly isn't helping her to move on with her life. 

As I am writing the email, I realize that what it really boils down to is that he has problems being open with me.  If he had told me earlier that they talked, I wouldn't have freaked out when I saw the text.  He replies to my email the next day saying that yes, he hasn't been open with me, but that I have to understand that after he broke up with her, he wasn't sure if he ever wanted to put himself out there again.  Due to his emotional distance, I have also made myself somewhat distant.  And due to this, it feels good to talk to her once in awhile.

I love him so much and I want to work this out.  He says he wants to try to.  But I still can't get over this, I feel betrayed.  I know that it's only been a few days and that with time I will feel better, but I am still afraid I won't be able to trust him like I used to. But the truth is, I love him enough to try my hardest to work past the whole incident.  I just don't know how confident I am that he feels the same. 

I don't really know what to do, so I guess I would just like to hear some thoughts about his actions....is he being a total douchebag?  Am I being too forgiving? I just want some perspective before I see him tonight.  Thank you all so much. 

Edit:  I am off to his place for the talk.  Nervous as hell because I have no idea how this will go.  Thanks to everyone for your advice.  I feel stronger now and am confident that I will do the right thing if he can't prove that he's going to commit to me and only me.  Will update with results.

My girlfriend had already eaten dinner (spaghetti).  Presumably, she ate until she was full.  I warmed up a plate and sat down with her in front of the TV...and she asked me if she could have some of my food.

What gives here?  I mean, I figure, she already ate spaghetti, why does she want more?  I assume if she wanted more she could have made another bowl for herself, but something about my food is just irresistable.

This pretty much goes without saying whenever I order french fries.  Does she want her own fries?  Of course not...she wants *my* fries.  Which always leaves me in a position of having just a few fries fewer than I actually wanted...like when you drop the last bite of a candy bar, it's so disappointing.

So, I put it to you, ladies:  If you want food, why don't you just get your own food?  Why do you have to pick at your man's food?

Update:  All this thread is missing to make it an archetypical R_A thread is for someone to suggest I dump her for eating my fries.

He used to be this sweet, shy, nerdy guy. 

I am completely overwhelmed by what he has told me tonight and have no idea how to respond to any of this. I still can't help but think of the old him that I'm still in love with, and can't help but feel like I'm making a mistake. Like maybe he'll return to his old self...

Here's some back-story:

For the past year or two, he's slowly become increasingly mean to everyone around him, myself included. I've noticed that he acts snobbish to most people (myself included again), and says very shallow, closed minded, and downright mean things. He has been significantly less empathetic and seems unconcerned with the goings-ons of everyone around him. He no longer has friends, but has made a lot of enemies, which he would brag to me about regularly. I've been hoping he'd revert back to his old ways for way too long, but it's just snowballed. He's even withdrawn from me, only visiting shortly every few days or so, and only sends me a few text messages on the days we don't see each other. 

I am not making this shit up that you are about to read.

Today, he was drunk, and told me that he thinks of people's value mostly in terms of how much money they make, and what kind of education they have. He stated that he was no longer interested in emotions or attachments to other people, and that if he ever had a family, he would just give them a lot of money instead of getting too involved with them, because money is what makes people happy. He said he has always been searching for someone who would understand that he is ""socially and emotionally inept"" and be okay with it. He said he expected to die alone and that he was okay with this. 

He is obsessed with computer science, and works on coding nonstop. He no longer does anything he enjoys other than coding except for the occasional online poker tournament. I told him I thought he'd eventually wish he just got away from the computer to live his life, but he said that computers make him feel alive like no people do, and that this was his only contribution to society. He kept talking about how he was not interested in emotions and feelings, stating that all they did was cloud logic... He said he was only concerned with himself and dedicating his life to computer science.

tl;dr Boyfriend insists that people and emotional attachments are only distractions to keep him from doing his coding, has become generally mean and cold hearted to just about everyone (me, old friends, acquaintances), sees life as a distraction from his writing code

I moved out of my mom's house at 18 to go to college but have recently moved back into her basement because I lost a job and am playing catch-up on my coursework. When I had my own apartment, it was great because my boyfriend would come over and we would drink, have sexytimes, etc. When it came time for me to move, I mentioned that it would be a bit further away and he took a few days to think about whether or not he wanted to continue the relationship since I would be about an hour-90 minutes away and living with my mom, limiting our private time. He inevitably decided that he wants to stay together because he sees himself with me in the long run. Great! The only problem is that I'm embarrassed to have him come over to my mom's house. 

He comes from a well-off family with several acres of land, horses, a large house, etc. My mom's house is in a very affluent town, but is a bit modest compared to the other neighborhoods in the community. Ever since my father passed away several years ago, her house has not been very well maintained. It is not only an older house, but there are many repairs that need to be done and the basic up-keep is just lacking. There is also an abundance of stuff because 4 people lived in this house for many years and she is just not able to keep up with everything. 

That being said, when it came time for me to move in, I did not hesitate to help out with some of these things; I painted the basement, have helped with a lot of trash removal, laundry, organizing, etc. It just seems like we still have a LONG way to go, and we are limited on finances. Even after some improvement, I'm still embarrassed to have him come over and see what state the house is in. 

TL;DR - He lives in a beautiful home, is on track with his school, and has a steady job.

I met her on the bus ride home and I got her pregnant. I did what I thought was responsible and stayed with her for my baby. She turned out to be a nice person but she isn't in touch with reality. She had a miscarriage and rather than tell me she decided the best thing to do was to get pregnant again before I found out. When I did I broke up with her. This lasted only a few months until she had our daughter. I would go to visit and it broke my heart to leave every time and eventually let her move in with me again. 

Fast forward to now. I have a business, my daughter is 9 months old and my wife has actually take a couple steps in the opposite direction and is now on methadone after a drug relapse.

She refuses to grow as a person in any sort of way. She constantly brings drama we don't need into our lives by lying constantly about things that don't even matter. However, she's a great mother and does everything for me. Cooks, cleans and takes care of our daughter while I build the business. 

Help me please. What do I do? I'm so inexperienced in life and feel like the only way to be safe is to make money and provide for the family. I have no problem doing this but I'm depressed and always tired from the long hours. Oh god I feel so helpless.

It's never been a problem before, and there has never been any issue of jealousy on either part, but I'm beginning to feel a bit uneasy about the current situation. 

His friend brought a girl to my graduation party last night that is supposedly interested in the two of us. She ended up leaving fairly early but seemed like a cool chick. This morning when I woke up, however, I gave him a call and he was out to breakfast with the girl. 

Am I right in feeling jealous about this or overreacting? It may just be that he's trying to get things to work out in our benefit, but the fact that he didn't try to call or invite me kind of makes me feel like he's doing something behind my back. Then again, it's probably all in my head...

Edit/Update: Thank you for all the responses that I got, you were all very supportive and encouraging! I spoke to the bf and it turns out I was just very uninformed about the whole situation; what I thought was a ""sure thing"" was just a vibe that he got from the girl when she said things like ""you and your girlfriend are really cool, we should definitely hang out more"". In the morning, he got a call from his friend (who brought the girl to begin with) and she began telling him about their crazy night. She mentioned that they were going to breakfast around the corner and he figured he would go there and drink some coffee while he wait for me to call him when I woke up. When I did call, he was sitting there with them and I (in my not completely sober state) misconstrued the entire situation. 

In other words; false alarm. But I'm glad we talked about things before there was an actual issue. He apologized for not being clear to me but was also really hurt that I would ever think that he would ever do anything behind my back. Thanks again for the great responses!!

What do I do?,weightlossmarriage,71,16,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1fbcnj/i_think_my_weight_loss_has_ruined_my_marriage/,"My husband and I were having a heart-to-heart today about unrelated issues when he opened up to be about the fact that he isn't happy with my weight loss. When we met, I was 230-240ish and got up to 260 before deciding to lose weight. I'm now 145. He supported me through the entire 3 year process of losing weight and kept me on track. So I feel thrown for a loop when he says he wished I was 170-180. That he preferred me at that weight. It's not like he's unhealthy and trying to keep me unhealthy. He's always been a healthy person. He bikes, is a normal weight, a healthy eater. After opening up about this, he tried pressuring/talking me to agree to gaining weight to get to 170-180, but I told him point blank that I don't want to gain weight. I'm happy with the way I look and the weight I am. He tried bribing me. I'm planning a solo Italy trip because he won't travel and he said that he would go if I agreed to gain weight. He said he would even go to therapy for his anxiety issues. Both of those things he's absolutely refused to consider before. He's even willing to do other unmentioned things to get me to agree to gain weight. But I simply don't want to. I know that I'll be unhappy at that weight. Otherwise, I would have stopped at that weight. So what do I do? He can't help what he's physically attracted to, but I am unwilling to gain weight after spending 3 years losing it.

**EDIT:**

After a really shitty night, I woke up this morning and he wanted to talk some more. He asked if I was willing to go to 160-165 since last I said that was the highest I would ever be willing to go to since it was my original goal weight. He said he would still go to Italy with me. I asked if he would still go to therapy for his anxiety problems. He said no and I told him I'd rather him go into therapy for his anxiety than to go with me to Italy. He said that was fine as long as I agree to gain a little bit of weight. And he asked how long I wanted him in therapy and I told him as long as it takes for his anxiety to be treated. He wasn't too thrilled about that, but he agreed. 

He asked if I would be resentful if I went to 160-165 and I told him honestly that I didn't know. I never once thought he would be unsupportive of my weight loss since he was there helping me along the way.

I just don't know why this is even an issue. I prefer muscular men. My husband is 5'10 and 130 lbs. So what? That's why I just can't figure out why this is such a big deal to him.

I love him, so if it gets him into therapy for his anxiety issues, I'd consider going to 160-165. I don't know if I'll be happy or unhappy, but it's worth a try. I'm at 145 right now, so it's not a big leap. My main thing is he's needed therapy for his anxiety for awhile and hasn't wanted to seek help. I did tell him that if I gain weight to 160-165 and am unhappy, then I won't stay at that weight.

**EDIT 2:**

I have written a letter to my husband, which I will give him this afternoon when I get home from work. I know that most of you will not agree with my decision, but life isn't perfect or idealistic. Life also isn't black and white. I think at this point, it is the right decision. Whether that will still be the case next year, no one knows. In case anyone is interested, here is the letter: 

""You hurt me last night even though I know that was not your intention. It doesn’t help that we had just discussed and worked through my feelings regarding the fact that we never do anything with one another other than walk, do chores, and have sex. I guess I am more hurt by the fact that my weight loss took 3 years to accomplish and you never once confided in me. You pushed me to continue exercising and dieting whenever I wanted to quit and you encouraged me to take measurements and pictures so that I could see the progress I was making. When I let my loose skin get to me, you tell me that you would rather I was healthy with loose skin than morbidly obese. I feel like that was all a lie. I feel like the last 3 years were for nothing and that you have lied to me for our entire marriage. We are husband and wife and I’m deeply hurt that you kept such an important part of your thoughts away from me. 

For once in my life, I was truly happy with my body and the way I looked. I liked the way I looked in the mirror and the way I looked in my clothes. Now that has been taken away from me, and I don’t know how to process it. I know that I would be miserable at 170 or 180 pounds. I don’t know if I’ll be unhappy with my body at 165 since it was my initial goal weight. I’m afraid that I will grow to resent you for pressuring me into gaining weight when I don’t want to. If I get to 165 pounds and I am unhappy, what then? If I go back down to 145 pounds, we are back where we are now. If I get to 165 pounds and am happy, will you eventually start pressuring me to gain more weight? 

There is nothing wrong with preferring a certain build, but I do not think it is right to pressure a significant other to physically change to accommodate a preference. Losing weight was for me but gaining weight will be for you. I like muscular builds, but I would never pressure you into going to the gym and becoming someone you aren’t. Preferences are just that; they are preferences. I feel like you are requiring me to look a certain way in order for you to be happy with me. The fact that you tried to bribe me with visits to see my nephew and my Italy trip offend me. I deserve more consideration than that. I am your wife. You should want to see your nephew. You should want to see Italy with me since it would make me happy, your wife. I should not have to physically change myself in order for that to happen.

Now that I have aired my feelings, there are two things I want to happen before I will actually agree to gain weight to 165 pounds. One, I want you to begin therapy for your anxiety. Once a month, I want to go with you to your session because I need to learn how to properly help you with your anxiety. This joint session can also serve as marriage counseling because I need someone to talk to about all of this. I have no one to turn to since you have requested it stay between us. Marriage should not be this hard, and I believe that counseling can help us. Two, I want you to discuss and consider anxiety medication with your therapist. I know you don’t want to take medication, but anxiety is an actual mental condition that can be treated with the proper medication. It is no different than bipolar disorder. Medication will no more negatively affect your body than birth control affects mine. Your first prescription will not be the perfect one. It takes time, but I want you to discuss it with your therapist and seriously consider it.

While not a requirement, I do want you to go with me to Italy. There is no other person who I would want to experience Italy with than you. I hope that you will eventually agree to go with me because you want to go and make me happy. And I want you to get to know your nephew. I think you would make an excellent uncle, but that won’t happen if you only see your nephew once a year.

I hope you will consider everything I have said in this letter and know that I love you. I only want what is best for you, me, and our relationship.""

**FINAL EDIT: When I got home from work today, my husband and I sat down and a very in-depth heart to heart. I gave him my letter and read the letter he had written to me. We hashed out everything and even revealed other things about ourselves that I won't get into here. But the bottom line is he has agreed to therapy and medication. I have agreed to gain to 165. Part of it is for him, but another part of it is for me. I've been so focused on counting every calorie and having tunnel vision on a particular number, I haven't considered what weight I would truly be happy at. Frankly, I'm not happy at my current weight because of loose skin and stretch marks. 165 was my goal weight at one point because I remember being happy at that size when I was in high school. I love food and in the process of getting to 145, I have spent 3 years critiquing everything that went into my mouth. I lost the joy in food. 165 is just a number like 145. I will still be healthy at 165. I want to thank you all for giving me your advice, good or bad. You allowed me to put my thoughts to words and formulate how I did or did not feel.

Just wanted to address one thing first, some people said i was being a bit over dramatic, and I can agree with you to a certain extent. I know I'm young, but I felt like if this girl ever asked me to marry her (cause it's not uncommon for girls to pop the question nowa days), I wouldn't of had the balls to say no, and would of been stuck in that relationship. *which I shortly found out afterwards that she was going to ask me to marry her :/*

Now onto the update.

I broke up with her. We were arguing on the phone the day after I posted the original, and of course it was over something ridiculous, and I just let it all out and ultimately told her I was unhappy and I couldn't do it any more. Immediately she started with the accusations and trying to make mee feel guilty and thanks to the things some of you said in the comments I stayed head strong and didn't give in. She went from hanging up on me, to calling me and begging, to being a total ass cause I wasn't giving in. We haven't talked much lately, she has texted me apologizing quite a bit though. 

I am happy, I wake up and I don't feel like I'm drowning anymore. I sleep freaking amazingly, but I do think about her quite a bit, which I'm sure is normal. I mean this is my first real relationshp, and my first real break up. I don't have the urge to go out hook up, I haven't tried talking to girls that have literally thrown themselves at me since I changed my Facebook relationship status, lol. I miss her, but I miss who I used to be more. I love her, but it's not the type of love that makes you want to be with someone for the rest of your life.

I work 40-50 hours depending on overtime as an engineer and I'm having to come home and cook dinner and clean the kitchen and house. Granted,  we just moved in and the place is a mess but I was able to get all of my things out of my boxes working through the fatigue.

Now my husband, works part-time (32 hours) in retail and leaves things laying about including his socks and jeans in the living room. When I tell him to pick it up, he puts it off and says I will do it later and next thing you know, its the next day. He says I should give him some slack because he's tired.

Rewind a couple of months before we got married/lived together, he promised that he would help me out with the cooking and cleaning and that ""it would be fun.""

Fast forward to present day and he's doing the exact opposite and what's more, he's complaining that the sex has gone down. But honestly, I cook dinner for him, prepare his lunch for work, pick up his things, AND work full time---I just feel like his mother after that. He doesn't show affection or show me any respect; he just leaves his stuff around and getting him to do housework is a challenge. After all that... I just don't feel like sex. The fact that I have to pick up his dirty underwear to put in the hamper is a huge turn off.

His reason being is that he works in retail and just wants to relax. I would like to relax, too. I'd like to lay down and read a book when I get home but I'd have to cook and clean when I get home. Don't get me wrong, I am in love with cooking. I love it but its hard to cook when I have to think about picking up the slack for that other person. And seeing him sitting on the couch with his feet up is a huge turn off.

Does anyone have any advice? I'd like to save my marriage. We just started and I feel like its not going to get any better. I want to feel like his lover again and make love with him--not feel like he married me so I can be his mother.

EDIT/Update:
Thank you everyone for the great insights! I have talked to my husband about it and sat him down. He was amazingly responsive especially when I told him why sex has been on the decline. I hope things change for the better but of course these things will take time. I do know that I have to work on myself as well especially since I am living with someone else and my standards may or may not match theirs.

I logged into his FB and saw him messaging other girls that are beyond the well-communicated/established boundaries we previously discussed as far as talking to other girls go, since [this is not the first time I caught him doing this](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/104yxt/20f_snooped_through_my_boyfriends_26m_throwaway/). Yeah, yeah, I know you're not supposed to invade your SO's privacy; I realize I'm in the wrong about that. However, last time I did that I knew he had something he was trying to hide, and I was right. Had the same feeling today, and I was right again: [he was shamelessly flirting and talking about sexual things not appropriate with female friends](http://imgur.com/a/M2N5s). I caught him doing the same on reddit a couple of months ago when we just moved in together; this time, he started doing it on FB as he was living with me in my apartment rent-free, while I was there keeping him company after school [he was taking off time for work because of a hemorrhage in his eye that left him half blind].

Since the first incident, I realized we had some communication issues. Things were not said out of hurting the other's feelings, I was unavailable a lot because of school, etc etc. Since then I've worked very hard on improving my communication with him, and it doesn't seem to have made the slightest impression on him in the end.

That's all beside the point. I believe in second chances, and gave him one in August. He fucked it up, and I now am adamant about leaving him and not taking him back.

The problem is his family: ***I love them.*** So, so much. His family has done nothing but treat me with kindness, welcome, and a generosity so overwhelming that it hurts. One of the biggest regrets I have about ending this relationship is the likelihood that I'll lose them, and they're the closest thing I have to friends and family in my big university town. I have a feeling that once we officially break up, he's going to give his whole family a very watered-down version of the story.

My question is, would it be wrong for me to e-mail his parents, not only to say how grateful I am for everything that they and his grandparents have done for me, as well as how much I value my relationship with them, but to also explain my reasoning for breaking up? I realize topics such as cheating and breakups are such intimate affairs that normally shouldn't extend to unrelated family members. However, I feel like once he tells them his version of the story, whatever that may be, they'll want nothing to do with me. While of course, family would have to side with family, but I don't want them to choose sides at all; I just want them to know the truth. That he was inappropriately messaging other girls, and that I wouldn't stand for it. At the very least, I want to remain on ""friendly"" terms with his family, so that I can stop by and say hello to them every now and then, without having to worry about them shunning me. I want them to know how much I appreciate them, and that I don't want to entirely lose my relationships with them, but I can't necessarily do that if my bf gives a one-sided story. 

**TL;DR, definitely planning on breaking up with my boyfriend. However, I don't want to totally break up with his family, and want to at least remain on friendly terms with them. Would it be wrong to e-mail them explaining(leaving out the explicit details) why I decided to abruptly break up with their son before the holidays?**

*EDIT: Everyone is right. I have decided that I will contact them by sending them a card, telling them how much I am grateful for all their kindness this past year and a half, and will make sure to leave out the dirty details. Like I said before, I'm not trying to make them pick sides.

A relationship is nothing more than a friendship (if I'm not mistaken) taken to a different level. Is it possible for me to ever be in a relationship since I don't even maintain close personal frendships?

I'm just concerned that I'm so inexperienced with fiends in general that it would be nearly impossible to form a true relationship.

I was hoping to get some advice from other guys on how they deal with dating girls they think are way out of their league. For some context, I'm 24 years old and 225lb dating a 10, perfectly fit 30 year old who is 5'3 and 90lb. She looks amazing in a Bikini, whereas I won't even take my shirt off in fear of scaring nearby children. I'm always worried some muscle guy will come up and start hitting on her and I'll just look like a huge fat tool who has no clue what hes doing with his girlfriend. (She never talks to or flirts with any guys, all of these problems are in my head, but I still think I'm too easily intimidated by other males of my species)

Any other guys out there that aren't so fit who are dating some girl who gets way more attention than them? I'd love to hear stories, at the very least just so I can relate and not feel so weird about the situation I'm in.

Edit: Thanks for all the replies! I already feel a ton better about the situation.

1343836654.0,51,self.relationship_advice,xie5i,[28/m] wondering if traditional no sex/no cohabitation/no foreplay rules [27/f] till marriage actually lead to a stronger marriage?,RSWbyssw1,71,20,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/xie5i/28m_wondering_if_traditional_no_sexno/,"My girlfriend 27 has grown up with a very strong set of beliefs that there should be no sex/foreplay/cohabitation till marriage, subsequently she has never had a solid relationship, has never had sex or fallen in love. To put things in perspective, she had recently achieved (her first) orgasm one night I had helped her though her cloths.

So here we are dating... going out to dinner a few times a week, making out on the couch like teenagers. If I press her too far sexually, she then regresses back and that is not done for a few weeks. Meanwhile I am thinking, that I will never be close enough to marry her if we are not progressing the relationship (foreplay, spending the night, maybe even moving in with each other at some point).

--------------------------------------------

When I asked her values she states the following. :

""I dont want to be test ridden like a car"".

""If I am going to act like the wife, why not become the wife"".

""Its harder to just walk away when you are married"".

""I would feel less of my self if I was living with someone who did not marry me"".

""Marriage is great for taxes"".

""I need to be engaged before we do anything more than we are currently doing"".

""I know you want to buy a house, but I wont move in unless we are married (once we are married I want us to buy a joint house together so were both on the title and the partner could never say ""this is MY house"".

""We could sign a prenump if you want"".


--------------------------------------------------

Like this is some formula for a relationship, minus the love that would somehow fall into a good relationship.

I dont see any of this shit above.. I want basic love, love that would flourish into a normal sexual life, and progress into a strong relationship, then marriage.

I currently feel none of this and here is she talking about heavy, outdated formal dating. Dont get me wrong I like this girl, but every time she talks about this I drift further apart.

**TLDR Current (relationship novice) girlfriend is making me jump through all the traditional dating to marriage hoops like its some sort of magic formula for a successful marriage, I am not feeling any of this and see it as a receipt for disaster.**

She wants to have the talk tonight, so this may actually be the end... we shall see.

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

1342115023.0,56,self.relationship_advice,wgaaf,My boyfriend [28m] of 3 years is hanging out with a 19 year old. Not really thrilled.,HolyCrapItsABug,72,16,154,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wgaaf/my_boyfriend_28m_of_3_years_is_hanging_out_with_a/,"I'm a (28/f), and have been with this guy for about three years. Our relationship has been extremely good, but lately it's been slightly rocky. We moved out of an extremely hostile household, which was causing us to have problems. Going home was causing stress, so we started bickering etc.. 

During that time, he met a girl (we'll call her Laura) at an event he goes to every year. I wasn't able to go with him this year due to travel constraints, but he had fun, etc etc. It's not unusual to meet a ton of new people at these events, including young people like herself. But he made friends with her outside of it, and then started texting her.

Well, he works the late night shift, and what started my whole problem was he (yes, I saw his texts, I'm a horrible girlfriend - his phone kept fucking buzzing so I went to see who was texting him while he was in the shower, and it was her NONSTOP jesus christ - normally we have no issue sharing texts though, I read them to him and vice versa if driving / whatever) was texting her saying ""I can only text you at work, my girlfriend can't find out."" 

WTF. This was the same day we almost broke up (first time), didn't, had a flipping cryfest practically, and then made a commitment to each other to get out of that hellhouse, as we realized it was a lot of the problem.

I didn't say anything. I was pissed, and I figured it was a lapse in judgement. He works a graveyard shift, so he went to work, etc. He comes back in the morning, goes to sleep. I'm a mess at this point, so I read his texts - and he had been texting her all night. Nothing sexual or flirty, but he invited her to come hang out that following evening at work. She asked if I'd be pissed if she went, and his response was, ""If she found out, lol"".

Needless to say, I found out. I gave him the chance to fess up, and he did. He apologized, we discussed depression and various problems, etc etc. He cancelled on her, so she never stopped by. His reasoning was I'd be jealous, and so he didn't want me to be upset, then realized how fucking stupid that sounded.

So now you know the backstory to this girl.

She's actually very nice. As I've gotten to know her, I've realized that his idea of her is more of a little sister type role. His little sister is on the other side of the country and has a new boyfriend, so they never talk anymore. This makes him ridiculously bummed out, and this girl is around the same age, so I'm thinking she's a replacement almost. His sister and him texted all the time, and I've seen their convos - nothing nuts.

Buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut...

She has a HUGE crush on him. I can tell. I've been the 19 year girl with a crush on an older guy, and she's doing pretty much *everything* I've done. She's even complaining about her boyfriend, and how he doesn't want her to ""dress sexy"" or some crap. My boyfriend deflects these comments and moves on to something else, but she's *trying*.

Mostly I tease my boyfriend about it now, because on one hand I find it sort of hilarious, but on the other hand, he keeps hanging out with her. I don't want to tell him he can't have a new friend, but because of 1.) the age discrepancy and 2.) how they became friends and **I** found out about her, it's been really fucking difficult. She's been nice enough to try and include me when she invites him places (sometimes), but she got drunk the other night at her party she threw, and was practically all over him. 

Is this a no-brainer? Should a 28 year old man not be hanging with a 19 year old girl? Or am I being a jealous girlfriend and need to back off? I need some advice here.

Also - we've since moved out of the hellhouse. Things have been MUCH better since. Less / no stress, etc etc.

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend is hanging out with a 19 year old who had a poor introduction. I want to let him have his new friend, who is a nice girl, but I'm having jealousy issues (?). Mistrust? I don't know what it is. I'd be happier if they didn't hang out, but I can't tell him that. wat 2 do?

**edit**: They are not sneaking behind my back or anything anymore. This happened *once*, shortly after they met at their event, and right after our breakup fight. They haven't hung out since without my knowledge / consent. He's not being shady regarding communicating / hanging with her.

**UPDATE:** I talked to him tonight about me being uncomfortable, and how she's probably seeing the situation. (I also included the advice regarding how she sees how he treated me disrespectfully, so she thinks he doesn't value the relationship - thanks!!) He admitted he didn't realize it was this bad, and then said he's never had girls chase after him before that didn't become his girlfriend (ie: no one's gone after him / flirted with him while he's been in a relationship), so he doesn't really understand how it works. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt in this situation. He said he'd stop texting her, and only text back when she texts him first.. and also cut down on how much he responds, as well as not responding immediately so she doesn't think he's at her beck and call.

She also won't be visiting him anymore at work, unless I'm stopping by and can hang out with them. He was extremely receptive to all of this, and thanks to everyone's advice, I was able to give very logical, and rational reasons without getting emotional about it. **THANK YOU!**",,False,,t5_2r0cn,1342169763.0,,,True,t3_wgaaf,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wgaaf/my_boyfriend_28m_of_3_years_is_hanging_out_with_a/,

This has had in the past sometimes a negative effect on my partnership. Since networking is important for me in business and in private, I tried to come up with some ""rules"" for myself to avoid jealousy and insecurities and annoyance on both sides:

-  I would never risk my partnership for a friend.

- Absolutely no omitting, hiding or lying about seeing the friend. Not even if there was a previous jealousy issue. I see it this way: If I hide seeing someone, I have a reason to hide him. I never lock my phone, Facebook or my email account when with my partner. He can read any of my texts, emails, chats because I have nothing to hide.

- I introduce my partner to all my guy friends that I knew before him and try to explain the relationship to him as detailed as possible. ~~I do omit sexual relationships but if he asks I will be honest about it.~~  ^1

- No sleep overs! No matter if there is a snow storm or all trains, cabs and busses are on strike. I'd rather walk alone and if my friend is a real friend, he'll walk me home.

- If I meet a new person that I'd like to include into my social circle, I tell my partner right away and introduce them to each other at the earliest opportunity.  

- I clearly stand to my partner in public and show him by action that the nature of my friendship is not sexually or emotionally motivated.

-  No bonding on an emotional level or ""emotional relationship"". I take care not to fall into a flirtatious or intimate conversation style. If the friend does so, I let him know that it is not appropriate. From personal experience I find emotional cheating MUCH more painful and harder to cure than a physical relationship. I wouldn't want my partner to go through this.

- If my partner doesn't like the friend, I respect that. Sometimes there are no logical reasons for jealousy and he is after all my partner and my number 1.   ~~I would never risk my partnership for a friend.~~ ^2 I still tell him however that I wish to see my friend and offer him to join. Often times he learns there is nothing to fear and he becomes friendly with the person too.



What do you have to add? Do you think any of my guidelines are to obsessive or to weak? Do you know any literature on the subject? I would like to add your thoughts to this list. Please share with me :)

It's not. At our age (mid thirties) it's a whole different thing with real childhood friends - those that stayed on after you moved seven times around the world, those that walked with you through the death of a parent, experienced your break-ups and fights with other childhood friends, those will never go. They are stuck to you for life and it doesn't matter if you talk to them daily or if you only see them once in a year, your relationship doesn't change.

She's very worried about sex being painful the first time, so she recently told me that ""All [I] have to do is just get [her] really high"". *edit: to sort of take her mind off of the pain and discomfort. And to clarify, it's just weed.*

I don't like this. I take a very uh, girly approach to sex in that I sort of want my first time to be the cliché ""special"" and ""meaningful"". We've been together for almost two years, so for it to be with her also has a sort of special meaning to it.

**The issue:** we love getting high together, but I don't want it to demean our first... experience. *Also*, I don't want to feel like I'm taking advantage of her under the influence. She's definitely hornier when she's stoned (aren't we all?) and so doing it like this would just leave me feeling guilty and questioning whether sober her would have really been ready for it.

She would prefer to, overall, just get stoned and ""let it happen"" instead of planning it out ahead of time, which doesn't help the question of if she would go for it just because she's stoned and experiencing a lapse in judgment.

I understand there really isn't a ""right"" and ""wrong"" here, but what would you do in this situation? Is sex actually that uncomfortable for a girl? (She's always been absolutely terrified of things going into her.) Has she just heard that it's uncomfortable one too many times?

But basically I'm starting to feel really helpless in my relationship. When we argue he screams at me, and I'll cry and ask him to please calm down and just have a normal talk, but I feel like his rage takes over. He can't control his temper and nearly always ends up storming off and telling me to go fuck myself. Right now he's at the shop and I don't even know if he'll talk to me when he gets back but he was shouting and being so aggressive that I was too scared to ask him to stay anymore. 

We were fighting today and he said he didn't know if he wanted to be with me anymore (which he told me while we were at lunch with my family) I was upset and he was reasonable enough at the start but then when I tried to tell him that I was trying to make our (2 year) relationship work, he started screaming and refused to talk to me again and got really, really angry. Then when we got home, I was crying and he said he didn't care that he was making me cry and shouting at me loads, then when I asked him to calm down he shouted at me for interrupting me and kept going ""Just fucking let me talk!"" Over and over until I stopped talking. This is his way of controlling when I talk as even when he interrupted me multiple times and I brought his attention to it, he shouted for me to shut the fuck up and let him talk continuously until I stopped talking, even though it was him who interrupted me. 

He glares at me, and shouts and looks angry enough to hit me but I really don't think he would. I should mention that he broke up with me once when we were drunk because I thought he cheated on me and he was insulted. He asked me not to go to a party because 'I'd be looking for girls who he cheated with' so I didn't go, but he broke up with me anyway and I hit him. It was the wrong thing to do and I feel terrible about it and I know being drunk doesn't excuse me. Because of this I don't feel like I can say I feel like I'm in an emotionally abusive relationship, but I'm starting to wonder. He does scare me sometimes and his rage is uncontrollable leading him to be increasingly aggressive to me even whenever I agree with him and try and make things better.

If any of that were true, I would just deal with it. But it isn't true. I have been nothing but nice to all of them. I don't complain at all when my BF goes out to bars with them several times a week. I've opened my doors to them when they are too drunk to go home and have actually taken care of the one who said I was the biggest bitch while he (23M) had alcohol poisoning on my couch. If they said I tried too hard to be nice, I would understand that. But what did say makes no sense.

My BF told them they could all go to hell but now I feel hurt that they said those things about me and guilty for causing a rift between them and my boyfriend. The whole situation is really screwed up and I'm left feeling like I did something wrong, but I don't know what. Any thoughts?

EDIT:
1) Yes, my boyfriend told me. He was furious when he got back the other night from a trip to the bar where they all cornered him. I told him the next morning that he shouldn't have told me and he apologized.

2) Almost all his friends are single. The ones that are also in relationships weren't there that night.

3) I also agree that it is possible that he has changed his behavior since we started dating. He quit smoking because I asked him to. But he says that he still goes out with them as often as he used to, more if you count the nights a couple times a month that I join them.

4) It is possible that they are threatened because he is growing up. We moved in together last month. But only one of his friends said we were moving too fast and should reconsider. We've been together 8 months...

EDIT 2:
5) My boyfriend and I have an amazing relationship. I think in the course of our entire relationship we've had 5 fights. They are always about stupid little things and we resolve them quickly.

6) My boyfriend is not the kind to vent to his friends about me. He barely talks to anyone about his feelings, with the exception of two friends. Those two friends live in other states and both really like me.

7) The reasons the friends gave for my bitchiness: -When I go out with them I generally like to go home earlier than they do. I have to wake up 3 hours earlier than anyone else for work and my work is much more physical and I'm usually falling asleep at the bar before we do leave. -For one of their birthdays, I asked my BF to be DD. Every other time we've gone out for the past 8 months, I have been DD except that one time. -I once asked one of them not to swear (every other word was fuck) in front of my 6-year-old niece. -I have kicked people out of our apartment after they crashed for the night. When this has happened, it is usually in the afternoon when my boyfriend has already gone to work. -I prefer drinking wine over beer. I'm not kidding.

MY GF and I were friends for several years but have only dated for one. The past year's been great, but we've had our ups and downs, and now, as much as it sucks, I think I need to end it…

If you knew me and her, you’d probably think I’m crazy. She's beautiful, she's smart and she's funny. She's successful in her chosen profession. She cooks for me and cleans for me, and generally treats me far better than I deserve to be treated. No one's ever loved me this much, and I've never loved anyone else as much as her, but here we are…

In a nutshell. I love her, but I don't feel that I'm in love with her. There's reasons. Rationales. But that's what it boils down to. I can't stop missing being single. I find myself thinking about other girls. Girls I meet. Girls I know. I miss the chase, and yet I KNOW I probably can't do ANY better than her. I’ve truly outkicked my coverage… Nevertheless, I think about how fun it would be to go chasing tail with my friends almost constantly. I wish I didn't. I wish I was so head over heels for her that I didn't even NOTICE other girls any more. Does that actually happen to other guys? Or is the grass doomed to always be greener over there?

If you want the details, here they are: We're very different. I love to party. I love crowds. I hate planning ahead and tend to do everything by the seat of my pants. She on the other hand is a homebody. She's got our meals planned out a week in advance. My inability to stick to a schedule is a constant source of conflict.

It's hardest on the weekends. All I want to do is go out with ""our"" (aka ""my"") friends, but a lot of the time I feel like she just wants to be home the second we go out, and knowing that she wants to leave (the bar, the party, etc.) makes it hard for me to have fun. So we don't go. Or we leave early. And then I find myself resenting her cause I have to skip the fun...

Childish right? I'm 30 and still want to party non-stop. I feel like I need to grow up, but I can't help the way I feel. 

I said ""my"" friends earlier, because despite years of knowing me, she still sees herself as an outsider. She doesn't really like all my friends, and she tends to build these psychological walls between her and everyone else that makes it difficult for her to ever feel totally at ease with most of the people I choose to spend time with… Which means that more often than not, she’s there, hovering at my shoulder when I’m trying to mingle or joke with the guys. Is it too much to want a girl who can handle herself in a crowd? Who can kiss me on the cheek and disappear in the party for an hour or two, without me constantly worrying that she’s sitting in the corner, alone and hating every minute of it?

The problem is, a lot of these things that make me question whether or not I can see myself marrying her are totally out of her control. All my life, I've wanted to marry a girl with a great circle of friends and a huge, fun family. I myself have a HUGE circle of friends and my Catholic family is enormous and a huge part of my life. Likewise, I'd love to marry a girl with her own circle of friends, with a vibrant social life beyond me, and who could bring me into a whole new family of fun (and disfunction), of traditions and all that Norman-Rockwell crap. But she's none of those things... she has 3 maybe 4 close friends, and most of them are older and not really fun. She's estranged from her family, rarely speaking with them and spending her holidays with me (before we dated, she spent them alone).

So here we are. I've got a girl that can light up my life when we're alone, and her world revolves around me and mine, but I feel like she's a weight around my neck in most social situations. That's overly harsh, but directionally correct. Most people truly like her when they meet her, and she can be very charming, but I just wish she was more out-going, spontaneous and dare I say it, ""popular?""

I mean, saying that, I feel like the most juvenile high school douchebag alive. I'm 30! Love should be enough. Why do I find myself pulling away because she's not a party animal and doesn't bring a new circle of friends to the table? And yet that's just what I'm doing. 

Am I being immature? Part of me thinks this is just my fear of commitment (this is my longest relationship ever), but these thoughts aren't new. They've been bouncing through my head for months, but I'm just now giving them voice.

This has come to a head in the past week or so, because she asked how come I never talk about the future. She's told me that if I don't see us getting married, not necessarily in the next year or two, but EVER, then she doesn't see why we should stay together. In her defense, it's not an ultimatum and I think it's very fair. That's why I feel like I need to let her go. My life is very comfortable right now, and when she's in my arms, I'm truly content, but I feel like I OWE it to her to end it. To break her heart now if I feel that doing so is inevitable.

And the thought of doing that breaks mine.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest. I'd welcome your advice.

My girlfriend is mid 20's, myself early 20's, and I've never really been in a serious relationship.

Given that, what's the point of staying? I really enjoy her company and would love to continue the relationship, but not if that means I have to end up hurting her and occupying her valuable 20's. It's like a conflicting interest between my selfishness and being emotionally reckless. Is there a middle ground between long term and short term dating? What's even the point of having a girlfriend if you *believe* your long term goals don't include that person? 

This isn't to say that I'm not open to the possibility of something greater coming from this, but given my age, and inexperience - I think the odds are stacked.

So I didn't break up with him immediately. The day after I posted this he told me that he felt really depressed. He was in pretty bad shape so I was there for him. Once he felt better I tried to think things over and be sure that I wasn't exaggerating things. It took some time but I eventually ended up feeling the same way.

About a month later I just knew it was over. He'd done a few more things that irked me. He started making plans with her on days that we usually hang out. Once he even took her to the same restaurant he and I had been to the day before. Again, I realize that this may seem trivial and immature to some - I even see it that way sometimes. The major issue is that these things bother me and that's enough for it to be a problem. 

In the end, the differences in the way he and I would handle a situation like this were indicators of larger incompatibilities. We had a really good, clean break up and I feel great.

She called my phone a few hours later and left a message asking me to call if I had any questions about what we had discussed earlier.

I was thinking, I could call back and say, ""Sorry, I only got a little bit of your message. You seem to have been cut off."" When she tells me she was just calling to see if I had any questions, I could reply, ""Oh, that sucks. I thought you were going to say you thought I was cute and we should go for coffee.

Seems good because if she's down she can say, ""Oh, hey that sounds good!"" and if she's not she can play it off like a joke and so can I, so we both have outs.

&gt;For example, the advice givers are *very* quick to suggest ending the relationship instead of dealing with the issue at hand. I can't find the post\*\*, but for example, there was a guy who said his gf was jealous. He explained the situation clearly and included the fact the the girlfriend trusts him but the real problem was her fear of being alone (emotional issue at her end).

&gt;Since I am in a relationship with a similar problem, I knew that you can work through this and be very happy. I was surprised to be the only one not suggesting to end the relationship. 

&gt;\*\* Reddit needs to make comments (and what you liked) searchable by text and subreddit.

##[bensbitchxoxo](/user/bensbitchxoxo)  
&gt;&gt;For example, the advice givers are very quick to suggest ending the relationship instead of dealing with the issue at hand.

&gt;***YES YES YES.***

&gt;My female friend went to RA because her boyfriend was being a total dick. I know both of them. I'm friends with both of them, especially the guy. Everyone on RA-- and I really do mean *everyone*-- suggesting breaking up.

&gt;I told her not to listen to them. I told her that working out the problem is a lot more realistic. They were a great couple, other than the fact that the guy was going through a stressful period.

&gt;Well anyway it's been 2 or 3 months and their relationship, to my knowledge, has not had any real rough spots since then. Why? Because they fucking talked it out. Before that, for like six months, they were having a bunch of problems.

&gt;When people have no emotional attachment to the relationship, you simply can't make good decisions. I know people on RA might rationalize what they do as ""logical, as opposed to emotional."" But the thing is, when you're dealing with relationships, you have to consider emotions, and sometimes the emotional thing to do is the rational thing.

&gt;From 4 paragraphs summaries over the Internet, you can't possibly paint a portrait of a couple. You're dealing with real people here, sometimes people that have been together for years and have shared *many* memories. My two friends are a great couple for the most part, which is something people on RA just couldn't understand.

&gt;One other thing: I think there's a bias toward ""omg u should break up"" because the posts in RA, by their nature, tend to touch over the rough spots of relationships. Sure, I could write a few paragraphs about the bad parts of my friends' relationship, but I could also write a novel about the good parts.

---

##[blargtastic](/user/blargtastic)  
&gt;The reason that people on RA are quick to suggest a break up is twofold.

&gt;First, of the people who get ""break up"" as a suggestion for what to do, a great majority are leaning in that direction anyways, but are tiptoeing around it. Lots of posts go ""I'm dissatisfied with x, y and z, and thinking about breaking up, please help."" That person *wants to break up*, but is to passive to just go out and do it. It takes an outside observer to say, hey, you aren't satisfied with this relationship, and it'll be better worth your time to end the relationship now then to struggle hopelessly with it, when deep down you don't even believe that it's worth it.

&gt;Second - and this is where it gets a little more sketchy - is because RA is full of people who are single and want to live vicariously through other people. This doesn't have to be a bad thing. They could realize the warning signs from a past relationship and apply what they remember to what they see with the new one. Or they could just be bitter and want the poster to end it before the other party does.

&gt;Still, in 70-80% of cases, the reason a breakup is called for is more than just bitterness.

##[caindel](/user/caindel)  
&gt;I actually think that if someone goes to a forum saying ""I'm thinking about breaking up"" and is clearly distraught about it, it's *usually* more along the same line as ""I'm thinking of committing suicide"" - that is, they're thinking thoughts that they don't like and they're trying to have people talk them *out* of going through with it.  People always fall short when it comes to empathizing with those who are suffering from relationship issues, and it's not unique to the RA subreddit (which I haven't perused).  Have you ever once heard Dr. Drew (who is a complete moron, I should add) respond to a caller by saying that they should try to make it work?  Of course not.  The response is always ""the issues will not go away and you should break up and find a 'healthy' relationship.""  The things on Loveline may be veering towards the completely bizarre, but the point still stands.  The response never factors in the emotional trauma of breaking up nor does it ever suggest ways to work things out.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_b8zq9,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b8zq9/interesting_criticism_of_the_advice_given_in_ra/,moderator

On average, I am approachable and friendly but not the life of the party. I have done a lot of traveling and I am well off financially.

I think I am good looking and I try to dress somewhat fashionably when not running, at home or at the gym. My hair is thinning but I keep it short and it isn't very noticeable. I have never been on a date or even danced with a woman but I have been asked to dance or date when I was younger. I just turned them down because I used to be very shy. For the most part I grew out of that. That's about all I can think of that would be worth knowing.

She doesn't have many relatives other than her immediate family, and aunt &amp; uncle.  She has one sister (28/f) who still lives with her parents.  Her sister didn't graduate high school (but has her GED), and has never worked a day in her life.  Her family isn't well off, and often struggle financially due to job fluctuations and health issues.  Her parents are reaching retirement age, and their house is paid off, but I don't believe their plans ever involved continuing to support their 28 year old daughter who still lives at home.  Her sister seems to have no desire or will to do anything but stay at home all day.  She's not mentally or physically handicapped (other than health issues due to being overweight), but has never so much as looked for a job.  Her parents appear to have stopped trying to fight it years ago and have given up pushing her.

My wife and I live many miles away, so we don't have much contact (once yearly visits and monthly phone calls).  While we're not wealthy by any means, we live quite comfortably.  Ever since my wife told me about her sister, I've had a nagging feeling that when her parents are gone, we'll be ""stuck"" with her.  I've expressed to my wife my strong feelings that her sister will never live with us, and that I never want to support her, and she's agreed (although I don't think she will be willing to follow through when the time comes).  As more time passes, I think the window for ""getting a job"" and doing something with her life continues to shorten.  I think even retail and fast food places would be hard pressed to hire someone in their 30's who has never worked before.

They are coming for a visit this weekend, and I feel compelled to say or do something.  I don't know what her plans are when her parents pass, and I honestly don't think she has any.  Her aunt is already taking care of her other uncle who appears to be in a similar situation (fully grown adult, no job, health issues).  I have no intention of doing the same, especially for someone who won't eve
n try.

Should I casually ask what she's been up to lately?  Should I ask her if she's looked for a job?  What her plans are for the future?  Is there any way not to sound like an ass?

TL;DR: Wife's sister is 28, has never had a job, still lives with her parents.  I don't want to ever support her and would like to kick her ass into gear to help herself.  What do I do?

We've been arguing a lot recently, mostly about petty things. Both of us acknowledge that what we fight about is stupid. He's said before that he's afraid that if we break up, then it'll be because of one of these stupid fights. I can definitely see this happening.

Our most recent stupid argument was over whether I should have gone to his house to eat dinner with him and his parents. He still lives with his parents, and because we've only been together for a month, I feel weird about hanging about around his parents so often. It just feels so soon, I feel super awkward, and I've told him this. So I suggested that we just go out for dinner (which was the original plan, anyway), and he immediately became defensive. He told me that it's important to him that I get to know his parents, and that my feeling awkward around them should be something I suck up for his sake if I care about what's important to him.

I explained to him that I'd been hanging around at his house a lot lately, and that I didn't want to overstay my welcome. I've told him that he's more than welcome to come to mine.

He told me, ""I'm getting sick of this. You just can't understand logic. You say you want to be with me, you tell me you care for me, and yet you can't even have fucking dinner with me and my parents? It's always the same thing with you; you can't use logic. GIRLS can't use logic.""

I told him he was being immature and sexist with his silly blanket statement, but he was adamant that it's a ""universal truth,"" and that it ""wasn't an attack on me, but girls as a whole,"" as if this made anything else I had to say moot because of my innate inability to use logic. 

We've since moved on from this argument, but he hasn't apologised. I'm just afraid that these BS absolute statements about gender stereotypes are going to be an issue.

Because I know that bringing this back up would just lead to another fight, and because I don't even know whether it's worth bringing up anymore, we haven't discussed it since. Should I try to bring it up calmly with him? Or should I just wait until the next argument (which will be soon, inevitably)?

I'm not sure how long this has been my issue, but I'm willing to guess it's been most of my life. 

Despite my failings, I found a woman and we fell in love, lived together for a few years and then finally got married after we realized how well we meshed (she knew me well enough at that time to realize my failings in the conversation department, but it evidently wasn't a deal-breaker). Sadly, a short while after the wedding I had to move away for work; things were OK and we saw each other as often as our busy schedules would allow (usually at least once a month) until she was finally able to come join me where I'd been living. during the long breaks between seeing each other we'd text a lot and have phone conversations, but as I've said above I'm not the worlds best conversationalist, so we were never on the phone long. Despite this, our relationship remained pretty strong and fresh and we survived the better part of a year apart.

Now fast-forward a year and a half. My conversational skills have matured about none; we still talk and I feel like we're connected and things are going well until about 2 weeks ago.  

(a little more backstory, sorry) my wife has been training for some cycling races and I'm woefully out of biking shape (but in good shape otherwise!) and my work schedule doesn't give me enough time to do long rides, so she's been doing bike workouts with a male friend from work this summer. I'd thought nothing of it because I trusted her completely up until a couple of weeks ago.

The weekend workout rides had been going on for a couple of months and she had been going out with work friends once or twice a week - again, no skin off my teeth, I'd be able to join every once in a while, but usually was stuck working. Then, magically, I had a couple of days where I was free to hang out and go out to dinner/drinks etc! So the first night she went out and I wanted to join, but never got invited and stayed home drinking a couple beers by myself, finally going to bed at 11 since I had to be up early for work and she came in smelling of alcohol. I was annoyed at not having been invited to the fun and just kinda rolled over and went to sleep. a few nights later the same story was repeated, except this time it was after midnight when she got back.

I couldn't take it any more at this point and my suspicions got the better of me - when she was out of the room the next morning I stole a look at her phone and text message history with the guy she's been biking with. looking back though a couple of days worth of texts I see an obvious pattern of flirty texts from her with little snips of there conversations that night, things like: wife-""its prob for the best that you can exercise restraint"", him-""it takes quite a bit of effort, but like you said its for the best"", wife'""i feel like it should get easier to restrain as we know each other better, but instead its getting harder for me...""  And thus began my guilty/sneaky habit of looking through her texts with him when she left her phone out and left the room. 

In addition, however I made an effort to talk more, starting with my telling her that, though I didn't think of myself as this type of guy, I was getting really jealous of the guy she was biking with and all the time that she was spending with him where I wasn't invited - basically told her that I trusted her and knew that there wasn't anything going on between them, but that I would like to hang out too, especially when I'm free and getting ditched at home alone...it went over well, she agreed that she'd been ditching me too much and then told me that she enjoys spending time talking with him because he actually talks; they have a lot of similar interests, work on similar things etc. That stung and made me realize that this wasn't something that was happening to me, I was actively driving her away by not being who/what she needed. 

So, I've been making a solid effort to talk about everything thats going on in my life, asking lots about hers as well, basically trying to act like we were dating again and it felt like it was working - we seemed happier together, our somewhat stale sex life started to pick up again and I thought, just maybe I could be the guy she wanted. The feeling lasted for a few days until this week when she had to work late every night and was coming home grumpy and not wanting to talk much (hey, it does go both ways sometimes!). I was planning to go out and grab a beer or two with a few people from work last night and invited her to come along when she was done with work at 7:30 or 8...come 8:15 I still haven't heard from her, so I send her a text seeing if she has to stay late and if she still wants to meet up, no response. another 15 pass and I send another text, nothing. send another text at like 9 seeing if she wants to meet up at a pizza place for dinner and, not surprizingly, get no response. Decide that I'm getting jealous/untrusting again and that I'm going to just go head home and be alone for the night, when out of the blue another friend who didn't meet up for drinks texts and asks if we want to meet up for food at the same pizza place I'd been thinking of before. So, I figure its a sign and head out to meet up.

When I get to the restaurant I walk by the outside tables and who should I see sitting cozily across from each other at the end of dinner but my wife and the biking guy &gt;:( she tells me that she didn't want to interrupt my night out with my friends and was planning to go with a group of people but the others just weren't able to make it/cancelled etc. I shrug it off and head inside to grab some food with my other friend, my wife says she'll be in in a minute when she's paid her check. 
I get some food, she hangs out for 10 or 15 and then heads home with me close behind her. we basically got home at the same time and I was beside myself (internally) with fury and suspicion and decide that I want to see the phone and read the texts again (yes, I know I'm invading her privacy and I'm a horrible person, etc...but this just feels SO bad, the things I was thinking were driving me insane), but she doen't. let. go. of. the. phone. had it under her pillow all night even which is just totally weird for her - suspicion increases.

So, fast forward further to this morning; she's asleep, I finally access the phone and read: 
wife-""oh man that was interesting"" 
him-""haha, why?"", 
wife-""apparently I had like a thousand texts from {me} seeing if I wanted to go to {restaurant} with him and then he shows up and I'm there with you! sorry, I shouldn't involve you in my problems!"", 
him-""its OK, sorry if I make things worse"", 
wife-""no...Ive been pretty distant lately, but its a symptom you know? I'm not sure if it has to do with you or not...lets just say, I guess you're not the only one who has never felt completely satisfied in a relationship...?"", 
him-""well like you said the other night, maybe it's ok to be with someone that you're just happy with. Not necessarily someone perfect, which probably doesn't exist"",
wife-""yeah...""
him-""trust me, just like me you have to stop looking for perfection or you'll never ever be happy with your life. you'll end up living back in your parent's house like me...its sad. Its just like work - sometimes you have to stop and remind yourself why you went into this field or you lose sight. but if you can remember those reasons it makes it easier.""
wife-""well said :). I guess you are involved in my distraughtness cause I can't stop wondering what it would have been like if I met you a long time ago.""
him-""I know. but thats a lot of what ifs. and right now you have something that already passed all the what-ifs. most relationships don't get that far. I think you have something pretty special. and most people would be envious""
wife-""i don't know about that, but thats mature of you to say and I appreciate it. probably you and and I would have wound up being dissatisfied with each other anyway and then wouldn't be the good friends that we are now""
him-""you're probably right and I like that we are friends and don't want to do anything to jeopardize it.""
wife-""yeah, deal. :)""

So, I wind up going from intense hatred of this guy to grudging respect - I don't know how many truly good guys there are out there who would pass up on hooking up with a hot, dissatisfied married chick, but I have a feeling they're rather rare. If he hadn't been that type of guy, who knows what would have happened by now? And what happens when she meets the next guy who she wonders about?

So, nameless, faceless denizens of the internet - what do you think of my story? Should I just ask her if she wants out? should I reveal that I've read 2 months worth of text messages between them (really not keen on this idea, don't think it would go well for me...)? Do you think I can change enough to be the guy she wants? despite all of this, I still love her incredibly and would do anything for her (aside from letting her cheat on me - I won't take that, this ""emotional cheating"" has wrecked me far and away enough, add a physical relationship and I'll lose all composure and come unglued...). I really want to be a better communicator, I want our relationship to become better - better than it ever has been, really, but am I too late?

Thanks in advance.

We've been together 4 years tomorrow, living together for almost the same. This morning we had a discussion. Well, he did.. I just sort of sat there crying and feeling miserable for being such a poor partner. 

He says he doesn't want to be with me anymore because he gets no affection, no intimacy, no attention from me. He says he thinks it's because I don't love him, that I just think I do. Completely untrue, but I can't seem to convince him otherwise.

The 4 years we've been together I've only ever initiated sex once. We were both drunk, and too tired to make anything of it though. I rarely hug, kiss or show general displays of affection. Not because I don't love him.. I do. And it really pains me to know that he thinks I don't. We rarely have sex and when we do I'm constantly thinking in my head ""when will it be over? does it even have to start?"". I don't know why.. I do get very anxious. I've always been an anxious person.

We both know I need to see a professional. I have seen a psychologist before.. but my partner feels they're useless in my case.

Anyways.. after he left the house this morning I straight away called my local GP for an appointment. Luckily, I got one. I was frank with him and told him I wanted to see a psychiatrist because my lack of affection and intimacy, my anxiety, has damaged our relationship almost to the point of no return. He gave me a referral to see one and also prescribed me some anti-depressants to assist with my anxiety. I go back to see him in two weeks.

I'm on my way to figuring myself out, but in the meantime I need a little help working on my displays of affection. It should come natural. I should just be able to go up to him and say, ""I love you"" and give him a hug. But it doesn't seem to come that easy. I always keep thinking of the ""risks"" involved or possible outcomes. Eg, my affection is so rare that when I do show it I get, ""What do you want? You're never affectionate."" Embarrassing, kind of hurtful. So that itself makes me not want to be affectionate.. if that even makes sense.

I guess what I'd like is some suggestions on what little things I can do to show him that I do care. That I do love him. Day to day things that should come easy for someone that's in love.

We've been married 3 years, but dated for 8 years prior, and have a 1 year old baby.  She's always been a little uptight, but over the past 2 years this behavior has increased to the point that not a day goes by without an argument or tantrum developing based around issues of control &amp; trust, although she will never admit that is the case.  I've mentioned that this behavior bothers me but she almost always tells me that it's a result of what I do (or don't do) in our relationship.  If the issue isn't tied up in something I've done to draw out this behavior in her, then it's because she's feeling overwhelmed with work/our baby/family obligations/etc. and she'll have an emotional meltdown and will clam up and cry.  In my head I think it's unfair that she does this, but to tell her that (and I have told her that during the crying) always leads to a bad place and more fighting.  Basically I've never been able to calmly talk to her about the issues I have without her throwing an angry, emotional tantrum or finding a reason that she's validated in doing what she has done.

The complicated part of all of this is that she does do a lot.  She works a demanding job as a teacher, she cooks, does laundry, takes care of our finances, takes great care of our baby, etc.  I do a lot as well, but the difference is that she uses the things she does to validate her explosive behavior.  I'm not saying I don't get in irrational, bad moods because of the stresses in life, but if she calls me on it I don't try and bull through what she says and claim that it's OK.  I might not want to talk about it, but I at least process that I'm in the wrong and that I need time to cool off.  I feel like she still thinks she's validated in acting out after the dust settles.

I get a lot of, ""Well how do you expect me to act when I deal with shit-head students all day, then come home and cook dinner, do laundry..."" on and on.  I feel like it's unfair of me to say, ""I had a bad day with the project I was working on, and then I had to go pick up [our daughter] from daycare and rush back to get on a conference call...so what do you expect?""  But for her to say something similar is fine.


I don't think her perception is accurate or fair, but feel like I'm unable to communicate this because she almost always perceives what I say as an attack that she needs to defend herself from (as opposed to listening and trying to troubleshoot and work together based on the concern).  I admit I don't always phrase everything correctly, and have been having trouble staying calm lately as this becomes more of a common occurrence, but I have noticed myself walking on eggshells with almost all of our interactions lately.

I just tried to call her on this behavior about an hour ago and it ended with her storming out when I brought up why I was upset.  I assume we need counseling, but when it has been brought up in the past she is hesitant about going because she thinks she's going to get ganged up on.  I'm all for the idea because I've found she only acts out around me.  When we have disagreements and a third party is around, she at least will talk out the issue instead of just responding emotionally and blowing up.  Do you have any advice?  What is the best way to approach counseling?  Is there something I'm not seeing?  I'm purposely not including tons of examples that illustrate her behavior because this is already long, but I can explain more if I've left things out.  Thank you.

He doesn't seem to handle frustration well, and little things frustrate him easily.  When I do some little thing wrong, his natural reaction is to sigh and roll his eyes.  For example, if we're leaving the house and I realize on the way out the door that I forgot my phone and have to take 2 seconds to run back and get it, I get a sigh and an eye roll. Spill a glass of water?  That's a sigh and an eye roll.  

It's really beginning to get to me.  I feel like there's a subtext there along the lines of ""There she goes again.  What an idiot.""  On the plus side, he would never, ever call me that out loud.  But it certainly seems like that's what he's thinking.

Other than that, he treats me wonderfully.  But I'm worried that all his huffing and puffing may end up blowing our house down.  

I've mentioned that this bothers me and that I'd like him to be more patient with me, but I think this may just be in his nature.  I'm not sure whether he's capable of changing this, or whether he just doesn't want to.  

My question is:  Is this something I should push back on more assertively?  If so, what's a good response to a sigh and eye roll? 

Or should I just get used to it and accept it as part of his personality, and try to find ways for it not to get under my skin?

Often, my wife will do something that hurts me or upsets me and i found myself thinking, well if i were in her shoes i would have done things this way or that because its for the good of us, for the sake of making her happy, which in turn makes me happy.  I have come to realize that my priority list is her first, then myself, while hers is most often herself first, then me.  

I am not sure how to handle that because it makes me feel as though i love her much more than she loves me.  As an example, if my wife were to tell me ""i want you to watch this whole soap opera series with me because it would make me happy""  i would do it, no questions asked.  The reality is that i hate soap operas, with a passion, but i would enjoy watching it so much with her because i know it's making her happy.  I would quickly find pleasure in her enjoyment.  Her being happy would take priority over my distaste for the show.  

However, when it comes to the other way around, she will ""put up with"" things that make me happy for the sake of doing so, but it won't have the same effect on her, she won't find enjoyment in my pleasure.  So much so that her tolerance level for doing things she dislikes is very limited, and ultimately she reverts to not engaging in fun activities i enjoy because she does not enjoy them herself.  

This realization is really messing with my head, i am questioning the legitimacy of this relationship and it's honestly depressing me.  The more i think about it, the more i feel like i am not loved to the extent that i want to be loved, i am not loved to the extent that i love her.  Any thoughts?

I'm feeling less and less physically attracted to the whole idea of us together because all I think about is the other more attractive people I see him looking at.  He says he likes it for art as well.  I am concerned he has a problem.  And when giving him oral the other day, he mentioned something about his head filling with porn and images of me naked.  Which, I guess okay, I like that I'm thrown in there...

And its not like I don't have ABUNDANT pictures of me naked/erotic photos for him.  

I feel less emotionally close to.  I feel like I'm growing further and further away form him because half the time I'm around I feel like I'm with an addict.  And when he asked how we could compromise on the porn issue, he tired to explain why he looks...but there never really even got a compromise out of it, and everything is exactly the same.

How to I not be ""one of those bitch wives.""  I really, really don't want to be a prude and anti-porn...but I'm not sure how to get myself back to being over it (for awhile I was, and I even had sex with him/blew him quite a few times while he was looking at it...).  I'm not even sure why it suddenly bothers me so much.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_jhlc8,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jhlc8/im_slowly_getting_turned_off_physically_and/,

Been together about 6 years, married for just under 1 year.  She's 12 weeks pregnant with our first.

Our relationship is great, no complaints at all.  We're best friends, have similar interests, respect each other, etc.

The cause of a lot of our fights is her relationship with her mother.  I'm hoping to get a little insight from you guys about what, if anything, I should be doing.  Basically, at 31 years old, my wife and her sister are both still afraid of their mother.

My mother in law is (in my opinion) bipolar.  She goes through major shifts in personality.  She can be incredibly helpful and fun, and then the next minute she's very needy and dependent.  She uses my wife for most of her support.  

She calls her between 3-5 times every day.  I find this to be way, way too much.  My wife will ignore her calls during dinner, etc, but if she ignores too many or tells her mom that she needs to go, her mom gets offended and takes it out on my wife for a couple days.

None of this would bother me, except that it bothers my wife.  When her mom goes through one of her ""down"" periods, she calls my wife constantly, finding anything to get upset about and then hanging up on her.  Or just generally bitching about the same problem over and over.  Then my wife is in a bad mood, and bitches to me about all of this.

I try to encourage her to put a little distance between her and her mom.  To maybe set some limits on the number of calls, or at least set some boundaries for the relationship.  I know she tries, but her mom just gets angry and nothing ever comes of it.  We end up fighting almost every time.  She gets pissed off at me for telling her what to do, but really I believe pissed off that she's so helpless in the situation.

**tl;dr:** Wife's mother is very dependent on my wife, which puts some strain on our relationship.  Looking for any helpful advice from you guys.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,False,,,True,t3_imfy7,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/imfy7/wifes_relationship_with_her_mother_is_this_normal/,

Yesterday I wrote out this really long account of my relationship with this man (26M) with the intention of posting it here and asking for your advice. But when I read it back I realised all I needed to do was stop play pretending at a relationship he had already told me he was unable to commit to. 

For all the perceived complications, and 'special circumstances' I felt I had, those words just popped up in my head. **Do or don't, there is no try.** If he wanted to be with me, to commit to me he would. It's simple. Okay maybe the real world isn't Romantic Comedy simple, but the premise is the same nevertheless. 

So thanks RA, even though you didn't get to give me your input, writing to you helped clear my head and gave me the courage to go clear things out with him too.

It's also a LDR and we live about 100 miles apart and see each other as much as possible, generally every other weekend but it varies. 

When we're together, we have quite a lot of sex, several times a day. I admit his sex drive is much higher than mine but I always enjoy sex when we have it. 

However, I've never had an orgasm with him. I fake it sometimes because I don't want him to feel like he's not good at sex, because it really does feel good. I can just never quite cum. I can't when he fingers me or eats me out either.

He cums nearly every time we do anything sexual and it's hard not to feel resentment for that, as well as feeling very guilty that I'm lying to him about this. I know I should tell him but I really don't want to upset him. Honesty has always been really important to him and I can't even begin to figure out how I'd bring it up.

Our communication is generally really good. We talk on msn, in our tinychat room or in skype, we have a phone call every single night, and haven't missed one since last november. We can talk about anything, but I don't know what to do about this.

What do, reddit?

**EDIT: Thanks for all the good advice, guys. I ended up telling him about it soon after I made this post. You were right, I just needed to hear other people telling me to tell him. We're talking about it now. Much obliged to you all. It's a real load off my chest to be able to clear this, frankly. We normally talk about absolutely everything and I hated keeping a secret. To those saying it was a bad thing to do, I'm more than aware of that, which is why I really wanted to stop and start over. Again, thank you.**

I am 20F in college, and my boyfriend is the same age. We have been dating for about 4 months. Before dating and as I began dating my boyfriend, I was interested in this other guy, and the other guy and I became friends. The other guy has since graduated and moved out of the country. But, before the other guy left, we spent a lot of time together and we came really close to making out with each other, which I consider cheating. However, we both acknowledged that I was dating my boyfriend and nothing physical happened. During the almost-making-out-time I tried to rationalize what was happening but now I just feel bad. I think I wouldn't feel so bad if I was not emotionally attached to the other guy, but I was :/

1301359156.0,50,self.relationship_advice,gdjux,Girl with whom I'm best friends with is intentionally ignoring me after confessing.,ImBeingIgnoredAgain,59,9,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gdjux/girl_with_whom_im_best_friends_with_is/,"Ah, the marvels of relevant context. All that's needed is that we're one year apart and are of different cultural backgrounds. She's Indian, which interferes with any potential relationship because she may be married off.

So, we have a situation whereby I'm stuck feeling like crap because I can't reach her at all. Just last week we had met each other after a one week hiatus, which was when she admitted possibly falling for me. I've been in love with her for at least the last few months (to the point of detrimentally affecting my studies/willing to die for her if the situation called for it), so this was, to say the least, a welcome change of pace.

In the meantime, I flipped the relationship status away from single (to blank) to hint to a few other girls to leave me alone. This *worked,* quite effectively might I add. The problem arose when she saw it and assumed I was taking things too quickly, a point which I very much would like to contest. This is, however, irrelevant.

Between then and now, there's only been one moment of contact, and that was when she was hoping I could give her and some friends a ride to a club downtown where I live (which I was unable to accommodate as I had other plans). This was last Thursday. Since then, there's been absolutely no dialog despite her presence on facebook, etc.

and yes, I did try calling her, but only once per day. I called her yesterday but reached voicemail after two rings, meaning that she sent it to voicemail on her own. I'm not the type to inundate any one person with phone calls, so I'm leaving her alone on the assumption that something's going on in her life or that something happened which she wants to cope with on her own terms.

That said, *this is ripping me apart.* She's done this to our friendship before, and every time I've felt incredibly depressed because I've always only ever cared for this girl. I'm looking for a way to straighten out this one issue (we're honestly the best of friends when things like this don't come up). Not being friends with her is not an option in my mind, stubborn as it sounds.

**TL;DR:** best friend confessed, put me on ice soon after, and it hurts like hell. Should I get in touch? Should I wait? What do I do?

**Edit 1:** The four responses that are in so far suggest what I've thought, so I guess I'll roll with it. How do I remove my thoughts from idling on her all the time?

**Edit 2:** Against my better judgment, I tried reaching her again (only time today), this time via facebook. She confirmed that she put me on ice, so at this point, I've decided I'm going to stop taking the abuse. If she wants me back, she'll need to prove to me that she's worth my time, and I don't see any likelihood of this happening. 

I'm a human being, and I deserve to be treated like one. Just because I'm always there for her doesn't mean I'll let her treat me like shit. I'm not a dog.",,False,,t5_2r0cn,True,,,True,t3_gdjux,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gdjux/girl_with_whom_im_best_friends_with_is/,
1376527724.0,47,self.relationship_advice,1kdzd5,Should I (26F) be concerned about how he (27M) treated other women before me?,NevadaFlower,61,14,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kdzd5/should_i_26f_be_concerned_about_how_he_27m/,"We've been together for 8 months and he's been pretty honest about his dating life before he met me.  A couple stories stand out and make me seriously want to re-evaluate how I think about him: (1) he went out with a girl he met online, slept with her, then told her she was too overweight for him to date; (2) a FWB situation he had with a single mother who was clearly under the impression they were in a relationship, but he was ""just horny""; (3) a girl he purposefully got pregnant (not my messing with her birth control, just unprotected sex) when she had the impression he wanted to get married, only to tell her he had no intention of marrying her though he tried to talk her out of getting an abortion. (He even offered to pay her to have the kid; she ended up getting the abortion). 

This man was very up front about what he wanted early on in our relationship, including being married with kids within 5 years or so.  He treats me well, tells me I'm everything he has always been searching for and that I have everything he wants in a life partner.  He has spent a significant amount of time with my family, always posts pics of me online, frequently talks about our future together and has started to slowly move in with me.  Despite his obvious enthusiasm about me, I can't help but wonder if the way he treated those other girls is actually a red flag, or if this is normal behavior for a lot of men that they would never disclose to a significant other.  In terms of our relationship he has been very enthusiastic about the possibility of having children with me, though I made it absolutely clear that I would never even explore that possibility before marriage and would immediately have an abortion if impregnated.  He said that this was absolutely understood, and we have never had unprotected sex.  Even so, I have concerns about how he will treat me after the 'honeymoon' period of our relationship comes to an end.  I'm especially sickened by situation number (3), because that was an unbelievably cruel thing to do to someone.  

tl;dr: My bf was a total dick to other women but treats me like his queen.  Is this cause for concern?

EDIT: Clarification on point 3: he is pro-choice, but he wanted HIS child to be born and he offered to take full custody of the child, raise it as a single father. He wanted to pay her to carry his child to term, not to be a single mother. And for those asking why he wanted kids so bad: he's simply always wanted to be a father. It's what he wants more than anything else in life. When we had been together a few months we started getting into deep, detailed conversations about how we would like to raise our kids. After awhile, and given that previous incident with the other girl, I said I had zero intention of having kids before marriage and that I wanted to avoid talking about child-raising until a more appropriate time. He agreed and we've been more focused on the relationship itself ever since.
