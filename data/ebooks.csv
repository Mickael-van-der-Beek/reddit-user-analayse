We seemed to be garnering some attention from all over Reddit and beyond according to the current site traffic data.  I've gotten some great messages from readers, authors, and aspiring entrepreneurs looking to break into the realm of the Ebook Community.

I also want to thank all of those who have kept this place squeaky clean - relatively speaking, of course - by reporting spam or downvoting stuff to oblivion and beyond.  You guys and gals really save me time from having to slog through submissions.  Especially, a big thanks to those of you who contacted me when spam bots, spam accounts, and illegal resource submissions were present.  

When I jumped into Modding this subreddit I had to spend 3 hours going through the backlog of reported/spammed junk posts and comments.  It was tough but worth it.  

I still see new folks jumping in and promoting their stuff and I'm letting that happen despite the rules simply because of time and effort .  However, kudos to those authors who do contact me.  It makes my life easier and I can guide them through the process if they are new to Reddit submission standards and protocols.

Also, thank you to the folks who have written to me showing me support for this work.  I don't get paid since this is really a work of love.  So, thank you - you know who you are!

I also want to point out the new stuff on our sidebar! We got some new links and resources so check them out! And don't forget to contact me if you find any nifty links to resource sites or any relevant information you think would help our growing community. 

Have fun, stay safe, and always a read a good ebook before bed!

Just wanted to update you on some developments that have transpired here on /r/ebooks.  

* We've hit over 3,100 readers! Yay!
* We've added a new sister subreddit on our sidebar /r/KindleLend.  They are brand new and cater to the Kindle users who may want to share their books with their fellow redditors. 
* I'm thoroughly impressed by the evolution of articles and posts thus far since I joined up and am proud of you folks contributing.  Keep it up!
* Authors don't be shy to contact me or our Admin xamdam.  Mainly so we can get a dialogue going and so that we know if your post goes into the spam filter we'd be able to clean it out of there.

New e-readers are out and so are sites catered to ebooks.  Remember if you have any new links that you think your fellow readers would enjoy PM me!

Cheers,


Sir_Meowsalot

My friend and I have built a website called BookFreebies.com where we are hoping to build a community of eBook fans, specifically through social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Our goal is to link up with as many readers as possible.

We are hoping that, in time, our website can become a platform for authors to advertise their books completely for free. Being authors ourselves, we know how difficult it is to get our books out there in front of readers. Having as large a reader base as possible will help those authors to get their work out there to the people that love reading - that's you, hopefully.

I was wondering if others had this issue: calibre is working very well, but when I'm doing some tasks, for example sending books to my device or converting books, it freezes for many minutes. Seriously, I get up and go do other stuff in the meantime because it can get pretty frustrating... I'm talking about somewhere from 2-3 minutes for a simple book transfer, to like 10-15 minutes or more for more elaborate tasks (multiple transfers including 2-3 MOBI-ePub conversions)...

I'm running calibre on a MacBook that is a few years old, granted, but on which I still run Photoshop C5 without any major issues...

I'm really excited to celebrate the publishing of my first eBook on Amazon's Kindle Store. Feel free to skip all the text if you just want the download link.

I wrote and published the eBook, ""The 101 Dos and Dont's of a Successful Graphic Designer"" about 7 months ago on Design Panoply. I sent it around to get feedback from a lot of top design bloggers, and apart from some pricing and grammatical suggestions, it was all positive :)

I sold it as a PDF for a while, but just finally got around to reformatting it for Kindle supported devices.

Of course I'm selling it, but I wrote it in hopes that it would help other designers save some time and avoid the mistakes that I made, so I'm giving it away for free for a month. (The link will be inactive after Feb. 15, 2013)
You can learn a little more about why I wrote it here: http://www.designpanoply.com/blog/the-101-dos-and-donts-of-a-successful-graphic-designer

Of course, if you find it helpful, I wouldn't be against anyone buying it to show their support as well :)

If you enjoy it, I would GREATLY and unendingly appreciate it if you left positive feedback on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Donts-Successful-Graphic-Designer-ebook/dp/B00AX0QD7G/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357501581&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=john+shaver

You can download it for free in ZIP format here (includes both PDF and MOBI formats): http://s3.amazonaws.com/DesignPanoply/ebook-101-dos-and-donts-of-a-successful-graphic-designer.zip

Feel free to AMA about the contents or the publishing process as well :)


**EDIT:** Thanks so much for all the feedback and encouragement. I'm glad the book is so unanimously liked!

And special thanks to everyone who either bought it or left positive feedback on Amazon, you have no idea how much I appreciate it. If you are still reading it, please consider leaving positive feedback once you finish. It helps a ton.

I know only a few more people will probably stumbleupon it through Reddit, but there's a month left to grab it free, so enjoy :)",,False,,t5_2qqfh,1358358813.0,,,True,t3_165bum,http://www.reddit.com/r/ebooks/comments/165bum/free_ebook_the_101_dos_and_donts_of_a_successful/,

I am looking to upgrade from my current Kindle Keyboard. I've done some research and the Kobo Glo may appeal to me more than the Paperwhite. Although the Paperwhites feature were it estimates how much longer it will take to read the chapter would be good, since I have OCD and like to finish reading at the end of a chapter only. But the customization options are great in the Kobo, even comes with a font for dyslexic people which I'll be glad for. At the same time I hear Paperwhite has a nicer, more natural and even light. Night reading will be about 90% of my reading time. 

I already have 20 books on my Amazon library. Will I be able to get them on the Kobo Glo? Will it display right? I have Terry Pratchett books with footnotes. Will they work okay?

The series revolves around the adventures of Lew, a 12 year old, living in Mt. Lassen, California. Mt. Lassen is a small mountain town, everyone knows everyone, and Lew is known around town as the small, bookish kid in his class. While the town of Lassen itself is quite ordinary, the surrounding wilderness is not. Lew's Grampa, it turns out, has just discovered signs of the legendary Great American Ape, Sasquatch. Or so he thinks. Lew and Gramps embark one night to track the mythic beast, only to find huge swathes of the beautiful mountain wilderness deforested. Perhaps even more disastrous, and strange, than the clear-cutting, are the creatures which seems to ooze up from the wreckage. Ultimately, The Crystal Point of the MOG POGS is the story of a young boy coming to terms with himself, society, and nature, but with a cryptozoological twist.

While I know these kind of posts are typically loathed as the last ditch effort of a marketing team, I thought I would put it up anyway. Since my Dad retired from writing and producing Modern Marvels these books have been his creative outlet and every week he tells me how content he is with the small trickle of sales he sees. So while the second book has just been released, but is currently $2.99, the main reason I'm posting these links is because I'd love to get a call next week with my father raving on the other end about a huge spike in downloads.
If you still despise these kind of posts feel free to downvote, I'm just trying to make my old man's month.

From what I understand I don't need to worry about the library each book supports as there's programs to convert e-book files, correct? 

Anyway, I really don't know much about the Kobo but the Aura HD seems really nice. Specs are great however I'm not sure of the quality as I've never heard of Kobo. Is this a reputable enough brand? Maybe I'm just ignorant. It's also more expensive than the Kindle.

The Kindle is a little smaller and I kinda like that, but from what I've read there's more light bleed compared to the Kobo which is supposed to light up more evenly. I've also read they shove ads and promotions down your throat. Does the Kobo do this as well? Also how is battery life between the two?

Diaz Coleman's vision becomes yours in this exhilarating thriller as each page springs to life in an epic tale of action, comedy, drama, horror, and suspense. In the near future, a post-apocalyptic Earth sits stagnantly, as a remnant of humanity is at the opposite end of the galaxy. After arriving to our new home, we ﬁnd it is inhabited by children who possess unimaginable power. The parents of the children were casualties in a massive war several years prior to humanity's arrival. Leaders of Lasoon and Endocrum joined Nataar, a third kingdom, in a no-holds-barred struggle of sorcery versus technology. Driven by greed, the old witch queen of Lasoon sought to unravel the mysteries of Nataar's life force. Using her dark inﬂuences, Bruja's plan was achieved, and Nataar was near annihilation. However, the two kingdoms made a foolish mistake . . . allowing the children of Nataar to survive.""

I'm T.W. Grim; an independent horror writer and Redditor. Eight other authors of horror fiction and myself have come together to form a writing collective called, ""The Assembly."" This is our first collaborative effort - an anthology of horror microfiction stories, plus illustrations by an artist by the name of Slade Adams.

The book is a collection of our own favorite posts to /r/shortscarystories, which is a subreddit where users post scary stories that are no more than 3 paragraphs or so in length. We hope that you give it a shot (hey, it's free, why not?).

This FREE promotion starts TONIGHT at 12 AM, **Pacific Standard Time** ... so, 4 AM on the East Coast (to clear up any potential confusion). It ends on Tuesday night at 11:59 PM, PST.

[You can check out Anecdotes in Ashes here at this link](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E9J3DWU). We hope you take a peek at it - thanks for your time!

It's a Nokia 3110c that has a 2 gig memory card. I installed MTextReader ver. 2.1. [just drag and drop into the memory card]

It can only read text files (.txt), so what I did was unpack the epub book. The files will open in firefox/chrome. I then copy-pasted the separate text files into one txt file. 

You have to make sure that the txt file will not exceed 320 or so kb, since the MTextReader software cannot process more. If it goes past that size, separate the file into chunks then rename accordingly. 

Place the file/s into the memory card. [create a folder or something]

Then go to Menu&gt;Gallery&gt;*name of your mem card*&gt;MTextReader&gt;Browser&gt;/E:

This text dialog will appear: ""Allow application to read data in: Memory card""

Click 'Yes'

Then just search for the txt file you want to read.

When you are done reading for that time, be sure to go to 'Menu&gt;Close Book' since this will save your place in the book. To open to the place where you last stopped reading, just go to MTextReader&gt;History. 

That's it!

* Make books embeddable to share easily, so readers can start reading from the review site then read it somewhere later on.
* Add some forums within the ebooks, so readers could hang out.

I've asked a similar (but, I think, poorly phrased) question on the Mobileread forums, as well as the Amazon KDP forums.

I have a fixed layout book that looks great on the Kindle Fire, and just fine on the older Kindles… but it will not work on both. I'm hoping someone here can give some friendly advice.

To create a book that degrades gracefully, I used media queries in the css (lots of display:none !important and other nonsense going on)… but it works, and degrades nicely from the Kindle Fire to the older MOBI format.

However, these four lines of code in the OPF are breaking the Legacy Kindle book (it will not load on a Legacy Kindle Device in Amazon Previewer at all, but works lovely on the Fire in Amazon Previewer). And, when these lines are removed, the fire version is (obviously) ruined — but the Legacy Kindle version looks great: 
____

`meta name=""fixed-layout"" content=""true""/`

`meta name=""original-resolution"" content=""600x1024""/`           

`meta name=""orientation-lock"" content=""portrait""/`

`meta name=""RegionMagnification"" content=""true""/`
____

Is there a way to flag these lines of code in the OPF file as *KF8 only*? 

Barring that (because I do not think there is a way to do this), is there a way to package TWO versions of the ebook (or even two versions of the OPF file) for Amazon? 

The book was hand-coded as an EPUB file, and run through Kindlegen via Amazon Previewer. 

**EPUB Conversion results *no errors* and *no warnings* in Kindlegen.**

The book is currently on the store [here.](http://www.amazon.com/The-Bently-Reserve-ebook/dp/B007PVTVTS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333127020&amp;sr=8-1). As you can see, Amazon does not recognize it as compatible with regular Kindle devices. I have experimented with Kindle Previewer and my own Legacy Kindle, and with the removal of those four lines of code the book works fine. 

Barring these solutions, I considered using (even more) media queries to set the `body` size for the Kf8 via a CSS media query, but this isn't producing good results (margins are still appearing around the body content).

Any advice would be appreciated. 

Amazon strongly recommends that we do not publish different device-oriented of the same book, and so there *has* to be something I'm missing here, because otherwise this book degrades nicely on a Legacy Kindle. 

It would make little sense if there wasn't a way for a fixed layout book to gracefully degrade to other devices… because after all, publishing multiple versions of the same book a book is so frowned upon by Amazon.

Thank you! (Also, if you know a better subreddit that is more ebook coding oriented, let me know).

A few days ago I posted in r/writing about a new publishing effort that a few of us were working on. There was a lot of interest and we spent days without sleep or work to put together something which, we feel, is pretty unique. Awesome redditors like karlgrave, druidcitychef, and throwaway_writer have contributed tremendously and plan to contribute on an ongoing basis to create a community of awesome.
We want you to join the Pack Right Now. We're open for enrollments for the weekend.
From my previous post:
Here's the ideals guiding our group:
We believe that we're stronger together.

We will help each other achieve our goals.

We believe that when one person succeeds the whole group is helped.

We believe reddit writers deserve to make enough through self-publishing to afford a car wash now and then.
Based on these ideals we're going to try and begin a sort of ""imprint"" for self published, reddit member authored books. The idea is that anybody looking for help self publishing can get help from members of the group, recieve an imprint related to their genre, and benefit from increased downloads by members of the group.
If willing to participate, writers can have a little blurb about their book placed in the book of another reddit writer in the same imprint. All they have to do is let another reddit writer have a little blurb in the back of theirs.
The benefit there is that, obviously, there's more connections to your own work as you connect to other's. With the entire group downloading your published work, you expect higher rankings to kick-start your sales. With new books getting higher rankings (and which include a blurb about your own book) you also expect your own sales to increase.
Make sense?
We haven't worked it all out yet, not by a long shot, so the sub is private for now - BUT - we want help.

I currently have seven short stories available on Amazon for .99 each (one of them, Glitch, actually still on its last promotional day, ending at midnight 6/5).  If you have Amazon Prime, all the stories are free to borrow.

Stories marked 'romance' might better be classified as love stories.  They're not traditional romance in the sense that there's no sex.  Additionally, just as a forewarning, these are intended for adult audiences.  There's nothing sexually gratuitous, but language and subject matter for most of these isn't really appropriate for children.
 
[This is my author profile](http://www.amazon.com/N.-M.-Lombardi/e/B00BPYAX8Y), which lists all the titles, but the individual stories are as follows:

*General Fiction / Romance*
A wounded soldier, now in a battle with his own internal demons as he
attempts to recover from his emotional and physical scars, finds some
semblance of solace through his hospital's therapy dog program. Will
an enigmatic woman who volunteers for the therapy service be the key
to helping him find peace, or will she instead just drive him to build
a bigger wall around himself?

But when Tammy begins to withdraw from him, he must face the possibility that she has scars of her own she's been learning to live with.

*Fantasy / Fairy Tale / Romance*
When a childless couple seeks the assistance of a witch to grant them their greatest wish, she transforms a barn kitten into a human child.

*Paradise Squandered*, the ambitious debut novel of writer Alex Stefansson, is a raw, powerful portrait of a disaffected generation in an empty, consumer-culture world.

This is a story of what it is like to aimlessly trudge along that strange and uncharted course that is life after high school. Andrew Banks returns home from a long-promised graduation trip to Hawaii and re-enters a bland, suburban landscape of privilege and indifference.

Talented but uninspired, Andrew knows he wants to pursue his art, but he has no idea how. He resigns himself to going through the motions of his own life, until the night he overhears the disturbing truth of his father's death. He instantly decides he has to leave his childhood home forever, and a darkly hilarious odyssey ensues.

**Extinction Point (313 reviews, 4.3 average)** 

Reporter Emily Baxter has a great job, an apartment in Manhattan, and a boyfriend she loves. All that changes the day the red rain falls from a cloudless sky. Just hours after the first reports from Europe, humanity is on the brink of extinction, wiped from the face of the earth in a few bloody moments, leaving Emily alone in an empty city. As she struggles to grasp the reality of her situation, Emily becomes the final witness to the end of our world... and the birth of a terrifying new one. 

The world she knew and loved is dead and gone. Now Emily must try to find a way out of New York as the truth behind the red rain is revealed: the earth no longer belongs to humanity.

**Toward Yesterday (68 reviews, 4.1 average)**

What would you do if you suddenly found yourself twenty-five years in the past? For the nine-billion people of the year 2042 it's no longer a question ... it is a reality

When a seemingly simple experiment goes disastrously wrong, James Baston finds himself stranded alongside the rest of mankind, twenty-five years in the past. A past where the old are once more young, the dead live and the world has been thrust into chaos.

Contacted by the scientist responsible for the disaster, James is recruited to help avert an even greater catastrophe. Along with a team of scientists, a reincarnated murder victim and a frustrated genius trapped in her six-year old body, James must stop the certain extinction of humanity. But if the deluded leader of the Church of Second Redemption has his way, humanity will disappear into potentiality, and he is willing to do anything to ensure that happens. 

A serial killer, a murder victim, a dead priest, and James' lives are all inextricably bound together as they plummet towards an explosive final confrontation, the winner of which will decide the fate of humanity.

Greetings Redditors! My friend Devlik thought you might be interested in my novel, *Scent and Shadow*. If you miss novels where the vampires are people-eating monsters, and you like snark, power games, ambiguous morality, and explicit sex, this book may be for you! If you are easily squicked and don’t want to read material some may find objectionable, you might want to skip this one.

 

**From now until August 1st Redditors can get a FREE copy of the ebook at [Smashwords](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/97110) using the coupon code SC33T at checkout.** *Scent and Shadow* is available in PDF, mobi, epub, LRF, and PDB, and the great thing about Smashwords is once you’ve “bought” the book, you can download it in as many formats as you like!

 

If you like *Scent and Shadow*, I’d really appreciate if you’d leave a review or rating at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Scent-Shadow-Aether-Vitalis-novel/dp/0615583237) or wherever you buy ebooks.

 

I’ve been published in a number of print anthologies, including *Hungry For Your Love: an Anthology of Zombie Romance* (St. Martin’s Griffin, 2010). I’m a history geek, a gamer geek, and almost accidently minored in Folklore. You can find out more about me and my writing at [mercyloomis.blogspot.com](http://mercyloomis.blogspot.com) and [www.mercyloomis.com](http://www.mercyloomis.com).

 

Here’s a little more about the novel:

 

Madison, WI. 1999. When vampire Gabriel Chapel decides to take on a fledgling, he knows not just anyone will do. Newly-turned vampires kill at least one person a night for the first decade or so—a fate most humans could never adjust to.

For college student Amanda Bairns, nothing is more important than finally taking control of her life. But when Gabriel forces her to drink his blood, Amanda is pulled deeper and deeper into a supernatural underworld she never knew existed, where mages have their fingers in local government, shapeshifting faeries control infrastructure, and aether-rich ley lines attract a host of creatures welcome and unwelcome.

With the vampire’s blood coaxing her to become a murderer, Amanda has four weeks to discover which means more: her freedom and humanity, or the power Gabriel offers. But neither Gabriel nor Amanda realize Amanda is a pawn in a much bigger contest—one which could have lethal consequences not only for the two of them, but for the entire city. *Contains violence, explicit sex*.",,False,,t5_2qqfh,False,,,True,t3_u3rzv,http://www.reddit.com/r/ebooks/comments/u3rzv/scent_and_shadow_by_mercy_loomis_author_promotion/,

First, allow me to introduce myself:

I am Sir_Meowsalot a new Mod to help xamdam with this fine sub-reddit.  I'm also a Mod for [r/ImaginaryTechnology](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryTechnology/) and an approved submitter for both [r/ImaginaryMonsters](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryMonsters) and [r/ImaginaryLandscapes](http://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryLandscapes/).  So, give them a gander if that type of stuff is to your liking.

-----------

**Now on to the important stuff**:  

I'm sure some of you have by now realized that some things have been added to the sidebar of the subreddit.  **-----------------&gt;** (Look that way!)

Ebook sources, rules, etiquette, and general stuff that needed to be addressed to keep the submissions and discussions in line and in tip-top shape have been added.  Please, take a moment and familiarize yourselves with them.   

Xamdam and I have discussed that to keep the submissions nice and tidy those promoting their books will have to contact us.  This is to make sure that the feed doesn't get spammed with blogs and random miscellaneous promotional drives.  

To date these blog and misc. spam haven't been very successful, nor well received, due to the due diligence of xamdam, *you* the subscribers, and the spam filter.  So, from now on all authors, writers, or publishers will have to be approved by either xamdam or myself before they will be allowed to promote their stuff here.  This will stop legitimate authors from having their submissions lost to the spam filter.

-------------------

So, as a good litmus test of this **[Author Promotion]** system:

Recently, the sub-reddit had been given the chance to host an [Author Promotion](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebooks/comments/qouof/in_celebration_of_read_an_ebook_week_jd/), which is the first of - hopefully - many such promotions on r/ebooks.

If there are any questions, issues, or even random stuff that you wish to be addressed don't hesitate to contact xamdam or myself.  

Cheers and salutations,

I noticed that personally, now that I can pretty much obtain any text I want (usually without paying money, thanks to calibre and torrent websites) my concept of ""value"" is how well formatted the e-book is, a working table of contents, and a heavily footnoted / lexicon available within the text.  

Getting back to my original example of Hamlet, I would pay $$$ for a suitable e-book that fulfills my pre-stated conditions.  Anything less and I would look to pirate the book first.

I don't have to worry about compatibility of my existing library because all my books are either the free classics which I can get again and the paid for books I've already read and unlikely to read them again.


I can see positives and negatives to each one in terms of functionality, the price is almost identical so was I wondering if the kobo broke as easily as the kindle as a deciding factor.

No need for a reply on this, but I've been a loyal B&amp;N customer for quite some time now and I just wanted to let you know that the popular technology news site Techdirt is besmirching your good name as a company in this [article](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121126/18084721154/barnes-noble-decides-that-purchased-ebooks-are-only-yours-until-your-credit-card-expires.shtml). Now, obviously no corporation trying to do business in the digital marketplace would have such a tremendously shortsighted policy on copyright and DRM. 

I simply refuse to believe that Barnes and Nobles would treat their customers like petty thieves AFTER they have bought and paid for the digital products you're selling; and it is nothing but laughable to think that my ebooks would become inaccessible should my credit card not be up to date. Imagine the stupidity it would take to actually do that to your own customers! It's like something the barbarians at the RIAA came up with thinking it would hamper piracy! Hilarious, isn't it?

Now, I strongly suggest you have the fools at Techdirt correct this vicious slander.

P.S. On the off chance these horrifying accusations are be true, I will take the precaution of no longer be buying any ebooks from the Barnes and Nobles Nook store and I will indeed look into stripping the DRM from my existing purchases (it's apparently quite easy). I will instead be buying from companies trying to do business in the 21st century and/or finding other (wink wink) DRM-less sources for my reading material until I get some kind of confirmation that these accusations are baseless and wrong.

Over lunch and a bottle of wine almost 2 years ago we came up with the idea to leave everything behind and start traveling. Our jobs give us that freedom as long as we have a internet connection to work from anywhere in the world.

So we came up with our site [For 91 Days](http://for91days.com)  - staying 3 month at a time in one spot. Which gives us enough time to really get to know a place and still have time to work on our ""day jobs"". 

So far we have been to Oviedo,Spain - Savannah, GA - Buenos Aires - Bolivia - Palermo, Sicily - Sri Lanka and are currently in Busan.

The sites itself only make a small amount of income so traveling like this is just our expensive hobby but thanks to eReaders, especially the Kindle we opened up an other income stream.

We turned each location into eBooks. Everything you can read in the books you can read online. So we thought we are not even going to sell one book. Proven wrong! 

For some reason people like to read content without being connected to internet or by sitting in front of their computers. Who would have ever guessed! We are able to sell 1 - 2 ebooks a day. Which is not a lot but it does help!

Here is a link of all published books so far: [For 91 Days Travel Books](http://www.for91days.com/for-91-days-e-books/)

We offer them for free once in a while. I will announce free promotion days as comment here.

And if you have questions about us, our project and the books do leave a comment!

Having been a member of this sub-reddit for a while I find that something needs to be added to our little gathering spot.  I wish to propose the gathering of links to websites that offer E-books either for purchase or for free.  

These would be sites that allow authors from all over the Internet to ply their written goods with their consent (very important as I'm sure some of us believe that should foster in these authors the belief that their hard work should be rewarded and given credit).  A good example of such a site for instance would be our tried and trusted **Amazon** which offers such a service.

If we could put such sites and their appropriate links to the right side of this sub-reddit we'd be able to help folks new and old to the E-Book realm to find their reading material - and also stop those new and old here from asking where they can get materials for their brand new E-book reader.  

As you post a comment please take into consideration ladies and gentlemen to not repeat links that other posters put up (i.e. Amazon).  As well, please take the time to supply a link as well.  

Allow me to start by offering three place from which I gather my E-Books from:  

* [Kobo Books](http://www.kobobooks.com/)
* [Feed Books](http://www.feedbooks.com/)
* [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/)

Edit: As more links are posted by you folks I shall add them up here in a list for all to see what has been suggested negating any repeats:

* [Smashwords](http://www.smashwords.com/) 
* [Many Books](http://www.manybooks.net/)
* [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page)
* [Open Library](http://openlibrary.org/)
* [Book Yards](http://www.bookyards.com/)
* [eReader IQ](http://www.ereaderiq.com/)
* [Baen](http://www.baen.com/) 
* [Calibre E-Book Reader Software](http://calibre-ebook.com/) (has a search function for E-Books)

After seeing how much some people struggle to create well-formatted books for the Kindle, I started working on this service, and I thought I'd post it for reddit's consideration as well, although you guys probably aren't quite so much the target market.  If you know what XML is and how to work with it, you can probably do what my site does.  But a lot of people don't, and just want to concentrate on writing, and I think my site makes it easier for them at prices cheaper than most conversion services (it does word conversions as well, by the way).

The trial version is free, so you can play with it without paying.

So [get your copy of *The Lightcap* today](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D0ECD5S) on me (well, technically on Amazon... but you get the idea.)

* * * * * 

Synopsis:

*Adaptech made its fortune with the Mind Drive, a product enabling control of electronic devices through thought. Most citizens in the Region adopted Mind Drive technology quickly, welcoming it as a more efficient way to interact with everything from computers to coffee machines. Now Adaptech wants to use its own employees to beta test a new product, an extension of Mind Drive tech known as the Lightcap.*

*After Adam Redmon is promoted to lead the group of programmers tasked with testing this new device, his strange dreams begin to blur into reality. When a member of his team abruptly disappears, Adam uncovers evidence showing his employers didn’t fully disclose the Lightcap’s functions and side effects. What he learns puts him directly in the crosshairs of the most powerful people in the Region, people who will stop at nothing to keep their secret safe.*

And here's why you should buy it: Too many new writers--especially young writers--nowadays are merely writing ""fan fiction"" with different character names and slightly different plot points from whatever initially inspired them to write in the first place, whether a video game or a movie; I'm trying to break the cycle with my own stories. I don't describe the character's physical appearance in the first paragraph of my story (like so many beginning writers do--and by no means am I a beginning writer, nor is ""Lucifer's Tongue"" my first story); I don't jump into exposition the first chance I get, nor do I force ""exciting"" moments too early on in my story just for the heck of it. If you read my story, you'll see that I've carefully crafted a slow-burning horror story.

""Lucifer's Tongue"" is reminiscent of ""Tales from the Crypt,"" some of Stephen King's earlier short stories (such as the ones found in ""Night Shift""), as well as Clive Barker's (""Books of Blood""). This isn't for the fainthearted; it's not a pleasant story.

Like Hugh Howey (""Wool""), I would love to inject life into self-publishing but I need your help! I don't want your money (it's either $0.99 or free--depending on when you read this); but if you could write me up a review, that would be great!

Thanks a lot,

I have never used an eBook reader before; I've only read books printed on paper. So I have no experience of reading books on a eBook reader device.

I'd like to know peoples' opinions about the best eBook Reader software for the iPad. The only specific requirement is that it should be able to read ePub format, but among the things I would like are:

1. Able to take advantage of the iPad 3's high resolution screen to deliver the best possible and cleanest text.

2. Features like bookmarking, highlighting, adding notes, if possible.

3. Built-in dictionary.

4. Ability to group books by author or type for easier searching.

5. Multiple backgrounds (like sepia) so I can find one which is most comfortable to my eyes.

Additionally, it would be nice to be able to read other formats, such as mobi, lit and pdf. Another plus would be a large number of included fonts (but good fonts with lots of hinting information to produce text that looks good on the high res screen).

I understand the iPad comes with iBooks preinstalled, and I plan to download the Kindle app right away. I was wondering if there are better reader apps than those two, with more of the features I listed above. I heard Stanza was good, but it's no longer under development.

Again, this question is mainly about ePub. I understand that DRM'd books might only open properly in their appropriate reader, but my question is more about books like the huge library of classics at Project Gutenberg.

It's crazy that they're all already available in ebook format for sale out there, but I can't buy them. It leaves no available options that I can see that would support the authors.

My name is David Sterry and I wanted to let r/ebooks know about a site I created to help people sell Ebooks. It's called CoinDL and there you can sell Ebooks for a new Internet currency called Bitcoin. 

I realize this is the first you're hearing of my site and to most of you Bitcoin is new as well. Bitcoin, being as complicated as it is amazing, always brings up plenty of discussion and I am happy to answer any and all questions about it or CoinDL.

When you get some sales, your bitcoins (the site keeps 20%) will be sent to you in 48-72 hours at which time you can lock them away under your mattress, buy goods and services online, use them to settle drink tabs between friends or exchange them for your national currency of choice.

I started CoinDL because I am extremely fascinated by Bitcoin and wanted to see a complete economy grow around it. Since it's perfect for online transactions (being a form of digital cash) I thought, ""What's a better fit for Bitcoin than a downloads marketplace?""

Summary: Simon Stewart is a factory sorcerer employed to extract ore from rock using magic. He survives a terrorist attack in which everything familiar is deconstructed: His workplace is destroyed, his friendships called into question, and the way he casts spells tarnishes his credibility with the local royalty. By assisting the undead prevent a second attack, he becomes embroiled in the politics of war. For Simon, the war begins with a harlot bound to a piece of eight.

Brought together by a series of unfortunate events, a crippled naval captain, a tortured warrior,an Ex-Marine, and an engineering genius find themselves thrown together down a path from which there is no escape. Pressed into service or sworn to defend their planet, they are under orders from the United Nations Federation to traverse known space aboard the UNFS Manifest Destiny and face off with a sentient species of superior design. When the battle cannot be won and all that remains is annihilation, the crew must challenge their understanding of both time and space in order to escape. Out of power and crippled from their ordeal, they find themselves crash landed on a planet so vastly different yet similar to the home they left behind. With the enemy closing in from space and new battles to fight on the ground, the survivors must overcome their differences if they intend to beat the odds and make it out alive.

I normally buy from Kobo but I had a gift card and wanted to use it up on for the iBook store.

Now I feel kind of screwed but I'm looking for ways to break the DRM so I can use my legitimately purchased content the way I intend to. So far I found a way to unzip the epub file but I don't know what stuff to delete before I zip it back up again to remove the DRM. Does anybody have any advice? I read a post from this subreddit dated about 3 months ago that got me this far. I was hoping somebody could get me the rest of the way. Or maybe there is a way the DRM issue.

I'll be doing an AMAA/book discussion in /r/books on Thursday, February 7th at 11 AM for people who want to discuss what they read.

[Here's the link to the book.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007TPZ7XO/)

It's a first-hand account of my experience teaching at a high school in the rural southern US, presented as a series of vignettes.

It's got 5 star/29 ratings on Amazon and 4 stars/40 ratings on Goodreads.

I wrote the book as a result of Reddit's encouragement.

Some of my posts that led to the writing of the book:


[On whether teachers become attracted to students.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k858y/teachers_of_reddit_have_you_ever_fallen_in_love/c2i8xq4)

[On teaching evolution in a rural southern high school.](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/q0ee4/i_aint_even_mad/c3try9d)

[On a student who threatened to accuse me of sexual harassment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62u4)

[On a time where I tried to hold a lazy kid accountable and failed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q62v2)

[The story that led me to quit teaching](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkucu/ok_teachers_what_is_the_worst_experience_you_have/c3q6ags)

People read these posts and encouraged me to write the book.  So I did.  Now it's free if you want to read it.

If you're reading these words, you can read the book.  [Here are all of the free Kindle apps you can use.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&amp;docId=1000493771)

If you download the book and read it, consider leaving a review of the book on the Amazon product page or over at Goodreads, so other people will know whether it's worth the investment.

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know, and thanks for reading!

Well, I'm thinking in purchasing a couple of ebook readers (for me and my gf), and I am considering these two (I don't need a fancy expensive color screen). Since they almost dance within the same price margin, which one would you recommend?
I've seen the kindle 3 in action, and it looks gorgeous in black, and operates rather well to read formatted books for Kindle. Doesn't behave that well on pdf or other formats.    
The nook on the other hand can be unlocked to install apps from the android market, right? That would mean I can read basically ANY format I want just by installing the proper app....right? Right?    
A second doubt is, how well do these two perform in Chinese (a feature my gf would use a lot, simplified mainly, but also traditional).

Heavily skewed toward the younger demographics, though a decent distribution nonetheless. Those numbers are great and all, but there were some great comments from users in both the survey and in the original post.

[r/ebooks post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebooks/comments/rg61m/hey_rebooks_im_looking_to_start_a_business_around/)

And here are the main topics discussed in the comments:

* There seems to be a lot of hate toward DRM and any sort of rights management
* International availability seems to be another hot topic
* Indie authors being available on *only* Kindle is an annoyance for non-Kindlers
* Many people wish e-books were cheaper, many reasoning that digital distribution costs close to nothing after initial production costs
* Time-based valuation of books was a great idea brought up by several people, higher prices with the release of hardcover, and much lower prices by the time mass market paperback comes out
* E-books costing more than paperbacks gets a lot of hate, as does the high prices of older e-books
* Internationalization of books is a market that is yet to be tapped (I think)
* Well formatted e-books are better for consumption, and is sought after

There was also a fantastic (albeit lengthy) comment on the dangers of lowering the price of e-books, in the sense that they will harm the publishing industry as a whole. Here it is, in all its glory:

&gt; E-book pricing is a really complicated issue right now. Amazon pricing e-books at $9.99 out of the gate put us in danger of lowering the public's expectations for what a book is worth, and most people don't realize that places like Amazon, Wal-Mart and Costco actually sell books at a profit loss because they make up such a small part of their business. Consumers see $9.99 for an e-book, and then think $30 for a hardcover book is outrageous. But (at least in Canada), book retailers strong-arm publishers for deep discounts (usually 50-60% off the cover price) and even then do not pay for stock until a customer has made a purchase. So consider that a hardcover book straight from a publisher costs a retailer $15, and they profit the rest of the cover price - not the publishers.

&gt; On the publisher's side of things, all the jobs and expenses going in to making a print book have a digital equivalent. Just because they aren't producing a physical product doesn't mean it costs drastically less to produce. I'm not sure what kind of impact e-retail has on e-book pricing, but honestly, $15-$17 for an e-book is an incredibly fair deal. Especially if e-booksellers begin windowing, which is the process of dropping the price over time, or with different formats (ie, a hardcover comes out for $30, after some months of sales they release a trade paperback for $20, if it does well then a mass market edition for $10). This could be done with e-books: offering an enhanced version for slightly more money, a regular version for an average price, and then dropping the price after a number of months.

&gt; My concern is that people shouting about high e-book prices could damage the publishing industry. I think it is important to communicate to consumers what an appropriate price for a product is, and I'm afraid things like Amazon's $9.99 books will adjust the public's perception of what both print and e-books are worth. There is more going on here than just price wars, and I think it is important to protect/support the publishing industry. If they need $15 for an e-book to pay wages for the staff who created it and royalties to the author who wrote it, it's still a lot more affordable than buying that same book new in hardcover.

&gt; Readers have plenty of options to save money on book buying (buy used, wait for clearance sales, wait for windowing copies, borrowing from friends and libraries), so I can't sympathize with people who say e-book prices are too high. They just aren't.

Thank you everyone for helping me out with the research for my business idea. I think my original mission of ""showing publishers that it is economically beneficial to set lower prices for e-books"" will have to go back to the drawing board. The discussions over the past 24 hours have contributed a few alternative ideas, and I'd love to explore those as well.

Now the book deals a lot of what is seriously wrong with broadcasting in the United States, from Journalism, to children's programming, the FCC, indecency regulations, the myth of the liberal media, and radio broadcasting. Not only the book describes what's wrong with broadcasting the US, but also public broadcasting and the alphabet soup of film and video game rating systems which despite tiny changes don't fix the real problems.

But at the same time the book does detail solutions to solve the long standing issues surround the media and broadcasting in this country for so long.

I only sold three copies, and with the fact that I can't get any job in my with my BA in Government and Politics despite people in office that don't know jack about actually solving real problems (and me having a five-figure student loan debt) I want this book to get some sort of exposure.

I created the epub using InDesign, and it automatically generated the OPF file (and others). It declared that the document was an epub v2, when read aloud is only supported in v3. I made that small change, and got everything working perfectly.

Are ebook prices artificially inflated? After the SCOTUS ruling, I thought prices would go down, but I'm still seeing fifteen and twenty-dollar e-texts that are available in print for the same price. On sale, I've found them cheaper. 

I've heard people assert (not argue, mind, or even cite evidence in favor of a claim) that ebooks actually cost as much to produce as print books. Is this true? Is there a decent source that explains how this is remotely possible?

I do have a couple of questions, though:

* I've found scrolling/zooming in pdf-files on my kindle to be a major pain. Are other eReaders any better? I imagine that reading PDFs on a touch-reader (kobo?) would be more comfortable, but I have no way of testing this.

* I like my eBook for reading continuous texts, I've never tried using one as a reference book. How are your experiences with chapter navigation/search/skipping options in things like 1400-page reference books? How well can one navigate by using the registry?

It's like I witnessed the singularity first-hand. 

""Hear"" it is, however you'll have to press shift+ctrl+y in adobe reader to actually hear it. It's my ebook, and yes the table of contents is buggy. And I know all about that freaking title that isn't the right size. But it's all there. Up to 5 years of work, yet only 17k words. 

[Download](https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B-oa3sXb3nTgUF91Qy05Qnc2Vms) 

Press ctrl-s once you get to the doc. 

EDIT: I forgot to tell the tale. Well, I made a website and wanted to turn the website into a pdf but it proved very challenging because I don't have wordpress. So I just manually did it in Open Office, which has pdf functionality. It's a long road towards actually being published... I'd say another 17k or more words. It's 78 pages. For an anthology, I think double that would work. By christmas. Yes, that's realistic. Yesssss, my preciousssss.

I feel like a robot. 

MODS: In the title, I said entry-point. I'm a writer but I'm not promoting my e-book. I could care less if people download it.

My aunt (we live in France) wants to buy an ebook reader. She reads lots of American/English as well as French books, so the Kindle is the first thing to come to mind, but unfortunately in France the biggest ebook stores sell in EPUB format with DRM (she doesn't know much about computers). Amazon.fr barely sells ebooks.

So I'm going to suggest another ebook reader, but I still have no idea where she could buy American ebooks from France. As far as I know, amazon only sells ebooks for Kindles, Barnes &amp; Noble doesn't sell outside the US, and I don't know about Sony. I have no idea what other ebook stores there are.

In the beginning he despised the place, but before the end of his first year he was not only in love with Korea, but crazy about a woman named Gold Silver Jade, the Calypso who tore him away from his native New England and planted him so firmly into the soil of his adopted homeland that he was both unable—and unwilling—to escape.

[x-post from r/visualnovels]",Keric,3,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ebooks/comments/y25wp/we_need_testers_for_our_indie_visual_novel_themed/,"Test location (on Lightborne Lore's website): http://bit.ly/tstEBsbr

We’re curious what people think of our writing style and music direction, so we built a simple visual novel prototype using a 3,000-word chunk of the script draft. *This is a cross post from the Visual Novels subreddit, to see what readers of ebooks think of the content.*

The art, music, and voice acting are not final, but the same artists will be creating the final versions. The gameplay is also pre-beta, but it's functional.

We've built a feedback form into the app with a few questions and a field for comments, so please leave any feedback there.

*If you're downloading the PC executable (no install required), it may be ""unrecognized"" by your virus protection. I promise it's nothing shady, just an unrecognized program by an unknown developer (us).*

**For anyone interested in our development/prototyping process**: We'll be posting the results of our test (insight gained, changes made because of feedback) here once we process everything.

Thanks a ton, Reddit!
