The plans quickly changed from going out to dinner and a movie, to him coming to me and my husband's house to hang out with us until dinner, then everyone coming to a bonfire at our house afterwards. After arguing with him and trying to put him off from coming to my house for some time and explaining how messy it was, I finally gave up and took the hour before he was to arrive to power clean my living room. Once the living room was clear enough, I had to steam vacuum the carpet (spills and dog accidents that had been quickly soaked up.) I threw the dirty dishes from the counter into a sink of soapy water to disguise them, even though I wouldn't have time to wash them. I decided that clearing my hallway and bathroom floors of the dirty clothes that completely covered them would not be an option as my friend pulled up at my house( luckily my husband cleaned the toilet!)

I had never felt this level of anxiety about my house or realized how unacceptable my house was until an old friend (who I didn't necessarily need to impress but didn't want to disgust) was about to see it. How have I let it get this bad? I don't want to have to keep people from coming into my house anymore. I don't want to have to warn them about the mess before coming in. I don't want to feel embarrassed anymore when someone has to use my bathroom. If it isn't acceptable for someone else, why is it acceptable for me?? 

So I got up this morning and began to carry out my plan. I took before pictures of the living room and kitchen. I plan to use these so I can ""see"" the mess and clutter that I normally don't realize is there. Then, I started cleaning one small area at a time and with the help of this subreddit and Unfuck Your Habitat, I hope to have it done in the next couple days. 

The two roadblocks I have met recently are not having my husband's help and not having the money to purchase the shelving I need to properly contain the items in my bedroom. I hope to get my husband to at least keep ""his areas"" clear of garbage, then I can clear any clutter when I feel it needs to be, but getting him to deep clean with me and then keep clutter away hasn't happened yet. I also hope to purchase the bookshelf I need to help declutter my bedroom next week after payday. 

Sorry if this is kind of a lame post. I've been watching this subreddit for a few months and I keep wishing for more posts, so I decided I should be contributing more, too.

I want to know if other people have hit rock bottom, and what your rock bottom was or would be? Also, what roadblocks keep you from cleaning then maintaining a clutter-free home?

We've both had grandparents with overflowing house loads of stuff pass away recently and our parents kept bringing us boxes and boxes of STUFF. We live in an older home so there isn't a whole lot of room. 

Our house is full of STUFF. Maybe 40% toys, 40% deceased relative's belongings, and 20% things we actually use. We've joked about how we wouldn't mind if the house burned down while we were gone (not really, but...) just to be able to start with a clean slate. We're hoping to move in the next year and the amount of stuff we have is depressing. Overwhelming. Exhausting. If I set something down it can take anywhere from 20 minutes to a couple days to find it again. All the storage we have is full of plastic junk, vases, candy jars, plates, and all kinds of crap we aren't supposed to ever get rid of.

The other day I went to the dentist and he said I should stop drinking pop and switch to those sugar-free drink packets. Okay. I really shouldn't be drinking pop.

A couple days later I realize: what the flipping fuck. Here I am, drinking crystal light (mixed with metamucil) while sitting on a slipcovered sofa staring at dried flower arrangements. What the fuck. I'm 26. This is a load of balls.

Plus, it sets off my allergies, so it's really a health issue.

2) **Time.** I feel like a large part of my time is wasted looking for things that should already have a home. For example, even though I have a folder for it, tax time is a nightmare because I am always doing an emergency cleanup of some room before a guest comes over, and I forget where I stored important receipts. Then I have to spend my time digging through a couple of boxes full of paper rather than a singular, labeled folder.

3) **Happiness.** I come from a semi-hoardish family (poor, so we acquired as many ""deals"" as we could), and I have friends who don't seem happy unless they have plenty of possessions and money. I have always felt some sort of identity with them, but now I realize that things are actually making me UNhappy. Things are temporary, and so if they are destroyed, that would render me unhappy if I stored my happiness in possessions and money. I am tired of feeling like my possessions own me. I suppose all of it could really be summarized with this answer.

4) **Thinking about my next move.** I moved from a 650 sq. ft. apartment to an 1100 sq. ft. house plus a large basement. I have filled the space to the brim, and I am in a profession that could cause me to have to move on short notice. Moving sucks balls, so I'd rather move as little of it as possible.

5) **My relationship with my SO.** While clutter has never caused problems in my relationship, I can see how it might if it keeps getting worse. For example, I have a pretty good memory for where the most obscure object is likely to be located. However, my SO can barely find the things that are directly in front of him. I feel like the clutter is a little more my fault than his, so I feel like his frustrations in finding objects are partly my fault, and I don't want that to turn into resentment towards me. Clutter also stresses me out, and he is usually the one I vent to when I am stressed out - no need to place an unnecessary burden on him.

6) **I just need a change.** Every few years when life feels stale, I try to make room for new experiences. I believe that decluttering will make room for new experiences and ideas.

It's the other stuff, stuff I want to put on ebay or donate to the local library or give to a friend I don't see often that just sits there and collects dust. To help me organize my time better, I thought about following a theme each day where one thing should be done.

* [Flylady](http://flylady.net) -- 101 info here!
* [OutOfMilk](https://www.outofmilk.com/default.aspx) -- Android, iOS, PC app for creating lists

Another user suggested [HabitRPG](https://habitrpg.com/static/front) in a thread last week, a sort of game for keeping up with your habits.

&gt;    A keystone is the wedge-shaped stone piece at the apex of a masonry vault or arch, which is the final piece placed during construction and locks all the stones into position, allowing the arch to bear weight.

[Pictures and Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_%28architecture%29)    

Basically, it's the top, middle piece in an arch. Without it the arch is not stable enough to be built on.

**What does a keystone have to do with decluttering?**

In each room in my house, there is **one task or chore that I call the keystone**. 

 * If the keystone task isn't done, then clutter just happens. 
 * If the keystone task is done, then all my other systems work and clutter is vastly reduced or doesn't happen.

**How can I identify a keystone?**    

Trial and error or observation both worked for me. 

Basically if there isn't a place to put something, then i'll put it temporarily on a surface. Clutter begets clutter and soon it is a free for all. I start putting anything down that is in my hands, telling myself ""I'll get to it later."" Soon I have a pile of assorted stuff and a lot more work to put things away.

**My Keystones**

Room | Keystone | Comments| 
:--|:--:|:--| 
**Kitchen** |  **Dishwasher** (Fill, run, and empty)| The bulk of the dishes are cleaned in there. If it is full and not washed, or washed and not emptied, then the dirty dishes pile up on the countertop. | 
**Living Room**  | **Floor** (Pick up stuff at the end of the day) | Nothing belongs on the floor in the living room except the furniture. If there are toys on the floor or a blanket, then I can't run the vacuum. Instead of thinking ""oh now I can turn on the vacuum"" I think first I have to do this task. Neither task gets done. | 
**Bathroom** | **Counter top** (Put everything away in the medicine cabinet after using it.) | Similar to the Floor in the living room, nothing belongs there except the soap dipenser. It takes me less than five minutes to wipe all the surfaces in the bathroom, if I don't have to stop and put things away first. | 
**Bedroom** | **Bed** (Make the bed, put on day cover) | The bed is the central point of the room. Just pulling up the duvet, fluffing the pillows, and throwing the day cover over it, I have a calm, clean place.| 
**Hallway** | **Jackets, shoes, bags** (Put them away) | The hallway should really always be empty. As soon as one person doens't put away their things the next person doesn't either.|
**Kid's Room**  | **Kid** (it's their room, teach them how to organize) | As easy as it seems to put everything away myself, I took the time to establish places for specific toys. The books go on the bookshelf, the puzzles are in the grey cabinet, the play food goes in the ""refrigerator"" (wooden drawers from ikea painted with the type of food that belongs in the drawer). When I get asked ""Mama where is..."" I say ""did you put it away in the ... place?"" I don't go look for it. If I find a forgotten toy somewhere else, I ask ""Did you want to get rid of this toy or should it go back in the ... place?"" Obviously, it's quickly snatched from my hands and properly returned to its place.  **TL;DR If it is someone else's space it's better to spend your energy helping create areas rather than picking up after them** |

The graveyard contained uncounted years of parts, broken equipment, spares, packaging, files, and ""OMG What is THIS???""

I spent my first week getting oriented around the plant and the server room, meeting the people and getting an idea of what they needed from me.  I spent an hour or two in the graveyard and quickly realised this was going to have to be nibbled away at.  Part of the reason was that I didn't know what the ""context"" was of some of this junk.  Hell I even found a rifle under the server room floor (go figure).

So I came up with this idea:  I set an alarm on my phone for 4:30pm every Friday.  They had a staff B-B-Q and drinks at that time each week so everybody wound down.  Also I could get away with wearing jeans so the decent pants didn't get ruined by the graveyard dust.

Every Friday at 4:30 I'd take a beer into the graveyard and start sorting through stuff.  Every time something went into the bin/recycling.

Every Friday at 4:30.  Beer/Bin/recycling.

It took the entire 4+ years to get through this monumental pile of crap, but as thing progressed I was able to store and organize the things we needed to keep.  Creating space and order as I went.

By the time I moved on there was a semblance of organisation amongst the chaos.

I'm at a different location now and it'll be 5 years here in October.  It's taken until now to get things to the point that I'm starting to get happy but the graveyard alarm stays with me.

I've been thinking the last few days about the recent post by     
/u/marpstar entitled [The Evil of Storage Containers](http://redd.it/1igotp).*

/u/marpstar's argument was:
 &gt; ...storage containers are the absolute worse thing you can buy if you're trying to organize your home. In the process of decluttering my house, I've found that these storage containers are more often than not just being used to hide away all of the crap you're not really using. Much like a junk drawer in the kitchen...

----

**The Usefulness of Storage Containers** or    
 
 **The Evil of Purchasing Things for the Sake of Decluttering**

A storage container is a useful tool in decluttering when it is given     
a single purpose. A principle of decluttering is that every item has     
its own permanent place and a only one place for every item.

**The storage container does not behave badly the declutter does:**

When you are starting to declutter, you are just beginning to learn    
techniques to help you organize, merge, assess. Without learning   
techniques it is easy to throw unlike items in one container and   
it is out of sight, out of mind. This is why it quickly becomes a ""junk    
drawer"". Each container in your house should have only one purpose.   
Label it clearly, on the top and on the side, so you will remember   
what that purpose is. Then stick to it. 

**A simple solution for merging and assessing:**    

During the process of decluttering before you know what you  
want to keep and what you don't a storage container can become  
a ""unique, permanent place"" to help you merge items. This helps you    
get an idea of how big the real permanent place needs to be for that  
item. Then you can start looking out for cleared spaces in your house   
that will accomodate it. I've often filled a storage box and realized,     
hey this would fit in that cabinet I just cleared out. It is then as   
simple as walking to the next room with the box and unpacking  
it in its new home. If you do realize that these items need a specific   
home, then shopping for furniture becomes easier since you know   
exactly the dimensions of the space.


**A storage container is like a trial separation:**    

Once like items are merged in their storage box, you can also put a lid   
on it (add a re-open by date to it),  walk away and gain some    
(emotional) distance from the items in there. I've done this before for   
a collection of books and when I went back to it, I only kept 1 book out    
the of 20. The space I had gained from putting that collection to the    
side, gave me much more joy than the 19 books I got rid of.


 
**The best storage container is free:**     

Buying things to declutter is counterproductive. Buying a storage     
container is not a good way to start decluttering.The truth is after       
the stuff is gone, then there is no more use for that storage        
container. An item without a use is clutter.

Any box, any bag, any crate, any basket can be a  storage     
container. I do personally buy moving boxes for less than a       
dollar a box to help us declutter. Then I use them to bring the     
decluttered items to the donation place. The sunk cost is worth       
the ability to get rid of it easily.

The only purchase you should consider is not for decluttering, but for    
a permanent home  for the things you know you want to keep. That     
should be done at the end of decluttering not at the beginning and     
probably not in the middle. Resist that urge and you will probably   
find that you have enough space already.

I didn't think I could. In fact I had a really hard time, especially since I had already tidied up this morning and gotten rid of loads of trash and put things in their proper home throughout the house.

I have been going through the archives of [ufyh.tumblr.com](http://unfuckyourhabitat.tumblr.com) and stumbled across [this post](http://unfuckyourhabitat.tumblr.com/post/16785210002/wearediscovered-50-things-i-no-longer-own) which led me to [this blog post](http://www.theartofdoingstuff.com/throw-away-50-thingsright-now/). I read that post and the comments below and decided I wanted to get rid of 50 things, right now!

I did not count actual garbage (napkins, gum wrappers, etc). I found 50 things that are going to be tossed, recycled, or permanently relocated out of my bedroom and into another, more appropriate location in the house.

Gone are:

* 4 coke bottle caps (I hoard them until I enter the codes!)
* a ziploc bag
* a plastic knife (Panera gave me like 6 of every utensil when I went last time...for 2 bowls of soup)
* 2 sugar packets
* a plant food packet that I never used
* 2 envelopes
* nail polish remover
* 3 expired or I won't use this coupons
* 2 comment cards to be mailed off
* set of healing stones that I got in a redditgifts exchange which I will be passing on to a friend
* 2 water bottles that have been sitting in an unused purse for months
* a no longer played with cat toy
* 9 receipts
* 2 cardboard earring holders
* sack of toasted soy beans that I'm not sure of the age on
* box of expired keurig coffees that were a gift that never got sent (I'm terrible at mailing :( )
* 5 condiment packets 
* 2 empty food packages
* 2 packs of health food I got in a monthly subscription box that I am not interested in, going to throw them in the pantry and see if anyone else eats them
* empty sanitizer bottle
* flyer that came with this months Better Homes &amp; Gardens with coupons I am not interested in
* 2 kleenex boxes
* used wrapping paper
* 2 more gifts from the aforementioned never shipped box

That brings me to...50 items. I ended up having to clean out a purse to keep finding things! But I'm sure I could have looked other places as well. Not counted are the innumerable gum wrappers, kleenexes, napkins, pieces of plastic from...something?

So today, right now, look around and see how many things YOU can find....try for 50! It did not take long at all, maybe 10 minutes at most, and I was also fiddling with my youtube playlist and putting other things away too.

But, she never asks for it back, never comes out to visit, and never offers to send some money to have it shipped to her.  Not to mention, she left it behind to begin with.  I don't think we should have to pay for it, and I think it is well past it's expiration date.  I want to throw it out.  Is that a no-no?

Update:  I would like to thank everyone for the feedback.  I decided for the time being to repurpose the canvas so it can be utilized in the house.  So, for the time being it is put to use and not cluttering my house, but at the same time I'm not spending money we can't afford right now to ship it, and if she suddenly decided she wants it back, I can easily remove the fabric I covered it with and she can make her arrangements to send it.

1366872732.0,34,self.declutter,1d2i82,Decluttering Technique: Limited Space,parle,38,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1d2i82/decluttering_technique_limited_space/,"**Things Tend to Disperse**

A common example is pens. They are in every room in your house - in drawers, on shelves, on your desktop, in purses. The idea behind it is you can never have enough so that you can always find one when you need it. Actually, it's often the case that it's not in the first place you look and you go around looking for a pen. This confirms the idea that you can never have enough pens.

**Every Thing Has a Place and Every Thing in Its Place**

You only need the one pen when you want to write something down, so really if you had one place wherer pens are then you would just have to go to that one place.

**Assigning Places**

There's another benefit to having just one place for each item, it helps you limit the number of one type of object.This is very useful when it comes to thing you keep around because you like them. 

**Using Limited Space to Make a Collection**

For example, I like pretty vases and colored glass bottles. The vases have a purpose, the glass bottles are either refilled with something or I keep them as a vase. Basically I like the way each item looks and when I get flowers I am happy that I have a few different sizes to choose from.

[Pictures here](http://imgur.com/HeGn5b1)

 * **Pick a Space:** Clear off an area for your collection. To choose the area: Think about how often you need to access the items. Does it bring you joy to see the objects? Then think about showcasing them on a shelf. In my case, I gave them a square of my kitchen shelves. When I fill a vase with flowers I can fill it with water easily and I arrange the flowers on the kitchen table. Also I enjoy the how they look in the light from the window. 
 * **Gather:** The rroblem was, I had them all over the house. They were on a side table, the top of book shelf,  the window sill, and in drawers. So, I gathered them all. 19 vases. 
 * **Evaluate:** Seeing them together helped me compare what I had. If they were pens, I would evaluate them by the criteria of *working* or *not working*. When it comes to object like vases the decisions are more about developing your sense of style and taste.  First thing I saw was that I had mostly greens and blues. I also have a few favorite older pieces in Gründerzeit to Jugendstil style. The 1970s vase is nice, but didn't look as nice when compared to the others. I like the glass bottles in the light, but if I change my mind and want them back  I could just buy another soda and keep that bottle. So my criteria for judging was *color*, *style*, and *availability*.
 * **Arrange:** Now put the items in their space. This Limited Space is the only space in your house for these items when they aren't in use. If a vase doesn't fit in the Limited Space you chose, then first decide if it is really worth keeping. If you decide to keep it, then you need to pick a different Limited Space. You are not allowed to have two spaces devoted to the same object. 
 * **Maintain:** That's it. You now have a collection. You can add things to your collection, but most likely you will have to get rid of some objects so that you have enough space. Take them out once in a while, clean the area, dust the objects...the dust will help you see which ones you never use. Sell those or give them as a gift to someone. 

The benefit is, that if you chose only the nicest pieces at the beginning, then you don't have junk. Your collection is made up of things of value. For example, an old 70s vase will probably go for 50 cents at a flea market but the Jugendstil vase I can sell for 10 Euros. Then I can continue  to use it or I can sell it for a good price when the opportunity presents itself.  Or, back to the first example, if I have pens that work and I can find it every time I need it, I save money or time not having to go out an get more pens.

Keep in mind, this is a **one week** challenge! Don't go overboard, I imagine we'll be coming back to this topic!

Please make sure to not run out and buy organizers before you know exactly what you will be organizing! Focus on sorting through your paper clutter. You want your organizers to suit your needs, not make your needs suit your organizer!

***

**Casual**: Declutter all paper that is not already inside something (like a binder, folder, bin, etc.). You can do this all at once by collecting up all these bits of paper, or pile-by-pile as you go. 

Extra: Stack all unsorted folders and bins of paper together.

**Normal**: Declutter all the paper from a single area (bin, filing cabinet, room). Make sure to look inside all folders and cabinets and everything for EVERY scrap of paper within your designated area! Again, you can do it all at once if you prefer, or section by section.

Extra: Clean off a space like a desk or a dining room table and use that as your organizing station. Just make sure all the papers have a home by the end of the week!

**Hard**: Find a large workspace, and collect up all your supplies (recycle bin, shredder, filing box). Grab a bin or laundry basket and hunt down all the paper you can find. You might have to do this a few, or even several, times. Turn it into a game with your kids, roommate, SO, or self.

On your large workspace, start sorting the papers into piles by category. Use whatever sorting process makes sense to you. Focus on sorting only, if that suits you, or toss things as you go. When you're done, you should have more manageable piles to tackle individually.

Extra: If you don't have a large workspace, go by sections (like a drawer, or single shelf).

***


**Paperwork you must keep**:[1](http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/5-steps-to-simpler-record-keeping-10000000688976/index.html)  [2](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/how-long-to-keep-financial-records.aspx)

These should be filed first, since they will most likely not be needed but should be kept together.

**Mail**: It's a good idea to shred anything with your name and address on it, but not necessary. The choice is yours. Generally, try and toss all junk mail immediately. Toss magazines or circulars you don't want, as well. For bills, designate a place where they will be paid and sit them there. 

**Work/School Papers**: Work for current projects/clients/classes should be organized in or near your workspace for easy reference. For completed work/school projects (particularly with school) reevaluate keeping every paper. Most of that information is available online. For work, follow the requirements of your job or employer with what you should be keeping. Sort and purge the rest.

**Kids**: This can include [artwork](http://www.nourishingjoy.com/conquering-clutter-what-to-do-with-kids-artwork/), [school projects](http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/kids-storage-00100000064587/) and assignments/exams, as well as permission slips and report cards. 

Create an action file where all the papers from their backpack get sorted after school. An example could be: completed assignments, homework, and forms/report cards that must be filled out.

In this case, my goal is not to get everything as clean and uncluttered as I can, but to get it back to a point where I can get some work done. I have about 10 hours of work/schoolwork scheduled today, and the mess was getting in the way of productivity. The cleanup shown in the pictures took 30 minutes, including the time it took to take the pictures and to move stuff around for pictures so my name and address wasn't on top of any of the piles. Actual cleaning time - 20ish minutes. 

Mostly, I wanted to show that for many people, including myself, decluttering is not a goal, but an ongoing process.

**There are four basic ways to get rid of stuff:**

 * **Sell/Give as a present:** This means the value of the item is apparent. If I can sell it, I can also give it to friends or family as a present. I use this formula to decide that the value is high enough:
  * If I can find examples of the used item selling for 1/3 of the original value and that amount is more than 10€ then it is worth the time to sell it. Unless I am planning to set up a flea market table then I will sell anything that is worth more than 1€. What I don't sell gets donated directly after the flea market.
  * Examples: Working electronics, wearable brand name clothes, sturdy furniture, decorative items. Everything should be clean and working. 
 * **Donate:** Although the item is still useful, the item is so plentiful that there is little chance of getting good money back for it. Research to whom you donate and find out if you can get a tax write off for the items. 
  * Examples: Clothing, unused or sanitized toilettries, household items, furniture, books, arts and crafts supplies, sporting equipment. [More here](http://redd.it/19a078)
 * **Recycle** Before I put anything in the trash, I check what can be recycled or properly disposed of and if there are any collections going on for that item. 
  * Examples: Old electronics, scrap fabric, paper, wood, plastic, metal, old paint/toxic chemicals, glass, compost etc. 
 * **Trash** This is really the last resort. But it is often the first items I pick out to declutter. Trash for me mean no value. A broken hair tie or a dirty tissue. There's actually very little that needs to go in the trash can.

**Build an Exit Plan**

Before you start, go through the four ways mentioned above and decide:

 * How much does an item have to be worth to consider selling it. While you are decluttering you will be guessing at the worth of the item. 
 * What charities would be interested in these items? While you are decluttering all donate items can be grouped together or you can already fill a bag for clothing/toiletries donation to a shelter and book donation to a library.  
 * Make a pile of broken manufactured goods. Most materials can be recycled.
 * Have a garbage bag handy.     



**Lastly put your Exit Plan into action**
 
 1. Start with Sell: Look up the current market value and used value for the item. Anything not worth it can go into your donate boxes. 
 2. Look up opening times for drop off or schedule a pick up from the charity.
 3. Clearly label all recycables and bring them to recycling center/call for pick up/have them ready to be put out on recycling day.
 4. Garbage.

If you look around you right now could you picture what the room would look like with nothing in it? It's harder than it sounds.

Why is that? 

The point of this not to advocate living in empty rooms. Rather, I would like to talk about how many things we have around us that we no longer see, because they are just part of the scenery. 


My approach to decluttering has changed a lot.

* When I first started decluttering I got rid of things that I no longer planned to use. 
* Later I opened up storage areas and got rid of things I no longer needed and that I knew were replaceable. 
* I almost completely stopped buying things and try to stick to the one in-one out system when I do.
* Then I started comparing items and only keeping a choice few.

Going through those steps, I have three clutter-free rooms: the kitchen, the bathroom and the living room. 

I've tried that now on our multi-purpose room a few times but clutter keeps coming back. The space is cramped, you have to move everything aside to get to what you need, piles form... it's not getting better. 

Recently, I read 2 things that reminded me how quickly something becomes commonplace. How quickly it is that we stop noticing things!

So, I sat down in the multipurpose room and realized I was just decluttering the surfaces and compartments of things but not the room.  It is a big room, not cramped at all.  I have no systematic way of organizing the different uses of the room, so anytime I use it I just use the middle. Also the piles form because I can't put away things that are in the far side of the room until the middle is clear.

I have a plan now and I'll be working on it this weekend.

All it took was remembering what it looked like when it was empty.

**What point are you at now? Can you say you're clutter-free?**


Clutter comes off in layers. First I got rid of the really obvious things I didn't need.   Once, I got rid of those things, I got used to that, and I began to notice another layer of excess.  Next, I got rid of that. Rinse repeat. As such, I’d say excepting extreme cases, one is almost never truly clutter free. 

I am at a point where its harder to find things to get rid of--the layers aren’t as obvious.  I don’t have much I don’t use.  There are still things there though that I don’t need and lately I’ve been focusing on the less obvious clutter in my life like my online presence, things I use quite a bit but perhaps I don’t really need, minimizing my digital possessions, etc. There are still layers for me to get rid of. 


**What was the turning point that led to you starting to declutter? What inspired you? What makes you want to keep your space clean and clutter-free?**


Consuming less in every way from cutting empty calories from my diet to owning fewer pairs of shoes that will eventually end up in the landfill to reducing my media consumption allows me to having more money to help others, spend on experiences and better quality items of the things I do still need. It also helps me reduce my carbon footprint. Additionally, freeing yourself from needing/ having/ wanting/ babysitting all that stuff puts more money in your pocket and gives you more time for more important things. Health benefits: tending away from having a house full of stuff designed for your convenience is good for you. Using your muscles instead of some device you plug into the wall or run on a motor has health benefits-- i.e. simply raking your leaves instead of owning a leaf blower and other fancy motor-powered lawn equipment. In conclusion, The more stuff I got rid of, the better I felt spiritually, financially, environmentally, physically (because I was using more muscle over motors), etc. Less really is more. 


**What was easier to do than you thought? What was harder? What is your biggest frustration or pet peeve when it comes to decluttering?**


It was easier that I thought. Slimming down what I own and thinking more about what I need has been pretty enlightening for me. The hardest thing for me has been not buying new stuff. Also, I have lots of hobbies, so it’s kind of frustrating because I still feel like I have a lot of stuff, but much of it is essential for my hobbies: rock climbing gear, biking gear, sewing machine and fabrics, etc.)  



**Can you tell us about what systems or techniques that you found most useful?**

1.	Do it layer by layer. No need to do it all at once. First get rid of the really obvious things you don't need. Then get used to that, then you'll see another layer of things you thought you needed that now you see you don't need. Get rid of that. Rinse repeat. No need to do anything drastic. It's a journey. The act of decluttering can in itself be very rewarding.

2.	Walk or bike to the grocery store. This has cleared out my pantry/refrigerator tremendously and slashed my grocery bill by probably 50% or more. I buy way less because I have to really prioritize and it has helped me cut out a lot of empty calories (like sodas for example) because they're heavy to carry and I'd rather use that space in my backpack for something a little more important nutrition-wise like meats or vegetables. The food clutter in my pantry has almost vanished. This is not feasible for everyone, but if it is possible for you, I'd recommend giving it a shot!

3.	Try to actually eat up all or most of the food you already have before going grocery shopping again. If I’m feeling sorry for myself for having to eat something that I don’t want to eat, I should make a note not to buy that in the future. If I’m not going to eat it, I should just throw it away, and move on with my life making sure not to buy that in the future.

4.	Make more deliberate buying choices. Its not about self control or austerity or anything like that, but rather about changing your mindset. When I first started reading about voluntary simplicity, I became convinced that it was pretty much a superior way of living, but agreeing with a philosophy is much easier than changing a lifetime of habits. It was easy to get rid of old things that I didn't use, but much harder to not buy new things. Especially things that I knew I really would use but didn't necessarily need. In the beginning, I was actually spending more money because my house was like a revolving door where I was getting rid of a lot of stuff, but also bringing a lot of stuff in--even more so than before. I think placing that emphasis in my mind about not buying almost made me want to buy more. It's like when someone says don't think about elephants--the first thing you think about is elephants. Really jonesing for something, but not allowing yourself to buy it is unpleasant and very hard to stick to. The trick is to gradually stop wanting (admittedly easier said than done). I was able to get rid of this constant desire for stuff by making more deliberate buying choices. If there's something that I really want (not on a whim, but for a substantial period of time) even though I know I don't need it, I've found it's better to just suck it up and buy it. I had thought that giving in wouldn't solve anything because the desire for that thing would just be replaced by another desire for another thing, but I found that that's not usually the case. Doing the research to find a well-designed good-quality product keeps me from buying a lot of stuff (even when its hurts because its a big upfront investment). Before, when I really wanted something, but I knew I didn't need it or it was too expensive, etc., I would not allow myself to buy it and maybe try to find a cheaper alternative. This cheaper alternative would never really quench that desire though. I was still jonesing for the thing I had wanted initially and would buy another cheaper alternative thinking that maybe that one would satisfy the want. Rinse repeat. (I would do this with clothes for example). Eventually, I ended up with a houseful clutter. Now I try to just buy the expensive/ better quality product from the get-go (after doing adequate research) and it ends up saving me money in the long run. (I posted something similar from a different account I used to have so if this sounds similar, that’s why).

5.	Ask “Do I need this?” not “Do I / Would I use this?”  Just because you would or do use it, doesn’t mean you need to keep it around. For example, I once owned a vacuum cleaner and I used it quite a bit. However, since my apartment has all concrete floors, I realized that I don’t need a vacuum it since a good old fashioned broom and dustpan do the job just fine. Just because I use it and it makes my life more convenient doesn’t mean it’s worth having around. Re-evaluate: do you really need it or does it just make your life more convenient.

6.	If you feel like you’re trapped in a cycle where you’re bringing in too much, try placing a hold on buying anything new for 1 month (other than groceries and other essentials). I’ve done this before and when I did it, I still allowed myself to buy used stuff.  This way if there’s something you really want, you will have to check at the thrift store or on ebay first. This is good for your wallet and the environment. Not everything you buy needs to be new anyways.

7.	Reducing the amount of mail you get by:
a.	Changing the setting for your bank statements, etc. to be digital only
b.	use Catalog Choice to request to be removed from mailing lists like L.L.Bean or ASPCA or whoever else sends you mail that you don’t read. The environment will thank you for this as well. 

8.	Reduce papers and notebooks that you don’t know what to do with by using Evernote. I thought scanning all that stuff in would be a huge pain in the ass, but I just take a picture with my iPhone and its no big deal. You can simply take a photo the regular way using your iPhone camera, but I usually either use Genius Scan (the pro version lets you upload directly to Evernote), or more often I just use the ""scan"" feature in Evernote itself, which simply processes the image to maximize contrast and reduce noise. Keeping track of stacks of papers is a pain in the ass! Plus I have all my notes with me everywhere I go on my phone (also on my laptop/ iPad obviously). Additionally, my back isn't sore at the end of the day anymore from toting around books and notebooks and folders.

9.	Minimizing your online presence.
 .	Instead of deleting junk mail, unsubscribe-- almost any email you get from anyone other than a human being probably has an unsubscribe button at the bottom. Instead of going through and deleting dozens of emails every time you login, take the 3 extra seconds to simply unsubscribe from that mailing list. 
a.	Consolidate accounts-- make sure you’re the same email address for everything
b.	Delete unused accounts. Still have a MySpace account? Delete it! Have a Twitter account, but never Tweet? Delete it!
c.	Delete FaceBook “friends” you don’t care to keep in touch with. 

10.	Consolidate &amp; minimize your digital possessions by:
 .	Sync your contacts between devices. How I did it: Instead of having certain contacts on my phone, different contacts on my computer, different contacts on gmail, etc., I’ve switched them all to be in Google contacts. If you use Apple products like me, you can then sync that with Mail.app on your computer and Contacts on your iPhone using CardDAV (see here for more info). 
a.	Keep your calendar digital and sync it between devices. How I did it: Much like with my contacts above, I switched all my calendars to Google Calendars and synced it between my devices using CalDAV (see here for more info on syncing Google Calendars with the Apple ecosystem) The great thing about using Google’s stuff is you can either access on your phone/ computer, etc. or on any computer anywhere using your Google login information. With Google’s 2-step verification login system, it’s still very secure.
b.	Erase songs you don’t like from your iTunes library. If you still keep CDs around, digitize them, then get rid of them. 
c.	Delete photos you wouldn’t care if you lost. Deleting photos was hard for me at first. A while back though, I had some computer trouble and I was worried about losing certain photos of family members that are no longer around, favorite family memories, etc. Most everything else I didn’t care about. My computer ended up being okay and I didn’t lose the files, but it made me think that if I didn’t care if I lost all those photos, why did I need to even keep copies of them on my computer? I deleted photos I didn’t care about and the ones I did care about I now keep in Dropbox (if you don’t have a Dropbox account, you should get one , so I won’t lose the important ones if something does happen to my computer. 
d.	Get rid of old document files you no longer need. If its an important paper I spent a long time on and think I might go back and read later or use for something else, I put it in a folder called Archive in my Dropbox or if its something that I am currently working on, I keep it in Google Drive (see below). Realistically though, no matter how much time I may have spent on it, I am never going to look at most old papers again. 
e.	Use Google Drive to make new documents. I don’t even have Microsoft Office on my computer. Google Drive is better for almost all the things I need to do in almost every way: its free, it runs faster, it allows collaboration, it saves as you go so you don’t have to worry about Microsoft Word crashing and all your work being lost, you can access it from anywhere, if something happens to your computer, you won’t lose anything. 


**Is there anything about your space that makes it more challenging to be clutter-free (i.e. lack of cupboards/storage? Too much storage?)?**


I think it really helps that I have a pretty small apartment. Also, since I don’t have too much expendable income, the thought of renting a storage unit or something like that would be absolutely out of the question.

Today is the day to look at storage related clutter.

**Storage Questions to ask followed by suggested decluttering task:**
 
**Storage Areas and Usage:** What areas do I use for storage? What things are in them? Don't forget storage is any place something is just sitting in and not being used for its intended purpose. So include 

 * [food storage](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/10qvwm/clutter_challenge_3_food_clutter/),  
 * [cleaning supplies storage](http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/under-sink-storage-00100000077884/page4.html) [+](http://www.kfh.org/services/freeservices/download_files/guidelines_for_storage_of_cleaning_supplies_poisons.pdf) [+](http://www.bhg.com/homekeeping/house-cleaning/tips/cleaning-supplies-storage/), 
 * [bed linens](http://unclutterer.com/2011/02/17/storing-bed-sheets/), 
 * [pots and pans](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/192nmg/store_it_saturday_daily_decluttering_theme/c8k90ec), 
 * [digital storage](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/192nmg/store_it_saturday_daily_decluttering_theme/c8kewzr), 
 * [email inboxes](http://inboxzero.com/) 
 * [paper](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/19si42/where_does_your_clutter_come_from/c8r7roy)

 * Task (10-20 mins): Make a list of storage areas and what type of things are where. Is there a rhyme and reason to your organization? Use a simple rating system if the storage is accessible and you know what is there, then it gets a check mark. If it is a black box, then a question mark to show that it needs work. Click on the links above to research systems and suggestions.
  * [Attic Storage Organizing Checklist](http://www.realsimple.com/home-organizing/organizing/more-rooms/attic-organizing-checklist-00000000002161/index.html)

**Sesonal Items:** Do you only need something once a year or every few months? 

  * Task (15+ minutes): Put it away. I'm talking to you, Dad, it's time to take down those Christmas lights. Does it have its own box or space to put it away in? Find one. Is it labelled? Label it. Examples: Summer/Winter clothes, seasonal decoration

**Museum Vault:** Can't part with it, but it just sits there and gathers dust? 

  * Task (20 minutes): Then reduce your decorations and switch them out everyonce in awhile. Just like Museums do, you can have Exhibits of your stuff. Take a dresser top that has too many vases, candles, pictures, junk. Clear it off completely. Put a few things back on that look nice. Put the rest in storage in a few days/weeks/months open the box and switch the items out. Don't forget to label.

**Clear Storage Space:** Why am I keeping this? We've all packed boxes in a hurry to get it out of the way. Face your demons.
 
 * Task (15-30 minutes): Take 1 unlabeled box or object out of storage. Declutter the one box. Sort into Keep, Sell, Donate, Garbage, piles. (This can give you a task for Sell it Sunday or Take it out Tuesday.) 

**What about you?**

 * Any storage decluttering related tasks that you have planned? 
 * Ask questions about storage problems
 * Add ideas for task suggestions.
 * Please post any storage related sucesses in the comments. Show us a before and after picture. (You don't have to have done it on a Saturday.)
 * Links to articles about storage or other posts.

I've always considered moving to a new place as a great time to really go through my belongings and organize as I pack.  Today I noticed every time I move to a new place, I find myself reading/skimming through my copy of Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha.  I love this book on many levels, but on a more superficial one, it always gives me the motivation to get rid of stuff I don't really need.  There is a point in the story when all he owns is the clothing on his back and a begging bowl.  It's a jump, I know, but it leads me to think things like, ""do I really need my outdated text books from college, or birthday cards from 3 years ago?""  I often feel guilty for trying not to be so sentimental.  But me being sentimental often leads to merciless clutter and this book gives me the strength I need to just let go!  I have noticed, however, that this super-strength and new perspective on my belongings is only temporary.  Once I make my decision, I usually have to act on letting the items go fairly quickly, before I weaken and lose my resolve.  Tonight, I packed 3 boxes of books to donate.  Tomorrow, I'm ravaging through my cd collection.

TL:DR; Every time I move to a new place, the book Siddhartha motivates me to get rid of a bunch of stuff I don't need.

I find myself holding on to things for other people all too often.

The main offender is books. I read a TON and constantly think of other people who would like the book I just finished. So I keep it for them... I end up with a ton of books I'm done with waiting to be re-homed. Then, I had a lightning-strike revelation: **That's what the library is for.**

I'm not the library. If I think of someone when I read a book, I just think to send them an email with the title. If they want it and don't claim it before the next run to the thrift store (where I get all my books for a quarter!) then too bad - they can go to the library.

The second offender was clothing. This is a little harder because I feel my sisters could use some of my second-hand clothing (not to sound like my clothes are that great, just that I know they like to look through things before I take them to the thrift store!) and there isn't really a ""library"" answer to that... but oh well, my space is my space and I can't hang on to things forever.

My closet is very organized but I feel overwhelmed everyday by choices and boredom with the items inside (even though some are pretty new). I need some help with getting rid of this stuff and maybe some ideas on how to better store my clothes or some kind of rotation system? I don't want to throw everything away because like I said I like a lot of variety - but this is just getting ridiculous. Thank you! :)

Right now my sidewalk is strewn with soil, pulled weeds, a soil bag and it bothers me because my husband (the landscaper, another annoying detail) left it that way.  There are tools on the steps leading to the sidewalk that have been there for weeks now.  His station in the living room is a mess.  

All of this is because I've got this dumb stand off going and I don't think I should have to deal with it.  But when I look around my living room I see spots I'm more responsible for that I imagine to the foreign eye would be indistinguishable from my husband's corner.

My son has been uploading YouTube videos and I see my house and cringe, realizing how this mess I live in really depends on no one seeing it.  I'm also depressed to a point of inaction on many things.  I've been in therapy for months now and still haven't figured out how to be OK with the mess my family makes.

I am so tired of cleaning up after everyone, it seems like it is all I do.  I try daily to encourage them to do the bare minimum (pick up the dirty clothes you left in the bathroom and at LEAST toss them into the stairwell so I can take them to the washer) but they don't improve.

I've been throwing a lot out over the last couple weeks in an attempt to have less to be responsible for.

There's so much deep stuff for me with all this.  I grew up in a filthy hoarder house, have managed to live fairly clutter free until buying this house, which is unfinished and feels like that contributes to it somehow.  Maybe the vibe of the unfinished house makes it OK for me to not be tidy?  I've got my own resentment toward cleaning because it feels menial and demeaning and I want something greater for myself (though I have been debilitated and not living to my potential for so long).  I don't think cleaning is menial, per se, I am just not one of these mothers/wives that gets off on homemaking.  My husband works hard all day and when he gets home he doesn't want to do anything considered ""work"" and doesn't have the energy for it, either.  While I *could* affect change all by myself I don't think I should have to, it's not just my job.  Plus there are things I literally CAN'T deal with because I'm not physically strong enough to move (like a trailer, an engine, old mowers, etc.)  Then I get sad because I have plenty evidence that tells me these things will be like this for 6, 12, 18, 24 months.  I don't bother asking my husband for anything because the answer is always no, he's too tired.  So frustrating.

I am so depressed, I feel trapped.  I'm going to head to my basement now and try to make a dent.  I just had to get this out, it feels like I just barfed.

I've had a few weeks of feeling really positive. Thus far I've been doing just small things around the house. A few drawers here and there and so on, slowly letting my Mum know that I'm fucking serious about sorting this shit out. I occasionally show mum articles I've read about decluttering and cool ideas I've found here and there. I try and put a really positive spin on it to make it seem less threatening. More like I'm trying to help out rather than forcing her to do something she doesn't want to do, but nothing is getting through.

I've seen the tip of using a shoe organiser to keep cleaning stuff in so I forked out 15 quid to get a clear one so the bathroom airing cupboard can be [less of a frigging nightmare](http://imgur.com/a/CEZ3C). When I mentioned that I was going to get one because I thought it was a really good idea my mum (half) jokingly asked me when I was planning on moving out. Ha ha ha. 

She's been reorganising the kitchen. Reorganising is just cleaning stuff and putting it back somewhere else and very little ever gets thrown away. One day when she went to work she left a note asking me to empty and clean the cupboards in the kitchen, mainly the cupboards with food in. Ok! Every cupboard was half and half. Half kitchen utensils, crockery etc and food. I gave up on the food and instead went round the house and collected [every cup, mug and glass we had](http://imgur.com/DlP1vVb). This isn't every single item, there are a few glass sets I didn't bring in and some mugs on the dresser.

In an attempt to make this seem like less of an assault I put a whole load of mugs that I didn't have to think twice about getting rid of at one end, others I knew she would have a hard time getting rid of next and then ones I thought we should keep. I explained it all the her when she got back and she seemed ok with it. She liked the idea that I suggested we swap out the nice mugs we have on the dresser with the seasons (I read about displaying things like a museum on here, kind of changing the 'exhibit' every now and then). When I was at work over the next few days the mugs and cups had diminished.

I had my suspicions that nothing would change and it hasn't. All the mugs have gone back to their original hiding place. Every one. I can't deal with this any more. I'm trying to help but this wall of resistance is making me lose my patience. It's making me want to take every god damn thing in this fucking house and burn it. I never throw anything away without her seeing it first. It's only fair, it's not my stuff. Even when it is my stuff she tends to go through it and rescue shit from the bin.

How the fuck do I do this? I'm trying to do it as gently as possible but nothing is getting through. Do I lay down the law and be a total bitch about all the pointless shit we're holding on to? Every time I mention something all I get is another fucking excuse. I walked around the house and screamed when I saw all the shit that's just been put back.

I removed everything that shouldn't belong in the kitchen and stated that that shit is not to go back in there. I've done this several times and each time it's gone back in. So now we've got kitchen shit everywhere, plus all the fucking shit that shouldn't be in there in the first place.

It's going to get worse for the next 3 weeks since she has an assignment due. I agree she should prioritise this, but this is always used as an excuse to not sort the house out and since she's not there to control anything she won't let me do anything either.

Right now - I have probably over 100 tabs open - it's not always this bad, but it can be, and it doesn't have to be, because it's more than just how many tabs I have open - it's the obsessive, compulsive, and constant/habitual opening of tabs that are extremely more easy to open than close - it's the unfocused, easily distractible (almost ADD-like), overly interested mindset that I have which limits my productivity and time with any given thing/tab, clouds my priorities, further clutters and disorganizes my life and mind, and so forth and so on.

As I was preparing, I came up with a very detailed list of who or what was wrong.

I was frustrated though. I felt it wouldn't convince my intended audience. I was sure:

1. That this problem existed.
2. That I seemed to be the only one who saw this as an underlying theme in many seemingly unrelated problems.

So, I took a walk and started thinking about how I organized a part of my closet yesterday and...I figured it out. 

At work, I wasn't actually trying to say that everyone was wrong and that this problem was huge. Actually, a change had been made, and they didn't realize how far reaching it was, so it wasn't properly communicated.

* Was: A = B
* Now: A = C but a lot of people still thought A = B
* Should be: A = C

O.K. easy enough. I pretty much put that in a presentation and added a list of bugs that had been caused by it. Problem, example, solution. 

So, what does this have to do with decluttering and my clean closet?

**TL;DR start here**

I was so busy thinking ""How do I fix this?"" That I forgot to ask ""Why?""

Yesterday, when I was cleaning a shelf in my closet, I picked up each item and used the [5 Whys Method](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm). For example, a white table runner with blue trim:

1. ""Why is this here?"" Because I use it sometimes.
2. ""Why not more often?"" Because who needs it everyday?  And, I have 3 others, but in case I want vareity it's good to have it.
3. ""Why does this help with vareity?"" Well it's the only thing I have in this shade of blue...hmm already I was doubting its usefulness.
4. ""Why do I only have one thing in this shade of blue?"" Because it is nice looking but actually I don't really care for this color blue.
5. ""Why am I still even thinking about this?"" 

...donation box.

**Your turn:** Take 2 items. 1 that you need and 1 you aren't sure about  and use the  [5 Whys Method](http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm) on it.

I wanted to hear y'alls feed back regarding the following:

We went over to my brother's house over the weekend and his wife has come up with a decluttering system for their 7 year old...

Anytime the kiddo leaves a toy outside of his toy room/forgets it somewhere she is leaving a laminated card with a number on it when she picks up the toy. 

So, say he left a power ranger in the kitchen she takes the toy to their master bedroom and hides it in their cabinets with the matching card (the number 1). When the kiddo finds the card with the number, if he can remember what toy he left there he gets it back. (that's why she has matching number cards so she doesn't have to remember what was left where). If he doesn't remember what toy it was....said toy gets donated to a charity ""because he doesn't care enough about it to remember it"".

I, personally, am not terribly comfortable with this system. As an airhead myself I feel like it would have been very stressful to me and unfair because I have the memory of a gnat. Luckily, my nephew is a chill kiddo (like his dad was) and seems to have accepted her new system without a fuss. My brother's just glad to have the amount of toys in the house being cut down (surprisingly quickly).

For 7 days (almost) nothing new comes into your home. Here's how:

 1. Start by making a list at home of things you need to spend money on or want to buy. Split the items on your list into 3 categories. 
  * **Food Shopping List**: Make a [meal plan for 1 week](http://www.wikihow.com/Meal-Plan). Look through your cupboards, what food do you already have there? Now what ingredients do you need to buy to make complete meals. Only the essential ingredients, or sales items you need to stock up on should be on your food shopping list. Also household essentials like toilet paper belong on this list.
  * **Bill Paying List**: Which bills do you need to pay this week. Make a list. 
  * **Everything Else List**: Put things on a list to research. Go online and look up prices. Decide on color, type, brand, whatever you can chooose. Decide when it comes into your home, where are you going to put it? Will it replace an item you already have? How will you get rid of the item that is going to be replaced? Write this all on the list.  (You can keep adding to this list for the whole week.) 

 2. Limit your shopping trip to only one time during the week. Don't forget your **Food Shopping List**. Only pick up things on your list. If you forgot something, try to make do without it.   

 3. Pay your bills, work on your organizing your finanaces. What can be done automatically? Do you have a system for incoming bills? How do you file your paid bills? 

 4. After 7 days review your **Everything Else List**. Anything, without a price or  a place in your home, should be researched more. Anything that does have a price and a place in your home, can be bought if you still feel you need it.

why you need it or why you don't,     
when you'll need it or that you won't

* Develop organizational skills.
* Feel more secure knowing you have the basics covered.

It's  few years old, but it was inspiring and on-topic for my life at that moment.  

The fridge was one of the first places that I started organizing and applying rules that has kept with me until today. 

**As Corey Mintz puts it**
 
 &gt; Sometimes I can come across as uptight, snobby, callous and inflexible. Which is great because that's how I am in real life. Also I'm punctual. Here's hoping this photo of my fridge's middle shelf (the meats and produce are below) will illustrate these character assets/flaws.  

 * [Link to article](http://www.thestar.com/life/2008/10/02/contents_of_your_fridge_is_a_window_to_your_personality.html)

 * What really comes accross to me is that this guy thinks about organization as part of buying, making and storing food. It's not an afterthought, it's something to think about - a lot - and come up with ways to make it easy to store and find and use.

**Directional organizing: Use gravity as your guide.**

 * The top shelf is for items that will be eaten raw (cheese or cold cuts), 
 * the next shelf is for things that will be slightly warmed or rewarmed (leftovers), 
 * the next shelf is for things that need to be cooked (raw meat). 

This prevents raw meat from dripping onto food that won't be cooked. Most refrigerator allow you to adjust the shelves to different heights. 
[This article pretty much says that along with information about proper temperature](http://www.safefood.eu/Food-safety/Storage/What-goes-where-in-the-fridge.aspx)


**Less stuff means better overview, means less waste.** 

 * Here's a [food storage chart](http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html) listing the length of time food should be stored. If your fridge or freezer is too full, start by getting rid of items that are too old or improperly labelled.

You all voted for Food Clutter to be the topic for the next two weeks.

This includes your fridge, cupboards, pantry, and/or emergency stores.

**Casual**: Pick one, like the one that you have to add to most often but still has staples that haven't budged in ages.

**Normal**: Pick your least used one, or any two.

**Hard**: Pull out all your non-perishables, and then go after your perishables!

***

Some tips:

**Non-perishables/canned foods**: This includes items in your cupboards, pantry and/or emergency stash

Check for expiration/expiry dates and toss expired foods. Also check for bulging that would indicate bacteria being present on cans and bottles with the specially designed lids. For remaining items, separate into Keep and Donate piles. Separate the Keep pile into Use Often and Wish to Use piles. Re-evaluate the Wish to Use. Set aside Donate pile near door for pick-up/drop-off. 

**Perishables**: This includes items in your fridge/freezer

Check expiration/expiry dates and toss anything expired, as well as anything brown, smelly, mushy, or soggy that shouldn't be. Anything you can't remember when you bought it, should probably go. For everything else, [check](http://www.stilltasty.com/) to make sure it's still good, even with a date on it (for instance, meat lasts longer in the freezer than in the fridge under most circumstances).

1371387247.0,18,self.declutter,1gg9v5,Excuses: are they valid?,Oneinfivepeople,22,4,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1gg9v5/excuses_are_they_valid/,"I've been lurking for a while on this subreddit, but took the plunge recently to make an account and get some feedback on my situation with clutter. A lot of the time posts here resonate with me and I have learned some great things from this subreddit community. But my situation is different and seems very difficult to me. I'm starting to wonder how many others have my situation. My excuses are valid to me when I'm feeling low and overwhelmed with the amount of things in my house. At other times when I am getting stuck in and sorting and changing my space at home, the excuses seem very feeble and far away. I have had panic attacks and allergic reactions from dirt, dust, mould and food packaging from ingredients I react to and I can't keep being at this stress level any longer. Comments and advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Excuse 1: I don't live alone. I share with my husband, and three housemates. We rent one large bedroom and one small box-room. The kitchen, hall, lounge and two bathrooms are shared spaces. 

Excuse 2: My mother in law sadly passed away and the entirety of my husbands' belongings from his childhood were moved into our box room when her house was put up for sale. 

Excuse 3: My housemates are all incredibly messy and say that I make them 'feel bad' when I tidy communal spaces. Their belongings in the communal area are a great source of stress to me. I have 'gone on strike' in the past year as I was the only person tidying, but after a few weeks I cannot bear it and begin to tidy again before anybody else begins to help.  

Excuse 4: Not wanting to cause horrible tension in my home by arguing with my housemates. Let me give you one example. After one of my housemates moved in last September, she began leaving things on the end of 'her couch'. By Christmas the pile was so large she couldn't sit on the two-seater any longer and tried to move onto 'my couch' as it was clear. I told her to move her items or I would, as it wasn't fair. She became very vocal and said expressly that I couldn't move her belongings from that space because she paid rent. We ended up compromising by me giving her a box to put the items in, so the couch was cleared. The box went onto the floor next to the couch. After Christmas her belongings built up again, but this time I didn't touch them. When Easter came, I gave her another box and it went next to the first. The same happened again with it building up between Easter and beginning of June when she left for the summer break (she's a student). I was made to feel unreasonable for giving her 3 boxes which are still in my living room now. She isn't returning until September so one will have been there for a year. I'm still afraid she will rant and rave if I move them to her bedroom and my husband says I should just leave them alone if they aren't mine. 

Excuse 5: I work long hours and have a very stressful job. By the time I come back and have shopped for food, cleared space to prep it, emptied the overflowing bin, washed up prep utensils and so on, emptied the recycling outside, done laundry and kept on top of the essential things that I can't do without, decluttering further seems exhausting. 

Excuse 6: My husband had depression and was unemployed for a long time after his mum died. Any talk of asking him to help around the house sent him spiralling away from me as it made him feel 'useless' and was a reminder that he was not contributing in a financial way. He got very upset when things were moved from his system of clutter piled high and he couldn't find something, so I eventually stopped moving/sorting any of his belongings. 

Excuse 7: Scheduling. Hubs now works nights and couldn't be happier to be contributing and working at what he loves. The shifts we do overlap so that on my time off, he is sleeping and thus I can't tidy or declutter or do noisy tasks which might disturb him. In addition, during exam time for the student housemates, the house had to be quiet and I respect their education so I didn't start pulling wardrobes around. Husband still doesn't contribute to cleaning because he believes his full-time job at night and sleeping during the day means he is too busy. The logic of me having had full time work for the last few years seems conveniently forgotten. 

TL;DR I wonder whether my situation is genuinely more difficult than others and if I need to get more serious help, or if I should man up and deal with the excuses.

She also has a 4 month-old son. Let's see what she thinks about decluttering:

Questions:

**What point are you at now? Can you say you're clutter-free?** 

Heck no. I've had problems with clutter since I was a kid. I didn't like getting rid of stuff and was always saying I'd attend to things later. You can imagine what my school locker looked like.

I've been working on changing my habits for years. So you can say that I'm a work-in-progress, solving problem areas a spot at a time.

**What was the turning point that led to you starting to declutter? What inspired you? What makes you want to keep your space clean and clutter-free?**

Clean and uncluttered spaces always made me feel good. I was getting tired of having otherwise beautiful space clogged up with all of my crap. Plus, it was getting harder and stressful to find things. And honestly, I never really looked at some of the stuff I had until I packed for another move.

Now that we have a beautiful new home and a brand new kid, I'm wanting to do whatever I can to keep it looking nice and model good habits. The absolute last thing I want is to find myself on an episode of, ""Hoarders."" My husband is a bit of a minimalist, so that made it easier to adapt some of his behaviors. Little things, like only going shopping when I needed something and keeping digital copies of important documents made a pretty significant impact.

**What was easier to do than you thought? What was harder? What is your biggest frustration or pet peeve when it comes to decluttering?**

When I break things down into small accomplishable goals it's easy. The hardest part is just starting. The next hardest is sticking to it. Once I get going, though, it's addictive. I need to be better about riding that momentum. I am my own biggest frustration. I'm really good at procrastinating. Really, really good.

**Can you tell us about what systems or techniques that you found most useful?**

Starting with small things. Putting things away as soon as possible. Not bringing home things that we don't need. Not keeping things we don't need. Making a designated space for specific things to belong.

My proudest achievement so far is the ""landing strip"" table where we have a dish to collect our stuff as we come in. No more running around searching for keys, the garage door opener, or sunglasses. Before, this stuff ended up either on the dining table, by the computer, or somewhere else in the house. Now, it's all in that one small dish on an otherwise empty table.

Another thing that's helped is having guests over. There's nothing like the thought of someone coming over to make me want our place looking as nice as possible.

**Is there anything about your space that makes it more challenging to be clutter-free (i.e. lack of cupboards/storage? Too much storage?)?**

We had the baby shortly after we moved in, so there's still stuff that doesn't really have a home. Our storage room is small and I'm certain we're not using the space well. There's stuff we're not sure whether to keep or toss/donate. We need to dedicate time to go through it.

The stairs make it a little difficult to take loads of stuff down for donating, so that's beginning to pile up. On the plus side, the stairs make us really mindful of what we bring up. There's a lot of stairs plus a baby. So, anything we haul up or down has to be worth the effort.

**What is your decluttering priority at the moment?**

Keeping the kitchen tidy and finding some sort of solution for our paperwork. Right now, it's all either going in our briefcase, basket, or shred pile. We need something better.

**Any other tips for people just getting started in decluttering?** 

Start with a small space and try to keep it uncluttered for a week. Ask yourself if you really need what you have or if it's just taking up space. Donating is fun and the reclaimed space feels great!

**Has /r/declutter helped you at all? In what way/s?** 

Yes! I love that it's a community of people trying to accomplish the same thing while being supportive of one another. It helps keep me motivated and a little accountable.

**Any other sources that have helped or inspired you (books, tv shows, forums, blogs, etc.)?** 

Books: Organizing from the Inside Out by Julie Morgenstern I've checked this out a bunch of times over the years for inspiration. I haven't yet checked out her new book, SHED Your Stuff, Change Your Life, but it sounds quite fitting for me right now.

Website: UFYH (Unf**k Your Habitat). This site helped me embrace the idea that I could accomplish a little bit every day and not write myself off as a failure. I find it funny, candid, refreshing, and a good source of inspiration.

TV: Hoarders. I so don't ever want to be on that show. I watch it every once in a while to get me going on a day-long cleaning spree. It's like listening to rock music before going on a long run. It gets me all charged up and ready to take on a mess.

My husband and I just relocated halfway across the US for work, and find ourselves in a somewhat smaller apartment than we used to have. Not a big deal, except for the fact that the kitchen is MUCH smaller, like 1/5 of the size. We're down with getting rid of a lot of stuff, but cooking is something that means a lot to us. So no, we don't really need that many cookie sheets, or three different sizes of cast iron skillets and we're paring those things down, but when people question whether we need a dehydrator/pressure cooker/industrial KitchenAid mixer ... we could certainly live without them, but we use them constantly and the process of using them (and eating the results!) brings us a lot of joy. 

As a result, we've decided to kind of annex about a third of the living room to be a kitchen extension, and use a hallway linen closet as a pantry. (Who the hell has so many towels in a one-bedroom apartment that they need a whole closet for them, anyway?) In order to make space, we're ditching a lot of conventional living room stuff. It'll mean limited seating, no dedicated space for our exercise equipment, no more music corner (guitars will be wall mounted, recording equipment will be stored in the bedroom), and halving our book and record collection. Thank goodness we don't own a TV or things would have been a lot more difficult.

In theory, I should never be bored since I have tons of materials for creative/technical ventures: various instruments, yarn for knitting/weaving, painting and drawing supplies, junior electronics kit, gardening books, fabric, etc etc etc. However, most of these objects are currently just reminding me of all the awesome things I *could* be doing but am neglecting instead. I know much of it boils down to my cluttered brain + mental health issues (which I'm getting help for), and all these reminders of ""failure"" are getting me down. I know that I actually will end up using many of these objects, e.g. my instruments and knitting supplies, but I'm just not sure where I should draw the line, cut my losses and donate the stuff. What if, when my moods are more stable, I regret my decision to purge?   

My most pressing issue right now is old tangled scraps of yarn. I can't donate it and I absolutely *hate* throwing things away that could possibly EVER have another use.

You just have to sweep (or vacuum) all* the floors in your house 3 days in a row. 

 * Day 1: This is the hardest day of the challenge. You'll be picking up lots of things. Try and find a better place than the floor for everything you pick up.
 * Day 2: Should be relatively easy. The floors should be clutter free and all you have to do is sweep or vacuum
 * Day 3: If there is anything on your floor on Day 3 you know some system somewhere isn't working. That can be your next project. If there's nothing on your floor on Day 3, then you are doing very well. Make sure to follow through with the third day and sweep or vacuum every floor. It's good for building character.  


****

*If all seems too much, then pick at least one room the first time you do this challenge. After that you can repeat the challenge adding one room at a time.

**Edit: My results** 
 
* **Day1:** Had to pick up a lot of stuff. My 3 decluttered rooms were easy, but the other rooms needed a lot of work to get the floor clean enough to sweep. I ended up putting some random piles of stuff in moving boxes and labeled them each with a date in the next 3 weeks. I will do the work then to sort through those piles and find proper homes for the things I want to keep.
* **Day 2:** I'm on day two now and I just realized I can't put away my f§$%$&amp; shoes. Also I was surprised at how much I was able to sweep up on the second day. Hair, sand and still lots of dust. I am sweeping around the boxes for now, but I am already thinking of what to do with the contents.
* **Day 3:** This challenge now reminds me of the [What can you get done in 10 Minutes](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1c7968/challenge_what_can_you_get_done_in_10_minutes/) Challenge. It now takes me 10 minutes to sweep the whole house. Unbelievable. I'm going to try and keep this up.

She doesn't know the difference between buying something useful and buying it because it was ""on sale."" We end up with WAY more books, furniture, linens, random plastic things &amp; other junk in the house that we don't need, which takes up space and causes clutter, which I believe creates a very tense living space. She over-cooks, which is sometimes not a bad thing, but we end up throwing out half of our refrigerator within a few days, wasting food. She's such a sensitive person so since I've been home, I've been trying to easily help her around the house, asking what she uses and doesn't to dissolve the clutter. She has admitted to feeling cluttered, but is a very lazy person and doesn't do anything. Then, she yells at me and my brother whenever we want to cook for ourselves or whenever I'm organizing and always tells us to ""don't throw anything away before I look at it."" However, I have to throw shit away to declutter, and she's so lazy that I know she won't go through it and not even notice. I understand that people do things in their own time and organizing requires patience, especially when you have help, but it's TOO much time and energy that's being wasted on someone so naive and not appreciative of the little things in life. On a side note, she pays off 5 large storage buildings from a move we made 3 years ago that we have YET to got through so that we can have a peaceful happy family vacation sometime in the [distant] future. I'm going to try to ""hang in here"" living in this mess of a home, trying to keep things straight, but honestly, I'm 24 years old and I don't want to be doing this for the rest of my mom's days. There are times when I tell my siblings that I can't wait for her to pass away so that we can get rid of every piece of junk she's ever bought and sort out the rest. What my mom needs is a stranger to come in and go through every item she owns (like on the show Hoarders). She's not as bad as the people on the show (though we have lived like that before, which was terrifying), but we desperately need some help.

I tried to keep only a small amount of things there, but they always blossomed.

Starting a few days ago, I decided to have exactly one permanent thing on my desk surface. It's a little buddha statue. It reminds me to meditate, and to keep things clear and simple.

###The Desk Surface
----

Here are a couple of pictures of my desk, in use. You can see the buddha, the computer (I was working) and a tea set. 

http://i.imgur.com/3WKVfMlh.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/g8qlpBph.jpg

When I'm not drinking tea, there's no tea set. When I'm not working, the computer goes away to be charged in another section of the room. Keeping the charger elsewhere encourages me not to leave the computer on the desk.

###Drawers
----

Now, you might think this system isn't sustainable. What if I want to write something down, or scan things? 

Well, I thought of that. The real secret to this system was cleaning my drawers. That let me put only the things I need for easy access in the drawers. 

When I need something, I get it out of the drawer, use it, and put it back when I'm done.

**Main drawer:** Pens, ipad stylus, letter opener, vitamine E cream (I have a scar I need to apply it to), a few documents.

http://i.imgur.com/Fvinohch.jpg

The documents are not in heavy use, but that's the best place to store the at present.

**Bottom drawer:** Paper, pen refills

http://i.imgur.com/juhHbz5h.jpg

**Middle Drawer:** Passport and ID cards, envelopes and stamps, camera battery, scanner

http://i.imgur.com/8aiDhbhh.jpg

The scanner, a Fujitsu scansnap, is amazing. I used it to get rid of almost all my paper. But it's clunky to have on my desk or a shelf. So I wrap it up and put it away when I don't need it. Takes 15 seconds to set it up.

**Top Drawer:** Camera, headset, post-its, iphone cable, flashlight, tape measure, glasses case and cleaner, iPad

http://i.imgur.com/BsIJb6oh.jpg

The iPad isn't there, but normally goes in this drawer. I use it for teaching online lessons, otherwise not at all.

###Inboxes and Keeping Clean
----

**Not Shown: Inboxes**

I have three inboxes on top of bookshelves. One for things to scan, one for things to process, one for things to take out of the house. They let me keep paper and other things off my desk.

**Keeping it Clean**

Only the buddha stays. This clear rule makes it easy to keep stuff off. I don't have to debate with myself. There are no exceptions. Nothing should stay on the desk surface in permanence. 

A general decluttering tip I've found extremely helpful is never to get up or leave the room with your hands empty. Meaning, if you are changing rooms and see something out of place, put it in place. 

Practice this regularly, and you'll nip clutter in the bud.

I’ve done a lot of the more obvious decluttering. I still find things I need to get rid of and there are still layers, but those layers are getting thinner and thinner. Lately, I’ve been focusing on decluttering in some less obvious ways. One thing in particular I’ve been focusing on is decluttering my time: About six months ago, I realized I was the more stressed out and unhealthy I had ever been in my life. “But I’m in college, aren’t I having so much fun?” I asked myself. I hung out with one group of friends on Mondays, went to this club meeting on Tuesdays, that club meeting Wednesdays, volunteering on Thursdays, etc. When I really stopped to think about it, most of the things I was doing weren't making me happy. They were cluttering up my time. I was doing them because perhaps they had made me happy at some point, but weren’t anymore or I didn’t want to let someone down, or it was going to look so good on my resume--basically all terrible excuses.  I’ve since stopped doing almost all of those things. I try to only spend my time doing things that truly bring me joy or enrich me in some way. 

As a side note, even if its something you’re getting paid to do, no one can ever pay you what your time is worth. Having time to spend doing things you want to do, or seeing people you want to see or learning to play the violin like you’ve been meaning to for years, is something that no amount of money is worth giving up. Money comes and goes, but those moments laughing at the park with your significant other or digging for fossils in your backyard with your kid are moments you can never get back. 

**Any other tips for people just getting started in decluttering?**


1.	It's not a competition. If you, like me, also subscribe to /r/minimalism, you see posts that are like ""Me &amp; My 100 Possessions"" and then it's like some smug-looking mid-thirties guy sitting in some trendy looking empty apartment with his two shirt and one pair of pants, etc. In my opinion, that's just silly and impractical. If you’re shooting for some number of items, you’re most likely doing it for the wrong reasons. It’s not about how much clutter you have compared to everyone else, but getting to a point that you’re happy with. Everyone has different needs, comforts, etc. Some people have kids, or hobbies, or disabilities, etc. There is some stuff that is good to have. If you like to play guitar, don’t get rid of your guitar just so you have less stuff. 

2.	Not only does more money and more stuff not make you happy--it oftentimes makes you less happy because it means you are looking in all the wrong places for happiness and fulfillment. It's people and love and friendship and experiences and learning new things and finding out what you're good at and doing that thing, that makes you happy.  Many corporations want you to think that the product or service they're trying to sell you is going to make you happier, but they lie. Consider Swiss Miss brand hot chocolate’s  slogan: ""Share a moment.""  The marketing team at Swiss Miss wants you to think that it’s their hot chocolate that made that winter night around the fire with your family so special-- in fact, the beverage at hand was probably the least special thing about that night. Similarly, consider Coca-Cola's slogan ""open happiness.""  What you're really opening is a can full of sugary crap, when you could be drinking cool crisp delicious water for free and your body and wallet would be better off for it. When you're at a clothing store and you try on a shirt and it just fantastic on you. “Would I wear it?” you ask yourself. It looks good on you and you would wear it, so you decide to buy it. I'm not saying don't buy it, but I am saying don't buy it and expect it to increase your net happiness. Think of all the shirts you've bought in your lifetime. Aside from that initial rush you may get that first night you step out on the town in your new garb, has any one of those purchases really increases your overall happiness? I'm doubtful.

3.	Using human-powered transportation is pretty much the best thing ever. When I started walking and/or biking to the grocery store, the amount I was spending on food dropped by probably 50% and my refrigerator and pantry quickly started to clear out. When you have to carry everything home, you’re less impulsive and buying things that only provide empty calories and contain no real nutrition like sodas, etc. seems a lot less appealing. Aside from helping reduce the clutter in your kitchen, other benefits of using human-powered transportation:
a.	It’s good for you. You burn fat and gain muscle.
b.	It’s good for the environment: It runs on that lasagna you ate earlier instead of fossil fuels.
c.	It’s good for your wallet.
d.	It’s good for the environment. 
Who knows you may even decide you don’t need that second car or even a car at all!

4.	Something nice about decluttering is as you do it, you'll probably mostly give away the things, you don't need, but you'll find you probably have more idle assets sitting around waiting to be liquidated than you originally thought. The more you do it, the more you’ll start to notice a little more cash in your bank account at the end of every month. Some examples from my own experience: 

a.	I bet you never thought of your microwave as an idle asset. I no longer have a microwave and I absolutely love it. I realized that a microwave was just an unnecessary tool to make food preparation more convenient. As I stated above, I don’t think a more convenient life is a better life. My food tastes better because I have to take the time to cook something and I eat healthier foods. If you have a microwave and then realize you don't need it, that's $30 in your pocket from someone on Craigslist. As you declutter and realize more and more things you neither want nor need, you’ll get more and more little cash infusions into your bank account. For me, it added up to be quite a bit.

b.	As  I mentioned, since I’ve been working on decluttering other areas of my life than just the more obvious closet, attic etc, I’ve also stopped getting internet in my apartment. It sounds kind of drastic, but after I moved to a new place and while I was waiting for everything to get set up, I realized how nice it was to not have internet. I suddenly had much more time on my hands and was doing things I “hadn’t had time for” before like reading, going for longer walks, starting an herb garden, etc. In addition, my productivity has skyrocketed because instead of DRAGGING OUT everything I need to do and wasting fat chunks of time on Reddit or FaceBook as I worked, when there is something I need to do, I walk over to a coffee shop on my street or my University’s library and do what I need to do then leave.  I love the internet just as much as the next guy, but I don’t miss it at all. Additionally, I am saving a good chunk of money every month.

c.	I also don’t own a TV nor do I get cable. I didn’t grow up with TV so this wasn’t something I started doing in an effort to declutter, but I think it is something that a lot of people would be better off without. What if instead of having a living room centered around your TV/entertainment center, you cleared up that space and had a living room centered around the scrabble board with your family or whatever you like doing.  Most of the stuff on TV seems like garbage to me anyways. If I want to watch a movie, my laptop does the job just fine.



**Has /r/declutter helped you at all?**


By the time I found /r/declutter, I had already done a lot of decluttering. /r/declutter has helped me though, because I read other people’s posts and often through the process of thinking about my own experiences and writing them out, I’ve learned a lot about a lot of things including myself. Since I seem to have a lot to say on the topic, I’m actually working on starting a blog based on some of the things I write here! :) I’ll make a post when I feel it’s at a point worthy of sharing. 



**Any other sources that have helped or inspired you (books, tv shows, forums, blogs, etc.)?**


•	Mr. Money Mustache: This is my favorite blog on the internet. He takes pretty much my life philosophy and puts it in words in a clever, witty, insightful, enlightening way. If you haven’t already checked out this blog, you should.

•	/r/minimalism has some pretty good stuff

•	/r/buyitforlife to a degree, although be careful because it’s easy to get sucked into all the sudden “needing” things that you had never before even thought about. I agree with the concept of spending more on fewer quality items rather than buying many cheap things that are never really what you want. Also I like things that are well made rather than disposable or cheap. 

•	/r/tinyhouses This subreddit will give you some perspective!



**Any other questions that we should have asked/you want to answer? Any other background info. about you that would be helpful? For example, would you consider yourself a hoarder or former hoarder? Were your parents hoarders? Were they extreme minimalists and that either inspired you to be clutter-free or caused you to take on clutter?**


My parents weren’t hoarders at all. They were pretty neat and we never had EXCESS  stuff.  I did come from an upper middle class family though so much of the stuff they own seems pretty unnecessary to me now looking back. We have a lot of crap in the basement that hasn’t been touched in years, a ping pong table that no one ever uses, the “fancy” dishes that are too fancy to actually use, and hodgepodge of bicycles and bicycle parts from when my sister and I were younger that no one ever uses, sports equipment “just in case” anyone feels like going out in the backyard and playing ball which of course no one ever does. 


I can’t think of any questions that should have been asked at the moment, but if anyone has any, feel free to ask them in the comments and I’ll get back to you!

It made me smile because I've had that feeling so many times since I started decluttering. Most recently it was a large white serving platter that I found under the free-standing clothes closet that was so covered in dust that I first thought ""What is this grey plate?"". I've since put it in a more accessible place, and it's in my regular rotation and has been used often.

So what have you hidden from yourself? What surprises have you found?

Not for lack of trying, but for lack of plan.

It finally dawned on me that even if everything fits in the room, as soon as one thing was in the way, I couldn't reach any of it. 

I had to imagine past the furtniture to come up with a plan. It's so hard to get a decent picture of that room, so I drew a blue print and added some shots to it. 

Without furhter ado [Before + Plan](http://imgur.com/a/f6A4X)

**The hardest decision?**

 * That big white table. I love it, but it is too big and doesn't fit. We will move it out soon. I might be able to put it in another room, but I have to wait until I know what to do with the other things first. 
 * The only thing on that table that I didn't have elsewhere was my sewing machine. So I decided to downsize. I took a desk out of the bedroom. I had to empty out the drawers and clear some clutter from the top, but I realized it too had also become a place for clutter to collect.

**Put like with like**

* This advice isn't just for objects but for systems too. Now I have all clothes themed systems on one side of the room and the other stations won't be blocked by them anymore.

I still have to sort through many boxes, but now I have a much better idea of what I need and where to put it. 

I'll be working on this over the next 2 weeks and will update again soon.

I have a bunch of old t-shirts, from concerts and trips, that I sometimes still wear.  The only thing is, I don't want to wear them out because I want to make a t-shirt quilt out of them. Now, before you say ""get rid of them, you'll probably never do it"", I WILL. I just made one for my Dad (completed and everything) and he loves it.  I don't want mine to be as big as the one I made my Dad (queen size), but I don't have enough t-shirts yet. Can anyone think of a way to store them until I have enough to make it and time to make it and money (they are expensive to make them, doing it the right way).  I had some of them in a space bad under my bed at my moms house, but I recently moved (temporarily) and my sister has my bed, so when I come to visit I sleep on an air mattress in my old room.  I'm working to declutter and minimalize, but it's hard when I'm only there on the weekends.

First of all, I am someone who naturally has gravitated towards the past.  I like history, things that were in history, someone who has oftentimes dwelled personally too much on my past and not the future.

I save receipts from vacations or dates.  I often feel that it is a confirmation that what I think occurred really did.  I've got clothes, knick knacks, truly practical things, papers, books, etc.  A good amount of it is stored in my old bedroom at my parents house, which is of no bother to them.

I've also got some similar items at my current place....except a lot of these things are more practical.  The medicine cabinet has what ifs and no sense in having to buy it again laters.  I've got driver discs to things I don't even know if I have anymore.  I do photography as a day job and have pretty much an entire room filled with nothing but what ifs and no sense in buying it agains.  I rarely use that stuff...invaluable when I need it, but 364 days a year it sits there.  I could honestly pay a good chunk of my bills by getting rid of about half of it...but...I could use it.  

I just rent this place currently, so a lot of it is boxed up or on shelves.  I don't see any reason in bringing a lot of it out if it isn't it's permanent home.  If things work out, I'd like to try and move into a real house in the next couple years.  

I feel I have a family history on my moms side of minor hoarding.  My great grandmother went to auctions and brought thing after thing home.  It was never like you see on the shows, you could move around and was definitely sanitary.  My mom tends to just fill up her house with things.  Nothing of it really particuarly valuable, but I think she feels like it is worth something.  Again, clean house in all aspects, just stuff.  A lot of hers isn't historic, just stuff.  Mine is either practical or related to a memory.  It is either potentially useful or just to emotionally involved to get rid of.

I wanted to make sure that I packed anything I could possibly want or need, so I made a few trips from my parent's house to my dorm throughout the school year to pick up things I've held onto for various reasons. However, due to various reasons, my parents didn't move until this summer and during my numerous visits to and from the dorm, I've managed to become a packrat....

While my dorm has been reasonably organized because I learned how to stash everything I own in a variety of ways. Now that I have to pack up and move by myself in one (or two trips), I am seriously stressing out. I just own so many things I don't even use, but at the same time I am too nervous to get rid of anything. The main culprit at the moment is clothes. I only wear about 20% of the clothes I own. I've been holding onto most of it because I thought I could possibly hand them down to my younger cousin. However, like any typical thirteen year old girl, she does not want any of my hand-me-downs. I tried taking some of my clothes to Platos Closet before, but they only took a few items because my clothes ""weren't in season"".

I also have a laundry basket filled with collectable Disney stuffed animals that I will not get rid of due to sentimental reasons, along with Disney tea cups and mugs.

TL;DR: I just have so many things and no idea how to tackle getting rid of a lot of before I move (most of these items being clothes). What can I do to declutter before I move? Are there any blogs/websites that have ideas on decluttering items?

I was out of town for the last four days visiting family and we stayed in a 300 year old mountain house. Much of the furniture is around 200 years old. Big free standing cabinets, chairs, tables all made out of wood.

I asked how it got into the house in the first place and they told me there used to be only two foot paths until about 40 years ago and everything had to be carried up there. Or they made it themselves.

Things have changed, now it is easy to reach with a car in the warmer months. But still there is no garbage pick-up. So any waste has to be transported in the car back to the closest village and you have to pay for disposal.

A little about myself, I'm a single early 30's male who just finished grad school and have continued the ongoing process of decluttering my life that started when I came out to the Midwest for grad school.  

Now I am much more serious about decluttering and have been very diligent.  I have set the goal for myself to be able to fit everything material I need into my car by the time the assignment for my new job is up (10 months) because at this point I will have to move again (across country).

My question is a very basic one.  During the initial stages of serious decluttering, how do you get over the anxiety/frustration about what seems like a lack progress?  For example, I am embarrassed to admit that I had over 50 pairs of shoes, and even though I have cut this number in half, the realization today that I still have 25 pairs of shoes made me scream in frustration.

Good question, Joeyjojojunior1794!

That's an issue I've been facing with finding good articles for this subreddit.  I can either look for information on cleaning and organizing a house and I get loads of pinteresty, ""housewife"", mommy bloggers vocabulary with terms like ""get it done"", ""make it work"", ""launch pad"" with maybe a nugget of good advice and a bunch of pretty pictures.  Everyone comes up with their own way to describe things.

Where I've had more luck finding useful terminology is looking at project management, cog sci and other organizational sciences to help find theories and studies on how to consider things and what to do. 

I compare:

* Decluttering tasks to project management.
* Optimizing and Maintenance to system management.
* Family members and roommates to organizational management.

**...what is the official terms for reorganizing/optimizing an area...**

**A [system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System):**

&gt;Some systems share common characteristics, including:[citation needed]

 * A system has [structure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure), it contains parts (or components) that are directly or indirectly related to each other;
 * A system has [behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior), it contains processes that transform inputs into outputs (material, energy or data);
 * A system has [interconnectivity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interconnectivity): the parts and processes are connected by structural and/or behavioral relationships.
 * A system's structure and behavior may be decomposed via subsystems and sub-processes to elementary parts and process steps.

&gt;The term system may also refer to a set of rules that governs structure and/or behavior. Alternatively, and usually in the context of complex social systems, the term institution is used to describe the set of rules that govern structure and/or behavior.

As you can see I've linked to the top article on systems and from there you can find loads of helpful vocabulary that will help you evaluate each area you mention. 

**So declutters, what official terms do you know from other areas that could help with organization and optimizing?**

Also yesterday, I put away some of my current project stuff and that took another 2 hours. They have a 2-year old; some of the cleaning is just to get it toddler safe.

 * 1 Hour - The places I've decluttered and organized, were easy. I just had to dust and wash the floors.
 * 3 Hours - The places I have already decluttered took less time to put things away. But I realized the organization isn't there or isn't working. These go on my  to-do list.
 * 5 Hours - Oh, the places that I haven't decluttered yet...they make me sad. However, I did pack 2 bags to donate already (old clothes, a lamp, books and 4 pairs of unused reading glasses) and I have one bag of recycables (paper and cardboard mostly)

So my grand total is 9 hours of cleaning. And if I continue to declutter, I should be able to clean my whole place (I'm talking toddler-clean) in about 3 hours. 

How long does it take you?

**Edit:** I had a great time and it was wonderful to see my friends. The 2 year old wasn't here for more than 5 minutes before she started licking the table. I cleaned for a total of 13 hours, and that included decluttering two areas. I'm happy and am enjoying my freshly cleaned, orderly house.

Pack all your clothes that you want to take into your bag. When you arrive at your new place, don't jump straight into unpacking, leave them in your suitcase in the corner of your room*. When you need a piece of clothing, get it out, wear it, wash it and put it away in your cupboard. In a months time, what is still in your suitcase, throw it away! Edit - to charity of course :)

*if you can't handle a suitcase unpacked in the corner of your room due to space restrictions or neat-freakedness then go right ahead and unpack, but in your hanging section keep used things to the left, and unused to the right. Separate with an empty hanger with a piece of paper taped to it.

Was being held captive with a bunch of other people inside a room. McGyver, who was in it too (LOL), had a plan. We make a hole on the ceiling, escape through it, then set everything on fire to conceal the method used to escape. 

We set fire to a table, in order to give time to escape before it spread. Everybody was gone and there I was, alone, collecting my stuff. Clothes, documents, lots of useless stuff. The fire was getting closer. I needed to speed up, and decided not to collect everything, letting the least important things out. Then I realized I couldn't escape with all the things I had got, only a backpack at max. But everything was disorganized, spread out on the floor (just like my room is now), It just wouldn't be possible to search for everything that was important. I had two options, to escape carrying nothing, or to die.

That was my wake up call. What if MY room was on fire right now? I would have to escape carrying nothing. The car keys are in a place, IDs in another, cellphones in another... There will be not enough time to find even this super-important stuff.

So, I will start organizing myself, and try to remember of the fire.

The sidebar currently holds a description of the what content we want and a bi-weekly clutter challenge from 4 months ago.

Challenges can still be held, but instead of weekly or biweekly (ain't nobody got time for that), we can have them whenever someone has a good idea.

Today is the day to fight entropy! That's right declutters, entropy. I'm using thermodynamics here to explain the natural priniciple of clutter.

Things will disperse themselves so that there is an optimal amount of space between them. [Here's a nice illustration of what I mean.](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Entropie.png) Or just think of a two-year old's room after playing with blocks. 

So you know that clutter you are dealing with, papers, toys, books, articles of clothing, and so on, well it wants to disperse. 

So I have two ways to deal with this:

**Everything has its place and one place for each thing.**

 * Ideally I know where each thing belongs. When it is not being used it is in that place. When it is being used that place stays empty waiting for it. 
 * One place for each item means that I only have one place to find it, one place to look for it, one place to put it back, one place to tell other people where it is and where to put it back. That means I no longer have scissors in every drawer in the house. I have one drawer with scissors in it. ""Oh,"" I said, ""but it is so useful to have my scissors right there whenever I think of scissors."" However it was seldom the case, scissors migrated (entropy) and soon I had 3 scissors in one drawer and none in the other. 


**If you can't find it you can't use it.**

 * It's great having backups, extras, and materials around to use if you need them... I think it is in the box there, no, then try the closet, no then try the other drawer, hmmm it's here somewhere. 
 * You can keep anything as long as it is in its place and is labelled. 


**Things to merge:**

 *  I'll fill this in as people leave comments about what they have been doing. 

**What about you?**

 * Look around the room, in a drawer, in a closet -- what can you merge?
 * Ask questions about the best way to store something
 * Please post any merging sucesses/disappointments in the comments.  (You don't have to have done it on a Monday.)
 * Links to articles about merging, corraling

-Getting rid of excess cookware was surprisingly painless. Looking at a round cake pan and realizing that there's nothing f***ing wrong with a square cake? IN THE BOX. What's the point of a slow cooker when the pressure cooker works better in a tenth of the time? IN THE BOX. Have I EVER served two salads at once?

-Some stuff was surprisingly hard to get rid of. Shoes that were favorites of mine when I lived up north, but won't get much wear now that we've relocated to Texas.

A wooden doll my grandfather bought me for a dollar at a garage sale when he was still alive. That sort of thing.

I just read an article about parents setting up a system for their kids. 

From the article*:

&gt;Here are 5 tips to get you started with the systems:

&gt;1. Label everything that you can label. Label clothes shelves, toy bins, bookshelves, and the inside of drawers. Anything you can stick a label on, do it! You can also use pictures.

&gt;2. Keep like items together and categorized. The easier the system, the easier it will be for the children to maintain.

&gt;3. Have a home for everything they own.

&gt;4. You can include them in the process or not. This is your preference. Most homes we have been in, the children are not there. If the children are teenagers, it's a good idea to have them there.

&gt;5. Once you have the systems in place, talk with your children about the systems and the process of what is going to happen going forward with their space.

Whatever your current situation is, which of these points sound helpful, which of them wouldn't work for you?

 * I then put the basket next to the door and put away everything in that room that belongs there.
 * Then when I leave the room, I put the basket in another room. If I don't have time, it serves as a marker for where to start up again later.

I believe the cables are the most manageable. I've seen many great ideas about using split looms, velcro ties, tape, etc.. to hide the cables. The first thing I did was go out and purchase a decent logitech wireless desktop set. 2 cords down.. many to go. 

The textbooks are the hardest thing for me to get rid of but having limited space, a bin full of them really bugs me. I keep them because I think maybe it would be good to fall back on them one day. Like an accounting formula or specific letter format, who knows!

The sentimental items are a bit of a challenge because I feel an attachment to the physical object but I'm sure it's more the memory. I'm going to start taking pictures of cards, letters, etc and making backups of them digitally. 

I think my post offers a couple ideas to others but at the same time looking for suggestions from this fresh community!

But today I had a great idea, of using the microwave timer as a race!

Threw an edamame bag in for 3 minutes, and used that time to quickly load the dishwasher, transfer rinsed recyclables to the bin, and rinse some more dirty recyclables.

Food wasn't quite ready, so I put it on for another 2 minutes and refolded &amp; organized the dishtowels/rags (housemates just throw them in there when clean, I like to keep like with like so I don't have to dig for a particular cloth), and washed 1 non-dishwasher dish. 

Microwave beeped, transferred the food to a bowl, seasoned, and it was really steamy so I finished up the last couple dishes. When I was tossing the edamame bag, I noticed a fruit fly so I went ahead and took the garbage to the bin, too.

So if you are having a difficult time carving out space to clean the kitchen, or just staying on top of things in the kitchen, use your down time to race and see what you can do in small chunks of time. Waiting for coffee to brew, reheating pizza in the micro, running water in the sink for dishes...don't pull out your smartphone, don't run to watch tv, don't stare off aimlessly.

When I see these cleaned out closets I feel like people have reduced themselves to a couple pairs of pants, a handful of shirts, it just seems so minimal.  When I try culling clothes I've got my categories like Decent (as close to pristine as my clothes get), Knocking Around the House (things I won't wear publicly), Funeral/Interview, Work (welding clothes) Sleep (PJ pants, tanks tops), Warm (sweaters, fleece).

How many decent shirts/pants/skirts would anyone here consider normal? And then how about the knock about pants that can get stained? And on through my categories...

One thing I am prepared to hear is if something isn't good enough to be given away it's not good enough for me.  This is a relatively new idea for me to really feel.  I'm probably on the clutter spectrum of a person who wants to keep things just in case, being fairly close to poverty, with an idea in the back of my mind that the shit is going to hit the fan someday and I want to have supplies.

So where was I? I was on holiday for 2 weeks - which due to bad weather I spent decluttering the family's beach apartment. More on that later. In the past week, I used my momentum from my holiday to work on some less glamorous projects here (fine sorting some boxes of crap) and keeping up my daily routine. I'm proud to report, I've been keeping up the [3 day-sweep challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1e0mp6/challenge_3_day_sweep_or_vacuum/) for over a month now. I've been keeping stuff off the floor and reviewing what needs to be done each day. I hated sweeping before but now it is so normal to do it that it is not so bad anymore.

I hope all you declutters are doing well and taking it one step at a time.

The consensus is ""Well if we need to move it's better to have the original boxes"". Should I just go along with that mentality and use these random cardboard(ish) boxes for storage? Is it better to get rid of them than to have them sit around for a someday move? We don't plan on moving anytime in the next 2-3 years..

Today is the day to sell items that you don't want, but you think are still worth some of the money you paid for them.

I find selling to be one of the hardest decluttering tasks, because I go into it thinking ""this is valuable, it's worth lots of money"" and have been faced with the reality that I can't give it away. 

Selling secondhand things is a learning process. So let's use this thread to talk about where and when you have had success selling what type of things.

Some things that have helped me:
 
 * **Think of the value of your space.** I use real estate prices to help me with this. For example, an apartment in the city center costs 3000€/square meter. A dresser that takes up half a square meter of room is using 1500€ of space just to stand there. It better be doing a good job of being a dresser for that price. 

 * **Most things depreciate in value immediately after leaving the store.** And you now have the work of making it look good without a marketing budget. [How to find the sale value of an item.](http://www.ehow.com/how_5676678_determine-sale-value-used-goods.html)

 * **[Sunk Costs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs)** It is still hard for me to come to terms with this. One positive side of it, is that I have become a better shopper. It's learning about the market value of items that really helped me finally say goodbye to things that are not worth as much as I thought they were. 


**Things to sell and where to sell them:**

 * **Any item:**
  * [garage/yard sale](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/06/12/a-yard-sale-checklist-ten-tips-for-garage-sale-prep/)
  * [ebay](http://www.squidoo.com/ebay-selling-advice)  
  * [craigslist](http://www.moneycrashers.com/craigslist-selling-tips/) : [Great tips by /u/ZombieAcademy](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/194r1f/sell_it_sunday_daily_decluttering_theme/c99t1hg?context=3)
 
 * **Used Books:**   
  * [US site bookscouter](http://bookscouter.com/) (disclaimer: I never tried this one. I just googled it. Please suggest other ones for the US or other countries in the comments) 

 * **Used Clothes:**
  * Find a local consignement shop. You usually need to call to make an appointment. Brand names usually resell the best.
  * On ebay you can sell clothes bundles. When my child outgrew clothes, I just took a group picture, put them all in a box and sold it as one item. I would have gone crazy selling 32 seperate items. 

**What about you?**

 * What do you sell? How do you sell it? Where do you sell it?
 * Ask questions about selling items.
 * Please post any selling sucesses/disappointments in the comments.  (You don't have to have done it on a Sunday.)
 * Links to articles about selling

We are slowly decluttering and ""books"" is always a question.

She then wanted an e-reader, but was afraid it was no good. So I just got with her to the store, showed her the opinions and told her we would sell it on ebay, if she didn't liked it.

But she really liked it. For it is not so heavy (like taking 4 or 5 books to vacation) and nobody can see *what* she is reading ;-) (Susan Elizabeth Phillips and stuff).

She admitted, that she won't read the books standing in the shelf (about 70 altogether) anymore, but wants to keep them.

Okay, now I had ordered her a SD-Card for her mobile, because it just had a Gigabyte of storage and asked, if she needs another card for her e-reader (it has 4 Gigabyte). The answer war: ""No thanks, I just delete books I have read, I won't read them anymore"".

This week, I've been unpacking all the things we packed before listing our house for sale and am now re-sorting through them from scratch and re-packing. Why am I doing this? Well, my family is downsizing from a large house to a small condo and I have to comb through each item I own and ask myself if it's worth keeping and if I have room for it in my 9 x 10 bedroom or my very small section of our very tiny storage locker. 

It wasn't difficult at first because I had so much STUFF but now I'm at the point where it is much more difficult, as I'm giving away 90% of my books and a bunch of favourite tchochkes from trips around the world and gifts from family members.

 * Today is the day to revisit an area you decluttered recently. Is it just as you left it or is the clutter starting to creep back in? Go clean the area. Wipe down the surface and all objects. Remove (weed out) the new items that showed up.

 * Or take a look at the floor in the room you are in. Pick up everything off the floor and sweep or vaccuum. Put as many things away as you can. 

 * Take a large basket and walk through your house. Look around you and put away anything that has a place to be put away but is not in its spot. If it has migrated to the wrong room, put it the basket. When you go to a new room take out all the things that belong in that room and put in things that don't belong in the new room. I walk around my house saying to things, ""You don't belong here"". This is good time to think of things to do on [MERGE IT Monday](http://redd.it/196mu9)
 
 * Pick a visible surface in your house, like a coffee table or dresser top. Remove all object from it. Clean it. Now only put back the things you need. What's left over? Anything there that you enjoy? Put that back on. All the rest of the stuff needs to find a new place or [TAKE IT OUT](http://redd.it/19a078) next Tuesday

 * Do you have a pile of stuff you don't need, and you'd like to sell it? Then today take your cleaning supplies, camera, tape measurer, something to write with, and if you plan to ship it a box it fits in. Clean it up as much as possible, write down what it is and its measurments and take a picture. Pack it up and label the box. (Don't seal it yet, in case you need to look at it again) On [SELL IT Sunday](http://redd.it/194r1f), all you have to do is type it up and upload the picture. 

 * Open your clothes closet. [Follow these instructions](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/10vo7r/we_rfrugal_week_14_frugal_fashion/c6hg1dt)

You've decluttered and you made your space more livable. Good Work! Half the battle is done.

You merged items on MERGE IT Monday and found that you don't need 20 old socks with holes in them. You went through a box on STORE IT Saturday, where you found a collection of old pens or markers or clothes you put away because you never wear them and you still don't want to.

So now, here's the other half of the battle - get it out of the house.

But where? If you are like me then throwing a perfectly good item into the trashcan will make you feel naseuous. So I avoid the trash as much as possible. Here is what I do:

**Where to TAKE OUT your stuff to (In order of preference):**
 
 * **These are the People in Your Neighborhood** - Always call ahead and ask if they need an item that you have. If they don't, ask what they would want, perhaps you'll come accross it later.
   * Schools, recreation centers, libraries, hospitals will want your old button-down shirts (to make smocks out of), old books, old board games, old toys, cds, dvds, video games, supplies for arts and crafts.
   * Women's shelters, homeless shelters, or drug outreach programs will want household items, clothes, toiletries.
   * Animal shelters will want your old towels and sheets.
   * Some organizations do recycling drives. They collect small amounts of scrap metal and then bring it in for money. 

 * **Charitable Organizations:** Here's a few links to the well known places to donate. Oh and when you call they often come to pick it up, you don't even have to take it out yourself.
   * [Goodwill](http://www.goodwill.org/)
   * [Donate Household Appliances](http://www.geappliances.com/service_and_support/donation.htm)
   * [Habitat REStores](http://www.habitat.org/getinv/materials_donations.aspx)
   * [Platelets](http://www.redcrossblood.org/) - The Red Cross doesn't accept small quantities of household goods donations. But you can sell items on their ebay site [Giving Works](http://givingworks.ebay.com/)
   * [Oxfam](http://www.oxfam.org/)
   * [An article listing more places including verterans and soliders](http://www.missminimalist.com/2011/04/where-to-donate-your-stuff-101-places-your-clutter-can-do-good/)
   * ~~The Salvation Army~~ *[Read why this is crossed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/19a078/take_it_out_tuesday_daily_decluttering_theme/c8r5qy9)*

 * **Recycle:** 
   * I'll be happy to list links here or advice about certain items. Basically what I do is look on my town's website or google the item and recycle or disposal. 

**What about you?**

 * How do you get rid of stuff?  
 * Non-US redditors: What about in your country? Where are the best places to donate to?
 * Ask questions about items you'd like to get rid of?
 * Add ideas for donations.
 * Please post any donation related sucesses in the comments. Show us a picture. (You don't have to have done it on a Tuesday.)
 * Links to articles about donation or other posts.

I want to start by saying thanks, as this sub has been an inspiration for me to really minimize my possessions. I've browsed around a bit, but haven't quite found the kind of plan I'm looking for.

What I'm looking for: a specific step by step, task-oriented decluttering process as well as recommendations for how many items you should own within certain categories (pots/pans, shirts, etc.)

A big issue that I'm having in this process is that I am a multi-instrumentalist and a seamstress/craft enthusiast. So, I have 3 instruments as well as 3 boxes of art supplies and a sewing machine. I realize that decluttering is much about getting rid of things you don't need and that I don't really *need* any of this stuff, but they are my hobbies and they make me happy so I don't want to get rid of the stuff either. Any advice on this would be so so appreciated!

At first, curiosity helped me a lot, since I'm currently pursuing a grad school. Wandering around helped me in finding relevant literature for my research. It also pointed me to keep looking for newness and rigor in my research work. Curiosity and oceanic sense of wonder seems like a perfect combination at that time.

But nowadays, I must admit that I find it difficult to control my curiosity and to keep focus on what is important in my current life. Everything suddenly add up and become too much. I feel overwhelmed, panic, stressful, and usually end up doing and accomplish nothing. When my mind wanders around, my overall performance suffers a lot.

When I'm searching for an academic article, for example, I end up with 50+ articles and usually don't have time to read (or even skim) all of them. I probably only need 2 or 3 articles, but I don't know how to resist the temptation of downloading more and more articles. (The same goes with mp3, books, magazines, movies, etc.)

Every night I lay down, my mind starts wandering around to tons of different things and it keeps me awake. Every time I online, my browser opened more than 20 tabs at the same time. It seriously drives me crazy.

Sometimes I feel like I just want to throw away the stuff I owned and format my 1 TB external HDD (that full of stuff). I have a guitar that I bought 2 years ago but only being played 5 times or so. I have a lot of books and novels that I never finished reading. I have a couple of clothes that I bought but never used.

Here is my priority for 2013:
(1) finish my thesis, and get a degree
(2) writing a fiction
(3) regain physical health
(4) marry my girlfriend, am I asking too much here?

but is there anything else to keep in mind? the last 2 times i moved i seem to have made a huge mess right after everything was ""set up"" and then kind of just push the clutter into a non-visible place and it just sat there.   

not as bad as my previous roommate who essentially littered the living room with his unpacked boxes and just lived out of them, but it would still be nice to get some info from people who've had good experiences after their move.  

an example would be like have a trashbag with you as you unpack and put trash into it right away

**Attachment Issues...**

Yes, I am overly attached to many of the items I own. 

 * Costly Purchases: Now it's an ugly, threadbare blanket. I was just starting out on my own and just moved to a new town for a new job. I spent almost all my money on the deposit for my unfurnished room. It would be two weeks before my first paycheck. I piled up my clothes on the floor as a bed, at a Walmart like store I bought food for the next days, I saw the blanket. I was cold, scared and alone in a new city. I put back some of the food and bought the blanket. With my funds so low it was one of the most costly purchases I ever made.

 * Sentimental Stuff: A cheap carnival toy won by an ex-ex-ex-boyfriend in the first week we started dating. Stored away in a place I hardly ever look. Each time I see it, it's like a facebook post popping up...oh yeah, that guy. I have nothing more to do with him, but he was a nice guy. I've had nice dates since then, but that was a nice date. It's such a small little toy...back in the drawer.  

 * Your ancestors are watching you - Crocheted doilies. Decent handwork, discolored with age. From my grandmother. She didn't make them herself, she just had them and was happy that someone took them off her hands. Someone put effort into making them. Respect that effort. Keep the doilies forever in storage. 

There is a lot of emotional baggage with certain items. It is not so easy to sort them out and to just send them on their way.

**Finding a New Home**
 
 * Reddit Exchanges:

  * /r/redditexchange
  * /r/bookexchange
  * /r/cultureswap
  * /r/spiceexchange
  * /r/gameswap
  * /r/mysterybox
  * /r/babyexchange
  * /r/randomacts
  
 * Upcycle items: That blanket became batting for a quilt. I dyed the doilies and sewed them on a throw pillow cover. 

  * /r/sewing 
  * /r/DIY 
  * /r/woodworking 
  * /r/crafts 
  * /r/HomeImprovement 

 * Give an item as a present: I gave the little toy to a kid who was visiting us to play with. They treated it nicely and I gave it to them. The parents will get rid of it one day, but without the emotional block I had. 

  * [no buy gift giving](http://mainetoday.com/blogs/the-no-buy-gift-guide-a-k-a-regifting/)
 * Freecycle: You can put an item in the hands of someone who needs it more than you. 

**What about you?**
 
 * What makes you hold on to objects that you know you don't need or want?
 * How do you handle it?

This week, I was taking care of many family issues and couldn't do any decluttering projects. On Sunday, when I finally got to it, I found that I had been figuring out things in my head all week and knew where each item should go. 

 * I sent 4 bags of children's clothes to work with my husband for a colleague's kid who was born a few days apart from mine 2 year later. That means everything should be a perfect fit.
 * I packed up 2 boxes of extra bed linens for the local assisted living house. 
 * I packed 2 boxes of ""treasures"" of things I don't need... but I like but... I don't have space for and labelled them ""fleamarket 2013"". They can sit there for a week or two and then I will go through them again. I'll see if anything is good for ebay. If by the end of 2013 I haven't done anything with them, off they go to the local charity shop.
 * I also made the bed in my step-kid's room. It has been under a pile of my sorted-out stuff for at least 6 weeks now. She's been traveling for the last 4 months and is planning to be back in 2 months. I have that long to make my final decisions about the items. It's important to me that her space is not a ""storage room"". She decides often on short notice when she wants to stay with us and I want her to know she always has space with us.

I have a small victory but a victory none the less. I sorted my fabric stash. I've been teaching myself to sew and at the beginning every scrap of fabric was potentially useful. Now that I've done a few projects, I have an idea of what things I can and want to make. So now that i know what I want to do, I was able to get rid of lots of scraps that are harder to sew, that I thought were ugly, and that I couldn't picture a project for. 

The Exit Plan for the fabric I sorted out: 
 
* Cut up many of the pieces into rags to use around the house, 
* Make a donation bag of unuseable scraps to donate as scrap fiber
* Bundled useable scraps by color and they will appear as scraps for patchworking at 1€ a bundle at the next flea market. ",,False,,t5_2ustf,False,,,True,t3_1gjifs,http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/1gjifs/wdyd_weekly_recap_thread/,moderator

Maybe this method will help you, too.

I created a spreadsheet where I listed categories and then came up with a number of how many I need in this category. I did not consult my wardrobe to see how many I do have; this was important because when I see how many I have and then try to eliminate the unneeded ones, I end up justifying and keeping almost everything.

Sample row:

&gt; ITEM: Sweaters

&gt; NEED: 2

&gt; NOTES: 1 black or grey, 1 brown or cream, both should be nice cardigans that work with formal outfits because I wear a sweatshirt with casual outfits. 

Then I went to my sweater drawer, took out everything, rescued one black and one brown sweater, and bagged the rest for Goodwill. Ultimately, quicker and more painless than agonizing over yes-or-no for each item. 

For some categories, I wanted to keep a particular beloved item that I didn't really need. I'm allowing this, as long as it was only one or two items every few categories.

[rant]

*I'm moving cross-country (already there, but waiting on my packed belongings to arrive).  I took the opportunity while cleaning and packing to declutter some, throwing out old school notes (from elementary school, even, wow), broken toys... all sorts of stuff.  I've been wanting to declutter for a long time, and my bedroom at my parents' house has been scaring me away from it.  It's not empty now, but about 99% of what is left can go to Goodwill or other donation/thrift store, and is set out of the way for that purpose.*

*Of course, my mother is horrified by the idea of me not taking some items (about 10 large boxes worth :( ), so I've still got way too much stuff. And she insisted on driving out with me, so I can't get rid of it until after she's gone (and since the movers are later than expected, she's already bought duplicates of things I own D:).* 

[/rant]

**That's where the plan comes in:**

Every weekend (starting next weekend, 2/9-10), I am going to go through my stuff and get about 1 medium box full of things I don't want, don't need, and/or won't use.  Once I have all I can carry (I'm on the third floor), I'm going to take it to donate, or for items that still have value, post to craigslist (which is very active here).  And then I will repeat every weekend until I'm down to what I _need_ and what I _both_ want and will actually use.

---

Does this sound like a plan that might work well?

I'd kind of like a way to post and keep track of my progress (to keep me on track), so maybe I'll post updates here (editing this or putting it in the comments)?",,False,,t5_2ustf,False,,,True,t3_17mxcx,http://www.reddit.com/r/declutter/comments/17mxcx/decluttering_in_progress/,

For those who may not understand previously each of those products had its own package, with its own plastic container.  So instead of several things getting pulled out and put back every single day I have most of my items that I want right there.  I had the MAC palette on hand, but of you do not they can be purchased cheap at http://www.coastalscents.com/ and you just pull the dividers out yourself.

I have a huge project in front of me and I'm not sure how to tackle it. About a year ago I got sick and had to move back in with my family. All of my stuff from my one bedroom apartment was put in the basement of my family's home. I had a lot of stuff and now that I am healthy again I would like to start purging the stuff I don't need. 

What are some tips for purging items that are in ""storage""? I'm not using any of it now (i.e. kitchen supplies, bedding etc as I am using the stuff that my family owns) but there are some things that I can get rid of (i.e. I don't need 15 mugs and I don't eat eggs anymore so I can get rid of that egg cooker).

Any tips?

**TL;DR** - I am living back at home looking to move out soon. I am storing all of my stuff from my old one-bedroom apartment in my family's basement.
