I've read every post he has made, and the replies to all of them. The kid was crucified for saying he's an E3 and ""claiming the title of Airman"". One guy even tried to get him banned from the sub.

Here's the kicker. He **is** an E3. The kid is obviously new here, and he asked a simple question about how to find some information and he was mobbed for claiming the title Airman. Guess what guys? He never claimed he was an Airman, or at least not until he was told that he should refer to himself as a ""dumb Airman"". He went out of his way to explain that he's ANG and that he's waiting to go to BMT. He even went further than that to explain that he's not in the DEP. He has a CAC, he has uniforms, he does drill. He has a job, and they pay him for it. And guess what **pay grade** he is. E-fucking-3. He never claimed to be anything other than an E3, but even if he did... **so fucking what**. There are civilian Airmen serving all over the god dammned Air Force and they've never been to BMT. Does that make them less important to our mission? Hell no. How is this any different.

Did the kid get mouthy? Sure he did. Right after 20 people started talking mad shit to him. He wasn't being a dick, he was being defensive. Also, some people called him out on trying to wear his dads rank. He wasn't. Someone said some shit like ""until you've been through basic you're not really in the military"", and he gave the anecdotal evidence of his father who's a Gen select that never went through basic. He wasn't running around saying that everyone has to salute him or give him upvotes. He was just trying to show that people can contribute to the service without going through basic.

I love you /r/AirForce, but damn you guys can be shitty to people who are just trying to fit in. I mean hell, the kid made a second post to apologize for whatever he did to earn your wrath.

He inquires about a position at the local hardware store and the 25 year old manager hires him on the spot. The manager tells him he will start tommorrow at 9 a.m.

Tomorrow rolls around and 9 a.m. passes. The guy still hasn't shown up. Finally he strolls in around 9:15 a.m. The manager is a bit peeved but says, ""You can't be late on your first day. Don't worry about it this time. Just grab this broom and start sweeping. Tomorrow, be here at 9 a.m.""

The Air Force guy nods his head in agreement and continues to sweep the floor.

The next day 9 a.m. rolls around again and this time he is 30 minutes late. Even more mad the manager reminds him of the start time and that he may need a better alarm clock, but doesn't want to waste his time trying to hire a new employee so he decides to give him another chance.

The next day the new employee walks in at 10 a.m. The manager is furious. He says, ""What did they say to you in the Air Force if you came in an hour late everyday?!""

I see a lot of posts on here from people interested in joining.  Here's my story, and some general advice I've thought of in the last two years.

I walked in to the Air Force recruiter's office in 2011 knowing one thing - I was going to join.  I said the one thing every recruiter dreams of hearing... ""Can you give me the first job that ships?""  He laughed and of course told me to slow down a little bit.

I had some misdemeanors (disorderly conduct) to work out, and it was touch and go for a while.  I had to write a couple essays, both on my past mistakes and my current desire to join.  My waiver went all the way up to an O-6 (colonel) who called me up, and gave me a phone interview before he signed the waiver.


I wasn't an easy case, but my recruiter worked for me.  He didn't roll out a welcome mat at first, and he never called me, but I stopped in once a week to see if there were any changes.  Once he saw that I was serious about this shit, he started pushing it upwards.  

Recruiters don't need to hound people these days.  They have enough people walk into their office every day to keep them busy enough.  
They have to wade thru the guys that come in every month ""just to talk about it"", the guys who ""think it would be cool, but my girlfriend doesn't want me to leave"", the kids who blatantly lie about their eligibility.
Think of it not as a recruitment, but a job interview.  You aren't an all-star quarterback getting courted by a Division I school.  You are one of millions of 18-34 year olds that walk in to offices around the country every year, most of whom are just window shopping and want to take a practice ASVAB and score a free rubber airplane.  You have to sell yourself in order to shine through the bullshit applicants he sees every week.

 
If you are wondering about basic training, I think that everyone focuses too much on that.  It's only 8 weeks.  You're going to make it thru unless you try to fail, or lie about medical issues.  I was a nicotine and caffeine addict til the day I got bussed through those gates.  I had a horrific headache and puked the first 3 days.  Guess it was major withdrawals.  I made it though, and so will you.


I joined for 6 years.  Basic will account for 2.5% of my Air Force time.  Even if you only join for 4 years, BMT will be less than 4% of your initial enlistment.  


On my dreamsheet in basic, I put all bases in the north, or on the coast.  I like cool weather and water.  I got stationed inland in the southern half of the US.  You go where you are needed.  If that lines up with what you want, then cool.  If not, you'll learn how to deal with it.


Where am I now?  I'm a flightline maintainer, a job most people on here say to avoid.  I took it because it shipped me in 2.5 months.  Right now, I'm working 12 hour shifts, 6 days a week, somewhere in a desert.


On the other hand, I've gotten to visit Texas, Florida, Las Vegas, the Azores, Sicily, and southeast Asia.

I bought a decent car and paid it off in full.


I've got a savings account and an Associate's degree now.


I've got a team that I will work my ass off for, knowing they are doing the same for me.


I have no idea what G.I bill I signed up for, or what color running shoes I wore to basic training.  I don't even know if I'll stay in this job for more than my minimum time.  I do know that time has been flying by, and I've set myself up for future success no matter what my choice.

If you can get more done outside the Air Force in two years than I've done, then by all means do that instead!  I know that I couldn't be where I'm at any other way, and I don't regret any decision I made along the path.

In the middle of the night with no other cars on the road they hit each other head on and both cars go flying off in different directions.
The Air Force guy manages to climb out of his car and surveys the damage. He looks at his twisted car and says,.....""Man, I am really lucky to be alive!""

Likewise the Army guy scrambles out of his car and looks at his wreckage. He too says to himself, ..... ""I can't believe I survived this wreck!""

The Army guy walks over to the Air Force guy and says,...... ""Hey man, I think this is a sign from God that we should put away our petty differences and live as friends instead of archrivals""

The Air Force guy thinks for a moment and says, ...... ""You know, you're absolutely right! We should be friends. Now I'm gonna see what else survived this wreck""

So the Air Force guy pops open his trunk and finds a full, unopened bottle of Jack Daniels.

He says to the Army guy, ""I think this is another sign from God that we should toast to our new found understanding and friendship""

The Army guy replies, ""You're damn right!"" and he grabs the bottle and starts sucking down Jack Daniels. After putting away nearly half the bottle the Army guy hands it back to the Air Force guy and says, ""Your turn!""

The Air Force guy twists the cap back on the bottle and says, ""Nahh, I think I'll wait for the cops to show up.""",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_tdazq,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/tdazq/heres_a_joke_for_yall/,

Please **search** before asking your questions.

You can ask questions here even when it is not Tuesday anymore, some people still check it, including me.

Ask questions about joining the AF here.

Some quick answers:

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job, or how long it will take for you to get the job, or how long it'll take for you to get to basic training.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

So you want to be a super commando and play Call of Duty in real life, read this site: http://specialtactics.com/[1] .

If you want to know what a job is like, search for the AFSC on this site and Google (1C6x1 for example), it's probably been answered before.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_1gkj0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1gkj0f/newb_tuesday_ask_questions_about_joining_the_af/,moderator

Effective 1 April 2013 the following revised procedures will apply:

Lodging
All personnel performing temporary duty (TDY) are encouraged to stay with relatives and friends while on government business travel. If weather permits, public areas such as park benches should be used as temporary lodging sites.
Bus terminals, train stations, and office lobbies may provide additional shelter in periods of inclement weather.  Homeless shelters are encouraged.

Transportation:
Hitchhiking is the preferred mode of travel in lieu of commercial transport.
Luminescent safety vests will be issued to all personnel prior to their departure on TDY. Bus transportation will be used only when work schedules require such travel. Airline tickets will be authorized in extreme circumstances and the lowest fares will be used. For example, if a meeting is scheduled in Washington D.C., but a lower fare can be obtained by traveling to Omaha, NE, then travel to Omaha will be substituted for travel to Washington D.C.

Meals:
Overweight personnel will not receive reimbursement for any meals purchased while TDY. Expenditures for meals will be limited to an absolute minimum. It should be noted that certain grocery and specialty chains, such as Costco, Hickory Farms, General Nutrition centers, and occasionally Safeway often provide free samples of promotional items. Entire meals can be obtained in this manner. We realize many of you survive your weekends this way.

Travelers should also be familiar with indigenous roots, berries, and other protein sources available at their destinations. If restaurants must be utilized, travelers should use ""all you can eat"" salad bars. This is especially effective for employees traveling together as one plate can be used to feed the entire group. DOD Personnel are also encouraged to bring their own food on business travel. Cans of tuna fish, Spam, and Beefaroni can be consumed at your leisure without the bother of heating or costly preparation.
Cost of these items will not be reimbursed.

Miscellaneous: In order to facilitate acquisition of lodging and meals as prescribed above, the DoD has mandated viewing of the entire Survivorman series prior to travel.  The TSA will issue waivers allowing Government employees traveling on orders to carry multi-tools through airport security checkpoints.

In addition, all DOD personnel are encouraged to devise innovative techniques in effort to save tax dollars. One enterprising individual has already suggested that money could be raised during airport layover periods that could be used to defray travel expenses. In support of this idea, red caps will be issued to all personnel prior to their departure so that they may earn tips by helping others with their luggage. Small plastic roses and ballpoint pens will also be available to personnel so that sales may be made as time permits. Any remaining proceeds must be turned into the DOD finance section at the conclusion of the TDY.

1348775002.0,57,self.AirForce,10kuo8,UPDATE - Two days ago I posted about a guy I work with making unbelievable claims about his USAF service.  Here is what else I found out.,throwaway54251,69,12,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/10kuo8/update_two_days_ago_i_posted_about_a_guy_i_work/,"Original thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/10ggq0/i_work_with_a_guy_who_makes_wild_claims_regarding/)

Let's call my faker guy ""Bob"" just for simplicity.  I saw Bob yesterday and started asking him a few questions.  I did not straight up call him out, and I did this in private.  I really just wanted to verify for myself that he is lying.  

I asked him if he had any pictures of himself and/or his unit.  He said cameras were contraband in his unit because there could not be any proof of who they were, where they were, or what they did.  

I asked him what class he was in, when he graduated, who his instructors and classmates were.  He said, of course, ""That's all classified.""  And then he added, ""They didn't keep records of me or my unit.  As far as the government is concerned... I don't exist.""  Whatever.  

Apparently my questions threw him into bullshit mode because a woman we work with came into the room and heard us talking about the military.  She stated that she really wishes there were better mental health care for our service members because a lot of them are coming home with PTSD, or at the very least, are just not the same.  So Bob cuts her off, leans back in his chair with both hands behind his head, and says ""Yeah, that's why you all never hear me talk about my time 'over there.'  If you all knew all the shit I've seen...  All the shit I've been through...  All the shit I've DONE...  Let me put it to you this way, I had 22 men in my unit.  Only 2 made it back alive.  And only ONE made it back sane.""  You know, because he's such a bad ass.  

His shift ended, and he went home.  So the female coworker and I start talking.  She has worked with Bob for much longer than I have as I just started there six months ago.  So I ask her if any of his stories sound fishy to her.  She laughed and said ""Yeah, he's pretty much a pathological liar.""  I ask why she says that, and she goes on to tell me about how none of his stories adds up and how a lot of the time they clash together.  She then tells me he also claims to be a registered nurse and that he got his certification for that from all his combat medical experience.  She told me she suspected he was a liar for a long time, but she became positive of it when she met Bob's father back in December.  She asked him what Bob did in the USAF, and he said Bob was a medical supply truck driver.  And that's it.  

**TL;DR** - Bob is absolutely full of shit.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_10kuo8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/10kuo8/update_two_days_ago_i_posted_about_a_guy_i_work/,

Please **search** before asking your questions.

You can ask questions here even when it is not Tuesday anymore, some people still check it, including me.

Ask questions about joining the AF here.

Some quick answers:

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job, or how long it will take for you to get the job, or how long it'll take for you to get to basic training.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

So you want to be a super commando and play Call of Duty in real life, read this site: http://specialtactics.com/[1] .

If you want to know what a job is like, search for the AFSC on this site and Google (1C6x1 for example), it's probably been answered before.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_1hx0na,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1hx0na/newbie_questions_9_jul_15_jul/,moderator

1373819871.0,49,self.AirForce,1ia63g,"Let me tell you how to prepare for WAPS testing; I made every rank the first time, and you can too.",americanpegasus,56,7,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1ia63g/let_me_tell_you_how_to_prepare_for_waps_testing_i/,"I made E-5, E-6, and E-7 (this last cycle) my first time.  And sure, it's because the promotion system in the Air Force is flawed, but we're not here to complain about that (that's a totally different topic).  
  
We're here to understand how to beat it.  And it has nothing to do with intelligence.  It has to do simply with how much effort (*efficient effort*) you are willing to put into it.  
  
Here's the rub: You can study for a thousand hours if you want, but if you're not studying efficiently, you're wasting time.  Studying correctly isn't just endlessly reading the material, it's turning it into something that your brain is forced to digest and incorporate.  
  
Here's the best tips I have (and feel free to ask me anything if you like):  
  
- **Leave**.  I took a month of leave for every WAPS I took.  For SSgt this was slight overkill, but for TSgt I wished I had another week.  I didn't do a lot of studying prior to this leave; at best I would work my way through the material casually one time.  But for that month I told my wife and kid that I'd be available for dinner, but that was about it.  I studied about 5 to 8 hours every day, with an hour for physical fitness.  That month of leave was hardcore study time, and little else.  
  
- **The .mp3s help**.  Only a small portion of studying consisted of reading the material.  For the PDG, I had the .mp3s playing along while I read so I was forced to pay attention (the download location of which is in Chapter 1 of your PDG).  
  
- **Study like a villian**.  For the SKTs, when I read through I pretended I was making the test and wanted to make the most insidious test I could.  Therefore I didn't just highlight 'important facts'.  I highlighted the meanest and most hateful little bits I could that I thought would make brutal questions.  
  
- **MKTS Survey**.  This is pretty common knowledge these days, but the MKTS survey in Chapter 1 of the PDG is pretty crucial in finding out exactly what will be on your PDG test.  It's still nice to go through the entire book once and then focus on the MKTS important items.  I actually tore apart a PDG for my MSgt test and rearranged it in MKTS order.  
  
- **Make the information your own**.  One of the most important things I did was buy tons of art supplies and acted like I was in fourth grade again.  I had a mega-set of colored pencils, colored Sharpies, tons of notecards and other creative tools.  And for everything I thought was important, I would create my own notecard or info sheet all about it.  I used a variety of colors and doodles to make the info really pop out, and because I was the one creating this, my brain stored it differently than it would if I were just reading it.  Information that you create is held in higher regard than things you are merely passively reading.  The trick is to make your brain think that the WAPS material is your own creation.  
  
- **Immersion.**  By the time test time came around, my house looked like a crazy persons.  For every notecard or subject synopsis I made, I hung it up somewhere in my house.  My bathroom had pictures and notes all over it.  I couldn't even use the bathroom without skimming over important parts of a high-ranking MKTS chapter.  My kitchen had important concepts on every cabinet.  This both served to keep me constantly awash in PDG and SKT material, but it also provided an almost 3-D reference for it.  I distinctly remember a few questions on the test where I thought, ""Hmmm, I had a notecard about this halfway down the hallway; what did it say again?  Oh yeah...""
  
- **Usage of commercial software**.  I used commercial software each time, and it was useful, but it wasn't critical.  There's more resources than ever out there, and with a month of leave, sure you might as well dive into some of them.  But I wouldn't pin all your hopes on the software or websites out there.  At most, I would make them a third of your total studying.  
  
- **Go easy on multiple choice tests.**  One warning about endless multiple choice questions is they end up tricking your brain into memorizing the incorrect answers along with the right one.  So basically, you are wasting space.  You only have two multiple choice tests to get through (ultimately), and if you know the right answer it will jump at you from the three wrong ones.  So your time will be better spent memorizing information and facts instead of practicing picking out the right answer from wrong ones.  
  
If you have any other (non-test-compromising questions) I'll be happy to help.  I know we just had a cycle pass us by, but for those who will be testing next year, and aim to make it, the time to start planning is now.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,1373820242.0,,,True,t3_1ia63g,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1ia63g/let_me_tell_you_how_to_prepare_for_waps_testing_i/,

On Easter sunday I got one of the worst phone recalls ever, letting me know that a friend and co-worker had passed away that night in a high speed one car accident. Three people passed away and a fourth is still in critical condition. The airman that was driving was A1C D'Augustine, by all accounts a great guy, goofy as all hell, and a solid airman. I wasn't his supervisor, and by the time of the accident I didn't even work in his shop anymore, but I liked D'Aug, and had counseled him a couple of times about slowing down. He was a bit of a speed head but beyond that he was a pretty chill guy. Now he's gone and I just had to watch his friends, family, and co-workers lose it because he's gone. 
I'm not trying to blame him, or say that myself or anyone else could have prevented what happened, because ultimately he was the one who made those choices. What I am trying to say is that we are not invincible, and that our choices have consequences. I'm sure we've all gone through those weekend safety briefings and had them just pass right on through, but next time you have to give one or sit through one, stop and reflect a bit that maybe those briefings or that friend who warns you that maybe what you're doing isn't exactly safe, could end up saving your life or some one else's. 

D'Augustine is gone and nothing can change that, but maybe his death will help wake some one else up and get them to step up and say something or change the way they are acting. I know I'll be changing the way I conduct myself, because I never want to have to bury a friend and colleague under these circumstances ever again.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_1bxanv,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1bxanv/we_buried_one_of_our_own_todayaka_why_safety/,

Just wanted to say when I signed up I couldn't have imagined the adventure I've been on. Although I didn't enjoy my job, every side effect of being in the Air Force was pretty awesome.

 I got to live in Germany for two years and travel extensively, I had the time of my life there. 95% of the other Americans I met while traveling were from well off families that could afford to send their kids to Europe for fun, but not me or the other Airmen I traveled with. I realized the reason that most Europeans have a bad taste of Americans is that all they see is this unfair cross section of mostly upper class privileged Americans.  I think we gave them a reason to think otherwise.

After Germany, I was sent to Florida to finish out my contract. I live 10 minutes from some of the most beautiful beaches in the country and I'm planning on staying in Florida to finish out school. I've been pretty lucky.

As comfortable as the Air Force lifestyle is, it's time for me to move onto something that I enjoy. I've realized that it's more important to take a chance and pursue a career that makes me happy rather than sticking in one that I hate purely for job security. I know plenty of people that enjoy it and that's awesome, it's a great gig if you fit the mold. 

Anyways, it's been good. I hope you all enjoy your time in, in some way or another. ",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_1a6vxi,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1a6vxi/my_last_day_in_the_air_force_is_tomorrow/,

Some quick answers:

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job, or how long it will take for you to get the job, or how long it'll take for you to get to basic training.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

That being said, let me make a PSA to all those who command, are about to command or hope to command some day(that's you LT): there's just about no faster way to lose respect from the people beneath you than to do something blatantly hypocritical, such as violating your own blanket policies. It lets everyone know that you have no respect for the people you command and feel that the rules don't or shouldn't apply to you.

The Air Force Veterans gave a heartfelt speech at my grandfather's service. He had a 21 gun salute and they presented my grandmother with a flag for his service. It was one of the most beautiful and moving experiences of my life. I was filled not only with pride for my grandfather and his accomplishments, but also for my country.

I just got done talking to the shirt. He assured me that something would be done, and he would talk my section chief and the 3 shirts (he's an assistant, the one coming back from leave, and the one taking over as assistant when he goes on leave tomorrow). He said that the NCO would not be ignored and even asked me what I wanted done. Thanks to everyone for the help, and assurance, on this.**

So, I had the meeting with my section chief today. We ended up doing a 1 on 1 where I just told him what was going on from my point of view. He did the same with the NCO. Nothing formal, just a chat. Afterwards he told the NCO to cease all contact with my wife. 

Apparently, he had told the NCO to be careful about perceptions after bhe had seen my wife, the NCO, and NCO's kids at a base picnic with me nowhere to be found.

Overall, I don't feel like anything was really done about it. He didnt ask to see my evidence or anything, just my story. The only thing that's happened is that the NCO can it speak to her anymore (while we're together), but he even said he isn't sure how much power he actually has in this situation. He told me that if I felt that it needed to go further to just give him a heads up before doing so.

This is the general idea of the types of texts that I have: http://i.imgur.com/RONepGe.png

And [this is when she said that she was going to a different friend's house.](http://i.imgur.com/cJ6Qagp.png). For the record, I never kicked her out. We had been separated and I stayed at a hotel. We had another fight and I told her that if someone is leaving, it wasn't going to be me.

Plus, they were using an app called TextMe to hide the fact that they were talking. She stayed at his house without telling me. He never told me that she had been there. He insists that the ""feelings"" were one sided, but I'm not even sure that matters.

I don't know if I should pursue this further or just let it go and try to work on my marriage.

Ask questions about joining the AF here.

Some quick answers:

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job, or how long it will take for you to get the job, or how long it'll take for you to get to basic training.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

I've noticed things are a lot more lax here than before, but whatever I won't start that conversation. My question is I've been walking by a lot of NPS airmen and they see me, and don't salute. Now I remember getting my ass chewed out back in the from a couple Army Officers when I did have my shit together, but I don't want to be the dick LT fishing for salutes. All I'm saying is that when we encounter each other it's required. So what have you heard said, or have said to help correct an airman to make an impression so it doesn't happen again bit it's not just straight rude? 

**edit**: *Thanks for all of the feedback. I try to avoid the trainees so they don't get flustered in their academic environment, but its usually during break behind the building theres a food truck where I like to grab a Monster and a muffin, along with about 150 new Airmen/Sailors/Marines. The Marines know whats up, and always snap to attention and give me the the ol' what for, what grinds my gears is that they do it in front of a bunch of other Airmen standing right next to them and the rest of the Airmen seem to have the diffusion of responsibility sink in and become wallflowers and let the Marine show them up. I'm definitely going to use the the approach of taking them aside and having a discussion. I think they think I'm just new to the AF too and so it doesn't count. A conversation with a green rope should help, and I served with one of their instructors too in two locations so I'll bring it up with him as a problem as a whole.*",,False,self,t5_2roa2,1372886404.0,,,True,t3_1hkq0a,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1hkq0a/how_not_to_be_a_dick_lt_question/,

Please search before asking your questions.

Ask questions about joining the AF here. 

Some quick answers:

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job. 

Yes, you should still join even though Tuition Assistance is gone, it'll come back in some form before you even have the chance to use it.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

So you want to be a super commando and play Call of Duty in real life, read this site: http://specialtactics.com/.

If you want to know what a job is like, search for the AFSC on this site and Google (1C6x1 for example), it's probably been answered before.

Yes, it's not Tuesday yet in some places, but people keep posting new threads asking questions that should be here so I posted it early so they could stop doing that and I could stop deleting them.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_1akjeg,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1akjeg/newbie_tuesday_thread_post_new_guy_questions_here/,moderator

Down the street from where I live is a small shop, on the first floor is a tea place/sandwich place.  On the top floor is this artsy little craft store owned by the young wife of military member (I presume AF).  

She was telling me that she is going to have to close down the shop next month.  She didn't say why but my guess is that the shop doesn't really get a lot of traffic.  

I love supporting local business so I asked her to design and make me an ABU bi-fold wallet.  She makes all sorts of other little things out of ABU material so I thought I would give it a shot.  I have never seen a bi-fold abu wallet anywhere before.  I have seen lots of ACU wallets but they are all tri-fold.  I went in today and she actually had a prototype!  She can pretty much make them completely custom.  She said she can make it out of blouse material, the thicker gortex stuff or whatever.  She will even put my name tape on if I order one.  

So reddit, this is where you come in.  I am wondering if you guys think this is something that military guys and gals would be interested in and what kind of features do you think she should add?  If this post gets a lot of feedback she said she would make a reddit account so she can get feedback herself!  I am going to buy one from her anyways because she has put a lot of work into it already.

I will post pictures up when I get a chance.

Now with that being said, I will not profit in any way nor will I in the future (except for having an awesome wallet)

1361125969.0,36,self.AirForce,18p9cx,"Couple of people have asked me this, so here it goes: how to automate a lot of stuff when logging into a new computer",HadManySons,39,3,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/18p9cx/couple_of_people_have_asked_me_this_so_here_it/,"I made a comment on a [post a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/18evgk/how_do_you_do_your_email_signature/c8ea2w4) and since then a few people have PM'd me about how to do what I described, so here it is.

Lets say you're in a typical squadron with anywhere from 20 to 40 computers and you're not lucky enough to have one of your own. You, like the rest of us, have to use whatever computer is available and if you've never logged into that computer before, that means you have to start from scratch with things like mapping the squadron share drive, mapping to any printers you use regularly or starting over with you outlook email signature. 

Well, I have a way to automate all that. A few simple commands in something called a [batch file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file), store it somewhere (like your own personal folder on the share drive) and every time you log in to a new computer just run this batch file(which I will refer to ask 'the script' from here on) and wa-la, it does all that crap for you. Plus, it's not a security risk (like those pesky USB drives) or anything because the script doesn't do anything you wouldn't have already done, it just automates it all. Also, this information isn't AF specific in any way, you could use this file if you get out and move into the corporate world. So, lets break it down and then I'll put it all together at the end.

**TL;DR The paragraphs are only to explain the process to those not so technically savvy. If you're a pretty good with computers, just skip to the bottom and copy the code and go from there.**

To start, this whole is kind of predicated on you have your own personal folder somewhere on the squadron share drive (I: drive as it's commonly called). Something like I:\your_flight\personal_folders\your_last_name or something like that. The reason being is that this gives you a place to store your outlook signatures and commonly used shortcuts so that the script has a common place to copy them from. If you don't have one, make one. If your supervision won't allow it then you'll just have to do with out and will only be able to automate the mapping of network drives and printers, no signature or shortcut copying.

* If you want the script to copy your outlook signature, do this:

To start, you'll need to make a signature in outlook first. This gives us the initial signature to copy from, and then is used as the template for later. Once you've done that, you'll have to find them to copy them to your personal folder. To find your signatures, press WindowsKey and r and the same time to bring up the run dialog and type ""%appdata%\Microsoft\Signatures"" and press enter. Once that folder opens up, copy everything in there (folders and all) to a folder called ""OutlookSig"" in your personal folder. The line of code that does this is here:

    robocopy ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder\OutlookSig"" ""%appdata%\Microsoft\Signatures"" /s

1. [robocopy](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc733145%28v=ws.10%29.aspx) is the command to copy stuff, short for robust copy
2. The first set of quotes is the path to your OutlookSig folder and must be exact and in quotes
3. The second set of quotes will direct robocopy to copy from your OutlookSig folder to the local signature folder on the computer.
4. the /s makes sure that robocopy copies the subdirectories as well


* If you want a folder of commonly used shortcuts, do this:

Now make a folder in your personal folder called ""Shortcuts"". In here you can place any shortcuts you use regularly in here, things like shortcuts to GO-81/CAMS, JPAS, etc... The script will then copy theses shortcuts to the desktop.

    robocopy ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder\Shortcuts"" ""%userprofile%\Desktop"" /s

1. robocopy, same as above
2. path to your shortcut folder, also must exact and in quotes.
3. path to your desktop on that specific computer
4. same as above

* if you want the script to map any drives you commonly use, do this:

All you need to do for this part is make sure you know the path to these drives/folders and the drive letter you'd like them to be assigned to. For example, it seems that everyone squadron share drive is always called the I: drive. Not sure why, but that appears to be a constant. And if you're a records custodian, you probably have an R: drive too. All these drives are is just a shortcut to a network location. Your I: drive is something like \\base_server\squadron_share_drive and so on. The line in the script will look like this:

    NET USE P: ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder"" /p:YES

1. The [NET](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/251394) USE part is the command to start the mapping process.
2. The P: is the drive letter you'd like to assign, so it could be anything not already used (C,D,A and I are usually already taken).
3. The part in quotes is the path to the folder and must be exact.
4. The /p:YES is short for persistent, meaning that it will be there everytime you log in

And you just rinse and repeat for every network drive you need mapped.

* and last but not least, m apping commonly used printers:

This part is easy or hard, depending on your computer know-how. You need to find the base printer server, and then figure out what the printers you use are called. The line in the script will look like this:

    START \\printer_server\printer_name

1. [START](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/start.mspx?mfr=true) is just the command to open the resource
2. \\printer_server\printer_name is the path to the printer.

The great about mapping printers this way is that windows will automatically download the correct/best printer driver for you so there's none of that ""WTF, I KNOW this printer does double sided"" crap. I wish I could say something more helpful about how to find the printers here but every base is different and there is no specific technique that I can point to. Perhaps some comm guy/gal can comment on a way to make that easier.

**With that, here's the code all put together in a complete file:**

    @ECHO MAP I: DRIVE 
    NET USE I: ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive"" /p:YES
    
    @ECHO MAP P: DRIVE 
    NET USE P: ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder"" /p:YES
    
    @ECHO PRINTER NUMBER 1
    START \\printer_server\printer_name
    
    @ECHO PRINTER NUMBER 2
    START \\printer_server\other_printers
 
    @ECHO COPY SIGNATURES
    robocopy ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder\OutlookSig"" ""%appdata%\Microsoft\Signatures"" /s
 
    @ECHO COPY SHORTCUTS
    robocopy ""\\path\to\squadron\share_drive\your\personal\folder\Shortcuts"" ""%userprofile%\Desktop"" /s


Hold the F up, what is that @[ECHO](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490897.aspx) shit? It just prints a line to remind you what the line of code below it does, so you don't look at this file in a year and go ""I have no memory of this""

Great, now how do you put this all together? Open up notepad by pressing winkey and r and typing ""notepad"" and press enter. Then put the completed code in notepad and save it as a batch file. To do this, goto save and type ""Whatever you want to call it.bat"". The quotes and the .bat at the end are very important. Otherwise it will just be saved as a text file and won't work. Now just place this bad boy in your personal folder (or email it to yourself if you don't have one) and run it (double click it) everytime you log into a new computer and BAM!, all that pain in the ass crap is taken care of. Should work on Windows 7, vista and XP.

Should any problems arise with finding the path to the squadron share drive, path to printers and so just find your coworker who is good with computers (there's one in every squadron) and seek their help. Should that fail you, post here and I'll do my best. I will NOT however make a file for you or post anything about any specific base or location on here for obvious OPSEC reasons.

I'm sure comm guys/gals will jump in here and add any specific advice or relevant regulations to the discussion which is most welcome. I hope this helps people out and makes a lot of the hassle of using a new computer easier. If you ever PCS/PCA, just email the file to yourself and reconfigure it when you get to your new work center.

**Obligatory ""upvote for visibility, self-post = no karma"" statement**

**edit:** If you ever need to change your signature, just edit it on the computer and then copy those files into your OutlookSig folder and rerun the script on any computer you log into again and it'll copy them over. It won't hurt anything.

advice here before I go and do anything stupid. I made a throwaway account just for the hell of it.

Ive been in the AF a year; my experience with it varies but for the most part it has been good. But recently I've been having some issues and it's swiftly and noticeably affecting the way I work and my enthusiasm to work. 

My supervisor, I feel, is harassing me (I see it with nobody else, just myself) and it's beginning to take its toll on me to the point that I actually want to leave the AF after my term is up.

A good example is I am working quite hard and out of no where he steps up to me and goes ""Get the FUCK to work!"" and just walks off. Ten seconds before, I was in the zone. My productivity couldn't be higher, and now I feel like something stepped in and I get little done the rest of the day. 

Another occured recently. Keep in mind, my supervisor will come and
find me to check up on me (Meanwhile Im praying he doesnt randomly
spaz for no reason). I was in a meeting with another Airman and he
walks in. I assumed he was checking on me again. Turned out he wanted the Airman I was in the meeting with. I ask if he needed me and he says ""Was I fucking talking to you?"". I just blink at him
dumbfoundedly and he tells me I spoke out of turn.

I express my dislike of his behaviour against me and he just replies with ""If you don't like it, take it up with my boss"", which is fairly high hiked up the chain. I have tried to talk with him about how he treats me but apparently it doesn't get through. I have spoken with the NCOIC about it and he assured me it's just him being ""his creeper and awkward self"", and to not take him seriously. It is clear to me that due to his attitude in general, he is not well liked within the shop and in turn it affects how he treats others.

Unfortunately for me, I see this differently than 'casual joking' and I do not like being spoken to this way. I am having trouble coming into work every day with the prospect of getting yelled at for literally no reason at all.

My question to you folks is, should I confront him yet again with this matter, jump to the NCOIC again, or go directly to the superintendent? Or, am I just being too soft and need to grow a pair?

Thanks for reading, hope someone can help me..

Here's mine:

It is so much easier...to just do what you're supposed to do. There is so much less stress, so much less doubt following you around, and so many benefits to just not fucking up.

My first shop supervisor taught me and another young airman how to skimp on work and how to duck out of work for illegitimate reasons. At the time, we worked under civilians and he taught us to take advantage of them. For a while, we went to ""PT"" every day and just left an hour and a half early every day. It will catch up to you.

If you know you are doing what you're supposed to, then there really isn't much to be stressed about. You don't have to worry about eventually being caught. You don't have to scrape the barrel for EPR bullet material.

It comes with a downside. If you're reliable, people are going to rely on you. If you're the airman that gets shit done, then people are going to come to you when they need shit done. It seems like more work and, frankly, it is. But it is so much more rewarding and confidence building.

If I'm out of the office, people will vouch for me and assume I'm somewhere I'm supposed to be, because I usually am. This is something I've had to earn. If you're the office shitbag, people know it. They're going to question everything you do and look for reasons (and sometimes make up reasons) for why you should be in trouble.

Don't be an asshole to people, do what you're told, and do what is expected of you, and you're going to have an easy and enjoyable time.

**TL;DR:** You don't have to be a turd Airman if you don't want to be.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_120qe7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/120qe7/your_most_helpful_nugget_of_advice/,

I can understand randomly setting up radar/lidar once or twice a week, but pulling people over for 1-2 miles over the speed limit while sitting in the same spot, day in and day out at the exact same times is becoming really irritating. 

The circles in red are where I've seen SF most often. Just outside of the west gate is the most consistent. Every day around 1100 and again at 1600 are the most popular times for obvious reasons. In the morning between 0630 and 0730, they'll generally crowd closer to the gate trying to catch people coming in. 

For the inevitable naysayers that will tell me that I've got nothing to worry about if I'm not doing anything wrong, I've never had a speeding ticket in my 12 years of driving. However, having to set my cruise control for 38 mph in a 40 zone just to make sure that I'm not doing 42 mph when coasting down a hill becomes very, very irritating. 

I hope this catches on and the rest of you post bases of your own. [I'll update this](http://i.imgur.com/3tEpQ.jpg) if I spot anything else.

You can ask questions here even when it is not Tuesday anymore, some people still check it.

Ask questions about joining the AF here.

Some quick answers:

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job, or how long it will take for you to get the job, or how long it'll take for you to get to basic training.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

So you want to be a super commando and play Call of Duty in real life, read this site: http://specialtactics.com/ .

Hopefully it will assist those looking to retrain. Goes through the first part that is pretty well hidden. After this, AFPC and common sense guides you pretty much the rest of the way through. 

Having went through the process last year let me help you out some. Obviously, your first step should be to speak to your chain of command about your intentions. After that, give up a call to the enlisted career adisor on your base. If you cant find out who it is, give a call to your in service recruiter. They should point you in the right direction. I cannot stress enough that you talk to your chain, since there will be letters you will possibly need from the commander, as well as at the end of it AFPC submits the whole package to your CC to ask if he concurs or not. Having a random package just pop into his inbox is a sure fire way of him non concuring, and while in the end it is up to AFPC and career functionals, having a concur looks better than non. Plus, it's simply the right way to do things. 

There are some other oddities (No referal EPRs, no control roster, no UIF..etc), but this is the general rule for early retrain (Also known as CAREERS): 

4-year enlistees must be within the 35th and 43rd month of their current enlistment to apply

6-year enlistees must be within the 59th and 67th month of their current enlistment to apply

Must not be under investigation by the Office of Special Investigation (OSI) or law enforcement officials (excluding normal security clearance)

Most recent EPR must be at least 3 or higher, not be a referral and not be a projected referral

Must not be ineligible for promotion or reenlistment

Must not be in Training Status Code ""0"" (not recommended for entry into upgrade training)


The critical listing comes out with updates every so now and then, so ensure you check it before you write up your package. To find the critical listing, go to the mypers site, click enlisted, as highlighted. Type in Critical List, as show, then click search, as highlighted [example] (http://i.imgur.com/xNg4Ptx.png). You should then come to this screen. Click on Active Duty Enlisted Chronic Critical Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSC) List, as highlighted. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/gbdl0vp.png) The results will look like this. At the bottom will be the Retrain Advisory link, as highlighted, you'll want to click that. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/vRbnWsa.png) It will look like this. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/sdCDJDh.png) The information you are trying to look for is the AFSC of the critical listed jobs, from the earlier screen. Once you find that, look under the FTA column, as highlighted, for the numbers they are wanting for the FY listed. Also ensure it says OBJ IN. You best chances are to pick jobs that have high numbers. Even if you are an NCO, since its your first enlistement, you still fall under the FTA boxes. I highlighted the information you want as well. 

To start the process, go to the mypers site, and on the home page after loging in, click on Apply for Retraining as I have highlighted. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/XLqgtSu.png)

Youll then come to this screen. I recomend reading through it all. Once you are finished, click the Request Retraining button, as I have highlighted.  [example] (http://i.imgur.com/2ZWmnQC.png)

Youll come to this screen. Click the CAREERS button, and anwer the ineligibility question. I can't remember where to find this out, but assume the answer is no. Then click submit. You SHOULD then come to a screen that has 5 drop down boxes for your career choices you wish to retrain into. I HIGHLY suggest you fill all five. There is a reason for this, and I will explain that later. THen you have to wait. (Lost the screenshot for this, but it should be self explanitory)

Eventually, AFPC will send you a notification saying if your eligibility has been approved or not. To check this, its on the mypers site. Click my account at the top of the screen, as highlighted, and then incidents, as highlighted. You should see one that says something along the lines of Retrain Request - FTA, as highlighted. [example] (http://i.imgur.com/CXfDYS8.png) 

This will be the message log between you and them. After you get approval, they will send you a message stating you  are, as well as details of everything you need to do from there. 

Some information once you get to the finished part. 

Once your application is completely finished, you will meet up to three boards. (online automated computer slection process). There are varying times people will give you on when the boards meet, but a good rule of thumb is to call AFPC to find out when you meet the first one. If you get selected on the first board, congrats! If not, it will go to second, and then third. If not selected by the third time, you cannot retrain anymore until you are eligble again. Note: CAREER (early) retraining USES your First Term Airmen retrain, so if you dont get accepted, you'll have to wait until you can try again. 

The process is long and frustrating at points. Use all your resources available to you. CONSTANTLY CALL AFPC. I cannot stress this enough. The more you bug them about things, the better it will be. Just don't go overboard. Once every couple days is probably good. 

If you have any other questions, PM me and Ill do what I can to help, since there are some more tricky steps such as uploading documents, another website to mess with, etc.

One female said ""hey guys make sure you let the ladies sit first before you all sit down."" This kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I mean if they were pregnant sure they should have first dibs at seats. However, I've always thought that while in uniform both sexes should be treated equally. IMHO, doing things like holding the door open for females, giving them priority seating, etc implies they are a weaker sex which for the most part is contradictory to everything the military teaches us.

* He was Special Forces in the Air Force.
* He was a personal escort for Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi when they each visited the White House back in the '80s (when he was approximately 24 years old).
* Due to his high-level security clearance, he has meetings with the CIA every month because he is head of security (rent-a-cops) at a chemical plant along the Gulf Coast.
* Anytime anyone questions him (e.g. ""Where were you stationed?""), he responds with ""That's classified.""

I would like to know if he is full of it.  Each of his claims seems far-fetched on its own, but even more so when they are all put together.  If he is lying, I don't think it is right.  If he is telling the truth, then maybe he shouldn't be divulging all of this information?  Sorry for any formatting errors.

This is a just an example, but check out the comments on the recent post [Young Rank](http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/wwr0m/young_rank/).  A few of our fellow airmen made some unpopular comments and they got downvoted significantly.  These sort of comments are what brews interesting and entertaining conversations.  The below excerpts are straight out of the [reddiquite](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). 

&gt;**Vote**. The up and down arrows are your tools to make reddit what you want it to be. If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to reddit or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

&gt;**Downvote opinions just because they are critical of you**. The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion.

&gt;**Downvote opinions just because you disagree with them**. The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion.

No one has messaged the mods yet about this, but it’s just a trend that I’ve noticed recently on r/AirForce, and reddit in general.  

**TL, DR: Don’t downvote comments/posts just because you disagree with them.  Downvote them if they are being assholes, add no content, or are providing blatantly wrong information.**

**Disclaimer:** While containing nuggets of truth, this list is for entertainment purposes. Don't follow these; actually study.


* If any answer presents a combination of other choices (ex. ""All of the above""), it's probably correct.
* If an answer contains a keyword from the question, it is most likely correct.
* If two answers contain keywords from the question, the answer that contains more keywords is more correct.
* Doctrine is written more skillfully than test question answers. The more official looking and grammatically sound answer is generally correct.
* This is the least reliable rule, but slightly more often than not, the longer answer is the correct answer

Some actual advice: The real golden rules are to know the material and read the questions and answers carefully. If you visually trip over the wording of anything, reread it carefully.

Why would recruiters not do everything in their power to ensure you were happy with your job? I would imagine that your productivity would be significantly higher than if you were just put into a job you really have no interest in...

My example is that I am a photographer. I chose the job and I enjoy my job. I work hard to produce the best product possible and strive to learn every day. I would estimate that over 70% of the career field is open general/washouts from other career fields. And most of those people just show up to collect a paycheck without really having any desire to produce good work. This means that we are not getting the most out of the 450ish people we have... We could probably cut those numbers by 25% and still be able to accomplish what we need to just by having people who want to be there..

I am sure this is applicable to other career fields. I can't count how many people in my job who have said, ""I wish I could have been XXXXX AFSC."" and I have heard hundreds of people in other career fields that would LOVE to be a photographer.

Personally I would rather work with people who WANT to be there... I am sure most would agree with me.

So why would it be so hard to just make a little bit of an effort to just get people the job they want, rather than just quick shipping kids to BMT and randomly assigning jobs that they qualify for..

I out processed from finance on the 16th; they said it would be 10 days. When those 10 days were up I was told the check was still waiting approval, but that it would be done next week. I called finance that monday and was told that the check was approved and it would be going to my bank tuesday. Wednesday I was told it was not approved because separations had the wrong date for my DOS. 

Separations had June 11, but my orders had may 18. the 18th was the correct date, but because I was out processed from separations they couldn't change it. The problem was sent to AFPC who sent it to DFAS. DFAS was supposed to have handled it (I could never get a hold of anyone at DFAS). At this time it is thursday, and I was told the check would be going out by last friday. My bank would take a few days to process, but I should be paid by today. They also said they would no longer take my call and that all my questions should be routed through my (former) shirt. 

Then monday I call finance (because I don't have to listen to Msgts anymore) and I was told it was sitting on their out-processing sgts desk, and that he would call me when he was out of his meeting. I called back a few hours later, and got into a confrontation with the ssgt who answered because she wouldn't talk to me. So I call my shirt and he says that the check would be going out that monday. Now I'm being told the check was sent to my bank monday, but my bank doesn't have any inbound checks for my account. 

What can I do? Should I be doing anything right now or should I wait? How long?

I was expecting that money to pay rent and bills while I looked for a job, but now I'm having to borrow money from my and my wife's family.

",LostLT,30,6,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/184x1a/if_youre_enlisted_and_able_to_go_officer_why_not/,"First off, I'm completely fine with anybody's reasoning as it's a personal decision for each individual's life goals and expectations. The reason I did not enlist out of high school or early college is because I had a full scholarship to my university. Later in college, I decided to join AFROTC and got my commission through that avenue. If it wasn't for that nice situation, I would have definitely enlisted and served in that capacity. I’m only a lost LT, and I don’t know shit about shit on active duty. I know it, you know it, and so does everybody else. I know my place and my “role” in the dynamic leader/subordinate-ship. I show nothing but the highest respect to every enlisted person I meet and try to gather wisdom from their point of view. I have also found that EVERYBODY, from the Colonel I work for to the A1C that’s in our office, seems to understand that I’m just a 22-year old dude that just got this rank out of a random detachment in the South and can only do so much and do the best I can. I have seen so many young guys/gals my age, that are enlisted, that can do the job twice as good as I am with the same leadership capacity as any other LT out there. Thoughts? 

Off track there.

If you have a dual screen set-up on your computer and you're sick of using stock wallpapers or having duplicate wallpapers on your screens, try this out.

Set your resolution to: 1280x1024

Find a wallpaper that you like that is resolution: 2560 x 1024

Open the file in paint -&gt; File -&gt; Set as Desktop Background -&gt; Tile

If you don't do it through paint, it will not work. If you do it through personalization on your desktop it will just duplicate on both screens.

If you want to work with a bigger resolution, just double the width and search for wallpapers at that size.

Ask questions about joining the AF here.

Some quick answers:

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job, or how long it will take for you to get the job, or how long it'll take for you to get to basic training.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

So you want to be a super commando and play Call of Duty in real life, read this site: http://specialtactics.com/[1] .

If you want to know what a job is like, search for the AFSC on this site and Google (1C6x1 for example), it's probably been answered before.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_1iebub,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1iebub/newbie_questions_for_week_16_july_22_july/,moderator

Like the title says, I was chewed out for ""not owning a mandatory piece of a uniform"" today by my Squadron Superintendent. The piece in question is the zip-up Air Force PT jacket. Myself and several others were given about six hours notice that we would be participating in an ""NCO Run"" on the post where we work (And I would like to add, I am not even an NCO) This is an Army base so we usually don't participate in a lot of their morale type events but early today we received notification that we were required to attend this run later in the afternoon. 

The e-mail notifying us of this event specified that the AF personnel in attendance were to wear the PT shorts, PT Jacket, and a reflector belt. About one year ago, I ripped one of the sleeves of my PT jacket pretty badly but I never bothered to replace it because I also own a PT sweater (the grey one) that was purchased no more than two years ago and I use (and prefer) when it is cold enough to merit wearing it. Our section was absolutely slammed all day, the kind of day where I take 10 minutes to wolf down some food before returning to work, and at no point would I have had anywhere near enough time to go out and purchase a jacket just for this run. In my section, we are required to always have a set of PT gear in our locker, in the event that they call an unexpected mandatory PT session for that day so I do keep all the items that I could ever need on hand: running shoes/socks, a pair of AF PT shorts and pants, shirt, sweater, reflective belt, and watch cap.

When I showed up at the run, I was literally berated for ""not owning a piece of a uniform"" and now my supervisor was saying that the superintendent is pressuring him into giving me paperwork.

Please tell me that I'm not crazy for thinking there is in no way some kind of regulation that states owning the PT jacket is mandatory and that being tasked to show up to an event with the circumstances I described above is something I could get paperwork over? Anybody else ever been through anything like this?

**TL;DR** I have always used the grey AF PT sweater instead of the jacket for PT when it's cold outside because I no longer own the jacket and I got my ass chewed for it today. What reg. states it's mandatory to own the jacket?

**Edit:** So SilentD cleared it up and it appears I am in the wrong. It sucks to be wrong and looks like I'll be buying a damn PT jacket but I appreciate everyone's input.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,1349291599.0,,,True,t3_10vpr8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/10vpr8/so_i_was_chewed_out_by_my_squadron_superintendent/,

Now, here's the thing. After all this happened, I tried to submit paperwork. Basic LOR. Chief told me he wouldn't sign off on it because it made the wing look bad. Co-workers wouldn't corroborate my story. I'm stuck with a grossly insubordinate airman who I can't file paperwork against. I obviously can't touch this airman but he's stuck with me in a forward deployed location. 


I've seen this play out a few times. Next time, I'd like to know what to do. NCO's, what advice do you have? Obviously I am MX. It's not reasonable to take this to the base commander. I need to work with the resources available to me. What would you do with an insolent airman?

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job.

This is not a volunteer thing, or a club, it is mandatory. I just don't see how you can order someone to ride their motorcycle with the Squadron or not...

**UPDATE**

So i asked one of the SQ motorcycle safety reps what happens to the Airmen who do not show up to the mandatory ride. (I remember him bitching about the lack of 100% attendance at the last ride). His reply was ""nothing"". So while the ride is sold to the squadron as a mandatory formation for all motorcycle riders, there isn't any actual enforcement, not by the people who run the ride at least.

Furthermore, understand that I don't actually own or ride a motorcycle, but I have troops who do and I think that the policy is BS.

The ride has nothing to do with riding your motorcycle on base, or your base riding privileges. Even if you never rode your bike on base your are still expected to attend the ride every month. There are also tons of other squadrons who have motorcycle riders that don't participate in monthly rides.

I highly doubt that this policy came down from the commander, rather I believe that it was pushed by one of the motorcycle safety reps (probably as a way to skip work once a month).

I'm not really sure if there is anywhere else to take it, although they threaten missing the formation with paperwork, the policy is not enforced. Does that still make it mandatory? Faux-mandatory perhaps?

You can ask questions here even when it is not Tuesday anymore, some people still check it.

Ask questions about joining the AF here.

Some quick answers:

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job, or how long it will take for you to get the job, or how long it'll take for you to get to basic training.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

So you want to be a super commando and play Call of Duty in real life, read this site: http://specialtactics.com/ .

If you want to know what a job is like, search for the AFSC on this site and Google (1C6x1 for example), it's probably been answered before.",,False,self,t5_2roa2,False,,,True,t3_1eba9p,http://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1eba9p/newb_tuesday_ask_questions_here_all_week/,moderator

Maintaining a few folk's computers, how does affect the overall mission? Day in and day out, whenever a computer goes offline, my shop was always quick to get them back up, most of the time within minutes of it going down. One day we had a typical issue of a computer going down, after a quick inspection, it turns out that the CAT5 cable connected to that pc was damaged due to the previous user jarring it pretty hard when they got up. Eh, just nothing, right? A simple fix; I never thought twice about it.  
  
Well, coming in for duty a few days after that, I got word that I had helped save 9 people's lives. Wait, what? There's gotta be some mistake here, I've only been keeping the lights green by doing my job, nothing really outside of that; what in the world were they talking about? Come to find out that one of the operators who got on the computer immediately after I fixed it discovered a large IED hidden along side a road where a convoy of nine was due to pass very shortly. Barely managing to fire the message up in time, they were diverted away. Recognition was passed to the operator, then my shop heard about it. Ultimately, if I hadn't replaced that cable, no one would have been able to recognize that threat or pass the message up, and someone's family would have to be dealing with a husband/wife/son/daughter that wouldn't be coming home.

To the Airmen of the United States Air Force



Earlier today, I was sworn in as the 20th Chief of Staff of our Air Force. It was a pretty humbling experience. Since I haven’t met most of you, I thought my first move as CSAF should be to say hi. You’ll probably get tired of hearing me say that “every Airman has a story,” but it’s true, and I’m no different. 

My story starts with family. My dad, who was the greatest patriot, officer, and leader I’ve ever known, taught me that no rank or title would ever be as important as the unit patch I wore. Today, I wear the Air Force patch, and my family has grown to 690,000 active, Guard, Reserve, and civilian Airmen, all serving as part of an unbeatable Joint team.

YOU are what makes our Air Force the best the world has ever known!

Thank you for your service, your sacrifice, your dedication and commitment. Most of all, thank you for the privilege of serving beside you and your families. Betty and I are so honored to represent you and will do everything in our power to do it in a way that makes you proud. 

From Tooey Spaatz’s drive and vision in 1947, to General Norty Schwartz’s steady hand and thoughtful leadership over the past four years, our Air Force has benefited from strong Chiefs of Staff throughout its rich heritage. I wish I could tell you I bring the same IQ and talent level to the job as they did, but that would be a stretch. So I just promise you I’ll do my very best, every day, every task…just like you do.

You need to know that I care about each of you, your mission, your training, your equipment, your professional development, your career, and your family. My job is to prove it to you.

I’ll get back to you after I’ve had a chance to sit down with Secretary Donley and benefit from his wise counsel. I’ll let you know what my focus areas will be and where I think we’re headed. In the meantime, you take care of the “Fly, Fight, and Win” part…and I’ll ensure that “Integrity, Service, and Excellence” aren’t just buzz words I use in speeches. 



MARK A. WELSH, III
General, USAF
20th Chief of Staff

Please search before asking your questions.

You can ask questions here even when it is not Tuesday anymore, some people still check it.

Ask questions about joining the AF here.

Some quick answers:

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job, or how long it will take for you to get the job, or how long it'll take for you to get to basic training.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

So you want to be a super commando and play Call of Duty in real life, read this site: http://specialtactics.com/[1] .

Long story short, I was deployed downrange and was placed on emergency leave upon notification of my brother's passing.  He is Active Duty Army and his unit is hosting a memorial service in his honor.  I feel it's appropriate that I be in dress blues to honor him properly; unfortunately, my uniform is still back at my home station and I wasn't able to bring it with me.
  
I know this might not be the appropriate forum to ask, but I'm short on time and I'm looking everywhere for alternatives.  Thanks in advanced guys.

Again, a million thanks for all the help.**

* There's no easy way into a hard job.  Hard work pays off big. If you want to be a pilot, be diligent in your studies. If you want into Special Operations, work out (and swim) every chance you get. No shortcuts.

Repeat: I AM NOT COMPLAINING.

Good, now anyone who accuses me of bitching about this can go auto fornicate in a corner. 

So I went to the base club last night and saw Mitch Fatel as the headlining act of a comedy show wrapping up its tour with our base. I had seen him before on Comedy Central and YouTube, and really enjoyed the show, mostly. There were a few cringe-worthy moments, but most good comedians can elicit those from any audience. 

For those of you who haven't seen or heard this guy's stand up, it's a LOT of jokes about boobs, dicks and oral sex. A *lot*. Like, 98% of the show. And a lot of them were hilarious.

What I'm wondering is with the SAPR culture we're rapidly becoming, how do acts like this still get on base? A lot of folks walked out last night, including, from what I'm told (it wasn't my base so I didn't recognize the faces) the wing commander and command chief. I can imagine it would hard to prosecute an actual SAPR or SARC case when they were just seen at the club laughing at some of the filthiest jokes I've heard in a long time. These are jokes that, should you or I tell them at work or even off duty somewhere, and the wrong person overheard, we could be in serious career jeopardy. 

Considering we were the last stop on the tour, it's not like someone out there didn't see these jokes coming. So what is it? I'd love to think someone somewhere has decided that we're adults and can decide for ourselves what we do and do not wish to hear and see, but I've been in the Air Force long enough to know that that probably isn't the case.

Thoughts?

When I was in Tech School('97), you could swap assignments. Not sure if you can do that now. I had no desire to go to Germany at the time because I was dumb and in a relationship with someone and wanted to be closer to home. The majority of my flight in Tech School was spread across Ramstein, Aviano, Kunsan, Minot, Grand Forks, and Malmstrom. I remember one guy getting Eglin(no idea how), another one Tinker, and Cannon. I mentioned that I wanted to trade and everyone from Minot, Grand Forks, and Malmstrom wanted to trade. The guy who got Cannon really wanted to go to Germany and I almost traded with him but my MTL took me aside and said, ""Son, I've been stationed in Cannon and I'm telling you to go to Germany."" So, I didn't trade.

Sorry about the back story. Ramstein was a blast! Back then, we rode a stationary bike for PT tests and we never did PT. There was a movie rental store called ""Moms"" and a ton of dorm rats at Fred's Lounge. I hear Ramstein is exercise city now and I may have done 3 or 4 during my two years there.

Long story short: 

I've been enlisted for about two years now (but really only 3 months in operational. I had/have a medical issue that put me out of service for about 1 and a half years)
I'm still going through Chemo Therapy, it sucks. One of the many side effects is memory loss, be it short term or long term, and trouble focusing/concentrating.

So now that you know I'm not normally this...stupid... I beg for your mercy.

So here it goes...
My question:

I can't remember the order of chain of command. And I'm too embarrassed to ask my supervisor. (I'm an A1C soon to be SrA...ya i know)

So lets say I need to talk to someone (as an example, I'm fine, but since I can't remember it's bothering me. You know, just in case) and I go up the coc. Lets see if I got this right. First person would be my supervisor first, SSgt X. If it doesn't get solved, then is it to the NCOIC? Or is it the TSgt above my supervisor, then the NCOIC? 
Then after that if it doesn't get resolved is it the First shirt -&gt; SMSgt Functional Manager (Senior) -&gt; Chief -&gt; and then Squadron Commander. ??? Then after that the Group Ommander?
Or is it different? I'm sure it is and I can't for the life of me recall the order.
Please let me know some examples of title and the name and rank. Like NCOIC TSgt SoandSo


A flow chart would be perfect, but the only ones I can find are of high higher ups coc
 I feel like such a retard right now, I couldn't even find it on google.

I was one of those. Honestly, I still am. One of the common things I read on here is that some of you are a little apprehensive about going to a recruiter and talking to him/her about potentially enlisting into the Air Force. I'm here to give you my personal experience about a little bit of the process. Note: this is my personal experience and, while I certainly hope it's not the case, your experience may differ.

I had been thinking of joining the military for quite some time. My reasons for joining are probably some of yours as well: dead end job, self-fulfillment, to get away from a bad place, earn good money, etc.. so I just consider myself the Average Greg in this process. Nothing special about me at all. Just a guy trying to join the military with no prior experience.

I started my process by filling out the ""Request More Information"" form on airforce.com. (Which btw is a great website for info, regardless of whats been told to you.) I consider that the equivalent of calling the recruiter personally, but I decided not do that and just filled out the form seeing as it was quick and easy.

It took a few days for the recruiter to contact me but it was understandable. I submitted the form late on a Friday night, so there was a weekend that followed and a Government holiday the following Monday. The recruiter finally contacted me at 4:30 on Wednesday and went through the whole Q&amp;A process that you've probably already heard about by now. My recruiter seemed very nice and cordial and it genuinely seemed like he wanted to advance me through the process and enlist me in the Air Force.

The next step was to get me into his office and take the Practice ASVAB. (I hadn't taken it up to this point.) He scheduled a meeting at 10:00 for the upcoming Friday. I showed up to the office a little early, about 15 minutes early just to be prompt and safe. He showed up about 2 minutes late, but profusely apologized to me and opened up the office. 

I took the Practice ASVAB and scored pretty good on it, so we went and sat down and discussed me joining the AirForce. He made it a point to make sure that I was ready to make a decision as big as the one I was about to make. He even told me that he wouldn't mind if I took a few weeks to make sure that was something I wanted. 

Of course, I said yes. We then went through the whole paperwork process. Medical stuff, my credit report, my case file, etc... He even made a few joke about how "" The Air Force is the leading technological branch in the U.S. Military, and we use more paper than anyone!"" I laughed at that. He did a good job with keeping the mood light and not as serious as a business meeting.

We end ended the meeting after he showed me the standard Air Force recruiting video and even showed me a video on the kind of job I wanted (Security Forces.) I left the meeting very, very satisfied with the whole thing, and it even increased my interest in the Air Force that much more.

I had to get some medical records from the hospital, and get my tattoos approved by the Commander, but he's been in constant communication with me since I left the office. Right now, as soon as I get my medical records to him, Ill be up to MEPS within a week. He's taken care of me.

- Don't run into shit.
- Every so often, get the vehicle up to highway speed and open the throttle to blow out the EGR.  Letting them sit and idle for long periods of time tends to clog them up.
- If you see a challenging driving obstacle and you think you can ""make it"", think again.
- Bring it in for minor issues that affect its safety and serviceability (light out, funny noise, low fluid, tire pressure, etc.)  Letting these issues pile up until its scheduled maintenance guarantees a longer turnaround, and sometimes even an abuse report.
- Use a spotter when backing out or driving through tight spots.  No matter how good you think you are, you're not.
- Clean it.  Inside and out.  That shit be nasty sometimes.

The site isn't pulling up correctly so I decided to copy and paste.  I always give this to new airmen coming into my shop.  These tips can help you go a long way, just don't come across to your supervisors as a kiss ass.

* If someone makes more money than you; call them Sir/Ma’am, Sergeant, or by their operating initials if performing ATC (Air Traffic Control) duty
* Remember a Chief is always a CHIEF, no operating initials!
* If you're not listening or working in a position, always have an ATC publication open in front of you.
* Never refuse to do a chow run.
* Never get visibly or noticeably upset when asked to do clean up or weeds and seeds.
* Never get visibly or noticeably upset when someone else gets priority in training over you. Discuss how you feel in private, tactfully, and only with you supervisor.
* Whenever you are the ""new"" person in an ATC facility; keep to yourself for the first few weeks and get a feel for those you will be working with and for before you start running your mouth. Don't try to be ""one of the guys"" right away.
* Take pride in your uniform and never be a duffel bag (wearing your uniform like a sack).
* Try to be the first to show up for work and the last to leave (don't be a 45er).
* If you are going to be late; call first and always bring doughnuts (do not make showing up late for work a habit).
* If you don't have INTEGRITY get some real quick.
* Keep track of all your accomplishments throughout the year and provide this list to your supervisor when it comes time to write your EPR.
* Volunteer for additional duties and projects to the extent possible (remember your training comes first though).
* Start going to school as soon as you can (take CLEP and DANTES tests if you are unable to take classes).
* Serve at least one overseas tour before you decide to get out of the military.
* Learn anything the Air Force is willing to teach you for free.
* Take pride in your profession and never bad mouth it while you are still receiving a paycheck.
* Learn as much about YOUR entitlements and benefits.
* When in doubt, SALUTE.
* Never try to duck away, or hide during RETREAT.
* Find someone in your organization whom you admire or who has their act together and try to emulate that person to the extent possible without losing sight of your own identity.
* Have confidence in yourself and always try to exceed standards (go above and beyond what's expected).
* Don't keep secrets from your supervisor, make them feel comfortable knowing you will come to them with problems.
*Remember a chain has many links when using the chain of command.
* Finally, if you need advice go to someone who has or is succeeding; don't get it from those who are failing.
* Note:  There is a lot of truth in these 25 comments, having learned 80% for err.  ATC can be replaced with anything, and the picture still remains.

I would consider B to have been a very close friend while we were growing up, we were best friends in high school and went through a lot together. 

So B and I have a week full of sex. Freakin' passionate, amazing sex. He got me on base twice, and he stayed at my house (dumb, dumb, dumb in hindsight). We communicated often when he left, and I flew out to see him in April. I have tickets to go on a trip and see him in August as well. 

Today I found his joint Facebook account with his wife. I feel so naive. I completely trusted him. I trusted that he had a sense of honor and dignity. And his poor wife... The more I'm digging, the sadder I feel for her. 

So now what? Tell him that I know? Tell her? Ask my ""friend"" why on earth he lied? Will B get in trouble with the Air Force? What he did is awful, but I don't want to jeopardize what he's worked hard for career wise.

We don't know the answers to your obscure medical questions. We aren't doctors.

Yes, if you did hardcore drugs above trying marijuana a few times, you are disqualified.

No, we don't know what jobs are available at any given time, or your chances of getting said job, or how long it will take for you to get the job, or how long it'll take for you to get to basic training.

Yes, some recruiters are lazy. Keep hounding them or find another recruiter.

Being a pilot is hard. Most of them come from the Air Force Academy, then ROTC. Very few slots available for OTS. Highly competitive.

If someone with more stripes than myself asks me to do something i will do it, even if i know they're wrong just to be respectful and avoid confrontation. I'm bald so i wear hats a pretty much all of the time out of uniform to avoid sunburn and sometimes forget to remove it before entering the chow hall. Usually noone really says anything but today a young E-1 in the marines came up to me and started ripping my asshole up saying there is an ""Air Force Directive"" or something about not wearing hats in the chow hall. I took off my hat and told him to fuck off not because he ""corrected"" me but because of the rude manner in which he decided to do so. So this sparked a question in my mind. Is there an actual AFI stating you can't wear hats while in a DFAC in civilian attire? Or is it just common courtesy? I don't have a problem taking my hat off in a chow hall, i'm just curious if he is full of shit because I've been searching for the last little bit and can't find anything stating explicitly that it is not allowed (some bases have specific policies but the one in which im stationed does not) and in our local chow hall the signs stating the dress code doesn't mention hats at all. I'm sure i seem like one of those confrontational guys at this point but i'm just sorta curious really. Any links anyone has on the subject would be cool so next time someone tries to pull a non-existent AFI out of their ass i can at least tell them they're wrong before I take my hat off out of courtesy.

Disclaimer-If i was an English major i wouldn't have enlisted so apologies in advances for any grammar/spelling errors.

(edit) I still haven't really received anything backing up the young marine. I'm aware it is common courtesy and if you read the above explanation you'll see i have no problem removing my hat. This particular chow hall has no postings saying otherwise like i have seen in the past on other bases.

Personally, the only for-profit school I have tried is American Military University (which is part of American Public University System).  AMU is a regionally accredited.

I already have an Associates from a state university (UVU for reference) so I'm just looking to take classes towards my bachelors.  A lot of credits that I had (over 130 hours worth) did not transfer to some of the requirements for AMU.  As it stands, I'll have to repeat a history class and a few others.  Also, I had to take some garbage 'online learning' class where the textbook was some lame self-help book.  The only other class I took through them was Environmental Economics.  Honestly, I thought that the class was good, the text-book was good, but the professor graded all of us really easy.  I turned in an 8 page paper for a 10 page assignment, and still got 100%  

As it stands, I'll probably continue going there simply because they take my TA and they worked very well with me while I was deployed.

Who is going where?  What has your experience been?  Do you feel that you are getting an education for your money?  These companies are eating up our TA; we owe it to ourselves and our fellow airmen to make informed decisions about who is getting rich off our benefits.

EDIT: Shame on me for putting 'Airforce'.  10 hail mary's, 10 hello dolly's... got it.

EDIT 2: I don't want this to become a total circle-jerk, so feel free to put your gritty opinion on the institution--no one benefits if we all rave about everywhere.  Try to avoid too many acronyms--I know it sucks to type out the name, but we'll all benefit from less abbreviation.  Also, put the level of accreditation the school has, and maybe link it for everyone else?

I’ll try to summarize. I was in for 4 years as [5R051](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/airforceenlistedjobs/a/afjob5r0x1.htm) Got out on good terms, (which is a huge regret in my life) graduated college and realized how much I miss the military life. Like how I volunteered to deploy twice! So anyway, I tried the Army in July 2012. They medically processed me and had me retake the ASVAB. Then they told me they didn’t have a guaranteed job choice after basic training so I said “No”.


I then spoke to an Air Force recruiter in early September. I tried in the past and I was told air force wasn’t taking prior service so I checked every fiscal year or so. This time we started the paperwork. I wrote a letter of why I want to be in the Air force etc. I still had and supplied all my firewall 5 EPRs. My personal record is STILL clean, financially, criminally, and no tattoos.



I was told I’ve have to retrain so I had to retake the ASVAB a second time and after taking 4 weeks to study I got a 78 for contracting, which I guess was open at the time. We then found out that I couldn’t retrain and I would have to go in with my old job which made the second ASVAB testing I just took kind of a waste of time?
My recruiter then submitted all my paperwork to the squadron level. They needed a wavier because my 6 year mark would be up (Nov 18th 2012) which is the limit of being out of the Air force to get back in. This was around early November by the way. My recruiter was awesome enough to write a wavier and re-submit it. It got approved and sent to AFRS HQ.
~~                                                                                                                                              ~~

AFRS denied my request because of the 6 year waiver, my AFSC isn’t critically manned, and I can’t retrain for some reason? (Something about needing to be in the reserves in the past two years?) So basically, it took 20 weeks with *several* checks and balances along the way…… to get denied. Hopes of fixing my regret………crushed…… 


**TL;DR** Took 20 weeks of hoop jumping and waiting to get denied joining the world’s greatest Air Force at the *last* step..


Those currently serving – Be grateful to be part of such an awesome service! And thank you for sticking with it!

The guys scored in the 90's but failed to meet the minimum in one of the components. My understanding is that those who score an ""excellent"" on the PT Test are in the top 10% of the air force in terms of physical fitness, yet people are being denied orders/written referal EPR's because the air force lacks common sense. 

I know people will say ""well he should have prepared for the test"" and I get that. But it really seems like the air force is being hard headed on this one. I love the idea of testing twice a year.

I am currently in the top 3-ish people in the career field in terms of knowledge and skill (calculated thusly: Everyone in our career field falls under the same majcom, majcom consistently praises our shop as the best in the AF, I am the third-best in the shop, mostly due to time on station.  The other 2 have been here longer.)~~

~~I'm being discharged for PT failure, mostly due to my lack of preparation, partially due to injury and environment (you never fully adjust to high altitude, they can shove that one up their asses.)  I (and others) believe my leaving the AF will be a major detriment to the success of the mission at our base.~~  

***Objectively speaking (please no PT chest-thumping), do you think retention should be weighted equally in regards to fitness and job ability?***

~~Addendum: Before anyone brings up readiness requirements, our job is no longer deployable, anywhere.  We are all coded as deployed-in-place.  Also manning across all shops that do our job is terrible, so nobody is PCSing.~~

~~Addendum #2:  I neglected to include an example of what I'm referring to.  My supervisor, a SSgt with 8 or 9 years TIS (the sole reason he made rank was because the test was PDG-only that year) is incompetent in most aspects of our job.  We routinely correct him and pick up his slack, and running the issue up the chain doesn't help.  Unfortunately for us, he scores well on his fitness evaluations, so he keeps his job.  I feel this is an imbalance and weakens us all.~~

EDIT:  Ok, so this has devolved into exactly what I didn't want it to be.  There has been minimal discussion about the question asked in the title, lots of PT chest-thumping, and a lot of reinforcing my theory that the mission has taken a back seat (demonstrated by comments like ""If you can't meet standards you are not good at your job.  Period"").  I appreciate you all for illustrating that the ""disregard question and instead run my mouth"" attitude is not isolated to some of the people I work with, and is instead AF-wide, thus reinforcing how delighted I am to be leaving the AF.
