In addition to the numerous in-person parties to watch the Curiosity landing, there are several places to watch online:

* [USTREAM: NASAJPL](http://www.ustream.tv/nasajpl) 

* [USTREAM: NASA TV](http://www.ustream.tv/nasahdtv)

* [NASA.gov: NASA TV](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html)

I'm trying to collect some useful information and will update here:

* [NASA Mission pages for Mars Science Laboratory](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/) which has a countdown clock until time of landing.

* /u/zero_dogg has created a [permatime link](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/xpsfj/the_official_rnasa_curiosity_landing_thread/c5olni8) that will show you when the landing is scheduled in your timezone.

* /u/songkran [clarifies what we'll be seeing](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/xpsfj/the_official_rnasa_curiosity_landing_thread/c5okanz). **If you're asking what you'll be seeing, you should read this post. You won't see a movie-type live video of  Curiosity actually landing, unfortunately.**

* The closest we can get to actually ""seeing"" what happens live is to use the live view of the [Eyes on the Solar System simulator](http://eyes.nasa.gov/)

* Here's a [timeline for the events](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/msl-what-to-expect-on-sunday-night) (appears to be in PDT) from someone blogging at JPL.

* /u/workman161 has set up an IRC channel [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23curiosity), and /u/JacWHB has set up an IRC channel [here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=RedditCuriosityLanding) for folks who want to chat in real-time during the landing.

**Edit 1**: Corrected GMT landing time.

**Edit 2**: Tried to answer the FAQ of ""what will we be seeing"". Added link to MSL timeline via IEEE

**Edit 3**: Added info about IRC channels",,False,self,t5_2qk6m,1344223734.0,,,True,t3_xpsfj,http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/xpsfj/the_official_rnasa_curiosity_landing_thread/,moderator

""To all employees:

Congress just passed a law that bars NASA, National Science Foundation, Department of Commerce, and Department of Justice from buying IT systems that have been ""produced, manufactured or assembled"" by companies ""owned, operated or subsidized"" in any way by the Chinese. The only exceptions to this rule are for hardware that is deemed to be in the interests of national security, or if the FBI decides that a component¹s acquisition does not carry any risk of ""cyber-espionage or sabotage.""   While Goddard is working out processes to handle this legislation, the direction from Goddard's Chief Information Officer is that no IT products shall be purchased at this time, via P-card of any other mechanism.  This applies to hardware, software and maintenance, and to both civil servant and contractor purchases.  

Your cooperation is appreciated.   We'll inform you when we have further guidelines from the Center.""

I applied because this opportunity seemed interesting and I definitely fit well within what they were looking for. Nonetheless, I feel like the area I will be working in is a bit out of my head and I can't find much resources to learn about these.

I don't even know how much they want me to know before even starting but I think its a good idea to go into the interview with some knowledge.

This is what the background information reads.

&gt;The Ground Systems Engineering section (393) is improving the capture of processes and products involved in developing and deploying mission operations systems (MOS) and ground data systems (GDS) for many of JPL’s flight missions. This includes approaches such as developing web-based resources as well as expanding the use of model-based systems engineering (MBSE.)

And the project description.

&gt;Create a Ground System knowledge inventory (Body of Knowledge) and training-related items. This will be done by eliciting information from subject matter experts in interviews, electronic references, etc. The Body of knowledge will be made accessible using techniques such as model-based engineering, wikis, etc. The task may also include creating model components and views using the MagicDraw tool and improvements to the user interface with, and output products from, the project model.

Any help in understanding these concepts, how they relate to space flight, and exactly what I will be expected to do?

General interview tips would also be appreciated for something like this. It will most likely be over Skype or telephone and I can't imagine not nervously and frantically walking around.

I agree with you that NASA's space programs serve to inspire many Americans, especially our students.
 
NASA has a proud history of accomplishments and is clearly the world's leader in space research. The agency has a bright future in pursuing the many challenges of space exploration in the next century.
 
As you know, NASA believes that a concentrated international effort is the best way to leverage U.S. funding for many very costly scientific projects. The International Space Station is at the focus of this approach to space science and exploration. While I support the mission of the International Space Station, it is also important that this research facility be developed in a manner that is respectful of those who are paying for it, the American taxpayers.
 
One of the ways NASA can offset costs and maximize project benefits is to more aggressively facilitate the commercial use of the Space Station's assets. In the past I have supported legislation to permit and encourage corporate participation to the maximum extent possible. By involving the private sector in the Station's operations, the American public will be able to benefit sooner from the results of the research that will be conducted on the Station.
 
I have also worked to impose a price cap on the development costs of the International Space Station. A price cap would have placed funding constraints on the program and motivated NASA to be more resourceful with their budgeting. I do not think this is unreasonable, given NASA's claims of being creative and innovative.
 
Please be assured I will continue to work with NASA to ensure that the International Space Station is both fiscally responsible and produces the best possible scientific research. Thank you again for contacting me on this issue.
 
 
Sincerely,
John McCain
United States Senator

A NASA PAC!.

A Political Action Committee to champion the causes of NASA in particular and Science in general in both the government and legislative arenas. Think about this for a moment. A lobbying organization similar to the ones for political groups. Or the ""pro or anti"" groups for the many public arguments about personal weaponry, abortion and religion, industries and the environment. Only this one will push NASA's interest!

Among some of the things it could pull off:

* 1) Lobby for an amendment to place NASA beyond the political-vagaries of each election-cycle by fixing NASA's funding to a level pegged to the national-budget or the GDP, hopefully voiding further-use of NASA as a political-football. More importantly, this gives NASA credibility, confidence, and the ability to design and execute real (and not just notional) long-range and even multi-decadal plans and missions which are a necessity in aeronautical-research and space-exploration.

* 2) Lobby for relaxing any prohibitions that prevent NASA from self-promotion. This could help set the record straight in so many ways and in so many places. Helping debunk the many urban legends and myths that surround NASA and it's accomplishments. And besides, as we can see from all the 'disavowed' political ads this time of year, the PAC itself could promote NASA's accomplishments, no law against that!

* 3) Sponsor legislators that are pro NASA and/or pro Science. Dispel untruths or half truths about NASA used in the political arena by politicians against each other.

* 4) Promote NASA in other ways that NASA cannot itself do.

* 5) It can be a  powerful 3 or 4 way interface between public, government, NASA, and maybe even industy.

I am, admittedly, not a well-connected political-operator type that can organize or run or admin a PAC. I'm more the t-shirt wearing activist type. I'll volunteer! NASA themselves can't do it without, I'm sure, breaking some law or other.

So I'm putting it out there for people to consider and maybe **someone** more creditable will think it's a good idea as well and **run with it**. As for me, I think it's too important an idea to be selfish about.

PACs are pretty much self sustaining. Operating cash comes (popular causes generates a lot [mountains] of money!) from the folks that are like-minded. But connectedness and deep pockets are required to get the ball rolling.

If you wish, read my submissions to NASA's 'solicitation for public comment' for further radical ideas regarding NASA at http://blog.chino.com/ If you ""don't disagree"" with the concepts in my submissions (or even if you do :-), I'd appreciate if you re-post or share the blog. We could use more vocality on this side of the argument!

Please, let me know if am I just blowing smoke, or if reddit thinks this is a valid idea that I should continue to push.

... imagine, one day we might even see TV ads like: 
""Do you want to see us continue to spend more money 
funding the same old tired wars? Or do you want us to
explore the Solar System‽. 
Call and tell your congress-person NOW!""... 
... and at the bottom of the screen, the names and telephone numbers of the local congressional reps slowly crawls by...  *",,False,self,t5_2qk6m,1345260865.0,,,True,t3_yev9r,http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/yev9r/what_does_reddit_think_of_a_political_action/,

We have seen NASA's budget being cut for the past few years, but all the talk in Congress that I can find is that NASA *should not* be cut. 

Does anyone have any articles / congressional committee hearings talking about why NASA's budget SHOULD be cut? 

Thank you very much! I appreciate the help.",,False,self,t5_2qk6m,False,,,True,t3_1cjorr,http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/1cjorr/why_is_nasas_budget_being_cut/,

When I was a little kid (this would be like 1983 or so? I'm not sure?) I got a mail-order kit thing (I think?) with some stuff for the Space Shuttle. Amongst the schwag was an album, like ... used with a record player ... which to my recollection had some information shit on one side and some music on the other. I'm really not certain.

Anyway, I am sure that the album (again, a record, like with needle and speaker) had an illustration of the space shuttle on it, and it was mostly blue. It was like clear plastic with the picture underneath. And I remember this song

""Ko lum bee ah! Sail on the ocean of our dreams Carry us to the stars""

What I really want is the song. But any other information, including where/when this thing came from, would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: RE: Apollo 11 Landing on the Moon

Xxxx,

Great film, and very well done. And thanks for the compliment on my participation in getting the sound on this film!!! I am sure you didn’t know, but here is the rest of the story:

Within a day or two after the mission, there was a very serious concern over Aldrin’s comment about dust being kicked up by the decent engine plume.

(102:45:17 GET - LMP (Buzz Aldrin)
40 feet, down 2 1/2. Kicking up some dust.)

Although you begin to see dust being blown away at about 100 ft. altitude, Buzz didn’t mention it until about 40 ft. It is obvious by looking at the film with the sound track that it wasn’t much of a problem, but at the time, no one could sync up the film with the timeline and voice, because there was no time reference on the film. Since Buzz was totally busy with the landing, he couldn’t be sure exactly when he saw the dust. Our top management was looking at a silent film with no time reference, and the crew was trying to explain how well they could see surface features, created a problem that needed better information.  Although the crew said it was not a problem for them, there was a legitimate concern that on later flights, it could be worse due to different surface or lighting conditions, obscuring the crews vision at a critical time during the landing.

At that time, I worked in the Apollo Program Office, Systems Engineering Division with Xxxx Xxxxxx who was the Apollo 11 Mission Staff Engineer, a job that made him responsible for everything on that mission, and for resolving miscellaneous problems that arose that didn’t seem to belong to anyone else. It was a good job, because it got me a console in one of the back rooms of Mission Control during all the Apollo missions.  Since I was the assistant, we discussed the problem. Without knowing that there was no time reference, I asked him why the film lab couldn’t put the audio on the film so we could get a realistic view of how bad the dust was at lower altitudes. He said that they had already tried that, but the film lab said it was impossible to match up the sound with the picture accurately without the time reference. There was a good time hack when the camera was turned on, but stretch in the film by the time of the landing caused an error at touchdown of several minutes. I think that has been corrected now, because the video we see seems to be correctly synced at the beginning and touchdown.

Since I personally knew and often worked with some of people in the film lab, I took the challenge to work out the problem with them. When they processed a test film, everything had to be correct, or they would not release it for use. When I found out that they had no way of detecting when the landing pads hit the surface, I volunteered to give them that time hack. Even though the film would be out of sync at the beginning of descent by several minutes, I convinced them that was not a problem as long as we synced it up pretty well at touchdown. Knowing the length of the pole mounted contact switch and the descent rate, it was easy to select a point on the film that coincided with touchdown.

Once we looked at the film as you see it now, Apollo management discarded engine blown dust as a concern and went on with the other six missions.

Please don’t believe that I am telling this story because of my excessive appreciation of my cleverness. I hope you are interested in the quirky issues that came up almost daily, and how we bulldozed our way through them. This was one that required no mathematical genius to resolve, but a high degree of confidence and determination to resolve a psychological problem with fellow engineers, and get one of the most important test films in history released for use. 

Now about the film, I think it is outstanding!!! Especially with both the crew voice and Flight Control voice provided. I am very impressed recalling how calm the crew and flight controllers were able to talk business during this most critical time of the mission. Remember Charlie Dukes often quoted comment after the first call from the crew after landing:

102:46:06 GET - CAPCOM (Charlie Duke)
Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.

Compare this with the nonchalant atmosphere of the control room for the recent Mars  rover Curiosity landing. http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/multimedia/video-view.cfm?Vid_ID=1823

I guess this defines one of the biggest differences between being a spectator in the unmanned flight control room and a participant in a manned flight control room, and the differences in skill level required.

If you buy me a beer sometime, I’ll tell you about the Apollo spacecraft design error that I alone discovered,  and came up with the redesign that saved the Apollo program from a very highly probable earth entry disaster. This would have cost us not only that crew, but any chance of landing on the moon within the time limit.

Imagine what would happen if NASA was crowdfunded by the internet?

How much would you give?

Arguably most space program enthusiasts are internet savvy, so this would potentially serve as a way of humanity to get into space without having to rely on shortsighted governments.

Think bigger than NASA, this would be an international project. Anyone on earth who has some money to spare would be able to PAY to enable our species to explore space. 

Using Kickstarter as an example, a watch concept had $7 Million dollars pledged to it, a Computer Game had $3 Million. What would happen if this was something that actually mattered?

Here's how it works: If you'd like to have flair associated with your name here:

1) Send an email to nasa.reddit@gmail.com from your NASA email address with your Reddit username

2) Send a message to the mods via mod mail from your reddit account so that we'll know there's email waiting. Please **do not** include your email address in the mod mail message.

3) One of the mods will respond once we've enabled your flair.

Please let us know if you're an employee or contractor so that we can set up the flair as appropriate. We've also got a few other types of flair for different job titles that we're going to experiment with, so if you can figure out a way to verify to us what your job is, we could use one of those instead. (Any astronauts out there?)

Obviously this is optional so if you'd prefer not to do it, that's fine too. If you've got problems with the verification process, message the mods and I'm sure we can figure out something.

It was very enjoyable, but focused mostly on the astronauts, very little on rocketry, science or technology.

I also rented From the Earth to the Moon, but it seems to be a dramatization of the Mercury-Apollo missions with more recent interviews, and that is not what I'm looking for either.

Does anyone know of a documentary (long-form preferably) that covers spaceflight or the moon landings from more of a scientific angle?

Thanks for the recommendations!

I am trying to find a person from the NASA (probably from the public relations department or ISS public relations department), I have a question I need to ask.
I have a hobby that, as I think, is useful for education and presentation purposes. And the result is beautiful, again as I see it.

So, we (that is, my wife and I)  are doing virtual tours. It’s not just a set of panoramas - we are using panoramas to show and describe to the visitors what they are actually looking at. I am doing that because of curiosity - we’re curious to get into unusual places, find something interesting there and bring it out to the internet. For example, we’ve done a number of such tours inside the plane cockpits and asked people whose job is related to aviation and particular aircrafts to describe things that the visitor may see in the panoram.

Here are some links to the tours we’ve made:
[Planes](http://perfectumlab.com/gallery/panorams/tours/ac_rossiya/?l=en) (select plane, select location in the plane, see descriptions).
[A Tank](http://perfectumlab.com/gallery/panorams/tours/military/t80bv/?lang=en).
[And all other things we have](http://perfectumlab.com/en/page/panoramas).

So, my question to the person I'll probably find is: would NASA like to do a great-looking and informative virtual tour on the ISS?

As PineappleMeinster pointed it out, there already is a tour on the ISS. I believe it could be done more thoroughly, remastered with modern technologies, another approach and so on...

Could you please help me (if you like the idea, of course) and send the link to this post to anyone who may be like the person I am looking for? Or post/pm me a contact point to that person, I’ll try to chase him or her.

And yes, I'd tried other ways. I posted my question in twitter to almost all NASA accounts, wrote to the emails shared on the official site and posted question to the site.

Thank you for reading.

I'm currently working on a project as a senior in aerospace engineering, and I wanted reddit's opinion on something:

Let's imagine a hypothetical scenario where NASA is heading to the moon this summer. If you could design any experiment, and money isn't an option, what would you do? In other words, what experiment do you think is worthy of going to the moon for? Drilling for core samples? Collecting solar energy and trying to transmit it with superconductors? What do you think?

Just let me know and I'll move it, but I thought this might be an okay place to start.

A little background, I'm actually a mechanical engineering master's student with about 1 year work experience in manufacturing polycarbons. So not exactly what people are looking for. However, despite that and the fact that my school offers literally no classes in aerospace design or anything related to that (we get to learn HVAC yay!)  I have a really big interest in space/astronomy and pretty much everything related to it.

I feel like either I need experience in the field or I need classes relating to the field in order to be taken seriously while applying to companies.

So really I guess my question for anyone who has literally any input is how should I go about getting into this field (not NASA specifically but any company in this field) without getting immediately turned down?  

TLDR: ME grad (masters degree), no experience in the field, no classes in the field, but a great interest in this stuff. PLZ HALP ME ON MY WAY TO GET JOB!!!  

edit: I don't mean to sound needy or entitled or anything, I'd actually be willing to take more school if that's what I need to do, I'd just rather not as I already have this degree and a fair amount of debt to go with it

2.	Approximately how long have you been working in the aerospace industry?

3.	Are you currently working on any particular NASA project?

Just six months ago, we were at around 1,100 subscribers, and as I write this, we're at over 6,200 Flightless Astronauts and climbing. Thanks to everyone for contributing.

As we've grown, we've also matured, and the mods have come up with  a few new rules that we want to make sure everyone understands. We've posted them in the sidebar, but here they are:

* No memes
* No rage comics
* No image macros
* No affiliate links
* No begging for upvotes

We're not trying to stifle humor or creativity, but we'd like to keep our content relevant, and we don't want to have things turn into a free-for-all. We don't think that any of these rules should be an issue, and we hope you won't either. To make the transition smoother, we've decided to ""grandfather"" *most* of the existing posts that would otherwise violate these rules, since they weren't in place at the time of the posting. (We reserve the right to be totally arbitrary about this.) If you really have an issue with something we deleted or left, send a message to the mods and we can discuss it. 

We'd also like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that if you work for NASA, you can have flair associate with your user name. The information on how to do that is on the sidebar, or you can see a more detailed explanation in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/nz0xx/work_for_nasa_want_flair_keep_reading/).

1317153219.0,13,self.nasa,kta5k,Wanted: somebody who works at NASA Goddard and can give a group of Redditors a tour there.,segers909,19,6,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/kta5k/wanted_somebody_who_works_at_nasa_goddard_and_can/,"Hello :)  
So here's the story: I'm an 18 year old Belgian student with a love for spaceflight. A couple of weeks ago, I booked a flight to the US. During my one week stay, I'll visit Orlando and DC. I choose DC because it has both the Air and Space museum and the Goddard Space Center. I was arranging a tour at the Goddard Space Center via email with the visitor center there, and everything seemed fine. They informed me that I'll need a group of at least 8 people to get a tour, so I posted a request here on Reddit and got lots of participants: me and my friend included we're with 10. Then the problems started.  
In the first email I received from the Visitor center, it stated:
 &gt; The Visitor Center itself is open to the public Tuesdays through   Fridays from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm, and Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 4:00 pm. 

I (incorrectly) assumed that these where the hours for tours as well. It turns out that tours are only possible tuesdays to fridays and that the last one starts at 1PM. I only arrive in DC on friday 4th of november and my plane lands at 2PM :(  
  
So I tried everything. I tried changing the flight from Orlando to DC, which turns out to be impossible. I suggested to book a new ticket (they where only $60) for a plane that leaves earlier, but it turns out that if I don't show up for my usual plane (the one that lands in DC at 2PM), all my tickets, including my flight back to Belgium, get cancelled.  

The lady at the visitor center was very kind. She tried everything she could to still get me a tour on 3PM, but still had to disappoint me. She said the only option I had left was to find somebody who works there and who is willing to get me a visitors badge. 

So I once again turn to Reddit for help. If you work at Goddard and think you can help me, please leave a comment. If you could spend a couple of hours, ideally on saturday 4th of november but friday 3 or 4PM is fine too, I'd be extremely grateful. I'd be willing to pay for it, too. And I can bring you a giant box of Belgian chocolates. :)  

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and if you have any thoughts / ideas I'd love to hear them.  

**TL;DR: I'd love a tour at Goddard, but due to an error on my part I'll only be there outside the official tour hours. If you work there and can give me (and preferably 8 other redditors) a visitorsbadge/tour, I'd be extreme thankful.**",,False,self,t5_2qk6m,True,,,True,t3_kta5k,http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/kta5k/wanted_somebody_who_works_at_nasa_goddard_and_can/,

The conferences that we go to also offer Crisis Committees, which are much more fast pace and interactive.  They are also usually based on historic events.  I signed up for a council about the space race at the Michigan State University annual conference.  Everybody in the committee was portraying a real person.  I got somebody whom you've probably never heard of.  His name was William McChesney Martin.  He was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve from FDR to Nixon.  Other delegates included Buzz Aldrin, John Glenn, Bob Kennedy, the Head of the FBI, and many others.  In another room was the Soviet delegation, working to get their men to the moon before ours.  It truly was a race.  To make things more interesting, we were not required to completely follow historic events.  This allowed us to respond to situations as we saw fit, like we were actually in the Space Race.  And to spice it up even more, we could be influenced by events as they happened.  For example, early on, we witnessed the assassination of JFK.  Our public opinion was greatly affected by goings on in Vietnam.  We were even approached by the Army with a deal to provide them with rocket technology in return for a $5 billion budget.  We decided how the Missile Crisis played out.  One of us was murdered in cold blood by Soviets.  There was even a bomb planted in the room, which we had to defuse.  To top it all off, the Secretary of Sate had been acting as a double agent, pretending to have betrayed us, only to earn the trust of the Soviets, and provide us with information from them.  In the end, we just barely won, and we all breathed a deep sigh of relief.  It seriously felt like we were actually there.  Its an experience I will never forget.  So that's the story of how I, a 15 year old high school student, won the Space Race.

When we first captured a picture of the earth over the moon with one of our satellites, President Johnson said something that inspired me:  ""This is not the earth the way you learned it in school.  This is not a color- coded map; no borders, no labels, nothing.  This is the earth the way it was meant to be seen, and I say...I say, we have just discovered the earth for the very first time.""",,False,self,t5_2qk6m,1369353746.0,,,True,t3_1exs6u,http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/1exs6u/i_am_a_15_year_old_high_school_student_and_this/,

If you allow me to expose my point of view, please understand that I'm not being judgemental or have any kind of agenda. I, for one, would be willing to make donations to NASA on a regular basis. But I am not American and NASA﻿ is not a NGO, quite the opposite.

What would change if NASA became part of UN, for instance? They could even keep the name, as far as I'm concerned. Or change it to EASA, that would be neat.

Anyway, the point is, being no longer attached to a specific country (but still being able to receive investments from it, of course), new sources of income could take place.

Of course, I'm a foreigner, I'm not American, but NASA was﻿ behind my dreams as much as any other person's who responded vividly ""An astronaut!"" when was questioned ""What will you be when you grow up?"" as a kid.

This is something that could only come from the﻿ people who created it, and no one else has even the right to ask for it. What I'm saying is that we, the rest of the world, would like to have that responsibility upon us as well.

It's the best way, I believe, we could say thanks.",,False,self,t5_2qk6m,False,,,True,t3_xruz2,http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/xruz2/my_thoughts_on_nasa_as_a_world_agency/,

- The bulk of it was reusable, with only the comparatively cheap and easy to build ET being lost after every flight.

- It provided a modular, highly customizable and flexible heavy lift platform that could be used in a multitude of different ways (You can do spacelab on a shuttle, and I can't help but feel that repairing the Hubble would have been a pain in the ass for something like an Apollo -style CM/SM setup.

- It had an excellent safety record, marred mostly by human procedural error, not design flaws (For example, there were concerns over Columbia's foam strike, but NASA officials wouldn't allow for the issue to be pursued further)

- It's fucking cool, and is a symbol for the nation.

The shuttle needed retirement, if I'm not mistaken it served longer than just about any launch system.  But, with everything learned from the first shuttle program, I'd imagine building a vastly improved one would be feasible and more importantly, a better course of action than the current route.

Just asking because I'm working on a small project of how the website works and reads.

What I would like to know is how you guys navigate it. The first thing you look at to the information you dismiss. Just in the index page.  Since the index does have an overwhelming amount of information that's displayed at once.

I know that the runway it will use is currently unknown, but am very curious about which direction it will be coming from.

The reason is because I work just north of Dulles, and am literally as close to the airport as possible (the only thing separating my building from the airport grounds is a drainage ditch and the Dulles Greenway), about 1/4 of a mile from one of the four runways and 3/4 from another (which happen to be the two longest runways) and about 1.5 miles from the third (the third-longest runway).

I am debating whether or not I run out and get a video camera, but don't want to spend the money if I am on the wrong side of it (and with two-mile-long runways, being on the wrong side means I'll see nothing instead of everything head-on or from the side).

At the same time, if it were coming in from the east or west, that narrows the runway down significantly (and again means I see nothing).

Any info is appreciated! I realize that the flight plan is being kept pretty quiet (security is a concern), but if there are any strong speculations, even that would be useful to know.

Currently, I only have one school and one NASA program, and that is Penn State. There is a professor there that has conducted physiology research with astronauts.

Hacker and James M. Grimwood. We are reading one chapter a week, with each chapter discussion kicking off on Sunday, usually in the afternoon for those in the Americas.

Each chapter will have it's own discussion thread which links to the online copy of that chapter. The book is also available in various formats at the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19780012208) . I recommend the PDF version for both computer and Kindle reading. The .mobi version is of poor quality and the online version lacks some of the pictures. Also, the footnotes are much more readable in a format with actual pages.

As of today (September 2, 2012), we have just started on Chapter 2, ""The Transmutation of Mercury"".

Listed and linked below are the discussion threads for the individual chapters.

###Discussions:

1. [Chapter 1, ""Between Mercury and Apollo""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/yvpvc/rnasa_bookclub_on_the_shoulders_of_giants_chapter/)

2. [Chapter 2, ""The Transmutation of Mercury""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/z8vb5/rnasa_book_club_on_the_shoulders_of_titans_a/)

3. [Chapter 3, ""From Spacecraft to Project""](http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/zmrd6/rnasa_bookclub_on_the_shoulders_of_titans_a/)

Updates to follow. Feedback is welcome.

*Note to current readers: I'm reorganizing things a little bit.

First time poster here, long time lurker. I recently graduated with a bachelors in EE in May, and now work at a defense contractor. I am very into signal processing and communication systems, and have an opportunity to work on a lot of really cool and cutting-edge research in the field currently. I have always been an avid follower and deep admirer of NASA and the work they do to contribute to the betterment of humanity. The MSL project has me extremely excited about what we can accomplish in the future.

My question to you all is, is there a lot of signal processing type work that goes on at NASA, or is it largely contracted out? I would love to work at NASA some day, and really just want to find out more about the kind of signal processing stuff that happens at NASA.

Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2qk6m,False,,,True,t3_mb4x5,http://www.reddit.com/r/nasa/comments/mb4x5/signal_processing_at_nasa/,
