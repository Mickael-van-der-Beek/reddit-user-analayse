I have been renting a ground level suite on a 1 year lease, which is about to become a month-to-month lease. She insists that she can now give me 30 day notice to vacate without any reason (such as late payment or excessive damage, etc). 

From what I've read online and in the BC Tenancy Act, a landlord must have CAUSE to evict a resident. It does not specify if this applies to both term leases and month-to-month leases.  

She wants to add ""landlord has right to give 30 day notice to vacate"" on the new lease, and I don't want to sign a contract that I believe to be 'illegal' and non enforceable. 

I'm looking for local common knowledge and personal experiences with this issue. I've only been living in BC for a year so I'm not sure if this is normal or totally wrong. 

Thanks for your help guys!

38 seats for the Liberals
34 for NDP,
7 for the Greens
4 for the Conservatives
2 for the Independents.

This means no one gets a majority, which would result in a coalition government, but more importantly shows how inaccurate the FPP system is in reflecting what the electorate actually looks like. One can pretty safely assume the Conservatives would join with the Liberals, and the Greens with the NDP. This makes:

Liberal/Conservative coalition: 42 (1 short of majority)
NDP/Green coalition: 41 (2 short of a majority)
Independent: 2

This election would literally come down to which side the independents join. First of all, how much more exciting is that? Secondly, the FPP system is pretty clearly a poor system. Why is it that 8% of people vote green, and then only get 1 seat (1.1% of seats) in Victoria? Why is it that the 44%, a minority of people, that voted Liberal get 59% of the seats and now make all the decisions for the next 4 years? This seems unfair to 58% (a majority) of people that didn't want a Liberal government. Just sayin'.

EDIT:

Just so everyone's clear, you can find the BC-STV system here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC-STV

I would propose a less complicated, but similar system. This alternative would be the following:

Each district has 10 seats in it (for this example), like the BC-STV. However, the seats are not determined by ranking the candidates that you want.

Instead, when the voter goes to the booth the ballot is presented to him with which party he/she wants to vote for across the top of the ballot. You simply check the box for which party you want to win the election.

Beneath each party would be an optional section where, should you choose, you can vote for a candidate you want to have a seat. The party will have chosen people for that riding already, and you get to vote for which one you want to have a seat. The ballot would like as follows, where the # below represents a persons name. The X where this individual voted.


Liberal [X] | NDP [ ] | Green [ ] | Conservative [ ] 
              |            |              |
#1 [ ]      |#1 [ ]    |#1 [ ]      |#1 [ ]
#2 [ ]      |#2 [ ]    |#2 [ ]      |#2 [ ]
#3 [X]      |#3 [ ]    |#3 [ ]      |#3 [ ]
#4 [ ]      |#4 [ ]    |#4 [ ]      |#4 [ ]
#5 [ ]      |#5 [ ]    |#5 [ ]      |#5 [ ]
#6 [ ]      |#6 [ ]    |#6 [ ]      |#6 [ ]


The first thing counted would be the number of votes for each party. These would be tallied and then put into % for each party.

So hypothetically:

42% Liberal
38% NDP
10% Green
10% Conservative

This would directly determine the % of seats for each party. SO;

4 seats for Liberals
4 for the NDP
1 for Green
1 for Conservative

OK, great, now to determine the candidates that take each seat for each party. We'll use the Liberals as an example.

Liberals fielded 6 candidates. The first person to get a seat is the Liberal candidate who received the highest amount of votes from the ballots. The second highest gets the next seat, etc. Should there be a tie or no votes for the remaining candidates, the party will have predetermined the order that the candidates get a seat - this is the order that appears on the ballot.

Boom. Just as easy as the FPP system, but with the option to be more specific as to which candidate you want. And is much more accurate as a representation of the electorate.

The more seats you have in a district, the more accurate you can be % of votes --&gt; # of seats for each party. If you want to keep out small extreme parties, all you have to do is adjust the number of seats to set a % a party needs to obtain to get a seat. In this example, with 10 seats in a district, you could need a minimum of 5.01% to get a seat - the number rounds to the nearest 10. Personally, I think 10 works because it allows for diversity without a crippling number of parties.",,False,self,t5_2qnc6,1368669980.0,,,True,t3_1eddmo,http://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1eddmo/we_need_to_start_talking_about_a_proportional/,

I know this isn't what you guys might typically do in this subreddit, but I thought I'd ask for any recommendations of great campgrounds. One of my favorites that I go to is banbury green in penticton, beautiful little area right on Skaha lake.

We'd really love somewhere with a lake too.

Any recommendations/ideas are greatly appreciated!",,False,self,t5_2qnc6,False,,,True,t3_1epioz,http://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1epioz/looking_for_the_highest_recommended_camping/,

I was hoping for some advice; suggestions on places to stay along the way, places to avoid. Things to bring that one may overlook. Anything else that could possibly be helpful! 

Also wondering if buying gear here or there would be a better idea? I will be able to make trips to cities around Field, as I'm told its quite a desolate area.

I'm keeping things in mind like, doing the full inspection with the guy watching, adjusting mirrors and heat before i start driving, keeping my hands at 10 and 2, shoulder checks, being very obvious about checking my mirrors and such.

My wife and I will be driving from Vancouver to Calgary over three or four days.  Does anyone have any suggestions on a route to take, sites to see, places to stay, or hikes to do?  I know next to nothing about either city or about the route.  All I know is that we definitely want to go through Glacier National Park.  We'll have a tent with us, and ideally will be sleeping under the stars at least two of those nights. Any information, websites, or forums that you can point me in the direction of would be hugely appreciated.  Thanks guys,

*Edit-- Thank you very much for all the comments.  We're going to do it over four nights and five days, which is the max that we can do.  After looking over the comments below (especially krazykoo), here's what we're thinking:

Day 1: Take the 1 through Hope then the 3 to Manning Park we're we'll camp at Lightning Lakes. (2 hours 45 minutes).

Day 2: Continue on the 3 to the 97 through Princeton and Penticton and spend the night in Kelowna (3 hours 38 minutes)

Day 3: From Kelowna take the 97 to Kamloops and then the 5 to Jasper (8 hours 3 minutes).

Day 4: Spend the day in Jasper and drive to Banff in the afternoon on the 93. 

Day 5: Spend the day in Banff, and drive to Calgary on the 1 (1 hour 35 minutes).  

On day 2, would it be better to drive all the way to Kamloops?  We're planning to camp at Lightning Lakes, Jasper, and Banff.  Since I know nothing except what google or reddit tells me, any suggestions on particular places to camp in those areas?  Any particular hikes?

Lately I have had a really bad case of headaches, which are not migraines, I had to go to ER on Thursday night, I had 2 CT Scans on Friday and Tuesday as well. The good news it they didn't find anything big (no tumor or cancer). However the really bad explosive headaches are still there. I have an appointment with the Neurologist until May 23rd, and the only thing it can make feel good right now is this Percozet (Oxycodone 5mg) medicine which is making me really high all the time, making me unable to go to work, or to do anything basically. And if I don't take his, the headaches become so bad I can't do actually anything (they feel like Cluster headaches or maybe a Neuralgia).

Also my CareCard is still in process so some neurologists decided to cancel my appointment because of this, I called my HR  department today and she told me she sent the letter for my CareCard renovation in the middle of march, so they probably lost my documents or something.  HR had faxed the documents today again, so I will probably have it tomorrow because this is considered an emergency.

My question, if you guys know any doctor that might have an open schedule before may 23rd, or any recommendation at all, anything. Because I am getting really anxious/depressed for this constant headache =(.

I currently live in Vancouver, I am a male 27 years old.

Thank you for your attention,

Major questions about autism services out there for children.,AssNasty,14,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/1ea8aq/planning_on_moving_to_bc_next_year_from/,"Hi, my family and I going to be abandoning our home province for greener pastures out west; if you've ever lived through a Sask winter, I'm sure you can guess why. We were lucky enough to have had our 4 year old severely Autistic boy in a specialized ABA preschool (and afterwards ABA kindergarten) where he is receiving 4 hours of therapy a day. It's towards the lower end of the optimal amount of therapy, but there's no other real option in Sask without forking over 70k for private therapy.

Anyway, long story short as of fall 2014 he will be done with the ABA school (funding issues) and we are planning our move to coincide with elementary school next year. Here are my questions:

I read that the MCFS caps autism funding at $22k a year until age 6. After that it's $6000 a year. How expensive (and accessible) are services out there for autistic kids (i.e. speech and occupational therapy)?

Once in the public school system (Probably fall 2014), if he requires an Educational Assistant for one on one learning, would that be available for him? Would it be available for the entirety of his time in school if he needs it?

I will probably post more after (kids need a bath) but if someone who has gone through all of this could share their experiences and knowledge of the systems with me, it'd be incredibly appreciated!

I'm looking for recommendations on a good , fast, dependable ISP in the Lower Mainland (Maple Ridge/Tricities). I'd prefer a small independent ISP that doesn't throttle you if you download or stream a lot. I'd even be willing to pay a little more. Recommendations for big Telcom ISP's OK too.

2. I keep seeing these beautiful, cheap cabins and cottages that I guess are being rented out over the winter. What's the catch with these? Moving out in the summer is fine, being totally secluded is not-again, no car.

3. How does the cost of living compare to the lower mainland? I can see rents are much cheaper, but what about food and utilities? I'm primarily concerned with the cost of produce and dry goods.

4. I'd be interested in finding work trimming certain trees, any particularly good towns for that?

Anyways, my question is what Canadian telephone companies do you suggest I should choose? I decided to lean away from an international plan on my current provider(AT&amp;T) as it would be too expensive.

I'm planning on road tripping it up there in a couple weeks. My boyfriend and I are planning on driving from Vancouver to Salmo, B.C. for one leg of the trip (for Shambhala Festival :D ) So my question is, would it be feasible to make this drive in one day? According to googlemaps its a nearly 9 hour drive - but I think that's a doable distance for two people taking turns. It just looks like there aren't a whole lot of towns for long stretches on that route, and I'm concerned about running out of gas. What do ya'll think?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. What we're hoping for;

- Affordability. We're no rock stars, so average prices, or less than, would be great (Going to be less than 50 people there)

- Scenic. We're hoping for the Rocky Mountains (even AB), or the Kootenays, or the Thomp-OK regions. If it's awesome enough, we will consider the island or somewhere in the South West (populated) end of BC.

- Ideally outside. While inside a small town would be fine, ideally not in a city. Straight up in nature would be pretty awesome. 

- No church required, but we are looking for a place that can maybe do the ceremony and reception in one area/package.

EDIT: **This is on Highway Five in Little Fort, BC.** We haven't had time to change the signs and everything, so it is currently labeled Bree's Inn/Cafe. The actual name is **High Five Diner** and will reflect that name soon once everything is setup!

Since people are asking, we'll toss you up a free piece of pie (or cheesecake!) at the end of your meal if you mention Reddit or that Tyler recommended you. If you happen to be a trucker and know how to contact them, let them know this too! The pie is to die for, I promise.

If we get some people coming in, perhaps we can do some more deals =)",,False,self,t5_2qnc6,True,,,True,t3_r2eeh,http://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/r2eeh/how_do_i_contact_large_amounts_of_truckers/,

I've lived out here just over a year and a half now, and I fall more and more in love with the beauty of British Columbia every single day. I've been a lot of places in this world, and barring maybe the Arctic in the summer, I've not seen anywhere as spectacular as here.

Since real estate in the Lower Mainland is completely fucked (I can think of no better description for it, to be honest), I've decided that I want to take my cash and buy some land somewhere away from the GVRD and build a small cabin in the mountains somewhere.

Requirements:
1. Just be within a 4-6 hour drive of the Lower Mainland.
2. Power is not necessary, but a nice bonus.
3. Must have relatively decent road access (can be unpaved).
4. Must be in the wilderness.

That's it.

Where should I be looking? Ideally, I'm only looking for an acre or few. I don't need a lot of land. Price is most important. The island is not out of the question, either.

If your too shy to post please pm me, I will not share your information. 

edit: clarifcation

(1)Thank you VERY much for all your comments. I really appreciate them as picking an MBA program is important to me. Recent trinity western MBAers input is extremely appreciated. I am looking at their non profit mba because it would allow me to juggle work and give me a work related employment edge (or at least i have an in on how to leverage it). I ask questions related to religious influence because I don't want to be involved in business theorycrafting that discriminates because they are founded on religious principles. I want to know i can get an objective learning experience of a non profit nature with different inputs and not have my progress be hindered by policy control of information or censorship. 

(2) pre-emptive: i realise i could probably get that specific specilization in other business mbas but i just like to do research on this sort of matter. Obviously if Trinity's Mo conflicts with mine at an extremely fundemntal level (as in my personal principles and code of ethics) i'll move on. This isn't the only channel i'm seeking inputs from, but they are extremely appreciated!

I'll be on my way though to Englishmans Creek park on Lake Koocanusa from Edmonton in a week or so, and would rather not bring 700lbs of water along for the ride if I don't have to.

Does anyone know of any places where I can fill up the fresh water tank along the Crowsness Pass?  I'll be coming in through Sparwood to Fernie to Elko.

I gather the provincial park has a sanidump for $5, but not clear if I can fill up on water there.

About location, I am not sure where to go. I am aware that Whistler is quite a hot place to go, but also expensive. I have also looked at Revelstoke and Banff. I am quite psyched about Revelstoke, but I am afraid if it's big enough to keep me entertained for a whole season?

So how can you help me?
I know its much to ask, but if any of you knew any who; might were going to rent out a room, needed a roommate for an apartment, needed a seasonal employee or literally anything else. I would greatly appreciate it.

Either way, I would really love to meet up with any of you redditors when time comes. :)",,False,self,t5_2qnc6,False,,,True,t3_d3ihj,http://www.reddit.com/r/britishcolumbia/comments/d3ihj/traveling_to_bc_from_denmark_this_winter_to/,

My name is Patrick, and I'm a bit of a Twilight character. When I saw the Kelowna brony group meeting up in a... less than desirable manner, I set out to organise, plan and make lists. The previous admins have done a fine job making BUCK (Bronies Under the Care of Kelowna) into what it is, but have made some choices I found a bit frustrating; lack of publicity, awkward dates/times for meetups, and a focus on just Kelowna. I offer to you, a bit of a rebirth;

On August the Twelfth, a Sunday following this weekend, we will be holding a meetup for both Kelowna and all surrounding areas. It starts at 1:00 PM, at Parkinson Recreation Centre, and goes until people feel it's done. This is just the first meetup, focusing on the people aspect of the community; we won't be up to anything more exciting than meeting fellow fans and bronies. I'm pretty excited all the same.

Please bring a blanket or a lawn chair, if you plan to attend. We're meeting outside, and I have found no way of providing proper seating for everyone. Hopefully, enough people will be able to bring *some* kind of surface, that we can have everyone sitting on something that isn't grass. Blankets would be best, seeing as they're small and can seat 2-4 people, but lawn chairs are more than welcome.

I have the highest hopes for this meetup, and the ones to follow.

Hello again- here's another in a continuing (2 so far) series of requests for input to help us settle in BC. We're moving up from California at the end of August, and will be in the Lower Mainland at the end of July looking for housing. Since we don't currently have jobs in BC, we're concentrating our housing search to Maple Ridge/Pitt Meadows, and the Tricities of Coquitlam/Port Coquitlam/Port Moody, and these towns are more affordable than Vancouver (we prefer small communities anyway) and would shorten the commute if we get jobs farther south in the Abbotsford area.
I'd like to hear your recommendations/warnings on neighbourhoods in these areas. We are a professional couple in our mid-50's; don't mind diverse communities, families with kids, etc. Mainly trying to avoid gang/drug/high crime neighbourhoods.
I'm aware that the area south of Haney mall in Maple Ridge has had problems with drugs and crime, and I've noticed some nice looking houses in the Albion area, but that's about the extent of my knowledge.
Thanks in advance for your help!
(I may post on other areas, depending how our search goes- other ""Newbie to BC"" topics sure to come in the future!)

A.) Take advantage of the lowered drinking age

B.) See some beautiful Canadian wilderness.

1.) We'll obviously need passports, any further ID besides drivers' licenses?

2.) I've heard a rumor that some establishments won't sell to American's under 21. Do any of you have recommendations on bars, etc?

3.) First night we'll probably grab a cheap motel and walk around since we plan to consume alcohol. How safe is Vancouver at night?

4.) Is it likely that we'll encounter snow or ice en route to or around Vancouver? Oregon DOT has a trip check website with snow reports. Is there a BC equivalent?

5.) Any obvious things I may not be considering? Currency exchange? Etc?

She had never rented a room in her house before and I had never rented a room before, nor did we know each other prior to moving in. We never signed anything and basically took care of everything verbally and through trust.  I paid her a damage deposit when I moved in, but not a pet deposit as she said she didn't think we needed one since I only had a cat and she had several cats and dogs. I've been here for just over 3 years and things have been fine, but now that I am moving out we have some things we don't see eye to eye on. So my cat has scratched a small area of carpet, it's basically the strip of carpet under my bedroom door that he can fit his paw underneath. The carpet is a bit frayed and worn now in that spot, but it isn't worn right down or anything. Aside from this my cat sits on this one very large window sill that is white, I've cleaned it but it would need a coat of paint to make it look like it did when I moved in and finally my cat has scratched the front door so there are some very shallow marks on the lower part of the painted door. She thinks the damage deposit should cover the sill and door to be repainted and to replace the strip of carpet. I think some of this might be considered regular wear and tear rather than neglect, but I don't want to screw her over in any way so I would like some opinions from people who have rented or been landlords.

The plan is now to go back as soon as the snow is gone and enjoy it before it will get crowded with other day trippers.

&gt;The Liberals took the last election by neutralizing the NDP; in implementing a carbon tax, they earned the support even of Greens like David Suzuki. This time around, the NDP, which is already putting out slick, direct mailers pairing images of rusty, hulking tankers with pristine coastline, is making sure the Green vote remains with New Democrats.

If so, can you please provide proof of such an assertion, and to be fair, can you please open the books for all Liberal donations so we can be sure the Liberal Party of B.C. is not taking from ""foreign groups that are meddling in our politics"" as well.

I realize there's **a ton** of other issues associated with BC separatism, such as revenue considerations for example. I also realize that Quebec has a *federal* separatist party, but I've always felt as MP's vote on issues within the House of Commons an effective separatist party would have to be provincial, and gaining the majority of the province's vote.
