Hi AskCulinary. I've been lurking this subreddit for a few weeks now, and I've seen some people talk about olive oil. A search showed that there is the occasional substantial question about olive oil, and I have found the answers to be only half-correct at best.

As it so happens, my primary role in the food industry is olive oil. I run a small organic olive orchard with my mother in law, and we produce some of the finest oil available in America. We also retail olive oil and balsamic from around the world. I know a lot about the flavor profiles, regional variaties, desirable/undesirable attributes of olive oil. Not to mention the chemistry and process behind making it. I'd love to answer any questions people have, so let me know if there is any interest.

I hope this is the right way/place to offer this. ",,False,,t5_2t82m,1348000807.0,,,True,t3_10240k,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/10240k/would_anyone_be_interested_in_a_miniama_from_an/,

Hello r/askculinary! Firstly, we would like to thank everyone here for making r/askculinary what we feel is the best cooking related sub reddit. With your help, we were able to grow considerably and share our knowledge with now over 23k people in 10 short months. And there is no sign of us slowing down. In due time, our community here will hopefully not only be one of the best culinary forums on Reddit, but on the entire internet as well. Very few website have a community as knowledgeable as our community here.

However, with our increase in subscribers, we are in need of your help!

In the past few months, we have seen heavy increases in what we feel are “low quality” comments and posts.  I am sure most of you (especially our frequent and longtime contributors) have realized this. Many of us describe this common “problem” as the so called “gradual degradation” of sub reddits. Basically, the more popular a sub reddit gets (or any website for that matter), the more the quality diminishes. For most websites, this is not really a “problem” as this change is just a representation of your audience.

However, r/askculinary has a specific goal. This goal is to put it simply, “To help people of all skill levels become better cooks, to increase your understanding of cooking, and to share valuable culinary knowledge.”

If we are to stay true to our goal, we feel it is necessary to increase and uphold a certain “standard” of quality. Not only is this necessary to keep our community on track towards accomplishing our goal, but to provide reliable and precise information to everyone.
 
**This is where we need your help r/askculinary. In order to uphold our goal here, we need our community to be active in self-moderation.** We need your help in order to keep r/askculinary on track to achieving our constant goal.

We have an outline on what we want to see from the community, but we want to know what your thoughts are as well. **We are open to all suggestions and want to hear from everyone.** This is your chance to make r/askculinary become the community you want, so make sure your voice is heard!

**Posts: We want to see posts that add conversation to our community.**  Remember, this is a community for cooks of all skill levels, from novice to expert. Everyone here is present to converse and share culinary knowledge. We love troubleshooting recipes, food science, technique advice and improving your food in general. Take advantage of this!

* Posts need to be specific, well written and provide adequate detail. The more information you provide the better answer you will receive.  The best questions are those that are focused and direct. Questions that don’t provide enough detail or are vague in general are not possible for us to answer correctly.

* We are not here to provide recipes. Any post asking for generic recipes will be removed without hesitation.  We are here to troubleshoot the recipes, not flat out give you one, because that doesn’t solve the problem or make you a better cook. Obscure or extremely specialized recipe based questions may be exempt from this rule. We are here to dissect, troubleshoot and critique the recipes, not to provide them.

* Posts that mainly have to do with kitchen professionals or that are directly related to a professional environment are not suitable here. r/kitchenconfidential is your home for strictly professional responses to strictly professional questions. These include posts for war stories, work clothing recommendations, problems with your kitchen job, or industry advice. r/kitchenconfidential is filled with a much higher proportion of industry professionals than we are.

* Use the search function. Many questions you have are very common and have been answered thoroughly in the past. Don’t waste our time by posting something that was just posted a month ago.

* If you have any question on the validity of a post, message the mods and ask.

* If you see any post that you feel is inappropriate, report and downvote it. We need you to be active in your community moderation (ie: up/downvoting and reporting). When in doubt, don’t hesitate. Report it!

**Comments: We want to see comments that are precise and either answer the question fully or add to the conversation in a positive way.** The more detail you provide, the better this serves everyone. Having intelligent, respectful gastronomic conversation is a true joy for many of us here.

* Comments must be accurate and well informed. You do NOT need to be a chef or work in the industry to comment. You do however have to be informed in your response. We realize cooking is very subjective and in a lot of cases there is no “right” way to cook something. With this being said, your comment must have substance and validity.

* Your comments must be precise and well written. Short one or two word responses are not appropriate. Elaborate as much as possible while keeping true to the question. If you don’t have anything that adds to the conversation and are just posting some personal anecdote, don’t bother. These comments do nothing but crowd and diminish the quality of the thread.

* Keep your comments on topic. This is not a place to joke, make puns or meme references. If you don’t have anything constructive to say, do not comment. People come here to have intelligent conversation about cooking, not to get a chuckle in.

* If you see anything that violates these rules, be sure to report and downvote the material. Do not hesitate. If you’re not sure, report it. This is absolutely crucial to our future success.


**Remember, it is crucial that you do your part in terms of self-moderation. If you see anything you think is out of line, report it.** We mods can’t do this by ourselves and we are putting our trust in the community to help us out.

Speaking of mods, with our increase in moderation, we are looking for a couple more. If you feel like you would be able to help out, let us know. It is a thankless job that can take a good portion of time, so be warned. Send us a message if you are interested and we can provide an outline of what the duties specifically are.

Lastly, we are in the works of working on an r/askculinary wiki. The amount of information that has already been shared here is incredible, and to be able to organize this information we need more than a short FAQ. In addition, we have a major sidebar renovation in the works as well. This will be implemented in the near future and we will follow up with a mod post when this occurs. This new sidebar will hopefully outline our goals and intentions better and be easier and more understandable to read.

Thank you r/askculinary and cheers to the future!

This mostly applies to new folks, but it’s a useful refresher for everyone.

The objective here is simple: there are a goodly number of people with a lot of culinary experience/knowledge who are happy to impart it to anybody who needs help. Don’t know how to do something? Having a problem with a dish? Ask!

In order to keep the community a little more targeted, not /r/cooking-only-better, here are some general guidelines.

1.  Use the FAQ. Questions about knives, pots, steaks, books? It may very well be in there.

2.  Read the sidebar.

3.  Best questions are questions with a little bit of specificity to them: “how do I [ ]?” or “I’m having trouble with [ ]”

4.  Less-best questions are those like “I have a piece of salmon, what should I do with it?” That’s not something really calling on expertise. But “how can I poach salmon so it doesn’t dry out” is much better.  If it's the sort of question that calls for a lot of different answers from enthusiastic amateurs, you'll probably be better-served elsewhere.  

5.  We will not answer health/food safety questions. No two ways about it. “How do I store food” questions are OK, but “is it safe” questions will be deleted when seen.

6.  If somebody asks how to do something a specific way, a useful response addresses that. If the poster wants to make roux in the oven, don’t tell him or her how to make it on the stove. However, if the question inspires a related question from you, please go ahead and submit it.

7.  Rudeness will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

8.  Please report any posts you think are problematic. If you have a post deleted and you think the deletion was in error, let somebody know.

A few other odds and ends:

If you want flair, apply for it. Message the moderators and tell us what your culinary background/expertise is.  You don't have to have professional experience.  Just because a poster has flair doesn't mean his or her word is gospel.  

Most importantly, the purpose of this whole thing is to carry out our goals. Is there anything we could do differently? Anything we aren’t doing but should, or are but shouldn’t? This is the thread to let us know. We're trying to be a helpful, inviting, and knowledgeable group.

I receive no karma, so please up vote to the top so everyone can see.**

Hello /r/askculinary! First of all, from all of us moderators, we would like to thank you lovely community members. We have seen some absolutely amazing gastronomic discussions here, and hope you continue to provide the community with such helpful and thoughtful conversations.

With the rate of growth we have had the past few months, we feel it is necessary to make a few changes, reiterate some points and get the communities feedback on a few issues. The goal of these potential changes is to provide everyone with a better experience in our community. **We want to hear all of your feedback on these issues.**

Our main concern is about some of the questions that are being submitted.

* **Recipe based question**s - If you refer to our current rule #5 located in our sidebar, you can see that not every recipe based question is encouraged here. **We are not Google.** If you simply need ideas for a piece of meat, or want to know a great pie recipe, you will most likely get many great answers through google, or even other sub reddits. /r/cooking, /r/food or /r/recipes are all options. However, we understand there are some recipe based questions that are more uncommon, and harder to find legit answers, and in that case, you may post here. Think of /r/askculinary as the last resort. Questions like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/u1cbr/accidentally_bought_5_pounds_of_chicken_thighs/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/uulzx/whats_your_favorite_goto_burger_recipe/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/vcrfg/i_love_soup_but_hate_hot_summers_cold_soup/) are not desirable here. Questions like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/vesqp/how_could_i_modify_this_recipe_for_nutella/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/pvesc/my_red_enchilada_sauce_always_seems_to_be_missing/) are fine however. Notice the difference in the quality of the question. The OP provides much more background and information in the posts that are well written. The more specific you can make a recipe/ingredient based question, the better.

* **Discussion based questions** - This sub reddit and community was created to help people become a better cook, and to increase your culinary knowledge. If a post has little to do with cooking, and would not help others with the answers, we feel this is not accomplishing our original goal. Questions like these three([#1](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/twp9r/line_cooks_and_chefs_what_was_your_worst_kitchen/), [#2](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/tmk7o/everyone_has_been_experimental_in_the_kitchen_so/), [#3](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/urebw/chefs_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_fatal_mistake/)) are not very appropriate here. Perhaps /r/KitchenConfidential is better. That being said, posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ty7uh/raskculinary_what_are_some_of_your_little_magic/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/vcqn6/i_liked_the_culinary_vice_responses_so_much_what/), are completely fine. Basically, if the answers to the question being asked would help the community in their culinary adventures, it is fine. **If it is just to share war stories and what not, we feel these do not fit in here.**

* **Question and comment formatting** - **With every question you ask, please be sure to give as much detail as possible.** The more detail you can give us, the better we can help you. Conversely, the more through you can be in your responses and comments, the better. Try to avoid those one or two word comments, make it as thorough as you can. We are aware that this is not always possible or necessary, but try and make your posts as thoughtful as possible. [Good post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/rfevk/looking_to_replace_a_damaged_nonstick_skillet/), [not so good post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ulrjg/cookin_rice/) [Great post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/vjj4f/perfect_authentic_pho_what_are_the_restaurant/c558e0j), [not so great post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/vjj4f/perfect_authentic_pho_what_are_the_restaurant/c552rku).

* **Reposting, search function and FAQ** - **Please utilize the search function, and our FAQ before posting.** There are quite a bit of posts made that are extremely similar to each other that could be easily answered without reposting. We are in the works of possibly updating our FAQ, as well as updating some CSS coding. This will be done to remind the community of what is appropriate and give them some helpful resources.

This about sums up all of our ideas and issues that have been expressed by ourselves, and the community. **So I ask you r/askculinary, what are your thoughts on these issues? How do you feel about these potential changes?** We would love to heat all of our feedback regarding the future of this community.

I hated cooked veggies until I learned to cook them with a bit of crunch still. The thing that I think made me such a better cook was simple too - a meat thermometer.

AMA,Pandanleaves,280,58,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/138tpd/i_became_a_millionaire_by_selling_fried_chicken/,"Hello everyone. A while back, someone requested an AMA for this subreddit. I asked my grandmother and she is willing to do an AMA. However, she is sick at the moment, so I'll collect questions for now and follow up with the responses next week when she gets better. I will answer some questions immediately if I know the answer (the general stuff).

My grandmother first opened her business in 1983 in Indonesia. She started selling fried chicken in front of her house and it became widely popular. She expanded by moving to another building on the same street and turned it into an open-air restaurant: a huge open space under a shade. Even though the place easily seated 200, there were lines during mealtimes.

My grandmother's fried chicken is nothing like KFC's. It's traditional Indonesian fried chicken. The chicken is seasoned with spices until yellow, then deep fried without any flour. If you were lucky enough to visit Bali, then it is very similar to the famous Balinese crispy duck. She only uses a specific breed of chicken known for its richer flavor (although the meat yield is low); a parallel would be Amish chicken. The pre-seasoned chicken was put on display and the customers could pick whichever piece they wanted. This means they can pick whichever piece they feel is the largest, so they never feel gimped.

A few years later, the noodle shop across the street closed down. My grandmother saw this as an opportunity to take their old customers and started selling chicken noodles, which was a huge hit even with existing customers.

Sadly, the business is now in decline. The street it was on became one-way, so people had to make a loooong detour to get to the restaurant. Also, the restaurant isn't able to attract new customers; its current customers are the old, loyal customers. Competitors mushroomed and the restaurant feels too old-timey (so the younger generation isn't so keen on it). However, my grandmother already made her fortune from the 10-20 years of glory, starting from a humble business in front of her home.

That's enough background. Ask away.

P.S. Mods, how do I verify this?

P.P.S. If this becomes popular, I'll try asking my uncle to do an AMA. He has a PhD in food science and owns his own lab.

To the *meat* of the matter, though. I'm an absolute novice at cooking, and one of the few things I can do really well is toast and eggs and variations thereupon. Any time I try and branch out I've either a) failed miserably or b) succeeded at lighting my blender on fire. But that's another story for another time...

Today, though, I SUCCESSFULLY MADE MY FIRST DISH. A chicken stir fry, à la [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-stir-fry-3/). I did have to make a couple substitutions, however.

* Used ground red pepper instead of flaked red pepper.
* Used garlic powder instead of minced cloves.
* Used all-purpose flower instead of cornstarch.
* Used Lo Mein noodles instead of rice, although this probably doesn't make much difference seeing as how it's basically a side.

Those ingredients scaled to whatever exchange system I could find online (and a bit of help from my mother, who yelled at me from the living room some tips - Yes, I'm 16). Anywho, everything else proceeded as the recipe stated, although after stirring the vegetable/chicken mixture in step four, I covered the skillet and let sit, stirring once about every two minutes - to ensure that the chicken was cooked all the way through. Again, another precaution by my mom.

So! I got done, cleaned up, and tasted my dish. *Not bad*. *Not bad at all, young grasshopper*. However, it was a bit dry. So, my question to you, O Sages of /r/askculinary, is two fold.

1. What makes various meats cooked various ways become dry (e.g lamb, beef, chicken cooked via broiling/roasting/frying)? and...
2. What can I do to fix my dryness, besides adding some Replens into the mix?

There is no index of any kind, and searching for the name of an ingredient brings up every single reference to that ingredient throughout the entire book.

The process was then, ""Hmm...lamb starts with L...there are 300+ pages, so maybe it'll be one of the pages towards the middle of the book?""

I've looked everywhere for advice on this but since home sausage making isn't exactly common, it's hard to come by tips on the issue. 

Here's my situation/problem:

I have a kitchenaid mixer w/ food grinder attachment. I also have a stuffer. The grinder works great - I take the time to cut my meat into chunks and toss it in the freezer for a bit so it passes through the grate without getting all stringy (I know there's a technical term for this, but don't know what it is). My sausage recipes are decent - I'm not lighting the world on fire, but they are tasty. My problem comes in the stuffing.

The only casings I have access to locally are natural casings packed in salt. They tend to be decent quality - no holes or tears. From what I read, the naturals tend to be harder to work with. They are relatively cheap (compared to the fake ones I could get online), and I really do prefer a nice crisp skin from a natural casing. 

At first I tried loosening the casings in water, tying one end, setting them up on the stuffer nozzle, and stuffing them. I had problems. After reading some more, I decided that I should let the casings sit in water overnight before using them. This didn't help much.

**Problem #1**: The sausage, when twisted into links, doesn't STAY in links.

**Related Problem #1-a**: When they cook, the casing shrinks but the meat expands, and with no seal on the end, they just bust right out into a mess.

**Related Problem #1-b**: How ""filled"" should the sausages be before they are twisted into links? Should I press as much in there as I can, or leave it a little loose?

**Problem #2**: How important is the ""drying"" process? What is a good method? Is there a way to accomplish this in a standard home kitchen? (I also tried to do this myself, but to no avail)

**Problem #2-a**: Some things I read suggested poking small holes in the casings for the drying process. Necessary, or terrible advice?

**Problem #3**: I've often heard of chefs using ice as a ""binder"" for sausage, particularly pork sausage, but I have no idea how this is accomplished or what purpose it serves. Is this causing my problems? Should I be doing it anyway? Should it be done for non-pork sausages?

I did it based off of a recipe I found on the internet a couple of years ago, and it was an absolutely badass dish.  
One wrinkle, however.
I can't find the recipe.  I remember the general steps, and I have photos, but the specifics are hazy.  
I've agreed to make this dish again for a vacation coming up in a couple of weeks, but I'm afraid of screwing it up.
SO, I come to thee, asking the great minds of Reddit to help me fill in the blanks.

As a bonus, I've recovered some photos from doing the process last time, so I'll post those, too.  Unfortunately, they haven't given me many clues as to what the hell I was doing at the time.
[A little Foodporn](http://imgur.com/a/iAMN4)

First things first, the dry rub.  I know that I used brown sugar, cayenne, black pepper, and salt.  I also know there was more to it than that, based solely off of the innumerable amount of dry rub recipes out there.  If someone has personal experience with a particular one, I'd love to try it out.

Next step was brining the shoulder.  I used the dry-rub as a brine, but I'm not positive as to how much, or if I also added extra salt, or what.  I also seem to remember it was an 18 hour process.

After the brine, I applied the dry rub pretty generously.  Once seasoned, I cut the thing in half (long-ways) and stuffed it with red and green bell peppers and folded it back over.  As I say in the gallery, I'm thinking of adding some garlic and onion this time.  Maybe even a tiny habanero.  Again, the only step missing here is what did I put in the dry-rub.

The next part is the oven.  I'm pretty sure I did it overnight, but I can't remember what the temperature was, or if there was some formula I followed based off of the weight of the roast.  Also, the blackness at the bottom of the pan scared me at first, but it turns out that it was pretty delicious.  The gooey blackness ultimately ended up in the crock-pot with the rest of the shredded pork goodness.

The next part is the fun part.   The sauce.  I have no clue what I used to sauce the shredded pork.  What I do know is that I wasn't going to waste this time and effort just to pour KC Masterpiece on it.  I remember making a concoction of tomato paste, maybe a little ketchup, Sriracha, brown sugar, and a few other things.  This is another point where you guys come in.  I need a sauce that's going to give this animal that BBQ identity.  Something sweet/spicy/savory, but doesn't overpower the meat.  I'm very open to suggestions on this one, so if you've got something and don't mind sharing it, I'm all ears.

So that sums it up.  I appreciate any suggestions that y'all are willing to send my way, and I look forward to giving you guys feedback on how it works out.  I'm photo-happy when cooking, so expect a thorough foodporn thread to come out of this.

I did about 40/60 cold-brewed coffee to water.  A hefty splash of bourbon (and some for the cook), some black peppercorns, a hefty pinch of salt, a good chunk of brown sugar, and one each dried chipotle and cayenne peppers.  I let the peppers &amp; peppercorns simmer in just the water for a good while before adding the other materials.  

I brought the whole mix to just around steaming with no simmer.  Turned the heat off and slipped the room temperature fish in.  I gave it a good 10 minutes since the temperature was lower than I'd poached with before -- that timing turned out to be perfect.

The results: the salmon was tender, of course.  It had very delicate smoky flavors reminiscent of (guess where this is going) hot-smoked salmon fillets.  There was also just enough bitterness and spice to make you think of the smell of grilled salmon -- as if you pressed your nose right up next to a light char mark on a fillet that had just come off the grill.

I've also cooked many salsas, even for competitions.  However, never, ever, have I produced a result that is anything like what I taste in even the most basic Tex-Mex restaurant.

Searching the internet brings me the following:  lies (tastes nothing like restaurant, maybe even sucks), legit Mexican-style salsa (but this is not the same thing at Tex-Mex), or something very fresh (pico or salsa-fresca style) which I can already make.

When I cook myself, I always use fresh ingredients (is this a mistake?) and the results are usually quite watery (which I drain).  It tastes great, but I want to make something like what I enjoy in my favorite restaurants. Usually what I cook has a consistency similar to fresh or roasted Italian tomato sauce.

Any tips or recipes?  What are the restaurants doing that I'm not?  How do I get that consistency that is thick and smooth, but still spicy and full-flavored?

I was going to link to a few of the offending posts, but I have changed my mind and I am not going to single out a subscriber. This is, absolutely, not a subreddit for sarcasm, derogatory language, or false information. This is a professional subreddit for chefs, inspiring chefs, home cooks, or people who just happen to own an oven. Any question is welcome; keep that in the forefront of your mind before posting a degrading answer to a question. The mods do ask that if you see a post that you believe is unnecessarily rude, please report it. If you get reported enough so that we have to say ""Ugh, again?"" We are going to ban you. We will let you know before we do so, of course, but we are going to start cracking down and more strictly monitoring the posts.  
  
On a lighter note, please do look for similar posts to a question you have. If you have a question about pork chops or something, run a quick search that says ""pork chops"" and limit the search to this subreddit. If you don't find anything or if you don't have your question answered, please, feel free to make a post. This isn't as serious as the point I was making above, by any means. It isn't bannable or anything even close to that. It's more of a convenience thing. If you see a question that is something that's already been asked, don't report it. I'll approve it 100% of the time. This part of the post is merely a suggestion.  
  
Don't take this as thinking this subreddit is a humor free zone or something like that. I just want to ensure that everyone who has a question feels comfortable enough to ask. The last thing I want is for someone to refrain from posting because they don't want to be called an idiot. Hopefully you, as readers and posters, don't want this either. If that happens, it would quickly mean the end of this subreddit.  
  
Lastly (I think, I've probably forgotten something. Check back for an 'edit' just in case. My memory is horrible), if there are too few mods to keep the subreddit as clean as we would like it to be, we may start looking for another mod. If you feel like you are up to the task, keep an eye out for something that indicates that we are looking for one, and message us. Also, in a week or so, if you feel like we aren't doing a good enough job at monitoring posts and we haven't started looking/found a new mod, please message us so we can rethink whether or not to find one.  
  
No tl;dr here. Please read the post and upvote it, I will receive no karma.  
  
EDIT: Well, looking over these posts and suggestions, I've decided to add a rule to the sidebar that tells people to try to ask vague recipe questions in [/r/cooking](/r/cooking). I wasn't going to do this until KDirty mentioned that when the front page is filled with these types of questions, the more specific questions may go unanswered. This does not mean these questions will be removed, but it does mean that they need to be asked elsewhere first, and then asked here if the question goes unanswered.

Since we have had quite the influx of subscribers (at least 5,000) from the AskReddit post, we decided it was in the best interest of the subreddit to remind everyone to read up on the sidebar if you haven't yet done so, and to let everyone know there have been some updates in our FAQ and rules sections. Nothing major in regards to the rules, but we do want everyone to remember that the chefs and cooks here at /r/AskCulinary are not nutritionalists, so please keep that in mind when asking your question.  
  
We also want to specifically remind everyone to please refrain from asking for recipes. We all feel bad every time we have to remove a post due to violation of that first rule, so try not to make us do it. Instead, try looking up and cooking a recipe or two and coming here and presenting that recipe, what didn't work, and what you think went wrong so that the chefs and cooks may better assist you. Please feel free to comment below and/or message the mods if you have any questions. We are definitely willing and happy to help and answer any questions that you may have.  
  
We think the AMA idea is a pretty good one, but if you want to do one, please message the mods first so that we can get it all set up and situated!
  
Lastly, we are also thinking about getting a nighttime mod so that the quality of the subreddit doesn't fall because the mods are asleep. If you are interested in the position, please scroll down to under the rules and click ""message the moderators"" so that we can begin the process. If you message one of us individually, we aren't going to be able to assist you because we all need to be able to read and converse with you.

It got me thinking. 

Traditional recipes are very instructional. Do this to get that.

Like many folks here I look at a recipe and see what the ingredients are and approximately what the ratios are so that I can understand the flavor profile but really pay little attention to the actual amounts and just do what tastes/looks good. In my head I simplify (For example: Shepherds pie, to me, is ground meat in a brown sauce with veggies either in or on the meat and a spread of potatoes on top which are then browned. It may or may not have cheese in the potatoes. It seems the brown sauce is the key and it looks like it’s basically a broth/flour mix rather than broth and corn starch. Got it. I’m good to play.)

I think that anyone who's cooked for a long time does this. (except for bakers...because bakers harness dark magiks)

What I really want to know from a recipe is how much is generally too much of an ingredient, is it absolutely required and if it is required what is the minimum I can put in and still be able to taste it? I also want to know if it has to have something else to play with or if I can change it independently. Maybe there is a list of eight spices from which I should pick three. How about: if you put too much X in you will break the recipe and have to start over. Don’t do that.

If it's a professional chef who's put out a cook book I want to know what they would advise me if I was making that recipe. (Example: It says to use fresh garlic but I use the jarred stuff in my restaurant because I think it works better and and doesn’t alter the dish.) Maybe they’d advise any changes in technique. (It says caramelize but cook it less in the spring and more in the fall to adjust the intensity.)

Are there cookbooks that work like this? (I use Joy of Cooking for example).

2.) I like to keep my pans on the edge of the flat top with a little oil in them so they will be hot and ready whenever I get orders.(don't let them get too hot)

3:) I like to keep a large pot of boiling water on the back burner. Just scoop water out of it with a smaller pot as needed.

Anyway, we bought a bottle of sauce and brought it back with us, but now that it's all gone, we're at a loss as to getting some more.

Trouble is, I don't have the first clue where to start and online recipes I've found are too vague for someone who's never made a sauce like this before.

I'm looking more for tips than I am for recipes. Things I've tried:

* I can only get Nasoya tofu bricks at our local market. Is this a decent brand?
* I've tried various levels of firmness, from extra firm down to silken
* I always press the tofu beforehand with a makeshift heavy-can-on-board-on-tofu stack
* I've tried a few recipes from online, from cooking in a dry empty pan to release moisture, to frying it in a half inch of oil and turning (though I never have fully deep-fried it).
* When frying, I've used generic vegetable oil
* I've tried freezing the tofu first and that seems to get me a little closer to the ideal, but not quite all the way

I just can't get the texture like they do in the restaurants. Their tofu cubes are always perfect: slightly fried, chewy, and porous on the outside; their insides are spongy but not overly moist and they seem to absorb the flavor of whatever dish they happen to be in. They're like little concave sponges. My attempts always turn out as some form of soggy cube which may or may not have a warm layer of grease on the outside.

I think if each of us can cover an hour and a half we can make sure everyone who has a question gets a prompt answer, and we can each make a post stating that a new person is taking over that way you will get the reds knowing you have a message/question.

Edit: Alright everyone I guess some people are into this so I made a quick [spreadsheet schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArKOgoM9CrgfdGRzWDA0eEhtbFlwUXh5Zlc5enAxanc) and who ever would like to sign up can just put their name in an open slot. I have made slots from 11:30-8:30EST and I have taken the first shift. 

I have messaged the mods the idea to put it on the side bar and I would ask that everyone use the same basic title and link to next users slot at the end of your shift. 

Edit2: Added time zone EST

Edit3: We are looking for one more person to fill the 7:00-8:30pm slot. If you would like the time slot please pm me.

How long can I store it before it can no longer be used for sushi? If I can freeze it what's the best method for thawing it?

Stores here often have many brands and price levels of spaghetti and other standard dry pasta shapes. All are 100% durum wheat, but even among the generic store brands, there are price heirarchies. There are brand name pastas for several £'s per 500g, a 'premium' store brand for a bit less, the 'regular' store brand for a bit under £1 per 500g, and then on the bottom shelf, the 'budget' store brand in a drab package which is often something like 35p for 1kg. In other words, a *huge* price difference per gram.

I've entered three times. I took home first once and didn't even place twice. There is no time limit, I just need to have 2qts ready to go tomorrow at noon. 

In year's past I've gone with my standard recipe which is a beef/pork/lamb mix, AB's chili powder, roasted red pepper, coffee, chocolate (more or less). The key was always to heat it up and allow it to cool three times (lid sealed whenever in danger zone, refrigerated as soon as low enough temp, and reheated for a substantial time before the final serving). 

This year I want to try something different. I'm looking for some advice on plan of attack, and have a few solid questions. Let me start with the questions, my hypothesis, and then get to the recipe which will reflect how I plan on trying to address these questions. 

I like making the powder, and I will toast up a batch in case it is needed for late-stage seasoning, but I'm going with Kenji's method here: http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/01/the-best-chili-recipe.html  

Do the fruitier chiles lose there bouquet over prolonged heating? In beer brewing, you have an early addition hops and a late addition hops, this is because during the course of your boil the aromatics of the hops are destroyed leaving only the bitterness, and late additions, or even dry hopping allow for the citrusy and floral aspects to come through. I'm going to go with a late addition of roasted red pepper, and fresh poblano to hopefully carry more of the fresh, fruity pepper through to the final product. 

Do all the meats flavor carry through? In the past I've used ground meats of lamb/pork/beef. I think this year I want to use cubed tri-tip and ground pork, and leave it at that. I can't say I've ever really *tasted* the lamb in it, but I always did get a hearty *meat* flavor. How much of that do you think was attributable to the lamb? 

Is masa worth it? I've always thickened with masa, and like the body it gives chili, but it's not really a great thickener. It sort of just rehydrates to thicken, there is no starchy-action going on there. I think I'm just going to reduce this batch to desired consistency and then a masa to taste. 

How important is umami with the flavor of the meat? I'm thinking of going with some pureed anchovies with this. However, I've never quite isolated in my palate what umami *is*. That said, I love chili with mushrooms, and I think that may have been why. Advice here is much needed. 

Ok - the plan: 

Prepare the chile pastes - Seed and toast the flesh of 1/3 ancho, 1/3 gaujillo, 1/3 arbol chiles (ratio by weight, I think this will be about 3/4oz each, but will update when I see it on the scale) in a dry cast iron skillet. Transfer to pot, cover with chicken stock and a shot of vodka, simmer until rehydrated. Transfer all liquid and chiles to blender or food processor and puree with 3-4 anchovies, 4oz chopped carrot, 4 oz chopped celery, 4 oz chopped onion (mire poix).

Prepare the powder - Same combination, toasted, and ground in a coffee grinder. No cumin, garlic, oregano, or salt here, those can all be added independently, this is *just* chile powder. 

Cube the tri-tip in 1/2-3/4"" chunks and brown in pork or beef fat on very high heat. Each side needs to get a really good sear, without drying out the meat. Salt as desired. Set aside. 

Brown the pork in small batches reserving fat. I'm using ground pork here to vary the texture of the end product. I'm contemplating just getting pork shoulder and cubing it in 1/4 chunks? Thoughts? 

1 c. finely diced onion gets carmelized in the same pan and transferred to the stock pot. 

4 cloves finely crushed garlic added to the stock pot with some fat and sweat. Shortly after garlic becomes aromatic, add 6oz tomato paste, 1 beer (stout - non guiness), the meat, 1 cup strongly brewed coffee, 3-4 TB better than bullion beef, 2-3 oz dark chocolate bar, and your chile puree. Simmer for 3-4 hours with lid cracked open, stirring regularly. *edit: I usually add 3oz cider vinegar here too*

Cool, refrigerate overnight. The next morning: 

Roast one red pepper and one poblano and peel,  finely chop or puree it. While bringing  chili up to temperature. Add this 10 minutes before removing from heat and packaging to go to contest. Add chili powder and ground black pepper to taste, salt if necessary (I salt at every stage so rarely need it at the end). 

That's it. Thoughts or advice? Also, before we get into a link fest, I've already read:

edit: Also, should I consider a shallot addition with the Red &amp; poblano peppers

update #1: Chile's toasting. Ended up being 1oz / 1oz/ .25oz (arbol). The arbols are just too thin walled to get a full 1oz out of without having so much to burn your face off. 

update #2: It's all in the pot. I used red wine instead of vodka, and am brewing the coffee addition currently. I also added 1/2 can of chipotle in adobo to the pepper paste. I love that stuff. Initial reaction is that the color is much darker brown than I'm used too, however, I also all but eliminated tomatoes from this recipe, so that accounts for that. And the beer I used is an irish stout I brewed last year, which is near-black, so that attributes to that. 

update #3: Just dropped it off, am now camping out at the bar until judging commences and then some. Hopefully, I'm not too schnockered before they announce the winner. In the meantime, [an album!](http://imgur.com/a/bwJWr#0)

update #4: There were 9 contestants total, I ended up winning 1st. Part of winning is the bar sponsors you to make a large batch for the superbowl, so that will be my next challenge.

[This recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1jsabs/what_it_means_to_post_a_good_answer_in/) in /r/askhistorians illustrates that.

There has been a fair amount of discussion about what makes a good question or a bad one. There has been a lot less about what makes a good answer. Following the example of /r/AskHistorians, we would like to set out some guidelines.

Cooking, by its nature, is more subjective than history or science, because cooking usually comes down to taste, and taste is subjective. Therefore we will never, and could never, be too stringent. However, there are still some guidelines everyone should consider when choosing how to respond to inquiries.

**Do I, the answerer, know what I'm talking about? Do I have a solid basis for my answer in my own study and/or experience?**

If the answer to those questions isn't absolutely ""yes,"" you're better-off not answering. People have problems with, or questions about, food and cooking. We want to be a repository of expertise, both professional and non-, to address those questions. **Answers that don't further the conversation in a meaningful way are worse than no answers at all.**

It goes without saying that moderators can't police every comment always. The upvote/downvote process is the best way to sort good answers from bad ones.

ALONG THOSE LINES, we're going to implement **new standards for flair**. Rather than giving flair to all applicants, we're requesting that anyone applying for flair show a history of prior quality posts and comments meeting the above criteria. Just because someone has flair doesn't mean s/he is right, but we want flair to be a representation of proven expertise and excellence in question answering.

It's worth unpacking that last bit a little.

Expertise is simple: you know what you're talking about. This doesn't mean you're a professional. Some of the best commenters don't have professional experience, but they give correct and detailed advice.

Excellence in question-answering is related, but not the same. Not just knowing the answer, but **explaining it in a clear, easy-to-understand fashion that anticipates follow-ups and answers them too**. The best answer is contextualized to the question; If the person asking is a novice, a brief answer is less helpful than one that gives context and explains, for instance, why a dish is best prepared in a certain way.

It is also important to **consider if the answer you are giving is answering the question asked**. Questioners are usually attempting solve a specific problem and general ruminations on the topic will not be of any particular use to them.

Finally, **be respectful**. It is fine to disagree with other commenters, but you should express that disagreement by presenting evidence to the contrary, not with abuse. If you find someone has been rude to you, please report it to the mods instead of engaging. Arguing on the internet is not a good use of anyone's time.

*Edit: Surprised with the turn out of burger lovers! I tried the no molding quick cooking method tonight and I was very pleased with how they turned out. Very juicy and tasty. I'll have to fine tune now that I'm starting to understand the process a little more. I'd like to try using different cuts of ground meat in the future. Thanks again for all the personal recipes and keep it coming.

I don't know how it happened exactly, but since I started cooking my own food (I was 21 then, now I'm 22), I started to LOVE garlic and I tolerate more olives and mustard too. I can probably start actually liking the last two if I keep giving them a chance. 

But oh boy, onions are something special. I really hate those things, so much that just the smell of it in the food makes me want to throw up (not exaggerating). 

The thing is that a lot of recipes require onions and most of the people I know that eat onions really love them. I'm not giving into the whole ""there's no such thing as food without onions"" thing, but I just want to finally get over my hatred towards onions and start eating them.

The thing is that it will be a nightmare for me. As a matter of fact, I hate them even more when they are cooked. The only way I could eat onions is when they are so finely chopped that I can't taste the pieces of onion in the food.

This seems like a stupid question, but I think that if I don't take it slow I will only reinforce my disgust of onions.

Any tips?

EDIT: thanks for all the replies, didn't expect that much. Here's what I think I'll do: I will not remove onions from recipes. Instead, I will put them in a food processor and maybe reduce the amount. I will also try caramelizing them, since a lot of you think that will help.

I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1hnyvz/cooking_a_duck_in_my_slowcooker_would_love_any/) a couple of days ago, seeking advice on a meal I was planning for some friends. I got some wonderful advice, especially from u/unseenpuppet, and the meal turned out *freaking amazing.* I impressed myself, achieved what I wanted to achieve, and made my guests very happy. 

I wanted to use my slow-cooker, because I had to work for most of the day, and I wanted to do duck. The other goal I wanted to achieve was to bring bright, lively flavors to a roast/slow-cooked meal, because it is summer and heavy braises/flavors are not appealing to me this time of year. 

I broke a ""rule"" I've often heard - never try out recipes and foreign techniques on guests. I'm glad I did! So here's the basic recipe for the duck (and the rest of the meal), for any who are interested:

I bought two ducklings, just under 4 lbs each, and cut them up the night before. I only used the legs and breasts for this recipe. This morning, I put into the slow cooker two oranges, one lemon, and an apple, all cut into 8ths. I also added an onion and one fennel bulb, both thickly sliced, as well as 1/2 a can of OJ concentrate and about 2 cups of chicken stock. I set the legs on top of all that and set it to 8 hours/low. 

When I got home the timer was just going off on the 8 hours. I drained the liquid off and put the legs back into the slow cooker, on top of the spent fruit and vegetables, and just let it hang out on warm till I was done with everything else. I let the liquid simmer and reduce for a bit, then added about a half cup of Verdelho Madeira and let it continue to reduce on med-high heat. 

For sides, I served the most amazingly delicious baby ~~parsnips~~ turnips; I just cleaned them, snipped the stems to leave about an inch, cut them in half and tossed them with salt and pepper and EVOO and roasted them for 20 minutes at 425. One things I have found with roasted potatoes, brussel sprouts, and turnips - don't stir them up halfway through the roast, as some recipes call for. I put them, flat side down, on the pan and just let them stay that way the whole cooking time, then one side of the veggie is golden brown and delicious. I love how simple it is to prepare quality produce when the quality is there to begin with.

I also happened to find white asparagus (wtf? Its not spring!) at Harris Teeter, so, after peeling them, I blanched them in water with salt, lemon, and butter for about 20 minutes. Served with some fresh chopped parsley.

I also served a watercress salad with lemon, EVOO, and pecorino toscana, and it was a perfect bitter counterbalance to everything else on the plate. 

I didn't do a whole lot to the duck breasts. Just scored and seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked them in my cast iron skillet. I don't have a huge amount of experience with duck breast but the technique I found online seemed to work really well - I put the breasts skin side down in a COLD pan, turned the heat to slightly less then medium for almost 20 minutes, and moved them around occasionally for even browning. I flipped them and let the skinless side cook for about 30 seconds, then flipped them back to the skin side and popped them in the 400 degree oven for about 4 or 5 minutes. They were awesome, a really nice med-rare!

The sauce, made from the strained liquids from the slow-cooker, at first tasted a little too bitter, a result of the citrus rinds, I'm sure. I added about 2 teaspoons of sugar to balance that, as well as another splash of Madeira, and it did the trick to balance it out. [EDIT: I forgot to add, I did thicken the sauce with about a tablespoon of cornstarch] Also, that touch of sweetness to the sauce was also a great counterbalance to the watercress and the tiny bit of bitterness in the white asparagus.

Everything on the plate matched so well with everything else. It was such a fantastically unified meal, if that makes sense. I am a strong believer in balance. My biggest gripe in restaurants is that a chef isn't great until they understand that every great dish needs an acid backbone - my career in wine has informed me of that. I am really proud of how well balanced (not to mention delicious!) the meal was.

At one point, one of my guests, who some people refer to simply as ""The Chef,"" leaned over to me and said, ""This is fantastic. And very classically French."" I can't tell you how proud I was.

We served it with a bottle of Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt Josephshofer Riesling Spatlese, which was an impeccable pairing. 

Without r/askculinary's comments and suggestions I surely would have cooked the whole bird in the slow-cooker, and it would not have been half the meal it was, and the breasts would have been demolished, so thank you for that. 

I think it might have been one of the best meals I have ever made. ",,False,,t5_2t82m,1373171483.0,,specialty,True,t3_1hs3nv,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1hs3nv/cooking_duck_in_the_slowcooker_update/,

Which I suppose is exactly what this was!

I am pretty sure I didn't taste caramelisation of the sugars, as predicted by a few in the comments, nor did they ever get anywhere near as deep brown and delicious as they do using the pan method. Probably just too much moisture.

I ended up taking them out the next day and finishing them off in the pan; it definitely reduced the amount of time it took to finish in the pan as they were already broken down and I guess this helps to release the sugar compounds but I'm not convinced that this small time saving was worth the 12 hours in the slow cooker.

I wonder whether it might work better in a low temperature oven in a cooking vessel with a looser fitting lid, where presumably the environment will be a lot drier.

I seared some pork, then deglazed the pan with some wine, reduced a bit, then added some simmering pork broth to it and continued to reduce. It was lovely, dark, and smelled great. Then I saw the bowl of pork juice that had come from the vacuum sealed bag that the pork had come in and thought, hey, what could be wrong with adding more porkiness? This juice was also dark and purplish. I added it straight to what was shaping up to be some great liquid, and it immediately started solidifying and got brighter and cloudier, and then maybe 80% of it had turned into the stuff you see in the images I've linked to.

What happened when I added that pork juice? Was that just coagulating blood or was it some weird ""cold fat added to hot liquid"" thing that I never can understand? Could I have saved it, or was it DOA as soon as I did that?

To be clear, this was a vacuum sealed bag with a raw pork roast inside. I cut open the bag and poured out the small amount of purple liquid that was with the pork. This is the liquid that ruined my sauce.

I'm looking to prepare Maki Sushi on my own in a few days' time. So I thought I might ask you guys a few questions about the preparation and everything.

So:

- What type of fish do you guys recommend? I'm looking for something cheap, as I'm going to prepare big quantities.

- How much fish should I use per roll? Is there a recommended, measurable quantity? 

- I'm going to use a rice cooker. Do I prepare the sushi rice, get it out in a bowl, and then pour some sushi rice oil in it and mix? 

- I heard a lot about keeping my hands wet. Just with water? Or should I use sushi rice oil?

- I'm planning on having some wasabi and soy sauce. Should there be anything else made available? 

That should be it :)

I wound up soaking half of the meat in lime, as you would when preparing ceviche. We decided to put this on a mexican-inspired pizza and bake it, to help mitigate the salmonella risk (big thanks to you guys for pointing that out!)  The acidity of the lime helped break down the otherwise tougher-than-tough meat, and made for a delightful meal.  We breaded and fried the rest of the meat in panko crumbs, too, to enjoy the robust flavor of this robust meat.  That went down well, but boy are our jaws tired.

All in all, a successful night!  We made some extra pizzas, too, just in case the python pies turned out poorly.  Hardly necessary!  You can find an [album of our results here - python ceviche, bbq chicken, and margherita pizzas included](http://imgur.com/a/mMT6h).

I like cooking, but I am not really any good at it. I would love to improve, and I figured some of you might be able to give me some advice. I am sure you all know how to cook a stake better than I do, but for the sake of receiving help, heres what I did.

I swabbed down the steak while warming the pan, rubbed it in olive oil, then applied a generous amount of salt, and some pepper. Once the pan was smoking hot I threw the stake into the dry pan, and flipped it over ever 30 seconds. I did my best not to poke and prod at it too much while cooking. Total cooking time ended up at 5 minutes. Then I let it rest for around two minutes. I was shooting for medium, but it ended up leaning more towards medium-rare. It was served simply, with some rice and pepper sauce, which I'm sad to say came in the form of powder, out of a bag at the shops. I need to learn to make a proper sauce once.

There are some things I know I did wrong. The steak was not room tempered when I began cooking. It had come out of the fridge a couple of minutes prior to cooking. I was too impatient. This made the stake quite a bit more rare then I wanted it to be. I didn't have a proper heavy bottom pan either, which I'm sure also played a role in the stakes ""rare-ness"". I should probably have let it rest of a little while longer, judging by the amount of juice that came out of it when I cut it up, but it was still fairly juicy. Not as juicy as I had hoped, but juicy enough.

Anyway, I know some of the things I did wrong, what other things can I do next time to cook a better steak?

with all the hype going on on Reddit, I decided to give Sriracha sauce a try - it's not really popular where I live. So I found a bottle in a supermarket, bought it - and it simply tastes horrible. I'm not quite sure yet if the sauce is bad or my taste is, so: how does it taste for you?

The one I have kinda tastes like chili as expected, but it has a very strong fishy note and even reminds me of burnt rubber. Not in a ""nice and smoky"" way, but simply... bad. There is something in the taste I like a lot, but it's totally overpowered by that fishy thing. It even strongly smells like that.

There's not much I can compare it to, but I expected it to taste a little like Sambal Oelek, which it doesn't.

Can anyone help?

So we just moved from New York to Oregon. I have two cats. A friend of mine agreed to pick up our cats from the airport and watch the bastards for **three weeks** while we drove across the country. THEN, he let us sleep on his floor for a couple days AND helped us unload a pod of boxes UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. He's a solid friend. He deserves a solid thanks and a solid meal.

I told him I'd cook him a five-course meal for going through all this trouble and occasionally jokingly offer to add an extra course for every great thing he does for us.

Anyway, here's the menu as it now stands, everything will be prepared myself, from scratch.

&gt;First Course: Appetizer

&gt;Oysters on the half shell - sparkling apple mignonette

I've got this great asymmetrical bowl that I'm going to pack with ice and display the oysters on.
I've also got this great five-piece tasting spoon set, wooden platter with four spoons on it. Going to put the mignonette in the spoons.

**Question**: One per person or two per person? I'm not sure if two is too much or if one is not enough?

&gt;Second Course: Soup

&gt;Gazpacho

Plain and simple. Served in a martini glass with a slice of cucumber as garnish (like a lemon wheel).

&gt;Third Course: Salad

&gt;Caprese Salad with avocado and greens. 

One slice each of buratta, tomato and avocado, topped with chiffonaded basil and drizzled with this great balsamic vinegar I've got. I'm going make a little balsamic vin, too and dress a small handful of greens with it. 

&gt;Fourth Course(?) - Intermezzo

&gt;Limoncello Sorbet, served in a shotglass for kicks.

Does the intermezzo count as a course? Never figured that one out. It is just a palette clenser, really. Also, is this the right place to serve the intermezzo? I'm not sure.

**Edit**: So it's been pretty well established that the intermezzo is a little excessive and somewhat unnecessary. At this point I really just want to do it for no reason. Still trying to figure out where to stick it.

&gt;Fifth Course: Entree!

&gt;Scallop Piccata over linguine.

**Question**: How do you typically garnish a pasta dish?

**Question**: How would you present this?

I think I need the most help with this one. I have no idea how I want to present it, and it's the entree. It has to stand up to the other courses. It can't be underwhelming. I'm worried about it being underwhelming. I want to get one U7 scallop per person, sear it off to perfection and serve it over a very small portion of pasta. I have no idea what to serve it in, I have no idea how to present it or garnish it. Any and all suggestions are super appreciated. 

&gt;Sixth Course: Dessert

&gt;Strawberry Poppyseed Ice Cream! 

I'm going to scoop the ice cream in the size and shape of a strawberry and arrange mint leaves on top so they look like strawberry leaves. I'm also going to roll the scoop in loosely scattered poppyseeds on the outside of the ice cream so it looks like seeds.

I think I might also slice fresh strawberries to put around the rim of the bowl.


So that's the menu. I'd love to hear what you guys think of it, what changes you make to the presentation and menu, etc. I appreciate any and all help and suggestions from my AC buddies. :)

Edit: lots of edits made to the menu based off of suggestions made. I can't thank you guys enough. Also, I forgot to ask the following:

Edit 3: It's almost 2 and I'm headed to bed. Thanks all for participating, was fun. Will be back on in the morning to wrap up any final questions.

Edit 4: Some folks have asked for my credentials. The last time I worked in a professional kitchen was back in HS when I did a summer at Pizza Hut. I've never been to any culinary school, anywhere. I've never been to France. Not once. I have 20 years professional experience in corporate IT and I'm ex-Navy. What I _have_ done is literally spent the vast majority of my non-working hours over the past 30 years studying, testing, learning, absorbing and pulling in every bit of knowledge, practice and technique that I possibly could about food and cooking. I've hunted down rare manuscripts in libraries and on the web to study them. I've made more dishes than I care to count where the only purpose was to try out a technique or some such. Can't count the number of times I've fallen asleep reading a cookbook or author's bio.

I like to think of myself as an expert amateur. In other words think of some old guy out on the farm who has been a gun nut/collector all of his life. He owns dozens of collectibles, loads his own shot, mixes his own powder and can take the wings off of a fly from 1,000 yards. He can talk about the history of any gun, any maker, any ammo. How does he compare with the military sniper who has enough decorations on his chest that walking near a pool while wearing them is dangerous? Both do the same thing and it would be dangerous to say which is better, they are just different. For all of my love of food I've NEVER dreamed of owning a restaurant. That's not for me.

For example, I add salt to water when cooking broccoli or greenbeans, with the goal of keeping them a bit greener (does this actually happen or is this an old wives' tale?) - will the same happen if I add MSG instead of salt?  

How about adding it to water - does it affect the boiling point similarly to salt?  

Will it draw liquids out of things similarly to salt?  

Can MSG be used to preserve foods?  

I don't know, these are all quite random, and also all compare it with salt.  Perhaps it has other uses I'm not considering at all - my whole question just arises because I've only heard of MSG being used as a flavoring, and was just curious if it had other useful properties.

I buy a whole side of salmon, cut it into roughly square pieces that I vacuum pack and freeze seperately in plastic bags. Whenever I want to make sushi I get a square piece of salmon out of the freezer, cut it into slices while it's still frozen and start making rice. If you cut the square pieces of salmon in the correct shape and size before you freeze them you will end up with 7-8 slices that can be used for nigiri sushi. When the rice is done the salmon is ready to use (around 5 degrees celsius) The leftovers are used for making a makiroll with the salmon cutoffs, avocado and cucumber or whatever else I have lying around. 

This gives me 5-6 salmon nigiri sushi and a roll of maki, which when cut leaves 7-8 makis. Perfect for dinner for 1 :-)

Now the thing is that that salmon gets quite boring after a while, and I'd like to introduce some variation. Both in the makis and the nigiris. but I don't really  have any good ideas. I've tried with tuna, but it's much more expensive and it doesn't seem to hold up as well in the freezer. It gets dry and boring pretty quickly. I've tried mackerel, and that worked out fairly well. (I can get fresh eel, mackerel, cod, plaice and heering from the local fishermenl). 

Any good ideas as to how to introduce some variation?

I'm having trouble with the caramelizing, though. I can get the onions soft and tasty, but they burn before they get brown. At most they seem to get somewhat translucent.

My current procedure:

Slice into small one inch strips.
Add vegetable oil and a little butter to the pan.
Turn the heat to medium low (3-4 out of 10).
Add onions evenly across the pan.
Cook until they start burning (usually ten or so minutes).

I would like to actually brown them instead of getting soft whitish onion with burns around the edges.

Said recipes generally call for canned tomatoes of some variety. Recently I have been buying fruits and vegetables at farmers market every week and using tomatoes for a variety of sauces. Since using the fresh tomatoes and putting together my own recipe my chili comes out soupy, to the point where I would more call it a chili flavored stew than actual chili, every time. I figure I have one of two problems, either I'm not letting it sit long enough, or I'm just using too much liquid. So here's what I did for my most recent batch, let me know what you think /r/AskCulinary!

1) I started off cutting a large onion, two medium green bell peppers, two sweet peppers and four stalks of celery and cooked them with olive oil in the pot. Medium heat

2) I added about a pound and a half of ground beef into the pot and browned it. Medium heat

3) I threw six roma tomatoes into my food processor and added them in, cooked on a med/low heat for about half an hour.

4) Threw in a can of red beans including the bean sauce within and added about a quarter cup of white wine. Cooked on med for about half an hour.

5) Seasoned to taste (if anyone is curious I personally used white pepper, red pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder and celery salt).

It's delicious, but it's soupy, certainly not chili. Is it just a case of the recipes I used in the past having less liquids than I'm using, do I need to cook it longer to thicken it, am I missing something that should be thickening it (like say tomato sauce). Any help would be much appreciated.

I guess that people think that, because it is ""better"", it is the only one to consider when ""olive oil"" is mentioned. But the very components that give it a good flavor and aroma are the ones that cause it to smoke and become acrid at a relatively low (375ºF) cooking temperature. They also limit the shelf life.

""Extra light"" olive oil has a much higher smoke point, 468ºF, which is entirely adequate for searing a steak. It also has a longer shelf life, and tends to be quite a bit less expensive.

This morning I baked 4 cakes- 1 with applesauce in place of oil, 1 with mayonnaise in place of oil, 1 with mayonnaise in place of eggs and oil and the last one was the standard ingredients. (All were boxed, chocolate cakes by Betty Crocker). 

The applesauce substitute cake was very ""airy"" and the batter was light and tasted ""different"" (couldn't taste the applesauce but it tasted different than the standard directions, maybe my imagination). It baked up in the same amount of time and smelled just like a chocolate cake. After sitting for an hour, I cut into it and served my wife a slice and myself a slice (I did not tell her my experiments). She noticed the cake being moist and fluffy, but did not say anything about flavor. I could not taste the applesauce and it was moister and fluffier. The taste was just like the standard ingredients. 

The mayonnaise substitute for just oil cake batter was lighter than the normal one, less ""airy"" than the applesauce one and the batter tasted a little bit stronger of chocolate, I couldn't taste the mayonnaise in the batter. The cake baked a little quicker than the normal batter (about 2 minutes) and it smelled just like a standard chocolate cake. Again, served a piece to my wife and myself, my wife enjoyed this cake, super moist but held together rather nicely. The chocolate was enhanced and it tasted better than a normal chocolate cake. 

The mayonnaise substitute for oil and eggs batter was thicker, lighter and you could smell the mayonnaise. Tasting it though, you could not taste the mayo. It baked 5 minutes quicker than a normal cake. It was very moist but very light in color. You could not taste the mayo but it did not taste like a chocolate cake, more like a devils food. 

The standard cake batter- well, you know. 

My conclusion: if you're looking for a very moist cake, aren't worried about extra calories or cholesterol and fat, believe it or not, I recommend the mayo substitute for oil only batter.

 If you want a moist and a little healthier cake, I recommend the applesauce substitute for oil cake.

I cook 1-2 full meals a day for myself and my fiance, and I'm noticing that I almost always add salt to the meat, the vegetables, AND the starch. 

I'm comfortable using many other spices to kick up the flavor without salt — but if I cut the sodium entirely from a dish, it usually needs to be added after cooking because it tastes a bit bland. 

I'm interested in what AskCulinary does to reduce (or at least manage) the amount of salt in their *everyday* cooking without sacrificing flavor. This question isn't really motivated by health reasons, but rather the fact that **I feel like salt is a very easy way to add flavor to a dish, and I'd like to challenge myself to create flavor in other ways**.

Thanks in advance!

Is there something obvious that I'm missing? Should I just wash the thing down with some hot soapy water and re-season it?

Only downside is that my family has a really awful knife set here at home, most of which are very, very dull, with some even wobbling loosely in their handles. Everything is difficult to cut, from meat to every kind of vegetable, and honestly requires quite a bit of sawing and hacking.

So the exciting part is that my birthday is coming up, and my parents are looking at getting me a knife or knife set as my gift, which I'll be able to take and use in my new apartment (I'll be 20, and a sophomore in college). I know very, very little about knives, and I've tried to do a little bit of research, on here and other places. From what I can tell, it seems like if I'm gonna get anything, I need to get a chef knife first and foremost. Looking up knives and knife sets has been a little intimidating though, some of the prices are crazy high, especially for my budget and the fact that I'm an absolute beginner, so I doubt I need anything super fancy.

I saw that someone mentioned that Victorinox was a good, and cheap, beginner choice. I found this: [Victorniox knife](http://www.webstaurantstore.com/victorinox-8-chef-knife-w-fibrox-handle/35340520.html). Would this really be a good choice? After seeing knives costing in the high hundreds and even thousands, I was skeptical at this being a good knife at only $23. But if it is, then that would be awesome.

If I can find a reasonably priced and quality knife set, that would be even better than just a single knife, and someone else had recommended in a comment, the brand Dexter, where I found [this](http://www.centralrestaurant.com/Sof-Grip-7-Piece-Knife-Set-c26p24874.html?cid=WSCSGOFPR973-160pla&amp;CAWELAID=1213866257&amp;catargetid=320013760000039010&amp;cadevice=c&amp;gclid=CO3x74S5u7gCFcJj7Aodni0Aaw). The price seems reasonable, and it seems like a decent set, but I have no clue if these are good knives at all.

Following some other suggestions, I found the following chef knives and knife set, all of which seemed to have good reviews and recommendations, as well as reasonable prices.

I really appreciate any and all suggestions and advice!!

After carefully working on a butter chicken recipe since yesterday I managed to screw it up in the last 10 minutes.

Not to mention that whatever yogurt landed in the pan with the chicken ended up curdling a bit, ruining the texture of the sauce. Something I'll solve with a paper towel pat down next time I try this recipe. 

Do people have any handy rules of thumb they use when they cook chicken? i.e. what size of chunks is best to preserve tenderness?

Was it just the fact that the chicken was old and had been frozen a long time maybe? 

How do you balance your paranoia of overcooking against the worry that you'll produce chunks of sawdust? 

Level of heat? 

Anything would help because this problem has plagued me for a long time, and hits whenever I try something with smaller chunks of chicken breast. It's such a fickle meat!

I thought all my problems would go away when I got a new range, but now the first batch of stuff I fry turns out great (I fry in batches so it can stay hot enough), with plenty of crisp browning goodness. After the first batch of meat is done, the bottom of the pan (stainless) will have some of those brown bits that you want to deglaze later with broth/wine/whatever, which is great, but it seems like the brown bits are not all that good at conducting heat. So after 2 batches, the surface isn't really hot enough to fry that well anymore, and the lovely brown stuff starts to turn black and is now burned (smells bad, not so good for gravy anymore). What am I doing wrong? I feel embarrassed that I don't know how to do a simple thing like fry. Am I making the pan *too* hot? I heard with stainless you have to let the meat sit there for a bit or it sticks, so I have been doing that, but inevitably there is some brown stuff that gets left behind (and I like it; gravy is noms), it's just that eventually there is an entire layer of rapidly burning brown meat bits stuck to the bottom of the pan and nothing else will fry correctly. I noticed last night when I caramelized a whole bunch of onions that for some reason even though the heat was fairly high and on for like 25-30 minutes, the brown bits on the bottom never got stuck and I could keep scraping them up and everything worked out fine. When I fry meats, do I need to lube it somehow to keep it moister like I assume the onions were?

Braising questions: I just joined a monthly ""get random cuts of meat"" thing and I got a chuck roast, and I tried braising it (first braise of my life). I braised for about 2.5 hours at 350. The meat turned out surprisingly not awful; very tasty but tough and dense. The liquid, holy smokes, best gravy and French onion soup ever. But the meat: is that the right cut of meat to braise? I understand you're supposed to cook for a long time to make the connective stuff break down, but my meat thermometer was telling me that the internal temp was getting up to 180,190 degrees. I kind of freaked out and pulled it out of the oven; should I have just let it sit there and get hotter and hotter? I'm used to eating beef at 131. 

The meat came tied with string into a tight cylinder. I seared with the string on and also braised with the string. Should I have cut the string? Would that have let more juice go back into the meat?

Should I have braised at 250 for longer or was 350 ok? Come to think about it, what's the difference between braising at 250 or 350 anyway? At some point the liquid is up to whatever the boiling point is (roughly 212 I assume) and it'll just stay there, right? Will anything cook differently?

Any other tips would be great - thanks!

We are, as the title of the community states, here to share our knowledge and to help each other become better cooks. To accomplish this goal, we do have rules to encourage quality posts and comments. I would like to clarify and reiterate our rules and guidelines here.

**Most importantly, we are not here for recipes.** There is nothing wrong with sharing your recipes, but there are better and larger subreddits like /r/recipes and /r/cooking that specialize in this sort of thing. If your posts primary goal is to receive a good recipe or to use a particular ingredient for a particular dish, you will be better off posting in either of those subreddits. Specific, detailed questions to which we can give specific, detailed answers serve our overall goals much more.

In addition, **casual culinary discussion and kitchen stories are better suited to other communities** such as/ /r/kitchenconfidential, /r/cooking or /r/chefit. Posts asking for career advice, such as what school to go to or how to get into the industry are better suited to /r/kitchenconfidential or /r/chefit. Casual questions like, “What is your favorite thing to cook?” or “What is something cheap and easy to make?” are better suited to /r/cooking. These questions get better response in other more general communities.

There is also a new rule that we became aware of. **Any post that is asking whether or not a dish is safe to consume could be construed as medical advice. This is against Reddit's site-wide ToS and thus will be removed immediately.** I know it seems foolish to have to be this extreme, but it's important, besides which, there is only one appropriate answer to the question: ""If in doubt, throw it out""

**We have a great FAQ and archive to search of previously answered questions.** Please use these to avoid reposting questions that have been thoroughly answered. Yes, it is more fun to have a conversation, but frequently repeated basic questions is what drives people otherwise eager to help to rudeness and frustration.

Lastly, when posting, **please be focused and detailed**. Provide the recipe, your technique and exact procedures you followed and ask a question as specific as possible. The better your question is, the better our answers can be.

In terms of comments, while we are not a “pros-only” community, we do have a standard of what comments are appropriate, much like /r/askscience has. Firstly, we are a more “serious” subreddit than most.** Jokes, memes, puns and off-topic comments will be removed.** All comments must be accurate, well informed and either answer the questions fully, or add interesting discussion to the topic at hand. If your comment does not fulfill these goals, it will be removed**. Short, misinformed or vague responses are not appropriate here.**

We hope you realize why these rules are necessary and need to be enforced. With our numbers currently, we as a community need to be vigilant in self-moderation. Be sure to utilize the report function for anything you find inappropriate. We have also added two new moderators to the team here. Please welcome /u/cdnchef and /u/vbm923! We hope with your help we can beat the infamous “gradual degradation of a subreddit” and keep our community on track to accomplishing our goals.

And lastly, r/askculinary participated in the reddit /r/bestof2012 this year and are happy to announce this year’s winners! Congratulations to the following:

Thanks for the advice and I'm sure I'm going to use some of it in the future to see if I can improve.

---

Hey,

I'm cooking a steak for the first time. I would estimate the last time I had a steak was at least 10 years ago.

Things I have: 

* 1 top sirloin steak. I'm sure it is shit quality. There is some marbling. It looks like it is an inch thick.
* Some cuisinart pans that I probably got from walmart.
* A stove. I don't have a grill.


This is my general plan:

1. Take the steak out of the refrigerator. Rub it with some salt and pepper. Leave it out for about an hour to get it to room temperature and make sure the salt isn't making it dry.

2. Put the pan on the stove. Get it smoking. Throw some crisco vegetable oil in there.

3. Put the steak in the pan facing away from me. This is where I get lost. I have no idea how long I need to cook the steak for. I am a little afraid of undercooking it and getting sick. I may have a meat thermometer, but let's assume that I don't. I've seen the palm method suggested to determine doneness, but I don't feel confident that I could use that method accurately. 

Any other advice is appreciated. I've read the sidebar and FAQ.

Thanks,

It's annoying, since I'm quite proud of my cooking, and especially my Italian food, but not being able to make a fantastic tomato sauce is really a weak spot.  

Here's my normal process:

-Saute an onion and garlic with olive oil until soft

-Add in a can of crushed tomatoes

-Add a bit of tomato paste to thicken

-Slowly simmer, add a splash of red wine and basil.  Salt and pepper to taste.  

That's all.  I don't see what I could do differently.

The problem's been happening recently where the sauce is too sweet, or too acidic, and absolutely nothing like the sauce that I grew up with.  When I try to add salt to balance out the acidity and sweetness it just makes it worse!

I had absolutely no laminate dough experience though a fair amount of culinary training. I'm baking in Oregon, so it is not super warm but gets above 80 somewhat regularly. I seem to be able to deal with the heat well enough but I'm having a really rough time since the outside of my croissants are somewhat ""tough."" I have changed egg wash, going from egg and cream to egg and water (At bosses request) and it didn't fix anything. I'm very careful with the amount of flour that goes into the dough as well as the amount I use on the counter when I roll out. The crumb is beautiful, exactly as it should be. It's just that darn exterior. Here is my procedure:


Make Dough (I work with 25lb at a time) It is soft but still slightly tacky. 
Proof at room temp 2 hours
Store in Walk-in overnight

The next day

Roll out using Rondo in 4 batches, Rolling out 3 trifolds, Trifold a 4th time but not rolling out.
wrap in plastic wrap
Store overnight in walk-in

Day 3

Take pillow and flatten so it will fit in Rondo. (The marking is 30 on the machine, so probably 30mm high?)
Light dusting of flour on all sides. 
Roll through, reshaping as needed and flouring top and bottom once. Down to 2 3/4.
 

Once I have rolled it out, I move it to a wood bench LIGHTLY floured. Here is where I cut and shape them. Each pillow takes me around 10 minutes to get to this point, then 20ish to cut and shape.

After all the pastries are shaped (Croissants, Bear Claws and Pan Chocolate) They go into a proofer for 2 hours. We proof at 90 degrees with humidity at 60. I share the proofer with the bread baker, so this is not really changeable.

Once they have proofed for 2 hours they get egg washed (which takes around 10 minutes to egg wash everything) then baked at 307 for 24 minutes, turning at halfway. 

 

It is ONLY the croissants that are tough on the outside, none of the other pastries have this issue. They are not hard on the outside, which would indicate too much flour... I'm really stumped. I've tried alternating my egg wash thicker and thinner.... I'm wondering if I need to bake higher (one of the old croissant bakers baked at 315) so that the steam from the butter evaporates quicker?

 

The dough/procure really can't be altered much, it's the way this bakery has done it for 35 years. I'm assuming there is just something little that I am doing/not doing that needs to be changed.

But one of the things I do really enjoy making are soups and chilis though. 

I've made my mom's chili recipe a handful of times and the girlfriend and I are wondering how we can take it to the next level. Here is the recipe:

1 1/2lbs ground bison
2 medium onions sliced
1 green bell pepper sliced
1 orange or yellow bell pepper sliced
1 large can crushed tomatoes
1 to 2 (15 oz) cans of diced tomatoes (usually use about 1.5 cans)
1 (15 oz) can of tomato sauce
1 (15 0z) can of black beans
1 (15oz) can of red beans
Several TB of chili powder (read: a shitton)
1/4 Tsp cumin
Red Pepper Flakes to taste
jalapenos sliced- optional

Brown bison. Remove from pot and set aside. Saute peppers and onions until softened.  Add meat back to pot. Then add crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, cumin and chili powder.  Simmer for at least an hour. Then add beans, spices and and jalapenos to taste. Continue simmering and fiddling with spices until everyone is starving.

Some ideas we had: 

1.) Add beer, everything is better with beer right? We were thinking of replacing some of the tomato sauce or the extra 1/2 can of diced tomatoes with a 1/2 cup of a nice smokey porter or brown ale or something. 

2.) Use better spices. I was thinking that using fresher chili powder from Whole Foods might give it a stronger flavor without having to dump in as much.

3.) Use something better than jalepenos. Or learn how to use them better. The ones I buy always have flesh that seems as mild as a green pepper, and doesn't seem to add much flavor, except for the spoonful that has a seed in it, which is like a double-barrel shot of spiciness to the chest. Maybe I should add them when I first mix it all together and give it more time to stew?

4.) Try it in the slow cooker? I'm not opposed to this, seems like it would be easier to simmer than a pot on the gas stove, but I like my vegetables to have a little texture to them still, I don't want to turn them into mush

Totally open to any suggestions. I like the idea of taking my mom's recipe that I've been eating ever since I was a kid and evolving it into my own after some experimentation. 

**EDIT:** OK, this is what I think I'll try next time: 

1.) Cook a couple strips of bacon in the pan before cooking the bison and vegetables. (My GF needs to eat lean meats so we can't go too crazy with the bacon fat)

2.) Use better spices. I'll get authentic chili powder, add more cumin, and try spicing with chipotle peppers in place of jalepenos. 

Does anyone add beer? Instead of adding it to the chili next time I think I might just make a batch of beer biscuits to go along with it. Freaking. Delicious. 

**EDIT 2:** 

Ok, everyone in here had amazing suggestions, not all of which would go well together, obviously. Here is what I think I'll attempt next time. 

1 1/2lbs ground bison
Few strips of bacon
2 medium onions sliced
1 green bell pepper sliced
1 orange or yellow bell pepper sliced
1 large can crushed tomatoes (Muir Glen Brand)
1 to 2 (15 oz) cans of diced tomatoes (Muir Glen)
1 bottle of dark beer
1 (15 0z) can of black beans (Or dry, depending on time available)
1 (15oz) can of red beans (Or dry, depending on time available)
Several TB of chili powder (Either fresh or the authentic stuff)
1 tsp cumin, bought whole and toasted
Chipotle Peppers
few cubes 85%+ dark chocolate

Cook bacon in skillet. Remove bacon and brown bison in bacon fat. Remove from pot and set aside. Saute peppers and onions until softened. Remove from pot and deglaze with bottle of beer. Add meat, veggies, beer/deliciousness reduction, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, and chipotle peppers. Simmer for at least an hour. Then add beans and chocolate. Continue simmering and fiddling with spices until everyone is starving.

Additional Questions:

For a lot of cooking/baking, I'm familiar enough with the ingredient properties/food science that I can tweak ingredients to make something more how I want it, but brownies have always eluded me. I recently found a recipe that shows promise. They were very soft, fudgey, rich, and delicious; but only chewy slightly around the edges.

[Recipe](http://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/supernatural-brownies). This is the recipe, which I changed slightly by using unsweetened chocolate, adding &lt;1/4 c extra sugar to compensate, plus ~ 2 tbsp of kalua, and baked for only 40 min instead of 45 (not a great oven, was afraid of overcooking).

Two questions:
(1) What is it that makes brownies chewy? My suspicions waffle between sugar caramelising or gluten content.

(2) Any recipe suggestions, or alterations to the above recipe? Should I have let it cook longer? Added more sugar? Did the liquid in the Kalhua mess things up? Is my only real option getting an ""all edges"" pan?

I've searched past brownie posts and they didn't seem to answer my questions, so Thanks in advance!

I make it with a pressure cooker, because it's much much faster and at least as good. One of the innovations that I've tried to add is to use chicken stock instead of water when pressure-cooking for extra flavor. Frequently this has resulted in me getting food poisoning, and I don't know why.

Chicken stock is fussy, I realize - I make it using carcasses from rotisserie chickens that I eat for dinner. I throw the bones in the freezer until I've got 2-3 chickens worth; I just now used this recipe from Saveur (with some modification) http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/From-the-Test-Kitchen-Perfect-Pressure-Cooker-Chicken-Stock but have previously used much simpler techniques (boiling the chicken bones in water for a few hours with a bay leaf). I refrigerate it overnight, skim the fat, and freeze it. It is possible that in the past I was not always diligent about freezing the carcasses (put them in the fridge instead).

So, why am I getting sick? Is there any reason why it's bad to cook with stock in a pressure cooker? Did I probably just make a bad batch last time? Are pulses and stock just generally dangerous to combine? Please halp.

Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions! A few notes: 1) Symptoms are urgent and explosive diarrhoea and some associated intestinal discomfort. Onset is the morning after and it's nasty for a few hours until basically everything is out of my system. 2) I can eat the lentils without stock just fine; never any problems.

I am particularly interested in finding the safest teachable methods for adults that still permit varying the output size, or even a couple of safe methods specific to the size of output required.

**Grid Method**

[Here's an example of what seems to me the most common method](http://youtu.be/zVr3z4HfpeI?t=11s), which I've heard called the ""grid"" method.

1. parallel vertical slices from above the onion down to the board
2. slice(s) parallel to the board
3. slice latitudinally

EDIT: Scrofuloid mentioned [this method of avoiding the parallel cut in the grid method](http://youtu.be/yP3CiyEKEfU?t=2m17s) from Helen Rennie.

EDIT: A [demo from Sur La Table](http://youtu.be/A78iGzJTLp8?t=36s) shows substantially the same approach.

EDIT: joanty mentioned [Gordon Ramsay's instructional video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGBt3V0yvc) showing the grid method, but with step 2 cuts that are angled slightly downward, toward the board.

EDIT: joanty also linked to a great Eric Crowley [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHj4a3_dVLQ) that totally skips step #2, instead rock-chopping after step #3 to get down to a fine mince.

**Fan Method**

[Here's Alton Brown doing a simpler ""fan"" method](http://youtu.be/1-6_z17MinY?t=4m40s).

EDIT: He does the same [in a promo video](http://youtu.be/cEAiC7AIXW8?t=8m50s), acknowledging it deviates from the ""textbook"" method.

**Diagonal Method**

[Saw this one today](http://youtu.be/UHQc7QUJT4o?t=2m11s), and it was totally new on me:

He's doing:

1. parallel diagonal cuts going one way
2. more parallel cuts from the opposite direction
3. perpendicular diagonal slices

Am I missing any common or special methods? Am I right to think Alton's ""fan"" method is mostly useful for avoiding the potentially dangerous cuts parallel to the board needed in the grid method? Does anyone have experience getting different size minces using something other than the ""grid"" method? Apart from going to a mandoline or other purpose-built tool, are there any other inexpensive bits of kit that might be practical to keep prep people doing a lot of volume safe?

Has nonstick coating (so it's not just straight stainless), but made with a mix of titanium and ceramic (no teflon)

5 total plys of material; disregarding the nonstick layer, it appears to be stainless steel for the exterior layers and 3 layers of aluminum inside, at least one of which goes up the sides for additional heat distribution.

Handles for pans and lids are all hollow to help keep them cool (oven-cooking obviously excluded). On the oven-cooking note, it seems like they're all 100% oven-compatible.

The website is nowhere near as professional as All-Clad's (http://www.masterclad.tv/index.php).

So I bring it home and cut it open and separate all the seeds. I eat a handful or so of the seeds, thinking, ""hmm, pretty good"" and put the rest away in a plastic tub with a little bit of water so they don't dry out.

Fast forward to about twenty minutes ago and I decide to munch on them again. That plastic bit of tupperware hasn't been opened in those five days. So when I opened it, suddenly I got this freaking HEAVENLY aroma that seriously smelled like a really sweet wine. I evened sipped the water that I poured in to keep the seeds from drying. It was sweet and delicious. And of course the pom seeds tasted SUPER sweet. Like, 10x sweeter than before.

Ingredients:

1 whole chicken

6 large onions (I LOVE onion)

3 peppers

2 handful of green peas

2 cans chopped tomatoes

Oil

Salt

Crushed chili (4 tbspns - makes it very hot)

""Madras"" hot curry powder (4 tbspns)

2x jars of pre-made curry (e.g. tikka massala, vindaloo)

Generic Mixed herbs (1 tbspn)

Recipe:

- Little bit of oil. Onions and peppers are chopped as finely as I can be bothered to, and lightly fried (browned). 

- I attack the chicken with a meat cleaver. Once I've got it down to around 8 large pieces, I rip off as much meat as possible, but of course it's not possible to get it all off the bones. *All* of the chicken goes in the pan (even the bones, ribcage, etc), and browns. These two stages (above and this) take around 30 minutes.

- After 30 minutes, I add the rest of the ingredients. The lid goes on, bring it all to the boil, and it cooks for about 4 hours. Serve with naan, fries, or of course, rice.

Now don't get me wrong, it's quite delicious (if I do say so myself) and healthy, but a few questions.

a) Are there any obvious mistakes I'm making?

b) The pre-made curry jars are quite expensive. What do you think it would be like if I simply removed them from the recipe, and maybe compensated with more of the curry powder?

I found some recipes [(Here's an example of one)](http://www.food.com/recipe/hamburger-beef-jerky-171634) for a food dehydrator suggest using a jerky gun, but I don't have one and I don't really want to buy more equipment. 

Is it possible to use a combination of the dehydrator, oven, and/or grill?  Or is there something special about the smoker?  

What makes cured meats safe to keep at room temperature? Sometimes I see them refrigerated and sometimes I see them hanging. Other than the curing salt, what else affects this?  I saw other ingredients in recipes like dry milk, lactic-acid starter culture, fermento, beer, and wine. Do these things just make it tangy? Or is there also a fermentation process that cures it? 

**tl;dr can I make beef snack sticks without a smoker or jerky gun?**

I've done some research on it, and all I could determine is that most people seem to think either one is fine (as long as you get a good quality one). Cast iron is heavier, but if you get a good one, only by a small amount, which doesn't matter to me.  
I'm leaning towards cast iron, mostly because I use cast iron skillets almost exclusively for any skillet/griddle cooking needs, and I'm now fairly experienced in caring for them, but I've also heard that carbon steel care is very similar.

I'm hoping there's some redditors out there who have used both, and could give me their opinions!

What I want to know:  

* How does the heat transfer abilities of the two compare?
* How does the non-stick properties compare?
* How does maintaining the seasoning on them compare?

I am pretty sure I'll get it from [The Wok Shop](http://www.wokshop.com/). They seem to have good reviews on Amazon, and I haven't seen anything else in that price range that has better reviews. If anyone has any recommendations though I'm open to changing my mind!

Also, I have a glass top electric stove. I'm think that will still work fine with a wok, but I'm not sure if the best one for me would be different because of that.

We followed the initial instructions of not using soap to wash the pan, or any metal objects. However, after every meal, we realised we were both getting sick. I'd have diarrhea immediately, and he would have the runs the whole day after. 

Did we treat the skillet wrongly? It looked like it was seasoned after a few times with a nice sheen on the pan and no sticking when we cooked. Does this usually happen to anyone? Is it something we're supposed to condition our stomachs to take?

Typically, we make a lot of dishes in the biggest Calphalon pan by cooking some sort of meat in oil, and throwing veggies and sauce all in the pan at some point. For instance, for a chicken curry dish, we'll cook the chicken (diced) until it's nearly done, then dump in the coconut milk and curry paste and veggies and continue to cook until the veggies are ready.

This is all backstory for the following question:  The 2 Calphalon pans that we use most often are sticking terribly now. We have been massively underutilizing the All-clad pans that we have.  **Should we get some other form of non-stick pans (ceramic?) or should we no be so afraid of the All-clad?**   For some reason, I envision it being impossible to cook meat in a stainless steel pan without sticking, and equally impossible to make something like curry in a pan without burning a lot of in to the bottom.  

Am I crazy?  Price isn't too much of an issue, but I'm trying to understand if my view of cooking meals is screwing up my idea of what I need a certain type of pan for.

Basically, every fucking google entry spews back pinch grip, pinch grip, pinch grip.  Anyway, I'm basically asking for more information.  And if I have the ideas down:

Pinch Grip:  One of the most common ones.  Provides most stability and I can't imagine rock chopping with any of the other grips.  Works on a majority of knives.  Best for rough cuts and works well for precise cuts.  Hard to cut horizontally.

Index finger extended on spine:  Supposedly really unstable(and an incorrect grip lol), but I find that to not be true.  But it definitely is less stable if cutting large or hard objects.  Due to the positioning, it's easier to twist/curve to adjust a cut.  As long as I'm push or pull cutting(without a ton of pressure), I find I can get more precise cuts.

Index finger extended on the side of the blade:  I've mostly seen this with the thumb on the spine and push-cutting, specifically for fine juliennes.  There's not much pressure, so it seems to cut very cleanly.  I find it a bit more wobbily than index finger on the spine, but I also don't have much experience with this grip.

Hammertime(and sometimes thumb on spine):  Smash.

Thing is, I have no prior culinary/cheese making experience. I've been doing this for about 3 months now, and I know *what* to do, but I'm not sure *why* I'm doing it that way. I just make it the way I was taught. I'm mostly interested in what is happening to the curd during the motions I go through. I looked through google and youtube and there are a million different ways to make mozzarella and apparently none of them are the way I do it. Everybody seems to have all of this equipment, and I do it all by hand. I'm looking for feedback/input. 

So this is how I do it:


**Step one**: I chop a 10lb curd up with a butcher knife into small chunks and toss the chunks into a metal bowl.

 **Step two**: I pour boiling water onto the chunks of curd in the bowl and let it sit for about a minute. (I always thought this was just to melt it all together, according to different things I saw online, the curd is being ""cooked"" here?)

**Step three**: I work the curd with my hands for a little bit until it's starting to stick together a little better, I add a little salt before I fold it onto itself and then the curd is starting to become one thing.

**Step four**: I basically add morton salt onto the curd each time before I fold it; and I fold it enough times until it I'm confident that it's not going to fall apart when I try to stretch it. So I salt it/fold it around 4 or 5 times. (this surprisingly doesnt end up being too much salt)

**Step five:** Everywhere I've looked online shows people stretching the curd with a paddle or something. Not I. The way I was taught to stretch it is by grabbing the curd, and lifting some of it up and letting it hang/stretch down, then I fold it onto itself. I do this probably 3 or 4 times until it has that nice shiney look and stretchy consistency.

~~From here, I don't think it's worth explaining what else goes on since it's basically packaging from here on: I craft the little balls from the curd, put them in the water one by one, wrap them in saran wrap, blah blah blah.
. 
  So that's my method. I haven't seen anyone online do it the way I described. Why am I stretching it? Is the water cooking it? etc. All criticism is welcome

My second attempt was using an entire leg from just below the shoulder and I cooked the whole thing on my grill.

* The skin: the oven left the skin kind of tough and the grill left it hard and crunchy (but not burnt). **Any advice on how to soften the skin?**

* The fat: Melted fat that coats and flavors pork = good. Big chucks of gelatinous fat = bad. The skin has rather heavy layer of fat. **What's the best way to melt that fat down?** High heat? Low and slow?

* The meat: Both times I've peeled the skin down, removed the meat from the bone. Minced it as best I can and stuffed it back in after adding some herbs and onions. The taste is great but the meat can be really inconsistent and sometimes tough or chewy. **Would using a cleaver make mincing easier / allow for a finer mince?** and **Should I pre-cook my stuffing (with or w/o meat) before stuffing or should the whole raw zampone go into the oven/on the grill?**

I've been making a lot of cured meats lately, and want to invest in a smoker. I live in an apartment, in a city, so building an outdoor smoker is currently out of the question. Has anyone here tried using a stove top smoker? If so, I have a few questions:


* How well does the vessel contain the smoke? Will I need to create some sort of exhaust beyond a measly hood fan?

* Compared to an outdoor smoker, how comparable are the results? Is it even worth it?

* If smokers are worth it, what's the ideal product line? I personally like no frills, durable cooking vessels, but if a particular brand stands out I think in this case I'd check it out.

My biggest concern is getting a smoke that is out of control and flooding my entire apartment with smoke. If I lived in a condo, or a house I would not mind, but having neighbors above, below, and to each side of me, I don't think even the finest charcuterie would fix a visit from the fire department.

Thanks a million!

I should make an effort to pat the wings dry, right? Also, I don't have one, should I get like a fry-basket insert or something? Or would I be fine just using one of those large mesh frying ladle thingies?

I've been practicing, and taking note of which recipes deal with each other well, but I have trouble with the timing, and with selecting dishes that have distinct and complementary flavor. I don't know how do you choose the dishes that go well together and don't compete for the same resources and attention in the preparation process.

.

Can you offer me any advice?

____________________
Greetings, from the land of spätzle and jellied meats, where making American treats is a study in MacGyver-like creativity!

I need glucose syrup, my friends, but I live in Germany where stores don't carry standard American ingredients, close before the sun sets, and are never open on Sundays. 

I plan on making some things from the Momofuku Milk Bar cookbook [(example cookie recipe)](http://www.the-baker-chick.com/2011/12/30/confetti-cookies/), which calls for glucose (or corn syrup in a pinch), neither of which are readily available here. A basic search for alternatives gave me this [cane sugar syrup](http://www.thekitchn.com/pantry-staples-diy-cane-sugar-131934). 

My questions: 

*Is this a suitable alternative? 

*If so, should I use a 1:1 ratio? The cookie recipe doesn't call for much glucose (50 grams), but as I understand it, glucose is not as sweet as standard table sugar, so how heavily could the sugar syrup impact the sweetness? 

*Does anyone have an opinion on whether this could be used as a substitute in every application of glucose/corn syrup?


Note: Pharmacies allegedly carry glukosesirup, so all is not lost if I can't make my own, but I've already been (happily!) forced into self-sufficiency by making my own brown sugar, vanilla extract, and baking powder, so I kinda *want* to do this.

Edit: I noticed that article with the cane sugar syrup states that it was used to replace corn syrup in other recipes, but I'm asking about it here because, well. I don't always trust blogs? I saw one the other day claiming, in no uncertain terms, that one should never brine pork. ಠ_ಠ",,False,,t5_2t82m,1367336377.0,,,True,t3_1dekdr,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1dekdr/homemade_sugar_syrup_a_viable_alternative_for/,

* Different oils (Grape seed, Vegetable, Canola, Olive)
* Eggs at room temparature and refridgerated
* Two egg yolks instead of one
* Omitted water
* Different containers (see pictures below)
* Two different blenders, one with a circular ""whipping"" blade

*When I make it by hand in a wisk and bowl, it works fine. It's a bit more yellow, but that's it.*

The popcorn-like souffle isn't burnt, but rather I used a mixture of cocoa and sugar to coat the ramekins, which got taken along for the ride upwards.

I've been trying to get my Pho up to good big-city restaurant standards for half a year.  

Recently, someone who works at an Asian restaurant suggested roasting the stock bones at 300 F with star anise for hours, and to deglaze the roasting pan with mirin.  Only after will he simmer the bones.  This is definitely tasty, but I'm not sure how authentic this technique is.  

Adding a couple of onions to the broth before boiling for hours, seems to taste great. Some recipes call for burning the onion in fire, and some don't.  But, a friend insisted her Vietnamese mother never used onions.   Also she insisted on NOT using fish oil.

Also, a friend who visited Vietnam insisted that the best restaurants put a light stir fry on the noodles before pouring the broth.  This certainly makes a big difference, and leaves the Pho tasting much richer.  The chef in this [Anthony Bourdain Video seems to be doing just that, adding a stir-fry before the broth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsSiA-JHm0U).  But even with the stir-fry technique, is it acceptable to use any hoisin in the stir fry?  I read elsewhere that the hoisin is only for dipping the meat in, and the broth is supposed to be perfect.

I've tried a half dozen different approaches, all delicious, but I'm still not sure what is taking me closer to perfect, Vancouver Canada restaurant-level Pho.  My spice bag is usually star anise, cinnamon, cloves, coriander and all spice.  I usually simmer ox bones for 3 hours. I haven't tried shin bones yet, but I've been told they're better.  I'm happy with my rice noodles.

Last night was the worst I've ever experienced though: It was so rubbery and chewy, it almost felt *crunchy* (not crispy-crunchy). It was doubly mystifying because the other two breasts in my baking dish came out completely fine.

The details:

* I'm using boneless, skinless chicken breasts (Perdue, if that helps)

* Often they are frozen, removed from the freezer and thawed a bit first (using a setting on the microwave), only just enough that the chicken is pliable and can be sliced, beaten, etc.

* Happens with all kinds of baked chicken: marinaded chicken, lightly breaded chicken, etc.  Doesn't seem to be a common ingredient across the board.  Last night's chicken was a coconut milk and lime juice-based marinade.

* Each time the chicken is baked to at least 164F.

* I am usually baking my chicken at 350F until they reach that temperature (usually 40-ish minutes?) in a gas oven.

* I am using a glass pyrex dish coated in foil.

* I allow the chicken to sit after removing from the oven for at least 5 minutes.

I absolutely loved the marinade I used yesterday, but the texture of the chicken ruined the meal for my family.  One breast out of the three I baked was a complete rubbery mess--it was difficult to even cut into it!

On a whim I had just stopped into our local co-op yesterday and used their grinder for a fresh batch of smooth peanut butter. Fate! Crispy peanut butter cookies were clearly my destiny tonight. 

Alas, fate is a fickle mistress and, unbeknownst to me, we've recentlly gotten into dire straits on the butter front, along with with the rest the more all-purpose cooking oils in the kitchen.

Now, I do have a couple other options on hand that could possibly be used as a functional substitute, either on their own or in conjunction with the cream cheese (or maybe each other), though I've never used any of them for this purpose. I have a dab of lard left from making pies over the holidays, probably slightly less than 1/4 cup. Also, I have a nearly full container of coconut oil I picked up recently to experiment with (having never cooked with it before), which has barely been touched. There's easily 3+ cups of that available to be used. It appears we're out of any other neutral-flavored cooking oils, and I'm guessing that the varieties of olive oil I have on hand, even the extra light, would add flavor that just wouldn't work for cookies.

So, with the specific short-term goal of satisfying my random late night craving for cookies, I'm definitely open to general suggestions or specific recommendations on what can be pulled off with the oils I have on hand.

In terms of long-term learning, though, I'm curious if/what/how cream cheese could be used as a possible substitute for butter, and for what type(s) of applications. This could be on its own or as a composite with other ingredients.

Looking forward to hearing any input folks may have on either front!

What's the best preparation for these? I'm in NJ, so the BBQ is out (otherwise I'd need no help). I'm also fairly decent with stir-fry recipes, but I'm looking for something different and comfort-y to try. 

I'd love to do something like a braise/simmer that'll end up letting the meat fall off the bone (I need to cut the meat up for my daughter), but it needs to be non-dairy (for me) and kid-friendly. 

I have a bunch of leftover rice already made, and some veggies that can be cooked with or alongside the chicken. 

Any ideas?

UPDATE:

Man, you folks have good ideas!  I ended up basing the final idea off of /u/X28's post.  Here's what I did:

Put salt and paprika on three thigh/leg combos (the biggest pan I have can only accommodate three) and put them in the pan with some olive oil.  

After browning, I removed the chicken to a bowl and put diced uncooked bacon in the pan.  Once that was cooked most of the way through, I strained it through a paper towel into a bowl.  

I deglazed the pan with some red wine vinegar, and threw in finely chopped onions and some minced garlic (from a jar).  When the onions started to get translucent, I put some of the bacon/chicken grease in the pan and added diced carrots and celery, along with Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute (man, that stuff's awesome).  I let that stuff all mix and mingle for a bit, then added the chicken back in along with some frozen peas and some of TJ's Broccoli &amp;amp; Carrot Slaw (just happened to have that in the fridge sitting around).  Finally, I put chicken stock in the pan and covered it with a large bowl (we don't have a cover big enough for the pan).

I'm simmering that on low/medium low and plan on keeping that going for the next couple of hours.  I will report back with the results!

Thanks to all!

UPDATE #2:

Success! I pulled the chicken out of the pan after about 2 hours, when I discovered the chicken had been heated to just over 200 degrees (almost oops).  I took off the skins and pulled the meat from the bones (super easy). Meanwhile, I added some salt and pepper to the liquid in the pan and reduced it a whole bunch to create a nice sauce.  

With respect to my little girl's finickiness, I put some of the chicken on a plate next to the rice and some frozen corn I heated up. I also gave her some carrots, peas and celery from the pan, but not unexpectedly, she wanted nothing to do with those. She really liked the chicken, and that's all I could have hoped for. 

As for me, I put a bed of rice on the plate, piled some chicken on that, and covered everything in the sauce. Holy cow. Really rich and savory, with a nice depth of flavor (thanks in no small part to the bacon suggestion). I'm sure it'll never be on anyone's list of healthiest dishes, but 10/10 WOULD EAT AGAIN.

I pulled it for at least 15 minutes, if not more. I had to reheat it a couple times in the microwave (10 seconds). Now that it's done, it is too hard. It softens in your mouth to a chewable point, but if you tried to chew it after you first put it in your mouth you would break a tooth.

Where did I go wrong?

I  
Heated to 260 degrees F.  
Poured it out and let it cool. I tried to start pulling too soon, the taffy was too hot to handle. I let it cool longer, trying it every 30-45 seconds until it was cool enough to handle.  
During the cooking stage, I heated on medium, stirred until dissolved, then raised the temp. Once it started boiling, I lowered the temp to medium low. I did stir it once at this point, as it was getting a lot of bubbles at the top and I was afraid it would boil over.

Would that single stir during boiling have caused this?  
Or starting to pull to early?

I did check my thermometer to make sure it was accurate; boiling water showed 211.6 degrees, so I don't think that was the issue.
Should I try a lower temp, like 255 next time? or a higher temp? Reading recipes online, I see temps for taffy anywhere from 250-270 degrees.

Sometimes when I cook meat (particularly lamb shanks) using the oven it comes out very stiff, and the sauce that I've laid on it pretty much evaporates. Now I'm wondering, does covering the meat help retain the moisture? What other effects does covering meat have? I am debating whether or not to buy a cover for my oven pan. Or does using an oven bag have the same effect?

Additionally, could anyone briefly explain the different ways of using an oven? From what I've heard, grilling is heat from the bottom, broiling is heat from the top. What about the difference between baking and roasting? Also, my oven has a ""rotisserie"" setting but there are no moving parts in it, what could that be used for?

His recipe has won several competitions. My chili is untested in a competitive sense.

My current plan is to do chili three ways -- a standard tomato-and-beef chili, a white chicken chili, and a vegetarian chili.

On the chicken chili and the veggie chili, I'm pretty confident. However, on the standard chili, I'm not sure that I can really stand out. I know that that's his prize-winner, and I'm looking for some subtle variations that can help me push it over the top.

A couple ideas I have:
- Throwing some ground lamb in with my beef. I love the flavor of lamb and I think it'll be a nice accent.
- Using some kind of beer or liquor, but I really have no idea where to begin here. I think a nice porter could really deepen the flavor, but I'm just clutching at straws.

EDIT: Not enough time to respond to the huge amount of comments and tips here, so I'd like to thank you all here. I'll condense the advice I've gotten that I intend to follow below:

- Dark chocolate. Many of you seem to be big fans of the stuff in chili, and it's been such a huge overtone that I'll definitely be trying it out.

- Finely diced meats as opposed to ground meats. Never used this strategy before, but I think it will give a nice toothsomeness to the dish and I'll definitely be using this strategy as well.

- Using a ton of diverse peppers to get a much more intricate flavor.

Its forming not just on the face, but along the handle where the metal meets the rubber (I assume moisture is getting trapped between those two parts).

So what's going on with my knives? I'm rather annoyed that we spent so much money on these knives when they clearly are not ""no stain"" as described. Are we doing something wrong in washing them, or did we just buy a crappy set of knives? Should I return them to the store or contact Calphalon?


EDIT 5/30/2013:
Thank you to everyone who responded with helpful information. This was our first time shopping for knives on our own (our last set was a wedding gift) and clearly there was a lot we didn't know to look for (nor did the store clerk that helped us, apparently). Definitely didn't know about Bar Keepers Friend.

We found the store receipt and plan to return the knives today. Instead of another big set we will probably look for a good quality chef's knife and parer, as some has suggested, plus some steak knives for dining.

My last round ended up a bit dry, which I think was due to underestimating how much liquid the noodles (precooked, but just to al dente) would still soak up. It also tasted a bit bland. Cheesy and such, but kind of meh. Generally I cook the pasta, make the sauce, mix it all up, top with cheese, and bake at 375 for about 20 min. 

My sauce is as below:

3 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1/4 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon paprika, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, 2 cups 2% milk, 1 clove roasted garlic, 2 cups grated medium cheddar cheese. 

I have to make it tonight, refrigerate it, and then reheat it for lunchtime tomorrow. I want to make sure it doesn't get too dry by then too, so I was going to increase the milk a bit. 

Would appreciate any and all suggestions. I want to improve!! 


*Update edit:*
I kinda ran out of time to try everything I wanted, and had to rely on my lovely boyfriend to do most of the ingredient shopping, but I think it turned out nicely. 

I essentially started with the Bechamel sauce, as suggested, only I cooked some diced onion in the butter first. Then I added some Dijon, some hot sauce, salt, pepper, paprika, olive oil that I had roasted garlic in earlier, and a teensy bit of ketchup (don't shoot me, I tasted it and it was exactly what it needed). 

I added the cheese after (a mix of smoked Gouda and old cheddar mostly, and some odds and ends from the cheese shelf). I layered some marble cheddar in with the saucy noodles. I'll add a topping tomorrow when it gets baked before lunch. 

The flavour profile is much better. There's depth and complexity, and the texture is much more pleasing. From the browned onions and other ingredients, I got a beautiful golden colour to the sauce. I am really pleased, but still think it can improve with better planning.

There was a bit of a disaster with a jelly bag collapsing and losing about half the liquid on the floor, but other than that it seems fine. I'm at the extent of leaving it in the fridge for the last 2 days. The only difference is that I put 2 tbsp of raisins in the mixture to begin with.

I tried some just now and observations: 
 
* seems rather weak (both flavour and alcoholically; last one isn't an issue)  
* Mine is signficantly more cloudy than shown  
* Mine is much lighter in colour - a beige-y, light brown rather than a deeper, yellow brown.

 
I noticed that the rye bread in the picture is very dark; the stuff I got was much lighter - did I maybe only use partially rye-flour bread?  
I used quick-action yeast designed for breadmakers and hand-baking..is that the right kind?  
Any other recommendations or things I could do differently next time to try and get a better tasting drink? It's great at the moment (not much fizz, probably as it needs to sit another day) but in the future I'd like to have it with more flavour.

FWIW, I'm willing to put in whatever prep time is needed on the front end. 

-Beef or chicken (any cuts)
-Sweet potato
-Broccoli
-Quinoa and/or bulghur

-Would like to keep a roughly even ratio across these items, with an emphasis on keeping grains at less than 1/3 of entire dish
-Assume liberal use of salt, pepper, olive oil (within reason), whatever spices and aromatics, etc. 

How would you do it? I've been working on my own variations that I'll keep to myself for now, but I will note that microwaving meat without it getting all gross has been the most vexing part.

It browned nicely, and I think I'd like to try it again, but that doesn't seem to be packaged as such very often in my area.

I've never asked a butcher to grind meat for me, but what should I ask for? Coarse ground? Is there an extra-coarse? Should I ask for a specific cut? Or would stew meat or chopped cubes work through their grinder?

It doesn't have to be the best steak in the world... My chili recipe has a lot of stuff going on, so the beef is there more for substance than its own flavor.

AMA.""",Pandanleaves,62,18,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/13r8u3/followup_to_i_became_a_millionaire_by_selling/,"[Original thread here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/138tpd/i_became_a_millionaire_by_selling_fried_chicken/)

For those that missed it, I am organizing all the common questions and answers into this thread. My grandmother is celebrating her birthday today so I spent the whole day with her. I got her to answer the newer questions and provide more details.



&gt;Why did she decide to sell fried chicken?

At the time my grandparents were poor and didn't know what to do for a living. My grandfather tried being a bus driver and my grandmother tried making confectionery, but they didn't provide good income. My grandma noticed that fried chicken (two MAJOR restaurants) was selling very well in other areas, so she decided to give it a try. She started selling chicken on her front lawn using makeshift tents and it sold unexpectedly well. She needed more space so decided to move down the street to a bigger place, which became a big open-air restaurant.



&gt;How did she create the recipe?

She experimented in her own house. She tasted the competitors' fried chicken and guessed the seasonings and adjusted it to her own tastes. In her recipe is a secret ingredient not used by other restaurants (to her knowledge) purely through trial and error. When she first made the fried chicken, they turned out extremely rubbery but quickly created her own process of making the chicken tender and juicy.

For further explanation, the fried chicken is not like KFC's chicken. The common traditional recipe is to simmer chicken in spices until the water has completely evaporated and the chicken is coated with the spices. These are then quickly fried upon order to get a crisp exterior.



&gt;What chicken did she use?

We refer to the chickens as ""ayam kampung"", literally ""village chicken"", prized for the rich flavor even though they don't have as much meat. They are free range and transported in bamboo cages. The chickens are still alive when delivered in the morning. They are butchered at the restaurant and sold within the day. They never touched the fridge (remember that the entire batch of chicken is cooked and spiced in the morning, so no risk for spoilage.)



&gt;What are the details of the restaurant? Cost structure? Customers?

The restaurant was located near a main plaza(?), which were malls before there were actual malls. The plaza had many sidestreet vendors selling bags, sandals, etc., things you would normally find in a mall. Naturally a ton of the shoppers looked for food, and, well, there is this one fried chicken joint nearby. 

The restaurant, during its glory days, went through about 100 whole chickens per day. During busy days, such as weekends, the restaurant could sell up to 200 whole chickens. Back then people were less fussy about the ""undesirable"" parts, so chicken hearts, livers, intestines, heads, and butts sold reasonably well (in fact, chicken butts sold so well they would often run out). When my grandma first started out, she had trouble with inventory, mainly the charcoal. Back then there were no gas burners, so she had to heat her wok of oil with charcoal and would often run out.

When I asked what her margins were, I was surprised. Then again, she did not have to pay rent since she owned the building. Her net profit margin was close to 50%. Keep in mind this was decades ago when restaurants didn't have to worry about competitors.



&gt;What did you learn about food after those years?

Quality is important. Back when she first started there were no big competitors, so even if she screwed up once in a while it was fine. However, the restauran industry is saturated right now. Customers have so many different choices. She regrets a lapse in quality and consistency after the main cook retired, which made her lose many loyal customers.



&gt;When did you start cooking?

She didn't know how to cook until she married my grandfather. He complained incessantly about her cooking and admitted to breaking down in tears once. She felt like she worked her hardest to prepare food but her husband didn't appreciate it. So she learned cooking from her mother-in-law. 



&gt;What is essential in Indonesian cooking?

Fragrance is important in Indonesian cooking. We use lots of shallots and garlic, fermented shrimp in many forms, as well as soy sauce and fish sauce. 

Indonesians love sweet flavors and sweet soy sauce is indispensable. Different brands have different flavor profiles. The restaurant has used the same locally produced soy sauce for decades--others just don't taste the same.

When I have had these in restaurants or even shop bought ones from the freezer they are always more moist which I think helps to carry the flavour better.

I'm hoping some of you could help me with something. We love stuffed peppers because they are frugal to purchase and easy to prepare. However, I've tried orange and green bell peppers and they turn out water-logged and bitter. The stuffing is great (rice, beans, cheese, onions, corn, tomatoes, etc.) but what is the point of having stuffed peppers if we don't eat the peppers? So I'm wondering if any of you have the same problems with your peppers and how you remedy the situation. I'm also considering stuffing large poblano peppers (ala chili rellenos style) so any tips for that would be awesome too. I've thought about baking them empty for a few minutes before I stuff them...how do you feel about that?

* The Cheese: I figure cheese wiz is the best here as it's already 'melty'. Just heat and serve in a bowl to drizzle on.

-1 tsp of sugar

-1 cup warm water

For the last week or so, I've been learning slowly how to cook a steak through trial and error (so many errors... haha). But I'm a bit curious about the oil, and I have read the faq. 

I'm working with rump steaks and alternate between a small Tefal pan and a large cast iron pan (I think its cast iron). I alternate the oils between olive and canola (completely random, but usually use canola)

Following Heston's recipe, I turn my gas cooktop to max high, and wait until some smoke comes out of the empty pan, before adding my oil and then my steak a few seconds later. After reading some food theory, I realise now that for high heats I should probably be using peanut oil, which kinda makes me wonder why Heston uses Olive oil in his recipe and why he says to wait until the oil is smoking hot? Wouldn't that mean the oil has reached smoking point and has started to degrade and become toxic? 
http://www.channel4.com/4food/recipes/chefs/heston-blumenthal/hestons-perfect-steak
Also a couple of extra questions but:
Generally, how hot do gas cooktops go on max?
Also, I like to 'try' to baste my steak with butter like Gordon Ramsay does, but am also aware of butter's low smoking point. Am I just meant to try and baste the steak as quick as I can before the butter burns/reaches its smoking point?

Both batches were good enough that all were eaten.  Looking at the pans, the caramel for batch 2 was a little over done. The batch 2 method is superior for letting the cook sleep later, but needed more than thirty minutes in a morning cold kitchen to get warm enough to bake well at 375.

Some things that don't require refrigeration would be good, as fridge space will of course be at a premium. The wedding is on the Saturday and I have the Thursday and Friday to cook, so anything that can't keep for a day or two would also not be appropriate. (I am a guest at the wedding and wouldn't be cooking on the wedding day).

Some of my ideas so far are as follows:

""Peanut Butter and Jellies"" from *The French Laundry Cookbook* - Peanut Butter and Chocolate truffles, Yuzu and Grape Jellies.

Some form of miniature tart: at the moment I'm thinking blind-baked pate brisee shells, with creme patisserie, bittersweet chocolate and stewed apricots.

Macarons - Eggshell blue to fit with the wedding theme, although not sure on flavour.

Any ideas would be much appreciated, as would tips for cooking at this scale (this is bigger than I have done before).

Last NYE instead of going out and partying, my friends and I got together and did a pretty awesome meal.  
Here is the menu we did: http://i.imgur.com/3mMul.jpg
It was so great last year, we want to do it again this year.  We would like to step away from some of the foods we did last year and try some new things.  
Do any of you have any recipes or places to find recipes that just scream decadence?

Edit: Actually, the addition of a theme was suggested and is a great idea. As far as budget, we spent about $45 per head last year and had a great dinner. This year will probably be the same. Time is really not prohibitive. We can cook all day if we like. Last year we did the soups and a lot of prep work the day before. 10 people are coming this year. I'm not sure what my skill is. I can cook, and I can follow directions. I try my best to be an Iron Chef. :D I would just like to improve on moving from one dish to the next and having the meal work well together. Last year was thrown together at the last minute and while it was wonderful, it didn't really have a flow. I'd like to work with duck this year, and have never done so before, so tips on that would be great.

I'm a huge Tabasco sauce fan. For years I've wanted to try to make my own Tabasco-like sauce but experiment with other peppers, etc.

It appears to me that, on the web, the ""DIY Tabasco"" recipes can be divided into simple, quick recipes that bear no resemblance to actual Tabasco (no salt ferment, simmering, adding water, etc) or those that sound legit but appear to have not been tested by the author (""we think putting this in an old wine barrel would help"", mentioning a 6 month ferment but not how it tasted afterwards, etc).

Has anyone made a Tabasco-style sauce that includes a long salt fermentation, oak, and addition of vinegar at bottling time? I'd like some advice on what I'm planning to do.

I will be taking several pounds of fresh red chillies of a few varieties (probably some combo of Birdseye, Thai red, habanero and whatever else I can find - can't get fresh Tabascoes where I live). The plan is to process them well, throw them in a plastic beer fermenter along with a liberal amount of salt and a handful of fresh wine oak chips/cubes, and then leave them for about 3-6 months. After tasting, I will strain via cheesecloth, combine 1 part pepper juice with 4 parts vinegar, and bottle.

Has anyone done anything like this, or perhaps some other salt ferment like sauerkraut, and can give me advice? I have a few questions.

- one recipe I read said that for the entire duration of the ferment you should have the mix in a sterile fermenter with an airlock, beer brewing style. Is this necessary? Surely the salt keeps nasties out, and McIlhenny don't do anything like this (they do apparently cap their barrels with a big layer of salt though). I've also seen sauerkraut recipes where you need to cover the surface of the fermenter with cheesecloth and skim regularly, will I need to do that?

- has anyone tried oaking a chilli sauce? I can't make out actual oak flavors in Tabasco but assume they must be part of the profile that sets it apart. I'm planning on using about double the chips that a winemaker would use for a well-oaked red, scaled down to my batch size. Is 3-6 months going to be long enough to develop?

- any advice on chillies to use or stay away from? I know Tabascoes are juicier than most supermarket chillies, so I'll look for good juicy chillies.

- any advice on vinegar to use? I'm planning on using plain white vinegar but may experiment with some other types like cider or red wine.

- With this type of ferment will my end product be approximately the heat of the original peppers, or will I lose some heat during fermentation? It would be a disaster for me to produce a sauce less hot than Tabasco.

- any idea on salt qty that will both support the ferment and result in an end product that is about as salty as Tabasco (260 mg sodium / 17g)? Based on my numbers and a 1:4 dilution, I get 0.687 cups of salt per kilogram of peppers, but that assumes I'll get 100% of that weight in the end product, which obviously I won't. I'm assuming I'll get 50% extraction which leads me to 0.344 cups of salt per kilo. Is that enough?

Any assistance appreciated! I'll post my findings here when the experiment is complete.",,False,,t5_2t82m,False,,,True,t3_1bts1r,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1bts1r/has_anyone_actually_made_tabascostyle_sauce/,

",RebelWithoutAClue,49,8,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/17m8yz/anyone_else_fry_shrimp_shells/,"Awhile ago there was a post voicing some frustration that kitchens weren't removing the tail on a shrimp when the rest of the shell was already removed. It sparked a debate upon the merits of leaving the shell on entirely with separate camps preferring the presentation of shrimp with nothing to clean on the plate vs. the appealing taste that you lose when you strip the shell. 

I find myself in the middle, personally preferring shell on, but sometimes serving shrimp with shell and tail removed for certain guests who don't like dealing with the stuff.

Last night I tried something different because I had some time on my hands. I was crisping some shallots to serve with the shrimps as a topping and I decided to throw the shells in with the shallots to try to get the toasted shell taste in with the topping. I stripped the shells and tails in large pieces to make them easy to pick out (instead of having to pick out tiny bits of stuff) and toasted them with the shallots and it turned out excellently. 

I could achieve a deeper toast on the shells than usual because I wasn't worried about overcooking the meat inside and the water content in the meat wasn't quenching the shells. I also rinsed the toasted shells in the extra shrimp meat marinade which I used to deglaze the pan after the meat was seared up nice to recover extra shrimpy goodness. I think a lot of the toasted taste from the shells might be from the little bits of meat in the legs we usually don't end up eating.

I'm at 5,000 feet, but frosting recipes don't usually require much adjusting. I'm using a ganache recipe from the cookbook ""Pie in the Sky."" I have friends coming in this weekend, so I decided to bake a cake. It was a little crumbly when it came out of the oven, but still servable. 

Then I made the ganache. 2 cups chocolate, 2 cups heavy cream. It emulsified on the double boiler, but when I was beating it in an ice water bath, it got really hard. I tried to spread it, but it literally flaked off the cake. Ok. I googled that, and decided to warm it up and add some more cream. When I was mixing that in, the whole thing separated and looked curdled and I realized I had over beaten it. Sigh. These things happen.

This morning I picked up some more heavy cream and set out to remake the ganache. I used a different brand of chocolate this time, and I slightly increased the ratio of cream to chocolate. It didn't emulsify quite as well as last night- I could still see tiny flecks of chocolate. I beat it in ice water until it started to thicken, then took it out and beat it at room temperature until it was spreadable. The ganache never got to stiff peaks, but it held soft peaks and I was happy that it wasn't rock hard. This time, when I went to spread it on the cake, I realized it was *separating* in the bowl! I got it on the cake as best I could, but the texture was weird (gloppy) and it looks really amateurish. 

WTF, ganache?! What is going on? Is the dry desert air messing it up? Why was it so hard last night? Why wouldn't it emulsify this morning? How does it appear over beaten again, when it never reached stiff peaks?

It's citrusy, savory, and creamy (but not thick!) with just a enough spiciness and goes well with the sweetness of the corn. A very good summer dish. Serve warm or cold. I didn't follow the recipe's measurements exactly, just made sure that the dressing tasted delicious and that it just **coated** the corn, not drowned it (the key was balancing the ratio of mayonnaise to lime juice). I also cut up and added some boneless, skinless chicken breasts to the mix; however, I cut the chunks too big and so the large chunks of chicken 'overwhelmed' the flavors and textures of the corn salad in that a lot of surface area of the chicken went to waste (i.e. they were to thick).

I'm interested in making about 15 portions worth of pasta and taking it with me for a weekend trip.

When I make pasta, I usually have a little extra that ends up leftover and drying on a rack. The dozen extra strands of pasta are always extremely fragile and would shatter/break with the slightest handling; it would dry around the wooden dowel it is hanging on and snap around the dowel usually. It would shatter from a one inch drop. I suspect if I placed them all in a large tupperware container a decent amount of it to break in a three hour car ride. Is this common? The fresh, dried pasta from specialty shops always seem so sturdy and can handle shipment. What can I do differently?

The recipe I use each time varies, but it's something around 2 cups of all-purpose flour to 3 egg yolks. I kneed by hand, let rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature, and then use a hand crank to do the rest. I also have a KitchenAid I can use to kneed the dough, is that recommended when making 15 portions? Should I use different flour? I tend to be a little conservative with the flour when rolling out the rested dough and getting it shaped. Should I be more liberal about reflouring when running it through the pasta machine?

I mean how would some people really know? 

SO How can people know what they get is actually real Wagyu ?

------------------------------
Edit;

Seems some people are confused about what is Wagyu and such;

Wagyu is a breed of cattle that originated from Asian cattle being crossbred with European
and British cattle around 200 years ago, in Japan.  But later on Australia
and america was given semen and embryos of Wagyu cattle from Japan to allow to cultivate their
own. America has cros bred this Wagyu breed with the famous Angus Cattles to create a 
US version to the famous Kobe Beef, which is a specific type of Wagyu breed in Japan. While Australia was later on given its own live cattle's from japan to cultivate and breed.

Currently Australia cultivates the largest herd of Wagyu cattle outside of Japan and provides it to international markets.

The features of Wagyu beef is that is has more Marbeling - intramuscular fat (IMF) - &amp; softer fat, which provides the taste and juiciness to the meat that is superior to regular meat.

I have tried a recipe a couple of times now which I think sounds delicious, but I can't get it quite right. I found it [here](http://www.pureimajennation.com/2013/03/breakfast-boats.html).

For those of you who don't want to read a whole recipe blog page, the recipe is (from the site):

Makes 2:
2 loaves of French Bread 
6 eggs
¼ cup milk
⅛ cup whipping cream
8 strips bacon
¾ cup gruyère cheese
dozen cherry tomatoes
grated parmesan for topping
salt + pepper

Preheat oven to 400°F

Cook and roughly chop strips of bacon

Cut out the guts of the french bread. Use whatever method you prefer, I pretended like I was hollowing out a canoe. Be careful not to cut through the bottom of the loaf. You don't want your boat to sink, or even worse - eggs leaking out all over the place.

Whisk together eggs, milk and whipping cream. Stir in gruyère cheese and sprinkling of salt and pepper. 

Line baking sheet with parchment paper, place loaves on top. 

Divide egg and cheese mixture equally into your canoes, sprinkle half of your bacon on each, dot with cherry tomatoes. 

Cook for 25 minutes until golden brown and eggs are fluffy and cooked through. 

Cool for few minutes, cut into 2-inch slices and devour.  

------

But I haven't been able to get it right. The eggs do NOT cook through that quickly and remain runny even after 45 minutes in the oven, at which point the french loaf becomes a bit burnt and crusty. I eat it then, and it's still delicious (I don't mind my eggs a bit runny), but I would really like it to keep together like this recipe says it should.

I will admit that I have not included the whipping cream, since it was the only ingredient I didn't have around and I figured I could get by without it. Is that what I'm missing here? Would it make that much of a difference?

What am I missing?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPIrqln8jak

Basically, we just bought a new house that came with an induction cooktop. It works GREAT on cast iron and you just hear this low pitch hum. It heats up super fast and works wonderfully.

But last night we bought a new set of analon pots and pans. It makes a really high pitched sound that makes me wonder if there is a problem with them. Any advice?

Here is a link for reference: http://www1.macys.com/shop/product/anolon-nouvelle-copper-cookware-11-piece-set?ID=633467&amp;CategoryID=11354#fn=sp%3D1%26spc%3D92%26ruleId%3D65%26slotId%3D4

Also, when I put it on a lower setting, it sounds like it's turning off and on repeatedly...is this to be expected? 

***UPDATE***
I just spoke with a person from Themador and showed them the video. Induction capable isn't the same as induction ready I guess. They said that my pans simply didn't work which was causing the noise and also meant that it's not cooking efficiently. The lower settings don't really work properly either. 

So I guess I need to go buy a new pair of pots and pans!

Her typical order if we hit up wing night will be 6 in typical wing sauce and another 12 in two dry rub styles if available, maybe 6 in some sort of Asian sauce if not.

She also always asks for them to be done extra crispy. I'm not opposed to frying, but I found [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ycy06/how_can_i_make_baked_buffalo_wings_crispier/) here with some ideas for getting them crispy in the oven.

I think that I am leaning toward Kenji's [method](http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/02/the-best-baked-buffalo-chicken-wings-in-oven-not-fried-appetizers.html) over other ideas because [the recipe](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/the-best-buffalo-wings-oven-fried-wings-recipe.html) seems very simple.

How would I incorporate a dry rub into this though, or maybe there is another way? It seems like it would be a problem if the wings are supposed to be thoroughly and evenly coated in a mixture of salt and baking powder to then also coat them in something else.

Could I just change step 3 (Add chicken wings and cook for 20 minutes. Flip wings and continue to cook until crisp and golden brown, 15 to 25 minutes longer.) to something like cooking 20 then 15 on each side, take them out, toss in spices, and give 3-5 more minutes on each side? Maybe the comment about basting with a little oil has merit too, got me.

There's an Amish market nearby and I expect they have wings, so I was going to get them there because they should taste better. I'm hoping to find whole wings and try butchering them [like so](http://parentables.howstuffworks.com/chow/be-your-own-butcher-how-cut-chicken-wings.html) I guess, so I can save the tips because I want to also try making real stock soon. I just mention this because it seems like these wings will be drier outside than defrosted ones if it matters.

Finally, what are some ideas on spices to use? I plan on making ~2lb. of wings 3 or 4 ways, one being just plain with standard wing sauce. I have blood oranges right now, so I might also try some sort of glaze with those and some Asian flavors like ginger for another wet style.

I know she liked lemon pepper at some restaurant which closed so that is probably going to be one choice. I actually don't have any lemon pepper, so I might just make my own out of fresh cracked pepper and lemon essential oil (basically where zest gets its flavor). 

Maybe this would be ""compact"" enough that I could just have it go along with the salt/baking powder mixture for the whole time in the fridge. If I choose something for the 4th variety more like a BBQ rub with brown sugar, it might not be though.

I'm also considering a za'atar rub but I realized the sumac in it is acidic, so that would be antithetical to what the baking powder is supposed to be doing maybe. So, the main question again is when do I get these rubs on? I guess adding the za'atar right before cooking could be okay, but maybe it will still taste better adding near the end or even after cooking.",,False,,t5_2t82m,False,,,True,t3_17xdgc,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/17xdgc/dry_rub_hot_wings_techniques/,

Is there a good way to replicate that kind of cooking, only at home?

I mix it, knead it, wait, and then knead again.  Separate into tennis ball sized chunks, and drop in simmering broth for 60-90 minutes.

Later, I'll cook the seitan in a saute, broiled, grated and formed into a patty, or sliced thin and seasoned like sandwich meat.

I've had some people comment that it seems a little bit rubbery, but I personally don't find it more rubbery than store-bought seitan.  However, I do tend to have much larger chunks than you get in store bought seitan, which I think would increase that sensation.

I also have had seitan at a gourmet restaurant, Horizons, which has now been replaced by Vedge, both in Philadelphia.  The chefs there are able to make their seitan unbelievably meaty.

Vegetarian chinese restaurants also use seitan based products that are very soft and meat-like.  They almost seems stringy like real meat too.

So, do any of you have suggestions on how I can soften up my seitan?  Is it possible that physically doing something to it would soften it up?  I'm imagining tenderizing it with a mallet or massaging it.  What about a marinade?  Would soaking it in vinegar or some other acid help?  Smaller chunks in the initial simmering?  Shorter/longer simmer time?  Other ingredients in the initial recipe?  Is there some way to make the texture less homogeneous?

I'm no chef, so I'm just speculating at possible ways to improve this. It's very difficult to find good information online, I think because A) vegetarian food and B) the store bought variety is high priced enough that people don't experiment very much.  There are a lot of recipes out there for boiling/simmering, and others for baking.  I've found the baking recipes to be specific imitations of meat loafs, pork chops, etc.  I like the boiling method because it creates a versatile product that can be used similarly to a common cut of meat (chicken breast,  steak).

EDIT: a couple of you have offered excellent, specific recipes, but that's not exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm really looking for techniques to alter basic seitan and change it, hopefully with a little bit of science understanding of what changes the texture of seitan.  Or, am I crazy and there's really only two textures, simmered and baked?  For instance, in my baking experiments, I've created loaves that are much denser than others (to my displeasure), but I wasn't sure what ingredient I used would cause that.  Too much oil, too little oil?  Or perhaps it was the sugar that did that?

[Ox Roast](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ox%20roast).  It's not made from ox.  It is roast beef, sliced, and then braised in au jus till fall-aparty.  And, apparently, the version sold in Erie PA is a little different than Italian Beef as sold in Chicago or roast beef on weck sold in Buffalo.

Does anyone know how to make the au jus the way that it made in Erie PA?

Here's what I know:

* It congeals when cold, so it has gelatin in it.  Probably 'natural' from the beef being roasted, as opposed to gelatin sheets being added.
* It has a heavy onion or other allium flavor.
* Smith's is, at least to my wife, the canonical vendor of ox roast.  [The use a spice combination that I haven't been able to identify](http://www.smithhotdogs.com/customer_service/faqs/) I've only had it twice, and while my attempts to replicate it have tasted good, as determined by my wife, they are way off.

As it is, I've just been making onion broth and mixing it with the pan drippings.  This has been good, but not perfect.

Any insight greatly appreciated.

Non-cullinary background, if you care: My wife, raised in Erie, has had 2 shitty weeks.  Last week, I worked a bunch of overtime so that I could take Friday off.  She wrangled to kids and packed our family to go camping.  We get to the campsite Friday afternoon, and shortly have to evacuate because of the weather.  We get home, and the shit has hit the fan.  Trees and power lines down everywhere, a sinkhole on main street, flash flooding, the works.  We go without power for four days.  The brakes on my truck go out, so we are down to her vehicle.  Monday comes, and I'm back to working overtime, so she has to take me to and from work at times that interfere with nap / sleep times for the kids.  Through this whole thing, she's a trooper.  Life is shit, and she doesn't complain once, because what's complaining going to do other than make me feel guilty for working overtime.

So, to say thanks, I'm going to try to make ox roast the “right” way.  I make a good Italian beef with smoked beef, and she likes it a lot, but its not what she grew up with.

- Sear meat (chicken, pork, steak, etc.), then remove it from the pan and let it finish indirectly.

- Add minced smelly stuff to pan (garlic, shallots, etc.) and cook until fragrant. 

- Add stock to pan (1/2 cup - 3/4 cup), and scrape up bits of meat stuck to the bottom of the pan.  

- Add other liquids (wine, lemon juice, etc.).  Allow time to reduce.  

- Add herbs (rosemary, parsley, etc.).  If using, stir in some chilled butter or olive oil.  

I have 3 questions about this process: 

1)  Am I doing this correctly?  I am a total novice, and I have sort of cobbled together this procedure from several different recipes.  I like experimenting with ingredients though, and I like the structure that making a pan sauce provides for playing with ingredients.  Any tips on my procedure would be greatly appreciated.

2) Sometimes my sauces come out a little thin even after letting it reduce quite a bit.  Is there something I can add to the sauce at the end or the beginning to thicken it up so it will cling to the meat more?  

3) What do I do with the minced stuff in the sauce?  Should I leave all the minced garlic, shallot, etc. in the sauce and ladle that onto the meat with the sauce?  It looks kind of unappetizing, and I've never seen a sauce in a restaurant that had this stuff in it.  Should I strain it out before adding herbs?  What do professional chefs do?

So at my current place we are currently making a peach glaze. I have been making it recently, or at least adjusting it. It is pretty simple. Just cook down some peaches slightly in sugar, water, salt and some Aleppo pepper. Blend that with some raw peaches for some freshness and adjust salt/sugar/viscosity.

Today at work, a batch maybe 2 days old has started to what I think is ferment. At first I thought it was just air bubbles, but after hours of it setting, the bubbles only get more prominent. So I came to the conclusion that is must be fermenting, and those bubbles are not air, but co2. Upon tasting, it has a yeasty undertone.

Now I know I got the peach glaze hot enough to kill any wild yeast on the peaches.

Basically I am wondering what could have caused this, as I find it quite strange. We do bake a lot of bread, mainly brioche and chiabatta atm, and we do get a lot of produce in. My thinking is that there was some wild ambient yeast that landed in my glaze and started to ferment. This just seems unlikely though. Any thoughts? Does dead yeast reactivate under correct conditions, or did wild yeast in the air contaminate the glaze after cooking? Or am I totally wrong and there is no fermentation going on, and the bubbles are for some other reason?

My results have been very inconsistent. I always use the same ingredients, but I vary the time and heat quite a bit so I'm wondering what is the best amount of time and heat, and ingredients, to get that perfect, brown, delicious stock.

My typical process:
(1) 1 chicken carcass
(2) one yellow onion
(3) coarse chopped carrot and celery to match the amount of onion (1:2 ratio)
(4) Fill the pot to cover all ingredients with water
(5) Bring to a rolling boil
(6) Reduce to light simmer
(7) Simmer at least 3 hours, though most of the time I simmer overnight at lowest stove setting.

Any helpful advice?

Edit: Formatting
Edit #2: Wow, thanks for all the great responses! I've gleaned a lot of good info from all these posts, some of it pretty contradictory, but I think I've pinpointed some of my problems. I think I've been boiling the water too much/for too long, and not doing a good enough job of skimming off the fat as it simmers. I also like the idea of adding the veggies later; I have had problems with the veggies just turning to mush and clouding up the final product.

I typically do use a bouquet of herbs (bay leaf, rosemary, peppercorns, etc.) I just didn't add that to my original recipe because it varies a lot with each batch, and I was looking more for advice on how to get the right color/clarity.

I was on vacation with my family near Zion National Park in Utah, and we had dinner at a little place called the Whiptail Grill. The owner and sole employee sold amazing, creative, gourmet southwest-inspired dishes- tacos, burritos, salads, etc. For dessert, he prepared a habanero and peanut butter Crème Brûlée that was one of the best things any of us had ever tasted. 

He informed us the recipe would soon be available in a cookbook he was preparing. Unfortunately, he passed away suddenly in the next few months, and I have spent almost a year trying to find some way to recreate that dish.

It was very smooth, with just enough habanero to give that floral-y flavor with a slight hint of kick, framing the salty/sweet peanut butter perfectly. So my question for anyone willing to provide some input is, what would be the best way to put this thing together? Should I try infusing habaneros with cream, using an extract, or something else entirely?

Obviously it had bones n' parts in it but most of the recipes mention adding veggies and herbs and whatnot. So I added carrots, onions, celery, and a bay leaf and a pinch of thyme with an hour to go like a recipe said.

But since my fledgling cooking repertoire doesn't yet include much that calls for stock, I just went ahead ahead and made soup out of it since lots of soup recipes call for stock. But the soup recipe also called for carrots, onions, celery, and a bay leaf and a pinch of thyme. It seemed kind of silly and wasteful to chop up a bunch of the same stuff and in one case, simmer it for an hour and then toss that stuff out with the bones, and in the other case to simmer the same stuff for a while but keep it in there and eat it. 

I know stock doesn't have to be used for soup and so the veg/herb flavoring would help make a more flavorful stock for other applications, but in a case like I describe above, is it pointless and wasteful to add that stuff to the stock when it will also be in the soup? I have read that some chefs say only bones/carcasses go in stock and that any other flavors are added separately to whatever you make with the stock, but those guys seemed to be in the minority.
