Many people still have not heard about this debate, as it is not being broadcast by the mainstream media. Since we have been covering all of the other debates, I believe we have an obligation to cover this one as well.

It will occur tonight at 9PM EST. Moderated by Larry King. It is taking place at the Hilton Chicago and it is sponsored by the Free and Equal Elections Foundation. 

You will be able to stream it online at the following websites.

The confirmed candidates are  

- Gary Johnson / *Libertarian Party*  
- Jill Stein / *Green Party*  
- Virgil Goode / *Constitution Party*  
- Rocky Anderson / *Justice Party* 

This has not been too publicized. There may be low participation, or no participation at all. But I hope that isn't the case.

Is it true? 

""...two policies that bear primary blame (for the downturn in th economy that is about to occur) are ObamaCare and the fiscal cliff. Markets and business owners are struggling to prepare for these two gut punches. With the fiscal cliff, of course, higher taxes could have a crippling effect, particularly small businesses' ability to hire or expand. But ObamaCare is doing much the same thing in a way that will only worsen as tentacles of regulation extend ever further.

There are many more MANDATES in the law besides the infamous individual mandate to buy health insurance. For example, businesses of 50 or more employees face the crushing burden of providing full, (approved) benefits to employees that work more than 30 hours -- considered ""full-time"" employees per the decree of the new law -- or fines of $2,000 per employee if they don't comply. The response is entirely predictable: Businesses avoid hiring that 50th employee and reduce hours for their current employees or pay the penalty, which is often cheaper than insurance, leaving employees on government exchanges.

Darden Restaurants, the chain that owns Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Longhorn Steakhouse and others, falls into the latter category. The chain announced in October that it would begin limiting employee hours. McDonald's, White Castle and Denny's, among others, are expected to do likewise... John Schnatter, CEO of Papa John's, estimates that ObamaCare will cost the company between $5 million to $8 million annually, translating to reduced employee hours and of course higher prices.

all growth oriented businesses are between the proverbial rock and a hard place. ObamaCare will cost them a fortune, but cutting employee hours and benefits and raising prices to account for it leaves them serving as the lightning rod -- by design. Businesses skirting the law by restructuring their workforce will face retribution from the White House. Washington DC, employment law attorney Robert B. Fitzpatrick said as much when he noted that if businesses are ""just playing with the numbers to avoid compliance... there are going to be consequences.""",Mostly True,False,self,t5_2uvnw,False,MostlyTrue,,True,t3_13b1z0,http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/13b1z0/does_obama_care_require_businesses_of_50/,

My motivation for posting this question is so that I am better able to respond, with accurate facts and statistics, to the charges from people who bash teachers and teacher unions who cite the performance of Massachusetts schools under Romney's time as governor as proof that he 'fixed' things with his policy ideas.

He talks a great deal about demonizing teacher unions and saying that vouchers are the answer to under performing schools when it is apparent that it is just a roundabout way to slowly erode the unions. However, I'm not looking for ~~un~~biased, partisan facts that aim just to discredit him without merit.

accurate viewpoint on the issue.

http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/zcrmz/can_we_get_confirmed_unsolved_disproved_tags_for/

The improved posting of text posts to encourage better formatted questions and posts to fact check wasn't our idea. That came from here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/zazcj/meta_would_making_this_sub_self_posts_only_help/

I have no doubt now, that more good ideas are to come, and we welcome them all. 

What's next? We still have to really implement the Flair to each post, we still need to suss through more policy things. We need to make everything clearer and simpler. And then we need to do some design to really polish the User Experience and User Interface here. A lot. If you want to help on any front let any of us mods know. And of course, post great, meaningful questions for us to check, and help us reaserch the ones others have.

Oh, and lastly, help us get the word out. Any ideas on how to continue to grow this Community and to bring in all ideological and political communities we can are welcome. The more varied the Community, the more eyes, the more research, the better this gets.  

Wrapping up this update with this message we got yesterday that came to the mods:

&gt;Just wanted to thank you for creating an awesome community. I hope it stays just as pure of intentioned and practices for years to come and changes the political discussion on reddit and irl. Although I had strong feelings for truth in politics before, you have written them down and how they should be realized in a concise easy to follow format. Once again, thank you, and Good luck!

More to come, 

Tim

1346959880.0,26,self.politicalfactchecking,zgq76,A few reminders to our new community,dirtyfries,30,4,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/zgq76/a_few_reminders_to_our_new_community/,"Hello everyone! To start with, I'd like to thank the new community that has been built here. We're seeing some amazing questions, excellent discussion, and downright civil interactions I wasn't sure could exist in a political subreddit.

That said, a few housekeeping items to remind everyone about.

**This subreddit is organic and new.** There may be methods or policies you aren't a fan of or that don't quite work yet. If there's something you'd like to see improved or changed, please don't hesitate to ask. Myself and the other mods want the integrity of this subreddit to be above everything else.

**Second**, when it comes to assigning a final rating to a post, I want to remind you all that the rating is reflective of that mod's best ability to be objective. It is not a set-in-stone rating that trumps discussion. If you disagree with a rating, remember that ratings should not be used as evidence in a political discussion. The real value of these posts is the evidence presented by the community in the threads falling under the initial post. **The final rating only acts as a guide**, but it is you, the reader, who should take the evidence and make a decision based on your own logic and reasoning. We as moderators will attempt to simply justify our rating selection, but please don't turn it into an argument. The rubric we use is in the sidebar for reference. ---&gt;

**Third**, please remember this is not /r/politics. This is a fact-finding subreddit. We are not here to debate policies or beliefs, but to discuss the immediate validity of a posted statement. Pretty much every post in a discussion should be a fact-based reference complete with citations or explanation of data. **We will not tolerate opinion debates** and they will be deleted accordingly. If they continue, warnings will be issued and if those are ignored, bans given. For this subreddit to function, we need to leave our feelings at the door and look at solid sources.

Thank you again to all of you. from what I'm seeing this is going to be a useful source for culling factual information together. Based on these posts, people will be able to make better-informed decisions and to share it with others.

The assumption is that the number of cloture motions proves the use of the filibuster, but there's reason to believe otherwise.

http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304707604577424491399594250.html

&gt; So Republicans are to blame for all those cloture petitions to end filibusters, right? Wrong. The fact that the majority has filed so many cloture petitions is as much a symptom of its own efforts to block the Senate from working its will as anything the minority has done. Consider this example.

&gt; On March 19, Robert Menendez (D., N.J.) introduced legislation (S. 2204) to promote renewable energy with the cost offset by a tax hike on large oil producers. The normal process would have been for this legislation to be referred to committee for action.

&gt; Majority Leader Harry Reid bypassed the committee process, however, and using something called Rule 14 had the bill placed directly on the Senate calendar. Two days later, he started the process to call up the bill by moving to ""proceed to it"" and immediately filed a cloture petition to end debate on that motion.

&gt; The following Monday, the Senate then voted 92-4 to curtail debate on the motion to proceed to the bill. The next day, as soon as the bill was before the Senate, Mr. Reid offered five consecutive amendments and one motion in order to effectively block the consideration of any competing amendments or motions.

&gt; He then filed a cloture motion to close out debate on the bill. Two days later, the Senate rejected cloture on a party-line vote and moved on to other business, leaving the Menendez bill adrift.

&gt; Now go back to the Politico story and ask yourself how exactly Republicans filibustered this bill? They didn't have time to filibuster anything, it was over so quickly. Moreover, their ability to take meaningful action was effectively nullified by four specific parliamentary maneuvers taken by Mr. Reid.

This photo is often used to claim that the filibuster is being used often:

Do help us get the word out about our role here real-time fact checking the final two debates (and everything in between and after). As with the last two we will set up a dedicated thread for the debate, and we'll promote out of that thread the fact-claims/comments that get the most votes up.

I am asking you to fact check *me*.

I have long believed, and often argued, that the poor are far more likely to invest money they get back into the economy. Because they are poor, any additional money they get is money they will likely *need* to spend on goods and services. On the other hand, someone who is rich is more likely to let any tax cut sit in a bank account somewhere, or some hedge fund, where its benefit to the economy is minimal by comparison. Additionally, if a rich person *does* spend that money, they are more likely to spend it overseas, where it isn't going to do the American economy much good.

To me, this seems self-evident, but I have never really had factual data to back it up, and I know that there are many who believe otherwise. So... can you fact-checkers prove me right or wrong? I'd appreciate any solid information you could provide on this topic.

*from [ABC's transcript](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/transcript-president-obamas-democratic-convention-speech/story?id=17175575#.UEl3O41lTYg), which contains a few minor errors (e.g. it says ""the next founder of Google"" instead of ""the next Steve Jobs"", I thought this was quite humorous)*

&gt;I've met workers in Detroit and Toledo who feared they'd never build another American car. Today, they can't build them fast enough, because we reinvented a dying auto industry that's back on top of the world.

----

&gt;I've signed trade agreements that are helping our companies sell more goods to millions of new customers – goods that are stamped with three proud words: Made in America.

----
&gt;After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years. And now you have a choice: we can give more tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, or we can start rewarding companies that open new plants and train new workers and create new jobs here, in the United States of America. We can help big factories and small businesses double their exports, and if we choose this path, we can create a million new manufacturing jobs in the next four years

----
&gt;After thirty years of inaction, we raised fuel standards so that by the middle of the next decade, cars and trucks will go twice as far on a gallon of gas. We've doubled our use of renewable energy, and thousands of Americans have jobs today building wind turbines and long-lasting batteries. In the last year alone, we cut oil imports by one million barrels a day – more than any administration in recent history. And today, the United States of America is less dependent on foreign oil than at any time in nearly two decades.

----
&gt;But unlike my opponent, I will not let oil companies write this country's energy plan, or endanger our coastlines, or collect another $4 billion in corporate welfare from our taxpayers.

----
&gt;If you choose this path, we can cut our oil imports in half by 2020 and support more than 600,000 new jobs in natural gas alone.


----
&gt;For the first time in a generation, nearly every state has answered our call to raise their standards for teaching and learning. Some of the worst schools in the country have made real gains in math and reading. Millions of students are paying less for college today because we finally took on a system that wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on banks and lenders.


----
&gt;Around the world, we've strengthened old alliances and forged new coalitions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. We've reasserted our power across the Pacific and stood up to China on behalf of our workers. From Burma to Libya to South Sudan, we have advanced the rights and dignity of all human beings – men and women; Christians and Muslims and Jews.

----
&gt;Independent analysis shows that my plan would cut our deficits by $4 trillion. Last summer, I worked with Republicans in Congress to cut $1 billion spending


----
&gt;I want to reform the tax code so that it's simple, fair, and asks the wealthiest households to pay higher taxes on incomes over $250,000 – the same rate we had when Bill Clinton was president; the same rate we had when our economy created nearly 23 million new jobs, the biggest surplus in history, and a lot of millionaires to boot.

(I may have replaced a with the, and so on. I also went with the statement they were intending to make, in cases where they corrected themselves) 


**Warren**: In the short run we also have work that needs to be done and people who need those jobs. So my view is we should put them to work. That is why I was so surprised when Senator Brown last fall voted against three jobs bills in a row. Jobs bills that supported 22,000 jobs here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Jobs bills that would have prevented the layoffs of teachers, firefighters, and police officers all across the Commonwealth. A jobs bills that would have supported 11k jobs mostly in construction here in Massachusetts, which has been particularly hard hit.

**Brown**: Thank you John, appreciate the question. As you know I've been down there working on jobs. The three jobs bills that she refers to, with all due respect. Would have raised your taxes $450 Billion dollars. It was a bipartisan rejection. Political votes put up just to score points, so you could talk about it today.

* And obviously now are up to amost 5,000 subscribers/readers/factcheckers here...

The group can then VOTE UP or DOWN any comment/factcheck claim based on the merit you see in it. We'll look at the top comments and then pull from those to create stand alone fact check threads from them, and fact checking can occur there as it does normally.

Likewise, is there any good way to determine that a source unquestionably *is*, and on a regular enough basis that that source can be deemed untrustworthy?

Clearly, some sources are beyond reproach - the content of a bill can be confirmed or denied by simply looking at the bill itself, and whether someone said something can often be made undeniably clear by video footage of them saying it.

somehow displayed (never looked into if it is possible, just assuming it is).

Please discuss and add to / remove as you feel appropriate. The close we get to debates / elections the harder it will be to actually fact check all of the questions coming in. There is no point fact checking something that while they may have a good question, the way they worded it makes it unverifiable.

Mods, sorry if I am stepping on toes or asked the meta question in the wrong way :) If I did just let me know.


Section: What is verifiable

Not every question can be verified for a number of reason. Please form all questions in a way that can be answered by a Yes/No answer. For example:

Good Questions: 

* Person X said that he created 5,000 jobs in the US during 2010, is this true?
* Company Y said ""Person X has increased the spending of the government by $5,000 per person living in the US since 2008"", is this true?

Bad Questions:

* Person X said that he created jobs, how many did he create?
* Company Y said ""Person X spends more than anyone else in history"" Thoughts?
* Is it possible that person X spent more than 5 million on funding?

When posting a question try and keep it so that there is only a single fact to be checked. Asking for an ad to be checked that has 10 questions means that it cannot be answered Yes/No, you have to check 10 different questions and 5 may be true and 5 may be false. A better way to do this is to submit 10 different posts, 1 for each fact.

The state of mind for a person or a company cannot be checked. There is no way for us to know if Company X intentionally misreported something. However we can check if they did misreport something. For example:

Good Question: News station X stated that Person Y created 5million jobs over the 2009 and 2010 calendar years, is this true?

Bad Question: Did News station X purposefully state that Person Y created 5million jobs in 2009/2010 when he actually created 10million jobs?

The question you ask should make sure to include enough details that you are not misquoting an article. If the question is really long due to a very specific figure being quoted, put the subject in the title such as ""Does statue X do Y [Details Inside]"". Then you can place the full question in the text part of the post. The reason is that a lot of times a headline is a few words to grab attention. If you read the article the real question may be ""Does statue X do Y when you live in state Z and are under the age of 18 and are not emancipated."" Where this is very brief, the question may really take up 4 or 5 sentences.

When asking a question please give a source (or many if you have them) regarding the question.

Is this criticism accurate?,,15,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/11e5rh/washington_post_claims_heritage_study_on_romney/,"As I'm sure you're all aware, the Tax Policy Center published a study claiming Romney's tax plan is impossible. Heritage published [a study](http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/09/tax-policy-centers-skewed-analysis-of-governor-romneys-tax-plan#_ftn9) soon thereafter, written by Curtis Dubay, claiming that the TPC was wrong. Among other things, Dubay cited the elimination of [stepped-up basis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepped-up_basis) as a source of possible savings. Dubay referenced [this CBO study](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/spec.pdf) (large PDF, pages 261, 272) for his cost savings estimates.

The Washington Post published [a critique of the Heritage study](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/26/how-to-make-mitt-romneys-tax-plan-add-up-sort-of/) claiming that the stepped-up basis estimate was incorrect.

&gt;The $19 billion figure is how less the current system takes in than if all assets were taxed at capital gains rates at death. That’s a much more dramatic change than the one Dubay is proposing, so Dubay’s change will likely bring in “much less revenue than implied by the tax expenditure estimate,” Looney says.

I think this criticism is incorrect and would like to know what others think. Here's what Dubay's study says about eliminating the stepped-up basis rule:

&gt;Plans that properly repeal the death tax typically employ a system, after repeal, whereby heirs pay capital gains tax when they sell inherited assets using as the basis the price paid by the person from whom they inherited the asset. This is called “carry-over” basis.

The CBO figure he cites is comparing the current stepped-up basis system to the following:

&gt;Under the baseline tax system, unrealized capital gains 
would be taxed when assets are transferred at death or 
by gift.

The only difference I can see between Dubay's proposal and the CBO analysis is that appreciation on property passed at death would not be taxed until the heir sells the property. Imagine I buy property for $10, its worth $20 at my death, and my heir sells it for $30 ten years after my death. Under Dubay's proposal, my heir pays capital gains tax on $20 ten years after my death. Under the CBO analysis, my estate pays capital gains tax on $10 at my death and my heir pays $10 in capital gains when he sells. This would mean slightly less revenue because of time value of money considerations, but I don't think it would be ""much less"" and I don't think these two scenarios are ""dramatically different.""

Are there other factors that I'm missing? Do you think the CBO baseline and the carry-over basis Dubay proposes are substantially different such that using the CBO figures makes Dubay's study wrong?",Please Verify,False,self,t5_2uvnw,False,Verify,,True,t3_11e5rh,http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/11e5rh/washington_post_claims_heritage_study_on_romney/,

Some suggest that you can't tax anyone above 20%, because they'll simply find a way to avoid taxes above that magic number. One source often cited is the Laffer Curve:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laffer_curve

Obviously this calls into question the current US income rates above $35k in the US, although arguably if you also consider Payroll taxes, any American making over $8700/yr is paying a combined income tax of at least ~25%. It appears there should be ample proof that this magic 20% number is simply untrue. But - is it?

Since tax percentages can be complicated, let's define the rate in question as the Effective Income Tax Rate - what each individual pays in total to the government, over their income, annually.

They give 5 reasons why Obama should be impeached:

&gt;1. Illegally Going to War, Supporting Regime Change, and Provoking Russia and China into broader, potentially Thermonuclear Conflict

&gt;2. Illegally ordering the Assassination of American Citizens without due Process


&gt;3. Continuing/Escalating Bush-Cheney's Police State Measures &amp; Other Dictatorship Measures

“The middle 20 percent of all American taxpayers has paid an average effective tax rate of 3 percent to 9 percent since 1990, according to the Tax Policy Center, while the top 1 percent's average rate ranged from 18 percent to 24 percent over that period.”

That didn’t sound right to me so I went here: http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=456. 

The effective tax rates reported are nowhere near where Fox News reports the Tax Policy Center. What is reported as the middle quintile is closer to the bottom quintile. And what is reported as the top 1% tax rate is closer to the middle 20%. Am I looking at the incorrect numbers?

Line by line:

*  Credit rating - AAA to AA, well, I fail to see how that is Obama's ""fault"" the banks did that to themselves and in proxy effects the rest of the world. My *opinion* on this is that the piss poor job the banks did handing out loans and fleecing the public contributed to this.  I could be totally wrong about this.  

* I have not done the maths yet, but here is the [US Gov unemployment chart](http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet) .  You will have to manually change the year range, but you can see that unemployment rate skyrocketed right after the recession took a dive.  [This image may work...](http://data.bls.gov/generated_files/graphics/latest_numbers_LNS14000000_2000_2012_all_period_M08_data.gif)
Again, to think that the day Obama stepped into the White House as President this all happened HAS to be because of external forces not directly related to him taking office.  Looking at the recovery period starting at the end of 2009 (almost 2 years of unemployment rate going up), there as been a steady decline, which is good, but not great.

*  I really don't remember gas being that cheap in a while, but a [quick search does reveal](http://www.GasBuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx?city1=USA Average&amp;city2=&amp;city3=&amp;crude=n&amp;tme=96&amp;units=us) that in fact it was that low.  I do not really see the correlation between who was President and gas prices.  I thought gas prices were determined by oil speculators that ""guess"" how much a barrel of oil should cost and [basic supply and demand](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/gas-prices.asp#axzz26mCUWzVP) metrics.  I also think that the BP oil spill has something to do with rising gas prices during and after the disaster - supply low + demand high = higher gas prices?

* ""National Debt"" is a broad term to me.  There are my types of government debt and metrics that go with it.  IIRC, under Clinton, we had a surplus and under GW Bush, that got turned around into a debt.  [This chart](http://www.usfederalbudget.us/spending_chart_1996_2012USr_13s1li111lcn_G0f) illustrates the *Federal Deficit*, which I think is a more accurate metric.  I don't think *public debt* which I think the FB image depicts is an accurate representation of ""debt"" illustrated [here](http://www.usfederalbudget.us/spending_chart_1996_2012USr_13s1li111lcn_H0f).

*  I do not have any real knowledge on the National budget and cannot really comment on this.  I do know that there was a 1000+ day period where NO budget was passed.  The proposal from Obama was downvoted 97-0, meaning that NO ONE approved it.  Republican Paul Ryan, his bill was also voted against and lost.  I do understand that pushing a budgt through is the same as planning spending money at home whether to buy groceries or a car.  That's like me handing my wife a budget for the month that allows me to buy 5 TV's, but no groceries... I'll be getting my nuts kicked in.  Either way, whether this is Obama's fault or the Senates fault (I find both equally as guilty), no one there seems to be able to get their heads out of their asses to make a non-partisan agreement to make a budget. 
 
*  This is just a blatant lie all around... Going back to the first bullet point, it does not take a genius to know that both sides of the [comparison is just plain wrong](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000).

Link: http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2013/07/17/10-Facts-the-media-Arent-telling-you-about-the-zimmerman-case

Text: 1. There is Zero Evidence Race was Involved In the Shooting
Early last year, as the tragic and fatal shooting of teenager Trayvon Martin was just starting to bubble up, the media falsely described George Zimmerman as ""white."" The name Zimmerman apparently fooled the media into believing they had a white versus black narrative on their hands. Once they learned Zimmerman was Hispanic, rather than change course, in order to cover up their mistake, the media put the pedal to the metal in pushing a racial angle.
This crusade, however, is anti-science. A thorough federal investigation into Zimmerman found absolutely no evidence that there was any racism in his past or in his motivations the night of the shooting.
During the trial, the prosecution did not accuse Zimmerman of having any kind of racial motive.
The one juror who has spoken out said the jury saw no evidence of a racial motivation.
The media's racial narrative is based on nothing more than partisan lies, speculation, innuendo, and a cynical alchemy conjured from nothing to enflame division and hate.
Moreover, it is reasonable to assume the media have been swarming Zimmerman's life looking for anything that might point to racism. But as of yet there have been no media reports (that weren't later debunked and retracted) reporting Zimmerman has been found to be a closet racist.
On the contrary…
 
2. Zimmerman's Admirable History of Being Colorblind Toward Blacks
Zimmerman's past indicates he is color blind. He has dated black women, tutored black children, once stood up for a black homeless man against the police (we're told he so desperately wants to impress), has black relatives, and voted for the first black president.
 
3. Zimmerman is Hispanic, Not White
Like President Obama, Zimmerman has one white parent. Quite properly, the media have never referred to Obama as ""half-black,"" a ""self-described black,"" or a ""white black."" Obama is black. Period.
Zimmerman, however, has been stripped of his Hispanic racial identity across almost every media outlet in America. Though he is as Hispanic as Obama is black, because it is inconvenient to the white versus black racial narrative the media are hyping, the media refuse to identify Zimmerman as a Hispanic.
A full fifteen months after the media learned they had made a mistake and that their prey was Hispanic, some in media are still referring to Zimmerman as ""white.""
Those not referring to him as white are either ignoring his racial heritage altogether, or describing him as a ""white Hispanic"" or some variation of a ""self-described Hispanic.""
As far as I know, this is an unprecedented editorial decision.
Speaking of unprecedented…
 
4. Obama's Justice Department Has Launched a National Fishing Expedition Against Zimmerman
Probably because the reporting of such a frightening and Orwellian act of federal overreach might make look Zimmerman look sympathetic and hurt Obama, the media have apparently decided to ignore Attorney General Eric Holder's public witch hunt. The Justice Department is setting up a public tip line for Americans to ""help build a case against Zimmerman.""
In order to build a civil rights case, the government needs evidence of racism.
The federal government crowd-sourcing for evidence against a single American is both chilling and something heretofore unheard of.  
 
5. Like Some Conservatives, President Obama Feared Violence After the Verdict
One of the false racially-charged talking points some in media are using against conservatives is that we are racist for fearing there might be violence in the wake of the verdict.
Something inconvenient to that narrative is the fact that a black, leftist American president beloved by the media also feared there would be violence in the wake of the verdict. After the verdict was announced, the president released a statement that said in part:
I know this case has elicited strong passions.  And in the wake of the verdict, I know those passions may be running even higher.  But we are a nation of laws, and a jury has spoken.  I now ask every American to respect the call for calm reflection from two parents who lost their young son.
Unfortunately for a race-baiting media, this, one of the president's better moments, has to be ignored in order to serve an artificial narrative.
Which brings me to number six…
 
6. There Has Been Widespread Violence After the Verdict
The fear President Obama and those ""racist"" conservatives shared about the possibility of violence in the wake of the Zimmerman verdict has been vindicated.  
In just a few days, Breitbart News has documented over two dozen separate acts of violence and lawlessness throughout the country.
The media are dutifully covering up this widespread violence. Yes, they report on each separate act, but always with a ""mostly peaceful"" qualifier. The media also refuse to connect the dots and widen their reportorial context to show the entire picture.
One aspect of this lawless spree the racially-obsessed media adamantly refuse to report on are the reported ""hate crimes"" being committed by black against whites and Hispanics.
Which brings me to…
 
7. Zimmerman Protesters Commit Numerous Racially-Motivated Assaults:
While the irresponsible media is inventing from whole cloth a racial narrative in the Trayvon shooting, at the same time, they are willfully ignoring actual racially-motivated assaults occurring in the wake of the verdict.
Thus far, there have been three reported hate crimes -- actual assaults -- committed by Trayvon supporters. But like the awful murders taking hundreds of black lives in Chicago, the media refuse to call national attention to these verdict-inspired hate crimes because there is no political upside in doing so. How can a liberal media call attention to the violence in Chicago when liberals and liberalism are the problem?  
The same thinking holds true for these reported assaults by blacks against Hispanics and whites. To focus on reality might undermine the fabricated narrative that an innocent black teenager was stalked and murdered by a racist white man.
 
8. ""Stand Your Ground"" Has Nothing to do With the Zimmerman Case
Other than ginning up black turnout for Obama's re-election effort in the crucial swing state of Florida and enflaming racial tensions (which solidifies the Democrat base), another partisan goal the media hopes to achieve from the Zimmerman case is to toxify the ""Stand Your Ground"" laws that currently exist in 30 states.
But like the fact that Zimmerman is not white and that there is zero evidence showing race was in any way involved in his actions the night of the shooting, the media have also bumped into another inconvenient reality: ""Stand Your Ground"" had nothing to do with Zimmerman's defense or acquittal.
The Zimmerman case was a simple case of self-defense:
The jury received standard instructions. Zimmerman did not invoke the Stand Your Ground provision. Zimmerman later waived his right to a pretrial immunity hearing under the Stand Your Ground procedures.
And as National Review’s Sterling Beard points out, “The only time Stand Your Ground came up during the trial proper was when a prosecution witness stated that he’d taught a class Zimmerman had attended that covered Stand Your Ground.”
Even the prosecution rejects the cynical attempt to tie Martin’s death to Stand Your Ground. Prosecutor John Guy couldn’t have made it clearer during the trial: “This case is not about standing your ground.” During their post-trial press conference, as conservative talk show host Victoria Taft first noted, a Miami Herald reporter asked the prosecution team specifically whether Stand Your Ground “affected the facts in this case and whether this case could have been won, perhaps, pre the changes in the law.”
Prosecutor Bernie De La Rionda replied: “You know, self-defense has existed for a long time. And we’ve dealt with it in Jackson for a long time.
These facts, though, have failed to stop Eric Holder or the media from pretending the complete opposite is true.
 
9. Rachel Jeantel Might Be Responsible for the Deadly Confrontation
An unfortunate mix of marijuana, homophobia, and a friend whispering warnings in your ear at night, could go a long towards explaining why a physical altercation occurred:
[CNN's PIERS] MORGAN: And he was freaked out by it [Zimmerman following him]?
JEANTEL: Yes. Definitely after I say may be a rapist, for every boy, for every man, every -- who's not that kind of way, seeing a grown man following them, would they be creep out?
She continued:
""And people need to understand, he didn't want that creepy ass cracker going to his father or girlfriend's house to go get -- mind you, his little brother was there. You know -- now, mind you, I told you -- I told Trayvon it might have been a rapist.""
Evidence that shows why Trayvon might have been the aggressor, though, is inconvenient to a media desperate to enflame racial tensions. Moreover, bringing the issue of homophobia into the personal narratives of Trayvon and Jeantel just can't be allowed to happen.
This bombshell has been swept under the rug just as effectively as the other nine.
 
10. The Florida Justice System's Leniency Towards Trayvon Led to His Death
In order to make his crime statistics look good, Police Chief Charles Hurley of the Miami-Dade School Police Department is suspected of juicing the numbers by treating outright crimes as simple disciplinary problems. As Robert Stacy McCain reports in the American Spectator, Trayvon Martin ended up being a victim of this practice.
Instead of being arrested and charged after being found with a burglary tool and 13 pieces of jewelry stolen from a house a half-mile from the school, Trayvon was suspended from school. Trayvon was also caught with marijuana:
Either of those incidents could have put Trayvon Martin into the custody of the juvenile justice system. However, because of Chief Hurley’s attempt to reduce the school crime statistics — according to sworn testimony, officers were “basically told to lie and falsify” reports — Martin was never arrested. And if he had been arrested, he might never have been in Sanford the night of his fatal encounter with Zimmerman.
What we have here is a case of police corruption in which the media have shown no interest, even though you can connect the dots to Trayvon's tragic death.
But to report this story would mean upsetting the narrative that Trayvon was an innocent (like many of us at 17, he got in trouble) and that the only cause of his death was a racist white man protected by racist white laws (passed almost unanimously by Republicans and Democrats).
--
While the simple and noble act of reporting the full truth might help to ease tensions, as racial violence breaks out across the country, the media have shown no remorse for enflaming citizens with falsehoods.
Sadly, the media have not even signaled that they might slow down.

A lot of people just want to tell themselves they are making things better by doing something. Whether it actually helps doesn't matter because they just want to make themselves feel all warm and fuzzy with a false sense of security and self-righteousness for helping others. And it's not the thought that counts because they are actually lowering everyone's safety by masking the real problem allowing it to get worse while making people more vulnerable because of their ignorance and false sense of safety. Politicians are great at making bubbles via social engineering and this is no different. You can live in your little dream world and pretend that banning guns is going to make you and the world safer, and it might stop a few accidents and a few suburbia-on-suburbia shootings, but not dealing with the problem of mental health and closely tied poverty will only make the issue of violence worse. Desperate people resort to desperate measures. I think a lot of the people who are against radical gun control have some real justification, not because they think that the loss of even one individual isn't important but that if we are not careful we will end up with a ""war on guns"" much like the ""war on drugs."" And if you don't know anything about drugs or wars the attempt to combine them has been a disaster and in the long run only increased the demand for drugs. It has turned mom and pop meth trailers into high volume meth industries south of the border and ruined the potential of countless people for smoking weed. And yes weed is illegal so they shouldn't smoke it. But that is also ignorance. Getting drunk and driving and alcoholism are far worse threats to society than someone smoking some pot. How many people does that make a hypocrite. The only superficial statistic you can use to justify harsh penalties for marijuana use is that it is a gateway drug and you have to stop the heavy drug users before they start. Well that is another example of self-righteous warm fuzziness, probably by people that drink regularly. If you had to go to the same circle of people to get your glass of wine as you do to get an 8ball it would not be hard to link wine as a gateway to cocaine. 

People need to start dealing with their/our problems instead of deferring the accountability to the state or to a god. And I use “their/our” in a completely individualistic and selfish context. Raising the standard of living as a hole increases the opportunity for an individual to raise their own standard of living.",,False,self,t5_2uvnw,False,,,True,t3_1az509,http://www.reddit.com/r/politicalfactchecking/comments/1az509/i_hate_to_bring_up_something_so_topical_as_gun/,
