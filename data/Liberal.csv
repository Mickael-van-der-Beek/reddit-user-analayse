I started with conservativism because I was raised fairly conservative and am a Christian. I decided to determine where they stand on several key issues. The way I see the current conservative views are as follows: (foriegn affairs) interventionalist, (economic policy) Raegan style top-down economics, (social) racist/sexist/homhobic--and using the Bible to support these views. Well, that didn't cut it for me.

So I went on to look at Libertarians, they support gay rights and are non-interventionalist, right? Well, I was finally able to wrap my mind around the ideas of Libertarianism and they kind of scared the shit out of me. Did you know that they support a system of governance whereby the free-market controls EVERYTHING? Basically, many libertarians are anti-tax, anti-regulation, and believe that the free market and enterprise will be able to effectively regulate itself. Taxes used to build infrastructure are wrong (nay, theft!), taxes used to educate the populace are THEFT!, and taxes used for really anything that government does are theft. This is completely insane.

TL;DR: I now realize that I am a ""crazy Liberal"" because I believe top-down economics doesn't work, because I believe people should have freedom over their bodies, and because I believe that some level of government spending and regulation (schools, infrastructure, etc.) are absolutely necessary to the functioning of a modern economy.

These are a few stories about some of my experiences in high school, as a liberal in one of the most conservative places in America. Please share your horror stories as well: 

I've never had such seemingly friendly people become so right out degrading and hostile towards me as when extreme conservatives find out I'm a liberal. 

High school government class (2008-ish): After my government teacher who, to his credit, was a well-meaning guy, asked if any of us had donated to a campaign I raised my hand and said that I'd given a few dollars to the Obama campaign. The whole class gasped, laughed, screamed ""WHAT!?""  and two students who thought they were particularly funny literally stood up and began yelling things like, ""you dirty liberal!"" or ""commie!"" This kind of behavior was a regular occurrence everyday. They did not get in trouble for their behavior. 

another story: 
one day students in class began saying how ""all gays should be rounded up and fenced in and left to die"" and ""all gays should be murdered"". The teacher didn't say a word. I stayed after class and told the teacher their comments were offensive. He told me it was just immaturity, and after that I think he assumed I was gay, because he never treated me the same. 

last one: 
In speech class nearly ever other speech was a conservative calling card. This was during the rise of the tea party. One student gave an entire speech on how vegetarian liberals (he walked over to my desk and pointed right in my face, laughing) were trying to destroy the country and led the whole class in a chant along the lines of ""Nobama!"" or something like that. The teacher thought that was hilarious.

Also had a french teacher who, rather than teaching French, made us read books like The Naked Communist and lectured us on how evil social security was everyday. 

ONE MORE THING: the only political opinion in the editorial section of the local paper is Bill O'Reilly's opinion column. 

I could go on and on. 


EDIT: forgot to mention the most ironic thing about all this: Rexburg is literally almost entirely built with federal funds. After the Teton Dam flood disaster in the 1970s the federal government rebuilt almost the whole city, taking people on their word when they claimed what buildings and goods they had lost in the flood.

R/Republican and R/Anarco_Capitalism and R/Conservative and R/Libertarian would all just agree with me, but I'm really looking for an answer, and I'm not here antagonistically to debate anything just really open to learning.

The other day I saw on R/Politics that a large majority of Americans support raising the minimum wage to 10.80. I understand the sentiment behind it, but I don't understand how that would solve the problem, and in some cases think it would adversely affect me in a negative way.

I'm by no means rich, I work as a bank teller making about 12.50 an hour. The way I understand it, if the minumum wage were to go up to 10.80, wouldn't the cost of goods and services also go up thereby negating the effect we hoped the raise would make? What good is a raise to 10.80 if the price of mcdonalds goes up? In essence, a raise in the cost of labor would in turn be shifted to the consumer in higher prices. 

Furthermore, things like rent are based on market principles of supply and demand. Wouldn't the cost of rent go up if the market is flooded with more money? 

and after this raise in the minimum wage, there is no guarantee that my job would give me a raise. I make 12.50 an hour... I'd still make above minimum wage but because of the price increases in rent and other things, my 12.50 an hour would have less purchasing power. 

Seriously not trying to troll, if I'm wrong please explain it to me so I may no longer be wrong. Thanks. 

PS. as a republican I'm scared of Hillary Clinton because I love that woman! all my republican friends are just waiting for me to flake out on them if she runs. I'd vote for Hillary

Edit: hey guys, thanks for all the replies. You are making good points. If I challenge any of them it's just for the sake of working this out in my mind, not out of some need to debate!

For those of you who ask why liberals tend to shun libertarians, I would like to hold up this comment thread as the answer.

The add itself is straightforward enough, starting with a teenager taking a shower in filthy water, then biking on unpaved roads and through trash-filled fields, before finally playing soccer in a public park that looks like it hasn't been mowed in months. While definitely hyperbole, it emphasizes the point that without taxes, many things will suffer.

The response was much as you'd expect, containing the fallacy that everyone would magically be willing to pay for everything as soon as the government disappeared. The discussion contained such gems as:

&gt;""This is the exact argument for if slaves became free. They need to be slaves otherwise they will just be lazy. Wow.""

As well as:

&gt;""Is that what you believe, or are you claiming someone else does? I believe toxic people will be toxic no matter what government you have.

And the assumption that government removes all work ethic:

&gt;""The question is one of how powerful a government they will be able to corrupt and use against you. Currently, they wield the world's most powerful military. If there were no state, they would have to do their own dirty work.""

And here we have:

&gt;""Things get done because people want them done. That demand for action does not disappear just because a government isn't coercing money away from people. If people want roads, and fields, and clean water, then--newsflash--they will voluntarily pay for it! It's not hard to understand.

And of course, what would a libertarian feel-good thread be without bringing up Nazism and Stalinism?

&gt;""So, the Swedish tax collectors have a fictitious horror scenario to try to justify their existence. Meanwhile, we can point to the Nazi death camps, the Soviet gulag, the prison camps of the Baby God Dictator of the Norks, and point out that they are all tax-funded.""",,False,self,t5_2qxt5,False,,,True,t3_19ptmf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/19ptmf/circlejerk_on_rlibertarian_shows_they_have_no/,

This deserves national attention.",,104,28,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/tgmhn/today_it_was_revealed_that_mitt_romney_bullied/,"Why?  Because we elect Presidents based not only for their skill sets, but also according to how we feel about them in the office, how they reflect our values and what we think each one will be able to teach younger generations as our country's top role model.  In fact, it can be argued personal character is the *main* reason most Presidents win election.  And character is as evident in our adolescence as it is relevant in the White House.

[Today in the *Washington Post*](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-prep-school-classmates-recall-pranks-but-also-troubling-incidents/2012/05/10/gIQA3WOKFU_story.html?tid=pm_politics_pop), Romney's former prep school classmates - ""who gave their accounts independently of one another"" - recounted his attitude and dealings with a student who was presumed to be gay.

&gt; John Lauber, a soft-spoken new student one year behind Romney, was perpetually teased for his nonconformity and presumed homosexuality. Now he was walking around the all-boys school with bleached-blond hair that draped over one eye, and Romney wasn’t having it.

&gt; “He can’t look like that. That’s wrong. Just look at him!” an incensed Romney told Matthew Friedemann, his close friend in the Stevens Hall dorm, according to Friedemann’s recollection. Mitt, the teenaged son of Michigan Gov. George Romney, kept complaining about Lauber’s look, Friedemann recalled.

&gt; A few days later, Friedemann entered Stevens Hall off the school’s collegiate quad to find **Romney marching out of his own room ahead of a prep school posse shouting about their plan to cut Lauber’s hair.** Friedemann followed them to a nearby room where **they came upon Lauber, tackled him and pinned him to the ground. As Lauber, his eyes filling with tears, screamed for help, Romney repeatedly clipped his hair with a pair of scissors.**

Critics of the article may point out this paragraph:

&gt; The men have differing political affiliations, although they mostly lean Democratic. Buford volunteered for Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008. Seed, a registered independent, has served as a Republican county chairman in Michigan. All of them said that politics in no way colored their recollections.

However, all five of those interviewed are today successful, professional men (a dentist, a lawyer, a retired prosecutor and a retired principal, along with a fifth man who asked to remain anonymous), and as previously noted, spoke of their recollections independently.  Five witnesses, speaking separately, all saying the same thing.

&gt; “It was a hack job,” recalled Maxwell, a childhood friend of Romney who was in the dorm room when the incident occurred. “It was vicious.”

&gt; The incident transpired in a flash, and Friedemann said **Romney then led his cheering schoolmates** back to his bay-windowed room in Stevens Hall. 

&gt; Friedemann, guilt ridden, made a point of not talking about it with his friend and waited to see what form of discipline would befall Romney at the famously strict institution. **Nothing happened.**

This is the guy running for our President.  A coldhearted, homophobic bully.  And he wants to lead our nation.

If character matters in the White House, few revelations (particularly coming on the heels of North Carolina's Amendment One vote and President Obama's coming out in favor gay marriage) can shed more light on who Mitt Romney really is.

I am a Conservative. This is a scary and strange place for me. However, I have an idea that I would like to put out there.

I'm not sure if this already exists but I thought it might be really interesting and productive if we could create a sub-reddit that was for bipartisan solutions. I would imagine it to be a place where the left and the right start with an idea or problem, discuss each others concerns or ""must haves"" and try to compose a solution that satisfies both sides. Since no one in DC seems to be able to do this, I thought we could give it a shot. If we came up with something good, we could all send it to our leaders. Let me know what you think! and........ugh.......con.....congratulations......you won..... 

Edit: Thanks for the awesome feed back guys. Someone below has created the sub-reddit. Please go check it out and lets get some ideas going. I think the first step would be to pick our starting issue. One that would be fairly easy to compromise on. Any ideas? Put them in the sub-reddit. Thanks!

I was just chatting with an old friend who is in the service right now. He was telling me all about how funny it is that people make comments like, ""Let's curb stomp all the liberal faggots,"" and, ""We should drive a tank over the whole lot of them,"" (in reference to a bunch of tied up occupiers lying facedown on the pavement). He also informed me of the hysterics of a picture of a woman who was severely bruised and bloodied with a caption that read, ""Dumb bitch. Last time she ever makes me a sandwich with beef when I asked for ham."" I lost my cool and argued with him a bit and told him that those things were hugely offensive, and a third party (yes, unfortunately this was on Facebook) decided to cut into our argument to add, ""What we all should be doing..... is thanking andrew here for his service, so thank you."" WTF?? Are you fucking kidding me?!

This kid literally spends 12 hours a day on Facebook and apparently searching the internet for this ridiculous crap. Yeah, real fucking heroic, bro. I'm sorry I decided against starting off every conversation with my sincerest thanks for wasting our tax dollars in order to breed a culture of hate. It's like you can never say anything to a soldier other than to thank them for their service without being antagonized to no end.

You know what, bud? I'm not sorry. And I don't care if you never forgive me for that. I cannot respect you.

I may not have been shipped halfway across the world, but I fight my battles here at home every day. I can GUARANTEE I've changed more lives than you have. Just because I don't have a convenient badge I can use to flaunt it doesn't mean that you are any better than I am. While you're busy Googling racist jokes and finding new ways to insult women, I'm out protecting the people I care about. I fight for the future of education, for reproductive justice, for equality for all. And I don't require a paycheck to do so. But you don't see me posting fucking spam every day about how grateful everyone should be that I'm around.

I have read and seen a lot of shit but this just kind of stunned me. I have heard this said once before by a coworker who was home schooled by his pastor father, was sent to a private christian school, then was told the only way his family would pay for his college was if he attended the bible college his father also taught at. 

I used to talk to him about the most random topics because when you learn a grown man has no idea how the female body works but 100% no abortions even for life of the mother. Homework from the college on speeches on how masturbation is bad with completely false science on blinding people and something about turning you gay. And of course the fact that the reason that liberals want gay marriage is to allow pedophilia to be legal, liberals are lowering the countries resistance first.

Oppression = no Tax Cuts for the rich; failure of government to enforce the Laws of Jesus

Laws of Jesus = ask Glenn Beck

Rights = Tax Cuts for the rich; federal benefits for Real Americans

Socialism = no Tax Cuts for the rich; other people's federal benefits

Communism = having to buy health insurance from for-profit businesses

Tyranny = no Tax Cuts for the rich with a black President

Freedom of Speech = The right to make offensive comments without consequences

Life = a short period of exalted human value beginning at conception, ending at birth, and returning when someone wants to die

Liberty = Tax Cuts for the rich; enforced conformity to 1950s social norms

Pursuit of Happiness = crusading for Tax Cuts for the rich; accumulating stuff; firing guns; feeling superior to someone

Big Spending = money spent on things they don't profit from

Legitimate Government = money spent on things they profit from

Deficit = really big number used to scare voters; irrelevant when Republican is President; existential threat when Democrat is President

Tax Cuts = magic engine of prosperity and growth; signal to job producers to make more jobs; certainly not about the rich getting richer; reduction in federal revenue irrelevant to National Debt

National Debt = bad; a black hole destined to destroy everything good in the world that mysteriously loses its power and significance when Republicans are in control of the budget; result of Democrat Big Spending.

Private Debt = good; a mechanism by which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer

Class Warfare = a discussion of wealth that might be heard by members of the middle class; mentioning growing wealth gap

National Defense = see Legitimate Government.

National Security = secret activities that would otherwise be illegal

Homeland Security = secret Legitimate Government

Nation Building = Democrat foreign wars

Defense of Freedom = Republican foreign wars

Government Waste = see Big Spending

Jobs = something voters want that becomes significant around elections

Job Creators = future aristocrats

Small Business = Koch Industries

Growth = increasing corporate profits and capital gains

Privatization = turning public functions into profit opportunities

Voter Fraud = Democrat victory

Fair Election = long lines only in cities; working class people losing a day’s pay in order to vote

Racism = historical social problem that ended in 1968

Reverse Racism = belief that Racism still exists

Justice = to be defined

Judicial Activism = court decisions they don't like

Judicial Restraint = court decisions they like

Constitution = piece of paper sometimes useful for Judicial Restraint; source of 2nd Amendment and a bunch of words

States’ Rights = justification for returning programs, regulations and the enforcement of civil rights to states

Return to States = eliminate

Illegal Alien = brown people who have recently come to America

Immigrant = white people whose grandparents came to America

Real American = white people who don't know how they got here; Republican

Those People = descendants of slaves who don’t vote Republican

Morality = Laws of Jesus as applied to other people

Abstinence = the practice of every sexual act except one in order to remain a virgin (women); a cover story for closet cases (men)

Jesus = someone really powerful who loves them no matter what they do and who will someday punish people they don't like

Lip Service = all Jesus asks of us; see also Abstinence",,False,self,t5_2qxt5,1352587028.0,,,True,t3_12zdrk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/12zdrk/handy_guide_to_republican_rhetoric/,

&gt;Gov. Romney: But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is **every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.** No tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier.

&gt;If you're getting interest from a bank, if you're getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don't have to worry about filing taxes on that, because **there'll be no taxes for anybody making $200,000.00 per year and less, on your interest, dividends and capital gains.**


So people earning less than $200k per year will not see any taxes AT ALL on interest, dividends, and capital gains. My question is: don't many people live off of these things and thus they don't have an income?

I've noticed that they come to these INSANE conclusions from things that are hardly even related. I also noticed there is A LOT of unfair hype against Obama, and how he's a Muslim, atheist, foreign-born, drug using, communist, fascist who wants to take over America and rule/destroy/reign master over all at once. 

According to the kind of logic I have learned from Fox News and other sources, I have compiled a list of reasons why I will vote for Obama this election:

Reasons I'm voting for Obama:
He cured cancer.
He adopted every orphan in the world.
He thinks my hair style is nice.
He's quarterback for the New Orleans Saints.

Please spread the word so that people can know what a wonderful person Obama is.

The Southern Poverty Law Center designated the Family Research Council a ""hate group"" for statements such as this:

""One of the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the prophets of a new sexual order.""

Which, I can say, is at least *semi*-hateful.

In response, however, some have begun to designate the SPLC as a ""left wing hate group."" Hate towards whom, exactly? Those who state that homosexuality actively encourages pedophilia? I don't quite understand. If I call a racist ""hateful"", am I then a ""hateful Liberal""? It seems more like a way of turning the tables on civil rights advocacy groups, as opposed to addressing the hateful nature behind their own philosophies.

Before I vote, my reasoning needs to stand up to criticism so I am giving you a chance to talk me into changing my vote to Obama.",jctennis123,105,57,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/124k9g/im_a_voter_in_the_battleground_state_of_nc_today/,"First of all, let me preface this with saying that I believe a strong middle class is the best thing for the United States. I want the government to be transparent and honest. I think that moderate regulation is good. I would love for more money to go to NASA (every $1 that goes into NASA gives our economy $8 b/c of their innovations). I think the government spends very frivolously. I like personal liberties and think that it's fine if homosexuals get married or if a woman chooses abort a pregnancy. I want more people to get jobs. I do not like government debt. I don't like that the United States military is spread out all over the world but lets face it, we are a very peace/democracy oriented people and our mega-power keeps the rest of the world at peace. Without us, there would be a power void that might be filled by militant islam or worse. 

I think that we have moved from capitalism to corporatism in this country. I do not like it when corporations pay off government officials or work together (like the oil companies do) to screw over the rest of us. Wal-Mart pays their employees so little that Wal-Mart employees collectively get 2.66 billion in food stamps a year. Wal-Mart's profit is over $15 billion. So basically a large percentage of their profit is a government subsidy. Pay your workers more!!! 

After reading what Ben Stein said yesterday on Fox &amp; Friends about taxing the rich leads to a strong middle class, then that seems like a good course (however, does anyone know if this is simply correlation and not causation?). I think it's stupid that a very small percentage of people control a very large percentage of wealth. I think people who have $10 million are doing great but when you have $100 million or $1 billion in personal assets something needs to be done. At that point you can corner the market and remove competition for yourself which sucks for everyone else. 

I DON'T like the attacks on Mitt Romney over on r/politics. It has moved from arguing political points to frontpage personal attacks by random bloggers. You guys think that their is so much republican voter fraud and no mention of [democrat voter fraud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT77qP2Nai8&amp;feature=youtu.be). Also the mainstream media seems to be very pro-Obama which freaks me out a little bit. 

So here are my main reasons that I am voting for Mitt Romney. I will try to keep this short and only list the most important ones. 

I believe that both candidates are very pragmatic and really do want to find the best way to move America forward. Both candidates have big corporate sponsors. Both candidates are in the top 1%.

I also think that a candidate will very often say one thing and then do another once in office. You never really know what you're going to get so you have to rely on their past record. 

1. Obama increased the federal debt $4 Trillion. This is the most important reason that I do not want to vote for him. I don't see any changes coming from him in this area. Mitt Romney balanced the budget in Massachusetts, in the Olympics, and in his businesses. 
2. The bailouts sucked. It was good to bail out the auto industry because that saved American jobs and they have paid or are paying the debt back but a lot of money went to foreign banks like AIG and companies that went bankrupt. I would have liked to see stipulations placed on the executives of these companies for receiving the money though too. 
3. There is no way Obama can raise taxes on the rich no matter how much he wants too. Congress won't let him. However, Mitt Romney actually could. I'm not saying he will, but there is a higher chance of him raising taxes on the wealthy then Obama doing it. 
4. It is becoming clear that Obama lied about the Benghazi incident presumably to look good. I am guessing this isn't the first time. If you are the president you cannot lie! Stop lying. People say Mitt Romney lies more than anyone. But as far as I can see these lies are contradictions about what he is going to do or what his plan is. Everything that you say that is going to happen in the future is technically a lie b/c you don't know what will happen. Having a plan or changing it is fine but you can't lie about what happened in the past. 
5. It has been over 8% unemployment for almost the entire Obama term. Time to give someone else a chance. Mitt Romney has a plan to create 12 million jobs. I don't know if he can do this or not (I doubt it) but it is like Kennedy saying we are going to get to the moon by the end of the decade. It is a national goal. It is good to have direction. I like this. 
6. Congress is getting nothing done and has the lowest approval rate in history at 13%. Obama's leadership has caused repbulicans and democrats to hate each other. Mitt Romney can work across the aisle better. He got a lot done in Massachusetts even though the legislator was mostly democratic. Obama isn't helping people work together. 

So there you have it. The main reasons I am voting for Mitt Romney are economic because that affects me the most. 

Edit: After reading and responding to many of these (I am not done yet) I have come to one of two conclusions. I have not seen a good enough argument to change my mind or I am not as open minded that I thought. :/ 

Here are the best arguments I have seen against Romney so far:
-His record in Massachusetts actually had  very low job growth
-When he left office his approval rate was 36%
-Most businessmen-presidents have governed the country worse

Yikes. At the end of the day though the debt is still $4 trillion greater when Obama said he would cut it in half. If you could explain what is up with that then that might convince me. However, I think my premise has been wrong the whole time. I want to vote for Romney (didn't end up hitting the polls yesterday) because I think he will be better for the economy. But the fact is, economists are split on who the better candidate is. So after that it comes down to other issues like social issues (obama is better) and foreign policy issues (they are basically the same on this). At this point I am just worried that Obama will increase the debt by another $4 trillion which we will all pay taxes on. Also Obama never got taxes raised on the rich like he wanted.",,False,self,t5_2qxt5,1351362262.0,,,True,t3_124k9g,http://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/124k9g/im_a_voter_in_the_battleground_state_of_nc_today/,

I made my way back to the institution for parents weekend.  I did not know that Rick Santorums son was now a student there.  I was walking down the sidewalk and saw the man himself.  Rick Santorum, shaking hands with the people around him.

It was obvious to me that he thought he was safe here at this bastion of Southern Antiquity.  I approached him with a smile and an extended hand, clearly showing my gold Citadel ring.  

Santorums facial expression suggested a man who was completely at home and comfortable.  

I shook his hand and said

""I don't want to piss you off but you look like that asshole Rick Santorum.""

His face fell.  What had obviously been a happy day of relaxation had now turned sour.  He just stood there, a fallen look taking over his face.  

I stepped back, waved and then left.

(Throw away account since I live in the area and don't want Right wing goons or former classmates finding me and retaliating) 
(Edit:  Apparently you should always write conservatives as Bad guys, and not try to make the reader empathize with them.  Apparently my portrayal of Santorum as a human being didn't sit well with some people.  Ah well, if I do this again I will make sure to cast him in a more negative light.  No changes made)
(Edit 2: Apparently I am a bad person for calling Santorum an asshole.  Well at the time I felt it had to be done.  Would I do it again?  Probably.  But I would first get my picture taken with him, then tell him ""I don't want to offend you but you look like Rick Santorum.""  Apparently that is okay, because it's funny and I don't call him an asshole.  Anyway thanks for the feedback and making me take a closer look at myself.

Opinion by Roberts. [HERE IS THE OPINION](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf)

Ginsburg writes separately for the liberal wing of the Court. Kennedy dissents. 

Updates coming as I can get them out. 

Decision is ""very complicated."" 

Plain English, per SCOTUSblog: 

&gt;The Affordable Care Act, including its individual mandate that virtually all Americans buy health insurance, is constitutional. There were not five votes to uphold it on the ground that Congress could use its power to regulate commerce between the states to require everyone to buy health insurance. However, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn't comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.

More plain English: 

&gt;Essentially, a majority of the Court has accepted the Administration's backup argument that, as Roberts put it, ""the mandate can be regarded as establishing a condition -- not owning health insurance -- that triggers a tax -- the required payment to IRS."" Actually, this was the Administration's second backup argument: first argument was Commerce Clause, second was Necessary and Proper Clause, and third was as a tax. The third argument won.

The first paragraph from the SCOTUSblog write-up about it (which is still a work in progress; it was copied to the liveblog): 

&gt;Salvaging the idea that Congress did have the power to try to expand health care to virtually all Americans, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld the constitutionality of the crucial – and most controversial — feature of the Affordable Care Act. By a vote of 5-4, however, the Court did not sustain it as a command for Americans to buy insurance, but as a tax if they don’t. That is the way Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., was willing to vote for it, and his view prevailed. The other Justices split 4-4, with four wanting to uphold it as a mandate, and four opposed to it in any form.

**Roberts joins the liberal wing of the Court in UPHOLDING the mandate as constitutional.** 

&gt;For readers of the opinion, a quick look at pp. 31 and 32 of Roberts' opinion tells you why the Court is sustaining as a tax measure.

Medicaid provision is limited but not invalidated. 

&gt;***the entire ACA is upheld, with the exception that the federal government's power to terminate states' Medicaid funds is narrowly read.***

According to SCOTUSBlog, ""Chief Justice Roberts' vote saved the ACA."" So 5-4, with Kennedy...in the dissent?

&gt;***The money quote from the section on the mandate: Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power, and that Section 5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax. This is sufficient to sustain it.***

` `

&gt;The court reinforces that individuals can simply pay the tax and not comply with the mandate.

On Medicaid: 

&gt;On the Medicaid issue, a majority of the Court holds that the Medicaid expansion is constitutional but that it w/b unconstitutional for the federal government to withhold Medicaid funds for non-compliance with the expansion provisions.

Also on Medicaid: 

&gt;The key comment on salvaging the Medicaid expansion is this (from Roberts): ""Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the ACA to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that states accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding."" (p. 55)

On severability: 

&gt;The Court does not reach severability issues, having upheld the mandate 5-4.

**BIG DEAL: COMMERCE CLAUSE!** -- Would have struck the mandate!

&gt;The Court holds that the mandate violates the Commerce Clause, but that doesn't matter b/c there are five votes for the mandate to be constitutional under the taxing power.

More Commerce Clause: 

&gt;Justice Ginsburg makes clear that the vote is 5-4 on sustaining the mandate as a form of tax. Her opinion, for herself and Sotomayor, Breyer and Kagan, joins the key section of Roberts opinion on that point. She would go further and uphold the mandate under the Commerce Clause, which Roberts wouldn't. Her opinion on Commerce does not control.

Key language re: Commerce Clause: 

&gt;the money quote on the fifth vote to hold that the mandate is not justified under the Commerce Clause (recognizing that doesn't matter because there were five votes under the Tax Power): ""The power to regulate commerce presupposes the existence of commercial activity to be regulated."" That will not affect a lot of statutes going forward.

On the Anti-Injunction Act: 

&gt;The Court holds that the Anti-Injunction Act doesn't apply because the label ""tax"" is not controlling.

Kennedy's dissent: 

&gt;In opening his statement in dissent, Kennedy says: ""In our view, the entire Act before us is invalid in its entirety.""

**Commentary on Commerce Clause, Necessary &amp; Proper:**

&gt;The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress's authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code -- especially in the current political environment -- to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.

At least one SCOTUSblog author disagrees with the above interpretation, saying: 

&gt;I dissent from Lyle's view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.

Footnote 11, re: options under the law

&gt;Footnote 11, which is on page 44 of the slip opinion: Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance and pay lower taxes. The only thing that they may not lawfully do is not buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.

As to page length: 

&gt;By the way, the opinions collectively are a monster. The Chief's opinion is 59 pages, Justice Ginsburg's opinion is 61 pages, the four dissenters are 65 pages, followed by a short two-pager from Justice Thomas. You do the math.

As to whether the policy is a good idea: 

&gt;From the beginning of the Chief's opinion: ""We do not consider whether the Act embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted to the Nation's elected leaders. We ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions.""",,False,self,t5_2qxt5,1340896519.0,,,True,t3_vqoib,http://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/vqoib/supreme_court_upholds_the_individual_mandate_as_a/,

Living temporarily with my mother - who watches Fox News like it's going out of style, or something - is a daily reminder of how different I seem to be (especially politically) from them. Furthermore, any dissent is met with swift retribution from everybody at once (I will seriously get phone calls from my sisters within ten minutes of walking away from a political debate from my mother), and in my currently-hectic life, there isn't much room for me to stir things up with the people I live with and deal with the resulting stress (as much as I'd like to try and have thoughtful discussions with them, sometimes), so I typically keep quiet. Nevertheless, if I make a comment on a friend's liberal-leaning Facebook post (or something), one of them will notice, and I'll hear about it.

Most recently, I was reading about how several people (in Ohio, I think) had been sentenced to prison over failure to pay their (small) debts, and my sister (by far the worst person with whom to start an argument, and whom I avoid doing so with) noticed it and chimed in. We had a discussion. I speculated that it sounded to me like something out of a Dickens book, and that it didn't seem like a good idea, and that imprisoning people for failure to pay small debts would likely cost us more money, even in the short term.

""Put them in prison!"" she shouted at me (The following is of course not exactly what was said, but nonetheless, covers the same points). ""They don't contribute shit to the system! They don't pay taxes, they abuse government aid programs, and they don't even want to better themselves. They don't want to be a part of the system, they just want to abuse it. There are black guys in Detroit who father six kids out of wedlock and don't work at all so they can't pay child support, so they don't have to.""

Never mind that it wasn't quite the points the article was touching upon.

""They need to know that they can't get away with that,"" she continued. ""Take away their freedom to get away with it. Put them in prison. Then, people around them will see that they can't get away with it, either. Their ten illegitimate children won't think it's okay to walk around with their iPhone 5s while their mommy and daddy are living off welfare and food stamps that people who actually contribute to the system have to pay for.""

""I had food stamps,"" I said.

""That's not your money,"" she said. ""You didn't do shit to earn it.""

""I worked and I paid taxes. I still have debt, too, and I can't pay any of it off right now. Should I be put in prison?""

""No, because that's reasonable debt. Your brother will be a quarter of a million dollars in debt when he's done with med school. Your little sister has student debt. My husband has debt. Student debt is okay, because you're working toward getting a job to pay it off. These people in Detroit (she lives near Detroit, by the way, so complaints like this about people in Detroit are heard from her daily) have no desire to better themselves at all, and are perfectly content just living off of the system that Obama feels the rest of us need to pay into.""

""Isn't that what those programs are for, though? Helping people get out of poverty, or at least exist until they can do better for themselves?""

""No, because they don't want to.""

""How do you know?""

""They don't. They're lazy and would rather live off the system than put in any amount of hard work to better themselves.""

I could see that our discussion had reached the point where it would basically turn into an infinite loop, so I pretty much shrugged the rest of it off.

How much of a problem is this, though?

These are the types of thoughts they have about a lot of things. I'm an educator, for example, and since they appear to have no actual interest in education (besides ""having one"", which they all do/are getting), they subscribe to the ideas about businesspeople running schools, even when I bemoan the massive charter corporations who are failing our students by teaching them how to take standardized tests and removing arts programs.

""Well, the teachers who are there can't teach our kids any better,"" they say. ""They still can't pass the tests.""

""That's not the point, though,"" I'll say. ""The tests don't really measure a whole lot, except students' ability to take those tests.""

""Well, what's our money going into, then?""

""Teaching kids useful skills and subjects and having them interested in learning things they want to learn about.""

""No,"" they'll reply, shrugging off whatever I have to say on the matter. Even when what I have to contribute is true, or supported, I might as well talk to a brick wall.

So, I keep quiet when I can. I talk on the internet, sometimes (but, as you can see from the earlier example, they catch that, too). I'm not immune to their consistent pushing their own beliefs on me, though; I can't prevent them from coming to me, or calling me, and saying things like ""Did you hear about...? This is why Obama needs to go!""

This was mostly a rant, I guess. It drives me nuts, and I don't know how better to deal with it.
