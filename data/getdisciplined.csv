Previous summers, I would work at McDonald's for the July and August (highschool summers) but now that I have May-September off school I'm trying to use this time in order to develop strong habits for next school year (bombed this year).

I'm a bartender during the night at a popular club (I live in a tourist, beach destination in Canada) so my shifts normally start around 6 or 7 and go til 3. 

My question is, instead of sleeping the day away what can I do to fill my time productively? 

I currently exercise regularly (lifting weights at the YMCA), run whenever the urge strikes, and I'm practicing coding on codeacademy. Just starting. It's interesting me a lot, really. . but not something I want to wake up and work from 9-5 on before my real job. I also eat quite clean and avoid drinking most of the time, unless it's a special occasion like a buddies birthday.

So my tl;dr question is this: **how can I productively fill my time for this summer, and come out a better man than I was before?**

Obviously my first step is waking up earlier. Have been reading tips on that from this subreddit (just discovered this yesterday). Any help you guys have would be greatly appreciated!!

1364647053.0,548,self.getdisciplined,1basf8,Weird trick that worked great for me.,madplayshd,616,68,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1basf8/weird_trick_that_worked_great_for_me/,"I heard this from another redditor and thought he was joking first, but it works great. 

Basically, before you do anything, you count to 5. Once you reach 5, you simply do it. So how is this different from just doing it? Well, you dont only do it for difficult stuff, but for *everything*. Before you get up to order another beer, count to five. Before you shut down the computer and go to bed, count to five. Before you stand up and pee, count to five.

This way your brain starts to associate 'counting to five' with the impulse to do stuff. The trick here is that counting to five is easy, doing stuff can be hard. But by hardwiring your brain to do stuff once you reach the number five, you get around this issue. I really had problems getting out of bed, for example. Not anymore. I count to five and stand up. Works every time. Actually, I am now at the point where I would get up without counting anyway, but I still count, to reinforce the counting. I sometimes even have to restrict myself not to start counting just because a weird idea pops into my head.

Discipline is basically like a muscle. If you lived like a total slob for years you cannot expect to change into arnold overnight. If your goals are unrealistically high, you will not reach them. You have to slowly build discipline. This little trick can help you overcome the first barrier, and once you have done things like getting out of bed right away a couple dozen times, it becomes more and more easy. Your discipline grows and you can now start to work on bigger stuff!

Another nice thing with this technique is that it helps you focus on discreet, solvable goals instead of really big, complex problems. Instead of 'I will stop beeing a slob beggining today!' which is neither measurable nor well defined, you break it down to 'get up in the morning' 'brush teeth every evening' 'clean the house every week'. And by reaching those small goals, you not only start to feel good about yourself, suddendly you solved your big problem.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1basf8,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1basf8/weird_trick_that_worked_great_for_me/,
1373969869.0,523,self.getdisciplined,1iel81,"The hidden enemy behind all failure - The urge of Anxiety and the ""Dopamine"" Craving",becomingmanofsteel,610,87,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1iel81/the_hidden_enemy_behind_all_failure_the_urge_of/,"Maybe you are a writer, writing a short book on a topic. You know that there is a need in the market for this topic. You know it will make you a little bit of money and increase your reputation as an author. You know the steps.

Or maybe you are a programmer, making a product on a specific problem. You know multiple people have told you about this problem. You see a lot of products out there but they don't solve the problem directly. You know making this product will give you extra income maybe enough for you to quit your day job. You know how to make it. 

You have to research a lot, then write the first draft. The revise and publish. 

You open the internet browser, doing research on the topic. You have opened a number of tabs, your mind is processing information on multiple threads. Then suddenly the ""hurricane"" raises its head. You don't know it yet. It is getting stronger by each second. 

If you are a writer you begin to doubt yourself about your credibility and start getting depressed. 

If you are a programmer you begin to doubt yourself about the architecture of the product. What if the product comes out all wrong?

Before you know you have started doing something that makes you feel good. It can be eating, watching youtube videos(or movies) or searching on the internet for a magic bullet that will fix everything. And you realise you have wasted 2 hours (or more) in the process. You feel like shit and don't feel to again start working or researching. You went on a ""dopamine"" binge. 

*What is the **""hurricane""**?*

It is an urge. It can be anxiety, fear, despair, disgust etc. 

Our brains don't like feeling uncomfortable. Everytime you are attempting something beyond your skill level or doing something you have never done before, you will get uncomfortable. Then suddenly out of nowhere, any of the above will rise inside you. If you don't know they are coming, they will destroy your time before you will know it and stop you from working. 

*What is **""dopamine""**?*

It is a feel good chemical secreted in the brain when we enjoy something. It can be a movie or an experience or even your work. 

It gives a high that lasts for a short period of time. But the next time you attempt the same activity, the activity needs to be more intensely enjoyable to experience the same dopamine kick. 

Read the above paragraph again, carefully. 

So if you are getting a dopamine fix by watching porn, you have to watch more and more kinky porn to achieve the same effect. 

If you are doing substance abuse to escape from the uncomfort of taking responsibility for your life. You have to ingest more and more quantities of the same to get the dopamine kick. 

*The **""See-Saw""** of Life*

The more you get caught up in the ""hurricane"" (feeling afraid or depressed or anxious), the more the urge to suppress it with the ""dopamine"". You will try to release all the pressure by drugs or food or porn and masturbation or something else. 

It also works the other way around. You want a dopamine kick by using a certain thing. To maintain the same level of high, you need more of the stimuli. The more you want the ""dopamine"" high, the more problems you accumulate. 

More drugs will waste more money and more time. More porn and masturbation will waste more time and more money.

And even a little discomfort of anything will drop you into the ""hurricane"". Yes, even living your day to day life will become a challenge. 

Hiding these behaviours will lead to more anxiety and fear. And you get caught up in the vicious circle. 

This ""hurricane"" and ""dopamine"" are the two sides of the same coin. Its head's I win and tails you ""lose"". 

One more thing to remember is that all this behaviours are habits. These habits waste your time and make you weak. You are the average of your own habits. For example - 

Out of a 24 hour period - your emotional state distribution may be - 

* 7 hours sleep
* 4 hours hard at work (in a flow)
* 2 hours angry or negative
* 2 hours anxious or afraid
* 1 hour lazy
* 2 hours depression
* 1 hour exercise
* 5 hours dopamine binge (internet or/and partying or/and movies or/and substance abuse)

These are habits. Just before you waste time, there is an urge. You don't recognise it and it takes control over you. A chain reaction starts and a lot of your time is wasted. You just made this particular emotional state stronger. It will come back tommorrow in a better shape to haunt you and humiliate you.

*What is the **way out**?*

It's a plain old thing called ""mindfulness"". It is not rocket science. 

It's being aware of your own thoughts, feeling, emotions and sensations moment to moment. You observe your own breath and sensations. You learn to recognise the changes in the pattern of breathing and sensations as various urges and emotions strike you. By practising mindfulness, you begin to recognise the urges as they start to rise. 

It is a skill that is learnable. The more skilled you are in observing these urges, the more choices you will have. 

The choice to do the important hard work that builds your skills or wasting time on the internet. 

The choice to help someone or waste time feeling despair and depression. 

The choice to bravely make a difference or being a coward (and watch porn). 

*How to learn the skill called **mindfulness**?*

There are numerous teachers and institutes that teach it. I chose [this place](http://www.dhamma.org/) since they taught it for free, they call it the Vipassana meditation. It is an intense crash course in the technique over a period of 10 days. 

Just remember this skill takes a lifetime to master. You will just be able to learn the basics in 10 days. 

You can also read this book [Mindfulness in Plain English](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html). But just reading it won't help. I would recommend going on a course where you will learn it from a qualified teacher. 

And no mindfulness is not Buddhism, it is just one of the major teaching in the Buddhist meditations. 

*Will I get something if I practice ""mindfulness"" or I will just loose all my favourite emotional states?*

You will find a few emotional states increasing in time duration and intensity. You will be more equanimous, compassionate, sympathetic and loving. The package deal of all these emotions is called ""inner peace"". 

""Inner peace"" is a term that represents the state of mind when it is in the above four emotions. Please note that ""inner peace"" can make you very uncomfortable and painful when you are helping others and solving their problems. The point is not being anxious or afraid or negative. Problems of all kinds (death, loss, disease, separation or hard work) are painful. 

So gradually your emotional habits will change and these will become your major emotions. 

*What is being ""equanimous""?*

An equanimous person does not gets subdued by failure or gets too happy when succeeding. Such a person works in a calm, composed and friendly manner. 

Maybe it is you when you wake up and make breakfast for your kids. Maybe it is you when you are working in your job and solving problems. Maybe it is when you are vounteering in a non profit in work that changes lives. 

This emotion is a part of you. Mindfulness would increase this part the most. 

The practice will also increase in small amounts compassion and sympathy. You will find yourself doing random acts of kindness for family and strangers. You may find yourself actively volunteering for some cause. And you will feel the pain of the others around you.

*How has it helped me?*

Change has been gradual. There have been ups and downs. When I started, I was struggling in college and under massive debt. After increasing my mindfulness muscle, I studied hard, finished college, got a job, paid off my debt, quit my job and become a freelancer. 

I am currently struggling as a freelancer. I am quite prone to anxiety and fear attacks. The above two examples of the writer and the programmer are taken from my personal life. 

This is a brief snapshot of my habits before 4 years. 

Before Mindfulness - emotional habits over a period of 24 hours - 

* 6 hours sleep
* 0 hours hard at work (in a flow)
* 4 hours working/studying angry or negative
* 4 hours working anxious or afraid
* 2 hours depression
* 1 hour exercise
* 3 hours anxious on internet (searching for magic bullet or just random reading)
* ~4 hours dopamine binge (gaming or movies or porn or just with friends)
* 10 mins meditation - mostly mantra meditation
* 0 hours volunteering

After practising mindfulness for 4 years - emotional habits over a period of 24 hours. 

* 7 hours sleep 
* 6 hours hard at work (4 hours in a flow + 2 hours)
* 0 hours working angry or negative
* 2 hours working anxious or afraid (generally when deadlines are to met)
* 15 mins depressive thoughts
* 1.5 hours exercise
* 3 hours anxious + dopamine binge on internet (searching for magic bullet or right architecture or being a perfectionist or just random reading)
* 30 mins dopamine binge (mostly youtube videos) - gave up gaming and porn, rarely watch movies
* 1 hour - 2 hours Vipassana meditation (Sitting meditation and being aware of breath, thoughts and feelings while travelling), Also try to be mindful all day
* 1 hour - 2 hours - volunteering (A few times a week, on an average more than 1 hour)

I am still learning mindfulness. I have made some baby steps over the past few years. 

One important thing this practice has made me realise that I am completely responsible for myself - physically, financially and emotionally. I have to handle my own emotions, work on my skills to be better financially and no one else can do it for me. (But time and again, I do go down on the rabbit hole of the internet searching for the magic bullet about anything related to coding or architecture or others. Old habits die hard.)

&gt; as a 59 year old (in his third career, with an awesome/sexy wife and 4 great kids), I really sympathize with the feeling of uncertainty/dread/hope that courses through one’s being in the 20′s. lemme suggest a few things to ponder –

&gt; 1- You CAN succeed. Just start busting ass, and make it a lifestyle. Commit 8-10 hours a day to your economic effort and results will turn up.

&gt; 2- Don’t waste too much time finding the exact perfect fit. You will starve before it happens. Just get your hands moving, pile up experiences and credentials; pay your dues. Opportunities will come.

&gt; 3- Being paid is a two-sided exchange. People give you their money when you give them what THEY want. If you solely focus on what YOU want to deliver without reference to the marketplace, you are headed for failure.

&gt; 4- the flip-side of the butt-busting lifestyle is to commit yourself to stop the cyber-loafing. It is white sugar in the soul; It is your death sentence if you continue it. I see some guys in my place of work surfing on the job… they are uniformly shirkers and going nowhere. First to be fired. The best way to handle it is to designate a specific hour or half hour a day for web recreation, and then hustle the rest of the time.

&gt; 5- gain achievement through accomplishment (a vibrant character and things you build), not through purchased status (tattoos, cars, gear). Anybody can write a check for the latter.

&gt; 6- put another way: as Jesus said, you sow seed in the short term and reap the harvest in the long term…. Instant gratification and its cyberloafing cousin are your two biggest enemies. Take the long view.

- You are born
- You go to school for ~20 years, all the while, doing *hard work* based on the promise that you will be *successful*
- You graduate and work for money, still working hard with the intention of arriving at success
- You continue working hard as *life itself seems to get harder*
- You see and read and hear about some people who seemed to have arrived at success, whereby they no longer need to suffer, and success seems to come much more easily to them

And here's the big thesis:

**You need to continue working hard until you arrive at a certain point, success, after which life becomes easy, and even though you may continue to do what you're doing, it no longer involves regular suffering.**

Personally, I just realized that this is how I see life, I discipline myself in hopes of arriving at a point where I no longer need discipline.

---

*So there I was.*

It was late afternoon. I had gone through all of my youtube videos and blog posts about how to stop procrastinating. I was ""prepared"" to get work done. After a particularly productive morning, I had practiced my yoga and meditation in hopes of quelling the sense of dread I get before starting a project. I even started with a healthy breakfast.

I shuffled around my apartment, tying up lose ends, getting a snack, and setting up my work space. Only after every miscellaneous object was put back into place, leaving me no other small tasks to complete did I realize. Oops, I did it again.

I was running out of time, fast. My homework was already late, bills were piling up, and I really had nothing to show for it. It's not like I was busy with *friends* or anything. My chronic procrastination was getting the best of me. 

Despite everything I had done that morning to set myself up for success, I found myself slipping again. I would never finish everything I had to do. I've been doing this my whole life, what makes me think it could be different this time?

I took a second to recognize my emotional state. What was it that was keeping me from moving? Then it hit me. **I'm obsessed with failure**.

---

*Why you're probably here.*

If you're like me, you tend to beat yourself up when you don't meet expectations. **Your fear of ""failure"" is paralyzing**. You may spend hours trying to figure out how to solve this problem, but to no avail. You're stuck in a self-help loop.

---

*Change your focus, and take baby steps.*

It's a really simple thing that you can do, but it does require a small amount of self-awareness. Here's what you do.

1. **Notice when you get that scary feeling in your chest.**
Once  your brain starts to remind you off all those times you screwed up, you'll feel that awful, anxious feeling in your body. Recognize it, and accept it. *Mediation and yoga are a great ways to learn how to do this. Try [this video](http://youtu.be/0o0kNeOyH98) and see how you like it.*

2. *The Trick*: ***Think about how it will feel once you accomplish these tasks.***
Your thoughts have ""gravity."" When you think of your past failures, you start to think of what it was that got you there. You start to gravitate toward that path, because you know exactly how to get there. Focusing on how you'll feel after the task is complete pulls you closer to the positive outcome. You'll ""see"" it, believe it, and eventually do it.

3. *Clock in.* By this time you should start to feel a little excited at the prospects of completing the tasks. Take a few minutes and just feel good for a little bit. Smile :). You're ok. **Block off a set time to begin working.** Be generous with the amount of time you give yourself to just chill, but do the same for work time. You don't want to put yourself in a crunch, do you? 

4. Simple. **Start.** Once that time comes **set a timer** for about 20 minutes. This will be your tool of the trade. Here's a simple [online timer](http://www.online-stopwatch.com/countdown-timer/), doesn't cost a thing, and will catalyze your productivity. [This site]( http://tomato.es/) is a sweet alternative. In the first block of time, focus ONLY on writing down the steps to completing your project. ~~Over~~Estimate how long each substep will take. Decide which ones you want to complete during your block time.  Work in blocks of 20-25 and give yourself 10-15 minute breaks. 

---
*You are on your way*

Know that you're not going to be a workbot immediately. It's going to take some repetition and a few unproductive days, but be sure to give yourself some credit. It's a marathon, don't burn yourself out. Keep your thoughts positive and be sure to celebrate afterward. You deserve it.

This is by far the most important habit you should incorporate in your life. Not only is it scientifically proven that exercise increases [mental health](http://journals.lww.com/co-psychiatry/Abstract/2005/03000/Exercise_and_well_being__a_review_of_mental_and.13.aspx), it also improves the [longevity of your life](http://www.news-medical.net/news/20121112/Exercise-key-to-a-longer-life.aspx). It provides a sense of well-being and nothing beats the feeling of coming home from a work-out, tired and sore and feeling like you actually did something of worth. (Note: Technically not something you should do EVERY day in order for your body to recover, but you get what I am saying. You should workout more).

* **2. Read books**

It started out as only 15 minutes a day, and now I see myself spending more and more time every day reading books &amp; articles on life improvement, philosophy, training etc. By reading books you'll become smarter, sharper, more interesting and learn from the experience of other wise individuals. Through reading, you will discover ideas and certain mentalities that will further enhance your life, and you will expand upon them to create what you may call yourself. 

* **3. Keep a journal** 

Either buy a book you can write in with pen or use the computer to keep a journal. You can either write down a few lines on what happened that day or, if you are feeling philosophical, write paragraphs. Whatever you do, mark down the date and write. There are times where I am really tired and nothing really interesting happened that specific day so I just jot down a few words, and other times I can write several pages on different thoughts, ideas etc. Get your thoughts down on paper. If you want, you can add a quote to every post and reflect on it, as I do. Always write down the best positive experience of the day. You will find yourself being more aware of the positive things that happen throughout the day by doing this. If not for yourself, do it for your kids and grandchildren. If my mom or dad were to keep a journal throughout their life I would read every single bit of it. Your children and/or grandchildren would want to read yours. 

* **4. Sleep more**

Go to bed earlier, and get up earlier. Sitting on facebook or reddit for two hours at night is not going to get you anywhere. Aim for 8-10 hours of sleep every night. I would also recommend getting up earlier than you usually do. This will leave you with good time to get dressed/make breakfast etc. Oftentimes, I have a whole 20-minutes where I am completely ready before I head off to school. Doing this will start of the day a lot more stress-free and as a result of this your entire day will feel the same. You will enter your job/school refreshed and awake. 

* **5. ~~Spend less time on the computer~~ Spend less time being unproductive on the computer and instead do things that matter**

Limit you time on the computer every day. Spend more time with friends, family, kids etc. Do unexpected things. Go for a walk or a hike in the woods. Explore nature. Explore the real world rather than a virtual one. **EDIT:** If you spend your time creatively, i.e building websites, making art etc., then of course this does not apply. My point being is that people usually does not spend their time on it like that, and use it as a distraction, as I did for several years.  If you do creative and wonderful things on the computer, I would not dream of denying you that. However, most people do not use it like that",,False,,t5_2uzju,1362145588.0,,,True,t3_19f1im,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/19f1im/5_simple_habits_you_should_do_every_day_to/,

1375043003.0,380,self.getdisciplined,1j8dvd,PSA--clean your fuckin' room,albatrawesome,456,76,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1j8dvd/psaclean_your_fuckin_room/,"This might either seem really obvious for some or might seem completely overwhelming for others. There's nothing worse than coming home after a stressful day of whatever to a trashed room. Whether you're the type who throws their clothes all over the floor, leaves plates of half eaten food on your desk, or just leaves your bedsheets crumpled up on the corner of your bed...one of life's greatest feelings is having a clean room. 

It might seem overwhelming at first. That pile of clothes will take at least an hour to hang up. If I pick up the plates, that means I'll have to do the dishes. What's the point of making my bed if I'm just going to get back in it later tonight? Here are some reasons why you should clean your fuckin' room. 

1. Your room is (or should be) your slice of the world which offers you peace and comfort. It's such a good feeling to come back from work, school, going out, whatever and opening the door to your room to find a made bed and no clutter. I'm sure many of y'all lead stressful lives, so why should something so easy to control become another stressor? Whenever my room is messy, it's just another reason to get down on yourself. Save yourself the trouble. Clean your fuckin' room. 

2. Your room is a reflection of yourself. Again, this is your little slice of the world and you are in control of how it looks. I'm not even talking about decoration, but order. A room filled with clutter represents a life filled with clutter. No one wants a life filled with clutter. Clean your fuckin' room. 

3. There have been so many times where I had let the state of my room get out of control. In one particular instance, I had clothes everywhere, plates/cups everywhere, my bed wasn't made, the whole room smelled a bit, and my bathroom was a mess. My roommates decided to have a party when I had to study all night, so I was unaware that people would be going into my room to use my bathroom. I was mortified. How many people had seen my room like this? They must have all thought I was a huge slob. I felt like crap. You'll never know who will see your room or what they will think because of what they see in it. Save yourself the embarrassment, clean your fuckin' room. 

4. It is a simple way to make yourself feel good. Do you feel like you haven't been productive today? Do you feel gross or uncomfortable in your own room? Get up and clean. Just start doing it. Start small. Pile up the plates, put all of your clothes in a pile. Have fun! Turn on some music or a movie and just get into that one-track-mind-zone. Pretty soon (and I mean pretty soon, because getting your room totally clean really only takes an hour and a half, max) you'll be done. The reward is a space--your space--that is there to comfort you and keep you relaxed. Reward yourself, clean your fuckin' room. 

5. Getting in the habit of always keeping your room clean helps you live an overall disciplined life. Wake up, make your bed--the rest of the schedule is for you to decide, but the point is you can schedule your entire day knowing that you will always wake up and make your bed. I used to come home between classes and take a nap. I realized this was completely unproductive, so I chose to clean my room in the 50 or so minutes I had. I felt productive and proud, as well as motivated for the rest of the day. Live a disciplined life, clean your fuckin' room. 

I hope this wasn't too patronizing, but maintaining a clean room has really changed my life and my psychology. I rebelled against the idea for years, but after making the decision to live a better life, it became clear that keeping a clean room was essential to living better. You might feel overwhelmed with the idea, but what has always helped me was to read things about being motivated or disciplined. That way I kind of get ""high"" on the idea of living a better life and become instantly charged to do *something*. Cleaning your fuckin' room is a perfect something. Just fuckin' do it.

Please ignore all the ""brahs"" I use. It's just... how we talk over on Bodybuilding.com. I fully realize how ridiculous it sounds after reading over it haha.

&gt;[My simple guide to becoming a super high achieving individual.](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=142183851)

&gt;* 1) Find a goal that you can have a burning desire to achieve. For me my goal is to become independently wealthy and have complete financial freedom and never have to work a 9-5 again. 

&gt;* 2) Write out that goal, write out what you're willing to give to achieve that goal(i.e. 60 hours of work per week), and write out a cohesive plan on how you're going to achieve that goal.

&gt;* 3) Read and visualize your plan every morning and every night.

&gt;* 4) Implement a plan of 10 day no faps. If you can go longer, go for it, but I find 7-10 days is a good number to shoot for.

&gt; And that's basically it. Motivation is the magical ingredient that separates all successful people from unsuccessful people. But most people who aren't motivated think that they can never be motivated. That's simply false. If you're unmotivated, it's not that you CAN'T be super motivated... it's that you are not focusing on the proper goals. The things you're spending your time thinking about aren't what you really want out of life, thus you feel apathetic and lazy and have no desire to do anything with your days but sit around and be lazy.

&gt; Basically these steps come out of a book called ""Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill"". It's consensus of most motivational speakers that this is one of the best books you can read if you want to have a successful life.

&gt; My life in Dec before I implemented this system:

&gt; Wake up around 11am-12pm. Dick around on the internet until I finally dragged my ass to the gym around 3 or 4. Cooked dinner. Then dicked around watching movies, playing games, miscin until 3 or 4am. That was about it.

&gt; My life now:

&gt; Wake up 6am every day. Cook breakfast, meditate 20 minutes, visualize my goals, go to the gym. Go to work around 9:30. Work until 6. Home, dinner, then work on my internet projects until 11:30 or so. Do some reading, meditate a little, then go to bed around midnight, 1am. 

&gt; It's crazy, but I have NEVER been good about having less than 8 hrs sleep(waking up still sucks balls, but after I stand up I'm good to go for the rest of the day). Once I get up and moving though I feel great, just feel so energized and alive and optimistic. In Dec if I got less then 8 hours of sleep I would have dragged ass all day and probably napped multiple times and got absolutely nothing done.

&gt; Try it brahs, the number one thing in life is to have a goal that really gets you excited, that IMO is one of the secret ingredients to living a truly fulfilling life.

**Here is my update. 23 Feb 2013 One Year Later**

In February I was in the process of idea generation. I tried EVERYTHING. Web design for businesses, SEO business, advertising, PPC advertising, building my own niche sites, building affiliate sites, I considered buying a hotdog cart and selling hotdogs, I thought about creating the ""next"" reddit. Lots and lots of ideas. With the overarching intent of creating financial freedom so that I would not have to work a soul-draining 9-5 as an Accountant(I have my degree in Accounting).

In June of 2012 I finally hit on an idea that had potential. Create a website and youtube channel that combines fitness and gaming. This played perfectly with who I am and what my passions were. I've probably spent a good 20% of my entire waking hours playing video games, and another good 20% working out/reading about fitness/nutrition. And intuitively it just FELT right. So in June [www.thehealthygamer.com](http://www.thehealthygamer.com) was created.

* [Here is a screenshot of my earnings for that May and June (the first two months Healthy Gamer was live.)](http://i.imgur.com/q96qani.jpg)

Please don't take this post as a boastful post. My true intent here is to show some DOCUMENTED PROOF of the effectiveness of the principles I wrote about in that thread in Feb of 2012.

**One year ago this time I had - almost no understanding of how to build websites. No knowledge of how to edit video. No knowledge of how to be successful on youtube. No skills in speaking in videos. No connections online aside from posting in internet forums.**

What I did have was an intent, a vision, and a desire to succeed despite all obstacles.

And obstacles aplenty there have been. In September of 2012 I got REALLY depressed. Things weren't going as I had planned/hoped for Healthy Gamer. My earnings were plummeting. Diablo 3 - the game I had covered almost exclusively was dying. Guild Wars 2, my next big hope, turned out to be not nearly as good as the hype. 

I started losing all of my discipline. Was fapping 3-5x a day again. Was staying up until 5-6am and not waking up until 3pm in the afternoon. I become completely anti-social and literally lost my confidence overnight. I didn't make any updates to the website or youtube channel for about 2.5 months.

But I did eventually pull myself together and get re-disciplined. It started with meditation. I am of the belief that meditation is like that swiss army knife. With meditation, you can tackle any other problem life throws your way.

So I started meditating again regularly. Then I set goals again. Then from there it was an explosion of discipline and motivation. I've woken up at 5am for the last seventeen days straight. Have been able to create constant content for the website and youtube and actively improving the quality of each post. The website really is at a point where it is primed for exponential growth. I have done two interviews for local news stations who liked my idea of helping gamers become healthy.

It's been over 120 days since I've watched porn and more than 45 days since I've fapped. 

Looking back on this last year I would say that it certainly has not been easy. It's taken a load of effort. But it's been absolutely worth it. Day to day you will have ups and downs. You need to stay focused on your overarching goals and realize that human beings naturally to have good days and bad days. It is natural to have swings in your mood. It is natural to have swings in your motivation. 

Take advantage of those low-energy times to rest, recharge, and replenish your mind with motivational and inspirational books and audio programs.

1369827995.0,367,self.getdisciplined,1f9hcu,Avoid what is easy. How to find deep satisfaction in life. [x-post /r/minimalism],minimalisto,418,51,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1f9hcu/avoid_what_is_easy_how_to_find_deep_satisfaction/,"This hit me yesterday as I thought about how I spend my time.

I've recognized that I really enjoy reading on new topics, that I enjoy playing guitar, creating programs, and working out.

I am also aware that I spend a lot of time just browsing reddit, watching television, and playing videogames.

Something has always made me aware that video games, tv, etc. aren't what I should be doing with my time. I've finally realized what that is.

Video games, TV, even reddit and other internet sites like YouTube seem to suck us all into them. They are easy. If you want to be entertained, feel some happiness, then just pick up the remote and tune in.

However, they do not give any lasting satisfaction. You don't look back on last week and feel proud and happy that you watched a full season of Star Trek -- and even while you are watching, the amount of happiness you get is a steady trickle, but nothing great.

Consider on the other hand, activities that take work, that aren't easy. Learning about a new subject can feel frustrating or confusing. A skill-based activity like playing the guitar can take months or years to get to a good point, and even then you are constantly trying to improve.

Yet look back on a past week where you nailed a new song, learned a new skill, or had a new experience -- and suddenly there is pride and happiness and satisfaction.

As minimalists we have said we will remove all garbage from our lives so that we can focus on what makes us happy and brings meaning to our lives -- yet so many of us are drawn to the low hanging fruit.

I've seen many people on this subreddit say they spend their time playing video games, watching television, and browsing the internet.

Have you ever wondered why so many people ask ""well if you don't watch TV what do you do?"" ""Aren't you bored?"" -- people who want to quit playing video games have to ask what they could possibly spend their time doing instead.

What people are really searching for is the low hanging fruit. This easy steady drip of happiness. Their question is, if you remove television and other easy drips they know, what do you do instead? What drip have you discovered that they don't know about?

I myself have struggled with this. I want to quit video games, yet looking online people give alternatives like ""going for a walk"", or ""wood working"". In my brain I say ""yeah okay, but what do you do that doesn't take so much work?"" -- I mean who really spends a whole day wood working or walking? They must fill the rest of their time somehow? Where is their easy drip?

Now imagine for a second. What if there were no easy drips? No easy way to get a steady stream of happiness? What if all your happiness and satisfaction and meaning had to be worked for -- hard effort must be applied to everything you do before the happiness will arrive.

You might sit on your ass all day and drink beer, talk with friends, but that is still just an easy drip. What if you remove that as well?

You will find that you will still seek happiness and especially a deep satisfaction with your life. And so you don't sit there blind waiting for something easy to show up, instead you start to work for it.

You find these hobbies, activities that people have been telling you about all along, and you work at them until you have that deep satisfaction and every week can be looked back on with pride.

Each week you will achieve new accomplishments, have new experiences and feel a sense of pride.

Eventually you get addicted to these bigger rushes of happiness, this deep sense of pride and satisfaction, and you simply will not be able to go back to the easy drip of television, video games, or other things.

Addendum:

I think we experience this addiction to hard but satisfying activities on some level.

You might spend most of your day in front of the television, but consistently go to the gym and have completed a strict strength training regime.

You might be a runner, and go out every day running trying to reach that 10k or marathon level.

Ask these people, would they give up their hobby? A resolute NO! is what you will hear.

I'm sure you have something in your life that you feel the same about. It's the deep happiness and satisfaction you feel that makes you so protective over this hard hobby.

We all have these addictions to activities which provide us with bigger flows of happiness, satisfaction, and pride.

What I am suggesting is that if we can remove all of the easy drips of happiness, and truly focus all of our effort on these bigger flows, we can become addicted to more of these hard activites.

Picture whatever it is that grants you so much happiness right now, whatever hobby or activity that may be.

Now imagine if every moment of your day was spent doing activities like it which granted you the same amount of satisfaction, happiness, and pride.

Each day would hold 10x the amount of happiness, you would feel an extremely deep satisfaction that each day, week, month, and year were well spent.

And to me, that sounds as minimalist as you can get.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1f9hcu,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1f9hcu/avoid_what_is_easy_how_to_find_deep_satisfaction/,

  I am turnining to this sub hoping that I can find the inspiration to change my habits and become a happier, livelier, more productive person. But there is one thing that still bothers me, that I haven't seen addressed here yet. To put it plainly: because of the way I've lived over the past 15 years, I am a really boring person. 



I have almost no interesting stories, only a few friends, no hobbies that can share or discuss confidently, zero skills.

I have greasy poorly cut hair, a fat face, and what I fear are dead expressionless eyes.

In fact, I've always jealously made fun of people who did...from my keyboard, after playing video games for 8 hrs straight. I feel envious and alone. 



I dread the, ""what do you do for fun?"" Question. Not because I don't have an answer, but because the answer is ""I touch my penis and pretend to be an elven Mage"". I want a better answer to this, one I can say out loud and then have a conversation about.

I struggle a lot with work and improving myself, and its mostly gaming and internet that seems to be stopping me. However I think I found the thing that is keeping me unhappy and the solution to become happy. 

Here it is: The heuristic with which I regularly torture myself looks like ""I am happy when I improve"" and ""I am unhappy when I stand still"". Until today I think I truly believed this rationally too. Happiness is being your best. The effect of the heuristic can be seen in that I regularly feel very bad that I wasted time. It can also be seen by my enormous effort to improve. Now the question is: Why on earth would I really become happy when I improve, when I can't be happy standing still? What if I can't help but stand still? 

It looks like lots of improvement is haltered by my sadness, where the sadness comes from feeling bad about standing still or ""being old me"", wasting time or doing other stuff that I consider ""bad"". So the solution is to stop yourself, when you are able, to think that you are bad for standing still. Stop thinking you did wrong yesterday, last month, last year. You were not wrong, you simply stood still, and that is ok, because you know that nothing is worse for happiness that blaming you for not improving. The only goal of improving is being happy, and if being happy involves stopping to slap yourself for not improving, too bad that you don't improve.

In another perspective you might say that the first improvement of your life and happiness is to stop blaming non-improvement.

Then I say to myself: don't torment yourself, you like this post, and it is better to stand still and post awful posts than to torture yourself that it is not good enough.

Whether or not you know this, whether or not you realize this, every great achiever has faced yet overcome these four things.   In life these will come in different faces and in different forms but you must not only know, but master overcoming these. Any hobby any job any passion you will be faced with these four things. So overcome them because that is all that is **holding you back**.""

Okay, well not exactly in those words.  But that's the subconscious message that is drilled into your head on a daily basis by intellectuals, professors, your parents, your boss, etc.  As humans, we are taught to value our brainpower above all else.

This is poison.

I'm telling you now that the key to self discipline is TO BE IMPULSIVE.  Stop dwelling on what you should be doing and DO IT NOW.

The second you see a pile of dirty dishes and you think, ""I really ought to clean the kitchen eventually"", you stop what you're doing and you clean the goddamn kitchen.

The second you think, ""It would be cool if I wrote a book about X.  It's a subject I'm really interested in and I enjoy thinking about it"" you stop what you are doing and you write a paragraph or an outline.  Anything.  Just put pen to paper.

The second you think, ""I ought to buy something nice for my mom/girlfriend, but I'm not sure what I should get her"" you stop what you are doing and you pick something to get her and DON'T SECOND GUESS YOURSELF just buy the damn thing and write her a nice note to go with it.

The second you think, ""Wow, that guy is ripped.  I wish I had a body like that"" you STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING and you get on the floor and do 20 pushups with good form.

The second you think, ""My friends are always posting pictures of themselves on Facebook doing fun stuff like going on rollercoasters or swimming at the beach... my life is boring"" you stop what you are doing and you plan a camping trip with some people.

**The second you think, ""I've been spending too much time on the computer.  I should probably get off soon"" you stop what you are doing and get off the goddamn computer.  Don't wait for the clock to strike a nice even number like 6:30.  You get off the computer at 6:26, THE SECOND you think that thought.**

Be impulsive.  Do.

Booze had been a very significant part of my life since I was 16.  I grew up with it, learned that it was ok and was in fact encouraged to drink every day, and that being a boozer was something to wear with a badge of pride.  Hooray for alcoholic parents!

After countless mornings waking up and thinking ""Why on earth would I ever do that again?"" I stopped.  And it's been one of the bigger and more important things I've ever done for myself.

Since I quit, I started looking at other things that are clearly done to excess in my life, things that are distracting me from work I ought to do (both inner and outer).  I didn't want to tackle all of them all at once because I think I'd get overwhelmed and start feeling a bit lost and helpless without all the crutches I've been supporting myself with over the past several years.

So I'm starting small, I'm experimenting, and I'm taking it slow.  First the booze.  Now I'm seeing what happens when I limit my facebook time.  Facefuck has become an addiction for me, a branch of a very large tree of dependencies that is blooming and bearing fruit of endless distraction.  Cutting out facebook entirely seems almost impossible (even though it's not) so I'm starting with a week without it. 

It's been 2 days and I'm feeling some resentment already at myself for the decision.  Which probably means I'm on the right track.  In a way, I'm isolating myself from a large chunk of my social circle.  FOMO is hitting me hard, and I'm really pissed I can't post news articles and other things to my wall to share with my friends.

But, it's given me more time to...just do other things.  Talk to people in real life, do my laundry, make lunch, making my bed...It hasn't felt as victorious as cutting drinking out of my life, but it still feels good.

Next on the list (and I imagine this will be harder...much harder) will be limiting my time Reddit. 

Next will be the computer entirely.

Then sugar (since quitting drinking my sugar cravings have become epic in nature).

Here's the solution,throwawaysdlfjdlsjfl,305,45,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1d3mdw/problems_with_waking_up_on_timegetting_up_in_the/,"[If you don't want to read the wall of text, look below for practical tips]

Typical scenario: it's 1pm by the time you finally drag yourself out of bed, and feel shitty and like you've wasted the whole day already. Or, you hit snooze for the 10th time and finally grudgingly get up and rush out the door, running late. Whatever your particular situation is, you're pissed off at yourself and the fact that you can never get up on time, and that it's always such a struggle.

First off, we have to analyze the cause of failure objectively, and not just dismiss it as a simple lack of willpower, or laziness, or some personal flaw/failure. it's easy to feel like your personal weakness is the problem, and think that by punishing yourself for it, it will resolve the issue in the future. that's the default response that people have to failure, in general. however, that response is incredibly ineffective at creating helpful changes. so, leave all emotions and blame and anger behind, because they are only an emotional response, and won't help us resolve the problem. in fact, having a self blaming attitude will only cause you to lose motivation, as well as create a bad mental atmosphere, neither of which is conducive to achievement.

so, if we look at the issue objectively, we can see that the issue is often caused by vague, ambiguous goals. you think ""i'd like to get up on time tomorrow"" the night before, or you think ""fuck, i feel like today is wasted, i wish i had gotten up on time today"" during the day, but these are not specific enough goals. ""getting up on time"" is a very vague goal, and vague goals are useless because they don't have specific conditions of success or failure, and therefore give no feedback as to how well you're doing. instead of a clearcut way to pinpoint the exact spot where you failed, or identify when you've been successful, you just have this large gray area with vague ideas of when you've been successful and when you've failed.

so start with a very specific goal. for example: ""as soon as my alarm goes off tomorrow, i will get out of bed and stand up, and not get back into the bed after that."" with this goal, you will instantly know if you succeeded or failed- if you succeed, great, you've got it. if you fail, great, now you are closer to pinpointing the problem, and can truly understand WHY failure occurred (but remember to leave emotion and blame and self-punishment out of this, and analyze it objectively).

now that you've set a goal, WANT to achieve it. Think of 3 reasons WHY you WANT to do it, eg. 1) i love being ready on time 2) i feel bad when i don't get up on time, so if i do this, i'll avoid that feeling 3) if i do this, i'll have time to have a nice breakfast, long shower, etc., whatever motivates you. REMEMBER THESE, and write them down and put them next to your alarm clock.

next, make the DECISION to do it. specifically say ""I am going to do [specific goal] tomorrow, at [specific time], i am making the decision to do this right now. i know that i will have to combat [identify common excuses you use to stay in bed/not stick to your goals]. i know it will be hard at first, and i may fail, but i realize that blaming and getting upset at myself for failure will never help me, and instead i should look at failures as valuable information to use to correct the failure, and that i want to FIX the problem, not merely blame myself for it if it happens."" tweak this to whatever you need, but write your decision down and really decide that you'll stick to it.

now, PRACTICE. run through it in your head before you have to do it for real. imagine yourself waking up tomorrow, and then remember your DECISION to get up on time, think of your REASONS and how much you WANT it, you have to know WHY you're doing this, so that you can combat the voice that's saying ""just 5 more minutes"" or ""i don't want to get up"" or a thousand other excuses that will try to talk you out of doing anything difficult.

this all is a good start, and may be all you need. but i thought i'd also share some practical tips:

TIPS:

1. Drink water the night before, so you have to piss really badly when you wake up. this may take a bit of adjustment (too much and you'll wake up during the night and go, too little and you'll be able to hold it the next morning), but it works great

2. Make the habit of getting out of bed IMMEDIATELY when your alarm goes off. don't event think, don't hesitate, just jump out of bed the second you hear the alarm, and you don't give the inner voice a chance to talk you out of it. after just a few days, it will be so automatic that you'll be out of bed and standing up without even thinking about it, every time your alarm goes off. practice this the night before, by lying in bed pretending it's the next morning, and jumping up when you hear (or pretend) your alarm goes off, and you'll be amazed how easy it is to do the next day

3. Put your alarm far away. no need to go crazy here, because if you really have to lock it in a box with a padlock chained to your bed like one guy i saw on reddit, then you have bigger issues to fix first. if it's that hard for you to get up, you either need to get more sleep, or make significant changes to your life, because you are not motivated at all by what you're currently doing with your life. waking up should be the best part of your day, because you get to go back to doing what you love. if you aren't spending your life doing what you love, i suggest your realize that you only get ONE chance at life, you don't get a re-do, you don't get another chance, this is it, this is your one shot at ever doing anything, don't live it as if you've got forever. [edit: several people have said they use the padlocked-box method because it's the only thing that works for them, not because they aren't enjoying their life- if this is the case for you, then don't worry about it. as long as YOU feel that you're living the way you want, that's all that matters. the point is just that it CAN be a warning sign if getting up every morning feels like a horrible chore, that's all]

4. Always get up, no matter HOW long it takes. if you have to lie there for an hour every morning to talk yourself up, then do it. but KEEP doing it, and never let yourself get discouraged. you need persistence, because eventually, even if it takes a week, you'll realize that you aren't going to let yourself off the hook, so you may as well just stop fighting it and get up on time. if you know that you're GOING to get up eventually, it's a lot easier to realize that fighting it is only counterproductive.

5. Sleep in multiples of 1.5 hours- for most people that means 6hrs or 7.5hrs of sleep a night (9 will cause issues, you have problems when you get too much sleep for some reason) ever wake up feeling super alert, fell asleep and woke up 15 minutes later feeling dead? that's because you hit the cycle right at a 1.5 hour mark when you woke up, then put yourself off peak by sleeping more. this matches circaidian rhythms or some shit like that, doesn't really matter you can look up the science and stuff if you're interested, but the point is that you can feel more rested off of 4.5 hours of sleep waking up right on time than you can off of 8 hrs but waking up off peak. try it, and it will blow your mind. give yourself 15 minutes or so to fall asleep, and calculate your time that way. 

6. Buy a space heater and a timer. Set it so that it heats up your room before you wake up. You can use this two ways: 1) if your room is cold, you won't want to get up out of a nice warm bed, so you can make it a lot easier by having a nice warm room instead, or 2) if you really need a drastic measure, set it so that it will be blazing hot in your room by the time you want to wake up. that way, instead of your bed being a nice warm comforting place that you want to stay, it will be a goddamn sauna of sweat and 'oh god get me out of here right now'. basically a space heater is just a way to make what you want (being out of the bed) more desireable, and/or what you don't want (being in bed) less desirable.

7. Put a light on a timer to turn on about 5 minutes before you wake up. The light helps make your body realize that it's time to get up. also, its very easy to go back to sleep in a nice dark room, but when it's bright it's harder to fall back asleep, plus it 'feels' more like you should get up when it's bright out

8. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day (or as often as possible). This may be inconvienient for many people, especially if don't have a stable schedule for work or whatever, but even so, you may find that it's worth waking up early even on days you don't have to, simply to keep the trend going, because your body will very quickly adapt to a sleep schedule (just think of how fast you adjust to jet lag), and you'll begin to wake up right around the time your alarm goes off every morning. also, going to sleep at the same time every night will make that easier too. our bodies LOVE schedules, and will adapt to them quite readily, which can be used to our advantage

hope this helps, and please save a link to this to share next time someone posts about having troubles waking up!

- But its nicer here…

""So you were born to feel nice? Instead of doing things and experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world in order, as best they can?

- But we have to sleep sometime…

""Agreed. But nature set a limit on that – as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not of working. There you’re still below your quota too, and what it demands of you. People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for engraving, the dancer for dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status?

I wanted to get your thoughts on this idea. The concept is that the best chance for success in any endeavor is to put actions behind it.

I used to work in a hospital and needed to clock in at 7am everyday. This ain't no stumble in at 7:16 am with your coffee and bagel, eat at your desk and check your e-mail kinda 7am. This was by 07:00:30 you're already working. Breakfast and coffee? You gotta scarf it down before you clock in. With walking the dog, breakfast and commute I had to be up by 5:15. I am not a 5:15 kinda guy! So I was having a lot of trouble getting up in the morning and was late twice by my second week. People kept saying, ""you need a routine."" Yes that's all good, but how do you actually do this? Todo lists don't mean shit if you aren't going to do them.

One Saturday afternoon I thought ""a decision without action is just a wish."" It's not enough for me to write out a routine when the odds of me getting up are stacked against me anyways. I need to put real action behind this! I can't just get better at waking up, I need to be good at it.

I got in bed and told Siri to wake me up in 5 minutes. I would close my eyes and soon as it wrung I popped out bed and jumped in the shower before the water even warmed up. I rinsed quickly, dried myself off, got back into bed and told Siri to make me up in 5 minutes. I repeated this 13 times! Talk about a wet towel!

Do you think I had trouble getting out of bed from then on? Yea, sure, but it was seldom again the daunting experience it once was. If your problem is throwing your clothes on the floor instead of the hamper, put on some clothes and strip 20 times throwing your clothes in the hamper. If your problem is you don't do your dishes after dinner, guess what my suggestion is.

A ""decision"" is more than just reps. It's setting yourself up for success and the inability to fail. It's keeping an extra set of gym gear in the car in case you forget.

I've always considered ""motivation"" or any kind of desire to do something as something essential when pursuing to do any task. It seems logical that when you have to finish some task you **have to want** to finish it, otherwise it won't be as good, as it would be when you'd do it motivated.

It turns out that it might be the most deceptive belief I've ever had (but it may be not, still researching). Timothy Pychyl, in his book ""The Procrastinator's Digest"" (I highly recommend), points out that it's common for procrastinators to believe that they (well, we) have to be motivated before they start to do the task. We actually think that motivation precedes action, but it's usually the other way around - action induces motivation.

Why do I consider this so important? Because sometimes I, and probably many other procrastinators, wait until the magical ""muse"" shows up and until then I wait, read books on motivation, ""think positively"" and do a lot of other things that aren't even remotely useful because I haven't even started my task, so they're just time placeholders, so I can't tell myself that I'm doing nothing.

So, you don't have to wait until you want to do something - you just have to start and THEN the motivation and willpower will appear. Just open the book, put down your name on that paper, put on your running shoes...

For me it's much easier when I know that I don't have to wait until I want to do it. Maybe you already know it, but I hope it will help someone. :)

Keep a pair of earplugs with you and bring them everywhere. 

For those of you who haven't studied with earplugs, take them to the common room of your school library and plug em' in. You'll be surprised how much... noise is around you, distracting you. The use of earplugs, at least for me- recreates the feeling of being intensely focused, and in flow. 

Flow is a psychological state that is defined as full involvement on a particular task, so much so, that there is no attention left to be given to anything else. [1] Using earplugs (personally) recreates flow and makes it easier to attain. You can not hear other people or things and you won't be distracted by them. You are reducing the attention you would potentially give to listening and conserving it for focusing. (Anecdotal premise)

Keeping earplugs on you at all times transforms a loud subway car, chattery coffee shop, bus stop, all into a silent library. It's really great and I believe it's definitely changed my life. 

Lastly, if you've got earplugs on- your friends or acquaintances will be much less likely to bother you. In fact, no one will bother you. Really, try it. And you don't look like an idiot when you have them on, it's barely noticeable if you're not being paid attention to. 


Try it! **Most universities offer and supply free earplugs at their office of psychological help or mental wellness centers!** (To make sure students can sleep in loud dorms and study when they need to)

If anything I thought of myself as a connoisseur, seeking out the newest and best craft beer or cocktail bar or single malt, or what have you. I drank frequently, but never felt like I was struggling to moderate my drinking, or to avoid getting wasted or hungover without good cause. And when I decided to quit altogether, it wasn't much of a struggle either.

After giving up alcohol, I'm a lot less certain about a lot of things I thought I knew about my drinking and my life. And I've arrived at a couple of conclusions specifically on the relationship of alcohol to self-discipline. This is anecdotal of course, but I'd be more inclined to keep it to myself if I didn't hear the same sentiments echoed throughout the recovery community.

Those conclusions can be boiled down to a pretty simple hunch: if you drink regularly, in any quantity, it's probably undermining your self-discipline. And it's hard to realize just how pervasively, how insidiously, it's working against your goals until you try going without it, at least for a little while.

I don't mean to sound like Carrie Nation's hatchet here, I'm keenly aware of the positive aspects of alcohol: as a highly evolved expression of culture and craftsmanship; as a social lubricant and point of connection between people; as a warming, contemplative comfort after a long day of responsibility. What I do mean to say is, you don't have to be hitting the liquor store three times a day, or spending your weekends in the drunk tank, or puking in the bathroom at work, to at least pose the question of whether your life might be improved by the absence of alcohol. Especially if you're a part of this subreddit, looking to improve your life through conscious effort.

Alcohol is a cheap thrill. This is true as a simple matter of brain chemistry. It hot-wires your brain's reward system and drives off with it. And whereas your brain normally tends to cooperate with self-discipline, saving that precious squirt of dopamine or endorphins or oxytocin for moments of genuine success, or effort, or connection with another human being, alcohol turns that equation on its head. Those positive activities become relatively less rewarding; the carrot at the end of the stick gets smaller.

For me, there was an almost tangible sense of my reserves of willpower replenishing themselves after giving up drinking. I found it easier to exercise self-control, to follow through on commitments, to take possession of my emotional states, in every aspect of my life. I no longer struggled (as much) to not overeat and to exercise. Books and articles I had been meaning to read for months were finished and placed back on the shelf. I felt productive and engaged at work, instead of bored and put-upon. I realized how many relationships I had been neglecting or taking for granted. It was like the volume was suddenly turned back up on the rest of my life.

And that's without even talking about the surge of energy. This is something people talk about a lot in connection with sobriety, having more energy than you know what to do with in the early stages of recovery. Two weeks after giving up drinking, I had so much energy it was hard to sleep. Not that kind of awful, bleary, twitchy insomnia. I wanted to be up and about and getting on with my life and doing things. If I'm being honest, it felt a little like that first hit of cocaine, except this was my body creating that feeling naturally. My days suddenly seemed to have more hours in them. 

And that brings me to my final point. Consider how much time alcohol costs. Consider how long you had to work to make the money you're drinking. Consider the hours, days, months, spent feeling, if not hungover, then just kind of off, sluggish, down. Consider whether the bars and liquor stores you patronize are places you would consider spending a nanosecond if they didn't have alcohol. Consider whether the Good Times you had with your drinking buddies seem nearly as good in retrospect as they did at the time. At best, it's all time not spent working towards your goals.

My point here is not to claim that everyone who drinks is an alcoholic, or will become an alcoholic. That's obviously not true, and many people find it not difficult at all to drink and stay disciplined in pursuit of their goals. But my hope in posting this is that at least a few of those people are inspired to ask the question: might it be easier to live a disciplined life without alcohol? A lot of people are in circumstances and communities that can make it difficult to even formulate the question.

At the very least, consider taking a break from alcohol, if only as an experiment in self-discovery. Do it for a weekend, or for two weeks, or for a month, or whatever makes sense to you. I promise that at least some part of the experience will surprise you. And if it turns out to be harder to give it up than you thought it would be, know that [help](http://aa.org/) is closer than you might think.

**TLDR;** Even if you're not an alcoholic, it's easy for alcohol to undermine your discipline without you realizing it. Consider taking a break, or giving it up for good, to find out whether that's true for you.",,False,,t5_2uzju,1371238167.0,,,True,t3_1gcuh5,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1gcuh5/dont_let_alcohol_get_in_your_way/,

I'm currently a student in my 2nd year of Economics at university. In school I was always amongst the best in my class, but then (in high school), I started working less, getting more and more lazy, not doing my homework etc. 

But when I started university, studying economics, which I love and am really interested in, I got even lazier, especially since I've been living alone. 

My first year went okay though, I passed both my semesters and didn't have big problems understanding the lectures and stuff, so I passed without working super extra hard, except for the finals.
But this year, it's been quite different. I still like what I study, but I just couldn't find enough motivation during the first semester to even attend the lectures, and barely studied for the finals. Result: I failed my first semester.
I now need to get a good average grade on my second one to compensate, but even if I failed my first semester, it seems like it didn't change anything, I still am not motivated, and if I keep on going like this I'll fail the whole year.

Also, the only good friend I made this year in my class is one of the best, he studies every night for a few hours, does his assignments, asks questions, goes further into every chapter, and yet still manages to go out and have fun. And I feel really stupid when sometimes he asks for my help for an assignment or something, and I have no idea what he's talking about because I didn't even open my book. I just don't wanna be the girl who doesn't understand anything, who's gonna fail her year... and I certainly don't wanna ask him for help (because he tends to be slightly patronising sometimes).

I don't know, I just feel like I can't do that, every time I come home I'm distracted by stupid things like cleaning, going on r/funny or Facebook... I used to force myself to go to the library (where I'd do some really good studying) but now I always find reasons not to go...
So here's my question: how can I find the motivation I had before? How do I stop being lazy/procrastinating? 
Thanks :)

(Oh and excuse my mistakes, I'm French!)

TL;DR: was motivated, somehow lost it, need to get my motivation back to pass this year.

They’re at least as powerful as green tea.

This is my story of green tea, the power of healthy habits, and becoming superhuman. 

In 2007 I started working full-time for an education consulting company that was chock-full of caring, emotionally intelligent, mature people who believed in the power of yoga, eating healthy, non-violent communication, &amp; occasionally crystal healing.

It was a wonderful, healing work environment. My job consisted of spending as much of the day as possible on the phone with college students, encouraging them in their studies, asking them how their life could be better, &amp; confronting their limiting beliefs.

All my co-workers were doing the same thing. So it was essentially a boiler room operation, except instead of pushing overpriced stock on unsuspecting rubes with too much liquidity, we were pushing self-improvement on unconfident first-gen college students with too much debt.

One of the many benefits of this job was that it forced me to examine my own life more closely. I had been struggling to get into a meditation practice for years — I knew intellectually that meditation was the right thing to do, but I lacked the willpower. Similarly with going to the gym. Similarly with figuring out a clear spiritual path. Similarly with improving my diet.

I knew all these good things to do: I just lacked the willpower to do them on any sort of regular basis.

Luckily, the job provisioned me — as a condition of my employment — with mentors and supportive colleagues of all kinds. In such a healthy and pro-change environment, it was perhaps inevitable what happened next:

I started drinking green tea.

I started drinking a lot of green tea.

You might think that this would be a totally innocuous life change, and it was . . . at first. But it quickly grew and became something far less innocuous.

The apparent cause of this change was reading a short article that presented evidence that Japanese men who drank 4-6 cups of green tea daily had reduced rates of cancers of all kinds. This isn’t the article in question, but it still collects a solid body of evidence so you can get the idea, and it also features one of the best sentences written about green tea’s effects ever:

When confronted with a cancerous cell, green tea becomes the plant kingdom’s Arnold Schwarzenegger, helping to terminate cancer cells in a remarkable number of ways.

I remember thinking: “Ok, Japanese men who drink 4 – 6 cups of green tea per day cut their chances of getting various cancers from 33% to 75%. That’s probably the best guarantee anyone can give me. I don’t want to get cancer: ergo, I should start drinking 4 -6 cups of green tea per day.”

And so I did.

It was as simple as picking up a $2 box of green tea bags from Trader Joes and double-brewing two tea bags in the morning as soon as I arrived at work, and then two more tea bags after lunch, in a large company-branded 12 oz mug. That had to be the equivalent of at least 4 cups, especially since I left the tea bags steeping until I finished the full 12 oz mug (a practice that many tea connoisseurs would surely frown upon; I, however, grew to love the bitter, acidic, over-steeped taste.)

It was the simplest of habits, anchored to two of the simplest events: arriving at work in the morning, and finishing lunch in the afternoon.

The caffeine gave me a nice, gentle, slow ramp-up lift at both times — especially in the afternoon, when my brain automatically decided it was time for a nap.

This habit, once established, became nearly impossible to break and is still with me to this day (although I have since added a squeeze of lemon, since evidence suggests that ascorbic acid increases the bioavailability of the catechins.) It became my ritual in the same way that some people’s ritual was to hit up Starbucks for a double espresso each morning.

And it changed my life.

First, it improved my work performance, via the aforementioned caffeine lift. Subtle, but important. Secondly, and vastly more important, it demonstrated to me that a healthy life  habit could be put on autopilot — literally, that once this healthy habit was established, it gave me more energy than it took for me to maintain it — i.e., it was now adding more benefit to my life than it cost in terms of time or mental effort.

That one example was all I needed to convince me that I could follow this procedure to turn my entire life around.

If I could become master of my habits, and fill my life with healthy habits that gave me more energy than they required, I could be, in essence, superhuman. I could rise above my own frailties, the ill health and time-wasting blocks to performance that had plagued my life till then.

This idea was, of course, intensely appealing to me.

The rest, as they say, is history: the next habit I adopted was making my daily lunch automatic — I would fix a single healthy meal on Sunday evenings, and divide it up into 5 Tupperware portions. This put my healthy-eating choice on automatic for 33% of the meals I would eat during the week — and from there, it wasn’t  hard to automate my breakfast and, to a lesser degree, dinner. (For years, it was quinoa, bell peppers, organic spinach, and grass-fed buffalo meat for lunch, 5 days a week, 4 weeks a month, 12 months a year.)

Next up was meditation.  After struggling for the previous 5 years, I opened the year 2012 with a solid 30 minute morning-and-evening practice that lengthened by the end of the year to a 1-hour morning-and-evening practice. My meditation practice improvement coincided with getting serious about my spiritual path, and in addition to sitting, I opened each day with study of various wisdom texts. The year 2012 included a 10-day Goenka Vipassana meditation retreat and the stunning and reassuring realization that an infinite wellspring of creativity was waiting for me in the silence of meditation. This is the reason I recommend meditation so strongly to everyone, and especially to creative people: you lose all your anxiety about “production” of your art when you realize you can always “go to the Well” to get more inspiration &amp; guidance.

Next I automated my gym attendance, by tacking it on to my morning routine, just before meditation. I found my meditation practice concentration improving when my body was thoroughly worn out and “woken up” by a good 30 minutes of weights or cardio. I flirted with yoga and discovered the power of the yoga + meditation combination. To this day, some of the deepest peace I have experienced mentally has come after this double-hit.

The magic of these habits is that they become automatic, and ushered in a whole cascade of beneficial side-effects. Whatever the weather, I was rising at 530 and hitting the gym by 540am: combined this early workout with meditation and not having to fix a lunch for myself every day gave me such a good start to my day that I was arriving at the office a minimum of a half-hour early — and often a full hour early before the work day started.

This additional time “at work” when no one else was around allowed me to absolutely crush my targets and goals, and enjoy myself while doing it much more, as well.The five promotions &amp; raises I achieved in five years suggests that this contributed to my overall success.

Understanding how to hack healthy habits into my life literally turned me from an average, frustrated, struggling &amp; stuck line employee into an exceptional contributor to a corporate culture that profited greatly from my efforts, while bringing me into a life of deeper peace, serenity, and calm as a benefit.

It was this foundation of healthy habits that gave me the base from which to leave this same company at which I had learned so much in 2012, and pursue the journey you are now taking part in by reading this entry.

So, don’t under-estimate the power of green tea: or any other small, repeated action that gives you more energy than it requires at first, or eventually. Consider these the best investments you will ever make in yourself.

Take healthy eating, for example: by avoiding processed, hormone-laced industrial or synthetic food and instead choosing fresh fruits &amp; vegetables from your local farmer, you are spending more money up front, but almost certainly reducing your health care costs into the indefinite future — as well as getting the up-front benefit of better health, better energy, healthier teeth, more stable moods, &amp; etc.  Up front investment, more than repaid down the line.

If you want to be a superhuman, take green tea, or whatever healthy habit makes sense to you.

Start small. Anchor your new habit to an existing habit (like getting up in the morning). Repeat it until it is automatic. Then add something else.

It only takes one to start.

Then, after the time goes by, I set another one for 2 minutes and go do something else for that time. And then just repeat. (actually, I make an interval timer so I don't have to set alarm all the time). 

Over the last few years I've always read about taking breaks and their impact on productivity, but in every article/book on this topic I've found numbers like 40/20min, 25/5min, 50,10min etc. and since I have big problems with hyperactivity (~ADHD), I would struggle to focus myself for 20 or more minutes. And that's why this works so well for me. Short bursts of work, small rest, and again. 10 minutes pass very quickly and they build up really quickly. 

PS. When taking a break, don't use the internet because you'll get carried away. Do something else (pen spinning/juggling works for me)

EDITING so I don't get deleted. Here's the gist of the post:

&gt;**Forget logic.** Once you've decided to do something, logic and rationale won't help you. Your inner reptile can be placated, scared and excited. But it doesn't speak with language and cannot be reasoned with.

&gt;**Comfort matters**. If you're hungry, tired or depressed your baby reptile will rebel. Fail to take care of yourself, and he'll wail and scream and refuse to do a damn thing you say. That's what he's for. Eat, sleep and make time for fun.

&gt;**Nurture discipline.** Build a routine of positive and negative reinforcement. If you want a child to eat their vegetables, don't give them dessert first. Reward yourself for successes, and set up assured punishments for your failure. Classic examples include committing to a public goal, or working in a team - social pressure can influence Rex.  

&gt;**Incite emotion.** Your reptile brain responds to emotion. That is its language. So get yourself pumped, or terrified. Motivational talks, movies and articles can work, for a while. I use dramatic music (one of my favourite playlists is called Music to conquer worlds by). Picture the bliss associated with getting something done, or the horrors of failing. Make your imagination vivid enough that it shakes you. We use similar tricks on children for a reason: ""brush your teeth or they'll fall out"".

&gt;**Force a start.** The most important thing you can do is start. Much of Rex's instincts are to avoid change, and once you begin something those instincts start to tip into your favour. With enough time, you can even convince Rex to love doing the things he hated. There's a reason we force kids to go to school or to try piano lessons.

&gt;**Bias your environment.** Rex is short sighted and not terribly bright. If he sees a Facebook icon, he'll want it. It's like showing a child the start of a cool TV program immediately before bedtime. Design your environment to be free from such distractions: sign out of instant messenger, turn off notifications, turn off email. Have separate places for work and fun, and ideally separate computers (or at least accounts).

&gt;Once you know what to look for, you'll start to recognise the patterns and control them.

&gt;**There's an impulsive baby reptile in your brain, and unfortunately he has the steering wheel. If you can be a good parent to him he'll mostly do what you say, and serve you well.

The experience deeply affected him of course, and it pops up a lot in his writings. 

One thing he wrote which intrigued me was of how a condemned man is haunted by ideas of what amazing things he could accomplish with the rest of his life, and how much of it he has wasted. We're all familiar with ""memento mori"" but Dostoevsky actually knew what it's like to know you are about to die, and reading about it gives me the creeps. A condemned man, he says, promises himself that if by some miracle he escapes, every minute of the rest of his life would be used to its utmost potential.

Dostoevsky did escape by a miracle, and went off to destroy two marriages and develop a crippling gambling addiction, getting drunk whenever he wasn't writing. It is impossible, Dostoevsky later wrote, for a man to make the most of every moment. Every work day must include laziness, every project, procrastination. He should know, right?

With respect to a man who spent a decade in a Siberian labor camp, I'd like to challenge this. Just until Friday. I will see if it's possible to make the most I possibly can of each day. I will take rests, but only rests [which I have earned](http://www.quotesvalley.com/images/08/no-rest-is-worth-anything-except-the-rest-that-is-earned.jpg). And these breaks won't be a waste of time; under no circumstances will I visit reddit or watch TV. I'll use the time to write to my mother, skype my girlfriend, or read.

Tl;dr, is it possible to stick to the below schedule every day for a week?

7:00 - Wake

7:05 - Go for a run

7:30 - Shower

7:45 - Put pen to paper and write for half an hour about anything that comes to mind. Throw paper away when 30 minutes are up.

8:15 - Large breakfast

8:45 - 1 hour of academic reading. Do not open computer.

9:45 - For 15 minutes, write down any original thoughts related to what I've just read. Save these.

10:00 - Upper-body weight training, depending on what muscles I trained the previous day

10:30 - Get ass outside into nature. I have a list of projects to work on outdoors, including learning to make a fire with a flint striker, harvesting pine sap, carving a wooden spoon

12:00 - Academic reading for 1/2 hour before lunch

1:00 - Chat/skype with distance girlfriend if she's available. Otherwise do something else relaxing but productive, and do not open computer

2:00 - Go to study room with pile of books and do some serious academic writing. Draft essays, notes for talking in class, etc.

4:00 - 1 hour devoted to keeping in touch with family

5:00 - Knit or crochet for 1 hour

6:00 - Dinner

6:45 - 75 minutes of academic work, to make daily total 5 hours. Do not open computer

8:00 - Not every day will be the same, so 1 hour devoted to tying up loose ends on any project of my choosing

9:00 - Read for pleasure

10:00 - I'm expanding my mind into the realm of hip-hop music. Lie in bed and listen to rap; don't multitask

10:30 - Bedtime, no excuses. This'll be the hard part.

I'll come back to update on Wednesday and Friday. I don't expect my experience will be very interesting, but in all honesty I'm one of the most hopeless basement-dwelling fuckups ever to find inspiration in this subreddit.

And if we accept that as true, we can extrapolate that with each decision we make, we implicitly make future decisions as well. 

For example, if/when you sit down to watch TV when you feel a little tired, you must (after reading this) recognize you will make that decision again. I personally would expect a person to make this choice many more times -- to pick a clear number, let's use the number 100. When you sit down to watch TV, you must recognize that your choice affects not just now, but 100 future choices as well.

Remembering this could help tremendously. First, it helps us look at the consequences. Do you want to sit down and watch TV 100 times? Do you want to watch 100 hours of TV? What if you chose instead, 100 times, to read a book, exercise, draw, program, study for an hour? If you only look at once instance of TV watching, you can shrug it off, but if you keep in mind that we have a larger life pattern, that won't work. 

Second, if you think in terms of 100 choices rather than one, you can figure in the probability of the situation. Not every time you read a book, exercise, draw, program, study will result in a huge success. Sometimes you won't make a lot of progress. In general, though, you can figure that you will make an ordinary amount of progress.

My first attempt was when i was a teen, i took 1-2 guitar classes with my neighbor who was an old school classic guitar teacher. Very strict and all about the basics. I really didn't have the motivation to study this way so i dropped.

Later growing up i tried to study again by my self once or twice with cheap classic guitar that i bought and failed to keeping through with it.

I was always kinda bummed out seeing other people playing and wondering how come i never did it, and heard from couple of people that it really ""suits"" me to play some instrument.

8 months ago, I saw my house-mate and good friend has a quite expensive acoustic guitar. I asked if i can burrow it and try to study guitar, he agreed because he was hardly using it anyway.

since that in the last 8 months, i transformed from somebody who doesn't know to play guitar at all, to somebody who already knows how to play most of his favorite songs. I'm not Jimi Hendrix, but i'm a decent camp-fire guitar player.

I wanted to share with you some unconventional (and conventional) wisdom that help me to succeed in my goal. 
1. Remember the story about the chained baby elephant? This story very influenced me in my life. I'm always trying to check my limits.
http://www.acropolis.org.in/articles/142-the-chained-elephant
2. I think the thing really helped me in this situation, and it goes against the conventional wisdom of ""all you need is will power"" is the fact that the guitar i was practicing on had a really good sound. Any guitar player will tell you it's much harder to study guitar on steel string acoustic guitar than on a classic guitar but i was having a lot of fun with the practice because everything sounded so great. I was able to suffer the annoying finger pain because of it too, and the steel strings actually got my fingers more pain resistant faster.
So yeah, in this case the expensive gear made the difference for me.
3. One of the most important things that really helped me was the great study material i had. I started from Marty Schwartz videos on youtube. Until i found this excellent website:
http://www.justinguitar.com/

I know it sounds like a commercial, but this guy is teaching everything for free and basically does his money out of donations only, so i think he deserves some credit. Everything is covered very thoroughly and the lessons have a great way of building your skills from scratch - without the need to use anything else but the material on the site. It really helped me to focus on studying and not just looking for material all the time.

I think that the most important thing that iv'e studied from the experience of learning to play the guitar is that good logistics and studying materials can compensate for a lack of will power to a certain degree.

I'm not sure if this is you or not, but there's been a lot of activity on this subreddit by people who are lamenting about their inability to get and keep their shit together.

I just want to put down a few ideas for you to counterbalance a lot of what you might have been reading. I think you will like them.

Nobody is able to permanently sustain a habit that makes them feel bad. If you find motivation to do something like eat raw broccoli every day for dinner, that's great. But you might find your enthusiasm waning and suddenly you're left with all of your self-worth placed on this promise you made to yourself when you were in a different emotional place.

If doing something makes you miserable, it's probably not going to become a habit.

People are able to pick up and keep ""good"" habits only when it feels good to keep them. The only people who work out every day are the ones who like working out.

Furthermore, it's not your job to control yourself like a circus animal. If you're frustrated with your ability to make yourself do something regularly, it's because it's impossible. You, your body, your life, are all way, way, too big to possibly be controlled.

You can't make yourself do anything. You don't call the shots - your *self* does.

But this is good because you don't need to! Humans are the only thing that try to will-power something into existence. Entire mountains, islands, and planets come into being and nobody needed to cut down on their sodium intake to do it.

Well-being is easy. Life is easy. Success is easy. If you're like me, you overthink the shit out of everything until life is so confusing and complicated that all you can do is crack open a case of beers and forget about it all.

If you really want to influence how things go, try being kinder to yourself! If you're frustrated about your life, or yourself, feeling inferior to all those motivational speakers and /r/getdisciplined OPs who exercise everyday and run five successful businesses simultaneously - then it's likely you're being pretty hard on yourself.

Give yourself a break! Cut yourself some slack. You're good! There's nothing wrong with you. Everything's fine, you're likely just making this all more complicated than it needs to be.

You're doing great! If you're feeling low, it just means you're about to expand into a bigger, better version of yourself. It's all expansion, it's all good. You're smart, talented, and you're damn good looking.

(If you google this area then there are loads of article - I just chose this one!)

I found this very interesting because I have always been able to learn things fairly quickly and coasted on that all the way to university where I was offered a place to study physics at one of the best UK universities.

I really came undone here because I tried to cram a years worth of hard physics courses into a few weeks - and did this every year while telling myself that I would get a better mark next year to make up for this one.  Eventually I graduated with a 2.2 which is a below average degree class in the UK.

What took my so long to realise was that the students were disciplined and consistent with their studies were by far the best, even though they didn't necessarily pick up the material as fast.

The study shows that for academic success there a strong  correlation between having self-discipline and doing well in education, and this is much stronger than for IQ, which is usually misconceived to be the main driving force.

I've started thinking about this and I believe that discipline underpins our success with practically every area of our life and found this to be extremely motivational because of the degree to which we can improve our discipline!

Time to get disciplined.,Logicitus,199,37,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1hmnts/i_received_the_best_bad_news_of_my_life_yesterday/,"So I've just completed my 2nd year of university. After having a pretty horrendous time battling depression, I wasn't surprised to learn yesterday that I failed 8 out of my 11 modules. However, due to my circumstances I've been offered the opportunity to sit another exam for each of those 8 modules in September. The mark from those exams will form my new grade for each module.

Regarding the depression, I'm in a much better place than I was thanks to some small changes I made to my day-to-day life, and some quotes to help me get motivated to things (sometimes even just to get myself out of bed).

Now, I need to carry on progressing while maintaining a disciplined summer program. My 5 goals are as follows:

1.	Study to confidently achieve 70%+ in all 8 exams.
2.	Complete the 200squat &amp; 100pushup programs.
3.	Spend 10hours+ per week on my new job (variable hours)
4.	Quit smoking tobacco (w/ exceptions on nights out drinking. max once per week)
5.	Meditate daily

In order to accomplish this, I'm going to be keeping a journal which I'll write in 3 days a week (I'll post my updates here if anybody is interested). My next step, is to break these 5 goals into sub-goals that I can track on a daily/weekly basis. I have 8 weeks starting from Monday. Let's do this.

UPDATE 1: Okay Reddit; I'm one week in to my summer challenge. I broke down all the modules I'm working on into their individual topics and organised them into a schedule that will allow me to cover all of the material with a two week buffer. This time also includes working on exam style questions throughout my revision; the extra two weeks are incase I fall behind, or to do extra exam questions at the end. So far I am on track, and feel like I have a good understanding of what I've been working on over the past week.

The squat and press-up programs are going well. I have already noticed some slight improvements in my strength. I really look forward to my sessions, as I can really feel the endorphins running through me afterwards. I've know added the crunch and dip programs which I started today.

My new job hasn't been living up to my expectations, and there isn't as much work for me as I thought there was going to be. This isn't my top priority at the moment so I'm not going to spend too much time worrying about that, but I should definitely spend some time considering different ways I can earn money that I can still fit in with my schedule.

I'm now 9 days cigarette free, though I was using an e-cig for the first couple of days to gently ween down the nicotine levels. This has been a lot more successful that I expected, and I'm very proud of what I've achieved here :)

I meditated every weekday last week, but skipped out this weekend. I should probably try to avoid missing out session on weekends; building a habit of meditating after my shower will help with this.

Overall I'm really pleased with how I've been going so far; just looking back at what I've done this past week is making me excited for the week to come.

Don't you think it's enough?

Everyday, a good number of posts here are either people asking about a good app to make themselves disciplined, or commenting that they are making a new app to make themselves disciplined.

Am I the only one who sees something wrong with this?

These ""apps"" are tools, meant to help you out, not magic pills of change that will transform you. So many people here put so much emphasis on apps and other types of ""tools"", seeming to think that the only difference between an disciplined person and an undisciplined one is that the first has a certain app on his/her phone. 

The apps are not even important tools. I know because I've greatly disciplined my life, in relation to what it once was, without the use of apps. Not that I'm in some kind of tech-free high horse, only that my phone is too old to have apps.

The most important thing you need is desire. Desire to become someone better. Desire to structure your life in a way that will fulfill you, and then follow up on that structure. If you have that, hell, the only tool you will need is pen and paper. See the great, disciplined man of ages past. Some didn't have the Internet, access to computers,  some of the greatest didn't even had eletricity.

What I feel from these constant questioning and discussion about apps is that people are simply giving themselves permission to put the responsability in something else, to push away the changes they know they need to do. ""Once I have the perfect app, then I'll start"" or ""I have failed because this app that I've used is bad, I need a new one"".

I lost about fifteen kilograms, I'm stronger, faster, and more energetic, and, most importantly, healthier. There are a few reasons I have succeeded at this, most of which aren't new methods or mindsets to those who seek ways to get disciplined. Sure, I focus on the outcome. I receive positive feedback from my friends. I have incorporated training into my life as a habit. But the following is the main reason that, for the first time in my life, I have been able to stick to such a programme: **I accepted that I hate exercise and that it's okay to hate exercise**. If I were told that I had some disease and that for treatment I would have to go to the hospital three times a week for a lumbar puncture, I would do it. I would hate it. It would be sore and uncomfortable. But I would do it. I would accept that it's going to be sore and uncomfortable but I would still do it. That's how exercise is: like a bloody lumbar puncture.

Before, I would take up a programme. I would exercise. I would hate the exercise. I would feel that it wasn't for me. I would think that if I didn't enjoy it then it wasn't worth doing, or that the discomfort I felt meant that exercise just wasn't for me. Shouldn't I experience a runner's high? Just once? Then, this time round, I realised that I don't need to like it. I shouldn't expect to like it. Not liking exercise doesn't mean that I'm failing at it. It's only for a few hours every week and that's all I have to do. And I don't resent the pain and discomfort I feel while exercising.

Now that it's winter I do my programme in the dark, in the cold, on uneven ground. Pooh-strewn uneven ground. It's not very pleasant. But I do hate it less than when I started. It's definitely not as painful as it was, and sometimes it even feels easy. I still maintain that the runner's high is a myth.

1365440074.0,161,self.getdisciplined,1bxdow,Make good decisions immediate. Make bad decisions delayed.,ThereIsNoJustice,173,12,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1bxdow/make_good_decisions_immediate_make_bad_decisions/,"&gt;I have spoken to distance runners who, as exhaustion approaches, pick their stopping places a mile in advance with the rule that any place more distant can be picked at any time before they reach the current target, and once picked even by the most fleeting resolve it becomes controlling. - Thomas Schelling, the intimate contest for self command

The idea here is simple but works. The good decision, running farther, is made easier and immediate. The unwanted decision, stopping, is put on a delay. So when making said bad decision, the runner will likely realize they can run longer, or see that they made an excuse, or what have you -- however it happens, the person will likely redouble their efforts before stopping, since they have given themselves the time to reflect on their decision. 

The same principle has been used by smokers. They set a rule that they can smoke any time they want, so long as they wait three hours to do so. Knowing they can have a cigarette whenever they want relieves some stress, but having it on a delay allows the person to push themselves if they realize they can go without for longer. 

Something many people might give a shot: you can load any page on reddit, provided you wait ten/twenty/thirty minutes. 

How else could r/getdisciplined apply this idea to your good and bad decisions?

1361753701.0,158,self.getdisciplined,195v6e,How Neuroscience Can Significantly Increase Your Chances of Sticking to Your Plan,Mindful_1,194,36,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/195v6e/how_neuroscience_can_significantly_increase_your/,"As Oliver Emburton indicated in Entrachy's recent Quora post to this subreddit, the basal ganglia are the structures in the brain that determine whether our willpower or our desires win the battle for control over our actions. When we are debating with ourselves over what to do next, the basal ganglia are inhibiting the motor signals associated with each option from reaching the spinal cord and being carried out by the body. It is only when the basal ganglia decide that a particular course of action is best that they stop inhibiting the associated motor signal. Once the selection is made, the motor signals that weren't selected continue to be inhibited until their consideration by the prefrontal cortex ceases. Once consideration by the prefrontal cortex ceases we are no longer indecisive and can carry out the task at hand with greater ease. This is one of the reasons why starting a task is the hardest part.

In their article [""The Role of Basal Ganglia in Habit Formation""](http://people.duke.edu/~hy43/role%20of%20basal.pdf) Yin and Knowlton mention that it is well established that goal-directed behaviors can form habits. They use the example of flipping a light switch because we predict that we will achieve our desire of illuminating the room we are entering. But sometimes we flip the light switch habitually, without anticipating the consequences. Given the role that the basal ganglia play in the selection of which motor program to execute, they are implicated in this process of habituatuation. It appears that repeated selection of a goal-directed motor program by the basal ganglia causes that program to be more easily selected in the future, to the point that the program need not be suggested by the prefrontal cortex, i.e. it requires no volition. For tasks which are especially difficult to perform we experience this process as a reduction in willpower required to begin the task.

This is clearly great news since it means a task which requires significant willpower, like choosing to wake up early to workout, will become easier as we repeat the associated motor program--perhaps to the point of virtual automaticity. But how do we find the willpower to choose to perform the task before significant habituation takes place? To answer this question I suggest we draw on insights from a video on Youtube entitled [""The Scientific Power of Thought""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-v-IMSKOtoE).

The key insight from the video is that by merely thinking about actions  we are able to strengthen the associated neural pathways from their beginnings in the prefrontal cortex all the way to their destination in the peripheral nervous system. If this is true for motor programs like playing piano and finger exercises, then why not getting out of bed in the morning, or going to the gym, or sitting down to study? In the same way that actually triggering the selection of a motor program in the basal ganglia and performing a particular behavior causes neural pathways to be strengthened, I posit that merely thinking about performing the behavior has the same effect, (albeit to a lesser degree as the video indicated) ultimately reducing the willpower necessary to perform the behavior.

When we make a plan for what we would like to accomplish in a certain period of time and think through it in order to make it easier to stick to, I suggest that we envision carrying out the plan as vividy as possible in order to trigger neural pathways as strongly and accurately as possible. If the plan entails tasks around the house you may even do a walk through to maximize neural activity. If completing a homework assignment is your targeted action, don't just think ""Next I will sit down at my desk and work on my homework"", instead think ""Next I will sit down at my desk and work on chapter 5, numbers 1-20. For each problem I'll try to solve it the best I can, then go back through the chapter and look at examples to see if I was right. If I'm not I'll try to see what I did wrong and fix it before moving on to the next problem."" Vividly visualize walking through the entire plan a few times to increase habituation, the more the better obviously and presumably there will be diminishing returns with each repetition.

I'd like to add two more tid bits of information that I think are useful. First, don't be too hard on yourself by planning on conquering the world in one day. In their book ""Switch: How to Change Things When Change is Hard"" Chip and Dan Heath cite a study that shows that willpower is an exhaustible resource so there will come a point when your basal ganglia will inhibit the motor program you are carrying out and instead allow a more pleasurable motor program access to the spinal cord (pages 9-10, you can read them for free on amazon.com). Second, there are a couple of good apps you can use to track progress when trying to acquire daily habits: ""Habit Streak"" for android and ""Chains"" for iphone. You enter tasks then they track how many days in a row you've completed the task to form a streak/chain. They help by allowing you to compete with yourself to beat your all-time best and by accumulating pressure not to break the chain as it grows and you don't want to throw away your achievement.

That's it on my big ass post, my willpower has decreased significantly as I wrote it. There's nothing left to do now but make a plan and get those neural pathways firing!

Edit: One more thing, I recommend spacing out your mental walkthroughs in order to maximize the effect. This is a form of learning and we learn better with shorter, more focused sessions than with one long session

It is about changing your mentality and ultimately changing who you are.


What I mean by this is let’s say your name is Bob. Right now you are Bob who wants to get in shape, Bob who wants to graduate college, or Bob who wants to get a promotion.


To become Bob who is in shape, Bob who graduated, or Bob who got promoted, you need to change how you frame the world around you. 

**Instead of Bob who ""wants"" you need to become Bob who ""does.”** 

You need to become Bob who goes to the gym 3 times a week, Bob who goes to every class and does his homework, or Bob who goes the extra mile at work.


As you begin to become Bob who ""does"", at first it will require discipline to go to the gym, make it to every class, or come to work a half hour early. However, as time goes on the actions that you do begin to become habits, you move from Bob who wants to Bob who does.

1360246531.0,150,self.getdisciplined,182cc7,Why You're Probably Going to Fail (and What to Do About it),zenmonkey87,183,33,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/182cc7/why_youre_probably_going_to_fail_and_what_to_do/,"Your discipline is going to fail if your purpose is to eject out of your own life.

This post is a follow up to my previous one in order to be more clear and more practical.

You need to step back and look at the bigger picture. Look at the cycle in its entirety. You look at some element in your life (your money, your body, your grades, etc) and think “I don’t like this shit, this shit needs to change now.” And then you come up with a plan to make it go away. Because you can’t do it in a day, you commit to establishing a habit.

Next, you launch headlong into your new rituals. The first few times you do it excellently, then you maintain it for a little while, before finally slipping up once. When you do, you promise you’ll make it up tomorrow. You do or you don’t. Either way, the slip ups increase in frequency until the whole project withers and dies. And then a moment comes where you realize what has happened.

You slam yourself back in the other direction, eating terribly, slacking, sleeping in, etc. Then that dies down and everything returns to how it was before you started. It stays that what until you begin again.

This is a periodical cycle that we’re all involved in. All of us are at one point or another in this process regarding some aspect of our lives.

**TL;DR: We constantly (valiantly) begin habits that fail.**

This happens again and again and again. What makes some habits stick and not others? What’s the deciding factor?

For one, it’s not will power. It’s also not your character, your personal strength, your dedication, or your heritage.

It’s your degree of acceptance. Acceptance is what makes it or breaks it.

Suppose you’re a smoker. You read about all the terrible things it does to you and you become afraid. You get on yourself to quit. You come up with a plan, commit, and then break the commitment, just like you did ten times before.

You are afraid. You are looking at your current situation, you say “Fuck this!” and you start pressing against it.

Whatever you press against will press back. When you press hard, it presses back just as hard.

Say you’re way too fat right now. You look at yourself in the mirror and say “No.” Right now, you are fat, and you are saying NO to it. In this moment you just introduced friction. You’re pressing against. Left hand pushing against right hand. Me verses fat.

Now all of your admirable effort is expended as wasted energy. It’s just friction. You push and push against your fat, and then once you’re winded, it pushes you right back. It doesn’t matter how much headway you make, how long you’ve been doing it, how much success you’ve attained. It’s all going to come crashing down eventually.


**TL;DR: If you begin by rejecting things the way they are, you are divided. It’s you vs. bad habit. Your energy is wasted in friction. You cannot win when you divide yourself into halves and have them oppose each other.**

Now here’s the ugly part that 9 in 10 people who read this will reject.

If you want to create lasting change, you have no higher priority than removing your friction. You must move into acceptance: You must accept things the way they are. You must say ‘yes’.

Any action born of rejection will bear no desirable fruit.

Instead, can you look at your situation and say, “It is how it is. I accept it.”?  Or even: “If it stayed like this forever, I could still find a way to be happy.”? 

If you try those phrases out, you may notice a huge surge of “NO!!!” happen inside of you. Pay attention to that “No” – it’s the culprit. That “No” is you trying to push you out of your own life. It won’t work.

Instead, can you make friends with the situation, and speak about it (or even to it) affectionately? Can you give it some room to breathe, and enough time to take care of itself?

Because if you can, then you will find yourself on the road to recovery for the first time. If you can welcome the situation into your life, then you’re finally giving the situation a chance to heal itself. You can still do things and discipline yourself, but now your actions will come from a new place. There will be no desperation behind it. It will be much more productive and sustainable.

If you can truly accept everything as it is, everything, including the really shitty parts, then, really, the problem will take care of itself.

**TL;DR: Acceptance is the missing element in all failed attempts at discipline. You will not attain your desires by rejecting your present moment. If you can chill out, accept things as they are (even the ugly bits) then you’ll find your effectiveness will sky-rocket.**

People tell me I am a good musician and I have great potential, but I don't get any better because I'm scared of trying too hard at it. There are so many hobbies I might have, like music, film, art, writing, programming, getting in shape, etc... but I just don't push any further than what I can realistically write off as ""just goofing around"". As long as I can say that I'm not taking it seriously, or I'm just playing with toys, or there's no accountability, I'm fine.

For example, a new friend (I don't have much of those, because I'm afraid to fail there too) said I was good on the synth and invited me to join his jam band. It sounds so fun, but I'm terrified. I'm totally cool with playing it for fun when it's just my drunk roommates listening, but to go to a setting where there is a reasonable expectation of talent, it's scary. I don't want to go and not sound any good. 

I know all the adages: You'll never know if you never try, etc etc etc.

They don't do anything about the wall in my head.

I just mess around with things like music or filming or designing as long as it's just me. As soon as someone says it's good, I feel that there is an expectation for it to be good, and I freeze up, give up, and move on. Thus, I never get good at anything. I feel emotionally drained constantly, and while I appear extremely extroverted to everyone else, maintaining social interaction at work and school and completing my school work without having a breakdown leaves me exhausted... and I feel like I have no time or energy for anything else. Everything requires so much emotional energy just to get past the wall in my head.

I HAVE come a long way from where I was. I spent my first 3 years of college registering for classes, going to the first 3 sessions, and then having a breakdown about the pressure. I would sit in my room for the next 5 months, fail classes, take out more loans, and do it all over again. It was so horrible. 

I am now able to function normally in social situations and maintain a successful and demanding part time job and good grades. Everything past that seems so out of reach, yet I know I have the potential.  I don't want to just take baby steps, and be ready for life when I'm 60. That's the story of my life. I have been socially stunted since I can remember. I wasn't ready for middle school until I entered high school. I wasn't able to excel in a high school setting until my very last year. I wasn't able to really feel comfortable in college until this past year... and all I can do are just work and school. 

I want so badly to be able to do normal things. I see everyone else going to the gym, attending 3 extra-curriculars, going out with friends at night, pursuing hobbies and passions, getting decent grades and earning money too. It's such an emotional feat for me to go to work and class that I can't do anything else.

A lot of this is due to some hardcore childhood PTSD I was diagnosed with, thanks to my stepdad.

Thanks to various subreddits, I am finally ready to start managing my life in a positive way. Having ADHD is largely considered a curse, but I find it to be the greatest gift I have. I can process mass amounts of information when others get overwhelmed. I can get an intense ""mental tunnel-vision"" that allows me to pour a lot more of myself into whatever it is I'm focusing on. The problem is, I spend all my time on stupid crap instead of what I need to be doing. I'm currently unmedicated, and I don't think I will see that changing any time soon. So, here's some things I am doing, and wanted to share.

* I am keeping my notes together with [Evernote](http://evernote.com/). I have the app on my desktop and the mobile app on my phone. This lets me organize all of my notes and keep them in one place. My mind wanders all the time, and jotting down ideas, thoughts, and reminders is important. This allows me to consolidate everything into one place.

* I am using [Astrid](http://astrid.com/) for task management. I can assign specific dates/times for when tasks need to be done, and the mobile app gives me a notification of when I need to perform these actions.

* My number one cause for distraction is Reddit, followed by Facebook. I am so addicted, I will close tabs for Reddit and Facebook, only to open the sites back up out of habit. I can't keep doing this, so I know use the [StayFocused](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji) extention to limit Reddit and Facebook usage to only 2.5 hours a day total for weekdays. I have the option enabled to where even links from both sites will count towards my total time. This may not sound like a sacrifice, but I literally spent 5 hours on reddit today alone. Such a waste of time.
* I am using the [Work Timer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.pdouglas.revisiondroid&amp;hl=en) app to reward myself for the time I've stayed focused. You give yourself a work-to-play time ratio so that for the amount of time you spend focused on work, there is an equivalent amount of time for free time according to the ratio you configure.
* To keep myself honest, I am going to limit my smartphone usage at the house, so that I'm not cheating by using the mobile apps for Reddit and Facebook. To help stay in touch with everyone, I am using [DeskSMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.desktopsms&amp;hl=en) which syncs the messenger app to their cloud service so that I can send/receive SMS messages within my browser.

1369663758.0,146,self.getdisciplined,1f4yam,Slow and Steady wins the race: How to use SMART goals to become more disciplined,bitsnbobs,174,28,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1f4yam/slow_and_steady_wins_the_race_how_to_use_smart/,"**TL;DR:**  It is easy to be impatient and want to achieve a goal rapidly but this requires setting large ambitious targets which require unsustainable amounts of willpower to meet.  In the long run it is much more important to be patient and set achievable targets which you consistently meet and allow you to habitualise certain actions.  There is a system of setting these goals called SMART (one explanation http://topachievement.com/smart.html) which outlines the how to set effective goals.  Aesop's fable about the tortoise and hare is what all of us should be aiming for!  I'm glad they teach that in school but I wish I had truly realised what it meant...be patient and play the long game.  I realise all of this might be obvious to you guys but then again maybe it isn't because it wasn't to me - I kept failing because my targets were too big.  Keep shrinking your targets into you have a 100% sucesss rate - then gradually build them up.  Good luck!

 
**My story:**


It is becoming common knowledge now (at least on here!) that your willpower at a particular point in time is a finite resource, and exercising self-control uses up this resource.  Setting goals which require a lot of willpower is highly risky because there will be days when you are left drained of willpower and knowing that a task requires a lot of willpower to complete with lead to avoid even starting it.
From my experience slow and steady wins every time.  I posted a while ago about my experiences in academia (http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/11ial7/selfdiscipline_matters_more_than_iq_for_academic/)and how the people who got the top marks every time were the people who were the most consistent with working.

A while ago I set two goals – one was to learn the 3000 most commonly used Spanish words and the other was to get fit and lose 20 lbs.  I have been tracking my weight using an app called libra which plots a trend line of your measurements and calculates stats about past and predicted weight loss.  By the way I would really recommend using an app if you are losing weight because it allows you to make so good inferences about what walks and what doesn’t.  My graph shows that I lost a lot during some small periods but for the most part I just stayed constant.  The trouble was that I was setting goals of losing 2-3 lbs a week but that over time this required too much discipline and eventually I would burn out.  Even though I was happy with my weight loss  Libra told me I had only averaged 0.5 lbs a week over the whole time.  I realised that if I had just made a simple commitment of losing 1lb a week I would have doubled my weight loss theoretically by now.  1 lb a week is a fairly easy target and would only require me to create a deficit of 500 cals a day which could be done by reducing 250 from diet and the rest with a relaxing walk in the evening for an hour – hardly a large commitment!  I’ve been doing this for a few weeks no and I’ve lost 4 lbs which might not seem a lot but it required basically no effort at all – just a simple habit.

The other goal I faced a similar problem.  Spanish is very similar to English and I found that I could learn about 100 new words a day, but along with reviewing old words this would take over an hour a day which is a long time to concentrate.  I liked the idea of being able to learn all those words in a month, but I burnt out after a week.  I had very good recall of the words but I couldn’t summon the strength to keep doing it.  I would put off learning for ages because I couldn’t face the mental exertion of studying it.  On the other hand if I had made a simple target of 25 words I could have managed this no problem and would have definitely kept it up for 4 times longer because it required very little effort.  I have been doing that now and, like with the weight loss, even though I’m making slower progress it requires very little effort and has become a habit for me now just to get up and learn those words.

The basic principle behind all of this is how you set your goals and there is a well known system behind successful goal setting called SMART:  Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound.  By making your goals achievable the compound effect will be much greater because you won’t burn out.  Furthermore, research has shown that since habits are executed on autopilot they don’t require self-control, and since SMART targets are easier to meet they become habitualised easier, leaving willpower left over for you to allocate to forming new habits!",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1f4yam,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1f4yam/slow_and_steady_wins_the_race_how_to_use_smart/,
1370787101.0,142,self.getdisciplined,1fzc4o,My discipline tips and tricks.,rawrtwenty2,173,31,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1fzc4o/my_discipline_tips_and_tricks/,"**Tracker**

The first thing I did was create a simple spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel.  The A column contains all the dates for the next three months.  The B column starts the header for the goals, going from B1 through the 1st row.  In each corresponding category, for example, A2 is ""6/9/13"" and B1 is ""Yoga,"" I put an ""X"" into the blank B2 cell.  Advanced:  I froze row 1 so that I could always see the header.  I also did some more fun formatting with colors and stuff.

**Time**

I have no specific time of day to do the daily goals listed in row A because I have a very open schedule, but I suggest being creative with the formatting.  An example is that I have a blank column after my daily goals where the header says ""Weekly"" or ""Monthly"" and the column headers to the left were the titles of the goals.  This way I can mark it on the specific day I completed it.

**Just Do It**

I really hate to be boring, but this is the ultimate motivation for me.  The other lesson of motivation I turn to is *why* I am completing this goal or doing it daily.  A personal example is ""why am I trying to do yoga once a day?"" and my response is ""to be more flexible, to help wake me up, to stretch out my body, to take my time in the morning"" and so on.

**Enlightenment**

I am trying to learn not to move towards goals, but instead to look back at my lovely Excel document to see how the past creates who I am today.  And who I am today, right now, is a lot more important than the past or future.  Brad Warner talks about this in his book Hardcore Zen and I studied a little bit of it in a philosophy class.  The lesson is that the past creates who you are now, and the future is created by who you are now.  Therefore, by enjoying and focusing on the present is a state of enlightenment.  Well, maybe that's not exact, but that is my interpretation of it.  So please be here, now.

**Honesty**

I like to be an honest person and I do hope everyone wants to be honest as well.  Something that is core to trying to be an honest person is being honest with myself.  I don't think there is any better way of knowing that you have a good relationship with yourself without honesty.  If I eat two skittles, I log them in that Excel sheet or on whatever calorie counter I am using and I also log that I have started a ""sugar day.""  If I do yoga for 13 minutes and feel tempted to log 15 minutes, I stop myself and ask, ""what am I gaining from lying?""  In reality, I am gaining an unhealthy habit.  So I stop.

**Injury**

I have been trying to work through some of my goals with a lower back muscle pulled.  It does hurt, and I stop when it hurts.  If I honestly cannot complete a task because of it, I stop and tell myself I will try again later.  I like to do a specific yoga routine over at least a few weeks, but with this strain I had to sit in childs pose and stretch a little that way.  I did hate being immobile but if I tried to push it I would just hurt myself more.  Another motivation is that if I cannot do one task, why not do a little more of another?  Reading the books that sit on my shelf due to school, or my reading-intense English major, is one of my summer goals.  I can just pick up and read double or triple my daily goal on a day I cannot workout or do not have access to the tools I need for another goal.

**Travel, Vacation, Break Time**

One reason for a break from goals is injury.  I didn't worry about my goals while I had this back muscle injury and I realize it is stupid to worry about my goals through any health issue that comes up.  I would say that this includes the passing of loved ones and your mourning, although I highly suggest to maintain some type of relaxed routine to maintain mental health.  For voluntary travel and vacation, I will not be able to do everything I want or I might be on a different schedule than normal.  I keep thinking that I need to be flexible in times like that, but still strive to do what I can.  If I think an off schedule is going to really throw off my groove, I try really hard to keep going with the goal in some way.  But I really don't want to worry about changing things for a little while unless it might screw with my motivation to complete goals.

**Lead to Happiness**

If a goal doesn't lead me to happiness, then why pursue it?  One of the biggest insecurities we have is to compare ourselves to other people.  This is good in moderation.  I know that I should keep my weight loss goals a little more hush-hush around my family and such because I am already a rather slender gal.  My purpose and path to physical happiness is to gain diet and exercise motivation that will last the rest of my life as well as maintaining a weight where I do not have to buy new clothes.  I'm a poor college student and I like to live frugal and minimal, so avoiding shopping for a whole new wardrobe is ideal.  My weight has slowly been climbing over the past year and I realize now that I have to do something instead of continuing to watch it climb.

**""The secrets to life are hidden behind the word cliché.**

*  *Now* is the time.
*  Today is the first day of the rest of my life.
*  Happiness is a choice.

However last night I finally understood what real motivation is.

A close cousin of mine who's my best friend, revealed to me that he's going to be a father. Obviously this is big news. I'm going to be a real uncle in about 8 months. 

I then realised a.) my problems aren't that big b.) I'm not just here and working for my own self satisfaction. There are larger things at stake. I don't want to be the uncle who's completely wasted his life and can't be an inspiration to the kid.

This isn't an ever burning fire of motivation, but rather a realisation. A constant reminder that I'm not just on this Earth to work for myself, but to provide value to others. I got future generations counting on me.

I love this [video of Kobe Bryant when he was interviewed after game two of the NBA finals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBka7fv5PS4).
Watch the end of the video--that's honestly the most important part. Say what you want about the past actions of Kobe Bryant, but the small bit at the end of the interview is an incredible example of how discipline can work. This is the mentality it takes to win a championship in his mind. 

In order to win the championship, even if things are going well, one must recognize that the **job is not finished**. 

Some people would be satisfied with a huge head start. But, true discipline will remind us that your goal does not stop until you finally complete it, no matter how far up or down you are. 

I think I can apply this personally to my own life. 
I am taking a year off of school to prepare applying to medical school and gain some future experiences. Every action that I complete may help me, but my job is not finished until I gain acceptance into the school of my choice.

I have tried everything from banning websites (using software, router settings or hosts file), to turning off the router completely, to literally breaking the router as well. I just can't stop. I've been using the internet on an average of 5 hours a day, on weekends it can go up to 6-14 hours a day. Time just flies. It's become so habitual and ingrained in my mind that I literally cannot stop going on, and when I try to not go on, the temptation becomes so strong that I will find anyway possible to be connected. I'm in need of help. This is my 3rd week of university, and I'm already falling behind because of this addiction. It has cost me my relationship with my family, especially my siblings, made me develop social anxiety, it is one of the contributing factors to my depression, and it has made me develop extreme myopia (I went from having 20/20 vision when I was 12 to be being unable to see anything without glasses; my lenses are extremely thick now)

It started from playing online games, to watching YouTube videos, to socializing, and now it's become my whole life. I do everything on the internet and simply never turn it off. Everything revolves around the internet for me. I believe this addiction is ruining my life. I have tried so many things to quit, but I simply don't have the discipline to quit. Literally for the past 6-9 months of my life, I have thought about quitting 3-4 times a week, but I never have.

I've been trying to abstain from using the computer/internet altogether, but I can't get away from it, since all the lecture slides/textbook PDFs that I need are there, so I can't do my studying without it, and therefore I become too tempted to surf or do something else. I just want to be able to overcome the addiction completely, and then be able to start using the computer/internet moderately and with control. 

This is one of the hardest obstacles that I have ever tried to overcome in my life, it is literally like battling drug addiction for me.

I am here because I have no where else to go. I have tried everything, I need to get rid of this addiction right now!

I'm currently on summer holiday from my degree in Philosophy. Though I often leave things until too close to the deadline and am rarely convinced that the work I hand in is my very best, I am doing quite well in my degree. Similarly I did well at school, but this is work that I feel sure I must get done so I eventually get around to doing it.


However my problem is that I never do anything productive in my free time (aside from the gym). I think many people in this subreddit will identify with this problem. Prescribed work, though boring, eventually gets done. My problem is that I'd like to be the sort of person who writes, draws, and learns about physics in his free-time and at the moment I'm not.

This problem I think comes for two reasons and I hope my identifying what they are will help people offering advice and help people recognise these problems in themselves:


* Fear of failure: this is my biggest problem and it's kind of depressing. I've realised the reason I don't write the screenplay I've been putting off is because I'm terrified it won't be very good. Like a lot of people on reddit I like to think I'm pretty smart. I like to think if I wrote that screenplay it would be pretty damn good. But if I try to sit down to do it, I get very uncomfortable when great ideas don't come immediately and stop. This problem haunts me in so many areas of my life and I'd like some help. In some ways I'm much more comfortable doing nothing and happily pretending I'm a hidden genius.

* The other problem is, I don't know exactly what I want to do. There are alot of projects I want to start. I really envy a friend I have whose sole passion is music. He knows that every moment of free time he has can be spent practicing or composing. I don't have that one passion. I don't have that one fiery passion, I have many vague interests; none of which I pursue wholeheartedly for fear of picking the wrong one.

I got up every morning at 7:15 and got to work at 8:30. I worked until 5:30 Monday through Friday in a cubicle. I did not enjoy my work. I found it intellectually dulling. I'm a pretty frugal person and I've been able to pay my debts and save money so that I could live for about a year without needing to work. So, I quit my job. I want to become a writer. I want to spend the majority of my time during the next year improving my writing. I'm pretty critical about what I consider to be high quality writing and I hold my own writing to this standard. Because of this, I see that it will take me a long time and a lot of effort to write like I want to. OK, so I still wake up every morning at 7:15. I've started to run. I've quit smoking. I no longer buy alcohol, so, I no longer get drunk, even on the weekends. I'm becoming the person I thought I wanted to be, a person who will be happy.


The problem: I find it incredibly difficult to work on my writing. I know my writing sucks, that's why I need to spend all this time improving on it. I often don't spend as much time every day working as I'd like. I feel bad about this. I waste time. I feel uninspired. The biggest problem, the biggest source of demotivation, stagnation, and pain for me are questions about meaning in my life. I ask myself, why am I doing this? I ask, what is the purpose of my life? We will all die eventually, why does it matter what I do? Do I feel better when I don't smoke or drink and run instead? Yes, I do. But, do I feel happier, does my life have more purpose? No, it doesn't. Whenever I write something and I feel good about it, whenever I feel like I've made some sort of progress, the feeling of achievement is instantly taken away from me by the realization of my own mortality.

One thing I do often is set a timer to limit a computer session but sometimes I add more time after it goes off or I just plain have to many sessions in a day.  Last year I quit smoking and this year I have been having great success at getting the weight off I gained after quitting so I know I can make challenging changes when I muster the discipline.  

I just finished labeling a gift box I had kicking around.  The plan is to unhook the computer mouse each morning, put it in the box and put the box on a high shelf in the kitchen so that computer sessions are more of a conscious choice.

The label reads:

Stop!
*Have you done an activity with (my son's name) in the last hour?
*Have you washed all the dishes?
*Is the house reasonably picked up?
*Have you gotten dressed?
*Have you done your work out?
Yes?  Then go ahead BUT set the timer for 20 minutes!

So you're sitting at your computer, trying to think of a practical way to use the time you have. You want to be efficient, but don't know how. Take a few seconds and think of something useful to do. Does anything come to mind? No? Get out of that chair and do push-ups (working out never hurt anyone). Keep going until you can't do anymore. Think again. Any ideas? Nothing still? Beat your face. Repeat.  Got an idea? Now fucking do it. No excuses, no bullshit, get up and do it until it's done. Then find something else to do. Those push-ups will provide some inspiration if you find yourself without an idea again.

Initially I thought this was simply a motivational technique, but I've noticed long term changes in my behavior from doing this.

- If possible, schedule your classes with 1-2 hour breaks in between them. It's not really enough time to go back to your room/drive home and it's a great opportunity to review and expand upon what you've just learned in your previous class.

- Wake up early and get to campus as soon as possible. I find it much easier to study when there is nobody around and it is quiet. Studying for half an hour or an hour before classes also sets the tone for the whole day. You are much less likely to skip classes and spend the whole day procrastinating if you are already on campus and you've already gotten some work done.

- Keep an updated to-do list with all of the readings, homework, projects etc. you need to get done for the week. List everything out in small chunks. I did this last semester by listing each question of a problem set and each 10 pages of reading.  It seems crazy but it really worked to keep me motivated because I could constantly cross things off. It makes the work seem doable. It also helps if you want to spread your homework out over a few days.

I’m married with two children and am currently earning my professional doctorate.  I have three school semesters (including the present one) left before graduation.  I am one of the lucky few who have a coveted, high-paying, prestigious, dream-job lined up. But there’s a problem.

I was offered this job this past August. To get such an offer I put forth a gargantuan effort that completely exhausted me: many flights, many cities, much money spent. After securing the offer, I returned to school and told myself, “I need a break.”

First I took one weekend off, then a whole week, then I skipped classes for a month, then I never studied, then I bombed the semester. Luckily, I became very ill around exams. I would have failed anyways, but since I had a documented illness I was able to blame my poor performance on my health. My future employer bought it and I still have the dream job lined up.

However, I haven’t been able to make myself start working again. It’s like a hurdle I cannot clear. I quickly fell behind this semester. Every night I become terribly disappointed in myself: “what the hell are you doing, why didn't you do shit today?!?!? Another day wasted. Tomorrow I'm going to wake up and get my shit done!” The next day I sleep in. I get up. I do no work. I cannot stop procrastinating. Here are examples of how I've been spending my days:

* Decide I want to play chess. Spend 10 hours researching chess books and order $400 worth of chess books off Amazon.

* Spend 3 days planning a healthy diet and starting P90x. 

* Spend a week ripping 90+ cds to FLAC.

* Watch all 13 seasons of King of the Hill in 8 days. 

* Read “Getting Things Done,” “Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,” “Talent is Overrated.”

* Spend 20 hours straight on Reddit.

* Make 50 servings of soup and freeze it.

A week ago I realized if I didn't pull my shit together I was going to fail this semester and lose my job offer. This would completely derail my life. [edit: we'd probably lose our house, car, everything, and move back in w/ family]. I told my wife that she had to take the kids and go to her parents so I could power through all this work and get my shit together. She’s a great person, said she understood, took the kids and left me alone three days ago.

Since then I've done nothing. I just keep doing unimportant shit and cannot start working. I’m in a rut and just cannot get out. This has lasted 8 months. I need help. I need to start working but I cannot. This has never happened to me before; I've always been a hard worker. What can I do to get my shit together?

**[edit:] This is the first time I've asked for help. I feel truly lost. I've sent my family away, there are no distractions, I just cannot start, I'm starting to feel really fucking desperate. I don't know what to do.**

***

**[edit 2:] Last night I made breakfast and coffee and put it in the fridge so I would be ready to start in the morning. I had planned to get up at 6am, but I didn't fall asleep until 4:30 so I ended up hitting the snooze until 10:30. The past week I've been hitting it until 1:00pm, so getting up at 10:30am was a mini-accomplishment. I tried some of the advice, here, about writing out my goals. I also thought about neolduser's comment:**

&gt;A true sense of your self-worth. A true and lasting motivation will not come from within yourself. It will come from your relationships with your family, friends, and, if you are religious, with God. Further focusing on yourself, beating yourself up for your flaws, trying to pump yourself up because of your potential and past accomplishments, and other inward facing tactics will, in my experience, only dig the hole deeper. Forget yourself. Think of your family. Now start working. Think of their unconditional acceptance of you and the immense worth they find in you. Now think of their needs and how your work helps fulfill them. Now start working. Think of all the ways you can be there for them and then just start moving. Don't beat yourself up over your flaws, they do not define you. You should also probably seek professional help, don't let pride stop you. Good luck.**

**This may sound dumb, but last night I put a framed picture of my kids on the coffee table and I placed my house slippers in front of the picture. I wrote out:**

&gt; ""You will get up, eat breakfast in front of your sun lamp, play a little chess to wake yourself up, and finish a cup of coffee. Afterward, when you're ready, you will walk over to the picture, think about your family, and put on your slippers. Once you put on your slippers you will turn on Tannhauser (a 200 min. opera recording) and study without moving until the opera is over. If you do can do just that, for your family, your day will have been a success.""

**I just finished my coffee and cleared off my desk. I've set a timer for 45 min. so I can have some time to clean up this room. Once the timer goes off. I'm going to look at the picture, put on my slippers, turn on the CD player, and do work for the first time in 8 months. See you guys on the other side.**

The thoughts you have when browsing Reddit keep you enthralled with the little questions even if they are dead ends because they are spaced so close together in time.  They feel like a series of very small, somewhat satisfying achievements and there's always time for another click.

The thoughts you have at the gym or achieving other long-term goals are spaced **farther apart** in time.  There's no immediate answer so you are forced to sit and crunch numbers or analyze facts, which feel like more complex brain functions. You're forced to draw conclusions and  **then rest** on it, file it away, and clear your thoughts for a moment.

You don't get this resting period with Reddit or other addictions.  It's a continuous dosage of lows and highs but no conclusion.  You never get to sit and let it sink in.

I'm a slacker. To be honest, talent isn't as great as people make it out to be. Laugh if you want to, but when you're 25 and you realize you don't work hard because you've never had to...it's a tough hole to crawl out of.

   I never really worried about my weight. My metabolism has been strong enough to keep me just shy of being “fit” despite a steady diet of fast food, soda, and snack foods. I had climbed up to around 225 from about 180 in high school...over about 7 years. I think we all *want* to lose weight, but so few people care it hardly matters.

   Anyway. The point of this post is to hopefully offer up something that can help you climb out whatever dark pit of unfulfilled potential you find yourself in. I'm a big fan of paying it forward, and a big thanks go out to the helpful wolves over at R/GetMotivated. You guys are awesome, and I wouldn't still be making progress without you.

   I think everyone needs a moment where you really *get* that you have to change. Something that scares you. Rustles your jimmies. Takes that part of your self-esteem that says you're “good enough” and shakes it. Like a demon smiling at you from the dark...whispering “Sure. You're good enough. Don't worry about skipping that run. You're fine.” The words might be reassuring, but you can feel the malevolence. It's in the air all around you, and it makes your hair stand on end. You need a moment when every little bit of you sees the future and it feels **wrong**. So, here's my moment.

   My ergonomic, padded chair squeaked a bit as I pushed out from my desk. I had just finished yet another call from yet another faceless voice, and my regularly scheduled break beckoned. My coworker(Let's call her Linda) glanced over and smiled up at me. Linda is a...larger woman. Her skin is a caramel brown and her black hair is always pulled up in her signature ponytail. She looked over at me and started told me about how excited she was X event going on with her kids. Her words buzzed away, as these superficial conversations are want to do. Hard to focus when the caffeine rush fades.

   On a whim, I asked her what her favorite food was. I didn't know which grease peddler I would be stopping at for my daily dose of salt and sugars. She happily started telling me a story about the best nachos she had ever eaten. Linda's face morphed into a beacon of ecstasy as she talked about how savory and warm their cheese was, and the salty flavor of the meat. She made a happy grunt, much like a pig enjoying her slop. The face she made is still burned into my memory.

   In that face I saw every morbidly fat kid I've ever known enjoying a twinky. Every soda sucked down by a pimply teenager. Every overweight cop munching on a donut. It was **wrong**. That was NOT me. I will NOT be another flabby American. I will NOT die of heart disease in my 40s. **NO**.

   I did 50 sit-ups on my next break. I walked around the center on my lunch. I gave up soda, and haven't touched the stuff for a month and a half now. I'm finally making some progress, but every day is a new choice to keep going.

   Please look for that moment. Whatever it is that makes you snap out of your day-to-day grind and say **NO**. Frankly, I don't expect this post to do it for you. You need something that resonates down through your soul. But when you do find it, write it down. Look at it every single day...and when you can, help someone else catch fire, too.

It conjures up images of somebody standing over you with a stick, telling you that you're wrong. **But self-discipline is different.** It's the skill of seeing through the hollow shouting of your own impulses and piercing their secret. They have no power over you. It's all a show, a deception. Your urges scream and bluster at you; they cajole; they coax; they threaten; but they really carry no stick at all. **You give in out of habit.** You give in because you never really bother to look beyond the threat. It is all empty back there. There is only one way to learn this lesson, though. The words on this page won't do it. But look within and watch the stuff coming up-- restlessness, anxiety, impatience, pain-- just watch it come up and don't get involved. Much to your surprise, it will simply go away. It rises, it passes away. As simple as that. 

**There is another word for self-discipline. It is patience.**

**Emotion. Logic. Instinct.**

Have you ever seen someone just go ""fuck it"" and talk to a girl? Or suddenly go from a joking carefree manner to a serious type work mode? Or something as simple as waking up at 3am in the morning? We all see it or know someone who can do it. Then we think  *""I could never do that*"" or ""*I wish I could do that*"" or you try to do it and end up not doing it.

Emotion, logic, and instinct are the things stopping you from being who you want to be. It's either you don't want to (emotion), tell yourself not to (logic), or habitually don't do it (instinct). It is one of these things, these are the three people.

**What do I do?**

1. Identify which of the three is stopping you.

2. Realize you're only one entity.

Remember those T.V. shows where the main character has an angel or devil pop up on their shoulder? It's exactly that situation. Your inner monologue with instinct, emotion, and logic. You have to realize how silly it is not to be able to be what you want to be. You need to make that monologue ""poof"" just like in the shows.

*Things to keep in mind:*

*This doesn't fix everything. It's just the ""switch"" to get you to do something.*

*Do not apply this tactic to all your decisions. Just the critical ones. We all grow up with our own personal tastes, thoughts, and ""things that we just do"" which is how we get our individuality.*

I'm a college kid who, after leaving my cross country/track running lifestyle, have learned that I need to lower my caloric intake and start becoming cautious of junk and high fatty foods, you know, like a normal adult. It sucks, and I wish I'd talk myself into getting into that marathon shape again, but until then, that's what I deal with.

Sometimes, on days such as I've had today, where I've got a straight load of boring, boring classes and a ton of work to do for them afterwords, it's just necessary as a mental health break to do something less productive. For me, it's gaming and sleeping. That part is fine. However, it can be hard to ""get in"" to the productive mindset and start doing things.

Before you do your thing, swallow your frogs and **prepare as much of your work as possible without actually doing it**.

But it's time for me to explain my situation and maybe some of you might be able to help me to get my life back on track. 

I'm 36 years old and I live in a small town with a population of 22,000 people. I live here because my family lives here and I'm unable to provide for myself. I dropped out of high school toward the end of 10th grade and I've never followed up. I don't have an G.E.D. or any other form of alternate education. However, I don't feel as though I'm an uneducated person and people that get to know me, then later find out that I never graduated, often say that they're surprised because I seem like a well educated person.

I've had a handful of jobs in my early 20s, mostly from having signed up at a temp agency. But all in all, I've actually worked(gotten a paycheck &amp; paid taxes) for less than a years worth of time. 

There are reasons for dropping out of school and having worked so little time, but I would really prefer not to talk about them as I'm not proud of some of the things I've done. However, some recent changes and additions to my life have caused me to want to improve my situation, my life and my future, so that I can be a better man for the people that I care for. 

The problem is that aside from obtaining a G.E.D., I don't know where to start. I don't have enough money to get any sort of education that might help me to get a better job or career. There's nothing in my town but the typical employers, Wal-Mart, fast food places, factory work or working at the hospital. 

Anywhere that has me working directly with people all day isn't a good option, as I'm incredibly shy and have the type of anxiety issues that cause me to have panic attacks, which in turn would likely cause me to up and leave the area, resulting in being terminated from the job. I don't think I'm qualified for any jobs at the hospital or other similar places.

Something I do have however, is time. I have 8-12 hours a day, almost every day, to start working toward something better. I have access to a public library and of course, the internet. This morning I've signed up at Khan Academy and have attempted to start practicing/learning what I can there, to pass my G.E.D. test

From Wikipedia

&gt;""The Stanford marshmallow experiment refers to a series of studies on deferred gratification in the late 1960s and early 1970s led by psychologist Walter Mischel then a professor at Stanford University. In these studies, a child was offered a choice between one small reward (sometimes a marshmallow, but often a cookie or a pretzel, etc.) provided immediately or two small rewards if he or she waited until the experimenter returned (after an absence of approximately 15 minutes). In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI) and other life measures.""

I'm sure the science and psychology behind it all is debatable, but I'm not here to do that. I'm here to simply relay a philosophy I have used to get disciplined and motivated. Put that damn controller down, and think higher level. The little dopamine you're getting now from virtually shooting someone with a fake gun is nothing compared to how happy you are when you achieve a life goal that you have put in hours of work for. Life is bigger than the little ""now moments"", there are grander things to achieve and if you keep thinking about yourself ""in the now"" then you're helping out yourself in the future. 


To me, it's as easy as this: if some little punk can wait for two marshmallows, then I can sit down, read through this book to pass my test.

I know there are a thousand posts like this one and for that I'm sorry. But I am seriously at a bad point here. I have a paper due tonight at midnight (that's a little more than 3 hours) and I haven't even started. This is a recurring pattern time and time again. I wait, wait, wait, until there is barely any time left and then I stress to high hell. The stress either bangs out a B paper in very little time or - lately, more often - I bail and write nothing, opting for the late grade. 

The procrastination comes from fear. Fear of difficulty, failure, maybe something else. All I know is that the fear is CRIPPLING. People who say ""just do it"" do not help. I feel like they don't understand what's going on in my head. It literally feels as though I CAN'T start. 

Every time I procrastinate like this, I think it gets worse. It is becoming less of a habit and more of a certainty. What I need to do is start these tasks earlier, yet for some reason there is some force holding me back with intense strength. Every time I have a paper due soon I get depressed because I know what is going to happen and I hate myself for it.

Does anyone have any tips for battling these fears? I have heard ""break it down and do a bit at a time."" While I know this is the better way to complete a large task, my problem lies in even starting. I AVOID STRESS LIKE THE PLAGUE. It's a personality problem.

Anyways... encouragement, help, advice; anything would be welcomed.

1370970685.0,109,self.getdisciplined,1g4s2w,Cutting your losses.,,127,18,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1g4s2w/cutting_your_losses/,"I'm not sure if this belongs here, but this does relate to something I've noticed about my previous gaming addiction and the turn around I have made recently. I'm new to this sub, but I think this will resonate with some of you a lot. Apologies for the length... 

Looking back during those days I would spend playing a competitive  online game for... the entire day, every day. I noticed that every day, I was dissatisfied. When I woke up, I knew that I spent the prior day, week, and month doing almost nothing but gaming, and I knew that today would be yet another wasted day. I didn't like gaming every day and wasting my time being competitive at something that was totally useless, but I continued doing it anyway. Why?

There are of course going to be multiple reasons, but I believe a big one is this concept of cutting your losses. I thought to myself, ""Well, I've already wasted almost all my time, so what's the point? I might as well waste another day."" It sounds ridiculous when you clearly articulate it, but that was essentially my excuse. That was my excuse for procrastination, and putting things off for yet another day. 

This thought pattern was so deeply embedded that I extended it to my entire life, particularly the past few years. It's a long story and the details are irrelevant, but I had some major setbacks and failures, and my low self-esteem caused me to think to myself, ""Well, I've fucked up too hard already and wasted so much time, what's the point? I don't even think I'm capable of doing X anyway, it's too tiring, and it would take months, maybe even years to turn myself around. Let's just login to League of Legends... What's another day of gaming?""

I know this analogy isn't 100% (and I know a gambling addiction is more serious), but imagine a gambling addict who received exactly $1000 every day. He goes to the casino, and he is very unlucky. Investing his money into the casino never brought long-term gainful returns. He always built up small wins over the day, moments of exciting gratification, but toward the end of the day, he would start losing. But rather than cutting his losses, he says to himself, ""Well, fuck it, I've already lost so much already, might as well keep going.""

Every day, he does this. It seems like insane behavior from the outside. If you asked him how he feels about gambling, he would tell you, ""I hate it, but every day I tell myself maybe it will be different this time even though I know it's unlikely. I've already lost tens of thousands of dollars. What's another $1000? It doesn't matter anymore. Even if I tried to invest the money somewhere else, it's too hard, and it would take too long. I'm not even good at investing, I'd probably lose it anyway no matter what I did. The small wins are exciting, every day, I get a little better at it! It's an exciting escape, I get so caught up in the action that I forget everything for just a little while longer.""

This is bullshit self-deception though. Not only is it obvious that the odds are against winning over the long-term, but why does losing a large amount of money justify losing a small amount? Even if your losses add up to $100,000, why would that justify gambling another $1000 away? 

In fact, this line of reasoning should lead to the *opposite* conclusion. If you have lost $100,000, this makes $1000 even more important. If you justify losing money with prior lost money, the cycle will never stop, you will simply lose money until you're dead. 

It's similar to the way I was spending my days. Instead of waking up with money, I was waking up with a 16-18 hour day. I woke up and didn't even tell myself, ""Today is the day it changes!"", I just caved and said, ""Fuck it, what's the point, changing is too hard. My friends are moving on with their lives and becoming adults and starting to forget about me, and I'm just sitting here masturbating. It's too late to change anything. I don't even have it in me. I'm too weak. I'm tired all the time. This isn't even possible... But hey I might reach diamond IV today, let's just login to League...""

Then I realized how ridiculous this way of thinking was, and simply made the decision to change, then did it.

*Even though it was originally written about fapping, it really struck me as being really applicable to procrastination as well. So I have slightly edited it, and replaced it with context relating to procrastination! So check it out - awesome piece of info!*

&gt;""The key to stopping this behavior is understanding the root causes of it. There seems to be a mantra on this board that basically tells you ""just don't fap"", but how you actually stop is a mystery. Its the best kept secret here, and there are a variety of techniques that can be found to help you sidestep cravings but none that actually address the root problem. 

&gt;It took me about 5 months to realize what I was doing wrong, and now that I know, the solution is so simple its sad. There is just so much more to this behavior than a desire for pleasure. No, there is something underneath this behavior. When the cravings come up, it is a sign that your body is getting out of balance...your brain has been using procrastinating as a way to shift emotions. It has been using this behavior as a way to bring equilibrium in your body. **In essence, your brain has been using procrastination as a drug to escape reality and forget / cope with the stresses of your every day life.** 

&gt;So how can you beat it? Well its quite simple really. You just have to make your life worthwhile without this behavior in it. You have to fall in love with the person that you become when you don't procrastinate. In essence, you have to love life. I want you to take a look at your life right now, and think of ways that you can make it better. Think of things that you can do to love yourself more. The point of this is to improve yourself, not just stop a behavior. The behavior is clearly meeting needs that aren't being met somewhere in your life. Once you find those needs and start fulfilling them in healthy ways, you'll realize that you never needed this behavior to begin with. 

&gt;I'll give you an example from my life: I used to be a very sedimentary person, always at the computer playing video games, all that jazz. Since starting this process, I have managed to drastically change my life. I started to exercise, I started reading more, started going on daily long walks, started to eat better (no more junk food), I stopped watching tv and movies so often. I started to study harder, etc. 

&gt;**I did not realize it until recently, but really all I have done was give myself a reason to wake up in the morning and go outside. I gave myself a reason to stop escaping reality, and that desire to escape reality was the root cause of the behavior.**

&gt;The recovery process is two fold (with a ton of in between steps but you'll figure those out if you do this): 

&gt;Step one is to make your life worth living, if it isn't, you're going to have to change to make it so. You have to love the person you become when you don't procrastinate. You're going to need to make it easier for yourself to choose life over the need to escape reality, and for that, you really have to love your life. The more you enrich your outside life, the more ammo you'll have against the cravings. 

&gt;Another thing you can do is create affirmations. These are short positive statements that you read outloud to yourself every morning and every evening...in the form of ""I am..."". An example would be ""I am proud of my accomplishments"". You can mention your relationship with god in these as well. You might think of it as a pile of nonsense, but believe it or not...if you say something with *emotion* for 30 days, you will actually start to feel that change in your life. 

&gt;Once again, the goal is to love your life. Love yourself. Give yourself no reason to shift your emotions and escape reality. 

&gt;Step two: Once you get to a place where you really love your life, where you've really improved yourself on a drastic level...the next step is to eliminate stress in any way you can. One of the biggest reasons for my relapses is the fact that I procrastinated a lot in the past, and my body would crumble under the stress. I put myself in a position where I have to choose between stressful work and giving in to a craving, and that is not where you want to be when your cravings are beating you to a pulp. Stress will make the choice between choosing life and this behavior a lot harder to make. My solution to this problem: Handle your business quickly. Don't leave stuff till the last minute. Get the work out of the way as fast as you can. Make it your first priority, not your last. **Get the stress out of the way so that you can leave room to do the things you love to do. The things that you've fallen in love with. Then the choice becomes ""living a fulfilling life, or escaping"", and you will find that making that choice is significantly easier.** 

&gt;In my personal life, the elimination of stress is where I am at right now. I am currently in a very difficult semester in college, and struggling to get work done quickly. I procrastinated a lot in the month of september, and so now I have dug a hole for myself that I am trying desperately to get out of. If I can get my stress back on track, then this will become easier. The reason why I relapsed most recently was because I left myself the choice between doing difficult mathematics for 7 hours, and escaping reality. As you can see, for an addict, it is very difficult to get out of this choice without caving, especially when you have bad cravings. 

&gt;**The final goal in your recovery process is to be able to choose life over this behavior. The more you love your life, the easier the choice will be between escaping reality and going out to live your life to the fullest.**",,False,,t5_2uzju,1349239157.0,,Star,True,t3_10t5ux,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/10t5ux/we_use_procrastination_to_escape_reality/,

I have always had motivation for so many things, but I could never hold to it long enough to reach success in its way.

Let me give you a tip that have helped me to keep up, and get up, and keep going.

Dress up! You feel like you want a perfect body, but you just can't find discipline to eat right and go to the gym every day? When you wake up, dress up for it. Put running shoes on, pack your bag, eat a banana and you WILL go. I can't stretch this enough, if you dress for it, the chances are so much higher that you WILL GO!

Do you want to be rich but you are too lazy to get interested in investments and spending a lot of time reading and analyzing? Put that suit on man, just put it on and look in the mirror. That looks sick! Now go and get it.

This may sound too easy, but really, for stepping stones this is great. Most of the people who go to bed late, they watch motivational videos of   people, e.g athletes or bodybuilders. They say to themselves, when I wake up I will go outside and run. And then you wake up...bwuuaahhhhh I guess i'll stay in this warm and cozy bed. We have all been there. Just don't think of 'i have to go running now', think of 'i have to put on my running clothes'. You do that and you just stand there. Ask yourself.

Now, if you're like me and have never written regularly before, but want to write that short story you've always had knocking around your head, or even just start a regular journal to record your accomplishments with self-discipline, here's what I did:

When I was just starting out, I set a goal and limit of five sentences per day.  That's a tiny, tiny amount, but it got me in the habit of setting aside a ""writing time"" each day.  Limiting myself to 5 sentences was easy at first (I only could think up five sentences at a time), but after a few days, I found myself wanting to write more and more in addition!

After a week, I raised the limit to 10 sentences.  Notice that this is a *limit*, not a goal.  I wasn't stretching for filler sentences to try to get to a certain word count or number of paragraphs; my whole mentality is flip-flopped.  I *wanted* to write more, but I couldn't because I was stopping myself and making sure those 10 sentences were the best damn sentences I could muster in that day.

Gradually, over time, I played it by ear and set the limit higher and higher as I grew better as a writer.  I now journal regularly and I'm halfway through my short story.

Just try it once, it doesn't take very long.

Set a timer for half an hour. Then go, sit in front of a wall until the timer goes off. No daydreaming, just sitting, noticing things, enjoying the silence. You do that silently, without moving, eyes open.

That's it. Get going.

Still here? You want more information? Okay, here is what you can expect.

Within this half hour you will experience everything that keeps you from achieving your goals.

You will doubt: ""Why am I doing this? Is that even worth it? This is obviously an idiotic waste of time! I could do so many more productive things""

You will whine: ""I don't want to do this anymore. This is boring. I want to go back on reddit!""

You will drift off: ""Flowers and bunnies. Flowers and bunnies. Showers and bunnies. Sex. Sex bunnies boobs...""

You will fidget around: ""This is uncomfortable. I should just slightly crane my neck. Ah. Better.... Wait. It's not. Better move back again...""

See how this might be useful? Now try it out!

Back again? Okay. You might not have managed half an hour. No biggie. Just learn something from the experience: What were the thoughts and feelings that got you to abandon your goal?

Note them, and next time when those things come around to sabotage you, you will know them. They are your old naggy relatives now. You may have to listen to them, but you certainly don't have to do what they say.

You have managed half an hour? Congratulations. That was discipline. Remember that attitude, and carry it over into your life.

Writing is a discipline rather than a creative outpouring in the midst of the Muse.
2. It requires a set amount of effort each day. Even journalling is best done by taking a few moments to reflect every day. Generally, writers work to a word target - a set number of words they wish to write every day.
3. Its also best to have a set comfortable place with minimal distractions. Alter your surroundings to assist your goals. You are the master of your environment, but if distractions persist don't quit - work on your internal self control.
4. Keep organized. Yes! many writers are well organized, with files containing character notes, chapter notes etc. and if your work contains research, research notes. These can be held as a simple collection of text files, a personal wiki or special software - Scrivener.
5. Get a writing buddy / work group for motivation, meeting your goals, feedback on your work etc.
6. Get better mental tools by researching writing - get knowledgeable about the process, the tools, the tips the tricks.
6. Write! Seriously close the browser right now and get writing. :-)

You may notice similarities in the actions I describe and the steps needed for various other activities here, and I notice it all the time too. Discipline is a process and it has very very wide applicability.

I have tried making a timetable (A written one and created an online one) but it doesn't work as I have different stuff to do every day (I may get asked to play tennis at a similar time to my study time) and it completely throws my day off course.

I found an app called OmniFocus but I'm sure tons of other apps have this feature. It has an option to only show the next task on the list. This feature transformed my use of these things into a daily habit.

The rule is simple, no matter what that task is, you have to do it until it's done. Then you check it off and a new one pops up from the nether realms.

The next thing I did was to use only one list rather than multiple lists. I've learned that having to manage multiple lists makes me not want to use the tool anymore, so I just lump everything into one list. Something boring like buying new blinds gets equal weight to studying drawing, so everything gets done. You just add items as you think of them, so you can't choose the most fun thing first.

1369604892.0,98,self.getdisciplined,1f3omk,My exam advice for learning essays and derivations whilst an undergraduate,,112,14,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1f3omk/my_exam_advice_for_learning_essays_and/,"Hi r/getdisciplined, 

I've just done two very tough exams, one in maths another essay based.

The two modules were very different and required a lot of learning, both of the modules had little in them that one could understand, even after a semester of lectures. However, we were supposed to do essays on the topics, include extra reading and show, in short that we understood the topics. I think that a good method for learning for this style of exam may be important to many on r/getdisciplined. So here's my advice.

My style of learning was to prepare answers that would do well and then learn those. Below are my tips for 1. creating the answers, 2. for learning them.

**1. Answer creation:**

**1a**. *Speak to your colleagues.* Class mates are best and speak to more than one. Once you find out what everyone else is doing you will realise that one, you aren't as far behind as you thought, two you'll see what everyone else thinks is required.

**1b**. *Go through the lecture notes.* Your lecture notes are meant to guide you, some times they may seem daunting (especially if you've missed some key lectures). In this case speak to the lecturer, if the lecturer is not useful speak to a colleague after half an hour of trying to get to grips with it.

**1c**. *Question spotting.* Find which questions have come up before. Write down all of these questions and ADD any questions of a similar style that could occur from your lecture notes. When adding questions make sure to be as broad as possible within the framework the lecturer has provided. Look at exercise questions that have been set by your lecturer and compare these to previous exam questions, if they are similar its highly likely they’ll come up.

**1d**. *Read around the topic.* To get a good answer for your topic you need to show some extra reading. This may come in the form of academic journals or books/online resources. When reading academic journals focus on the abstract, introduction and the conclusion. 95% of papers that I have read have had all that you could ever want to put in an exam within these sections, it's often a waste of time to read more. Books/online resources often explain the concepts in layman terms and may include academic references which you can in turn refer to. This is possible for every undergraduate subject.

**1e**. *Plan for each possible question within allocated time* Following from 1c: exams have a set layout that a lecturer will tell you before it comes up. Work out how long you have for each section then.

**1f**. **Structure.** *Structure* This is to be combined with your planning. Each essay should have a structure and one that you can relate to quickly. Being dyslexic I find this tough to do. My method is to initially brainstorm points and then, if possible, to find a recurrent theme within the essay. For instance, I had to write a literature review on a certain topic. I brainstormed all papers that I could think of and some important points. I then wrote the papers in chronological order, this made sense as each built on the next though an order which works for your essay is what you desire. I then came up with the recurrent METHOD, FINDINGS, WEAKNESSES/ANALYSIS way of breaking each paper down. 
Now this method must change slightly when you don’t know what question will come up. It is key here to make your answer flexible enough to cut out waffle when asked a specific question. For instance: say I had a question explain the Economics of Labour demand, this is a topic which includes value of marginal product and elasticity of demand and has 45mins allocated total. Now VMP and Elasticity of LD may also be asked as individual 15min questions. Hence I’d plan the 45min Q with an Intro, then VMP then ELD then Conc. If I were asked a 15min question on VMP I’d cut out the rest.

**1g. Colour**
I think this is the most important thing I could recommend along with timing. Buy 10 felt tip pens all of different colours and a stack of A3 (it’l be the best money you spend). Make sure you have bright visible colours that are distinguishable from each other and black.
Now say you have 4 topics to learn, I use red for topic 1, blue for topic 2, orange = 3 brown =4. On top of that I use Green as difficult to remember, pink as vital, and Black (and black only for this) as the journal author and year of publication. I then construct my answers in their major colour, but bracket each title, sub title in a green cloud and extend a line from it to the bottom of that subsection (then repeat cloud). Big subsections have a big green square and prongs on the outer side of them. I can see nearly all of my notes when I’m in an exam through this method of learning.
If you have graphs then draw the graph axis in its section’s colour. 
Also, add pictures if possible. For instance, I had to remember that an I(1) process dominated an I(0) process during persistence change. To remember this section I drew a pink stick figure with a handlebar mustache and big biceps and a top hat in a boxing ring vs a plum. The boxing ring was red, as is the persistence change section.


**2. Learning answers:**

**2a**. *Timed Answer* Firstly write your answer using the same equipment you’d use in your exam but looking at your coloured notes whilst timing the answer with a stopwatch. You’ll see very quickly whether you need to cut things or not. If you do need to cut things do so, do not think that you can write faster. I’d always recommend cutting your answers to 5mins under the allocated time limit. This gives you some scope to play within the exam and will also make you focus on the key points. This write out is a key learning process.

**2b**. *Record answer* on your phone or on a recording device record yourself, either reading the answer written in 2a or by reading your coloured notes and expanding on them in your own way.

**2c**. *Re-write answer 5 times* The first time you do this look at your notes for 10mins before, then cover them and write the answer out from memory. Place in green or pink stars anything that you forget. For the second and third times repeat above but now create a new sheet of forgotten notes for each section and look at this pre the third write up. 
For number 4, make sure that you have not seen the notes for that section for at least an hour. For number 5, no seeing for 3 hours.

**2d** *Difficulty with a specific point* If you cannot remember something then use the **look say cover write check technique**. Do it in that order and repeat until you get it, it should be the 3rd or 4th attempt.

----------------------------
And that should be enough. I’ve found that with the above, 5 times writing out and a recording means that I remember the essays/derivations and can break them up/apply them.


I hope some of it is useful.

TL;DR
Read the italics and look at what you think is appropriate for you. Focus on **communicating with others, COLOUR, timing and speaking out loud**. The above varies from module to module but I would say it takes between 5-10 days to do.

Edit: Final point, there is always time to improve. The 5 to 10 days is near true, for safety but some modules can be learnt within a day with these techniques. Give yourself as much time as possible for ease of mind, but always remember any 'I can't do it' attitude is never 100% correct. To relieve stress I cut caffeine from my diet completely, even green tea. I meditated for 15-30mins every morning see here: http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1835/ and I always ate decent quality food (cut anything that would spike my day but end in a low ie fast food).

Work on yourself. 

Work on your vision. 

As you change people who have known you for a while will make fun of you. They will try to stop you. They are threatened by your transforming into a different person. That is too bad. You stick with your vision of what you want to be. Lock onto the idea that you can be that. Be patient. Know that it is coming. When you work out, you can't really see the results for a few weeks. This is the same with your vision. 

See what you want, but then, more importantly, be in alignment with that vision. Do things that are only moving you towards that vision. You can't live in the dream career you want, while holding onto a job you hate. You can't have the ultimate relationship while you are dating someone you don't want. You can't get massively healthy without staying in the alignment of the diet and work out that you want to be. 
Do not focus on the people around you. If you have to focus on anyone, only make it be the people who are where you want to be. Learn from them, and more from your vision. 


Comprehend this. Know for sure that what you want is possible. If you don't believe it's possible, you can't move towards it. Why would you? Now here is the really big one, know that it is possible, but don't know how. If you can see how immediately, your vision is too easy. You want a vision that is so exciting, that many different ""How's"" show up continually. 


Be willing to trust and know that the thing you want is doable and HOLD that vision. You will suddenly be shown many different ways to get there. When those ways show up, don't be all surprised and get excited about the method. You will then be trapped in that method. Instead, get excited about what this implies. You had not seen that method, and now you do. This means there are many many other methods that you can't see right now. Be excited only that the sky is the limit. 


Stay open to more. What you know now is nothing compared to what is possible. Be willing to admit you know very little, this leaves room for growth. The people who act like they already know everything and are not open to change are limited exactly where they are. You have no clue what you are capable of becoming and that is a good thing. 


Envision the type of person that you want to be and then ask yourself, ""What am I doing now, that does not align with what I want to become?"" When you identify the answers, let go of those things. This spells out to yourself or the universe, or god or whatever you want to call it that you are willing to trust and take a leap of faith. You are proving that you don't need to hold onto the old ways. You are willing to move forward and make new ways. 


You are unlimited. 

Trust this. The second you think ""Yeah right"" you've already lost it. You are infinite, see for a while what you want to become, and then be in the alignment of that person. You won't believe what is in store for you. This is way more exciting than just accomplishing something that you can see. This is about transforming who you are. 


Here is the most important part. Actually do this. If you read this and get inspired and then tomorrow you do what you did today, this is just feel good crap. Who gives a shit? With the choice of cutting off the things that truly don't align with your vision and living in the world of only things that do align, you actually transform. 


This isn't just some thing designed to make you happy. It feels good to read, and the problem becomes nobody does anything. Why bother? It already feels good to read this so we might as well celebrate. 


The reason that I write this kind of stuff over and over and over is because I am constantly discovering what a transformation feels like. When people just post positive stuff, but don't do the work, it is silly. That would be like going to the gym and having someone tell you about each machine. You actually have to get on the bench and start working. 


Just like this. You have to actually do this if you want the thing. IF you don't do this, than don't bother wanting the thing. Instead, be ok with where you are. The craziest thing in the world is to wish you were one place and but take no action to move towards it. 

This is real. This is not just another positive BS post. 

Show up and prove to yourself that this is real.""

I'm 26, male, and have had zero employment in the last 3+ years. I barely skated through high school (ended up in alternative because I didn't give a shit). After high school I worked with my uncle doing construction, that lasted 3 maybe 4 months then I quit. From 19-22/23 I was addicted to world of warcraft. When I slowed my addiction I met a girl and have been with her since. We moved in with my dad for a bit, and I started working for a friend of his, which lasted 3 months. 

I don't have any discipline or self worth. I want to make changes to my life but don't know how. It seems like each day I feel different about working, or going to school again, but then I slip back into not wanting to do anything but sit at home. I have nothing to my name that I've purchased. Everything I have is because of someone else, and I hate that, but still can't find it in myself to change. 

I've been on r/getmotivated, but that hasn't helped. I don't know what to do or how to change my thought process. I'm completely broke. No savings, a car that I can't afford (that was bought by my mother), and I live in an apartment that my girlfriend pays for. 

I don't know how to ""man up"", or really do anything an adult *should* do. I'm so afraid of failure, and have zero discipline, and that makes it hard for me to get a job or become something, anything. 

My friends have all grown up, moved into houses of their own, started/starting families and I'm still unemployed, and basically unhirable, need constant financial help from other people, and would be homeless if it weren't for my girlfriend. 

I want to be a better person, but I have no idea where to start, or even how to start thinking about it rationally. I understand that if I don't change soon, life is going to be much harder than it should be, but I'm clueless on how to make myself think differently.

I need a strategy.***

**Background:**

- Got a BS, worked two jobs, saved and applied to grad school. Got accepted and went to grad school, had fiance cheat on me and I lost my shit. I was suicidal, depressed, and bat shit crazy. I spent 2 years being nothing. Dropped out of school, wasted all of my savings, started being a bartender, and became an mmo addict and alcohol addict. MMO ended about 1.5 years ago. I've given up smoking weed for 2 years, I've given up cigarettes for 1 year, I drink a six pack maybe once a week. I quit the bar industry, got certified to personal train and got a job as a fitness trainer/coach for a youth sports company where I was doing operations, but have moved to marketing/coordination in the past month. I've worked there for right at 12 months. I've gotten in the best shape of my life, hitting the gym 5-6 days a week for the past year and a half. Moved in with a good friend, and I've had the same living situation, in a very nice apt, in a very nice area, for 2 years.

**Finances:** 

I have a job that pays all my bills and allows me $100 a week to spend and $100 week to save. It would be more but gas is fucking expensive, and I have to drive a lot for work. I don't go anywhere besides work, gym, or local restaurants/movies that are within a mile driving distance. I have $1200 saved. I just got 2 additional certifications to be a personal trainer, and applied to 15 positions, having call backs at 7 of them currently. I've already been on 5 interviews, with another later today, and several next week. I was recently designated to be promoted to be full time, meaning most work will be telecommuting, email, and work from home, but the promotion and pay won't take into effect for about 90 days. $100 goes to phone, $40 for internet, $200 for water/gas/elec, $400-500 for gas [fucking sucks,] ~$300 for food [grocery store,] $500 for rent, ~$100 for credit card but more if I have it.

**Problem:**

This morning my roommate of 3 years just told me he's moving out. His work is moving him to another  area. I can't afford to keep this place on my own as it is $1200 a month plus ~$250 bills [less during winter, but I'm in Texas and we've had a week of 100+ weather, 105 yesterday.] I can't afford to stay in this same place at a one bedroom, as it is $750-800, and about $150-200 bills. I just spent $1200 on 2 personal training certs [I passed both and am certified,] $900 on new tires yesterday, and I have $400 car insurance in 10 days. I have no one to co-sign, and my credit is not good enough at this time to. I had asked a friend about 8 months ago if he wants to move in together, but he has saved nothing in 8 months.

Every place I've looked at wants first and last month up front, plus deposit, plus the cost of utilities deposit [$400+.] By my estimation I need about $3000 in the next 40 days, or at least $1500-2000 at minimum.

**Solutions:**

If I get one of more of these jobs I can maybe swing it. Most of them have me doing 2nd/3rd/4th interviews. One of them has me paying $200 for an additional certification that they will pay back in one year [corporate gym.] One of them has a 2-3 month “internship” process where I don't know if I'll be getting paid. I'll still be able to work my normal job at minimal hours, but I doubt I'll be able to actually . The one I really want most will be purely sales driven, which I know I can do.

I can live in my truck, it will suck but I can do it. I can take showers at the gym, and go to work. I have a friend with a room for rent in a house [$500 per month] but it's in a shady part of my city, and it's 4 college aged kids. I cannot move in with any family. No one lives within 4 hours of me, and I cannot ask anyone for money. My GF has offered for me to live with her, but I do not want to do that, as I would still have to store all my shit, and it would be the same thing as me living out of my truck, just having a place to store my clothes. She's a student, with an internship, and has to have her parents help her,. The last and only gf I ever lived with completely screwed me financially, which helped put me in the poor situation I was in. I think it would be a bad decision, and I don't want to do it.

I have a Samsung 40'' I can maybe get $400-500 for, an xbox and 10 games that I could probably get $300 for, and a mint electric epiphone I could get $700-800 for. I have about 600 books I could sell at half price books for god knows what. I've got a high end pc and moniter that I could get $1200 for. None of this shit matters to me except for the books and computer. Books I can rebuy, the computer I actually need for work, but will obviously do me no good if I'm homeless.

I/we eat out about once a week, and see a movie maybe 2x a month. I've been studying for the GRE again to go back and finish my master's, but I won't be able to afford the course now. I scored 96 percentile the last time I took it and got a teaching assistantship for a year before I dropped out. I have no doubt I will be able to perform at the same level. I don't hate my roommate as he needs to do whatever he thinks is best, but I will be homeless in 48 days if I can't get a strategy and execute it perfectly. 

**Advice:**

I'm at a loss. I'm in crisis mode. I was on a track, have been living a clean life. I fill my time with work, working out, volunteering, and spending as little money as possible. I have goals, I follow them, and do the best I can to execute as efficiently as possible.

Does anyone see anything I can do? I don't care about things. I will sell them. I have a few clients I already train a few nights a week as I was trying to build up a business. I've applied to 15 positions. I'm trolling craigslist in my free time for anything I can see. I have a current alcohol certification but I don't want to go back into the bar life, as I fucking hate it and I don't want to get involved in a shitty lifestyle again. I have a few hundred I can spend on flyers and try and do bootcamps.

I don't know what to do, but I'm going to try and do everything I can. I'm hemorrhaging financially, mentally, and I will be in the red in just a few short weeks. I feel like all of my progress will be undone and I will be homeless. This was supposed to take 10 minutes to write up, but I've wasted almost all of my lunch doing this.

I post this not to just pimp the video, but to give you a real actionable message.

In the last two months I've REALLY focused on discipline in life. I realized that 40-50% of my day was spent completely WASTED- on reddit, bb.com, e-mail, youtube. And when I say ""wasted"" I'm not even talking about time spent watching movies or playing games. When you're doing those things at least you have an objective. You are PLAYING a game or WATCHING a movie. But on reddit/bb.com you're just aimlessly browsing, often going for half an hour without really reading anything of value or interest to you.

Also, I found myself sleeping in till 3-4pm and just generally never accomplishing what I set out to do in a day.

So, my goal has been to eliminate that waste of time and accomplish more with my day.

To that end I've developed a few key principles that have helped tremendously. One, my alarm goes off at 5:20am everyday regardless of when I go to bed the night before. Often I sleep through until 7, but still, it's going to go off and knowing that forces me to go to bed earlier rather than say ""fuck it I'll just sleep in"". 

Two, I've been writing down my goals each day on a whiteboard. So it reads like this: meditate, read vocab, workout, work, write, video, etc. When I finish a task I put an X next to it and go on to my next task.

Three, I've been constantly writing out goals. I started with my life goals, then year goals,then month goals. Each week I figure out what I need to accomplish that week to move closer to the month goals. Each day I figure out what goals I need to accomplish that day to reach my week goals.

All of this has lead me to becoming productive as a motherfucker. Today before I went into work at 9am I managed to read, do a bodyweight workout, meditate, and put together a video to upload this afternoon. 

If you REALLY want success in life, you NEED to develop iron discipline and an unequaled work ethic.

GOOGLE/REDDIT/WHATEVER - reading blog posts and diatribes about Ruby and Python, and how the other one fails where this one rocks, etc.

2 HRS LATER - huh, I'm exhausted. I have not even made notes of all the reviews/analyses I was doing, because my brain resisted doing that as I mindlessly surfed all this ""useful"" stuff.

**The Idea:**

People always adapt to their environment, and without proper boundaries, people will adapt to the limitlessness and aimlessness of their lives. Forming natural well-trodden boundaries is discipline. 

**Understanding what you can do:**

Men and women will always find ways to relax within the confines of their lives. We always want to be comfortable. Sometimes we give ourselves too much or too little ""space"". You need to understand how much space you're giving yourself. Planning and organizing can be either good or bad depending on the boundaries you're setting for yourself. If you write down homework is due Monday, does that mean it's not due until Monday or you only have until Monday? Depending on perception and the boundary you're setting, you're either telling yourself you have plenty of time or no time, when in fact, you just have exactly Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday which means you should split the homework into four parts and start now.

Don't push or pull yourself to do things, just set a boundary and enforce that boundary.

**No boundaries or constricting boundaries:**

Sometimes these boundaries manifest themselves; people are faced with the extreme limit or limitless boundaries of their lives. 
Like, someone working five part-time jobs to support her family of six, who breaks under the pressure of her limited environment. 
Or, a 400lb man who has held no responsibilities, and has a limitless access to food anytime and anywhere.

**When to use it:**

Use it for problems you have. You need to go to the gym? Well, you need to go to the gym. When can you go to the gym, what will you do at the gym, great. Now that boundary is set. Do it for 21 days, habit will form. The boundary will be trodden well.

I know a lot can't be arsed to read any of this or want a TL;DR, but all I can say is that if you really suffer from this lack of discipline and want to get rid of it, give it a try and read it. Use it as an excuse to procrastinate on the work that you should be doing. ;)* 

I've been subscribed some time now to his subreddit, and have found a lot of people who have the same problem as me, and that is great. However, I want to explain a few things that people seem to be missing. And I think this applies more to the people who have the lack of discipline effectively harming their (future) lives. 

For me, I severely lack discipline. I procrastinate until I really cannot put it off before getting into serious problems, usually delivering a sub par project. Be it school or work, or simple life things that need to be done. If I can get away with it, I will. Noone is there to stop me from doing otherwise, and people close to me have a hard time understanding.

In the past, it caused a lot of guilt. Why not simply do it? Why just not work, get out of bed, do your things as soon as you got time for them, go running or even walking every day. It seems so simple. *Just do it* is what I thought. I felt/feel weak and spineless. People around me don't seem to deal with as heavy as I am, so that really makes you feel you are just being a baby about it. 

All right. Stop that.

You lack discipline. It *is* a serious matter. In some if not most cases, the subscribers to this sub reddit joined to find answers, to get rid of it. But guess what, you won't like it. I know I am not speaking for everyone, but most of you/us will try and not work for it. It's like an addiction. Why be difficult when you can be lazy and not put in effort? It's so much less strain on your brain! So why fight it?

This is what your brain tells you. You see, you reason with yourself. You make it sound logical. Why bike to the store if you can take your car/scooter or whatever. It's kinda like that. It's easier and faster, you are dry, warm. You reason your way out of it, despite it being unhealthier, physically and mentally.

The exact same thing is happening with our discipline. We reason with ourselves, making it sound reasonable not to do something. Why make it hard when it can be easy. There are just a few things missing in our brains that causes us not to have this discipline. And you know, it is going to be fucking hard. It's like an addiction you have to break, you have to fight really damn hard. 

The reason I am telling you all this is because you need to know it won't go away within a few days. Weeks. Even months. You have to think long term. You have to *understand* where the core problem is coming from. Yes, you can oversimplify it. You can say ""Well imnotlegolas, fuck you, but you just gotta do it. I'm here to get discipline. Other people can do it, so can I. That is all there is to it."" Which is partially true, but not a permanent solution. 

For us people who deal with this severely, and haven't seen a change, who all the good advice and tips don't seem to be working, you first need to *prioritize*. To realize what the problem is before you can be thinking about a solution. And you need to give it time. Forcing it on yourself to want it within a week or month isn't going to cut it. For some people yes, but not for the people dealing with this heavier then others. 

For example, my problem is that I have noone watching over me. I am not alone or anything, it's just that people around me are busy with their own lives. I know that I will get out of it if I find my rhythm, and someone to (positively) help me and check up on me. Having someone getting angry at you or punish you for not doing what you should is not the right way. You have to start to understand your situation and get yourself used to it. You are here because you want a change.  

Find a loophole, find another way to achieve discipline. Your discipline machine is broken, and you need to patch it up. And you can't strain it too much or it will break again. This is why you need to build it up and teach yourself this. Just accept the problem first so you can look for a solution. 

**Expect it to be the hardest thing you have ever done, and accept it.** Be okay with it. It will be difficult, but it *won't* have to mess up your life trying to get back on track. Give it time, just do not underestimate it is all I am saying. Try and find the reasons *why* you postpone and procrastinate. In most cases the answer will be more difficult then you think.

It was strange, I found it to be difficult to write my own biography.  I found it to be really motivational, as after writing it - I realized I really wondered how it could be more interesting.  So here's my suggestion, and I'd love to hear feedback on this but:

Write a 4-5 sentence biography of yourself.  Your current accomplishments, a bit of a background, whatever you find most impressive.  Make sure it's truthful, and not hyperbole.  Be proud of what you've accomplished so far, there's nothing to be ashamed of.

NOW: Write a 4-5 sentence biography of your future self.  1 year from now? 2 years from now? It doesn't matter how far out it is, but make it realistic, and really give it a shot.  Say your goal is to start school again, get above a 3.0 GPA, and get out of debt.  ""Jonathan is a part-time undergraduate student at the University of Miami, currently maintaining a 3.5 GPA.  He managed to stay completely debt free by working full time at Awesome Co., where he started working 6 months ago.  He's a graphic designer there, and spends his spare time doing posters for music venues and charitable organizations.""

Now, you have two biographies.  Print them both and put them on your mirror, your desk, wherever you'll see it.  Every single day, you have a choice to make.  What story do you want your biography to tell?

The article was joking around about how common issues with staying focused and productive are considering how many tools and strategies people have developed to combat them. So that's uplifting fact #1 - We are not alone! It's ok to feel ""lazy"" sometimes, everyone gets this problem.

Fact #2, which is the main point of this, is after he was describing using the Circle method of keeping track of tasks (I'll describe below for those interested), he said he used this method and other methods for about a week to a month each before abandoning them and trying something new. The bottom line was, **it's okay if you successfully use a productivity strategy or tool for only a week, and then you can't keep up with it anymore or get bored with it or start slacking off. That's a WHOLE WEEK of productivity you've had! It's okay to try a new method the next week!**

Keeping this in mind has kept my spirits up when a spreadsheet I've been maintaining or an alarm I set or a calendar reminder or a task list or anything else I do to stay on task just ends up in abandon. **It's okay to mix and match and try new things all the time to get things done, as long as you're getting things done!** Using a super slick app one week, and asking a friend to call and remind you of tasks the next? That's okay! You're getting things done!

---------------------------------------------------------

Now for the **circle method** for those interested - this is a very basic pen and paper task list you can make for yourself. Basically, you keep a note pad of to-do lists, and draw an open circle at the beginning of each to-do item. You use the circles accordingly:

* Empty - no progress on this yet
* A line through it - this task has been started, but not finished
* Half full - this task is halfway done
* Full circle - this task is completed
* Strike through entire item - this task is cancelled
* Question mark in or near circle - you need to gather more information first

So basically instead of bullet points, you make circles. A given task can have sub-tasks, too.

At the end of a day/week, you can look at your list and see what's going on by how much black there is. Too many half-full circles? Maybe you're overloaded, try finishing one of those before moving on to the next. Too many single strikes? Okay, you're starting things but not finishing. Maybe you need to break some tasks down into smaller items or maybe you're lost on what to do. Lots of filled in circles? Congrats! You're getting things done!

I've been using the circle method for years now, and it works great for me. Sometimes I keep a very strict checklist with only circle items. Sometimes I'll jot a note on a napkin and add a circle next to it as a reminder that it's a to-do, even if I never use the circle after. Sometimes I'll be taking notes in a meeting and will add circles next to points I need to investigate or work on later. Most of the time? I never even fill in the circles!

1. Its a program that you can blindly follow and see results fairly quickly (60 days) if you are going for fat burn. Insanity isnt big on strength but P90x is. 

2. The quicker results help me keep motivated.

3. Since every workout is an hour long. I just get my ass out and do it. It just feels good.

I'm a Engineering student. Last semester was not exactly how I imagined it to be and I made myself a promise. Study for 2 hours minimum, everyday. Now I already changed a few things in my life already. I have a full worked out schedule, I attended 90% of my classes (going for 100% this semester), my midterm evaluations are pretty good and it feels good. But whenever I’m studying for my finals I’m struggling with the amount of material that I need to learn.  So that’s why I want this to happen.

There are days when I succeed in my 2 hours goal, but most of my days I just spend my time on the internet/games feeling totally unmotivated.

So how does one build up the consistency of doing something everyday and not like once a week “when I feel like it”?

I also am training for a marathon. While my eating habits may need help, I'm still pushing myself physically to accomplish this goal I've set for myself, coming up in November.

She's also very uncomfortable with her body. She's not fat or even chubby by any means, but she has insecurities with her stomach and her legs. I encourage her to go to the gym, but she never does.

I love her to death, we have so much in common, and I'm nothing but happy when I'm with her, but it aggravates me to no end to have somebody complain about things all the time but take no initiative to solve their problems. 

She's expressed distress before, regarding the fact that I'm so driven and hard working while she feels like she's not accomplishing anything. I try to tell her to get out there but she never takes the first step.

I figured I'd give doing a weekly tip a try. We are all trying to achieve self discipline in our lives, and we all use various methods to do so. I think that an area where we could foster some dialogue over an idea would be beneficial to all of us.

anyway, here is the tip of the week.


**Compartmentalize your life.**

I am a college student (I assume the majority of you guys on here are). For a very long time now, I have neglected the beautiful resource that is the library. Now, I go to school at a medium sized University, and we have a pretty big library with lots of tables and desks to sit down and study at. The atmosphere is very quiet, and everybody tends to be engrossed in what they are doing.

I have started doing as much of my school work as possible in the library, and keep as much as possible away from my house. I want to foster a way of life where I take nothing in terms of work home with me, and keep it all in a place very much oriented for doing work. In this way, I am keeping work and play in their own individual compartments, with as little crossover as possible.

I have found there to be a lot of advantages in doing this. I study much more efficiently, and for much longer, at the library. This allows me to get the most out of my time, and leaves more time for relaxing, and doing the things that I enjoy. When I keep all my work in one specific place, it starts to become habit forming. When I am at the library, I am in work mode. When I try to do work at home, it is always difficult due to the sheer amount of distractions. At the library, there is me, my work, and a wall of silent faces. I tend to not be distracted, and, over time, have found I am always in work mode and always productive in my little work compartment.

This leaves my house as a work free zone, and enables me to do the things I enjoy without worrying about doing work. It also ends up providing me with a lot more free time, as I can get so much more done when I am not distracted at the library.

Do you guys agree with this? disagree with this? have you tried it, and found it to work great, or found it to not comply with your way of doing things? Do you have an area where you can keep all of your work, and if not, can you think of alternatives to obvious places like a library?

New version is now available!",laserszsf,93,9,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/12fp44/update_i_made_an_rpgstyle_productivity_app_to/,"A month back I posted here about an application prototype I made to track your projects RPG-style, so you can get things done by racking up points and gaining levels. It actually all got started with a post [from this very subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/zz9aj/does_anybody_here_use_a_rpgstyle_point_tracking/) by /u/yosemitemark. 

Well, since then, I've been working on it and adding features, and I've just come out with a second release. You can check it out and download it on http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeRPG/comments/12fmm6/download_liferpg_r2_is_here_get_it_while_its_hot/ if you're interested. My desire for the future is to come out with mobile and web versions, and your feedback is appreciated! Here are some screenshots and features:

**Screenshots:**

- [LifeRPG with HUD displayed, showing projects for one of my skills.](http://i.imgur.com/kA2Ou.png)
- [Skill Stats window, showing that skill's progress relative to the others.](http://i.imgur.com/qyJP2.png)
- [Project Log window, showing projects I completed yesterday (but my MMT bar is still 55%, meaning none of those were on my existing projects list!)](http://i.imgur.com/EsHWN.png)
- [Edit Profile window, giving myself an amusing title to show on my HUD.](http://i.imgur.com/q2oDs.png)
- [Edit Settings window, assigning a sound for when I level up.](http://i.imgur.com/1BxXq.png)

**Features:**

- **Keep track of your projects** and assign a difficulty, importance and skill to each one.
- **View your projects by order of difficulty**, from the easiest to the hardest, so that you can build up confidence and motivation by tackling challenges in a game-like fashion.
- **Projects are colored by difficulty** to make it easier to navigate the list. (NEW!)
- **Gain points for completing projects**, and watch your level progress bar increase until you LEVEL UP!
- **Dynamic skill system** lets you assign an optional skill to each project, which can be anything you want, so when you complete them your assigned skill will go up. (NEW!)
- **Manage your skills** with the Skills Stats view and see which are beefed up and which ones are lagging. Instantly access your projects for each skill by double-clicking or hitting enter on the highlighted skill. (NEW!)
- **Heads-Up Display** is redesigned, can be toggled on and off, and hides automatically if you move the mouse over it. (NEW!)
- **Customize your HUD** by entering a name and title for yourself in your profile -- Ninja, Wizard, Businessman, Artist -- whatever you want! (NEW!)
- **Project Log** window lets you see a record of projects you've completed, what skill was affected, and what your overall level was, so you can track your progress through time. (NEW!)
- **Momentum Bar** (MMT) -- a totally unique concept, not available anywhere else as far as I know, that motivates you to keep making progress on your goals. Every day, your momentum stat will decrease by a certain amount, and will eventually drop to zero unless you complete a project from your list to make it recharge. See if you can get your MMT bar back to 100% every day! (NEW!)
- **Custom Level Up Sound** -- Select a sound file to play when you reach a new level, perhaps one from your favorite game, or anything else you want. (NEW!)
- **Keep more than one database** so you can track projects for different contexts; like perhaps one database for personal projects and one for your business. (NEW!)
- **QuickAdd Projects** window lets you add projects to your database when you're in the middle of anything, so you don't have to switch back to the LifeRPG main window. (NEW!)
- **QuickDone Projects** window, similar to the QuickAdd function, but marks the project you enter as done, immediately increasing your points and your skill. (NEW!)
- **Manually increase points** with hotkeys so you can adjust your level properly, or to just increase your progress without having to enter any projects or anything tedious if you don't want to.
- **No level cap**, infinite content already available, no DLC ever required :)

... and I have plans for more features in the future, such as an inventory tracking system (to track your stuff), a simple financial system (to track your money), and multiple tweaks, settings and improvements. And more. Also, your input counts!

In the last year, I have lost 120 pounds, gotten into a solid fitness program and manage my diet very well. I've started to do things around the house, doing repairs, doing things with the kids again, really getting most of my life in order.

The problem is, Monday through Friday from 9am until 5:30pm with the exception of lunch when I go to the gym, I am a slug.
I pop back and forth from Facebook to Reddit to Amazon to Craigslist to my various fitness sites (ie Fitocracy). But, I don't do my work.

I am a product manager for a small software company. I should be guiding my development team, working on new sales, answering support emails and writing support documentation. But I don't. If I did, I could really improve my income since I get commission on every new sale. I just am NOT motivated. I can't seem to stop surfing.

The company I work for is good in many ways. My boss does not hover or even direct. I am totally left to manage myself. They provide food and all kinds of side benefits. The let me set up a gym and treadmill in the office to support my fitness program. They even let me bring my dog to work. I can come and go as I please. They treat me very well. Why can't I return the favor by doing what I should be doing? It would benefit them and me both. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? How do I get myself on track? I've been in this work rut for years now.

And yes, I'm aware of the irony in posting this question on Reddit, being one of my problems is being on Reddit too much. Who better to ask than fellow Redditors? When losing weight, I found the people most knowledgable about losing weight were fellow fat people.

[EDIT] Thanks everyone for the really great comments and suggestions. Boiling it down to a 3 things so far.

1- My job doesn't interest or challenge me.
You are correct. It's a rather boring job that just doesn't offer what I really need, despite having great perks and benefits. But, the thing is, I do have a greater than average ability to define what my job really is. SOLUTION: Sit down, create some goals and define my position better so I know what I'm doing and where I'm headed. I really don't want to give up my perks, so I need to make the job interesting. It's in my power to do so.

2- Focus. This is really related to #1, but I decided to break it out. #1 is more philosophical, this is more practical. I need to learn to focus on my tasks. This means having bench marks and achievements. (If only there was a Fitocracy equivalent for being productive at work. If you know of one, share it!) SOLUTION: Daily to do lists, small rewards for completing tasks and make sure I start out productive instead of using the first hour to coast.

3- Kick my internet habit. I spend too much time, well- on Reddit, amongst other sites. SOLUTION: Using those plugins to limit that time and weaning myself off of the time wasting sites is going to be huge. I get bored and if I can't go to those sites, I just may turn to work.

Thanks everyone. This has really got my gears turning. Work is the one area where I really feel inadequate right now.

1364129695.0,83,self.getdisciplined,1awtbx,"My life has ""sucked"" for years and I'm still having trouble getting it better. Can I have some advice?",artelus,97,14,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1awtbx/my_life_has_sucked_for_years_and_im_still_having/,"I guess this is both a post for help and a post to journal my thoughts...

First of all, some positive things:

1. I got a license and a car. It took me years to motivate myself to go practice driving with my dad so I can feel confident enough to take the driving test and to drive my own car (My driving school was bad, so I had to learn most of it myself after I got the green slip from them).

2. I got and maintained a high GPA, though a lot of it is from unnecessary stress that could be avoided by procrastination and doing what I need to do before the last minute.

But my life still feels...sucky. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I think I have mild depression that gets extra bad during times of high stress (exams, etc). and that has gotten in the way of a lot of things. What I want to fix is my habits, and I believe having good habits would help me cope with my depression.

Things I want to do:

* 1. **Go to bed at a reasonable time.** Right now it's 8am and I'm still up. I don't know why, but I'll go to bed as soon as I submit this post. Or maybe I'll browse Reddit a little more, but I hope I won't. 

The fact is, I need sleep to not feel depressed. Right now it's the weekend so it's fine, but during weekdays I am busy as hell and I have classes all day, and yet I only get 5-6 hours of sleep each day. I just have a habit of staying up. If I don't get enough sleep, I have issues with my thoughts. I'm more negative. Lack of sleep can affect me to the point of suicide idelation. But even knowing that, I can't seem to get into the habit of sleeping early.

* 2. Doing the things I need to do.
Apply for internships, applying for classes, etc. Those take me days or weeks to do. I don't know why. I just keep putting them off and time keeps on passing. I don't know what is holding me back. Maybe it's fear, or maybe I'm just lazy. I don't know myself enough to figure this out, and maybe someone with more personal insight can help me.

Also, homework and studying for exams. I'm also pretty terrible at stopping, sitting down and doing those things.

* 3. Working out and being fit.
I've tried to start this habit several times during high school and college. It just never worked. Fitness is a completely different lifestyle than what I am living right now.

I am posting because I feel worried. Time is passing very fast to me, and I still feel like I am holding myself back. I want to do all these things but every time I've tried, I failed. 

I lose myself all the time. I burn away all my free time, reading stupid shit on reddit, watching stupid tv shows that numb my brain, playing games that consume me. This eats up hours of my day. Hours that I need to use for studying, having a fit lifestyle, going outside and making friends, and making my life not feel like shit anymore (the depression).

I remember during the last few sessions with my therapist (the sessions had to end, and I have to find a new one now but I haven't been doing that either like I should), we went over the topic of disappointment. I have been very disappointed in myself, and my life. I feel like it's out of control sometimes. I don't like how I need to send my headphones for repair, and I've been putting it off for over 6 months, and if I've done it sooner I could be using them right now. I don't like how I've never had a girlfriend before, or gotten laid, or did anything impressive like all my friends. But my therapist also suggested that my fear of disappointment is what's been keeping me from making any significant changes in my life, but our sessions ended before we could explore this further. 

Oh well, this is just a random offloading of my worries. I hope I get some good advice out of this.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1awtbx,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1awtbx/my_life_has_sucked_for_years_and_im_still_having/,

I joined the military last August, and while I've not become a disciplined machine of a man, I've made leaps an bounds ahead of where I was. This isn't solely due to the military, it's due, in large part, to my constant work. I've never tried that hard, and that's a flaw on my part, but you don't really need to if you're always trying.

1361449375.0,76,self.getdisciplined,18y877,Entitlement,son_of_bokonon,92,16,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/18y877/entitlement/,"A few weeks ago I went with a couple of friends and my fiancée and saw Gangster Squad. It was a pretty good film, full of good acting and plenty of action to keep things rolling along throughout. It stars a number of great actors, including Ryan Gosling. Granted, he isn’t the best of actors, but that isn’t the general appeal of him to begin with. He has a baby face and he is as smooth as silk. Considering the period which this movie was shot, he wears old suits and has a fashion that is undeniably classic by today’s standards. I’m not going to lie; he looked great. While the movie as a whole was good, what resonated with me the most is how badly I wanted to look as good as him in a suit. Now, my frame is nowhere near his. I have a frame closer to Josh Brolin, although I have a couple of extra layers on me then he ever will I’m sure. But in the excitement of post-cinema dreaming, I wanted Gosling’s look, his body. I wanted to be him. Why wasn’t I like him?  

A few days of mentally going over the images in my head and I became really ashamed of myself.  For all the time I wasted on wanting so badly to have something, my attention was always drawn to questions like: “Why isn’t that me?” “Why don’t I look like that?” “What did I do to deserve this crappy body I’m stuck in?” I felt so entitled to that kind of body just because I wanted it. I had done nothing in my life to ever deserve it at all. I eat crappy food. I rarely work out. I am lazy, uninspired to change. That was the real problem. After doing research and just looking around me, I found that a good number of other people do the exact same thing. At least once a day, I can find someone who feels they are entitled to something that they don’t deserve.  

Ever since then, I have tried to force myself into relating the importance of being honest with myself. It is so damn hard. I try to find a reason to not do something that should be done. I procrastinate and bicker with myself over nonsense, always circling around to a reason why I should have my way regardless. I am such a spoiled person. I think we all are. I have been dieting since the first of the year, and it is so hard not to throw everything out and go to Mcdonald’s and get a double quarter pounder and a large fry and just gorge myself until I’m “happy.” It’s been a real struggle to ignore the pangs that say ‘sleep in’ or ‘we’ll do that tomorrow’.  Tomorrow only comes because the world makes it. I have still yet to convince myself that I will never look the way I feel that I deserve if I don’t get in there and actually deserve it.    

Entitlement is an epidemic. It stops people from acting like human beings in the face of adversity, and it hinders any real progress that we hope to ever make. All in all, no one should ever be entitled to anything. Everything should be earned, not given away. The things that matter in life are this way, why isn’t everything? Maybe there are a lot of things in the world that just don’t matter. I know I can say that there are things that I have lost interest in because they just aren’t necessary anymore. It’s hard to not feel entitlement. It has become the American way of life, but I think that it’s necessary if we ever hope to transcend into something that we can truly be proud of. I know I still feel entitled today, but not as much as I did when I walked from the theater a few weeks ago. I still want to look as good as Ryan Gosling, and hopefully, with a lot of hours of work, it will happen. And when I finally look into a mirror and feel proud of my body, I will know that I have earned it. That is a feeling that entitlement can never replicate.

I've recently started university and I'm not doing well in life in the journey of life, if I keep heading in this direction I'll probably end up killing myself or being a complete fuck up living a life not worthy of living.

1) I have no friends - I have only one person who I sometimes talk to and see about once a month

2) I suffer from social anxiety - find it hard to meet new people and approach people in general, also am socially awkward

3) Have an extremely low self-esteem - due primarily to being really short, having a stutter, etc. never see any good traits about myself

4) Have no hobbies whatsoever - I have no interests in anything, not even video games. I've never had a hobby, never been good at sport, don't even watch sport or movies or anything. 

5) I spent most 90% of my day surfing mindlessly through the internet (reddit, YouTube, wikipedia, anything) especially on weekends where I sleep in all-day then surf all day

6) I'm extremely skinny and hardly eat anything due to having no appetite for food

7) I have no self-discipline. I have achieved nothing in my life. I've started a lot of things but only began them and never completely then. I started going to the gym twice in 2 years, I start for 2-4 weeks then stopped.

8) I hardly any sleep on average around 4 hours max each weekday. I usually sleep around 2-4am and have no idea how to change this horrid sleep pattern. On weekends I usually sleep in to make up for the lost sleep throughout the week.

9) I'm a heavy procrastinator, I always leave things to the last minute, and have been like this since forever

10) I'm extremely unfit, I can't even run for 3 minutes before losing my breath and feeling like vomiting

11) My GPA is already below the 2 due to not turning up to lectures and only studying in the very last minute, this makes me feel sad because I believe I have potential to do much better.  This makes me extremely fucking sad all the time because I want to do better.

12) I have no interest or love for life. I hate it, and do have some suicidal thoughts, but I don't heed them because I don't want to hurt my family even more then I have done now. I'm extremely pessimistic about everything.

I've been trying to complete NoFap for about 3 months now and still can't get passed the 2 week mark. I can't go a week without viewing porn.

My family is currently in a bad financial situation and depend on me to work, but I have never worked a day in my life, and am too lazy to go out and find a job.

I need advice, this is urgent because if I don't try to change my life now is just going to keep spiraling into more and more chaos. 

I'm not trying to gain sympathy that's the last thing I need at this point, it's clearly obvious that I'm a lazy piece of shit who just simply doesn't have the will-power and procrastination and that kick in the ass to achieve his goals and improve his life.

If it doesn't, I apologize. I love this community and I'd hate to go against the rules.

So, through our lives we are in continuous physical, mental and spiritual evolution. We work hard, we make progress, so each day we can be a better version of ourselves than the previous day. But how do we stop identifying with the former, inferior versions of ourselves?

Let me get more specific. As a kid, I was always skinny. Almost malnourished looking. I lived in a kind of bad neighbourhood, so I would constantly get bullied by older and bigger guys. They would intimidate me and sometimes even mug me. I never fought back. There's no way I could have taken them. That was from when I was 13 to when I was 16.

I'm 21 now, and no longer that skinny kid. When I was about 15, I started going to the gym. I'm no Arnold, but I'm pretty muscular. I also did boxing and kickboxing for a while, so I can handle myself. Now here's what happened earlier today. I was going grocery shopping to a shop 5 minutes away from where I live(different neighbourhood than when I was a kid, but way worse). I stop at the ATM, get my money out, and just as I was about to head towards the shop a guy come up to me and says something like: hey man do u wanna buy a watch? He pulls out a fake rolex and says that he can make me a good deal. I say I'm not interested. The guy keeps following me asking if I got any friends who want to buy a watch. I say no. He asks me if I got a cigarette. I say no. Just as I'm about to enter the shop, he asks me if I can give him some money. Again, I say no. Just as I was entering the shop he said something like: ""cocksucker!"" I heard him, but I kept going. Now, why would I do that, you may ask? I didn't do it because it wasn't worth it getting in trouble with the police or face jailtime for assault. I did it, because even though I know I am capable of putting him in the hospital in 5 minutes, I was afraid. This version of myself knew that I could take him, but that skinny little kid I was years ago didn't. Somehow, that victim mentality from when I was a kid still stayed with me to this day. Like... it became a habit to run away from the trouble instead of dealing with it. 

So I go into the store and buy my food. On the way home, I realize what just happened, and I get angrier and angrier. I get home, put the food in the fridge and go back on the street to find the guy. I looked for him for half an hour... while fantasizing about his ribs cracking against my knuckles. About grabbing him by the neck and punch him and punch him and punch him and not stop until I see some blood. Unfortunately, I didn't find him. If only I had reacted the way I should have when he called me a cocksucker. But no, I hesitated, I kept going as if I deserved being insulted, as if I'm not worthy of respect. I wanna break that. I know that you'll probably say that fighting isn't good, or that it's not worth it. But I'd rather die fighting than living another day as a fucking victim. So, how do I stop forgetting who I am? How do I stop identifying with that version of myself from 6 years ago?

Over the last weeks I've made some significant changes in my life, and I really felt the need to share it with other people. I guess this is as much for me as for you, for me to hopefully end a period in my life and mark the beginning of another one. And I hope that by posting this, I can also inspire or help some of you guys who are struggling with the same things I've struggled with and still am.

I've been struggling with myself and my habits for a long, long time. It has never gotten out of hand completely; I still got out of the house for classes, did my (bare minimum of) homework, did volleyball 2x/week, hanging out with friends every now and then. However, every spare moment I would spend on the computer: mostly playing videogames, but also fair amounts of watching series or browsing the internet. I guess I can be happy that MMORPGs don't really appeal to me, I'm mostly a single-player gamer, constantly downloading new games, though rarely finishing a game because I got bored of most of them really fast.  
For a couple years, I've been denying to myself that I had a problem. Sure, I used to play video games a lot, but there were still times I didn't need to play at all. During the holidays, when I didn't have a laptop with me, I could read books whole days without any urge whatsoever. And when I was busy with other things or had a deadline coming, I had days that I didn't play and didn't miss it.  
However, when I had access and time to play, I did. It just became a habit for me, the thing I did whenever I didn't have anything to do at that moment. And I started procrastinating; I think I have an instinct for guessing how much time I need for certain tasks, so I would procrastinate up to the moment I had just enough time to finish it (though never enough to actually satisfy the perfectionist I do have in me). I started skirting the edge more and more, spending less time on my study, but I still got very high grades, so I didn't have any extra motivation there to change my ways.  
Of course I had nagging parents that kept saying every once in a while that I needed to stop procrastinating and that I was addicted to the computer. However, at first I didn't see it myself, so I didn't believe them and wanted to ignore it. And later, I did see it myself, but I couldn't talk to them about it; I thought they wouldn't understand; it felt too painful admitting I had a problem to them; I wanted to fix this myself and didn't want to rely on other people.  
After this had been going on for a couple years, I started realizing what it all did to me. I didn't play games or watched series anymore because it was fun or because I wanted to. It was just this routine I was getting into and I didn't know what to do else or how I could change. I really wanted to change by then, and tried several times, but always ended up back where I was before.

Until some months ago, when I started realizing some things about my problems and gradually making some lasting changes.  
I started with an internship, working 50+ hours/week. I really wasn't used to this, coming from 15-20 hours/week of lectures and classes. Most days, I was very tired, mentally and physically. I had to find new ways to reload and relax and didn't have time any more to waste it on things I didn't need.  
Because of this change, I started seeing my habits from a different perspective, how damaging they were to me, but I also saw why I still had to do them.  
- It was my way of coping with negative emotions or feelings. When I was playing a game or watching some series, I didn't need to think of anything else for some time and could pretend I didn't have any problems, even though I knew I had.  
- It was just easier; most of the things I wanted to do instead, would take some kind of effort or energy. The computer always gives instant gratification with minimal effort, so it takes much willpower to not give in.  
- I used the gaming to fill a void; whenever I had a spare moment, I was afraid to waste time, but if I finished a level or killed the next boss, it always felt like I achieved something.   

But I realized these weren't true:   
	- It might give me instant gratification, but after some time the guilt would come creeping up on me, and afterwards I would just feel bad about myself. However, if I would study or do other important stuff, I would feel genuinely good about myself and like I've accomplished something that day.  
	- Procrastinating didn't solve my negative emotions or make them disappear, all it did was add another layer of guilt that I couldn't do something better with my life, every day again. Which of course only added to the negative emotions and made it more important to flee from them, keeping the system going.  
	- Because it can only cause more negativity, it can never fill that void for me. For that I need genuine work, real things I've accomplished, connections with real people. Perhaps it's like throwing acid in a deep hole; it seems like you're filling it with something, but all it does is burn and make it deeper.

Over the years, I've tried many things and read a lot about these things, but it wasn't until now that I found a combination of changes that allowed me to keep them going and sustain them.  
- Meditation. For my birthday, I got a book about mindfulness. I was a bit sceptic at first, but I was still curious about what it could do for me. I did struggle a bit with my busy schedule to find time for meditation, but I'm glad I persisted. In the moment, it can be very relaxing, just focusing on your breath or body and to leave all your worries for some time. But in the long term, I noticed some other very big changes. I became much more aware of my thoughts and my urges, which is indispensable when you want to change and do what you need or want to do. And I also started noticing the world again: flocks of birds flying through the sky, the snow on my way to work, the sunset out of my window. I guess I got numb after all these years, and found my senses back. This was very important for me, in realizing what procrastinating did to me and how much better I feel, now that I've made these changes.  
	- A diary. More than 3 years ago, I already found that writing every day is something that I need to do. Back then, I was introduced to the concept of morning pages of Julia Cameron (summarized: as the first thing you do every morning, write by longhand for three pages, whatever is on your mind). I followed that a couple months and it helped me enormously in creating quietness in my mind, by getting all the random thoughts out of my head and allowing me to actually think them through. Since then I've failed at this habit many times because I simply forgot or got busy, but I also kept starting again because I found it's so valuable. I've written in different formats (writing longhand,  Word, 750words.com, [Penzu](http://www.penzu.com)), they have all their own strengths, weaknesses and appeals. Since a week now, I've started using OneNote again. But I guess this is really personal, and all you need is something that feels right to you and keeps you writing.  
	- Most Important Tasks (MIT). This is a concept I've learned from Zenhabits: every morning (or evening before you go to bed, if that suits you better) you pick the 1-3 tasks that are most important to you at that moment. Write them down somewhere (gives you extra motivation and accountability). At first, just start with doing it, even if it's just for 1 minute, before you start with anything else. Everyone can do that right? But by actually starting, you're making a start at beating your procrastination, and from there you can expand. Right now, I pick one or a few tasks every day, that I know I can complete. If I've done those, I can work on other things or relax, it doesn't matter, as I've already accomplished my day there, which is a great feeling.  
	- [Beeminder](http://beeminder.com). This is the one thing that has been the basis for all the other changes to succeed. Without this, I probably would have failed again just like all those times before. It's a great site for tracking all kinds of goals. It tracks your progress on a graph and forces you to keep moving toward your goal, otherwise you will fall off the road. You can adjust the steepness of the road at any time, so you can make it as hard or as easy as you want. The changes will only go into effect 7 days from now though, so that you can't weasel out of your commitment in the short term. It has integrations with various different services (GitHub, Withings, Trello, RescueTime, Gmail) and you can schedule daily reminders to mail or SMS if you want to. Their business model is that you commit to pay for their service if you derail from your goal (the first one is free, then it's just $5). However, as long as you stay on your road, everything is free. By just tracking and being accountable, I'm much more motivated every day to actually do the goals I wanted to do anyway (thanks to Beeminder I've written in my diary and meditated for 4 months now, done my MIT every day, started exercising more often and reduced my email inbox to zero from 1500+ emails). By starting slowly and with the extra motivation and accountability, you'll probably succeed anyway, but the actual money that is on the line adds another layer of motivation. And if you derail due to a technicality, you can just email them and they'll just reset your graph (their support is really great and personal, and they helped me a couple times when I had problems).  
	- [Trello](http://trello.com): here, you can easily make and organise lists. I started using Trello for keeping track of my To Do list, from which I can then just drag and drop a task to my MIT list, and from there I can then drag them to my Done list, which keeps growing and growing. I have even set up a goal in Beeminder, to automatically keep track the amount of MITs I completed.  
	- Change your unproductive routines. Every morning, I already started surfing or watching series before I completely went to the shower and got dressed, usually while eating my breakfast. By changing that up (getting dressed and ready before I breakfast, and adding in a short meditation), I already start the day with a more productive mind-set and the need for the internet fades away.   
	- Organise the bookmarks for websites you visit frequently in folders. I used to spend much time checking some sites again and again (e.g. Facebook, Gmail, Reddit, Feedly, Youtube, news sites). I realized some sites are very important for me (Trello, Beeminder, my online diary), so I put those together in one folder. By organising a few of the other sites in another folder (Gmail, Facebook, Feedly), I could just open that folder, look through them for something new, and then be done with them. In this way, I can create some moments during the day that I allow myself to check those sites, but reduce the need to go to those sites when I'm busy with something else. And by organising the remaining time wasters in another folder, I also reduce the temptation for visiting those. This doesn't seem like a big thing, but those little things can actually be a huge help.

A very important thing I've found: don't try to change too much all at once. Most diets fail because the people didn't make any lasting changes in their life, but they make some drastic temporary changes and then go back to their old ways and end up even fatter than before. Just like that, don't try to go cold turkey by banning all video games or TV or Facebook or whatever your vice is. You'll last a few days, maybe a few weeks or months, but you'll probably end up just like with a regular diet: back at square one.   
Instead, look at all those years those habits had to form and settle in your life. It's not realistic to be able to change them on a whim. Instead, take the time to change your life. Build other habits that will support you and nourish you. Try to take one step at a time. Pick one small thing to start with, something not too big or too hard, that you know you can do. If you managed to keep that habit going, maybe try expanding it a little more after 1-2 weeks. And then maybe try adding another habit, and another after that, just try to keep improving yourself. Maybe you won't see the results as quickly, but in this way you'll actually have a chance to succeed. And as long as you keep moving forward, you'll get there. Your future self will thank you, if you actually took the time to change and didn't try to rush it and fail miserably.

All this isn't to say that I'm perfect or anything. A couple weeks back I realized I hadn't actually played any games for some time and I realized I hadn't really missed it; in fact, I was more aware of all the negativity that it made me feel. So I decided to keep it that way and just do other things instead. However, those habits are very persistent, so I'm still struggling with Facebook or Reddit or watching series every now and then (and I have to admit I have played some games for a short time again), especially if I'm experiencing stress from something. However, I feel I have built a framework by now that keeps me on track and allows me to intervene if I'm going back hill again.

Well, that is what I found and realized during those years. I hope it isn't too incoherent or irrelevant, and sorry for the massive wall of text. It's great to get it off my chest though.   
If you've read all that (or some of it), I hope it will help you in some way or inspire you to try out some of the things that have helped me so far and will maybe work for you too.  
And if you have questions or comments, feel free to leave them here, I'll try to come back and answer them.


Tl;dr: don't try to change too much all at once, but take the time to change your habits step by step. Some things that have helped me so far: meditation, keeping a diary, picking a task to do every day, Beeminder and Trello.

Lots of people never discover what they truly want, so that is the first step. Even more people know what they want but don't know the path of how to get there. So the first step is finding what you want and what small goals you can do to achieve it. 

We all can't work constantly, so when you feel yourself getting too stressed from work take a break. When taking a break, instead of stimulating your mind with reddit or movies it is better to ether meditate or exercise. I believe meditation is absolutely vital to living a good life. I try to start off with a half hour of meditation each day. 

Socialization is also very important so I recommend going out and meeting potential sexual partners 2-3 times a week. Everyday we should seek to talk to those around us in a fun social way. 

These are my goals and life may work differently for other people. My current goal is financial independence which is quite a tall mountain to climb. However I study entrepreneurship and other interests for a large portion of my day. 

I do browse my subscribed reddits often, which is rather aimless. But there's some useful information. 

If you feel you need to hold on to r/all or video games or movies, that is fine and I sometimes do also. But you should only do these things during the end of your day after you have been working on your goals for 8 hours or so.

A rant to myself.",K80_k,89,17,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1iz2by/starting_to_feel_fed_up_with_myself_here_are_some/,"What will you regret more, missing something funny on the internet, or missing a beautiful sunset?

What will you regret more, not eating that bag of peanut M&amp;Ms or being able to wear a bikini confidently on the beach?

What will you regret more, a collection of ideas that never come to life, or a few solid things that I made myself?

My desk job is killing me, my physicality, my creativity (even though, in theory, I have a creative job, they aren't my ideas, my aesthetic). I decided a year or two ago that my life purpose was to make things and yet food is the only thing I have been making. I have all these dreams of making things and yet I go home and barely do anything. We watch movies together, and that's our together time? That isn't good enough. I want to see sunsets together. I want to stay in shape together so we can live our lives together for a long time. I want to paint, build, sketch, design and then MAKE IT. Ideas that stay in a notebook do nothing to change the world. Creativity is like anger, if you just keep it in it will rot. I feel like my creativity is rotten inside because I hardly ever MAKE the things I come up with. 

I make a lot of excuses, like we don't have space, or money, or I'm tired. This is bull shit. Limitations are the birthplace of creativity, so stop fucking fighting it or you really are a lazy person who gave up after a good run at college. No better than the high school quarterback who is still stuck in high school, you still dream of college where you did well in your classes, but now this is the real world. You have to work and that's never going to actually pay the bills and tap all your creativity. At least not yet. Stop lying to yourself that you are a certain kind of person, when, if you look at how you spend your day YOU ARE NOT BEING THE BEST YOU CAN BE. 

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired OF MYSELF. I make lots of plans of wanting to do something but don't always do it, unless it involved sitting on my ass. My endurance is never going to improve if I don't exercise, not just physically but also in actually doing things after work. I complain that I don't have enough friends well how often to I actually go out after work and try to make new friends? Never, that's the answer.

My boss already told me that one thing they look for in moving up is involvement in the community, so I need to get out of my safe little bubble of my apartment and get out there and do stuff. If I do what I love, I will eventually meet people who do the same thing and are interested in the same thing rather than just giving up and stating that there aren't people here like me. How would I know? I haven't even looked that hard (and searching the internet and meetup.com doesn't count as meeting people! And you aren't gonna get along amazingly with everyone you meet too! And that's ok!)

Ugh, I'm sick of myself. I need to stop listening to my brain and listen to my heart. It knows what I want and I keep thinking/excusing my way out of it.

TL;DR... Um, stop being a little bitch, self, stop making excuses or you will never be who you want to be. Also, think about what you REALLY want and what you will wish you had done 50 years from now. And put that fucking chocolate bar DOWN!

I also hope that these habits will stay with me well after summer but I think giving myself a set timeline is a good place to start. And for clarification I'm counting October 1st as the end of summer.

1) Get out of my credit card debt. I'll achieve this by:
*Making my own lunches every day
* Walking to and from the office every day instead of taking the bus
*No non essential clothes shopping (I'm saying non essential because I'm quite sporty and it might be I need some new sports clothes. Anything that's just trendy or fashion shopping is out)
*Buying my travel cards on a monthly basis instead of weekly 


2) Do Cardio 5 times a week. This can be either:
*Running
*Cycling
*Workout DVD


3)Read for an hour every day


4) Set my alarm for 5:45 every day and do not hit snooze. This will probably be the hardest because I am terrible and not hitting the snooze button. I want to be able to use the time in the morning to get my day organised, make my lunch, do some cardio, have a tidy in the flat.  This will also mean I have to go to bed earlier since I still would want to get my 7/8 hours sleep. 


5) Draw, doodle or sketch every day. I used to be constantly drawing or sketching and I never make time for it any more. Thats something I want to change. 

6)No soft drinks (soda) or Crisps (chips)

7) 20 minutes cleaning every day. Either at home or at work. (Doesn't include laundry or loading/unloading the dish washer)


I'm hoping that by October these habits will be second nature to me and I'll be able to do them without even thinking about it.

A short parable.,Thehealthygamer,85,17,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1bbl1o/how_do_you_eat_an_elephant_a_short_parable/,"[Link to original story](http://www.thehealthygamer.com/2013/03/29/how-do-you-eat-an-elephant/)

Many moons ago there lived a young warrior in a small mining village. He
dreamed of marrying the Chief’s daughter. Her beauty was legend across the
mountain villages.


Each year during the Spring Solstice the Chief would hold a banquet in her
honor and allow suitors to vie for her hand. And each year the great
warrior suitors would leave the banquet disappointed and confounded. For
the task which the Chief put them to was an impossible task. How does one
eat an Elephant?

Great warriors from across the land again gathered during the spring
solstice. The enormous pile of roast elephant sat all but ignored in favor
of more exotic delicacies as all the warriors had given up on the Chief’s
challenge many moons ago.

As the night wore on the Chief noticed that a young warrior had seated
himself next to the enormous pile of roast Elephant and was taking steady
determined bites. The dancing started, and still the young warrior ate. The
old men and women returned to their huts and still the young warrior ate.
The moon crossed the night sky and still the young warrior ate.

The next morning the Chief saw that the young warrior still sat at his
post, eating determinedly. Even though the young warrior had eaten through
night the pile of roast Elephant looked unchanged in size.

The aftermath of the banquet was cleared during the day and still the
young warrior continued eating. The Chief ordered that the roast Elephant
be left for the young warrior.

The young warrior ate through the day and the second night.

The next morning the Chief called for all of his villagers to gather around
the roast. “My good villagers, I have an announcement”, said the Chief in a
deep and resonate voice. “Today my daughter marries!”

The crowd hushed. “But no one ate the Elephant”, yelled one brave and
slightly intoxicated villager.

The Chief, with a sly smile upon his face, turned and pointed to the young
warrior who was still diligently attacking the roast. “Stand young warrior
and tell me: how do you eat an Elephant?”

The young warrior stood. His stomach visibly engorged. He took a deep
breath and then said in a proud and calm voice, “Chief, one bite at a
time.”

“My dear villagers, I never cared whether my daughter’s suitor could eat an
entire Elephant. I was looking for a special warrior who had the grit and
determination to tackle any problem, no matter the size. I wanted a warrior
who would never quit once he set his heart upon a goal. And today I have
found that warrior”, said the Chief.

——————————————————————————————–

I wrote this story to help illustrate for you one of life’s most important
lessons. Every task, large or small, must be tackled one bite at a time.
And with that attitude nothing in life is impossible.

Think about your health goal. Is it daunting to imagine all of the workouts
and nutrition changes you’ll have to make over your lifetime to reach your
ideal body? But what if you stopped focusing on the total task and instead
look at the very next bite. What is the one thing you must do today that
will bring you one step closer to your end goal? How difficult is it to go
to the gym ONCE? How difficult is it to eat well, ONCE?

We can only ever do one thing at a time. Remember that. And then let the
stress of all future events slide off of your shoulders. We will all reach
our goals, one bite at a time.

Take care and have a wonderful day,

These are all words that came to mind thinking about what I was doing with my life up until very recently. I'm not an unlucky man, I have a wife that I love, and who loves me in return. I have two amazing children, and we recently made the switch to me being a stay-at-home dad. Then I set into a depressive cycle. Wake up, internet, deal with the kids on an as-they-need-it basis, get things for my wife as she asks for them, with no thought going into planning for later today, nevermind tomorrow or next week. Things were going to a very bad place, and a week ago I resolved to change it.

I turned off my computer, and got off my ass and started changing things. Cooking a good breakfast for everyone, not rushing through the morning in a hurry to check my messages while prepping my daughter for school. We stopped fighting in the mornings. We had fun, we had time to have fun. 

I cleaned, like, scrubbed the kitchen. Our daughters bathroom. The dining room and living room. That ever-growing pile of stuff on the table, the one that everyone contributes to until you're sitting on the sofa eating dinner looking at it like it's Mt. Doom? Done, gone. Cleaned.

I did six loads of laundry, I re-hung pictures that were sitting around from when we moved. I sorted all the mail that had been accumulating for a month. Everything flat got vacuumed, then I cleaned the vacuum too. I sorted our sons toys to see what we could ditch because his pile o' fun was spreading across the room.

Then it was 2:05, time to get our daughter off the bus.


And that trend has continued each day, getting more done with each one as I hit my stride with getting things done around here. I've been to the gym three times this last week, with an accountability partner. We're eating better because menus are getting planned out, and shopping gets done ahead of time. 

So thank you /r/GetDisciplined, I honestly don't think I could have accomplished this without you and your success stories. 

Keep being awesome.

edit: Now that I've woken up all the way and had some time to reflect, I think it all comes down to the fact that you can't force change. You can have external motivators, you can have goals, but you have to accept that change is difficult.

The motivation to change does not come in a can. It will never see print on a witty poster. You have to own it, do it, be it.

It will not be as hard as you have built it up to be. I know that someone is reading this right now, on the cusp of doing something to better to themselves, and to that person I would like to say:

- Music, loud and fast, helps me concentrate. Today it was Azealia Banks' mixtape.

- Lists. Colour coded that shit. Bought a rainbow of highlighters.

- Using the EpicWin app as a neat little reward system.

To stay focused and disciplines when trying to reach your goals, write down a Mantra for yourself and read it every single day until your dreams become your reality.",daveybaby32,75,10,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1iwl8g/ive_found_something_that_really_keeps_me_going/,"So I posted on this sub about a month and a half ago about trying to stay disciplined as I study for my MCAT for the next 3 months. It's been a bumpy road thus far, I have just over a month left and there have been good days and bad days. 

One night I thought I was never going to make it and I was planning on postponing my exam. I went on the Pre-med subreddit asking for advice and some guy was like, ""I wouldn't take the exam if I were you."" I'm sure that the guy was really trying to help but being told I should wait longer because I didn't have enough time to accomplish my goal made me furious, and unleashed a lot of pent up anger and disappointment I had in myself. 

It was about 1:00am when this happened and I couldn't sleep because I was so angry, not just about what the guy said to me but about my entire situation as a whole. I hopped out of bed and just lashed out. I responded to him on reddit saying there was no way I was gonna postpone and that I had enough time to do what I wanted to do because I was the one in control of the situation and was going to make sure I got the job done. 

I then did something I've never done before, I was so determined at that point to succeed and be proud of myself that I wanted to spend the rest of the night buried in my studies, but I knew it was in my best interests to get some sleep because I had to be up early the next morning, so I decided to channel all I was feelings into a letter to myself, since I knew that the inspiration I was feeling would be gone by the morning.

I took to a Word document and in about five minutes was 3 pages deep into a letter that I poured my feelings into. I told myself about how years of failures and weak attempts had lead to this point and that I could reverse it all by acing this exam. I outlined how all I want at this point in my life is to get into med school and that the only person standing in my way was myself. I urged myself that nothing was worth not doing the work I needed to do and that although everyone I know has said that med school is a pipe dream for me, that nailing the MCAT would be the biggest fuck you to everyone who didn't have my back and that it would be the greatest feeling ever to shove my successes in the faces of the naysayers, not to mention I would finally become someone my parents could be proud of and more importantly someone I could be proud of. 

I ended off that letter stating that 42 days separated me and the MCAT that could more or less decide the rest of my life and that how I chose to spend those 42 days was up to me. I saved the file as a PDF and put it on every single one of my electronic devices; my phone, my iPad, my laptop, everything.

Every day since then I wake up and read that letter to myself and it reminds me exactly how I felt that night when some stranger on the Internet told me I wasn't good enough to meet the goal I set for myself and I remember all the feelings I had when he told me this. That sets up my day to use it to its full potential and whenever I have any doubts in myself I just go back and read that letter I wrote to myself and all my doubts quickly go away.

I write my MCAT on August 28th and I plan on reading that letter over 100 more times between now and then in order to ensure my success.

I encourage anyone else struggling to reach a goal to do the same thing and write down their mantra with their motivations and goals and then read it every single time they feel like they won't get the job done. I promise you nothing is more satisfying than remembering why you're doing what you're doing. If I end up getting the score I want on the MCAT, I will have absolutely no doubt in my mind that I did it because I wrote that letter to myself and read it every day and that without it I would not have had the same success.

**EDIT: By popular demand I've decided to upload parts of what I wrote. I had to cover up parts that were personal to me as well as names I mentioned, but I think it's still very readable. I also highlighted a sentence I wrote that I really liked the next morning when I read it. There are obvious grammatical errors but give me a break, it was very late, and I think the errors give the overall product a bit of moxie.**

**Also there is a bit of vulgarity, I was pretty fuelled up when I was writing it so I swore quite a bit. Lastly when I think to myself I act as if I'm speaking to myself which may explain all the second person dialogue you're about to see.**

1370933271.0,63,self.getdisciplined,1g3u6e,A Theory About Success and How to Achieve It,WAMF,80,17,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1g3u6e/a_theory_about_success_and_how_to_achieve_it/,"OK, bear with me here.  I’m making quite a few generalizations but I’d like to test this theory out.  I don’t know if this idea has been put forward before, but I just had an epiphany tonight and had to put this into words.

Becoming successful is a war of attrition which can take years to win:

Lets pretend that “success” can be a purely-objective quality that describes your overall life, and can be characterized by factors which we have control over such as:

-	Overall attitude, happiness, lack of stress, etc

-	Health/Fitness level

-	Having meaningful friendships/relationships (quality over quantity here)

-	Financial stability/security and economic freedom (not to be confused with wealth)

-	Overall intelligence/knowledge

Now, regardless of what social/economic class you were born into, none of us are guaranteed to be successful, according to the criteria listed above.  Even if you enter this world under the best of circumstances (wealthy family, no genetic problems, good parents, high IQ, etc), you are not going to be successful without striving to be the best person you can be.  For example, even if your parents are nurturing and rich, this won’t necessarily make you healthy or stress-free.  External factors can only go so far in shaping you; thus it’s ultimately up to you to make yourself happy, build quality relationships, stay in shape, manage your money, and learn to be a better person.
	
Since none of us are born successful, we must maintain a state of self-improvement until we are.  I know it sounds basic, but in my opinion, here’s where most people get it wrong:  As soon as we start doing well, we have a tendency to become complacent and stop improving ourselves before we realize our full potential.  As an example, many of the “popular” kids in my high school never really went anywhere in life after graduating.  The “hot girls” and “jocks” mostly just went to mediocre colleges for meaningless degrees, since they had already become content with their status as the “cool kids.”  Unfortunately, it’s not just the top of our adolescent society that burns out, but rather the overwhelming majority.  The middle and lower classes are largely made up of people who haven’t realized their full potential, since they peak at such a young age and become complacent. 
	

As an alternative to this, I’m going to use myself as an example.  I’ll try to be as objective as I can, but I apologize in advance if I seem to be bragging.  All through grade school, I was a nobody.  Even though I was at the top of my class academically, I was scrawny, shy, and had very few people I could call friends.  Most of my free time was spent buried in books, and I was a constant subject of ridicule in the classroom.  However, as I entered into high school, something changed.  I had watched my parents struggle with finances and careers that were far below their intelligence level, and as much as I love them, I desperately didn’t want to end up like them, as a mediocre member of the proletariat, subject to the whims of an incompetent employer.  Furthermore, I was tired of being unhappy with myself.  My grades had always been good, but as stated before, I was physically weak and socially awkward.  In a misguided attempt to become “cool,” I joined the track team, since it was one of the few sports that you didn’t have to try out for.  Even though I was by far the slowest kid on the team (during freshman year) and it never made me “cool,” that was where I met others like me and made my first real friends since childhood.  I worked hard through high school, and was eventually accepted into a military academy during my senior year (basically its four years of regimented “college” followed by a commission at graduation as an officer, all paid for by Uncle Sam).  My parents couldn’t afford to send me to a good college, and I was unwilling to bury myself in student debt.  As an added bonus, I was guaranteed an awesome job as a military officer after graduation.

Now, only a few years out of high school, I can honestly say I’m living the dream.  I’ve become financially self-sufficient and independent of my family, I have no debt, and I have a guaranteed career (doing awesome stuff, nonetheless) for the forseeable future.  I’ve got a fantastic group of trustworthy friends (both in and out of the military), I’m in the best shape of my life (and still improving), and most importantly, I have eliminated almost all stress from my life by focusing on things that are:

A)	Important

B)	Under my control

…and “tuning out” what isn’t.  Am I perfect?  Of course not.  I’m still embarrassingly awful with women and I can be extremely passive at times, but for the most part I’m on my way to success.

IN CONCLUSION:
What I’ve come to realize is that it’s not really all that important how well you’re doing or who you are, but rather that you’re headed in the right direction and constantly improving yourself.  Do not worry about who you are today; instead focus on what/who you want to be ten years from now.  Achieving true success takes a long time, and it can be difficult to maintain vigilance over the years.  It’s easy to give up and become complacent, but this is exactly what will doom us to mediocrity.  The way to succeed in our society is to maintain a long-term positive attitude and keep improving yourself and your life even after your peers have peaked and begun to settle down.  

TL;DR:  Slow and steady wins the race

For the majority of my childhood and early adulthood family, authority figures, and even some ""friends"" have reinforced the idea that unless whatever I do benefits someone else, it's a waste of time. As such, I've spent the last 30-odd years looking elsewhere for approval and have walked away from many of the hobbies and interests that I was passionate about because it didn't help someone else with their immediate, short-term needs. I've been married, had children, and subsequently divorced because the person I was with was tired of being with someone who focused solely on making other people happy at the expense of his own happiness (there were other reasons too, but that was a major one).

I used to draw, write, design. I had a wellspring of ideas that it was often hard for me to choose which project I wanted to do first - but then someone else would need me to help them move, or whomever I was dating would be going through a ""hard time"", a family member would be put into crisis, and I would set it aside. Additionally, if I ever did post something I had made in a forum where it would be viewed, no one would comment on it. I now know that outside confirmation is the last thing you need if you want to feel better about yourself, but I had (and still am) so used to getting other people's approval for the things that make them happy that I still seek it out.

Now I look around at the multitude of projects that are all half-finished lying around me. But when I think about pursuing one of them I think ""What's the point? No one is going to read/see/like it. It's a waste of time."" And I don't know how to get out of this rut of thinking. Lately It's been hard for me to be motivated about anything that used to make me happy because I can't think of any long-term goal that's important enough (again, because I'm used to weighing how it would benefit those around me.)

What do you think? I found this statement to be incredibly liberating.  My childhood was spent being told ""do it well, or don't bother"", ""start what you finish"" and so forth. Realising that not every task needed to be completed perfectly makes beginning the task so much easier for me. 

I can start what seems to be an overwhelming task, with the understanding that I will do five (10, 20) minutes, then stop. I can sweep or vacuum the floors without moving the furniture. I can do half a job (and come back to it later!) No matter what, I have achieved more than if I'd continued to procrastinate and done nothing.

I was reading about a [vampire grad student](https://chronicle.com/article/The-Case-of-the-Vampire/139099/), and holy shit, I realized that that was basically me. I dragged everybody down in my shit because I was too short sighted to realize a little something something: holy shit, I  am in control of my life. All of my shortcomings and successes are because of my decisions. I mean, shit. All of the hard times that I've gone through were because *I* decided to be miserable, and likewise, all of my happy times were because I decided to be happy. Now, I am not belittling depression or similar feelings. If you're depressed, seek out medical help. Once that junk is sorted out, make the choice to be productive. To go out and be happy. To change the world. I am writing this from a greyhound station on my way to what is currently my dream job and into what will be the best summer yet ( and I used to hate summer so much because of how lonely and depressed I felt) all to a small decision on my part to send out emails and see what summer positions were available at my university. That email, 1 paragraph long, helped change my life around. It's all about baby steps, but it's the first step that matters the most. This post has been years in the making, and I am not doing my progress any justice whatsoever. I am so damn happy that I am making my own decisions--I'm in charge of my life, and most importantly, my happiness. You cannot control how other people will perceive or judge you, but you can very much control what you present to the world. Make today your best day yet. I love you all, you janky ass thugs. You've been amazing, inspirational, and thought-provoking, and it has been my pleasure to be a part of this community.

I really dig this subreddit, it's one of my favourites, and I feel a particular kinship with other people who frequent here. Something just occurred to me.

I'm currently engaged in a week-by-week project where I'm setting certain goals focusing on regular health-maintenance and regular talent-development (writing).

I've arrived at the 10 day mark. I usually crack sooner, until I realized this: Discipline is only as necessary as your dissatisfaction with the status quo is present. Probably an enormously undersung factor in the game of getting disciplined is how desperate you are to escape your own life.

Are you? How frantically are you trying to change things? How often do you suppose deep, powerful, long-lasting changes occur under frantic conditinos? I don't think many.

Success stories seem to come exclusively from people who say ""Yeah... I was just doing this, and that was fun. And then it grew and now I'm doing this, and it's even more fun.""

So I'm not going to badger on anymore, here's the:

TLDR: You only need as much discipline as you are desperate to escape your life. You can get great leverage in your ability to affect your life, by integrating yourself into it instead of trying to eject from it. The more you can relax into your own life, the more you'll be able to  create whatever it is your are disciplining yourself to achieve.

My dad left a long time ago. I dropped out of highschool when I was younger and we moved back to our home country, where we were considered foreigners. I faked a college diploma to get jobs here and there but I didn't have the discipline to stick to anything. I stupidly thought getting on medication would solve all my problems and went on effexor, for only 3 months but the withdrawals, i think I still have it somewhat even after years. 

I thought I was very smart- I am, but not as much as I would like to believe. I huffed and puffed, saved just enough money for a flight ticket back to where I was schooled and obssesively got high grades. It was so stressful that I ruined health. I had just four months to graduate highschool, and get the GPA required to apply to my choice of university. My math, physics, chem, and bio scores are all perfect. But because I was in a dark place at the time, the state university still rejected me without any reason other than that they didn't like my writing. Now I'm back in my home country with my mom. I'm too ambitious and greedy to give up and just go to a trade school, but I feel that my time to go to uni is running out. I'm thinking of applying next year again, or go to a community college. If I don't go to community college right now, I would spend the next year self studying AP's and working. 

I feel too old to start anything, I feel too stupid that I wasted my youth.  A classic mistake of no self discipline but some talent. I don't know if I should pursue my uni dreams in science (pharmacology) or just give up and go to a trade school to make money. If I go to the community school, I don't think it's likely that I'll be able to transfer out to my target school. I spend most of my time obsessively worrying about something or completely wasting my time. When I set goals, I feel so pressured by the ordeal that I quickly cave in- maybe I am just weak but when I push through that stress, I get skin disorders from the stress- I don't think its merely just that I am weak. I hope that someone can relate to my situation as a 22 year old loser who was too smart for his own good, deserting society thinking he was a hot-shot and being stomped down by his past. 

But today was a special moment for me. I had always searched for a reason to be relaxed or a reason to be worried- but another thought came through. I decided to stop searching for reasons- when I would set goals I would tell myself that I had a reason to be anxious so I would worry and it would all go downhill from there. But I realized that even though my uni had rejected me and everything is back to base 1, I am still nervous. I realized that I have to CHOOSE to BE. I have to actively BE what I want.

I told myself ""BE realxed, therefor FEEL relaxed, therefor I KNOW I am relaxed, I am relaxed."" I tricked my mind's obssessive want for reason onto itself. I can't wait or find something or someone to SAVE ME- that's just a figment of my imagination that I had created way into the future- that will NEVER COME BECAUSE THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS. I have to, this instant, BE, thus FEEL, thus KNOW. I repeated this mantra for a couple hours in my head and for the first time in years I feel a sense of difference and see a light at the end of the tunnel. 

Going to uni or becoming successful will not give me the reasons to be happy or relaxed, I have to be relaxed and happy this instant to be successful. I can't have all this weight on my shoulders of my past mistakes, I have to free myself now to be successful at anything.

I'm not sure how long this will go on, but I think its working even though I figured it out just today.

It might sound a bit ridiculous to you, but tip of the week number four is...

Tip of the week (#4)- turn the everyday into an art form.

The next time you do dishes, I want you to try something. Try to carry out the chore with absolute precision. Clean each glass for exactly thirty seconds. arrange the cups precisely, or in a pattern, onto your towel. Dry each plate meticulously, ensuring there isn't a drop of water on anything. Put everything away without making a single sound. It's like therapy. It is amazing how involved you can get into such a ridiculous little thing, and how nice you feel afterwards.

Try to live an entire day perfectly. Wake up, make your bed extremely neat. Pay perfect attention in class, or do perfect work at work. Make simple things like making coffee so neat and precise. Try to do everything as a samurai would, with the total purity of each tiny activity his number one priority, as if nothing else matters.

its some zen shit, but it works. At the very least, it can make tasks seem to go by faster, or make them more enjoyable. Give it a shot. It can be a really surreal thing.

* Reading for Pleasure—60 minutes/day.
* Do something creative: 30 minutes/every other day. This will be either learning piano, dancing, or doing an art project. (I used to dance, and I want to learn to paint.)

- Its not unusual for me to work 8-12 hours in a day (when it gets really crazy 15 hour work days) this stress really piles up and without friends and people to relax with Ive been turning to alcohol. 

- With family connections Ive been able to house my business rent free and with relatively little overhead in exchange for favors and providing servies to the owners. 

- my discipline is terrible, I often let myself and others down for stupid short-sighted reasons. I tell myself, today is the day im going to go out and do sales, but when time comes to do it i find an excuse. I dont have a foundation of constructive habits, like getting up on time is difficult every morning. 

I really want to grow my business and achieve independence for myself (have the resources to live on my own and not be dependent on family connections to sustain my business)  because I know the current situation is unsustainable, sooner or later one of the many things i depend on will fail and I dont want everything I've worked for to come tumbling down with it. 

Right now the pain of my loneliness and the stress i feel from pushing it 110% is more real than the pain of losing everything I've worked for. How can I make the latter more real, more painful? How can I make the idea of achieving independence more pleasurable? like I say to myself ""oh I could go out and work super hard and earn more money but I dont really need more money, what i want is to not feel alone, get laid and laugh""

I've made a list of about how many customers I would need to earn in order to have some basic independence (food, rent, entertainment, warehouse) and i think its the step in the right directions but it hasn't worked 100%

I want to make it clear that I am extraordinary grateful for the situation I am in and realize how lucky I am to have the wonderful people in my life who made this possible, I just need some help learning how to take full advantage of this situation.

It is really taking my life down the shitter. I'm in my final year of college, and this is by far my worst qtr. yet because I am not doing well at all. My mind is just not there. I try very hard to get myself back to where I used to be, but everything is different now, and i'm having a very hard time getting in the right state of mind again. I think this all changed when I found out my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer last year. I felt hopeless and alone because I couldn't be there with my family. They were able to remove it, she recovered,  and she's doing well now, but I don't think I ever recovered. My mindset changed to something I can't even figure out, and my habits changed to something that is very self destructive. 

I think I lost my belief, i'm not talking about god, i'm just talking about believing myself when it comes to studying. One bad grade just tells me that I am not good enough, and this is resulting in me failing my classes. It's like a chain reaction, when one bad thing happens, 10 bad things follow, until I want realize what is going on, then I'll decide to change something and then same process repeats. 

What I want is to just simplify my life and not have all this shit going on in my head. What i'm looking for is to just get rid of all these thoughts in my head and just have my brain get in a habit where I just do work when work needs to be done, regardless of what the outcome is. I suppose just focus on my work, and be strong enough to not let my failures result in destruction of my life.

________________________________________________________________________________________________

Ok. Almost two weeks of listening nature wille studying and I have to say that I cannot think in a better way of relaxing and concentrating with sound. Anyways I want to share some things about this subject that I had discovered:

 First, I have to say that after 2 weeks of listening to different ""nature music"" sources I am kind of disappointed with the majority of them... The point of listening to this kind of stereo recordings (at least for me) is that you don't really have a repetitive or predictable sound (as could be music) so your head cannot be distracted wille letting itself flow with the music and predicting the rhythm, chords or lyrics. You don't think about the meaning of the lyrics, you don't start moving your foot by the rhythm, and you don't think things like ""wow, how good is this bass player ffs!"". There are other benefits that I can get from ""nature music"": the best recordings get you a feeling of deepness and texture, they take you to some other (calm) dimension where you really can focus and, (hopefully) they reproduce a great range of sound frequencies that go trough deeb bass (like storm and waves), mid frequency (like some animal sounds or water flowing) and get till the clear high frequency of the birds song. Some of them even have a permanent white relaxing noise as can be the sound of the rain. This range of frequencies actually give your mind a sort of an all-rounded massage while neutralizing other ambient noises from your working place. The problem I found here was:

- The majority of the free ""nature music"" sources from internet **are not HD stereo recordings**... Unfortunattley many of them are not even recordings! 
- Many are just a **3 minute track repeated 20 times** (that makes you know the recording and, after a while, you are just extremely annoyed by some stupid bird that you noticed and that repeats the same exact sound every 3 minutes).
- Other are just **a computer program that generates aleatory nature sounds**. This one makes me feel frustrated, as you quickly find a mechanic repetition of a sound, and you start to feel that every bird or raindrop is just the same as in the previous 10 seconds... and once you have noticed it, you just have to stop the track.
- Finally some of the real 1h stereo recordings **just don't have the quality you would want** to reach that natural range of frecuencys that would let you enjoy the nature and be so damn relaxed...

With a little more research I found that there's some people (usually sound tech pros or some kind of wild life professionals) that really make an effort to record **real HQ nature stereo recordings** that have a wide range of frequencies and dont repeat a sound for the entire track. THOSE ARE MY HEROES! 
But has any professional good work, those ones are not shared for free... I found that there is an entire community of sites and blogs from people that make this amazing recordings and sell them to you (usually around 10$ an hour of music). As I am just getting to know this new world I don't have too much to say about it right now. Just that I am amazed by the range of geographic locations, and the HD perfection of some of the previews. Now I am about to buy my first 10$ (for 70min) recording of an African safari, and I would be pleased to give you some feedback after listening

Lastly here you have some good links as an example of the job of this quality ""nature music"" recorders, please tell me if you know more:

Now, I like being inspired as much as the next guy, but to really develop self discipline you need to address the underlying problem. The problem, put quite simply, is that your brain does not want you get disciplined. Millions of years of evolution have given you a brain that rewards laziness and places great importance on automatic behaviors. Furtively, we probably all already know that fixing our procrastination problems and getting motivated will not be as easy as getting inspired and then, almost miraculously, summoning up that secret wellspring of willpower we have kept buried inside us. If it was that simple, you would have already done it.  

If you really want to make a change then start small. Do one thing every day for sixty-six  days (some studies have come out to show this is the time it takes to make something into a habit) that you know you will be able to do. It could be as simple as not eating potato chips or doing light exercise. Heck, if you are really having trouble and are not used to having a schedule, then that thing could even be just brushing your teeth twice a day. But whatever it is you choose to do, make sure to do it diligently and not let up. Start with something stupid and easy but stick to it. Once you get used to being able to do something on a daily basis and actually follow through, you can then pick something a little more challenging to tackle. Now, developing one good habit every sixty-six days may seem slow at the moment, but developing self-discipline is not something that can happen overnight. Some people live their entire lives as slaves to their bad habits whilst searching for a quick and easy solution. Don't look for shortcuts and don't believe the snake oil salesman armed with cute quotes and empty advice. Inspiration is never a substitute for methodical, hard work and patience.

Surfing net like a mindless zombie and destroying the wonderful abilities of the brain sucks. Internet is a huge forest of temptations that suck us in. Our brains are increasingly getting more addicted to the dopamine rushes of discovering more and more novel stuff on the internet. 

Let's kick off this challenge and get back the possession of our wonderful minds.

Some Rules :

1) No mindless browsing.

2) Only creative use of the internet.

If you need to get work done and need to use the internet, it's all right.

If you are nofap, you can get support at /r/nofap.

Similarly, /r/StopGaming is cool if you are recovering from a gaming addiction.

Just keep your guards up and do not let internet browsing be mindless. Then it spirals into an uncontrollable addiction. Be mindful on purpose.

I grew up as a spoiled child and at the age of 19 I still didn't know how to cook, fold a shirt, or do ANYTHING. I've tried so many techniques, and they always work for a while.

My bursts of discipline coincide with life events. My mother was put into a psychiatric ward (Crazy house) about 2 years ago which brought my first round of self discipline.

 I was biking to class (20 miles there and back) running three miles a day, showing up to every class, making all A's, and being extremely organized and positive.

Then I got a boyfriend, and quit it all. My mother went back to the ward and I became self disciplined again for another two months. Got another boyfriend, and quit it all. (Well there's a pattern!) 

Then this previous year I started again, but more slowly. Cut out Dr. Peppers, started yoga and running, but this past couple of weeks have fallen to crap again. First it was midterms, and then I went to visit my parents back home and for some reason just let myself go. It started off with one dr. pepper, which I find fine every once and a while. Then it moved on to one a day for three days. I ran maybe twice and didn't do yoga at all. I can feel myself slipping and it's been long enough that it isn't just ""Oh, I had a little bit of time off"" and now I am completely unmotivated. 

To me it seems that I cannot be in a relationship without forgetting completely about myself. Every time I go through these motivated periods I isolate myself from nearly everyone, as that seems the only way I know how to do it.

Demon Days by the Gorillaz has been one of my favorite albums since its release in 2005. There have been few constants in my life since then, and that includes music. To this day, I still listen to this album on a regular basis. The album was a formative part of my independence once I moved out of my house, and listening to the album brings back a number of memories from a good portion of my life. That being said, know so very little about the album. I know a good number of the lyrics, but not enough to understand the messages of the songs.   

The more I listen to this album that I’ve heard a couple of hundred times, I am hearing things I have never noticed before. I can audibly notice the bass. I pick up on the orientation of certain parts of the music. I am just now noticing the subtleties of the album. This struck me like a brick. I love this album. How can I know so little about it? This reminded me of a list I made a few years back when I was convinced that my life was in music. This list contained a handful of albums that I had marked to study and learn about. Of these eight albums, I may have watched a making of video about one of them. I’m sure if I went back to each of these albums, I would find similar subtle touches that I haven’t noticed yet.   

That list was made solely for the purpose of me learning more about something that I loved. This, however, didn’t stop the list from being abandoned. There is no reason why there were abandoned, at least none that I can remember now. I can only assume that the list was buried under something more fun or relevant at the time and was ever recovered. There is a folder of such lists on my hard drive. One contains recipes I have meant to find and try. Another a list of piano songs I were to learn once I got a keyboard and learned to play. The keyboard sits under a growing layer of dust in what we call the “junk room” now. My drumset is there as well.  

Somewhere along the line, after enthusiasm runs out and that initial burst of creative energy circles the bend, I am often left to brush lists and goals under a large imaginary rug. After working on organizing my life a bit, I have finally found a number of these lists, and I am ashamed that I so many are still relevant and unfinished. I still wish to try to write a list of rules to follow in order to survive a horror movie. I started on that project over 3 years ago and have yet to break a single page.  

I know I am not the only person with this issue. Gym memberships go through the roof during January, and by March, their clientele has paid out whatever contract was signed, if any, and stopped coming altogether. I have worked customer service for the past 4 years, and a good number of people I speak to  simply refuse to take responsibility for their actions. There I so little accountability in our personal lives that these slack standards have made their way into our public lives.  

We, as a population, have largely lost our sense of responsibility. We sign contracts without reading them; we always assume that someone else screwed up. We scoff in line at Starbucks when we are made late by a long line when we could have easily left an extra ten minutes early to get our Frappuccino. Truthfully, it is an easy task to assign something that is more important ahead of something that seems trivial. I will admit, my financial stability and safety is not dependent on me writing a book making fun or horror movies. That isn’t the point. I said I was going to do something and I haven’t done it. We all do this, every day.  

The new year is only ten days old, and I would be willing to bet that, already, someone has given up on a resolution or a goal they have set for themselves. It certainly is hard to lose weight. It’s hard to trade bad habits that make our lives convenient for good ones that will, in time, enrich our lives. Among all the goals on many people’s list this year, they have all forgotten the most important goal: Be more accountable for your actions. Even a little progress on this one goal will nurture every other action in your life.

I feel like my life is taken away by small things that I do. Checking reddit 20 times per day for 3 minutes each; facebook, newspaper, one fast article in online newspaper, one fast comment and I'm gone!Actually I have now even problems with finding time for one whole movie; spending 90 minutes? I don't kow if I have that amount of time! I'd rather watch 5 20-minute tv sitcoms, and browse internet. I feel like that if I dropped those small things that I could do so much more stuff done.

I decided to make myself a challenge - whatever I will do, I won't spend less than 20 minutes on it. Anything smaller than 20 minutes should be dropped - I am fine with even 5 20-minutes session, and if they are terrible, then I will force myself for those 20 minutes, so that I won't want to go there again until there will be new content.

When using pc I'll use focusbooster, as it's program I often use as a way to force pomodoro technique on myself. When I'm outside of pc, it will be much easier; I don't think I'll use just simple watch.

I've made a list of things that I'd love to do, and I am not doing because I cannot spare 20+ minutes in one session.

* I've got several books on kindle waiting to be done;
* I should stretch and run a little more often;
* I gave up go\baduk, because I could not spend 1,5 hour+
* I am spending 5 minutes daily on duolingo, and more time would be better
* And some personal stuff

I have lived my life so far without putting all that much effort into anything. Partly it is because I have not needed to, but recently I have been slowly realizing that I really do. The more I think about it, the more I realize that I simply have not had any experience working extremely hard at anything. The more I think about it, the more I realize that this has caused a lot of fuck ups and has really affected my life.

For example, I love music. Playing it, making it, whatever. But a few years ago I stopped taking the piano lessons I had been taking since I was 6. Not because I don't like it, but because I just wasn't practicing enough. Pieces that I would honestly be able to master in a week if I truly applied myself would take months for me to play them well enough for my teacher to think it was good enough to move on, and I realized that I was just wasting his time. 

In elementary/high school I could easily breeze through anything that I could finish in class, however any sort of homework was excruciatingly difficult to accomplish. Even though I knew that it's less work to just do it now than 2 weeks after the due date while thinking about how awful of a person  I am for not being able to do it the whole time. I don't want to bore you with the details but suffice it to say that there has been a lot of time wasted, despite my high grades. I'm now planning on going to university but I just don't see it working out if I don't change something fundamental to my core being.

This might just seem like a procrastination problem but it is more than that. Even when I finally 'get down' to dealing with what I need to do it is like my brain just shuts down after a while and then I'm done for the day. It doesn't matter if it is doing something that I really want to do or if it is something I *just* “need” to do. So even after I have pushed through the procrastination itself, I will end up stopping after a few hours at the most, even if there is no reason to do so. I'd really like to learn to draw, and I know the only way to get better at it is to actually draw, but watching tutorials on Youtube of people drawing better than me is a lot less work, so that is what ends up happening.

I'd love to spend literally all day single mindedly focused on doing something, and I have the opportunities, but I'm just incapable. Yet I know that is the only way.

Recently I have been genuinely trying to improve myself, but no matter what it is like I just can't put any 'real' effort to get down and dirty with anything. Also, writing down lists, goals, rules, plans, whatever, it just never works because I just ignore them. For example, I had set up a deadline (July 1st) for a personal project I wanted to accomplish that was definitely within my abilities, but I just... didn't do it. And still haven't done it. I did work on it, but only enough to do a fraction I can spend great deals of time thinking about all the things I would do to accomplish it, how great it would be and so on, but it just never happened.

Yesterday I had 2 goals written down that I wanted to accomplish. One was to spend 0 to 30 minutes on Reddit the whole day (I basically use it as a second Google or Wikipedia, hah), and another was to spend exactly 1 hour organizing the files on my computer. That's it. No other responsibilities, nothing.  That day I woke up with a bad headache that lasted a long time, so obviously I used that as an excuse to not organize. A terrible one, considering it was bearable when sitting still without moving my head, which was all that was required of me in the first place. What makes this worse is that the headache went away halfway through the day, yet I still was using it as an excuse. 2 or more hours on Reddit, 0 organizing. I don't even fucking like Reddit. 

Pep talks, motivational speeches, sound bites and slogans like ""Just do it^tm"" don't do anything for me. I might get pumped up enough to think ""Yeah yeah I can do this"" but it only lasts a few minutes, not enough to do anything useful. Writing this out is making me feel real pathetic, useless and worthless. At least I'm actually accomplishing one of today's goals, for once. 

TL;DR: Lazy, no discipline, horrible work ethic, so much so that I  can't even do the things I want, let alone the things I need.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1htfmw,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1htfmw/how_to_work_hard/,

I want to lose weight. I need to stop eating bad food but I always convince myself ""Just one more day. Tomorrow, I'll start tomorrow."" And no more than two or three days later I cheat (but before I do, I convince myself again that tomorrow will be the day, not today, today I should cheat, tomorrow I wont.) 

My parents never explained to me how to find problems in your own life, and fix them. I've been clueless on how to fix problems in my life but I kept trying, kept trying to find problems and trying solutions until something worked. That's worked out really well, except for losing weight. 

I don't have patience, and I can't stand doing the same thing and not getting the result I was hoping. Funny thing is though that I don't know what result to expect, but I end up not sticking to any diet or exercise regime. 

I know that if I continue these habits, I will suffer. I know this, but it's so hard to grasp of this concept when I can just do it tomorrow! I've convince myself that one day won't hurt, and with that logic, I turn back into a sloth. 

There was only one time in my life I started to lose weight successfully. I convinced myself that if I lose weight, I would have sex with this guy I liked. There was no agreement between me and him, I just tried to fool myself *mentally* that this would be my reward if I start to lose weight. Sex was an excellent motivator, I could have climbed mountains if I knew there was going to be some dry humping at the top! The drawback was that I fell in love with the dude. The amount of times I had to remind myself not to cheat on my diet was extensive. And I had to remind myself of the rewards of sex constantly for motivation. **Damn it, this worked!** I lost **80 lbs**. Can you guess what happened next? He ended up moving, and I gained all of my weight right back, like a yoyo. 

I realized not to do that again based on two reasons. One, falling in love with someone who can't express the love back will eat you up inside. And two, maybe my motivation shouldn't be about sex? It should be about me and my health. But somehow, that isn't enough.

1347301209.0,54,self.getdisciplined,znx18,I've thought of a new self-discipline/productivity tool and I want you guys to critique it.  It's called the 55-5 rule and it's a simple way of organizing your life.,sputty,62,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/znx18/ive_thought_of_a_new_selfdisciplineproductivity/,"Currently it's 2:15 EST as I'm writing this.  I have 3 things on my list for this hour that I HAVE to do by 2:55.  If I finish them early I can just chill out and relax until then.

At 2:55 I stop whatever I'm working on and spend 5 minutes to plan out the next 55 minutes.  I write down anything on my mind that I have to work on.  If there's something that I need to do but can't immediately, I'll put it on a ""to do later"" or ""remember"" list.  

Starting at 3:00, the cycle will start again until 3:55.

The point of this exercise is to constantly reevaluate your progress.  By spending 5 minutes every hour to plan out your next 55 minutes, you can rescue yourself from periods of unproductivity and laziness.  

Even when you're playing games or socializing, it helps when you take 5 minutes out because then you can rethink your strategy or evaluate what you're doing wrong.  All of this in turn makes you more disciplined because you're constantly creating new goals and achieving them.

What I like about this is that it offers you flexibility by giving you time to relax after you've accomplished everything for that hour, but it also keeps you safe (from getting into super-laze/mindlessness mode, which we all know too well).  It keeps you in the moment and it doesn't let you get discouraged because you're always focused on the hour at hand.  

The only problem I've experienced so far using this method is when I set goals that are too lofty for myself for that hour.  While it is possible to transfer them over to the next hour, failing the goal for the first hour will make it easier to fail it during the next hour.

I will post more results about the 55-5 rule as my experiment continues.  I need to move on to the next task on my list now so check back in a bit.

EDIT: so far this rule is working. I was just at class so I couldn't do it for the previous hour, but as soon as I saw 7:55 I got back on my notebook and planned out my next hour. 

EDIT #2: Another common enemy of these kind of ""timed"" plans are distractions.  I've had quite a few since I started this experiment today, and once or twice they almost slowed me down.  However, the best thing I've found is, after you deal with your distraction, don't feel pressure or anything!  Just finish the items on your list and wait for the next :55 to begin planning.  Otherwise just relax and chill out.  

EDIT #3: If you think of something that you need to do, don't do it right this moment, but instead, put it on the list for the next 55 minutes.  This way you don't get overwhelmed every hour and you should always try to accomplish the tasks you originally designated for yourself before the next hour begins.",,False,,t5_2uzju,1347338880.0,,,True,t3_znx18,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/znx18/ive_thought_of_a_new_selfdisciplineproductivity/,

My old job started out great, but after a few years I got pigeonholed with few chances to advance or try anything new. I got fairly depressed and burned out (although it took me a long time to recognize that.) My stress and depression made it hard to look for new work. My manager was nice but inept.

I developed some pretty bad habits. My give a shit muscles were next to non-existent, so I was on the Internet constantly.

A few things I've already tried:

- Putting my alarm across the room. I just bring my phone back to bed and go back to sleep.
- Taking vitamins. I take D3 and Magnesium because my doctor recommended them. Doesn't make much noticeable difference.
- Exercise. I'm getting better about going and working out...but I still have trouble initially getting there. Afterwards, I always feel good, though.

Now that i'm out on summer break, i'm trying to discipline myself to a strict 8 hours of sleep per night. Bedtime at midnight, wake up at 8AM for my jog around town and push-ups.

Unfortunately even with an alarm clock set to 8:00, I still end up sleeping in through it to 9:00 or 10:00. The worst part is that sometimes I wake up at 8:00 to the alarm clock (which I purposely put out of reach so I have to stand up and walk over to it), and my half-asleep zombie self turns the alarm off, and gets back in bed. I feel like garbage when I wake up, but i'm starting to wonder if my body is just forcing itself to sleep more to cover the MASSIVE sleep debt I accumulated during college. 

Should I go easier on myself, and set my alarm for 9-10 and start my day then? I'm worried that if I get used to that much sleep, then my early classes in the fall semester will be even more brutal. I want to be more disciplined in all areas of my life, and I figured controlling my own sleep habits should be one of the most important steps.

I just feel like everything below is relevant and I'm really hoping for some good advice. To those who read it: thank you!!



I'm a 3rd year undergrad student in university and this summer I'm doing research under a professor. The work that I'm doing is not hands-on (it's math so I'm not in a lab, just reading research papers and textbooks, doing proofs, etc.), so I only meet with my professor once a week at most. The work is to be done on my own time, so I get to make my own hours and don't actually have to go into school to do my work. He doesn't care when or where I do the work, just as long as it gets done.

But, so far, it has not gotten done. 

I just can't focus or something. I start to read a paper, get two pages in, then my mind wanders or I get discouraged (this happens a lot - the material is difficult and I am still familiarizing myself with the research process) or bored and that's all the work I do for the day. I am a self-described ""giver-upper"". I end up spending three hours on my phone checking social networks, online shopping, watching tv, or laying in bed. When I'm working and I remember a video I wanna watch or a song I want to download, it's like I have to do it right at that moment. I try to ignore the thought and keep working but I just can't stop thinking about it and have to go do it right then (thus interrupting my work). And these are the days when I actually start to do any work at all - there are some days when I don't even bother looking at the material.

Also likely relevant: I've been depressed for a little over a year. I think that this is relevant in that it is very hard for me to motivate myself to do anything. I also don't handle stress well. When I have too much work piling up or the work seems too hard, my solution is just to either cry or nap. Not a good solution. 

So, in the end, the work doesn't get done. I finish some but not all of it, and I feel guilty about it. I respect and admire my professor so much and a portion of my paycheque comes directly from him… but for whatever reason this is not enough to motivate me to work.

Any thoughts, stories or advice? I feel like I need to change my lifestyle or something. (All of the above also applies during the school year when I'm just studying.

Look at the cost of life weed has brought upon you. From the age of 15 you have missed many girlfriends and other things because you couldn't be on 100 percent. You can't control yourself. You have to quit smoking with friends. Quit everything. Become who you are meant to be.

We are all addicts to superficial pleasures. Weed and alcohol are just more obvious, the tip of the iceberg. There's also tv, Facebook, reddit, pointless shopping, gambling, not talking to pretty girls. What addictions we accept as okay, decide how we live our lives.

An addiction to mediocrity is the most unseen and dangerous thing. It is most often the least harmful addiction that is the hardest to leave. 

Even good things like love can be counted as addictions. Some addictions may be good. The ones we choose define us.

All acceptable addictions are meditation, gym, work, girls. Even all these need to be used in moderation. But all breaks should ether be meditation, gym, work or girls related.

It is really simple actually. In my case I started watching The Office and on one weekend I finished 2 seasons. It was too much, so I made a system.

So this is my system, method of getting work done or doing what would I like to do more(reading a book or playing the guitar):

I said to myself that I get to watch only one episode of The Office per day. But for every hour of studying I get one more episode. For half an hour of exercising I also get one more episode as well as playing the guitar for half an hour. If there are several goals that you want to do, you should also reward yourself for every goal you achieve. But the harder one or the ones you want to to before the others should take less time or the reward should be greater in order to do them earlier. One other thing I did is that everyday I do 20 push ups and sit-ups. And I also get to watch one episode after I do them. It seems easy but the catch is that I can do this only once a day and next day I add one push up as well as a sit-up. So next day I have to do 21 of them. In the start it is easy, but as you go along it is really a nice exercise.

In conclusion it is somewhat of a rewarding system. I have been doing it for the past 2 weeks and it is going pretty well. In those 2 weeks I have always respected the rules and broke it only once.

Here is Ernest Hemingway's quote on the tip itself:

&gt; The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day … you will never be stuck. Always stop while you are going good and don’t think about it or worry about it until you start to write the next day. That way your subconscious will work on it all the time. But if you think about it consciously or worry about it you will kill it and your brain will be tired before you start.

Basically when you are forced to leave what you happen to be working on, instead of completely finishing it, try to stop right in the middle of it. That way when you come back, you will know exactly where to pick back up. Like Hemingway says, your subconscious will know where you left off and it will continue to do some computations. All of the computing your subconscious has done on the task will then percolate up whenever you choose to start that task back up.

Over time, you can be come more disciplined on jumping back into the middle of what you were working on.

I am 19 years old, I was a student at college before I dropped out before the end of the first semester. I dropped out because I choked, I stopped going to classes, I wasn't doing the work, and I was afraid. I was never good at school and college was overwhelming for me.

I believed the reason why I felt overwhelmed is because of other issues. I set goals/needs/wants over my education, primarily, me being overweight.

I dealt with being overweight practically my whole life, starting around 5th grade. and by 10th grade, I was around 230 lbs, I hated myself, I hated my body, and I blamed everything bad that happened to me around me being overweight. Around 11th grade, I started running with my school and it was very successful, I lost around 60 lbs and I felt great, I even ran a marathon! but after the marathon I hit a slope, I stopped running, I gained almost 20 pounds back and that was around the time I started smoking weed.

Fast forward to the beginning of this year. for roughly 7 months I did nothing but smoke weed with friends and I had to quit, I quit for around 2 months before going on and off of smoking weed, each time I would get the munchies, eat and hate myself. I got back on track around the beginning of the summer with running and eating well and I managed to push my weight down to 155 (roughly 8-10 lbs in waterweight) This was because I had my brother pushing me and doing exercises with me, after he stopped doing it with me, I stopped doing it.

Fast forward to today. I weigh 168 lbs, I either work, or I sit at home all day which gives me a lot of time to make bad decisions. I have terrible discipline when I am not occupied. I recently applied to go back to school but I'm terrified that I might fuck up again. I don't care about my weight, I don't care be really muscular, I want to lose my body fat and I can't seem to keep the motivation because growing up I was never taught discipline, and I feel at a total loss. With all of this pent up in my mind, it is really affecting me and my future, I feel unmotivated towards everything.

 I used to be an avid gamer, now I can't sit down for more than 10 minutes and play games, I can't sit down to watch TV or watch movies, and with the desperation in my effort to pass time, I fall back on weed.

The over arching problem I believe I have is I am unable to self discipline myself, on one side, I have a passion to do stuff, but there is no authoritative ruling that would discipline me when I stray off from my goals, I never had that driving force growing up and now that I'm 19, when I mess up, I just tell myself whatever and that i'll do better next time without any repercussions to my actions

All I have been told through life in order to get through this was to ""Just do it"" and I cannot do it that way.

What I'm looking for by making this post:

Advice/steps on how to discipline myself, and maintain the motivation to strive on
Someone to talk to about my progress, road blocks, questions, and when I'm feeling unmotivated, have them motivate me, (Since graduating high-school, all my close friends have moved far away to other schools and I've since lost a daily contact with them :/)
Advice in general.

The second semester was by far much better than the first, in terms of stress, productivity, overall happiness. However, things are only going to get more difficult from here, and I suppose that right now, I'm feeling a bit lost and hopeless.

I will be taking 5 classes. Based on previous semesters, and opinions of other students, this will likely be about 70 hours per week, including attending lecture, studying, and completing homework.

I have a number of personal, self-improvement goals that I'd like to make progress toward throughout the year as well. Mostly, these include exercising, practicing guitar, learning to meditate, and reading books. I also intend to cultivate better sleeping habits, and get a solid 8 hours per night. I really thrive on that amount of sleep.

Here's what my average weekday looks like, as far as I can tell:

**8:00-9:00** wake up, shower, groom

**9:00-9:30** breakfast

**9:30-10:00** walk to class

**10:00-2:30** class (4.5 of 10 work hours)

**2:30-3:00** walk back to room

**3:00-6:00** homework/study (7.5 of 10 work hours)

**6:00-7:00** dinner

**7:00-9:30** moar homework (10 hours complete)

**9:30-11:00** I guess this is my free time?

**11:00-12:00** get ready for bed, sleep

So, assuming that I perform the above tasks with total efficiency and that my 10-hour workday estimate is accurate (which I am fairly certain it will be), this is still a wretched day! I have 1.5 hours to exercise, play my guitar, meditate, or just sit still for 2 seconds to recharge. I never step foot off my campus. Also note that I have not had any meaningful interaction with another human.

I also don't know if I have the willpower to actually work for 10 hours on both Saturday and Sunday.

I am feeling a great deal of discontent with my life looking like this. I want to get disciplined so I can actually live a life outside of class, rather than somehow escape mental annihilation in favor of mere burnout and exhaustion.

Am I being too ambitious? Is it foolish to hope for personal happiness while I'm in college? I hope not, but it seems that this is the case.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1jo3sy,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1jo3sy/need_help_developing_a_disciplined_lifestyle_as_a/,

(not titled)



It’s time to make a commitment to improving yourself.

You’ve been stuck in these pointless cycles for more than long enough.

It’s an off balance way to live.

And stopping and looking, your life feels like a tightrope walk in the dark.

You need the discipline to do things that are good for you.

Avoiding; cowardly immature evasion.

This is the core symptom of your problem. 

The core of the source of that symptom could be that you’re running 
away from something.

What you’re running from is shapeless and still unnamed. 

A day could come where you look far enough inside and face it.

But right now it’s time to stop the bleeding, get up and start walking.

You know what you need to do.

Or at least you know the direction to go.

The high points when your resolve is limitless.

The low points when life seems a useless exercise; a semi-conscious 
haze with no meaning.

Every second you waste in this malicious, controlling cycle is already gone.

It will wear your will away and with it the years will go too.

The path out is in part learning to concentrate. 

You’re scattered.

A broken mirror image of what you know you could be.

You know how to pick up the pieces.

You know how to become a whole person.

You've tasted what lies at the end, however briefly. 

And it is sweet.

And it is worth it.

I had recently finished Arnold Schwarzenegger's auto-biography and in it he credits his military discipline and growing up to part of the success for his accomplishments.

So, like in the army, I began with something small to build up my discipline. ""Make your bed"" every morning no matter what. Even in a hotel. Since then I've been adding things to do every day to build upon my discipline. These things are what I would call self discipline actives put in the affirmative. ""Do X everyday"". Easy enough to follow.

However, self discipline goals not written in the affirmative I find much much much harder to follow. For example ""Don't eat any sugar today"" or ""Don't overeat"". Anything with a limitation to it is much harder.

There's hundreds if not thousands of subreddits where people have said that, I'm sure...but this is my demon.

When I was younger, I was awesome at school.  Things came so easy to me, I turned into a cocky asshole about it.  I would get student of the month awards and perfect exams and whatnot despite not studying.  Study habits?  No need, it was all in my brain already.  I had a 5-page paper on something due in high school and literally typed it with my head craned to the side while watching the Knicks on TV.  I got a 95.  

And then I took my first AP course...okay, it was harder, a lot more to digest, but stayed afloat until the AP exam.  3 out of 5.  I kind of got rattled by that experience, but then sort of realized I should probably study better.  

Then AP Physics came around the next year.  The night before the first test I spent an hour the night before doing what I thought was good studying.  I got a 50.  Out of 100 (in fairness, grading was on a curve so I got a C, but I still bombed).  I remember somewhere around this point just getting frustrated and basically saying a general ""fuck it"" to productivity.  I went from high 90's and 100 average grades to low 90's pretty quickly (this isn't exactly getting addicted to meth and dropping out, I know, but maybe one of you have something that parallels this experience).  

This spilled over into my habits/interests as well.  Songwriting, drawing, it all kind of ended up as a list of unfinished projects.  I actually have a notebook filled with just titles of songs that I had ideas for but never finished.  I finished a few songs during the above ""AP"" experience and I've been in a couple bands where we finished songs together, but as an adult it's been more regret than satisfaction.

When I was younger I rationalized it by labeling myself as ""slacker,"" as if I could get by like that.  By the time college came around I went in with no study habits and worse, no desire to learn study habits. I actually did get by (as opposed to truly succeeding and achieving) with a lot of what I retrospectively term ""pity B's.""  In 4 semesters of college I received one ""A,"" and that was from an adjunct professor who clearly was disinterested in teaching and I later learned gave everyone in the class an A.  The momentary happiness I felt when I got that grade evaporated when I talked to classmates about it.  

Okay, this is getting longer than I planned, so I'll sum up where I'm at now:  

* I'm 31/m and I need to get my shit in gear.   

*  I have a mile long (only slight exaggeration?) list of unfinished projects  

*   I've been actively trying to do this for a while now, but now I have added incentive...a baby on the way in a few months.  I want to do everything I can for this child, but how do I ensure I do everything I can for them when I can't even accomplish tasks I deem important for myself?  I don't want to rely on parental instinct to kick in; I'm trying to be proactive about it.  

So yeah, that's me in a large nutshell.  I've been reading through a few posts already and have gotten several ideas to get the ball rolling.  On the other hand, I feel like I should get the quote under the GetDisciplined logo tattooed across my chest backwards so I can read it every morning.  Business ideas, websites, webcomics, work tasks, songs...so much unfinished in my life, so much regret.

***GET DISCIPLINED FAQ***



Welcome to r/getdisciplined! Please look through the FAQ in case any of your questions have already been answered. Don’t have any questions? Read through it anyway, you may learn something new :D


**What exactly is r/getdisciplined?**

Get Disciplined is a subreddit of similarly-minded people who recognise that there are areas in their lives that need work on, to change. Discipline, contrary to popular opinion, isn't for the grumpy army colonel that yells at soldiers to do more pushups, but instead discipline is simply “Training expected to produce a specific character or pattern of behavior”. And that is simply who we are in this subreddit, a bunch of people that through habit and training are trying to bring about positive change to our lives!

**Okay, so how does one get more disciplined then?**

Well, that really depends on the individual. The more appropriate question is what areas/things in your life do you need or want to improve on?

However if you do simply just want to build some discipline through some small little “drills”, you can do one/some of these.

1. Set and stare at a wall for 10 mns. Don't close your eyes, don't day dream.... just try to focus on a single spot for 10 mns.

2. 10 mn rule. If you find yourself with a spare ten minutes, do something with it. Waiting for food to cook? Put some laundry in. Waiting for a download? Check some emails . . . etc etc.

Will add more of these as I come across them

**Why do you guys have a rule about having to post more than just a link in a post?**

Because we care about the quality of the posts in this subreddit. We also want, in every post, for discussion to happen as well. If you do just want to post a motivational image or video, then please do it at r/GetMotivated!



**Please note as well** : there is no place in this subreddit for cynicism. If you don't agree with someone or something in this subreddit, feel free to give them a reply expressing your opinion. But please don't just be a cynic and start attacking stuff. We are here to discuss and not just criticise.

I just got back from my fellowship at my University, and since the beginning of June I've had a ten page paper due for a summer class. I get home 8 days ago and think to myself ""yeah, I'm gonna get this out of the way, then enjoy some of the last four weeks of my final summer ever!"" Fast forward to today, and all I've done, instead of this paper, is get up at 8:30, ready to take on the day with this paper and get on with summer. Know what I've really been doing? Staring at a computer screen or probably anywhere from 9-11 hours a day. Since I got back. And all I have to show for it is 4.5 pgs of this paper. Now I know that sounds like at least progress, right? Well I could have knocked this thing out of the park in probably a day and a half, two days MAX. Instead I've avoided it, and just looked at fucking reddit for the whole week. SO, not only have I not gone out and seen my close friends in town, but I've also done absolutely nothing with the vast majority of my time! And the defining moment for when all of this hits me? It happened while I was talking to my girlfriend. She was having a hard time, and ask me to tell her some kind of news about my life. 

I had nothing. I could literally offer her not one interesting aspect of my life from the entire week, nor give any interesting plans with friends. I sat there, dumbfounded at the realization that this last week I've accomplished nothing of higher value to myself. All I've done is let my week long distraction from this paper keep me inside and on the internet when I could be out there enjoying it! 

Honestly reddit, I don't know what I'm trying to accomplish with this post. Honestly, I think I just needed to vent about this. But if there had to be a point to this message, I would say it would be to warn everyone visiting here:  don't put it off. However much you think its too late to get yourself disciplined, don't put it off. In my short period of self-discipline, I got amazing results. It truly works wonders. Do. Not. Wait. Because at some point, you'll be talking to your girlfriend, or your close buddy, or hell, even your teacher, and suddenly get caught with your pants down where you can't tell them one awesome thing you've done this week. And you'll realize the true damage that the internet, games, tv, what have you, is much more severe than you ever thought.

GetD? GDisc?), have you ever stopped to think why we uphold discipline as such a golden virtue? If something does not come naturally to us, why do we force it upon ourselves? 

Why is it so good to control yourself, to force yourself to do something that comes as unnatural to you, instead of just letting yourself feel and do what feels right? 

Perhaps discipline is just a way to survive in this world. I think that this is the only way to look at it. Looking at the top posts, I feel that there is nothing wrong in itself of waking up apathetic or not being able to wake up in time. It really is the consequences of those actions- being made fun of, being fired, not making enough money to eat, etc. 

For why else would we need discipline? There is no downside to a messy room, except to others. We do not mind it, or else we would have cleaned it. However, we think about the potential problems- a friend unexpectedly comes over, we lose our homework in the mess- and that is why we do it. 

As for getting to a goal of yours, is any goal really worth it if you are suffering every step of the way? Now, I am not talking about the people who actually enjoy their journey but just need a little structure to their time. But there are others who use discipline to try to force themselves into something they're not. They use the rigid lines of discipline to try to mold themselves into a different shape. They are unhappy and suffocating, but they have convinced themselves that they cannot be happy until they fit that mold. 

Perhaps we should really look at the structures of our world. The incessant checkpoints we have to meet everyday to continue. Clock in at 7, make sure this project is done by Wednesday, leave the house by 1 to make a doctor's appointment at 2... Our man made time is what gives rise to discipline, and yet, it is its greatest enemy. For without time, there would be no need to force ourselves to do something everyday. But there is never enough time to do all that we want to do.

Perhaps some of us do not choose discipline, but rather, discipline is forced on us. Having to be on time somewhere forces us to behave in a manner contrary to how we want. Having a due date forces us to chunk our time or else pull an all nighter. Setting a goal to achieve in a month forces us to do uncomfortable things with our body and minds in order to achieve it. 

Maybe we should look at discipline differently- lack of discipline is not because you are a weak man, but rather, it is because you are rebelling against the confines of this man made time. 

Sorry about the rant guys. Anyways, what are all your views on discipline?

like you and I said this is not the way I want to die  
I want to live my life  
And he realized  
That there's a better way to go

So he worked for days and days and made a fire  
And eventually he was the father of empires.  

This is the legacy that you inherit  
There's no such thing as a prodigy, we all share it

To shut off the computer and stop texting on your phone

Is watching tv and fuckin around really all you know how to do?  

When we were kids, there was something higher  
Turn us into a fighter and light our eyes with fire  
Make us play hard, work hard, we would never get tired  

Are you telling me that the joy was all fake  
That we are all on this earth to just make  
Due with the meager payments that we're given  
Is living paycheck to paycheck really even living?  

You are better than that, my dear.  
I'm telling you it's there. You just need to hear.  
Stop all the voices that tell you to fear  
Stop all the voices that tell you to care

Being your own boss seems fun until you realize you still have to get stuff done, and there's no one but you to make sure it happens. If you work for yourself, attend school, or just find yourself doing less than you wish you had, this problem applies to you.

A simple solution is to work in a team that can keep track of each other. This is why startups with multiple founders are more likely to succeed. But many of us don't have easy way to form such a team.

That's where my idea comes in: Form teams of people working on unrelated things. Other people don't need to participate in your work to make sure that you do it. Checking that you did what you said you would is simple. And you can provide the same service back to them.

Having someone to track your productivity, and keep tabs on you may be all it takes for you to become disciplined and productive.

I've been following a lot of self help advice lately, and I've been doing a lot better. Got rid of all the procrastination style subreddits, been hitting the gym lately, and my bad habits have been fading away (thanks to some very helpful communities I've subbed to here).

But my issue now is that I have this spare time that I can't fill with anything.

Had sex issues with the SO, looked into /r/nofap. Fixed my DE and ED. (although I'm skeptical on their fanaticism)

Felt like I smoked too much weed, joined /r/leaves and now I don't get high daily anymore.

Read *The Demise Of Guys* by Philip Zimbardo and I'm in the process of selling most of my video games (and re-confirmed my unhealthy relationship with porn)

But now I have nothing to do. I can't even waste time on reddit because I'm subbed to nothing but subreddits about self help and potential hobbies (i.e. not /r/funny). I'm unemployed, and going off to school in a month makes getting a job difficult. I've played and wrote music for 10 years now (I'm 19) but it's a very solitary hobby. I have two friends, my SO and one friend from elementary, but I don't really get along with him anymore. I literally just exist.

My question, then, is, what are some good habits to pick up to fill my time with? Stuff you guys/gals picked up or do currently. I keep my space clean, quit smoking (weed+tobacco), eat relatively well and my lifts have been going up. I want to start running soon, but that's really the only thing on the horizon for me.

I'd like to start a discussion on the lack of accomplishment felt after achieving ones goals. I would also like to include some background info leading up to my current situation. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, especially from someone in a similar situation, but if the post just ends up dying then that's alright, I at least had a chance to vent.

I left school when I was 16 years old. Why I left is a mystery to me now, I can only remember being unhappy at the time. Shortly after leaving I began smoking weed. I would spend every day watching movies, reading books and playing video games. The only thing I accomplished during this time was teaching myself how to play guitar.

When I turned 18 I started receiving social welfare and moved into my own place. Most of my friends were taking a year off before going to college so it became a second home for them. I don't think a day went by without some form of partying going on. This is when I started using cocaine, ketamine, and ecstasy on a regular basis. I spent all my money on drugs and got kicked out for not paying rent. I went back to live with my parents again.

One day when I was 20 years old I had a horrible experience after walking home from a party. I had taken quite a few pills that night along with some cocaine and whiskey and when I got back home I lay down on my bed and began to feel my heartbeat become increasingly erratic and I couldn't breathe well enough to call out for help, my chest felt like a missile testing ground. I was convinced I was going to die and it would be my own fault.

I must have passed out because my next memory is waking up the next day and bursting into tears, overwhelmed with relief. I came clean about everything to my mom who obviously had suspected a lot of things but didn't think I was selling and taking coke/ecstasy. She was very understanding and supportive.

It has been two years since then and I haven't taken any drugs (including cigarettes) since the day I spoke with my mom. I started eating well, exercising, and developed a healthy sleeping habit. Despite all this I can't get over the fact that I'm still receiving social welfare and living with my parents. No one will give me a job because I have never worked and have no educational documents due to leaving school early. Because of this I'm studying hard so I can take the exams I would've taken when I was 17/18 had I not left school. It's kind of embarrassing considering most of my friends are in their second year of college but this is the only hope I have to attend college too.

I pushed myself really hard to get this far, it's extremely hard to make and stick to such big life changes and yet I don't have the sense of accomplishment one would expect from those changes. Some days it seems like I feel no emotion, that I have no direction. There are good days too, where I feel happy, but on those days I can sometimes become distant and dull in the blink of an eye.

That wraps things up. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.

I was wondering how you gain and keep control over your own thoughts?

I find that in today's society it's really easy to have your attention scattered over many different areas. Not only do we use a variety of media and devices for ingoing and outgoing information, but there are also so many facets of our lives to consider. We have to make decisions about every single area of our lives, from career choices, what type of car to drive, what kind of person to be in a relationship with, how to look after our body etc etc, down to what brand of shampoo we need for our hair type. 
Also, we are intelligent and have access to so much more information. I think reddit people are particularly subject to overconsumption of information. In a way I think this is great. We have so much access to information, opinions, education....

I'm struggling though. I know I'm not alone with this. 
I have goals, but they're vague and I get bogged down in the details about how to work on them. I have so many things going on in my life that I can barely keep track of them, let alone work on them. For instance, I do not exercise at all, but am currently weighing up whether to join a gym or try it alone, or join some group exercise....talking of which I do want to be more social so was thinking of a dance class, but to do that I'd need to buy some suitable clothes....talking of which I don't have enough decent clothes at the moment and am quite embarrassed by my wardrobe, which is having a knock on effect at work...


You see how these thoughts spiral? 
I have been working hard at keeping my apartment tidy and limiting my food choices so that I can give myself as much mental clarity as possible, trying to not have decision fatigue, but I struggle. I feel like my thoughts are floating around in the ether, unable to be pinned down. I feel that I never have a good grasp of all my issues and everything going on with my life. Oh how I'd love a spreadsheet for managing it all!

I know some of the answers already. I know I should only have one tab open at a time in my browser. I should switch off the computer. I should just start exercising and course correct as I go. 

But I wanted to start a discussion about mental discipline. I think modern society makes it difficult for us to concentrate, and therefore get clarity and continuity of thought. I feel like my thoughts now come in 'moments'. And I have so many threads in my life, that sometimes things can get lost for days. And tying all these threads together into something coherent is another challenge altogether!

[Tapplol asked me on another thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/13es61/official_announcement_congrats_rgetdisciplined_we/c749h49) about my advice about procrastinating, and I ended up giving him a rather extensive answer, so I thought I could share it here as well!


Okay... in my opinion, to stop procrastinating only 2 things are needed.

**1. Find out why you procrastinate**

This is a really important step that I think is often under emphasised in alot of ""How to Stop Procrastinating"" posts. If don't know why you procrastinate, you will never be able to address it properly, and therefore never beat it in the long run. 

In the case of myself, it started many years ago when I was forced to go to a school that I didn't want to go to. I was very uncomfortable there at first, and therefore reacted by trying to ""escape"" through browsing the web, playing video games, reading books etc, basically anything that let met escape my current situation/reality. Even though I did, later on, end up enjoying that school, I had already started forming the habit that whenever I was faced with a situation that I found uncomfortable or stressful, I would react by escaping from it. This caused me to start to procrastinate in alot of areas in my life such as studying, exercise etc...

In my opinion, most (if not all) people procrastinate because they want to put off = avoid = escape something that they don't want to do. But yeah, some people might be exceptions, but nevertheless, find out why you procrastinate!

**2. You have to want it bad enough**

I'm not a big fan, at all, of the *""JUST GET OFF YOUR F****** *ASS AND  F****** *DO IT""* advice that circulates Reddit, as it isn't real advice at all, so I'm not going to do it.

Personally, I think *""If you want something bad enough, you'll find a way""* is much better advice. I've found that so many bad procrastinators, like me, procrastinate even by trying to find that perfect pomodoro technique, image, motivational quote, productivity app (the list goes on) that will get them to stop procrastinating &amp; work. However you just end up motivated, at the most, which is great, but not enough.

The ONLY thing that I've found works is that I have to want it bad enough. Full stop, end of story. Because you can have the best studying/working schedule, all the tips &amp; tricks in the world on how not to procrastinate, but if you dont want it bad enough, you won't find a way and therefore it wont make a single difference! You will just keep on procrastinating!

How do you get to that stage of wanting something bad enough, you may ask? Well, everybody actually wants something bad enough. When I get up, it's often because I want to eat breakfatst bad enough, before I have to start work. And I want to work, because I badly want to achieve more and more in life.

**Sum it all up**

There are a whole lot of other smaller steps that really do help, such as eliminating/limiting those things that cause you to start procrastinating, but it basically it comes down to this. If you have the willpower, you will achieve it. If you don't have the willpower, you won't achieve it.

Tried to kick my ass into gear, and I did. I got a good internship. I made good connections. I started being more cleanly, and I focused on things that I wanted to do for my future.

And yet, looking back, I feel no pride. I have no sense of accomplishment. I can only keep thinking ""meh, i could've done better."" or ""it wasn't enough. people have done much more than that"".  I have no sense of accomplishment in the effort I've put in.

I don't believe it was that difficult.  I had to change a lot of my mindset, and my old mindset (which is not entirely gone) was a lazy piece of garbage.  I'm really not anything special, and I don't feel as if I have the right to feel proud or accomplished for what I've done, because so many others have done so much more, and I'm still a lazy, spoiled piece of work.  I don't want to be, and I'm trying to change that.

But I want to feel proud of my work.  I want to be able to look at my work and not think ""it's really nothing special"", even when people who know what they are talking about tell me it is something special, or it was done very well.  

The only thing in the past year or so I have felt proud of was simple. This past weekend my father and I laid down some heavy slab into a drench so that leaves were easier to clean up.

The past two years have seen change that was great but took a lot of work, so it's been a long time since I have been able to ""coast"". I recently had some recently disheartening losses on the business side and, surprisingly, just lost the will to do anything and everything. Apparently I was running on fumes but didn't realize it.  

Right now I've been picking myself back up and have been focusing on organizing and prioritizing my actions to make things more efficient and wholesome. Hopefully this minimizes burning out. I also don't really have clear long term goals - instead I have a myriad of short term ones, so I'm working on creating a larger structure to keep things in focus.

So while I'm working on this, what strategies have you guys used to get yourselves back up and going again after losing steam? What did you learn from your mistakes that led you to creating a more robust system for yourselves?

It's crazy to think that less than 7 months ago, this subreddit didn't even exist. But here we are, 6 months later, an active community of 30,000  (and soon to be more) strong!

So to celebrate this, we thought we could do a wiki drive for /r/getdisciplined!

**What's a wiki drive, you may ask?**

A wiki drive is a time where everyone here in /r/getdisciplined is asked to / really encouraged to contribute to the wiki of /r/getdisciplined!

**Okay, so what's the wiki for /r/getdisciplined then?**

[Well this is it, if you just want the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/wiki/index). Otherwise, the wiki is the place where we answer all the commonly asked questions (a.k.a FAQ), list helpful applications &amp; websites etc, that are relevant to /r/getdisciplined.

The thing is, though, we need the input of everyone to help make it as good as possible, and as well to best cover all the constant questions &amp; needs that are relevant to this subreddit.

**So how do I add material to the wiki then?**

Assuming that you are already on the wiki page, just scroll to the top, and you will see a button saying *edit*, which you want to click. Then you just add the material that you want to. **Please note** that the formatting rules are just the same as in a post.

**Cool, so I can just add anything I want to?**

No, you can't. Please only add material/content that is relevant to /r/getdisciplined! Please also make sure that it is well formatted and not just a block of text without titles or paragraphs. Also, if you have a link to add, please add it at the bottom of the page.

**And lastly, please be warned that anyone just adding stupid crap to the wiki will be banned from editing it.**

Well that's all. If you have a question about editing the wiki, PLEASE ask it here before rushing ahead.

Cheers and wishing everyone a merry wiki drive!

I've never posted here before and I just discovered this place, so I apologize in advance if I'm breaking any posting norms. I read the sidebar, so I hope I'm doing everything right. 

----
**A little about me**

I used to be a subscriber in /r/getmotivated. I really liked the sentiment, but I got fed up with the meme posts and f*** this and f*** that in every other post, so I left. From the looks of it, this appears to be a more mature, fleshed out version of that place, so I hope there are people here who will appreciate what I have to share here. 

I'll start with a confession: I suffer from what I think is a lack of discipline. I have for at least 7 years, if not my entire life. I'm naturally very smart, by objective standards (early education gifted programs, great SAT scores, astoundingly good psych evaluation that landed me in Mensa, and top-of-the-line GREs), so I went many years without the need to learn discipline. Didn't do my homework yet? Do that three hour calculus assignment in the 10 minutes before class and get all of them right. Didn't study for the test? Didn't need to. Always the first one done on examinations of any kind, always able to pull Herculean demonstrations of will out of my ass in order to meet any last minute deadline. 

The problem is that things can't stay like that forever. Life catches up with you. I once read that [intelligence is like a knife](http://maxkle.in/your-high-iq-will-kill-your-startup) in that you can rely on it early on because it's such a huge advantage, but eventually there are people and circumstances that will overwhelm you. *Discipline* beats intelligence in the long run every time. That is why I am here now. 

I briefly sought counseling in 2005, because I knew things were going awry, but it was the end of undergrad for me and I was still getting by. I got into grad school despite my slipping GPA and I forgot about counseling for a while. As I went through my master's program, however, I started to notice that it was harder and harder to keep up. I started omitting reading assignments. When I waited until the last minute to do a paper, I was finding that I could barely finish on time. 

I hit my PhD program two years ago and it felt like I had literally run into a wall. *Everyone* around me seemed more industrious. It was and still is hard to keep up with everything. I started going back for counseling and I'm now on several medications that greatly help my affect and give me a head start on getting my act together, so I heartily endorse treatment for anyone who's found that they have a persistent or recurring issue with anything that would cause them to seek out a subreddit like this one. 

The problem is that *no medication can give you discipline*. No matter what you take, nothing can make you get up in the morning, take your pills, and have breakfast. Nothing can make you do the things you have to do to pay the bills. No substance can force you to form good habits. You have to do all of that on your own. 

How? What is the real root of the problem? How do you fix it?

---

**The Science**

A short while back, my friend in a psychology graduate program in Florida introduced me to [the concept of ego depletion](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/magazine/do-you-suffer-from-decision-fatigue.html?pagewanted=all). I was intrigued. Was willpower something more than this intangible notion of the freedom of choice? Could anyone ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps"" by simply forcing themselves to? 

It turns out that willpower might be the singularly most important aspect to human behavior. It's definitely measurable and it's drained by so many things that we never even think about. You think you only exert willpower to make hard decisions? Wrong. Deciding what to watch on Netflix or what to eat for dinner can be just as bad as, if not worse than, making important decisions like whether or not to quit your job. 

Willpower is strongly linked to glucose. Are you hungry? Don't expect to force yourself to the gym, because you lack the very resource you need to get you there. That's the catch-22 of dieting, too: A new diet can often mean you're eating less food, which leads to lower glucose, which lowers your willpower, which lowers the chances that you'll adhere to your diet. 

The environment, physically and mentally, is another willpower vampire. Clutter is much more than just debris: You're passively expending willpower for everything that doesn't have a place or has a place and isn't in that place. From coats that aren't hung up in the coat closet to tasks you need to complete that either aren't written down or aren't scheduled, your brain is trying to resolve those concepts and it's using up your willpower to do so. 

We think we're *so* in control of ourselves, that we're the ones in charge, but there are so many hazards we just aren't aware of. The key to finding discipline is in illuminating those hazards and avoiding them wherever possible. Eat foods that digest more slowly (proteins and vegetables, rather than sugars and starches) so you can have an even supply of glucose and a steady source of willpower. Write down *everything* you can think of that you need to do, even if you just store that list somewhere you never see it (I like to tuck these things away in an Evernote document so that I know they're recorded, but I don't have to see them every day and get overwhelmed). Clean your place of living, because research shows that sitting in a messy place makes it *much* harder to make decisions and makes people much more likely to give up on tasks that require the exertion of willpower. 

---

**Further reading**

These aren't pop-psych concepts or trite, motivational notions; these are scientifically sound, empirically supported principles of human behavior. As such, you can read about them and I *implore* you to do so. Here are my recommendations:

* ""Stumbling on Happiness"" by Daniel Gilbert: I don't like pop books that aren't supported by research, but this one is chock full of scientific support. Covers everything from the weakness of human imagination to the sunk cost fallacy. If you read *one book* on the fallacies of the human mind and how they affect you, read this one. 

* ""Willpower: Rediscovering Mankind's Greatest Strength"" by Tierney and Baumeister: Baumeister is pretty much the original nexus for willpower research and this is a book co-written by him very recently. It's accessible, but it's also a series of one research study after another (presented in a way that anyone can understand). The authors also do a *great* job of conveying just how to use these ideas in daily life, which may be beneficial to members of /r/getdisciplined.

* ""The Science of Fear"" by Daniel Gardner: This one isn't about discipline, but it's about why and how humans fear the wrong things. It draws from the same fallacies of human thought as the previous two books, so it may help illuminate the inner workings of the brain in a way that is helpful. 

* Kahneman and Tversky (absolutely anything): These are the two guys who first pioneered the idea that the brain was a fallacious place, not a perfectly rational machine. They introduced the ideas of learning heuristics and the idea of simultaneous conscious and non-conscious neural activity, ideas that much of this field is now based on. Kahneman now has a book out called ""Thinking Fast and Slow"" that's scientifically dense, but somewhat readable by the general public. You could also check out original research by these two, though it's much more difficult to digest.

The responses were all amazing and everyone gave great advice. It was overwhelming, in a good way, I'm not used to that much positive feedback. So, thanks to everyone who replied, and thanks to the person who gave /u/madplayshd well deserved gold- that was generous and awesome.

So, just an update for anyone who is interested: 

After the first few comments I decided to go out and get a hair cut, recommended by /u/IronGears and the first book in the Wheel of Time series, recommended by /u/always_SFW. The hair cut looks ok, but it feels pretty great. Even just to get something done. 

Along those lines /u/zfolwick recommended that I start cleaning for 20 min exactly every day. I did that yesterday as well and it made a huge difference in my mood. After this post, I have dishes to wash.  

I also joined meetup.com, recommended by /u/MaidenVoyage and I am going to do my best to force myself to go to one of those this week. And /u/mission_transission recommended I do some volunteer work. I contacted a local political campaign this morning to see if I can help out. Also, as many of you suggested, I called my local University to see about getting some low cost therapy sessions in. 

A lot of people recommended the gym, so I am going to sign up at the local gym today. I think I should start out slow, maybe just do the elliptical at first. I dont know if I can lift weights too well. 

I've been on /r/nofap, /r/stopdrinking, and /r/pornfree for about a week now. I give them a lot of the credit for getting me to the point where I feel like I can do something about my situation. If you haven't joined them yet, I highly recommend it. 

I still need to work on developing a schedule and a routine for this. I will be searching this sub for more info on that. I think Ill make a google calendar or an excel spreadsheet. /u/madplayshd (congrats on getting bestofed and the gold!) and /u/ptProgrammer gave some awesome words of encouragement and laid out some steps to accomplish goals. I am working on defining what my goals are and will come up with a SMART plan soon.

I'm writing for advice possibly on what is the last very bad habit of mine I really want to break.
Over the last year I've managed to go from living off of parental support and junk food to getting and passing the probation period on a pretty nice job; I’ve been cooking in the evenings, getting more work done on my personal projects even with less free time and I’m starting at a gym for the first time next week.
However, one bad habit I still have is getting up in the mornings and getting to bed. Even though getting up late costs me increasing amounts of money depending on how late I leave in order to arrive to work on time. Many years of ‘student living’ in to the small hours, not to mention many international friends I enjoy talking with means I often don’t want to go to bed. And when I do go to bed, I worry about being distracted by my own sometimes less optimistic thoughts so end up using old TV programs or podcasts as noise to distract me till I pass out, but often not till sometimes 3am or later which means a 7:30 alarm time turns in to a 8:10 actually-get-out-of-bed-time.
I’ve tried using the likes of http://sleepyti.me/ to fix the sleep cycle, but that does me no good if I ignore it for ‘five more minutes’. Has anyone else had to deal with this sort of bad habit in the past and how did you overcome it?",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_18nxfv,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/18nxfv/getting_rid_of_my_last_bad_habit/,

I live with my boyfriend. I'm messy, I rarely do housework because I can't bring myself to get off the couch. My boyfriend is amazing and does a shitload of DIY projects, the biggest and current one being the complete renovation of the bathroom. He gets home from work and works in the bathroom. On the weekend he gets up early to work on it as well. Every time he asks for help I oblige, but would prefer not to, because it gets in the way of me doing fuck all besides fooling around on reddit and smoking weed. I have no idea how he puts up with me.

On top of that, I have severe emotional issues, and am sometimes extremely mean for no reason. I immediately regret it, but the damage is done as soon as it spews out.

At work, I can't bring myself to focus, and I end up spending most of my time on the internet.

I'm also in debt and collection agencies call me several times a day.

I am a fuckup.

But I want to get better. I want to become the person I know I can be. I want to save my relationship. I want to save my *life*.

I've lived on my own, away from my parents for 3 years now, and have always done all right, but I guess I need a little parenting tonight. Here goes. 

I have amazing friends, they are incredible people doing amazing things. Just recently a couple of my friends got into the Ivies, and yesterday two of my friends got calls for Oxford/Cambridge interviews.

I don't know how to handle this. I love my friends, but honestly, I don't know how to go about my situation. After working my ass off to get 6As at A Levels, through a private school I got a 100% scholarship to; I got into all the universities I wanted to get into. But couldn't afford to pay tuition, and didn't get enough financial aid. I'm doing a lot of online courses and stuff from edx and coursera, but I don't know if this is what I want to do. Now, I work part-time at restaurant, and this is not where I want to be. 

I'll just say it, I'm jealous. 

I am extremely competitive. Which is something that has been hurting me recently. I've been working my ass off trying to get enough money made to start up my own little business, but the truth is, I can never be the best at everything. I can't go to a university, I can't be the richest in the world, can't be the best football player. 

I know this is a really stupid post, but I can sense my discipline wavering because I know that no matter where I am, the quest never ends, because there will always be people who are better than me. What's the point in trying, if all you're going to be is another face in the crowd? Why not just spend my days getting drunk and hitting the clubs every night, at least people seem to be enjoying themselves there.

If I can never win, why should I try? 

I have nothing to work towards. I can't beat the system. There's nowhere for me to go, and I'm extremely disappointed in myself for thinking these things. This is entirely uncharacteristic of me.

2. 4-7 days before the exam: Depression. I know the exam is just around the corner, but I feel completely deprived of energy, and while feeling extremely guilty, still can't be arsed to pick up my notes for more than 1-2 hours.

3. 3-2 days before the exam: Distraction. Suddenly I get interested in something totally unrelated to the exam, and even while studying, I can't stop thinking about it. I think this is a way for me to cope with the pressure of the upcoming exam.

4. The day before the exam: I suddenly realize that I've wasted all this time when I could've studied instead, and start revising furiously, until 10-11PM. Meanwhile I feel incredibly guilty and disappointed.

When I was a young child, I used to struggle, every day, with getting the essentials done. The schoolwork that was due the next day, necessary forms, that sort of thing. I was never one of those people who could just sit down and get things done; I've always been distractible, needing to be doing three or four things at once to be doing anything at all. Through a lot of parental discipline and many tears, I finally got it through my thick skull that deadlines are non-negotiable, and I haven't missed one since. 

However, my self-discipline never really progressed past that point. I still leave things until the last minute, so my final products are never as good as they could be. They're always *fine*, but whereas my *fine* used to get me in the top of the class, I recently started an intensive grad school program at a great school, and suddenly what used to be A work is smack-dab in the middle of the curve. I know full well that I'm not brilliant like most of the other people in my program, so really my only hope is to outwork them: but I'm working to my limits already. It takes me fourteen hours to do what most people do in eight. I'm not one of those people who doesn't need sleep; if I don't get eight hours I'm worse than useless, and if I don't spend a few hours socializing two or three times a week I get so depressed I can't bring myself to do anything but lay in bed.

My wife will tell me to do something and i'll keep thinking about it randomly throughout the day but then I'll come home and when I see her it'll click that I had another task I had to do which I forgot. My wife and kids don't trust me any longer to get stuff done, which is never a good feeling. My co-workers are starting to feel like this as well.

I've tried writing myself notes and leaving them in places that I frequent so that it jogs my memory but the post-it notes fall off or get removed and I forget about it.

It's getting pretty bad now, I've lost phones, notebooks, keys, etc. I'll be working and get up to get something or do something and half way there i'll forget what i'm doing and then go back to my desk only to remember a few hours later at which point i've missed the window or opportunity.

I've missed important meetings and have run into some problems at work because of my absent-mindedness. I never used to have this problem, or at least it wasn't this bad.

I recently began the [16 Point Program](http://www.kratosguide.com/16-habits-you-should-do-every-day/), something which I highly recommend.

For a couple of days I successfully completed the program each day using my own self discipline based on my determination to achieve certain goals. However, I started to become lazy and eventually procrastinated for days on end. 

This made me think, self discipline and determination are what success is built upon. But when you fall behind and procrastinate by loss of those two factors - to get back to where you were and achieve objectives you need more than self discipline and determination. 

You need other factors to **force** you to complete stated objectives.

For example, with college if you lack self discipline for studying for finals you will most likely fail the subject. But a factor which forces you to complete the objective of studying is in place - the factor of parents paying for you to repeat that subject or you going to summer school with your friends not doing so.

I only pose this question because there are objectives right now in my life which are vital to my success but self discipline and determination are not enough - I have no other factor forcing me to complete such crucial objectives.

I tried my best to be coherent and succinct.

Does anyone have a solution to the problem that you need more than self discipline to succeed?

Perhaps I need to tell people what I want and if I fail they will be able to know and that will bring shame upon me to then overcome.

Thanks!

This tip requires you to be able to set your morning hours at least a bit yourself, but you can probably make it work with regular office hours too.

The last few days I have set the alarm for 5 AM and gotten up right away. I do as much of the urgent work as possible for 2-3 hours. Then, at around 7-8 AM I go to sleep again for an hour or two and wake up between 9-10 AM.

Now, Getting up early to do work is not uncommon, as it offers a distraction free time when everyone else is still sleeping, but I found that the extra sleep after that gives an additional benefit: You get a ""second morning"" where you wake up stress-free and relaxed.

I jokingly came up with a slogan for this method too:

Too often I find myself starting something new, only to stop without being steadfast to the change. I stay in my old rut instead of sticking with what I know is better for me. But sticking with it is going to make me ""lack"" less and less as a person. I'm not going to be the fat/lazy/insert other adjective here person that I thought I always was. It's not the *starting* something new that's the key, it's *keeping with it* and making the new into something routine. I won't lose weight until exercise is just as much part of the routine as watching TV used to be. I won't stop being lazy until I am *constantly* improving myself. If, as /u/lvm1357 said yesterday, that discipline is not a destination, but the vehicle used to get somewhere, I need to strive for endurance. You don't run a marathon like a long sprint. You run it like a marathon.

It feels like I always assumed that if only I was a better person, or if only I found exactly what worked, then I would magically figure out a way to be disciplined. But instead, I have to work at making it last. Anyone can be disciplined for one meal, or one day, or one week. But keeping on with it when you may not want to, or when I feel like giving up, that's endurance. That's when I'm really disciplined to reach my goal.

As I quit my job here in the next two weeks to go back and finish my degree in two quick semesters, this is what I've got to remember.

I came to this realisation recently. I was preparing my CV/Resume and I reached the part where you discuss your hobbies and personal achievements. I had nothing. I don't play any sports, I don't speak any languages, I don't do anything that could constitute as a hobby. The only thing that comes close to a hobby is exercising, but I dont think going to the gym really counts.

I have taken up many hobbies and sports over the years, but each time I come to a point where I just stop. I dont give up because it gets difficult, I just end up not enjoying it anymore and it becomes a chore. Is this normal?

For instance, I began learning a language in my free time. I was interested for a while, but then came a point where I just said ""why bother"". I just felt that I would get more enjoyment out of 30 minutes of playing video games than I would from practicing, so why would I continue?

I kind of have a problem. Most of my friends would say that I am a very peaceful guy, and only very few do know that I do have aggressive tendency although I normally don't get in any fights. 

When I was in middle school, I was often picked on and was bullied all the time. Towards the end of middle school, I started to shut myself completly down and nothing seemed to affect me. But I really was just swallowing it all down and didn't let anything out. That worked for about 8 years and a lot of negative feelings have piled up and most of that time, I was alone, too (no friends). ~2 years ago I finally made some friends and I decided to try to let the positive feelings out, which was quite hard for me after a few years of isolation. Unfortunatly there also comes the urge to get in a fight which I have avoided quite well, because most of the time, we mostly met at the local pub, played games and had fun. But recently, my best friend got a girlfriend, who does have a few friends that I kind of feel attracted to, and they also like to go to partys and stuff. So I finally decided to go to some partys with them. 

And this is where my problem really starts. I do feel a certain aggressivity in the air, that I kind of feel attracted to. I do dance with the girls and try to have as much fun as possible, but I also feel this aggressiveness and it drives me crazy. And yesterday, I nearly got or got in a fight. Some random drunk (and aggressive) guy tried to hit on one of the girls and she stated a clear no, but he ignored it and remained persistant. He didn't touch her or anything, he only was standing in her way and stared at her. And then I started to stare at him and after one or two minutes he took notice of me and asked me what my problem was and I should stop staring at him. I kindly told him, to keep her alone, but kept staring at his eyes and he stared back and told me it's none of my fucking business. This went on for a short while, and suddenly I there was a rush of happiness or insanity, I don't know how to call it. I tried to surpress it, but suddenly I started smiling and he definitly didn't like it. He seemed stronger than me, I am 1.71m tall and weigh around 60kg no muscles, he was quite the same size, but seemed more trained. I knew that if he hit me, I would be down for good, but I couldn't stop smiling. I felt like a mad man. He asked me if I think this is funny. I kept smiling, and said 'sure, I am just waiting'. And then he tried to attack me. Somehow I evaded and put us both in a locked position where neither of us could do anything. His friends then pulled as apart, because apparantly they didnt want any troubles. Btw: they tried it the whole time, they knew that we were about to start a fight and kept telling me that I would lose and should just go away (I tried to, but he was blocking the direction I wanted to go and it kept starting again and again).

I kind of felt bad afterwards because I really enjoyed this confrontation. Can you help me with dealing with years of piled up hate and aggressiveness without getting into any trouble? Because I don't want to be like this.

I need help with discipline.,Cooolllll,41,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1d8uoz/im_cross_posting_from_rdepression_i_need_help/,"I don't know how to explain it but I feel hopeless to time. I understand there are only 86,400 seconds in a day and I don't feel as if I'm utilizing any of them. I always seem to compare myself to those of superior nature of either past leaders, friends, historians and philosophers. They accomplished so much by my age and yet I feel as if I've accomplished nothing. I've done things people would consider accomplishments but to me they feel as if they never existed. Most of the memories I have I feel they actually never existed or are made up in some fantasy land. That if I don't write down my past accomplishments or interesting days they will be lost forever to one false misfire of a neuron.

I feel lost, afraid, unable to accomplish even the simplest of things at times. I've been lucky enough I've been able to get up at a reasonable time everyday but I'm exhausted. Completely exhausted. My routine is falling wayside. I've been eating shitty, sleeping in, not mediating. My legs barely function and google tells me its fatigue from either anxiety or depression. I do not know if its depression making its way back, malnutrition (even though I'm eating a balanced diet most days) or if its something worse neurologically . I am always fearful and getting started on any tasks takes an enormous amount of effort as well as twice as long to accomplish as any other person. My mind always feels foggy as if I'm operating at half speed and my want to better my thoughts and intelligence are replaced with useless subreddits and one movie after the next. Being alone scares me terribly as I cycle through negative thought after negative thought and means of meditation, positive reinforcement and youtube videos to help break my perspective and thought patterns. I've avoided alcohol like the plague but my want to do drugs only ever increases. I believe its my want of escapism the same way I use to be addicted to video games and pornography. I've stopped both with incredible difficulty and replaced with workouts and reading. At times this feels like a mistake but I'm seeing better use of my time in the longrun yet this time feels wasted even after 'accomplishments' have been made.

All I want to do is find a purpose. A meaning to my life and to bring my goals back to fruition but I feel lost to do so. A want and need to do great things but the lack of a support system to do so. My inability to help myself and better my relationships with my family due to my negligence of egotism and isolationism. I never feel as if it's enough. Ever. All I think about are the failures and trying to gain gratitude for my semi normal situation doesn't even register. Hell, I went to coachella last weekend and all I felt the entire time was is this real? Will this exist as reality if I never took a photo? Just a figment of my imagination.

Getting my mind, my body, and my life goals past these daily speed bumps to try and accomplish the real goals I want to do but too afraid to try. Fear of success or fear of failure. Most likely the latter but who knows. I sure as hell do not.

I've made strides one day at a time by keeping a healthy work out schedule; usually 5-6 time a week. The fog tends to lift after I get the workout in but the positive effects of the workout are soon lost. Eating a healthy diet or a least trying to of foods rich in tryptophan(fish, spinach) as well as foods rich in antioxidants to stop free radical damage. I've done a lot of damage to my body and I've changed those bad habits for the better this past year with healthy weight loss but it still doesn't feel like enough. I seem to fill my time with useless tasks and errands to busy my time and even my supposed hour long workouts take two hours or more and all I ever feel is frustrated, alone, and isolated. I'm friendless and it sucks when I sit down to think about it. Any type of activity I can imagine to socialize to make friends has to revolve around alcohol and it bothers me. It's not as if I'm advocating being above alcohol but I feel social norms dictate drinking in order to have a good time and to make those who wish to be sober or at least a sense of sobriety feel insecure and diminished. Drinking only makes my thoughts worse in my mind and I do not want to pursue things that would inhibit my already delicate mental state. Elanor Roosevelt says ""Do one thing that scares you everyday"" and to me accepting my fears of rejection on this subreddit was one of them. Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

In reality, I need some advice on getting my life back on track. I have the capacity to become a doctor. I know I can. I left my job as a firefighter to do so but screwed up in college because of poor discipline and an inability to see the bigger picture down the road. I lacked the ability to sit down and do the work earlier rather than later and it showed on my gpa. I took the mcat but my score is too low for acceptance into any reasonable school. I graduated but my marks were low and now I'm left with the consequences. It's depressing. In reality I need to find purpose. Whether thats a new direction in life or to man up and repursue my goal again. I've tried to get my bearings straight but every attempt at job searching, soul searching seems to be leading no where. I'm afraid I might have to give up my pursuit to better myself for a goal I've been pursuing for almost 10 years now. It'll feel like I've wasted it all.

So my (horrible looking) resume is collecting dust, I haven't applied to jobs in ages, and while I've looked and discussed ideas, I haven't done a damn thing. 

Meanwhile, the rest of my life is pretty much plagued by this lack of...action. As obsessed as I am with order and cleanliness, my room is a disaster. I know where it's all at, it's just cluttered and not like me. My car hasn't had an oil change in 6 months and at least 7,000 miles. I've been on a health kick, and lost some weight dieting, but can't seem to find the will to exercise.

Pretty much every day goes as follows:

Workdays:

Wake up at the absolute last second. Get dressed, get ready, go, eat in the car on the drive to work (30-45 mins)

Work

Come home, watch tv, surf reddit, possibly eat. Surf reddit until ungodly hours of the morning until I pass out.

(Usually everyone is gone when I leave in the morning/afternoon, and asleep when I get home, so minimal human interaction)

Off days: 

Sleep until whenever I fancy rolling out of bed. Contemplate what I should do. Reddit. Hate self. Watch tv. Do laundry. Eat dinner with the family. Watch tv with the family. Reddit until ungodly hours of the morning.

I only get maybe 1 off day a week anyway. I always waste it.

I never go out, I don't even have friends. I don't have any money, never did anyway. I only work this job because I have to pay student loans.

And my resume...I don't even know what it should sound like. I wish someone would give me an example rather than just telling me what to put in there. I don't even know what a cv looks like, how it should be formatted, or what it should contain.

I always put the time it's supposed to end above the box **as i start it.** That way if i decided to make a sandwich or whatever and my break lasted an extra couple minutes it wouldn't screw up the whole list. I see no problem with taking an extra couple minutes in between them, because the actual list of checkboxes helps me remember what my goal is.
I put it right next to my computer while I work, and so far it's been helping me stick with multiple pomodoro cycles better than just the mental checklist. Having something concrete that you can see yourself  progressing through really helps you build up momentum. It feel great to check one of these off every half hour, and it feels awesome to relax for a few minutes in between so my brain isn't ground to mush. 

Hopefully this isn't wishful thinking, but I have an extension of this idea if it keeps working for me. Get the Seinfeld calendar set up, and do 8 pomodaros a day (that i decide that morning what needs to be done) whether it be 8 of trig, or 2 of drum rudiments, 1 of working out, 3 of trig and 2 of programming. As long as I get the 8 done a day i can keep my chain going. Since I don't have anything like writing comedy that I know I want to do yet (besides coding, I could do that), i think it would be better to keep my chain malleable and aligned with my goals.

Basically what I got from that thread, was that it was unrealistic to expect myself to follow the schedule I had set myself. I decided that I would aim for roughly 10 hours of revision per week.

I didn't exactly do very much from Monday-Friday, but did probably 6-7 over the weekend. Roughly 1/2 of one of my subjects revised, so I'd say I'm on track.

So yeah, just a little milestone. Probably the most work I've done in a long time. I've learned that schedules don't work unless you have an *extremely* predictable day. Every day. Much better to set a target and achieve it by a deadline IMO.

I live at my parents (cheaper with college going on), never really struggle for money, but I never really have a lot saved up, and I have good friends, hobbies, and two jobs. 

All this considered, I find myself in a bad mood too often. I am short with my parents who have done nothing but provide for me; I'm trying to get back into dating, but that's difficult with my time schedule. The biggest problem though, is school.

I am going for Engineering, but I don't know if it's really for me. Classes tend to bore me and are without exception very early, but I find the subject somewhat interesting.

To add to it, I feel like I'd be disappointing my parents if I quit, as they constantly harp on me to ""stick with it"". I get they want whats best for me, but despite my telling them it bugs me, they keep asking.

Basically, my jobs suck, school is boring at the moment, and the restlessness of living at home are all making me somewhat depressed.

*2. A scene or state of confused and violent movement or upheaval*

**So here's the issue: I live in a maelstrom.** Well, I call it the maelstrom. 

My big problem is focusing on one thing. You should see my room. I've got quotes all over the wall here, reminders, non-stop directives to myself. I've got calendars, task programs on my phone. If we're talking mental routines, I have an entire Google Doc full of that stuff that I read whenever I want/need a pickmeup. I am ambitious, focused, and I am disciplined. My life is a constant stream of discipline, *by god*.

I am just not disciplined on one thing for very long. It's more like: 

""*I need to work on my anxiety. I need to work on holding a more positive worldview. I need to call my friends more often. I need to workout. I need to read those books. I need to work on feeling less guilt. I need to work on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I need to work on Acceptance and Committment Therapy. I need to work on accepting myself the way I am. I need to work on self-trust. I need to meditate. HOLY PENIS, WHICH ONE OF THESE GODDAMN SELF-IMPROVEMENT SUBREDDITS DO I CLICK ON? ALL OF THEM? OKAY!*"" 

(several hundred man-hours pass, and then:) 

...

*""I need to work on setting priorities.""* 

There's an old saying, ""Chase two rabbits, lose both."" Well, I'm chasing a LOT of rabbits and I'm worrying whatever progress I make on them is being countered by how much I'm trying to do. Also, I feel like I have *many facets of myself that could use improvement,* and how can I reasonably neglect them? Any of them? Jesus, it gets me tired just thinking about it. 

So, yeah, my problem isn't getting motivated. That's pretty easy for me. What's hard for me is to *stick* on one thing. I'm writing this now at 5:30 am my time because I'm afraid that if I put it off until tomorrow (I have no idea when I'm going to wake up, that's a prob in and of itself) I won't ever post it. 

Right this second as I'm typing this, I'm asking myself, ""hmmm, is this really the right place to post this?"" But I have to start somewhere, eh? 

I take ADD meds, but frankly the focus they give is useful for barreling through projects, not getting to the next one. I'm living in the middle of a self-made maelstrom and I have no idea how to get out of it.

Mostly because I get bored so damn easily (you should see my subreddit list!) I tend to hoard up stuff and not use it in the future. To get anything done I have to lock myself in my room, because I know if I come down I'll get distracted. I look at the sidebar of this Reddit at the ""Other Subreddits"" and I **hope leaps up in my heart that one of them will have the answer I'm looking for. So I'll just bookmark this, and this, and this...**

Ah. *Damn.* 

You see my problem. If any or all of you answer this, I'm partially afraid that I'll make a list of notes bullet-pointed summarizing all of your arguments. And that'll go on the pile. 

Did I mention I'm obsessive and have perfectionist tendencies? My history tells me that finding solutions for my problems is a matter of combing through *piles and piles of data* before something clicks. Of course, this is probably post-facto reasoning and the solution is something terribly simple that I'm not aware of. 

I get the entire ""just take action, just do it bro,"" but it's a matter of taking and holding onto one action. Action-taking isn't something I have a problem with. 

(Also, I have issues with the entire ""Action precedes emotion"" theory. There are plenty of people who take plenty of action in the world but still feel rotten about themselves or their achievements because they hold the wrong beliefs about what they experience. I'm thinking about the person who wins 1st place in every academic competition but gets 2nd place in math and focuses on the silver medal because he has a cognitive distortion in play.) 

I get the entire ""prioritize"" deal, believe me, but my priorities aren't always the same, at the same time. If I feel like I'm putting on weight, for example, then my all-consuming priority becomes working out. If I feel like I'm being controlled by fear, then my priority becomes how to deal with that. My priority depends on what's happening around me. 

**Please, help me end the maelstrom.**

Ideally, I need a simple, basic step-by-step program to follow, one that could be applied for a wide range of situations (this should not contain the phrase ""JUST MAKE DECISIONS BRO, LOL""). 

A sorting algorithm, an Occam's cleaver, whatever you can provide, I'm not picky.

Or if you could just rec an appropriate subreddit that would be useful too.

I was posting high B's, low A's in university. I played soccer occasionally. Sometimes I would go to the gym. I was sort of overweight, the kind of overweight where it takes you a few seconds to decide whether they are actually fat. Borderline. I had pretty bad acne, but others had worse. Pretty bad hygiene, but hey, I wasn't gross. Every part of my life ranged from average, to pretty good.

I was **Absolutely miserable.** 

And then, one day, I tipped. It wasn't any major life event. It was everything all added up, an intolerable weight on my shoulders that I just couldn't shift another inch. I hated hitting 72% of what I was capable of, every day, in every way. I was done. Fed up.

So I just stopped.

I set high goals for myself, and then busted my ass to achieve them. A combination of self-loathing, fear, and sheer bloody minded determination got me through each day. Each set of weights I struggled so hard with. Each half an hour of studying that was so hard to focus on. I just, simply, did it. Day after day. Again and again.

Now, I'm here. I exercise every day. I study my ass off all the time. These are the major ones, I suppose, the ones you can connect with. I care for my skin religiously, and I'm slowly starting to see the scars and the disgusting blotches fade. I keep myself cleaner than Will Smith's rapping.

Today, I am making this post because I have decided to take another step. Again, nothing major happened in my life to trigger it. I simply got home from the gym today, and I realized that I waste so, so, *so* much time on the internet, and video games. So I've decided to stop. 

It seems so simple right? I can just stop. **I can just stop**. I have the ability to never touch a video game for the rest of my life. I just won't do it. I won't do it tomorrow, I won't do it this weekend, I won't do it this month, I won't do it this year. I'm going to take up a few hobbies that I have always wanted to do. I've always wanted to be a dancer, I admire them so much. I've always wanted to be a good photographer, so I'm going to do it. I enjoy cooking- I'm going to go buy a cookbook, and get cracking. 

I've been under this illusion my entire life that it is too hard to achieve these ridiculously high goals I set for myself. But then, I actually had a go at achieving one- and I did it.

So I'm going to do it again, and nobody is going to stop me. Especially not myself.

This post was for me, not really anybody else. If you don't get that, that's okay. I needed to put all my thoughts into a medium I can draw from when I'm at my lowest.

A bit of backstory: 

Throughout most of my youth and adolescence, I wanted to write. I wrote a goodly amount. Then AP classes happened. Then college happened. I wrote a little bit, but not that much. For the past three years, I've kinda-sorta participated in National Novel Writing Month (a TL;DR version of it is that one has to write 1,667 words of a story each day), and while I like to write for fun, I've fucking hated NaNo each time I've tried it. The whole thing feels like a slog through mud, with an empty pat on the back as my only reward. 

I've attempted to apply a ""nut up or shut up"" philosophy to my life since starting college. I'm very good at doing what people tell me to do. It's just that whenever I stop studying, doing homework, or practicing, or when I come home for break, I want to do jack shit. I don't *dislike* my studies, but I can't say that they bring me any fulfillment. Whenever I'm given a choice or an opportunity (that is to say, when my academic performance isn't on the line), I default to fucking around online or playing video games, because those are the only things that don't involve work. 

I fucking hate the fact that I'm doing this, but I can't think of anything that I enjoy enough to work on like my life depended on it. Whenever I try to work on one of the things that I tell myself that I want to do with my life (writing, music, etc), the whole thing turns into a mental death march. I'm not depressed, and as far as I can tell, I don't have any blatantly obvious mental disorders. 

Am I doing something wrong? I'm willing to work for a goal I think is worthy, but the only goal that I convince myself  *is* worthy is my studies (and, in my more cynical moments, my GPA). Nothing else seems all that worthwhile. 

Am I just lying to myself about what I actually care about? I'd rather not have to come to the conclusion that my true passion is ""dicking around online."" 

TL;DR: I have some sort of direction and discipline, but my direction seems more mercenary than genuine, and my attempts to find something rewarding aren't going too well. I'm frustrated and I'm not really sure what the hell I'm supposed to do at this point.

My life up until now has been for the majority very easy going. I slid through high school at the top of my class and graduated from a top ranked university with relative ease. 

I grew up when the internet started to become more and more available. I had that $9.95 a month Netzero connection for starcraft and cs 1.6. This led to a childhood full of hyper stimulation and constant entertainment. 

I'm 22 now and all of this has come back to bite me in the ass in terms of discipline. 

* I find myself endlessly browsing reddit even though I KNOW that I shouldn't be. The worst is when you are browsing reddit even after clicking literally every link and your mindlessly surfing a website where you have literally seen everything already.
* I find myself staying up late into the night even though I KNOW that waking up early at 4:30am to go to the gym makes my day 100x better.
* I find myself mindlessly browsing the internet even though I KNOW there are tasks that need to be done.
* I find myself late for events and appointments even though I KNOW I'm derping around on something stupid.
* I find myself daydreaming about the things I want but waste time doing other tasks even though I KNOW they are not helping me reach my goals. 
* I find myself giving into impulses like checking facebook, reddit, etc

So why do I want to be disciplined? 

* It's because I know that I'm happier when I'm disciplined. 
* It gives me a sense of control over my life versus me succumbing to some urge or impulse. 
* It's because I know I need to be disciplined in order to provide for my family and loved ones. 
* It's because I know I only have so much time on this earth and very little to waste.

I've again switched my sleeping habits and try to wake up and do something at 8:30 AM.

I'm now in a battle against my anxiety, stress and discipline. I get anxious when I try to bring myself ""up""-- my motivation ""up"" to get to doing something and when I try to get into the ""groove"" I get all jiggidy and tend to procrastinate (reddit/etc.) Stress, because I constantly worry and I really do dream high, I have a crazy imagination, my thoughts sometimes shapes what my feelings are. And discipline, should I move to extra measures to try to cap things off? For example, blocking sites like reddit and so on to prevent me from surfing (procrastinating?) this method is defunct, I think, because I know I'll find some other ways to waste time. If I do get to extra measures, does it mean I don't trust myself? All in all, I think relaxation is key.

I want to improve my discipline though and I'm having a vague distinction between what sacrifice is and what instant gratification does. See, I like to sing but I don't sing well when I'm stressed and therefore I seek instant gratification? But why can't I just sacrifice?

1347495274.0,36,self.getdisciplined,zsmsb,Staying disciplined in your fitness goals and other goals in life,FWS02,37,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/zsmsb/staying_disciplined_in_your_fitness_goals_and/,"I stopped by here per a general, open request in [r/Fitness](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness).


I've spent much of my life as a relatively sedentary individual.  I never got to be *severely* overweight, but through my teens and twenties, fitness and exercise were never a priority.  I had a high metabolism in my teens, and even through my twenties, I never got to be more than 20-25 lbs overweight.  Even so, I was a terrible athlete growing up as well... anything with a ball, I was bad at.  All together, working out and being active just wasn't worth pursuing to me.


My dearly departed father neglected his health for his entire life.  At his heaviest, he was probably 350 lbs… and it wasn't muscle.  He was a wonderful man and father though, and did everything he could to provide a stable and loving family life for his wife and his sons.  That’s something I will be eternally grateful for.  But he never took time for *himself*.  He maintained no real friendships, rarely took time to enjoy the vast joys in the world outside our family’s home, and wrapped up every conversation about introducing adventure into his OWN life with the words “when I retire”.


My father’s physical ability to take part in many of the joys of life was further limited by adult-onset diabetes in his 40’s.  Then, just two years shy of his retirement date – the date he would “allow himself to enjoy life” – he died of cancer.


The tragedy of my father’s life and his passing so close to retirement has guided the trajectory of my life in my 30’s more than any other event in my life BY FAR.  The power of this lesson was further cemented by the early passing of my fiance’s father, my best friend’s father, and 
parents of coworkers and others in the orbit of my life – all of these within a 12 month span.


To me there was one clear takeaway: **Do not let inaction rob you of your health or your ability to enjoy life NOW, ‘cause now may be all you have.**


My father’s passing was the spark… the initial motivation to start working out.  Not really knowing anything about fitness at this point, I decided to pick up a copy of a popular workout video series, that I’m sure many of you have seen infomercials for.  This proved to be a great start for me.


It was HARD… really hard.  I had pain and cramping in my feet and calves that made me want to quit early on, but I pushed through.  I committed myself to doing this for the full 60 days though, and I did.  At the end of it all I didn’t miss a single day. Some nights I had to work late I’d do my workout at 10 or 11 PM, just to get it in.


I noticed a drop in weight, a reduction in my waistline, an increase in muscle tone, and a **HUGE** increase in energy.  But, as this subreddit banner hints at, my motivation was not yet a discipline.  I needed something else to push me forward.  I latched onto another challenging video workout series and completed that as well, but these series were short and didn’t really offer any truly *longterm* goals for me.


I started reading and learning more about fitness, began creating my own workouts, and then I discovered mud runs and obstacle course races.  This was just an awesome discovery for me.


Over the course of the last two years, I’ve completed [Ruckus](http://www.runruckus.com), [Warrior Dash](http://www.warriordash.com), a 6 ½ mile leg of a Pittsburgh Marathon relay team, [Run For Your Lives](http://runforyourlives.com) and, my proudest achievement: [The GoRuck Challenge]( https://www.goruckchallenge.com).  An 11 hour, 21 ½ mile endurance event that opened my eyes to what I’m truly capable of.


*NOTE: I can provide a group photograph of my medals and patches from these events as proof if anyone would like*


It’s so easy to start working out only to lose focus and lose motivation.  I’ve done it many times in my life, and who knows, I someday may do it again (I sure hope not).  But keeping that motivation can, in a way be just as easy.  I’ve kept it going strong for two years now.  For me, it’s involved booking something on the calendar that *intimidates me*.  A concrete, non-refundable commitment that says “this is coming, whether you’re ready or not.  So get off your ass and get ready.”

This same logic applies to other adventures in your life.  How often do we have drinks with our friends and say “someday, we totally nee
d to do that!”  “Yeah, someday man – for sure.  We totally should. So anyhow… how ‘bout them Steelers?”


Fuck that!  Book it.  Make the call… make the plans… PLAN IT.  Book it.  Make these memories NOW.


In the last few years I’ve had more canoeing, hiking, biking, backpacking, wine tasting and other adventures than I can count.  My fiancé and I take camping trips at least 6-8 weekends a year now.  I manage a poker league with my friends… it’s a REASON for us 30-somethings to get together every few weeks.  It keeps us involved in each others lives, and is a great platform for us to plan new adventures, *together*.


I’m not saying everyone should get into mud runs, hiking or poker.  What I’m saying is that, FOR ME, having concrete commitments locked into the calendar galvanizes my commitments to better health and a better life.  Put something scary and/or exciting in front of you, COMMIT to it (come hell or high water), and let that be a light to guide you.  Hopefully this is of value to someone.  It’s served me well thus far.

**TL;DR** – The death of my father opened my eyes to the pitfalls of inaction and started me on the path towards a healthy, active, and adventure-filled life.

I've been trying to improve my habits and train myself to be more disciplined since the beginning of the year. I feel like I am making progress on my goals. The problem is, I live at home and I pay rent (roughly half of my pay check..because I need to learn to be independent), but my household is still entirely dependent on me for certain tasks. I don't mind pitching in at all....but usually the person wants me to DROP EVERYTHING and help them right away and I tend to snap when people assume that I am just sitting by idly.

I work, and my weekends are really the only time I really get to focus on larger tasks to accomplish. When there are no pressing matters to attend to and I've done all my chores, I spend a majority of my free time painting, writing, or working my art. 

As an artist (to note: I am academically trained and I support myself as an art educator at a museum. I am a professional and I sell paintings to supplement my income), I need a lot of undisturbed time and any distraction that pulls me out of the moment really pisses me off, to say the least. On any given day there are half a dozen or so distractions...someone needs computer help (on a subject I've explained to them at least 40 times)...someone needs me to lift something or reach something...or run an errand. 

Question: How do I politely explain to these people that I need my space to function and that they need to fucking do their own work and learn to be self-sufficient because my ass is leaving this house as soon as I have a stable savings fund. If they want my help, they need to value my time as much as I value my time and schedule a time when I am not busy.

Am I being an asshole? Am I being a little bitch? It was hard enough battling my alcohol issues in a household where vodka flows like water. It is hard enough to save money after rent, student loans, bills, and living expenses. It's been a lot of hard work to get to where I am at, and I just want to keep working hard...but its hard to keep the momentum and the motivation to tackle a task when I am constantly being distracted.

I was overwhelmed with all the classes I was taking and while prioritizing, I couldn't help to think and worry about other issues.

I think it was my lack of good diet, my push to stay up late and ""force"" myself, I could only do it a couple of times but in the end my mind and self rebelled.

I was doing really well in the beginning and mid-game of my schooling, I was sleeping well; conditioning myself for the better or worst but towards the end, I lost it. Maybe it was the anxiety of getting it over with or maybe it's my manic depression?

I don't want to say, but my therapist did diagnose me as depressive and have been recommended to talk with a psychiatrist. Money is really tight and while I play with the idea of visiting one and getting medicated, I am afraid of the money I would spend because I am simply on a budget.

Plus, the aesthetics of drugs, while it will help, is still not considered a permanent fix. So where does it all come down to? Is it my depression or is it my lack of discipline?

I think, discipline, I think I need to have a religion; albeit-- I've had enough of these false self preach but if this was the key ingredient that was lacking, I would have had this skill improved to accomplish tasks like my dropped classes.

I don't have a lot of structure in my life.

I haven't read much of the content people post up, but I think the fact there is a community where I can celebrate how disciplined I am becoming spurs my forward.

**What's Changed So Far**

The enhancements to my life because of this subreddit so far include . . .

1. I now do push-ups and sit-ups after every run. 
2. I read 30 pages of a book every day.
3. I work through my piano book about an hour every day.
4. I find time to meditate.
5. I spend less time browsing reddit and the internet.
6. I have a feeling of accomplishment at the end of every day.

**What I've Found Helpful**

So far, the greatest thing that has helped has been setting S.M.A.R.T. goals for myself. I can't remember the acronym, google it, but basically I just ask myself just what's a goal I can accomplish by the end of the day, or some other time period. A realistic goal, and when I accomplish it, I celebrate it.

Also, I've found the word discipline very powerful in and of itself. When I don't want to do something I should, or when I want to do something I shouldn't, I just start repeating discipline in my head until the urge to do the wrong thing goes away.

Most importantly, I have to be nice to myself. I think someone here posted a video about that. I really noticed how this has helped me stick with my piano so far, I actually kind of just enjoy playing. Before, I would get frustrated because I wasn't playing songs I recognized or liked. Well yeah, I gotta crawl before I walk; I get that now, and I can enjoy the crawling.

**Rating:** 4.5/5 Stars  

I'm posting this review to this subreddit because I love the community and I feel you all would receive it well and benefit from this book the most. I'll append edits to this review if I find anything else in my notes or if people would like more information in the comments.

As a disclaimer, I am making no money what so ever on this review. I just love to share things that have helped me with others.

**The Good:**  

One of the things that I dislike about a lot of self-help books it that science is always placed to the side in favor of anecdotal data. This book is not like that at all. It uses relevant studies and relevant data to explain the actual neurological conditions that make us do what we do, and consequently what we don't do. It was such a breath of fresh air in comparison to some of the more popular books out there. It was also so great to be reading it and having those 'ah-ha' moments of realizing why one does things.  

For example, it explains what activities capitalize on [dopamine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine) (watching TV, video games, eating, etc) to make us feel better. Yet after a few hours they tend to make us actually feel worse which is because the dopamine only affects the [reward system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system). Thus once the reward has been achieved, we no longer feel satisfied. This dopamine system was compared to the chemicals (serotonin, GABA, and oxytocin) which are released when doing activities such as exercising, playing sports, reading, spending time with family/friends, doing something creative and the like. The chemicals produced from these activities actually fight the brain's natural [stress response](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response) thus making us feel better over time not worse. The reason these activities are less enticing at first glance compared to the dopamine-high activities is because these chemicals aren't as instant as the dopamine ones.  

There were so many more of these breakdowns of things that humans do but this was just an example. If you love to know *exactly* why we do the things that we do and how to change that, I'd recommend this book whole heartedly.

**The Bad:**

There weren't a lot of bad things with this book. I would have given it five stars but I felt like there could have been a few more chapters. Currently I have a hard time pinpointing what I felt was missing but if I'm sure that if I gave it another read I'd be able to.

**tldr;** It was a great book and I'd definitely recommend it if you were looking to read more about willpower and motivation.  

**Self-Plug:** I love to read books like these, if you'd like to see more about what I read, add me as a friend on [GoodReads](http://www.goodreads.com/joshuad).

Too little, and you become a junkyard.  Too much, and you get burned out.  The optimal level is the most amount of discipline possible, before you burn out.

Anyone know economics?  When supply meets demand, that's the optimal price point where both buyers and sellers can agree on a price, and thus, business begins.

In regards to discipline, your dreams, goals, and life expectations are the supply.  They are the businessmen that come out in the morning and say ""I have dreams for sale!  One dream for 1000 days of work!  Another dream for 3 years of effort!""  

Your energy, brainpower, and motivation are the demand.  These are the buyers, coming to the marketplace each day.  Sometimes there's a lot of buyers (when you get a good night's sleep, your mood levels are good, your stress levels are low, and your motivation is high).  That's great right?

Not necessarily.  Because sometimes there's a lot of buyers, but NOT a lot of sellers.  Think of the times when you were COMPLETELY comfortable with your life.  You felt satisfied with each day, and you stopped thinking about your bigger goals and dreams for a while.  

What happens then is that these bigger goals and dreams go out of business, because there's no demand.  

Instead, less ambitious vendors come out - and maybe not necessarily the businesses you want to support.  These are dreams that say, ""Oh, I don't need that 6 figure salary after all, I'll be satisfied with just 5.""  Or, ""All I want to do today is play games.  I have that game boss that I want to defeat.""   Or the worst is, ""I don't really have any goals for today.  I just want to chill out, relax, and enjoy the pleasures of life.""

Now you may think, it's not so bad to support these vendors once in a while, right?  After all, everyone needs a break.

But the problem is, once you start supporting these smaller vendors, they start to MULTIPLY.  As economists know, when demand increases, so does supply.  And when supply increases, the price begins to drop.  

Suddenly, there's so many small vendors all competing for just a TINY price from your energy and brainpower, that the bigger vendors have no chance.  They've been cornered out of the market.  Your buyers have become loyal customers of the smaller vendors.

So the goal of discipline is twofold - the first is to keep the big dreams and goals from going out of business.  The second is to keep the buyers coming in and willing to make the big-ticket purchases.

Now how do you get this to happen?

Let's introduce a third party - the VEHICLES.  

The buyers are out there, but they don't all live in the same area, and they definitely don't all live next to the marketplace.  Some of them have a 5 minute walk, others have a 1-hour drive.  

In fact, your richest buyers - that is, your highest levels of energy and your best brainpower and your biggest motivation - these guys actually live very far - in rural areas, on private islands, or even out of the country.  It can take them hours to get to the marketplace, but when they do get there, *they* are the ones who can make the big-ticket purchases.

Hence, what you need now are vehicles, or methods of transportation.   There's slow vehicles - bikes, horses, rafts, and there's fast vehicles - airplanes and spaceships.  Now, who do you want taking your buyers to the marketplace everyday - horses and camels, or jets and rockets?

The vehicles represent another important factor to get your buyers to the market place - and these are the HABITS.

You might have some good habits already.  Brushing your teeth, eating well, waking up when your alarm goes off, etc.  These guys may not take the buyers all the way to the destination, but they definitely make up part of the commute.  Without these guys, the big buyers may not even be able to reach the airport.

But they're not enough.  Until you develop the killer habits that you need to succeed, you'll never be able to get the big buyers from their faraway homes to the marketplace.

So let's say you decide to invest in a fast jumbo jet. This is probably a killer habit - something like, working out for 2 hours every day, or waking up before sunrise and sleeping before midnight.  Truly an amazing habit.

However, while your big buyers may be happy to use your new jumbo jet, it's also a gas-guzzling machine.  It requires a lot of fuel.  Remember that motivation is not your fuel - motivation is a big ticket buyer for those big dreams, but it is not a fuel.

What is your fuel?  Attitude.  This is going to sound strange, but without any attitude your habits will go down in a fiery smoke after every launch.  Your buyers (motivation, energy) will get massacred.  You will become heavily discouraged.

Attitude - your attitude towards life, your views towards what's important, and your positiveness.  This is what will fuel your vehicles and get your buyers to the marketplace.  This is what will keep your sellers in business.  

So in the end, what is discipline?  Discipline is the government, which is YOU.  You have to create policies that help the innovative and ambitious businesses stay afloat, and push out the toxic and lazy ones.  You have to stimulate the buyers to leave their homes and go to the marketplace, each and every day.  You have to invest in vehicles that go faster and farther than the basic ones.  And finally, you have to find the fuel - the fuel for your vehicles.  And you can't just create fuel - you gotta find it.  

As the government, you have to manage ALL of these, and only successful management will allow you to truly succeed.  As another thread pointed out: discipline ain't easy at all.

You have a body, a mind and emotions that are constantly changing. Sometimes you’re motivated, sometimes you’re tired. Sometimes you’re up, sometimes you’re down.

If you’re down, you can drink a cup of coffee or apply a technique you read in this subreddit, and it can help you get back ‘up’, but it will be artificial and you’ll just crash harder and longer later.

Don’t use techniques or drugs to manipulate your body. Stop trying to squeeze so much productivity out of it. The harder you push yourself, the harder your life will get. If you keep going like this, eventually you will not be able to get yourself out of bed. It won’t matter how close the finish line is. You will be unable to move even a step further.

Instead, surf along your own waves. If you’ve got your inspiration, go and do something great. Once you’re tired, don’t panic, don’t force yourself, just rest. Move when you’re ready to move.

The key is to carefully choose what you do when you’re up. What do you do? Do you do your most important work, or do you browse Reddit? Do you spend your day’s supply of will-power actualizing your dream, or on procrastinating it?

Riding the emotional/chemical tides of your body while applying your energy towards your most important activity is real discipline. Sapping your body entirely of all its strength until you feel empty and dead is not. Carefully choosing how you spend your energy is better than trying to be more energetic.

TL:DR – Stop applying drugs and techniques to keep yourself disciplined. You’ll just crash. Instead, work when you’re energetic, rest when you’re tired, and apply your energy to your most important activity. This is the key to installing good habits and permanent change.

I got just about the best possible luck of the draw on life that I can imagine within reason. White upper-middle class male, free from any linguistically questionable gender identities so far as I'm aware, and to boot, real intellectual talents. I got into (early) college at fourteen, which, since I've only had one year interim, might be the most amazing thing I've done in my meager time here. Say what you will about social maturity, most of the kinks ironed themselves out pretty quick, but it did cast light on a pretty interesting problem that had been hiding hitherto inside itself.

Quite simply, I have had too much ease up to this point to have any sort of drive that actually lasts, because everything up to now has fallen so easily that when I stumbled upon something that doesn't, I generally just let it slide. The quote up there is, in this fashion, partially true: instead of regret, motivation faded into denial and occasionally depression and cursing of the loins whence I sprung if I was unfortunate enough to get shown up by someone else.

Recently I got my first D in a class where I actually was completely confounded for most of the goings and didn't talk to a soul until far beyond the critical point. I have reason to believe that this won't be repeated, ever, but I have now realized as a result that this time being spoiled by grey matter has deprived me of any, well, discipline beyond the most basic of social matters. Especially, I feel I lack what it takes (I guess the metaphorical fire) to keep going when, as they say, the going gets tough, or any stretch thereof.

Telling myself such overquoted tripe like ""if it was easy, everyone would be doing it"" and such does nothing. Posting anything on my desktop or commonly viewed location merely desensitizes me to it for the same reason. Honestly the thing that's perhaps most responsible for keeping me from seriously considering suicide is Camus' ""One must imagine Sisyphus happy."" Yet enjoying the journey as that dictates is hardest for me in formal study, just because every time I see something that I can't immediately assimilate my brain lets the melatonin out.

I'm not sure how arrogant all that just sounded, and I apologize if it was, but it's the truth. Frankly, for the first time in my life I don't really know what to do, and I feel like some relatively hard knocks may be coming my way soon. I know a lot of this may just be my tender years thinking they number more than they do, but frankly I'm not sure how much.

But the negative mindset that I have developed over the years really blocks  me on my path to success. I have an intense fear of failure and a fear of success, I'm always overwhelmed by the amount of work that needs to be done (always exaggerating the amount fo work to be done, leading me to procrastinate) and I always tell myself that my goals aren't possible, that I'm not good enough, that I'm not smart enough to achieve my goals. I know that in reality, my goals are possible and achievable but I just can't get rid of this negative mindset that makes me view life, my goals and myself in a really pessimistic way.

It really plagues me every single day. This negative mindset has affected not only my academic life but also my social life; it has really made me socially awkward. When people look at me, they see someone who is unhappy and depressed, and I believe the reason behind this is the conflicting internal dialogue that occurs in my brain, that tells me I'm not good looking, that I don't deserve friends, etc. 

What are some ways that I can overcome this negative internal dialogue that is composed of a fear of failure, a fear that I'm not smart enough, a fear that I'm a nobody, etc. how can I overcome it? I've tried to think more positively, but as a pessimist I feel that I'm just deluding myself and that I should just stick to the reality of the situation. I want to be more positive, but I can't, my reason always tells me that I'm being delusional. I need some advice on overcoming this. If any of you guys have overcame that negative mind-set in your lives it would be awesome to hear how you done so.

The philosopher mentions that if you are confronted with the choice between life or death, the samurai should choose death. By living as if already committed to that choice, samurais thereby become matchless warriors. Makes sense to me. He also says that even if you haven't achieved your life aims and you die, that is indeed a ""dogs death"", but you should do it anyway as a samurai.

That got me to thinking, have you achieved your life's aims? If I may ask, how old are you, what do you want to achieve in life (or what did you use to want for that matter), and how far along are you?

As for me, I'm 27, and I've lived almost two lives already. I used to want to be a concert musician, and got fairly far with that, but not all the way. I didn't like the lifestyle of a classical musician, especially being poor. I decided to switch paths to becoming a professional designer. Making that change was the hardest thing I've ever done, because I had to be a beginner again and give up getting the positive feedback from people for playing music all my life. Anyway, I've stuck to it for about 3 years now, and I can't say I don't regret it on occasion, even though I've been seeing a progressively successful outcome. The worst part is having people ask, ""why did you switch"" or not getting that recognition for achievement in music. 

My dream now is to have my own design agency. I work towards it little by little, every day. I never wanted to be the kind of person who is a dabbler or amateur at things as an adult, but I did not become the kind of person I thought I would be: the kind who does one thing very well for their entire life. So, life did not turn out the way I imagined, but I keep working towards a goal that I'm not even sure will make me happy when I achieve it, or if it is even possible. Maybe I started too late, etc.

Anyway sorry for the longish introspective story. I truly hope my honesty and candor however short inspires you to also write candidly about your own stage in life.

I'd guess that I use these websites for novelty pleasures. Also the addiction probably stems somewhat from my habit of procrastination, which I have unfortunately practiced and become accustomed to since I first started having homework assignments in 4th or 5th grade. I've always had some kind of escape from doing homework until I'm so boggled to get it done that I just go ahead and do it.

To suddenly stop using outlets to get away from school assignments seems distant and unrealistic. I actually can't produce a mental image of myself not abusing pandora, reddit and to some extent facebook on a daily basis.

I found some solace in the words *Done is better than perfect*. Of course that's not entirely true but when you are like me and don't even follow through with a lot of work that you promised yourself you would you need to remind yourself of that.

Hope you all had a good week of achieving goals, working hard, and staying disciplined. Personally, it’s been *mostly* a week of extremely hard work, with long library and gym hours- I can’t remember the last time I saw the sun.

This week’s tip has drawn its inspiration from the many times I haven’t succeeded this week. See, after a night of getting way too stoned, eating until my stomach felt as if it would burst, and missing my regular workout, I thought a little bit about failure and its importance in our lives. Thus, I bring to you:

Tip of the week (#2) - Embrace Failure.

If I were to hazard a guess, I would say that every single person reading these words right now has failed in some way, shape, or form today. From a dope-fuelled eating binge, to not finishing a workout, to something as small as slipping on your shoes instead of undoing the laces -what **would** your mother have to say about that- we all fail all the time. The trick to failure is understanding how to work with it, how to take advantage of it, and how to use it as a powerful tool instead of the curse it can seem to be.

Without failure, there isn’t success. For what is succeeding with no alternative? Failure is there to be learned from. Figure out why your energy shriveled up halfway through that gym session, and fix it- maybe you didn’t eat properly before? Experiment with different times of eating, different food. Maybe you were trying to lift too much. Don’t skip the next day out of fear that you will give up again. Why did I lose focus, and waste a whole day instead of studying for that important midterm? Maybe I need to be in a space that allows me to focus. Maybe I should get rid of some distractions. Maybe I should try different methods of studying. Why did I just eat an entire box of cookies when I am trying to cut weight? Maybe I should let myself eat a few cookies occasionally; maybe I shouldn’t be buying the cookies in the first place. Maybe I shouldn’t go grocery shopping hungry.  Don’t give up on your diet because of one slip- instead, use that slip to strengthen your resolve to reach your nutrition goals. Don’t take away negativity from your failures, use them as a tool. Don’t fear failure. Embrace it and learn from it, and that will give you the power to get yourself back on the right track time and time again.

When you really think about it, most of your learning does come from failure. I know most of mine does. Those lessons that are ingrained into me the hardest came from me horribly fucking up first- and when I look back on all the times I let myself down, I realize that without those instances I wouldn’t be the person I am today. My failures and successes define me in equal parts. I like to live my life based on the idea that if I hadn’t absolutely cocked it up a dozen times before I got it right, I probably wasn’t aiming high enough.

Now, what about you guys? How have you messed up, and used it as a learning experience? Do you fear failure, and if you do, why? What are your thoughts on using failure as a tool instead of trying your best to avoid it?

Good words, mostly in order. In need of an edit, and some polish, but they aren't words I need to throw out or decide ""this is practice, not 'real' writing.""

(At the time of writing the above it was last evening. I have since edited the words and polished them. There's now 1437 words. I did more than just add a sentence- I rewrote and moved things about a little, and didn't just give up and toss it. And I'm *proud* of the words).

This is the longest in years that I've kept words and added on to them. Part of me wants to write more as soon as possible and try to get this done. Part of me is just terrified. I keep flitting between making this a short story I can finish asap, and a book with more substance. But I don't know the type of book it would be- probably one of those where each chapter is almost a story on its own, and skips months or years, so a whole life is shown.

But then, can't I write those chapters as short-stories?

Either way, I have words for now. I have some plot stuff worked out for another story too, and found out that leechblock can be meta-blocked (so I can't just turn it off when I want to go back to reddit or fanfiction.net). Finals/essays are eating up a lot of my time, but in a week-ish I should be free.

I found a super self-publishing site as well, where you can publish-as-you-work. So if there are short stories, one can add more, etc.

(Mostly it's used by programmers who need to keep their work literally up to date).

I like it because it's pay-what-you-want (with the author getting 90% [-$0.50] royalties). So I can set a minimum price, and anyone paying can give me more if they want. I do plan to make the minimum $0, and see if 'pay *if* you want' will be viable. But that's my personal side-project. We'll see if I can make that work, but that's for later.

As for the story that has 1437 at the moment,

Push through the pain and challenge yourself.

PUT THE PRESSURE ON YOURSELF, BECAUSE LIFE ISN'T GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU.

You must transcend this human tendency, working hard in spite of all rationalizations and excuses your mind gives you to try and preserve energy. 

You will never be able to truly control your life until you are in control of yourself.

When your muscles go unused for a long period of time, they atrophy. The same is true for your willpower and discipline. Understand that in order to become stronger, you must challenge yourself every day, or face the alternative. 

If you fail to put pressure on yourself, you will fail in all your endeavors, and only work as hard and as intelligently as you are forced to by others.

Unfortunately, holidays are pretty much over and it is a new year. Why not start it off by giving your life a spring clean a few months in advance? 

Tip of the week (#3)- clean, de-clutter, organize.

Every single one of us can relate to these three tenets- we make messes, we accumulate a lot of crap that we don't need, and said crap (as per the second law of thermodynamics) tends to lean towards being in a scattered state of disarray. There are countless TV shows spun around this topic, from hoarders- a TLC staple- to shows where old Scottish ladies clean your house. We are, as a society, obsessed with organization and cleanliness and all that good stuff. If you haven't already, it's time to jump on the bandwagon.

To start off your purge, de-clutter ruthlessly. Throw out the shit you do not need! I guarantee there will be a lot of it. Do you really think you are going to re read those old magazines? Why do you have 4 pairs of running shoes? How thick is the dust on those boxes in the basement? If you think about it, if half of the things you owned disappeared overnight, you might not even notice. They say to feel rejuvenated, you should throw three things away. A good technique for clothes is to hang everything a certain way, and flip the coat hanger around when you  wear something. If you find that in six months something hasn't been warn, take it to a thrift store. 

Hopefully now you are down to the essentials, the things you need. This makes the next step easier- organize. Keeping organized is a major component to keeping discipline in your life. It makes everything easier, run smoother. Put things in their proper places. The less you have, the easier it is to stay organized. Don't develop complex organizational systems, they never work. Keep it simple. 

Finally, clean everything.

Now, a good foundation for discipline in life is to address these three tenets daily. Allocate 15 minutes a day to clean up small messes, to tidy up. Every month, take stock of your belongings and, at the very least, get rid of three things. This small 15 minutes a day will help you streamline your life, and enable you to be more efficient.

I will focus on my school work and exercising only

Today, Monday June 3rd 2013, I am starting a week long project that will end June 10th, 2013. For the next seven days, I will not watch any TV, play any video games, watch any YouTube videos, watch any porn, browse reddit or do anything of that nature. My goal is to get a head on my school work, make substantial progress on my two long term goals, increase productivity, and to work on defeating my greatest weakness: procrastination.

I have made two long term goals for this summer semester: get an A in both of my summer classes and to start working out regularly. For the exercising, I did not make a specific goal of pounds or reps on purpose; my goal is to stick to my diet and work out plan religiously. I would be more happy if I missed 0 work outs and cheated on my diet 0 times than getting ripped. As I said before, my academic goal is to get an A in both of my classes. I have macroeconomics and some bs online class for Microsoft Office. Not too hard right? I guess, but they move extremely fast and I have gotten a bit lazy. I am doing well in them, a b in macro and an a in the online class but this is not good enough. I need an a in macro and I need to be substantially ahead in both. Maybe that will happen this week. 

This may seem like overkill, but that's the point. There is a specific weakness I am targeting. When I chose to procrastinate, I am faced with 2 options: do what is difficult and strenuous or do what is easy and painless. I have chosen the second option consistently (until the last minute, where I scramble to get it done). Every time I chose the difficult option, I become stronger. Every time I chose the easy option, I become weaker. I have become weak, and that is not okay. This week I want to grow stronger


Okay I forgot a few things. I do not think that those leisure activities I listed above are bad things. They are not these evil monsters our generation of degenerates has ruined our lives with. Many of them are passions and hobbies of mine that I enjoy and value deeply. The whole point of this is overkill. It is supposed to be difficult. Why? To show I can do it. Also, I may watch YouTube videos about exercising or ask /r/fitness for some help. That is encouraged, as long as I don't get sidetracked to other stuff. Lastly, I am aloud to do social shit, as long as I have gotten my work done for that day. I have become even more scared of social situations. I have become so scared of socializing, I lost touch with a few friends. In addition to socializing, I can read books and do other self improving activities if I have gotten my work done.


Edit: I encourage you to join me. Pick something then go all out for a week. Why? To show that you can. If you are thinking ""uhh I don't think I can do that"" or ""uhh that sounds like a good idea but it sounds like it sucks"" then you really need to join me! Prove that you can.

disclaimer: im listing all my faults as quickly as possible for you to understand my mindset and the degree to which my motivation lacks.. 

I Reddit daily, skip University classes every other day, have no qualms about handing in half ass'd tests and assignments, zero fucks are given about study. I sleep to midday at least everyday because my current schedule allows me too. I have a part time job in which i understand my role and its importance so I work hard at it, however it is simply a job for the sake of having a job and I only work 3 times a week with 3-4 hour shifts.

I laze around the house in trackies and a dressing gown most of the time currently ( admittedly its due to the house being ridiculously cold, with or without the heater on ). i have no motivation to change, just the desire and empty will. i live at home with my Mum so all cooking, cleaning or otherwise is done for me, i game too often for it to be called a hobby. i do not work out other than a weekly game of basketball i do with friends on sunday's, training's are not included in that. 

I smoke marijuana and have it under control, ( I don't do it every day, but i also don't use it as a reward system for myself, which i would like too ). My friends are similar in their partaking, yet most of them are motivated and have clear goals in which they wish to achieve.

i have a goal, and that's to finish my studies of Games Design and Development with a PhD, eventually..... key word being *eventually*, when it should be **as soon as possible.** My uni schedule is only two classes over three days ( though my Maths and Physics for Games class pretty much takes up about the effort of 3 classes to get outstanding work, yet still i only do the minimum ). It's not a lack of wits as to why i only do the minimum, just a lack of applying myself.

i need help. plain and simple because no matter how much i say im going to do something its either done with the least amount of effort or not done at all.

Steve Jobs once said,*paraphrased:* &gt; I give the hardest jobs to the laziest people, because they'll find the easiest way to do it

however i believe im almost a lost cause, not just a lazy person.

**TL;DR:** I'm 19 and my life is one lazy or incomplete wreck, without any motivation to succeed in where i would like to, and the pressing need to get motivated doesn't phase me in the slightest.

I'm posting I suppose more so I can just get everything out and lay it flat for myself and at least hold myself accountable in some way, not just subscribe to the sub, think ""that'll be useful"" and forget about it.

Among my many bad habits I think my worst is a pitiful combination of laziness and procrastination, and now that I think about it they're quite intricately connected. I know what I want, vaguely. At the moment it consists of graduating high school and getting in shape. That's about all I know. I don't know if I want to even attend a post-secondary institution let alone what specifically it is I want to do. But I don't get to sit around going ""mehhh, I dunno"" so I've applied to a few art schools since that's what I've said I would do for a while. But I feel like I've just done it for the sake of applying to something. I don't entirely mind it, but I'm not particularly motivated to do it. And that scares me because art is the only thing that I know I'm passably competent at. 

Anyways, aside from all that, aside from the fact I know I want to graduate and never look back, I'm still procrastinating on all my work until the last possible second and even then some. I know it's really self destructive, but I've seemed to convince myself that I'd be able to fix it at some point in the future or that I work better under pressure or something.

I've got so many people yelling at me from so many places to get off my ass and do something and I KNOW it's a matter of self discipline. I don't know where to start even. I know I need to get it together, but it's terrifying when I can't even imagine myself post high-school doing anything productive.

The key idea behind this one is that you can form discipline for difficult tasks by making them easy FIRST and slowly building up.  A person wanting to take up exercise should probably not say they're going to go to a hard 2 hour workout straight away, but commiting to walking to the letter box and back every day is a good easy start, then to the end of the street, then around the block and then build up the distance once one doesn't feel overwhelmed by the task.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,Star,True,t3_zmqeu,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/zmqeu/i_posted_these_a_while_ago_in_getmotivated_but_i/,

I have loved this community and really appreciate the insight you all provide when reading comments and so on. The support network is great and it's easy to see why there is nearly 50,000 people subscribed.

I found a gap in the Motivation Hub. A place where we can share our goals as a whole, not necessarily fitness specific but social and so on. I decided to work on something called The Challenge, where using 6 month blocks, I actively try and complete goals I have set for myself.

After reading through /r/Seduction, it's clear I am not the only one tired of trying to find a good place to do this without being spammed with affiliate links and bullshit information.

So I created /r/ThePDChallenge

**The Challenge**

* You have just under six months till the end of the year. That's a long time to actively change, even if you're working your way up from a poor stumbling jog to a solid, average paced run. The potential you hold in this next six months is incredible. 

* Create a series of attainable, realistic goals that are relevant to your overall 'quest' in life and work to complete them within the six months.

* Build positive habits, a healthy lifestyle through the advice, support and inspiration from other users.

**ThePDChallenge Subreddit**

* Post using the provided formats and share your story. 

* Read other reports and success stories to inspire and motivate yourself.

* Report regularly to hold yourself accountable. Meet other people and set up support networks to motivate yourself when needed.

* Provide positive feedback to others and help solve problems when needed.

There is no affiliate links or promotion of anything there. I hope to keep it that way as to provide a place where redditors alike can share their stories of self improvement and personal development. A place where we can go to be inspired and find support for issues we run into, whether it be direct answers or sub recommendations. 

I hope to see some of you there, check out the wiki and sign up for the six months ending in December!

I’ve been lurking faithfully in this subreddit and I’ve noticed something that a lot of people are neglecting in their discipline projects and could benefit IMMENSELY from. For simplicity, I've added the TL:DR right away...

 **TL:DR – You will remain miserable as long as you believe that success or fulfillment is just around the corner. Fulfillment, or true satisfaction is available (literally) now, or never. If you are suspending your happiness for when your goal is fulfilled, your goal will eternally recede into the horizon.**

If you are dissatisfied with being fat, don’t mistake your fat for the problem. The real problem is how bad you feel about your fat.

It doesn’t matter how much will-power you have, how many techniques you know, how many books you’ve read, or even how determined you are. If your action stems from dissatisfaction, it will only deliver more dissatisfaction.

If you are waking your ass up and going to the gym every morning, believing that it will be worth it once you drop some pounds, You will sabotage your own progress until you give up and fall back to ground zero. It will get more difficult, more frustrating until you give up. You cannot win when you are fighting yourself.

When creating permanent change in your life, nothing is more important than the state you are in while you are creating it. Successful, thin, rich, healthy, influential people already felt good before they did what they did. What you create is a reflection of how you feel.

This doesn’t mean to resign and stop trying. Nor does it mean to give up on yourself. You can create your life in any way you wish – it’s your god-given right as a human. What it DOES mean though, is to **stop being so cruel to yourself and your life immediately and find a way to feel good about it** – maybe even have some fun with it.

Maybe make a list of things you’ll miss about being a smoker once you stop smoking – and at least enjoy smoking as long as you’re doing it. You won’t be able to smoke later when you stop smoking, so enjoy it now.

If you relapse and eat a box of Oreos or spend $200 bucks on something stupid, there’s no use in hating yourself. Enjoy it! Let it be! Relish it. Don’t push it away, get all the way into it.

This isn’t bad advice, it’s good advice because until now you've been moving endlessly between discipline and relapse all on a steady undercurrent of self-loathing. It's the self-loathing that has been keeping you stuck. The advice is to **be kind to yourself and see for yourself how much more effective it is than treating it like a piece of machinery.**


You’ll remain stuck as long as you’re having a bad time, being way too serious, not laughing. People who have what you want to have are people who have lots of fun and laugh. They don’t suspend all of that for an unknown time in the future. They have it all now.

You can have it all. You can be every bit as successful as you’d like. But stop waiting for it. Look for it Now. Get your head out of the future and bring yourself here, now. Relax and go with the flow. It’s coming. It’s coming, it’s coming, it’s coming.


**TL:DR (again): Stop torturing yourself for the future, it’s futile. Results appear to those who live in the present moment. Direct all of your attention to how you feel now. If you focus on feeling good, then you are (finally) in a position to receive all the abundance you could ever desire.**

Any advice or tips would be greatly appreciated,FelEdorath,31,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/13sz64/i_waste_far_too_much_time_on_the_internetcomputer/,"I end up wasting so much time on the computer, espicially on certain websites.

So I've tried blocking them, which does work, but as soon as the block ends (whether it 3 days, 1 day, 3 hours, 30mns) etc, I often find myself going back on, and then I have to go through the whole ordeal of blocking it again.

Just keep your computer off? A nice idea in theory, but doesn't work often due to 2 reasons

 1. I often have to look up information for my study, and even if I ""save up"" all my researching/questions for like a 1/2 hour studying session, it's still quite a few times in a day considering if I'm studying all day long.

 2. It is actually very easy just to boot up a pc.

So yeah.... I know I need to just get off sometimes, but just because I know that, doesn't make it any easier. So please don't let that be your advice to me, because it's like telling somebody to fly, it doesn't work......

This article is from Harvard Business Review and is purporting the benefits of meditation for business professionals.  An extract:

*""Meditating daily will strengthen your willpower muscle. Your urges won't disappear, but you will be better equipped to manage them. And you will have experience that proves to you that the urge is only a suggestion. You are in control.""*

The essence of the article is that since meditation requires you to focus on something simple like your breathing but your mind inevitably flits to other matters.  Meditating trains your mind to focus and be disciplined by resisting distracting urges though the practice or returning to your breathing when your mind wanders.

I think this could be an interesting supplementary exercise for us to improve how disciplined when doing particular activities, so I think it would be good to try it!

But my main thing is fantasy. I've been working on three different novels for a good amount of time now. I just can't seem to progress much on them whenever I sit down to write.

I'll get on, go to imgur, go to reddit, facebook, youtube, watch Netflix, whatever, and I won't write. I have trouble with grad school homework for that reason. The only thing I'm disciplined in is my daily workout.

I guess I'm just so easily discouraged by what I write. Not because I'm a bad writer, but the opposite. I'm discouraged about what I write and I'm kind of afraid to be successful writing.

Stephen King wrote that he writes 10,000 words a day, or a thousand. I have trouble even writing 200. :/

Perhaps this is the proper venue.  If anyone is interested in making some good goals and giving other feedback, leave them below.  Thanks!

***

In the end of 2012, Motivational speaker Zig Ziglar passed away and I started looking him up because I was shocked at how the passing of this cookware salesman from Yazoo City was news to [CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/28/showbiz/zig-ziglar-obit/index.html), [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/07/celebrating-zig-ziglar.html) to my father.  Turns out the guy was really big about setting goals, and I looked around and decided to start setting some serious goals for 2013, (not something vague like ""Get my shit together"") and I'm wonder who's coming with me?

**Should you get serious about setting some real goals?** - It's been said many times that if you fail to plan you plan to fail, but few people come up with real goals.  If you want better information, hear it from the man himself in his goals videos from the 80s:

&gt; ""For 24 years I was 'going' to lose weight. But, it wasn't until I wrote it down ... put a date on it ... listed the obstacles I had to overcome... Identified the people/groups/organizations I needed to work with ... make a plan of action ... set that time limit, and ... identified the benefits to me, it was only when I did that that a goal became a reality and I lost the weight"" - [Goals 1 of 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae-VJ_lauCw)

&gt; ""The people who wait for changes out there before making changes in here are the ones that will end up [like biscuits what fail to rise].  The rule is simple 'You do it now'."" - [Goals 2 of 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiQV0oTyd98)

&gt; ""You can't make it as a wandering generality, you must be a meaningful specific"" - [Goals 3 of 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su2UuP3aqZg)

**How would you get serious about setting goals?** - Most of this is adapted from [this article](http://www.goals2go.com/articles/zig-ziglar-goal-setting.htm) 

**Part 1.** Dream - figure out all of the possible things that you would like to do.  Think big. Spend a week working on this so you can wring your brain like a dish rag. During this next week devote at least two private sessions to dreaming. We want you to create a Dream List filled with ideas. Your list should include at least 25 dreams about what you want to be, do or have.

**Part 2.** Why? -  After you complete your list, wait 24 to 48 hours and read each item on your list and answer the question: Why? If you can't verbalize in one sentence why you want to be, do or have this dream, then it's not a dream and it won' become a goal. Cross it off your list.

**Part 3.** Question - Ask the following five questions of every dream on the Dream List you created last week.

1. Is it really MY goal?
2. Is it morally right and fair to everyone concerned?
3. Is it consistent with my other goals?
4. Can I emotionally commit myself to finish this goal?
5. Can I ""see"" myself reaching this goal? 

You must answer ""yes"" to all five questions for each dream, or cross that dream off your list.

**Part 4.** Categorize - Ask the following seven questions of every dream that remains on your Dream List (or goals list). Will reaching this goal . . .

* A. help me take a step forward in my work?
* B. make me healthier?
* C. make me happier?
* D. win me more friends?
* E. give me peace of mind?
* F. make me more financially secure?
* G. improve my close relationships?

Now if you can't answer Yes to at least one of these questions for each dream, eliminate that dream from your list. **But**, also write the letter A-G next to each dream that remains on your list so you can see what category they belong in.

After asking the questions posted part 4 you will have eliminated some of your dreams. Actually, they were not goals, just thoughts or desires.  At this point, you're better off without them.

**Part 5.** Time Range - Separate your remaining list of goals into one of three categories: Short-range (one month or less to achieve this goal), Intermediate (one month to one year to achieve this goal), or Long-range (one year or more to achieve this goal).

Remember: Some goals must be BIG to make you stretch and grow to your full potential. Some goals must be long-range to keep you on track and greatly reduce the possibility of short-range frustrations. Some goals must be small and daily to keep you disciplined. Some goals must be ongoing. Some goals (i.e., weight loss, sales success, education, etc.) may require analysis and consultation to determine where you are before you can set the goals. Most goals should be specific. A ""nice home"" is not as good as a ""3,000 square-foot, Tudor- style home with four bedrooms, three full baths, and two living spaces.""

**Part 6.** For the goals you are going to pursue fill out one of these [goal setting worksheets](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11885920/Goals%20Worksheet.doc).  And be really thoughtful about it.  

Be sure to work each goal through the process of the chart. Be selective. You may not be able to work on all of your goals at one time! Don't over do it. Don't overemphasize one area. If you only have time to complete one or two goals for the remainder of this year, don't apologize. Do a little bit more than you can, but do not overextend your time to the point that you don't complete any of your goals. Do not get frustrated by the process! Work the system and it will work for you. 

**Part 7.** Setting the goal - Everything else was just determing what is the right goal to pursue, use the questions below to create the actual goal.  **Copy and paste the lines below to share your goal** and say what you are going to do with as much detail as possible.

***
**The Dream of What You'd Like to Achieve**:

- Specific - What is the desired result? (who, what, when, why, how):
- Measurable -How can you quantify (numerically or descriptively) completion?:
- How can you measure progress towards completion?:
- Attainable - What skills are needed?:
- What resources are necessary?:
- Are you prepared to make the commitments necessary in order to achieve?:
- Realistic - What obstacles will you face?	:
- Time Certain - What is the date you will achieve?: 
- Final Goal (Begin goal statement with ""I'm so happy and grateful now that…"" state goal in present tense: ""I am.."" ""I have…"", etc. and must include date goal will be achieved)

Here's my situation. I *need* to get motivated both on a short term basis and long term basis. Short term, I'm in debt and need to make money. I am self-employed and actually have a ton of work on my plate that I've been successfully avoiding for weeks coming up with lame excuses for my client. Long term, I need to execute on my bigger scale plans to make big time money and not just ""pay the bills and live month to month"" type money.

I've tried different kinds of to do lists before. They actually work fairly decently but I eventually trail off and stop using them. Ironically I'm actually really good about getting to the gym and doing workouts (as in like bagging out maybe a few times a year) so I *can* have good discipline in certain areas.

So I'm here to get get myself out of my current serious rut that I'm in. I tend to underachieve in general but recently I'm way worse than usual and I'm looking for the help and tools to right the ship.

I think the reason this has worked so well is that it highlights the two key types of willpower I have observed.  Specifically speaking:

-  Exercising intensely has given me the strength of will to push through when I am finding something difficult.  When I make an aim to run a certain amount I am not getting off that treadmill until I have done it.  This is useful when you are doing a challenging task - you can just power through and not give yourself a choice!

-  Dieting has helped me fight that little voice in my head which tries to tempt me to give in.  This has always been a bigger problem for me than powering through because you basically convince yourself that giving into temptation just once isn't just a big deal.  Unfortunately, this can snowball pretty fast.

The other change which I have made is to really start of at a low, easily achievable standard with any goal which I have, and to gradually make it more difficult until I have reached a level of practice which I am happy with.  So for example, I am learning spanish vocab using a frequency dictionary deck on anki (definitely recommend this btw!).  In the past I have tried doing 100 words a day but after a few days I burn out.  So instead I started at 20 words and every week I increase the number by 10%.  This gradual change in difficulty hasn't been noticeable at all.  I have just started doing this with running as well now and it's working out great!  Part of the reason I fail at being disciplined is because I set myself tasks which require too much commitment for my current level of willpower I think.

Anyway, these changes have helped me a lot so just wanted to share them, and was wondering what has helped other people kickstart improving their discipline?",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_11lao7,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/11lao7/what_changes_have_you_made_which_have_most/,

When I occasionally get  overwhelmed in life (this never goes away, no matter how disciplined you become, you just learn to manage it.) I always remind myself of two things:

 - Failure is always acceptable. In most cases, EVEN IF YOU FAIL, your efforts will not go unnoticed. It's always better to try and fail, than to do nothing. You'll learn a hell of a lot more about yourself from a failure than an easy out. Get used to failing, learn humility, brush it off!

- Half-Assing something is better than ignoring it. That being said, THIS  IS NOT AN EXCUSE FOR APATHY! Sometimes, when I feel tired, or cranky and I dont want to... lets say, go to the gym, I remind myself of the GOALS, and that even if I go and only give 40% of my normal effort, its STILL better than doing nothing at all.The next time i attempt a task I will give it more effort and build up momentum into being accomplished, proficient and disciplined.

I'll use this one instead. Sorry.

A while ago I told you guys about a week long project I wanted to do. [I posted about it here,] ( http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1fl2b1/operation_overkill/?sort=confidence) but the general concept is that for a week I would not browse reddit, watch TV, porn, Netflix, YouTube or play video games. I have 2 summer classes this semester. I wanted to make good progress on them so I have more free time. Also, I wanted to work out and become more disciplined. I can't call the project a complete failure or a success. I did learn a lot though. 

**A lot of things went wrong, and a lot of things went right. I will try to keep this as brief as possible, because I tend to ramble a lot. See Im doing it now. My apoligizes.**

As /u/Dysruption said, I can't jump out of a hole, I build stairs and climb out. I knew going into this I might mess up, but I also knew I would get right back up again. 

It stared off great. I kept a log for the first 2 days of my progress. I did break my terms a few times, but for the most part I did great. I got a whole chapter of my virtual class done, with a 100 on the test.

My tablet was having problems so I desided to back it up and reset it. I did that, and lost the log I had of the first 2 days. The general jist of what went down is a broke my terms less and less each day, and got shit done. I downloaded a new app too keep progress of what was going on. 

My tablet was having more issues, so I called tech support. Tech support said to reboot it again. The app I got this time said it backed up. Well that was a load of shit, had to pay extra to back it up. At this point I had none of the logs at all. I am sorry about that, but I known that this sub tends to be a bit more mature and would understand. I didn't want to distract from my work by stressing over the fact that I could not show reddit my progress. This is for me, I'm just telling reddit the story along the way, if time allows for it. Sorry guys!

Towards the end of the week I started to burn out a bit. I was tired, sleep deprived, and lonely. All of my friends were either working at the same time as me, grounded, or out of town. I got to sleep early Friday night, because I had the ACT the next day. **Here is where shit got intense. Story time.**

I woke up that day, and got pumped and ready for the test. I convinced myself I was doing alright and that I would kill this test. All was well. I got into the car, and I dropped my cell phone into a cup of coffee. Then I herd my mom freak out. The car I was going to take had a flat tire. For some reason, ACT told me to go to a different school across town to take my test. I had no idea how to get there, and this car had a GPS. We found an old Garmin GPS, and I took my moms car. The GPS was old, and it stopped working. I followed a few cars that had kids in it, and I managed to get there on time.

I start taking the test, and I realize I was mistaken for the other kid in town who has the same first and last name as me. (No relation) I have accommodations for extended time, but I did not recive them. FUCK!!! I told the test admistration lady and she said to finish the test then call them and cancel it. I had to stay there, but the test would be canceled and not graded. I half heartedly did the test and went home. I was so depressed. I rested, and took a break from this project. I watched some TV and played some games. I got some food, and went back to work.

**I ended up finishing the whole virtual school class that night. I did the last 2 chapters of it. I ended the class with a 97 or something. I am so proud!**

**For my on campus class, I had a quiz and a test that week I got As on them and I have a 94 in the class now.**

**I did not start working out.** My parents said I am getting teeth pulled on the 13th. I firgured I would focus on school stuff so Im not stressed after the procedure. I might recover faster.

1366825593.0,21,self.getdisciplined,1d0tzn,Any one else find they perform better when competing?,GetCompetitive,27,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1d0tzn/any_one_else_find_they_perform_better_when/,"Hi Guys,

I have been thinking about competition and how it related to discipline, and was wondering if anyone could relate to it, or maybe even want to do something about it.

Whenever I look back on my life, I always seemed to have performed best and stayed the most focused when I was in direct competition with someone else. Whether it was against someone in some sort of althletic field or academically. A couple of years ago, I lost a good bit of weight just because my friend was also doing it and I felt a bit of informal competition with them. In school I considered myself to be one of the top students, and if I saw someone coming close to my level I would go into studying like crazy to maintain my position. Even better yet, if I was ever knocked from the top spot, I was even more motivated to get it back.

The problem is, now that I am a little older and there is no one to compete with directly in some areas of life, I can find myself being complacent. Sure there is the whole ""you're only in competition with yourself"" thing, but although somewhat correct, it is not particularly motivational. In fact, it may be quite unmotivational. I just don't seem to do to well with the 'soft touch' abstract motivational/disciplinary techniques. They work for some, but I just dont respond very well to them in the long term.

I think it really depends on the person. I could imagine for some people being in competition would have the opposite effect. Don't get me wrong, the motivational quotes and courage wolfs and motivation buddies, etc are all fine and good, but I tend to find their effect is only temporary. Theres nothing outside of yourself to keep you on track. Once the initial burst of enthusiasm has died down you are back to square one. The same for the various disciplinary techniques here. Many of them are very good and practical tool, but there just doesn't ever seem to be the motivation to keep at it 24/7.

Nature has ingrained us to compete with other people. Whether it be for food, resources or sex. If we can exploit this fact, we can harbour the power it provides and do great things with our lives.

Ideally, what I would be interested in is to see if anyone else can share my sentiments. People who are fulled by that primative need to compete and be the best. What I would really be interested in, if there is a lot of support, is maybe putting together a buddy system or maybe just creating a group. All it would require is some sort of shared goal and parametres which are agreed by everyone. Just a nice it of friendly competition (of unfriendly if you respond better to it ;))

So for example, what if you found a buddy (or several buddies) to compete with and your competition was to stick with a gym routine more strictly than them. Maybe over a 3 month period or whatever. You could put together a shared spreadsheet on Google docs and award yourself a point for every time you go to the gym when you are meant to. Personally I prefer to measure things like 'going' to the gym, rather than competing over who can lift the most or whatever. that way consistency is encouraged rather than anything else. That way you can compete with anyone at any skill/physical level. You could even possibly put a ""prize"" at the end for the person who ""wins"" (although everyone is a winner really, as we are exploiting that competitive drive to improve ourselves).

Naturally, the whole system is based somewhat on a level of trust. As I said though, there would be no point in cheating, as its not the goal of 'winning' you are striving for, but the goal of doing whatever activity it is consistently. So if you cheated, as cliche as it sounds, you would only be cheating yourself. There may be some goals where you can actually give objective evidence of your activity, eg those running GPS phone apps, or if its to write 500 words of a book or something. Those sorts of competition are even better as its measurable. For stuff like 'study for 2 hours per day' it may be harder to verify, but again, people who would cheat are just cheating themselves. If anything it would spur the other person on even more, and with friendly competition between people I don't think that would be an issue.

I suppose it would be simular to those trackers that people post here from time to time where they award points and things for each day they do all their stated goals. However it would be 2 or more trackers, side by side. with any combinations of activities, rule, point systems, etc.

Anyway, if anyone thinks this sounds like a good idea or would be interested in a 'Competition Buddy', then let me know and we may be able to put something together. Otherwise maybe I'm just weird and get off on competition. If it is REALLY popular I might even look into building a website around the premise or a subreddit, where people are paired up and competitions are run between them.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1d0tzn,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1d0tzn/any_one_else_find_they_perform_better_when/,

i am reading this because i currently have no enthusiasm for reaching my set goal. i realize that i am in a completely different mental state than i was when i set out to achieve my goal. my excitement has been replaced by apathy- but the fact that i am reading this means that i still want to achieve my goal, DESPITE my current negative mental status. i realize that this low i am currently going through is part of my path towards reaching my goal- if achieving goals were easy, everyone would be doing it. instead, i am one of the few who, despite the temporary hardships and failures, refuses to give in and quit. i may be at my lowest point right now, but the mere fact that i am reading this means i have NOT given up on my goal- and the fact that i haven't given up on my goal, even at my lowest point, means that i will be certain to achieve it. this will get me through the worst of times, and i will continue to fight on until i get through the darkness and reach the light. i acknowledge that it is very difficult to carry on when all seems hopeless, but reading this will serve as a reminder of the way i felt when i first decided to achieve my goal, and i know that once i am out of this dark place, i will again feel that surge of energy and enthusiasm, that drive, that shiver of pure excitement and euphoria that i had when i set my goal in the first place. it will all return when i climb out of this hole. i am beginning to displace negative thoughts with thoughts of success, of hope, of the rewards that i am seeking. i realize that thoughts of success, hope, and goal achieving CANNOT simultaneously exist in a mind filled with thoughts of fear, doubt, and negativity- if i am to reach my goal, i must now work to push out negative thoughts by filling my mind with thoughts of a positive, goal-centric nature. i will take a moment right now to clear my mind of all thought, by closing my eyes and focusing on counting to 10 deep breaths, while allowing all thoughts that come up to pass on, without interacting with them.

[DO IT]

now that i have cleared a bit of space in my mind, i will work to fill it with positive memories. i will take myself back (in my mind) to the time when i first set my goal. i will remember how i felt, how i made a PROMISE to myself to achieve it, and never give up.

now i am beginning to feel the gradual return of those same feelings i had when i made my goal; of excitement, hope, and a burning desire to have the object of my goal. i remember the sheer intensity of those feelings, and want them to return. i WANT to keep working towards my goal. i WANT to achieve it. i WILL NOT let failure, feeling low, or external circumstances stand in my way- i will find a way around ALL obstacles, no matter WHAT. i will NEVER give in to defeat. the fact that i am reading this at my lowest moment is testament to my true DESIRE to achieve my goal, no matter what. even though i may go through dark times, i will ALWAYS come out again, even stronger than before. i recognize that i have just now dealt with the invisible enemy- the one who tries to trip you up, hold you back, and stop you every step of the way- and no matter how strong a grip he may have had on me when i began to read this, his grip is now weakened. it is a FACT that his strength is entirely proportional to one's awareness of him, and knowing this, i resolve to expose him whenever he tries to sneakily trip me up, and i eagerly await his next appearance- as i know that it will merely be another opportunity for me to conquer him, thus making me stronger, and him weaker. i will now take a moment to smile and appreciate his clever attempt to stop me from reaching my goal, and feel a swell of pride and satisfaction come over me, as i have just made it one step closer to my goal. hell yeah!",,False,,t5_2uzju,1349816964.0,,,True,t3_11065v,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/11065v/wrote_this_this_morning_to_help_me_when_i_dont/,

**EDIT**: Just as a follow up for anyone just tuning in: I've begun making my way through the book and I (and a few others in the comments) definitely recommend checking it out. So far, the book has told me that there is a part of you that does not want self-discipline and uses a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde analogy to describe it. It then goes on to say that the trick is not to completely shut out Hyde (the part of you that doesn't want self-discipline) but instead learn how to recruit Hyde as your ally and use him to support your self-discipline.

I figure that because I did it so profusely for such a long time I just sort of gained the ability to take notes on autopilot. They're accurate, too, I read them again after class and they're pretty much verbatim whatever I was reading/hearing.

I've tried to concentrate on what I was writing when I was writing it, but it's way too easy to get bored out of my skull and just zone out and let my hand do all the work. It's not good though, because even though I have the notes afterwards I'm not really learning during the lecture and I think it's been hurting my test performance.

I'm using Evernote to keep track of my system. In one note I have a table with two columns, the first is a task, the second is the reward.

For example: 

* study for 2 hours - 15 mins of game time

* study for 4 hours in one day - 1 Netflix episode

* wake up before 7 AM - 15 mins of game time

* wake up before 7 AM for five days in a row - take half a day off

* get more than 90% on an assignment - add £15 to the game budget

(I'm a university student in case people are wondering)

I keep track of the rewards I have earned in another note. When I spend them I alter the note.

I've tried to make it pretty balanced. I know that if I make it too easy I will just exploit it, but if I make it too hard I will abandon it; for example, I usually get a lot of work done the day before a tutorial, so my reward for going to those is to have half a day off (when I have time off I allow myself to do whatever I want, even if I don't have the rewards to spend, but I'm not allowed to gain any rewards during that time). I can choose to save up the rewards for however long I want.

I would appreciate advice, especially from people who have had reward systems for a long time. One of my problems is that I have a hard time sticking with this sort of thing; sometimes I'll have a bad day and throw my system out the window, other times I keep changing it so much that it turns into something else.

I'm also pretty unfit and eat badly. I don't help enough around the house and I don't look after myself well.

Also i didnt sleep till 4 and didnt get up till midday. Im not saddened by this setback though. I just gotta reset the slate and start again!

Generally fall asleep at 1am try to wake up at 7am usually manage to wake up at 9:30am if I am lucky, the latest is usually 11am.

I have tried cold showers to get my body jump started.

&gt;Do you have any guidelines on how to create good goals?

I'll cover the answer to that here.

When you're coming to create the first draft of your goals list, the idea is to grab as much as possible.  You want a long list that you can then trim down.

**Step 1 - Grab it all**

If you could have everything you wanted, what would you have?

If you could change anything in your life, what would you change?

What would you change about

your body

your finances

your relationships

your influence on others

your career

your impact on the world

All your dreams and desires, the girl, the car, the mansion, the life, the fame - whatever you want.

Set a timer for up 20 minutes and write non-stop all the things you'd like to achieve.

**Step 2 - Prioritize**

Written down everything you've ever wanted?

Good.  You can't have it all.

Go through the list and ask yourself the question

**""How much better would my life be if I already achieved this goal?""**

I personally used a 1-10 scoring system where 10 was basically ""living the dream"" 4 was ""about the same as it is now"" and anything less than 4 was ""worse than now!"".

**Step 3 - Sort**

Rewrite your list with the 10 stuff at top and the 1 at the bottom.

**Step 4 - Condense**

You're probably going to have some overlapping goals.

For instance:

- own a mansion

- own a superyatch

- ferrari

- overseas holidays

- retire at 35

All of these are wealth related goals, so condense them down into a single financial related goal.

- lose weight

- get a six pack, massive chest and arms

- bench 200 pounds

Are all fitness related.  I'm sure you get the idea.

**Step 5 - Pick your projects**

I like to think of big goals as projects.  You can break them down into smaller goals or milestones and set time lines and allocate blocks of time during your week to work on them.

Also if someone asks you ""What are you doing"" and you say ""Trying to get rich"" you might get an odd look but if you say ""I'm working on my wealth and investment project"" I bet you'll come off as more mature.

But as you block time during your week to work on these projects you face a problem, you have finite time.  It's not smart to spend 5 minutes a week on 200 different projects (or maybe it is, what do I know?), but it seems like if you can't put in an hour a week into a project it's probably not worth it.

The idea is to start with maybe one or two projects, if you can consistently put in more than an hour every week start thinking about adding in more projects.

**Step 6 - SMART goals**

Really I think putting the hours in to your projects is the recipe for achieving them but if you want to go a step further with your planning you can make your goals SMART

Specific

Measurable

Attainable

Realistic

Time-based

The idea is that you make sure your goals fit these criteria so you can measure your progress to ensure you're heading towards your goal and it wasn't too crazy.

**Step 7 - Make them part of you**

1367966491.0,23,self.getdisciplined,1dw5kx,Just decided not to go to my midterm because I didn't feel prepared,FailingMiserably,44,21,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1dw5kx/just_decided_not_to_go_to_my_midterm_because_i/,"I had a midterm this morning and decided not to go because I felt I wouldn't do well. I'm on the quarter system taking 17 units and due to my lack of discipline, one of my math classes has suffered. I feel like whether or not I succeed every quarter hangs by a shoe string. I wouldn't consider the class to be difficult material wise, I just haven't put in the time to learning it well enough to be proficient. The other problem is, I give up so easily with so many things, it's frustrating. Same thing happened last quarter with a different class that I am currently retaking and getting an A in. I often think to myself, ""Why couldn't I just put in the proper effort the first go around?"" Instead I choose the path of most resistance. I don't know what to do. My gpa is taking a temporary hit while I makeup these classes, not to mention, I'm trying for a math minor and I probably seem incapable or, at minimum, look really bad in the eyes of the faculty.  
  
I've considered a few options:
1) I can take one less class each quarter. This still leaves me with full time status, however, it pushes out my graduation date by quite a bit. I'm an older student (Turning 26 soon) and my age is always weighing on me.  
  
2) Somehow confront my discipline issues and power through hoping next quarter gets better.

Edit:
Update 1: Had a long discussion with my professor and decided that it would be best if I retook the course. Just so happens that the guy teaching it next quarter is one of my favorite math professors, so I don't really mind. 
I've made a few changes to my current habits that have been immediately beneficial to my current work load. Thank you for all of the advice and recommendations.   
  
Firstly, I've purchased [The Now Habit](http://www.amazon.com/Now-Habit-Overcoming-Procrastination-Guilt-Free/dp/1585425524/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368262556&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+now+habit) and have started reading through it. I've heard nothing but good things so we'll see where this takes me.

That heavy, depressing feeling you get when you are browsing Reddit and all you see are purple links, so you are about to just keep clicking the next page button to look for that one blue link? 


Then there is that moment of clarity right before you click it where you know that you should be doing something that moves you closer to your goals; like working on your homework or tweaking your resume or exercising.


You realize that, what was just going to be a quick check-in on Reddit that morning had somehow turned into half a day of youtube and memes. 

But for that one split second, you attain a glimpse through that haze of apathy that seems to permeate your brain, an all obscuring cloud that has hung in your mind for as long as you can remember having been on Reddit. Like a beam of sunlight cutting through the morning fog, you see the truth, the future that awaits you if you continue to do what you have done for so long. 


You understand for that moment that you have two choices, you can continue to the next page or you can close your browser and make headway toward your dreams. 


That moment, the one you have experienced time and again but chose to ignore, is a despite call for help from your hopes and ambitions. It is a blanket being thrown over the embers that are your dreams and aspirations.


But you have the power. You have the discipline within you to say NO, to close your browser and use the anger of those wasted hours to fuel the flames of you passion. 


So take advantage of that split second of clarity, don’t think about it, don’t contemplate whether you really want to get off of Reddit, instead, just do it. Close your computer, get up from your desk or out of your bed and do the first thing that comes to your mind that will get you closer to your goals.


You **will** return to Reddit. The fog will come back but each time that moment of clarity will last a little longer because you gave it strength and purpose last time around. And with each cycle, the draw of Reddit and the all obscuring haze will lose their power over you. Your discipline will become firm and you will wonder how you allowed yourself to waste so much of your time on something so meaningless.


Maybe now is that moment. Maybe now you can see how far from the path you have strayed. Maybe now, you can begin to work toward your dreams….


Or maybe you will just click the next page button…. The choice is yours.

**Pavlov Pomodoro Type A**

For each Pomodoro, roll two 6-sided dice at the start of the Pomodoro and also at the end if all 25 minutes is completed without cheating. If the dice roll turns up double sixes, immediately reward (in my case with a delicious Reese's peanut butter cup). If the dice turns up doubles of any other number, re-roll. Then continue with either the work or break phase of the Pomodoro.

Well this morning I've gotten up at 7:30, thus completing the first day of the challenge.

When I went to bed yesterday, round 12:30 I wasn't sleepy at all, the consequence of a rotten sleep routine, and I did something I haven't done in a long time: read a book. There is plenty of research floating around suggesting that phone and laptop screens stop the production of melatonin (the hormone that induces sleep). Putting that to the test, it seemed that it worked. I put my book away round one and was sleeping round 1:30.

To give a bit of background information, I'm 19 years old, not in college, addicted to Minecraft, and terribly with a lack of discipline and motivation. 

Before you say anything about college, there's a bit of a backstory to that. I have been enrolled for University for my first year, getting a gpa of 2.5 (first semester), and 2.02 (2nd semester). I slacked off and didn't care and the only thing I wanted to do was go back there because I hated being home. I stood home for one semester with a part time job and going to a community college, lying to my parents that I did well whilst I slacked and skipped classes for most of the time. I just happened to see what I got for those classes and it was 2 B's, 1 D, and 1 C. Not the best grades. I convinced my parents to go back to Uni for the next semester and my slacking followed. I managed to get my gpa up, but only a measly 2.18. That's where I am now. I wanted to go back to Uni just because I didn't want to be home. I will not be able to go back to any college next semester missing the deadline for any other colleges and deciding not to go back to Uni for my own good.

As of life in general, I'm a game addicted, lazy, and unmotivated s.o.b. I spend most of my free time playing any kind of game I can get my hands on, just to keep time going by. I wake up at around 11am-12pm and I don't even brush my teeth. I just get a bit of food to get the taste out of my mouth (gross I know). I get continuous lectures about my life and myself from my parents. And they're right, I've done nothing good with my life ever since I went to Uni, even before.

Back a few years, I was put into baseball for a bit of fun and self betterment. I loved playing baseball, don't get my wrong. I started to dislike it after getting horrible teammates who would make fun of, and one incident, put dirt in my hat and glove. I was defenseless and just cried to my dad. I was out of baseball for good, until I was taken to another league (surprisingly better). This happened to be the time I was also a senior in high school. I was enrolled in both the High school team and other league team and I resented the H.S. because they were a bunch of jokes. I didn't get along with anybody on the H.S. team, nor a bunch of the others in the league (only until later). Thing is, I didn't really want to do any baseball that year, I was pressured by my dad because I didn't make decisions myself. During that year as well, I was put in a baseball academy to help better my skills, costing over $1,000+ that my dad payed because he thought I was going to do something with baseball in the future (aka college).

Today is the time where I have to make a decision. I have no job, no money and there's a bit of a big decision I have to make. My dad decided to bring up the idea of the US National Guard or Reserves. One or the other. I don't know if I want to make that decision because I would still love to go to college and hopefully start better since I would be having a job to pay for college as well. I have an appointment to ask them a few questions about the reserves, but my only reason for going would be for money, not going for a career there. I have no phone due to rage from my parents (good thing), I'm restricted when they're here, but I do whatever I want when they're not.

I know I am to blame for all that has happened to me. I have wasted so much of there money for college (around 30k), baseball (2k or more), and for the college I went to back home (3k). I have a slight idea of what I want to do with my life. My goal is to graduate college with a masters in Psychology, move to Canada, and just live life from there. That's the master plan. But with all that is going on so far, that plan just doesn't seem... probable. I have done a few things to change my perspective on life. I hated going to the gym, but after going a few times with my brother to Planet Fitness, I quite like it and want to get a membership myself. I have tried to cut down on game time, hardly playing my Xbox, hardly watching television, trying to pick up a few books along the way.

So my real questions would be...
1. What can I do to change my life around? Starting from the little things, I want to stop being lazy and addicted to my games and focus on things that will actually help me, like the gym for instance.
2. Knowing I've messed up in college in both grades and money, how can I reassure my parents that I really do want to do better in college and that my grades won't suffer like they did before?
3. Does it look like I'm a failure in my life? I feel so bad that I've done absolutely nothing to make myself better in life and now I'm paying for it.
4. Are there any tips to make my dream of Psychology and Canada a reality?
5. Would the US Reserves be a viable option to even think about? (I honestly do not want to do it, but it seems like my only choice)

I arrived at this subreddit not expecting to find much motivation but it's rather different. All the advice on finance, lifestyle and work have enabled me to realise what i can achieve with just a little bit of effort. 

So i've started to turn it all around. Ive clamped down on spending, started journalling things i do and want to do and most of all, im kicking myself every time i start thinking 'I can't be arsed with that'

Here's a small document ive made on Google docs to help me organise my life. Just a list of things that i want to achieve in a day. Obviously they are not all always achievable, but knowing that im striving towards a goal is a great motivation.

Im now riding a bike to work every day instead of driving, that's helped massively for the bills and the fitness is great! I'm eating a healthy diet of foods that i actually still like, im on top of my spending and am saving a healthy £10 a week (not much but its a start!) and im finally cracking on with all the hobbies and projects that I never had the drive to finish before. 

I don't believe that I am anywhere close to being wise enough to try and impart wisdom and advice to you all but I do want to say that this subreddit and it's sister sub's have really helped me out.

I'll revive the series but won't limit it to a set day.

**Do you have a written list of goals that you look at at least once a week?**

This is a pretty clear question.  You either do or you don't.  Ask yourself and give an honest answer.

I asked myself this question a few weeks ago and realized that I had various old goal lists on my computer and on bits of paper in my files but I didn't have a single list that I looked at frequently.  I had a list on my phone, a list on my computer and a list in my diary.  What I didn't have was a single list that I looked at frequently.

That's changed now.  I got myself a piece of paper and started a fresh list.  I keep it in my back pocket at all times, I've pulled it out and I am looking at it now.  I feel like there is something powerful about carrying it around, making it part of my life.  When I get an idea or a thought about something important, I note it on my bit of paper - it's not just about goals but about habits I could improve, areas of my life that deserve more attention and random motivational thoughts.

When my bit of paper gets full, I transfer the best stuff onto a new sheet (each sheet gets more tidy, more structured and becomes a more elegant document).  I personally keep my old sheets so I can look back and see my goals evolve over time.

The thing about written goals is that everyone knows they work but few people have them.  It's one of those things that you really only ""know it"" when you ""do it"".

So you'll come away from reading this and I will either convince you to have a written goal list that you carry around with you or you will decide that this post is just rehashing old goal stuff you already know.

Your move.

I keep trying to fix things by spending more time preparing for my Thursdays. This last week I made sure to finish all of my work before Wednesday so that I could spend all of Wednesday after class relaxing to mentally prepare for the stress.

**tl;dr before I ask for help so you can catch up: Thursdays, 12 hours of class with a 2 hour break. Stressful as fuck.**

The idea is to write down how long it takes you to do each thing. This way you might notice things you can cut down on (preferably not work).

You can then calculate how much free time you had that day (free = not doing any of the things listed), and how long you spent working. This would probably be a good idea for people who feel like time just keeps slipping away.

 * Fapping -  I am currently 5 days through my current NoFap streak. It has been relatively easy so far, as until recently, I have been wasting so much time procrastinating &amp; gaming. I do expect, however, that it will get harder soon.

 * Watching alot of movies &amp; tv - I have blocked all those sites, so that I wont waste anymore time on them!

 * Over-eating - I have done really well in this area. I have cut back down to what I used to eat &amp; am eating much healthier.

 * Procrastinating - Realistically, I actually haven't had to deal with this so much recently do to other distractions. However as I get more focused, I will struggle with this more and more I fear. But I do have some stratigies planned to help me in this area.

**Some more goals**

 * Exercise regularly

 * Get up early &amp; have devotions &amp; plan out the day

 * Dont go on computer early in the morning or late at night

 * Tidy room &amp; keep it tidy

That can help, but from my experience the main practice of good time usage, decision making, anti-procrastination sits with the mind. 

Problem: We live focused on instant gratification most of the time. The instant we want food, we immediately put food in the microwave. The instant we want to listen to a song, we immediately switch to it on our mp3 player. The instant we want to see something interesting, we refresh our reddit tabs. We practice this pattern most of our lives: **Desire -&gt; Grabbing onto the desire -&gt; acting on desire.** 

This pattern causes at least two secondary problems. First, the pattern causes us to latch onto every desire automatically, and we see this in ordinary terms as “distraction”. Second, the pattern causes the desires to stick around longer, since we've learned we act on them inevitably. 

Solution: In short, the mind needs to let go of desires. A desire arises and you just don't grab onto it. **You focus on something else, preferably your more important task. You step into the pattern and disconnect the second step. And if you haven't done this before, you have to learn. No one can really explain how to let go, it's something you have to experience yourself.** 

After doing this for a while, I found something strange. **If you let go of most desires, it's just as good as having fulfilled them.** Many desires don't have any reward, or such a fleeting reward, that they don't even matter if you go and do them or not. Obviously this won't work with biological necessities, but with everything else, start practicing with it if you can. 

Once you've seen this for yourself, you can let go of wanting to play video games and reddit all day. You can let go of that. You don't get that much reward from it, believe me. Want to refresh those tabs? Don't grab onto that desire. Let it pass. Just as good as having done it. 

I do want to clarify that letting go has a “near enemy” in trying to push away. Trying to push something away won't help. It's just another desire to grab onto. You'll still have to let go of that. 

Another thing, meditation can teach you a lot about letting go, and /r/meditation and /r/buddhism and this article http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebmed022.htm can inform you in that regard. I learned this from meditation, but people can learn this as a skill outside of meditation as well.

I wanted to offer, partially for my sake as well as /r/getdisciplined, my experience after one month.

I have arrived at a template, of sorts, to my daily logs.  Each page contains:  

* The date and day-of-week
* The day's 24 hours, in two 12-hour columns, one line for each hour
* Log for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and space for any snacks
* Space for daily tasks, including [Most Important Task](http://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/)
* Space for tracking daily exercise
* A block of four-squares, each representing an activity that must be performed each day of the week (breakfast, exercise, reading 1-hour, meditate 10+ minutes).  When I fill all squares that day, I fill in a square drawn on the page edges, which I use to track in [chain format](http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret).  My chains are visible with the book closed.

I have been using the facing page to record any observations I make during the day.  So far these have been reflections on my success or progress, recording failures, challenges, etc.

A few observations I have made:

* In one month, I completed my four basic tasks 53% (toward the end, I gave myself two cheat days for exercise as I feel right now daily exercise may be overly ambitious.  Factoring for that, I completed 59%).
* My average internet consumption (in Chrome, not including limited tablet browsing) on days where I complete the 4 daily-tasks is **327 sites**.
* My average internet consumption on days where I don't complete the 4 daily-tasks: **433 sites**.
* My weekend browsing has increased.  Am I saving weekday browsing for weekends?
* I have read two books, and am part-way through a third.  I have always struggled to complete a book a month.
* For exercise, I have been jogging, biking and body-weight exercises (squats, pull-ups and dips).  I have found my ability has increased in all of these areas.  I have not yet started tracking my weight.
* I have recently had a few bouts with mild depression.  Between daily /r/meditation, and being able to track my daily accomplishments, I have found my general outlook is much better, and I am finding myself looking forward to setting new goals.

I just wanted to share some of my experience with the /r/getdisciplined community.  If you have any questions, please ask.


**EDIT**: By popular demand, images!

* [Generic page template](http://i.imgur.com/FsVVYnl.jpg), displaying the main areas and ways in which they're used.  When actually used, the page is much more filled by the end of the day. The 4 squares are my daily activities, and the two circles next to square #2 are my exercise cheat days.  Once those circles are filled, and I miss a day (ie. &lt; 5 days of exercise/week), I put $5 into a pot, to be unlocked when I beat a previous chain.

&gt;if you set out to complete a goal, the only thing you CANNOT do (if you wish to achieve it) is give up. anything else is fine, as long as you don't give up. because the instant you give up, is the instant you FAILED your goal.  
&gt;
&gt;however, don't construe this to mean an all or nothing approach is the way to go- quite the opposite in fact. why? because an ALL or NOTHING approach means that you have two options- perfection or failure. neither of these is remotely acceptable. 
&gt;
&gt;why is perfection unacceptable? because it quite simply is not going to happen- it's impossible. if you don't TRULY believe this, then why haven't you already achieved everything you want in life? if you could do everything perfectly, you already would have.
&gt;
&gt;seeing that neither perfection or failure are acceptable ways to achieve a goal, we can see that an ALL or NOTHING approach is simply not going to work. therefore, we need something else.
&gt;
&gt;rather than setting out to do ""PERFECT"", set out to do ""DECENT"". ironically, this is actually harder. why? because in a perfectionistic mindset, anything less than PERFECT is failure- therefore, when you say ""I want to do DECENTLY"", you only hear ""I want to do LESS THAN PERFECT- aka FAILURE"". therefore, it is very hard at first to accept that trying to do something DECENTLY will actually achieve superior results than trying to do something PERFECTLY. additionally, you may feel that you are ""settling for less"" if you don't demand perfection from yourself. do not be disturbed by these initial difficulties
&gt;
&gt;i view perfectionism as ignoring the 90% of the task you did great, and focusing only on the 10% you messed up on- this is a sure way to kill motivation!
&gt;
&gt;if this article has achieved it's intended purpose, you now see perfectionism for what it is: the antidote to real achievement. you may also have a desire to change your ""all or nothing"" thinking- if so, begin immediately. do not worry that you aren't ""ready""- procrastination stems from perfectionism, as the fear of not doing something PERFECTLY causes it to be put off indefinitely. instead, decide now to make a DECENT attempt- at first, try to simply become aware of 'ALL or NOTHING' thoughts when you encounter them. simply by becoming aware of them, you will destroy most of their power.

Since the start of school this semester (my ""sophomore and a half"" year, after a terrible freshman year), I've been doing incredibly about getting and staying disciplined. We're talking leaps and bounds past where I've been before. Barely missing a single class session, getting all my homework done, studying for tests. I started hitting the gym again and logging my calories so I can lose weight and finally become cut. I stopped playing constructed M:tG so I could have money. Which is excellent, except for one thing.

Sometimes, you just want to relax. Sometimes, it should be ok to give in a bit when you've been good about discipline to avoid burnout. The problem is, all of my resources are tied up!



**Time:** I can't get much more lax than I am right now. With studying physics and calculus and both being fairly new to me and fairly important for the rest of my life (as an engineering major), I need to get these done, always. 



**Money:** I don't make much as is. I occasionally reward myself with little things, and I can't afford much beyond that. 



**Calories:** I can rarely do a cheat meal, mostly because my money's tied up, and the kinds of meals I WANT to eat are enormous and would set me back a lot.

Few months later in October I got a full time job in the backstore of a major retailer, and fastforward to today and I am still working that job. I absolutely do not regret taking this time off as I've grown a lot and learned a lot. My current plan is to keep saving money s othat in march/april I can go to Japan for 2 weeks, and then start back CEGEP in august 2014.

Now to this post, I think I may have too many goals, but at the same time I am not exactly sure since I can *kind of* manage it. Let me explain a bit more in detail.

**Goals I am currently working on**

* Be in bed at 1 and get up at 8:30

To explain this one a little bit, I work 3-11pm and get home at midnight. I've been doing this for a month, and have had no problems getting uop at 8:30; have only slipped up once. The problem lies in going to bed at 1. When I get back from work at midnight I have to unwind a little bit before I can sleep, but usually that ends up in me browsing reddit/youtube for too long. I am getting better though, I often get to bed at 1:30 instead of 2-3.

* Learn Japanese

Well I don't really need to explain this too much. I've started learning japanese 2 months ago after wanting to learn the language for a while and I'm going to visit there next march/april and plan to go study there as part of a study abroad program for university. All I can say here is that the amount I do everyday isn't calculated in time but in how much I do, so some days it'll be 1 hours, other days I'll have more to do so 2 hours (I use a Spaced Repetition System software called ""Anki"").

Also another part of how I'm learning japanese is immersion. A good way to speed up the progress of learning, and to have more fun, is to immerse myself with japanese things. The more the better, but I obviously don't have the opportunity to immerse myself all that much. That being said, I do enjoy watching anime and reading manga, especially if it helps my japanese!

* Making Let's Plays

Now this might seem like a weird thing to put on here, but hear me out. Yes I'm a gamer. Yes this is, in a way, an excuse to not drop gaming. But this is a good thing! How? Well first, making Let's Plays helps me with my spoken english. As I've said, my native language isn't english. I've had a lot of written practice, and while I am nowhere near perfect, I can easily hold conversations with native english speakers. On the other hand, I've barely had any spoken practice, so I have trouble with it. By doing let's plays, I hope to create a need for me to speak english, and thus get more practice in, and get better at it. Effortlessly, too, because I will be doing this by playing games. Another thing, too, is that I'm a pretty reserved guy who is often affraid to say what comes to my mind. By doing let's plays, I will have to get used to say what comes to my mind, because that's the only way I will manage to maintain an entertaining commentary. So by playing videos games, I am hoping to help my english skills, and also my overall speaking skills.

* Guitar

Now this one is a bit vague, I agree. I've playd (electric) guitar for a few years now - in one month it will have been 6 years since I started (Or is it 7? I'm not sure). I love playing guitar, and it is something I never want to stop doing. I try to play at least 3 songs everyday to make sure my skills don't regress, but most of the time I play more than that and thus I get better. I also make guitar covers on youtube for two reasons. The first one is just to show my friends and family what I am learning and playing and that I actually AM still playing. The second and biggest reason is so that I can look back and see the progress I've done. I remember when I made those videos I did a few years back; I thought they were the shit! But now I think they are shit! :p 


**Goals I have yet to start working on, due to procrastinating, not lack of time**

* Lose weight / get in shape

Now this maybe I should've put in the goals I'm working on but really I'm not. When I started working, I weighted 240 lbs. Now, I weight 210 lbs. Sounds like progress right? It is, but I've stopped loosing weight months ago and have stayed stable here. It is time for me to do more exercise outside of work and slowly change my diet to something a bit more healthy. Which leads me to my next goal...

* Stop buying junk food at work, and only buy food when I didn't have enough food at home to make a proper dinner.

Like I said, I work in retail. Which means it's very easy to just go buy some food during my break. Most of the time I buy unhealthy food, which is, well, unhealthy. So I want to try to stop that. As for the second part, sometimes I will go and buy.. let's say, a salad. But because of it, I end up not eating all the food I brought for dinner. Sure the salad was healthy, but so was my dinner, and now I have wasted money to buy food when I didn't need to buy food. If I had eaten all my dinner instead, that money saved would've been able to go towards my trip to japan + my studies. 5 bucks might not seem like a lot on the spot; but it adds up!


**CONCLUSION**

Now back to my question; do you think I have too many goals? I definitely have enough time to do these things, except on the rare days that I hang out with friends, but on these days I go with elimination process: what is more important to me, and what is gonna be repercuted (is this even a word?) the most if I skip a day? Usually the answer is Japanese; that is always my #1 focus. After that, it's a total blur and everything seems to be on the same level of important-ness. My problem is that even if I have the time to do all of this, I often end up lacking the motivation / discipline to do this. And also, when I get back to school, how will I manage to go to school, do my homework/studying, work, commute, and work on all of these goals? I feel like my question is very weird and not clear, but I'm hoping that from the few people who will probably read the whole thing, someone will be able to either pinpoint what my question really is, or be able to ask a question that will make me realise what my real question is (not that this isn't a real question, but I feel like I'm missing the point by just a tiny hair).

Well either way, thanks to everyone and I'm sooo sorry for the huge post :s so much longer than I expected.

I'm just a few days from breaking my previous record of 47 days. But in the mean time, I really want to kick my discipline level up another notch.  

I have noticed while doing work that I get distracted easily and within seconds find myself burning a lot of my productivity away surfing reddit, facebook, or some other website that piques my interest. I'm starting to think this is more so a product of an internet addiction and dopamine receptors doing what they do with nofap albeit on a different level rather than laziness. I've also noticed that that when I go on extended trips as short as 3 days away from home with zero access to the computer, I return feeling refreshed and not feeling any need to access my computer at all.

Hey,

I want to discipline myself and be able to fit 90 minutes of study into my routine. Now I wake up at 5am and have to leave at 650am for uni. 10 minutes for breakfast (I never skip my oats) and 10 minutes to dress and get ready. That leaves enough time for some nice study to get done. I usually sleep at around 10-11pm and am refreshed at 5 am. I am doing a science-based degree and my subjects include psychology, chemistry and biology. 

Only problem is; I can't bring myself to do it.

If try to start, I just end up opening my laptop and going on reddit or something else. 

Some main things I need:

- to be able to keep myself awake at that time
- to psych myself up in order to be able to study 
- to be punctual and not slack off


Some questions:

a) should i start off small e.g. 30 minutes of study or should i try to implement the larger 90 minutes of study?

b) should i use the pomodoro technique and try to do three sets of 25 minutes study + 5 minute break?

c) What type of study should this be; revising notes, doing flash cards, doing problem sets, doing calculation questions?


p.s. I thought of posting this to getstudying, but i figured it was more of a discipline issue than an actual studying one.

Can anyone please help me with a step by step method outline of how i can  break this barrier and start this schedule?

Any advice would be great; big or small. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1dq2uq,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1dq2uq/help_me_study_in_the_morning/,

Actually new to reddit in particular.  Decided that if I'm going to use Reddit to stay up late browsing porn and r/funny, I might as well be productive.  Here's where I'm at.

I used to smoke cigs for about a year when things looked so bland and dark that playing with death for the sake of ""looking cool"" seemed like a good idea.  When i quit that lifestyle (hard labour, minimum wage) for another go at college, I decided that it was best to quit smoking too.  One of the best decisions of my life.  Lost my virginity to a girl who thought it was ""cool"" that I had the discipline to quit.  I feel better because of it; I don't have a drug that darkens me that I depend on, and my wallet is a bit heavier.  I still have cravings and the realism of the risk of going back to it is very real to me, so I will probably be cautious of the temptation for the rest of my life.  I have the motivation, and I have the discipline, I just don't have the methodology.

I am going to a community college right now full time (about 17 units this semester), and working part-time as a tutor.

I'm going insane from the homework.  I have to be up at 0600 and ready to go by 7:15 to be there at 7:45 to start school at 8.  On a good day i'm there till 3 and get home at 3:45, so I put in a 7-9 hour shift in just for school. I'm cool with this.  

My problem is that, by the time I arrive safely at my house, I'm generally too tired to do homework effectively, which means it piles and piles until it comes to the weekend, where I work two more 10+ hour days to keep up with it (I'm horrible with math and my two monsters are ""Finite Math (business calculus, i guess?) and ""Intro to Accounting""

Anybody graduate from college who has any tips on dealing with the massive amounts of homework that can help me?  Ideally, I'd like to free-up at least part of the week-end so I can pretend to have a social life. Thanks.

One more thing, I was home-schooled my entire young life and never had ""home-work"" because everything was homework, so even the basics will be helpful.

Basically go 30 days without hitting the snooze button once, and still getting up on time obviously. Yesterday night I was feeling quite tired around 12:00, I read till about 12:30 and was sleeping quite fast after. 

My math alarm woke me up at 7:30 (the standard time I set for the challenge), the problem it posed was a little to eazy and I finished it in no time. And then I almost went back to sleep, the one thing holding me back was that I would have to post an embarrassing message today and I was going to have none of that. 

So through what I perceived as an herculean effort I got myself out of bed and into the shower. It was only when my shower suddenly turned cold I really woke up.

I think my alarm woke me when I was in the middle of a so called deep sleep cycle and it made it therefore harder to get up on time. 
Tonight I'm turning in earlier so that my natural waking up time is more in tune with my alarm.

Some commenter have suggested, the app sleep time or sleep cycle, I will give these apps a try. And post my experiences.

For everyone having trouble with sleeping on time: read a book! I've been trying it only for two days but I really think a smartphone keeps you awake. Research suggests that the backlighting of the screen stop the production of melatonin, our sleep hormone.

I've been loving this sub-reddit a lot, and have been consciously working on ways to improve myself for over a year now - and really enjoyed it all. But one thing that has been holding me back is fear.

For example, at my job I have a few projects I am having trouble with. Not ""end of the world"" trouble, but everyday issues that I just need to solve. But instead of wading into the muck, I procrastinate and work on other things (which are still important, but not causing problems). Then after a bit, the issues just become bigger and bigger until I can't ignore them, and have to either cut my losses and cancel the project, or kick it up to my boss.

When I really think about it, I'm procrastinating because I fear that addressing a problem makes it real - while if I ignore it, I can have another happy day or two before the shit hits the fan. I'm not afraid of working hard, I'm more afraid of other people recognizing my mistake and thinking I'm completely incompetent in all areas.

So, any advice on how you work through your fear of addressing a problem? I'm sure I'm not alone on this issue (at least I hope not), and any sage advice would help me out a ton!

These goals aren't big, for instance today I said I would complete a group essay (all sections there) and do a job application. I set 2 hours to do the final two sections of the essay, it took me 3 and a half to do 75% of what I wanted. After two hours the job application is in its final stages, but my mind is cluttered and getting it to the standard I want is becoming difficult.

We need discipline if we are going to put in the consistent and dedicated work required to achieve our goals.  I used to associate the idea of discipline with strict timetables, willpower and the idea of powering through a task.  However, I eventually found, that for me, this was unsustainable.

The problem is that if you have a remotely busy life then you can expect to have any number of random events happen which can throw you off schedule.  At points I have had to study late at college, do a project, meet up with friends or go to job interviews, all at irregular or unexpected hours.  The problem I experienced was that I had tied my discipline in with various parameters such as the time of day or location, and due to these events these parameters had changed.  I would have a notion of a “morning run”, or reading before bed, but then when these were no longer possible for some reason I would give up on the habit, “fall off the wagon” and completely regress.

Your life isn’t static, and you wouldn’t want it to be either!  But to avoid completely regressing you need to stay flexible and think laterally the interfering situation while keeping sight of your goal.  If you can’t go to the gym at the time you normally do, don’t miss it – go at a different time or find a different way to exercise to the level you need to.  If you normally go for a run but your knees or ankles are beginning to ache from the impact, then switch to something like swimming.

The key here is thinking practically and making the best of a situation rather than expecting things to go perfectly and falling apart when they don’t.

**TL;DR:  Sooner or later life is going to throw a sucker punch at your schedule.  You need to bob and weave, and sidestep your way to a position you can keep fighting from.**

1. Share how we are getting disciplined.

2. Ask for advice on getting disciplined.

**Outline**

- Goal.  What is the end product of the discipline you are aiming to achieve?

- Plan.  To know if you are being disciplined you need a daily plan, what is it?

- Execution.  What things can you do to help you carry out your plan daily? 

---------

**RPM Method**

Need to add how you will measure your results and also measure how well you are carrying out your plan.

For example if you a learning a skill, the measurement will be 'How many minutes/hours have you spent on practicing this week?'

For weight loss you can measure your weight (measuring the result) but you can also measure your exercise and diet (energy expenditure and energy intake).


**Result**

- What result do you want?  Be as specific as possible.

**Plan**

- What is your daily/weekly plan for getting this result?

Losing weight: do exercise X 30 minutes every day, take in X calories per day

Study: 1 hour self study on weekdays, 2 hours group study on saturday

- Do you have a plan that someone else has followed and obtained the result you want?

Losing weight: couch to 5k, other plans in /r/fitness

Study: one mentioned above or something in /r/getstudying

**Motivators**

- Extrinsic motivators: Why do you want this result?

Losing weight: increased confidence, increased health, attract mates, positive attention, increased stamina.

Study: increased knowledge, increased career prospects, increase scholarship chances.

- Intrinsic motivators: What do you enjoy about the task itself?

For losing weight, this would be enjoying the particular physical activity you enjoy to expend your energy.  i.e. you enjoy swimming so you spend your energy this way.

For study, this would be finding a pleasant study environment, enjoying the reading, enjoying thinking through problems and content you are study.  The process of writing out notes by hand, or maybe even enjoying group study with classmates.

**Measurement**

- How will you measure your result?

For losing weight this would be measuring your weight and tracking it.
For study this would be your exam mark.

- How will you measure your performance?

For losing weight this would be measuring your caloric intake and expenditure through exercise.

For study this would be the number of hours you have studied this week.

1375953236.0,16,self.getdisciplined,1jy2bb,Alternative vs. traditional aspirations while dealing with procrastination.,gpc,18,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1jy2bb/alternative_vs_traditional_aspirations_while/,"I'm in need of some advice. 

(There's a fairly concise TL;DR at the bottom, for the lazy).

I'm a 26 year old dude. I've been composing music and playing instruments since I was like 6, and I've always envisioned myself as a hard working, passionate artist who will commit to his art (for the sake of art itself) till the day I die. But at the same time, If I'm honest with myself, this is clearly not what my actions are showing.

I live with my mom, and I've always had great support from both of my parents in every crazy enterprise I dwell in. Over the years, I've been developing a discourse for them (and myself), in which I express intending to risk my financial future in the sake of concentrating all of my efforts in creating great music. My rationalization comes from being in such a comfortable and rare position in life right now, one in which I don't need to work to survive (thanks to my parents); plus the fact that I perceive myself (others as well) as being exceptionally talented. This mix generates in me a sense of duty, and I like it.

But there's a problem. The truth is, I have to think about money, cause my parents won't be here forever. And one way I've been able to psychologically deal with that, is by envisioning big financial rewards coming from my music, in the future. But I think this has been a mistake, cause now the act of composing carries a big load: my financial independence. This has generated lots of anxiety over the years, and in consequence, serious procrastination.

When I finished high school I thought about pursuing an academic career in music, but I decided that I should go for something a bit more suitable for making money; so I could sustain my music endeavors in the future, if necessary. I spent three years in and out of college till I decided that I will be better off working full time on my rock band at the time. My parents expressed their concern, but they supported my decision. After about six months of waking every morning at 2:00 o' clock and spending every afternoon drinking beer with my band mates in the studio, I accepted the truth: I was making music, and it was good; but I wasn't spending ALL of my time and effort in doing it; not even nearly. So I went back to college and graduated last December.

During college, I was able to get some freelance jobs as a musician (writing jingles and stuff), and it was cool, but it wasn't enough to make a living; so I stuck to my plan.

I've been working on a music project for about 3 and a half years now, and I'm not even close to finishing it. I just don't have the discipline, and it stresses me out as f**k. It makes me really sad, because I love making music, but I'm freaking addicted to this procrastination crap. So I'm beginning to think that risking my financial future for it might be worthless, because I'm not getting it done.

Last week, I was offered a full time job, with a nice office and nice people. I have the capacity to do this job, but the schedule is a nightmare. I would be working from 9 to 9 or even 10 o' clock at night. I accepted, but I yet have to talk to some people to make it official.

I'm profoundly worried about not having enough time to make my music, but it infuriates me to know that I don't even work on it when I have all the time in the world.

I know I will be able to be fairly disciplined at this job, thanks to the authority figures and social pressure; but I wish I could spend that effort in doing my thing.

I've been telling myself that this is not a death sentence. That I could quit whenever I want, plus it'll be good to train my brain with some forced discipline, so maybe I'll get cured of my procrastination issues thanks to this job. Maybe?

What scares me is that I might get to comfortable in the job, and with the money and all that I might lack the strength to quit and eventually become a 55 year office man with a wife and two kids and a broken dream.

Should I try it out, or should I keep trying to fix my procrastination issues by myself and go for the crazy, risky, artist life I've always dreamed of?

TL;DR: I want to spend my life making music in purely artistic terms, and I'm willing to risk my financial future in this pursuit; but I'm addicted to procrastination, so taking the risk seems futile. I was recently offered a position in a fairly traditional full-time job. Should I take it and keep making music as a hobby; or should I keep fighting my addiction and pursue the artistic life?

The first time I can remember taking ""happy pills,"" as I jokingly called antidepressants back then, was when I was in third grade. I was 7. 

This illness has been with me for so long that over the years I stopped thinking of it as ""depression."" It was simply life. For as far back as I could recall, a profound, inexplicable sadness had been my more or less constant companion, even as I appeared on the outside to be living a reasonably decent life. It seeped into every corner of my existence, preventing me from feeling true joy no matter how content I seemed, to others and to myself, on the surface. I could not experience the apparent happiness of the people who surrounded me and loved me, though I wanted to desperately. I began to suspect that happiness was genetic, like a good singing voice, or a beautiful pair of eyes. You either have it or you don't, and there's nothing to be done for those of us who fall into the former category. 

I found comfort in food and in other sensory pleasures. Drugs appealed to me naturally. I abused anything that could help lift me temporarily out of the agonizing dullness of my existence, that would silence the hateful thoughts for a few blessed hours. At 13 I became bulimic. At 16 I discovered weed, and a new addiction was born. 

I have never treated myself well. I abused my body and mind, and made reckless choices that I knew would hurt me, and did. Deep down, I despised the person I was, and saw no reason why I should be kind to him. He could die, for all I cared. 

And I thought I would, sooner rather than later. I could not imagine myself living past thirty. I'd be long dead by then, I figured, and in all likelihood by my own hand.

When I was 17, I finally gave in to my parents' pleas and allowed them to schedule an appointment for me with a psychotherapist. His specialty was in children and adolescents, and I had seen him for a couple years when I was a pre-teen, but I had never been all that committed to it, and thus the therapy proved mostly ineffectual. I went in this time fully expecting it to be the same. 

Except something was different. I had matured emotionally, and was more willing to communicate, as a (near) adult talking to another adult. After the ice had broken, I found myself opening up to this man, one of the kindest men I've ever known, and out spilled, like water breaking through a dam, years of pent up anguish. It was then that I realized how desperate I was for a cure. With my therapist's help, I began the long process of understanding, and flushing out, my demons. This in part meant consenting with his request that I give antidepressants another try, a decision that troubled me at first but one that I am now intensely glad I made.  

It's been three years since then, and the work hasn't been easy. In fact, it's been damn hard, and I have only recently begun to enjoy the fruits of my labor. But oh how sweet they are. 

Around a year ago I had a stunning revelation: I did not hate myself anymore. In fact, I was beginning to quite like the person I was becoming. I felt happy to be alive for the first time in my life. The clouds hanging like a tumor over my horizon parted, and the future suddenly seemed a warm, welcoming place, full of wonderful things I had never before dreamed could be mine. 

My progress in therapy had illuminated for me the path to lasting happiness; a path paved by hard work and simple, passionate living, and maintained by unconditional love for yourself and for those people who bring joy into your life, whomever they may be.

I now rejoice in discipline. I have beaten bulimia, and can safely say that the urge to binge and purge is long behind me. I exercise five times a week. I read vigorously, and take my studies very seriously. I recently quit smoking marijuana, and am confident in my ability to abstain from using it in the future. I am making an active effort to develop more meaningful relationships with the people around me. I am even beginning to fall in love with someone, a sensation more powerful than anything I have ever felt. It is a little terrifying, to be honest, but in a good way.

I am careful not to be swept away by austerity. I reward myself when I feel I deserve to be rewarded. I never let a workout routine or a diet get in the way of my enjoyment of life. Spontaneity is your friend. If an old buddy from high school calls me up, you better believe my plans will take a backseat to catching up with him. After all, what is the good of hard work if its benefits cannot be enjoyed while in the pursuit of leisure? 

It is good to be proud. It is good to be in love with yourself. There is no shame in love. Never forget that. 

Having broken free from the chains of depression, I feel confident in saying that there is nothing quite like discovering happiness after a lifetime of 
sadness. It is a glorious feeling. I wish it upon all the unhappy people in the world. ",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1huv8c,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1huv8c/its_like_escaping_a_nightmare_and_finding/,

I enjoy using techniques like the Pomodoro (look it up if you don't know it) and the NOW Habit (basically adds structure to the Pomodoro thing), but I find that the best way to challenge myself is to keep trying new techniques.  I'm always experimenting with ways to improve my discipline--as someone said on this subreddit, it's a muscle, and it needs to be exercised.  

I was playing a video game the other day and I thought that it'd be awesome if life worked like an RPG; every time you completed some repetitive action, you'd move closer towards ""leveling up,"" and you'd be immediately rewarded upon leveling.   

So I decided to design something like that for myself.  I've written out my game below, and I added a few headers since it's a huge wall of text.

**Assigning Value to Everyday Tasks**

I opened up a spreadsheet and, in one column, wrote out a list of positive daily actions that could improve me as a person.  I assigned each task a value in experience points, with 10 being the max.  

For example, ""Take Out Trash"" is worth 2 experience points.  ""Work for an hour"" is worth 10 points (I'm a freelance writer, and getting motivated to work has been a problem for me at times).

In another column, I made ""Quests.""  These are high-experience tasks that might take a while to do.  Patching up a hole in my drywall is worth 25 points, for instance.  Some of the stuff is huge; if I pay off all of my debt, it's worth 700 points.  Obviously, some of these point values are arbitrary.


**Leveling Up**


I needed to earn 100 points in a single day to get to Level 2, 110 points to get to level 3, and so on.  The game gets progressively harder, and I need to take more positive actions and complete more positive goals to get to that next level.  However, I'm also becoming more organized, more in shape, and more productive every day, so while I might not level as frequently, it's never out of reach.

I can level up more than once per day, but if I'm between levels when the day ends--for instance, I've got 50 points towards a level, but I need 110--it gets wiped back to nothing for the next day.

**Reward System**

The important part is the instant gratification.  It's the way we're wired, unfortunately, so it's part of my game.  Every time I level up, I take $20 from my bank account and spend it in a fun or creative way.  If you're on a tight budget, you might treat yourself to a few hours of some activity that you enjoy.  

Anyways, if you like video games or board games, you might give this a shot.  It's really worked for me, probably because it uses a simple reward system to make tasks more attractive.  

I've also added other stuff to make it a little more complex.  For instance, I've got perks for certain tasks; I get 2 points if I clean the dishes, but 5 points if the sink is completely empty throughout the day.  I get 5 points for finishing a book, but 10 points if it's nonfiction or a classic.

EDIT: Here's a link to my spreadsheet.  It's pretty basic, but if you're looking for an easy format for getting started, hereyago.  I log my daily points on a piece of paper--I just think it's easier to use paper for certain things.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AsNBc4oWVwLmdFJNblFIS3lnNU9QX0NaYmNFOVYzVGc&amp;output=html

Over thousands of years, this stream will carve its way down through layers of mud and rock, creating a canyon (if the conditions are right). 

Every new habit that we engage in is initially a thin stream, with little force behind it. The more we engage in this set pattern of behavior, the further the little stream carves its way down through the layers of our psyche, becoming a deeply embedded neural pathway that we follow with little hesitation. 

When we try and change our habits, the degree of difficulty will vary depending on how deep of a canyon that little stream has managed to carve. I see a lot of people on here dumfounded at how they can keep failing at changing themselves and their habits, wondering what they are doing wrong. They don't realize how deeply engrained their habits are within them. They don't realize that, in order to change, they are going to have to climb out of a canyon.

Phase 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, it leads to diffused efforts.

So if you want to become a champion, just message me your impossible and how much you want to commit to raising for Full Circle. If you don't want to commit to raising any money, that's fine! Just say what your impossible is and just start working towards it today!

Tucker-Ladd,ThereIsNoJustice,18,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/11c1v1/psychological_selfhelp_by_dr_clayton_e_tuckerladd/,"http://www.psychologicalselfhelp.org/ (A free, online book, also downloadable as a pdf.)

You will likely want to read chapters 4, 5, 11-14. This might seem like heavy reading for some people, almost like a textbook. Would anyone like to do weekly discussions on the chapters relating to motivation/discipline? (Or post what helped you in this thread) 

This preview will give you some idea of what to expect:
&gt;Motivation is trying to reach our goals. But, it isn't just a matter of setting high, noble goals, as discussed in chapter 3, although that is a critical step. It is common to wish for higher goals than we are willing to do the work to attain. We want to be a lawyer but goof off in high school. Many college students with a 2.7 GPA want to become PhD’s. We want to be a star performer but don't like to practice. Even when trying to better ourselves we may lack the motivation. For example, Rosen (1982) found that only half of the people in a self-help program completed the work. Those who stuck with it got good results (overcoming their fears). Similar results have been found in toilet training of children and self-administered treatment for premature ejaculation. Likewise, Schindler (1979) reported that only 17 of 60 subjects made full use of an assertiveness book. What determines these vast differences in motivation among us? Why are some of us fantastic achievers while others take the easy route? We don't know for sure (but see learned industriousness later), but having explicit goals and certain attitudes help.

&gt;Life goals set our sails and give us a push, e.g. ""I want to help people."" People who reach many or most of their life goals are usually calmer, happier, healthier and less stressed or emotional. However, there seem to be certain life goals that harm our mental health, e.g. ""I want to have the power to control or impress people."" Wanting to be close to and good to others is associated with better emotional health (National Advisory Mental Health Council, 1995). Likewise, seeking to improve your skills (""mastery goals"") results in feeling good about trying hard and in increased effort when an obstacle is met. But wanting to beat others (""performance goals""), such as having a winning season in football or being the best student in your math class, result in avoiding tough challenges, giving up when starting to lose, feeling more anxious, and less gain in self-esteem than with mastery goals. This is why enlightened coaches are teaching players to focus on mastering their basic skills, not on their won-loss record. It is also easy to see the connection between mastery vs. performance goals and intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation or satisfaction. The importance of intrinsic satisfaction and the problems with extrinsic rewards are discussed thoroughly later under ""Why behavior is hard to understand.""

&gt;In any area where we are hoping to self-improve, both short-term and long-range goals are needed. If your long-term goals clearly contribute to your most important values and your philosophy of life, they should be more motivating. Good goals are fairly hard--they stretch us--but they are achievable taking small steps at a time. As much as possible, you should explicitly describe your goals in terms of very specific behaviors. Danish, Petitpas &amp; Hale (1995) provide examples of specific behaviors in sports psychology:

&gt;Physical skills--""I'll do 3 more sit ups and 3 more push ups this week than I did last week."" Cognitive skills--""I'll develop some self-talk that should reduce my fears and improve my batting."" · Gain knowledge--""I'll learn more about exercising to prevent my back from hurting."" · Courage--""I'll practice batting against a very fast pitcher for two weeks, then I'll try out for the school team."" · Social support--""I'll talk to the coach about batting; I'll make friends with guys/girls on the team.""

&gt;Positive objectives are usually more motivating than negative ones, e.g. ""I want to bat over .300"" is a better goal than ""I'd like to be less scared of the ball."" Certainly, the more appealing goals are something you want, not something imposed on you. Mastery-oriented people, realizing success depends on their skills, become more selfdirected, work harder, achieve a higher level of performance, and get more enjoyment out of the activity. In contrast, according to Murphy (1995), ""performance""-oriented people are more likely to strive for attention and view beating others as a ""life or death"" matter (in this case, failure is interpreted as ""I don't have the ability"" and interest declines).

&gt;Challenging-but-achievable goals are themselves motivating. On the other hand, easy-to-reach goals are boring and/or demeaning. Impossible goals are frustrating (and there are lots of impossible goals, in contrast with the ""if you can dream it, you can achieve it"" nonsense). Since challenging but realistic goals require us to stretch and grow, they must constantly be changed to match the conditions and our ability. We are most motivated when we feel capable, responsible, self-directed, respected, and hopeful.

&gt;As discussed in attribution theory later, a highly motivated achiever may utilize complex optimistic or pessimistic cognitive strategies (Cantor, 1990). For example, an optimistic, high achieving student may seek out friends who value and reinforce his/her successes in school, he/she frequently re-lives in fantasy his/her past accomplishments and dreams of the future, and he/she may relax with friends before an exam. This is called ""illusory glow"" optimism because such a person nurtures and protects his/her selfesteem and confidence. They expect to do very well, they work very hard, they enjoy their successes, and, if they should fail, they automatically and immediately apply an ""I couldn't help it"" defense of the ego (and optimistically take on the next challenge).

&gt;On the other hand, Cantor describes the high achieving ""defensive pessimist"" as defending his/her self-esteem before the test, not afterwards. Such a student expects to do poorly or, at least, anticipates a variety of possible stumbling blocks. He/she works very hard, preparing especially well for the anticipated difficulties. He/she uses the high test anxiety and stress as motivators, not as something to avoid, and then takes an ""I expected it"" attitude towards the rare failure that does occur (and with anxious excitement systematically attacks the next challenge). This strategy is very different from the pessimistic student who ""bad mouths"" him/herself after a failure: ""I'm such an idiot,"" ""I'm so lazy,"" etc. Such a pessimist is likely to gradually lower his/her expectations and goals, and perform more and more poorly until eventually becoming a total pessimist who has no hope, expects to fail and, therefore, doesn't try.",,False,,t5_2uzju,1349998548.0,,,True,t3_11c1v1,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/11c1v1/psychological_selfhelp_by_dr_clayton_e_tuckerladd/,

This is my dilemma. I am currently a student who's failing terribly, and my exams just in a months time. This is really do or die. The thing is I'm not disciplined enough to study, (hence I'm failing). I'm writing this to affirm my thoughts and from tomorrow onwards I will begin on this quest. Please support me. 

Let me begin with a quote, my mantra. ""The starting point of all achievement is desire. Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small amount of fire makes a small amount of heat."" - Napoleon Hill. 

Dear future me, 
  I hope you look back on the present me not with sad tired eyes. Not of disdain, of pity. Not of despair, but of inspiration. Not of regret, but of contentment. But I am scared, I am in the midst of a turning point in my life. If I screw this up, so help me god. But all those are just wishes, petty aspirations. 
  
  The future me, I can give you nothing, but I have everything to gift. Nothing real Ivan give you. However i will promise you one thing, to never, never ever stop being hungry. 

  Somewhere along the weathered road, I think i lost sight of you, of us. And I hope you do not hate me for it. For us I will succeed. But how? 

  That is why, the only thing I have to offer, to give,  is to always stay hungry. To desire. That flame that burns, to feed it, never let it die. Once it dies, we are dead.

  But with every action, there must come a plan. The future looks so hazy that I dare not even plan more than the next month before the a's. This is my plan. Study. Study. Sleep, eat. Study. Never Stop, never be distracted. You are your biggest enemy. Funny how that is,  seeing how i am really your biggest enemy. 

  I will succeed. There is no 2 ways about it. Do or do. Never surrender, you will falter, but try not to stay down too long, it will never get to us again. Your will be triumphant, prove to the naysayers, to the haters. To me, to you.

[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/10jkkd/my_thoughts_on_the_economics_of_discipline_long/)

Part 2: Willpower, attention, discomfort, and discipline

So let’s say you wake up one morning and you have no energy and no motivation.  Ack!  This means all of your buyers decided to stay indoors today, or maybe you haven’t given them enough time to SLEEP.

But what if you have a job interview or a test right now!  These huge businesses are in town today, but if there’s no customers they will close shop and never come back.  

That’s when you call in the emergency team – these are your police or firefighter departments.  Yes, you’re going to have to send the POLICE after your buyers and drag them out of bed to the marketplace.  

What do the police and firefighters represent? Your attention.  Well, part of it, anyway.  You also have construction workers and bridge builders and doctors and mailmen, all under your employ.  Everyday you send various government workers to various places – help repair the vehicles and keep them maintained, or help set up the marketplace so that the businesses can start doing business in the morning.  

So on that important test or interview day when you have no energy (buyers), that’s when you send your police, because there’s no other choice.  

Of course, your buyers aren’t going to be happy.  “Well now you’re just forcing me to buy shit.” They’ll complain, but all you can do is say “sorry, I know you want to stay home and sleep, but if we want to keep the economy alive, you’re gonna HAVE to come out.”  

So how do you have enough money to pay these policemen?  

You’re going to need *money*.  And that’s what willpower represents - willpower is the amount of money your government has to spend on the various sectors of the economy.  The more willpower you have, the better you are able to direct your attention towards the areas that need improvement the most.

The only problem is you only have a limited supply of willpower.  Willpower is different than energy and motivation (your buyers).  Willpower does not regenerate every day.  In fact, you might go weeks without regenerating willpower – recall a time in your life when you could not change ANYTHING about it, every day was the same and very little improvements were made.

Without willpower, your policemen and construction workers will all lose their jobs.  And then, when you have that sudden job interview or finals exam, you won’t have that emergency task force waiting at the ready to bring your buyers to the market.

So now you’re asking, “if willpower doesn’t regenerate, and I’ve depleted all my factories of willpower, how do I get more?”  

That’s what brings us to the most difficult part of this entire equation:

Taxes.  

You’re going have to tax the hell out of the participants in your economy if you want to maintain your bank of willpower.

But the key is to tax smartly, not with a blunt axe.  What should the government tax – indulging in a 3-hour session of video gaming, or a 3-hour session of hardcore studying?  Obviously, the former.  You want LESS of those transactions happening, and more of the latter (subsidize that shit).

No one likes taxes.  When you tax something, no one’s going to be happy – your buyers aren’t going to be happy and neither are your sellers.  But you have to do it, or else your economy’s going to get out of control  - you’ll sink into laziness and small pleasures as your toxic businesses start doing well, and you’ll lose all your willpower.  

But how exactly *do* you tax those not-so-good transactions and vendors who are damaging your economy?  

The answer is discomfort.

Yep, taxes suck.  And so does discomfort.  Everyone wants to be comfortable.

But realize this: without discomfort, you will never achieve your dreams.  If you are comfortable with your situation in life, comfortable with your habits and comfortable with your goals, you will never feel that sense of incongruency that “pushes” you into reaching for more.

The more uncomfortable you are, the more willpower you’ll get, that’s called taxation.  So when you’re enjoying those activities of pleasure, you can choose – do you tax it a lot, or do you tax it only a little?  

I say, tax it a lot.  Feel bad that you’re indulging in something when you should be out working on your dreams.  Everyone needs a break once in a while – but don’t let your break get off scot-free without adding to your own funds of willpower.

And so by feeling uncomfortable, even *bad*, about those toxic transactions, you’re going to add to your own willpower.  Think of all the times when you indulged like crazy, and then the next day you thought “shit, today I HAVE to get something done.”

At the same time, don’t feel TOO good about your good transactions.  Yes, your 3 hours of studying was great, but don’t feel too comfortable – you still have a lot more to do.  Every time you feel comfortable about your life, your willpower will not increase, and will get depleted quickly.  

So maintain your levels of willpower (money) by constantly feeling discomfort about your current situation.  That way, you’ll have the money to invest in the infrastructure and vehicles that allow your buyers to reach your sellers in more efficient ways.  That way, you’ll have the money to pay your policemen and firefighters so that if an emergency situation comes up, they’ll be well-able to deal with it.  

Of course, never tax too much.  Too much discomfort is also bad.  When you have too much money in your coffers and you’re not spending it correctly – your country will get mad.  They will revolt.  They will ask, “why are we being taxed so hard, when we’re getting so little benefits from this idiot government?”  

That’s when you have all kinds of these fucked up situations like depression, where you have no buyers willing to come out, or zero confidence in your own self, where you have no businesses willing to open shop.  If you’re TOO uncomfortable with yourself, you might just end up destroying everything.  

So, let’s not even go there.

for example: if you want to start exercising, grab a notebook, and write, 'I want to start exercising'. Then, come up with some kind of realistic plan for yourself, maybe three times throughout the week you know you have free time where you could exercise. Write down, 'I will exercise at x,y,z'. Then, when the time comes, do the exercise, and go back to your notebook and write, 'I exercised @x,y,z'. And there it is, you've accomplished what you set out to do. This can apply to anything, quitting an addiction, 'I never want to (insert addiction) again'. Then, every day when you wake up, 'I will not (addiction) today.' End of a successful day, 'I did not (addiction) today'. It helps you to get your real desires from thought form into physical form by writing them down, and it helps to have a concrete plan on how you're going to go about realizing those desires, and then it really helps to document your success once you've accomplished it - you can't write about your successes unless you achieved them (unless you're going to lie to yourself), so looking forward to documenting your success can be great motivation to actually achieve it. It's amazing what you can accomplish with a notebook that costs you a dollar, or even a piece of paper or a napkin or your bathroom mirror, anywhere you can write something. Small disclaimer, this isn't going to work if you're not entirely committed to being consistent, but then again, neither is anything else, but commitment and consistency is another discussion.

I have a few questions for the individuals whom are currently pursuing their education online:

- What is your timetable? How many hours do you study per day and at what times. Personally I work 8am - 4:30pm therefore I presume night time will be the optimal time for study hours. 

- Teaching myself. Any tips to make self learning a somewhat enjoyable process? Self learning to me means reading information provided and writing it down until it's engraved in my memory. Is there a different style of studying I could approach? Do you have any time management tips I should pick up to remain composed?

But either way I sincerely hope you  can understand this and where I'm coming from, and not just label it as ramblings or complaints. Any comments are welcome.*

I am stuck in this endless cycle. I have observed, tracked, &amp; even analyzed my habits, and why I seem to consistantly make the same stupid decisions time after time, even when I know better. Let me break down to you day by day how my life seems to folding out every week so far in this semester.

* **Monday** - Usually had a really good weekend before, which gets me really excited for the possibility of the new week ahead, and all that I could accomplish if I put my mind to it. However, when I wake up Monday morning, I'm tired and not looking forward to another 5 days of work. So what do I do? I decide to first check my Gmail, then my Facebook, then Youtube, Reddit etc, instead of just starting  studying. This seemly, at the time, innocent procrastination quickly spirals into a full blown day wasted by procrastinating, filled with watching movies online, binge eating, not exercising (and to be honest) wanking excessively. The problem is that once you start procrastinating, it is so hard to stop, and just start working – even though that is exactly what you need to do.

* **Tuesday** - Disgusted by the disgusting way I acted/lived on Monday, Tuesday becomes my redeeming day. I make sure I start work straight away. I get in a lot of good study, do some exercise later on, watch what I eat, and even often catch up with friends nearing the end of the day. Overall a really great day that I wouldnt mind copying &amp; pasting to every day of the week.

* **Wednesday** - Wednesday rolls around I am still on a bit of a roll from Tuesday being such a great &amp; productive day! I get to work almost on time, sometimes a bit late, but still start making some good progress with my studies. However as the day progresses, I start procrastinating a tiny bit by tiny bit, each time I reigning myself in, but I start to feel my willpower drain away.

* **Thursday &amp; Friday** - And then there is Thursday followed by Friday. Both days seem to be a lot like doing sprints. I will do a good amount of work, yet spiral out of control &amp; start doing some of the same stuff as on Monday, only to eventually reign myself and get back to work again. This cycle just repeats throughout both days, with the occasional catching up with friends.

* **Saturday &amp; Sunday** - Finally the weekend has arrived, and it seems like life, or more accurately, the joy of living, has arrived with it. Even though my mind is constantly being nagged by the thought of all the work I need to catch up on due to my procrastinating through the week, I still manage to have a blast of the weekend, really enjoying myself &amp; getting out a lot. You feel alive, and suddenly all the problems that weighed you down throughout the week seem so flexible  However the worst thing is that at the end of every week, I come to a point where I promise to myself that the week is going to be my 'bitch' (sorry if annoying takes offense, but it was the best way I could say it), and that I am going to  own it and not repeat the mistakes of the week just ending. Sadly though, when Monday once again rolls around, the exact same thing happens.


Rinse &amp; Repeat. So this has been happening for almost 5 weeks now, and I am wondering how I can stop this. It is currently at the end of a Monday, so I admit that I'm feeling rather depressed at my, once again, failure of today, as I am writing this.

I know that I just have to decide not to do it. I know that I need to make sure I don't turn on my computer first thing on Monday, or that I need to make sure that I pick up one of my study books &amp; start reading on Thursday after lunch, instead of any other distracting activities  Yet I feel like my willpower is fading, and that it is becoming easier for me to make the same mistakes, fall in the same rut,  week by week.

Sure some of you are going to just say “Just DO IT” or “Just DON'T DO IT”. In theory that is true, but when it comes down to that moment when you make that decision, it is never that easy.

Or maybe I am just looking at this all wrong. Maybe somewhere there is something that I have missed, something that will help me get out of this rut. Yet I fear that only hard work, determination, discipline &amp; motivation will be the only things that will help get my crap together. There is no single answer tip or trick that will stop my procrastination and its nasty repercussions in my habits – only willpower....... Sadly, willpower seems to be like an emotion for me, it's here one day, then it floats away the next.

&gt; Self-regulation is an important component of psychosocial theories of exercise behavior and lack of self-regulatory skills are associated with low adherence to health-related exercise. This review presents a strength-energy model of self- control as an **explanation of self-regulation** in exercise contexts. The review will provide impetus for original research aimed at understanding exercise behavior and help develop recommendations for exercise promotion. In the model, self- control is conceptualized as a **global but limited resource**. Engaging in actions requiring self-control depletes resources leading to self-regulatory failure. Self- control resource depletion **is reduced** through rest and frequent training on self- control. The expectation of the need to exert self-control in future leads to a **conservation of self-control resources**. Proposed mechanisms for self-control resource depletion include changes in physiological markers and blood glucose levels. Based on our review, we propose an integrated model of self-regulation incorporating hypotheses from the strength-energy model with those from traditional psychosocial models of exercise behavior. Recommendations for future research include incorporating hypotheses from the strength-energy model into theories of self-presentation and interpersonal relations in exercise. **Practical recommendations** aimed at minimizing self-control depletion in exercise include the provision of advice on nutrition and recovery, self-control training, and motivational and implementation intention strategies.

1355839048.0,15,self.getdisciplined,151uyl,"Move-Scroll-Click, or how to control your internet browsing",neprotivo,18,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/151uyl/movescrollclick_or_how_to_control_your_internet/,"Hi Reddit,

I, like many of you, have difficulty to control myself while browsing the Internet. But I believe that I have just found a method which can allow you to browse as much Reddit, Facebook, Youtube, etc. as you want, while still not letting those sites waste away your life. The method is still in a very rough shape, and I give you no guarantees that it will work. It needs a lot of further work and beta-testing, but I hope that you will find it useful and that you can help me with its further development. 

I will next describe the practice and then try to explain where it comes from and the principles behind it. It applies only if you spend a lot of time browsing using a computer and a mouse. When you browse on your phone or tablet you will have to come up with some appropriate alternative.

This is step 1 of the practice (that is all I have so far). It is as follows: Every time you touch the mouse with your hand you note in your mind **touching**, and every time you lift your hand - **lifting**. While you move the mouse you note **moving, moving**, when you scroll - **scrolling** and when you click - **clicking**. You do this *always*, regardless of whether you are working on your computer, or just having fun. If it is too difficult at first, then you can say those words out loud, but only at the beginning. It will get easier as you keep practicing.

This method is based on a certain Buddhist meditation practice developed by the Burmese monk [Mahasi Sayadaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahasi_Sayadaw). You can read more about the practice [here](http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/mahasit1.pdf). I learned it on a meditation retreat that I visited one year ago. There we were supposed to note in our mind every action that we do throughout the day and do this with as much detail as we can. 

So why should this work? I find that certain activities make my mind get into some kind of a auto-pilot mode. Such activities include computer browsing, watching TV or movies, playing computer games, reading engrossing books, daydreaming etc. When I get into auto-pilot mode, I lose control, while my automatic habitual behavior takes over. I lose track of time. When I finally get out of it, I feel as I have woken up from some sort of a dream-like state.

The purpose of the practice I described above is to prevent getting into auto-pilot mode. You remain fully conscious while browsing Reddit, Facebook, Wikipedia, etc. As you continue practicing you will see that your mind becomes sharper, and that the resolution with which you perceive the world and your own actions greatly increases. You start noticing your cravings as they arise. As you see them, you will get the ability to decide *rationally* whether you should follow them, or not. When a person is rational, they do not do anything that would lead to their own harm. So when you decide that browsing Reddit is harmful, and that you should write your homework instead, you just do it, with very little effort and with practically no resistance. The only negative side is that if you practice diligently, you might discover that Reddit is much less entertaining than you thought.

I hope this helps you. As I said this method needs a lot of further work. For example it might make sense as a step 2 of the practice, to label at least some of the keyboard actions as well. Also, at a later stage, which would be steps 3,4 and so on, one might add **watching** (a Youtube clip), **reading**(a Reddit post), **wanting** (to click on a link, to write a comment, etc.), **intending**(to do what you wanted to do) and so on. If you decide to try it, it would be great if you post your account on how it works for you and what modifications you have developed. If this catches on it might even make sense to make a special subreddit about it.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_151uyl,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/151uyl/movescrollclick_or_how_to_control_your_internet/,

So a little backstory here, I came back to college this year (I am a sophmore) and everything started off great. I was going to class, eating very healthy losing weight and gaining muscle, doing homework socializing, life was good. I had a fairly early midterm in one of my classes, which was a prerequisite to a certificate I really really wanted to do... And I bombed.

And from then on the spiral begins, I was extremely let down and felt very guilty because I wasn't totally in exam mode yet and so I did really badly. Anyways I pulled myself back together sort of, I socialized less and just stayed in my room gaming and when the second miterm came around I studied hard, like for 5 days straight and pretty much ignored the other midterm for another class on the next day because I was doing fine in that class. And I pretty much got the same score on the second midterm.

This is when the bad stuff begins, I started spiraling downwards I was so disheartened by this class. I felt like I had done everything I could to prepare for it and nothing came out of it. I couldn't drop it now and so I had to stick it through. I probably deserved my first midterm score, but for this one I did honestly try my best, and I know i studied harder than anyone I knew in that class. After this point I pretty much went into a hole, staying on my computer all day just playing games and not doing work or going to class because I was so disheartened with everything in school. This whole spiral has continued for the rest of the quarter (I am on the quarter system instead of semester) and I don't like myself like this, I really don't but I honestly have no idea how to pick myself back up. Before I was a healthy guy who enjoyed going to the gym and socializing and being there for my friends and being successful in all my classes (I had a 3.6 GPA but lets see what I get after this quarter) while still being an avid gamer. Now I am an unhealthy, chubby, lazy guy who sits in his room playing video games and not seeing any of his friends. I need to change and I want to change and I want to pull myself back together. I am basically reverting back to my old ways before I lost all my weight and changed myself immensely. I was obese, lazy, forgetful, sat all day on my computer and just a plain slob. 


Any advice appreciated...

tl;dr : constant awful grades in a class have changed me into a disgusting slob hermit.

1351858822.0,15,self.getdisciplined,12ie6q,(first post) Seeking advice on building good habits/discipline while chronically ill/in chronic pain,candlesandfish,15,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/12ie6q/first_post_seeking_advice_on_building_good/,"Hi all,

I've been trying for years and years to get everything together and get things done, and to a greater or lesser degree I managed until I got sick in 2007 and ended up bed bound/housebound for about a year and a half, got a bit better and sort of got things together and then got very very sick again last year and I'm now moderately housebound (I get out to go to doctors, if other people drive me (and I'm careful) and on the odd occasion my health will let me do the things I want to). I'm 24.

I've got ME/CFS - Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, aka Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (google the two to see why we don't like the second name). I basically feel like I have a bad case of the flu, all the time, and my energy levels are limited, as well as waking up with inflamed nerves everywhere pretty much every day. This adds an extra dimension to the 'I don't want to get out of bed' that I have to fight. Bonus points for the fact that I usually feel better once I get up, get moving, and my brain is distracted from the pain, which doesn't go away but is just backgrounded. Logically I know I should get up, but I am literally fighting my body's screams of GO BACK TO SLEEP AND DON'T MOVE BECAUSE THEN IT DOESN'T HURT. And then I finally do get up and try to do things.

It's very easy, and quite practical, to stay in bed all day. And to a certain degree I need to stay resting on my bed, although not necessarily *in* bed - I can make the bed and sit/lie on top of it and do things. If I am careful, I can do things like cook, sew (I make my own clothes a bit), stitch (almost all chronically ill people pick a handicraft to stop us going nuts, embroidery is mine), read or do some work or even cleaning/tidying, to a small degree. Lots of physical activity without a long rest in between bouts is bad and makes the pain spike for a few days. It's usually not worth it.

I'm looking for advice on how to get progress done on certain activities (especially if I can apply it to new things as well when they come along) given my limitations - it's not just a case of convincing myself to get up in the morning or 'just do it'. I *am* capable of achieving SOMETHING though, and I really seem to be all or nothing.

I figure you guys have done the motivational stuff I've been trying for ages, but are tougher/more experienced with this stuff and could have some good advice, hence my posting here.

Here are the things I'd really like to start doing:

- getting dressed every day (being an invalid and not having to go out of the house means I often don't get out of my pyjamas for a day or so)

- saying AM &amp; PM prayers (I'm Eastern Orthodox Christian (Greek Orthodox etc) and we have a set practice of prayers, which are written down, to do each day. AM takes about 5min, PM 15min, and mostly I'm just lazy/unmotivated/feeling like a zombie)

- getting something done towards each of my goals each day

goals:

- cleaning/tidying my room - there are piles, categorised by type, everywhere in my room. Magazines, books (although this is slightly better now that I've acquired a second bookshelf), a giant mound of worn-once-but-not-dirty clothing, boxes, a box of stuff I cleared off my dresser which is miscellaneous, as well as other Misc stuff. It needs to not be on my floor, and stay off my floor! 

- get back into cooking - I love to cook, and theoretically I can, but usually I end up staying in bed all day and not achieving anything. I don't *have* to cook, since one of my parents usually will, but it would be nice if I did. Even if it's cookies, or cake, or marmalade. Bonus points if it's dinner.

- get through my 'to be read' list, instead of just killing time on the internet. I love books. I have lots of good ones to read. And here I am on the internet again!

- get something done on a paper for college that was due in may but I have medical extensions for. It's now got so far out from semester that despite my acquiring books, I can't seem to get started. It's 3000 words. 

mini-goals: 

- finishing cutting (almost done) and then sew up a dress that's currently on our living room couch (cutting: 1 hour, sewing: 5 hours)

- sew dress #2 that I have fabric for (cutting: 1 hour, sewing: 5 hours)

- finish sewing a pair of pants that have been half done for about a month

I've been unemployed for 6 months now and I've been struggling to find anything other than 2 weeks factory packing work at a time.

Thing is, I'm not stupid. I go to the Job Centre and I feel like I'm surrounded by people who just stand little chance of finding decent work.

I left school at 16 (normal age for the UK) with pretty decent grades (11 GCSEs grade A-C) but then it all went downhill from there. I went to college but I felt like I had no direction and I didn't know what to do with my life. My Anxiety disorder would get the better of me and I'd find it hard around exam periods and I found applying to university impossible. My grades suffered and I dropped out... 3 times. I swore each time would be better than the last and I swore I'd do something different every time but I never did.

So now, since dropping out the last time, I feel like I've achieved nothing and I hate myself for it. I'm embarrassed that I'm long term unemployed when my school friends are off getting degrees. I was considered a 'smart kid' in my year group and I'm lagging behind severely. I don't want my life to be like this, I want to achieve something and be proud of myself.

I'm thinking of applying for (yet another) college course for September. It's an accountancy course. It will be 2 evenings a week which means I can work around it (hopefully in accountancy based admin or something related) and attain some level of freedom (currently living at home and have a severely toxic relationship with my mother). In 3 years, I'd be a fully qualified accountant.  I'm scared I'm going to drop out again. I'm scared there's something wrong with me. I'm scared that I won't be able to do it.

- This implies I even get onto the course, which I don't even see as likely.

Let me explain. For me external inspiration works but fizzles out in a day or sooner, good habits start but eventually get mechanistic, to the point where one feels this may be a deterministic universe and we are its gears. This robotic approach is fine for a few days after which the existential angst kicks in and ruins any good work done. Mood sucks, life's shit, u know? At this point would a tab of LSD really be that bad? If used responsibly they flush down the toxins in those gears, leaving me refreshed and enraged (in a good way). The next few weeks 10-12 will be akin to living the dream.. no boredom or procrastinating, internally motivated system working on a self-feedback loop, solid meditation and physical exercise schedule, good sleep, hours after hours of caffeine less productive and creative work. A eventually a deep sense of satisfaction that seems impossible to usher in a sober state.

For example, I have leechblock on my computer and all browsers except one disabled. Basically every time-wasting site that I've used is on there so I get 4 minutes a day which should be enough. I've also blocked most sites on the internet using a wild card except for productive/educational ones and I get five minutes every quarter of an hour to look at those. I'm not sure if this last bit works very well though.
 
If I want to get past this, I have to reactivate Internet Explorer and use that which takes about five minutes. Alternatively, I can copy a 126 character code to open up my options for leechblock to disable it. This doesn't take very long but it is annoying because I have to spend at least a bit of effort doing it and can't really do anything else. Also, I sometimes get the code wrong a few times and it is immensely frustrating. 

One of the reasons why I spend so much time on the internet is because of laziness. I don't have to spend any effort at all and I'm addicted to instant gratification. The effort to reward ratio is extremely high. Essentially, it's laziness. When I do this, my laziness is winning. By making it harder to do, it is often just easier to pick up a book and read it. Rather than waiting 10 minutes to access more sites, I might want to do something else and completely forget about the (usually trite) thing I've been looking at. **The productive option becomes the lazier option**. My laziness is turned into a form of discipline. If I see myself becoming more disciplined/less lazy in the future, I will still be doing the same things.
It also reminds me that what I'm planning to do is something I don't really want to do on an intellectual level so it's harder to fall into that trap where you lose hours and gain nothing. 

Some other stuff I do is to put my laptop in a small cardboard box and fill it with books. Close it, put books on top of it and then put that box inside a larger box. I also separate the charger and put them in different places. It wouldn't take more than five minutes to get everything back again but the idea of doing it really makes me question whether going on sites is worth it or something I actually want to do. 

I used to wake up and go on my laptop straight away but that doesn't really happen any more. As someone who used to spend hours on the internet each day, there have now been times where I considered not going on it at all. It seems like such a small thing to most people but to me it is a huge improvement.

There are still times where I binge on the internet but not as much and I'm hoping that this system will generally still work. There are some things I still need to work through with this but I'm pretty hopeful about it; It's something that's worked for me when so many other systems haven't. The main problem is 'forgetting' to put my laptop back once I've done everything that I needed to do or reactivating IE/disabling leechblock because I really want to continue reading just one thing and I swear I'll come off it as soon as I've seen it, which is often not the case. This problem is not internal to the system but comes from not really following it.

I'm sure you can find ways to apply this to your own problems. For example, if you play games too much, uninstall them. You can reinstall them when you want but ugh so much effort and you'd have to uninstall after you play them. For MMORPGs, maybe change your password to some ridiculously long randomly generated character sequence, write it down on a piece of paper and put it somewhere where you have to physically get up and go looking for it. If you want to get extreme, write different parts of the password on different pieces of paper and separate them. Of course this runs the risk of you losing the password forever.

&gt; “The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company...a church....a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude...I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. And so it is with you...we are in charge of our attitudes.”

I'm a 24 year old male with bipolar who's been an undergrad for going on 5 years. It took me 4 years to get an associate's degree in Web Design. When I got out of that program, I decided that I would go to a bigger university and get a BS in Marketing. I figured I could apply both degrees and become a successful entrepreneur building websites. 

That was... Until I actually started my business classes. I hate them. I can't stand thinking about contribution margins, marginal cost, etc. I finished last year with a 1.8 GPA. It brought my transferred, overall GPA down from a 3.3 to a 2.75. 

After some serious thought I decided that I would go with my original love, computer science. I abandoned computer science when it got too hard (I was one of those ""smart"" kids. Didn't realize the damage that did until very recently) The problem is, I'm looking at 3 more years of school. That'll be 8 years for an undergrad (ten if I pursue a masters, which I'm pretty sure I will). I'll have $60k+ debt in student loans (if they hold out), I'll be close to thirty, and all my friends will have been in their careers or done with their graduate programs by the time I'm finished.

I should also mention that I made the boneheaded, split second decision to go into marketing when I was on a manic high over the summer. My study habits were amazing and I was applying myself really hard. I came down from that high about a month or two into last semester so fast and hard that I absolutely crumbled. I felt lost and all of my confidence and motivation crumbled as well.

I have such high expectations of myself. I have so many ideas and goals I want to achieve, but I feel cheated because I was never complimented on my hard work as a kid, but praised because I was ""smart"". I never developed the skills to apply myself. I feel like I have only very recently started to grow up. I feel so behind. I see kids 6 years younger than me with more drive than anything I ever had. I want that.

So, I'm asking you guys: what are some actions I can take? How do I build those habits? Are there tricks that I should be doing? I'm willing to try anything!

1361483064.0,14,self.getdisciplined,18z9po,"Should I measure how well I'm doing in terms of time spent working, or in terms of actual results?",gothgirl420666,19,5,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/18z9po/should_i_measure_how_well_im_doing_in_terms_of/,"I keep running into this problem over and over when I am thinking about how to work harder and be more productive. (Also, I'm new here, so sorry if I'm missing something obvious).

It seems to me that I have a choice. I could simply strive to spend as much time as possible working on my projects, believing that this approach will get me results. If I work for six hours straight, but accomplish nothing, then I can still reward myself afterwards. 

However, I could also take the approach that, in fact, results are the only thing that actually matter. If I work for six hours straight, but accomplish nothing, that time is wasted. Hopefully, tomorrow I can be more productive. Additionally, with this ideology, if I am tired and have a lot on my mind and I do not believe that working will be productive at this point in time, I can play video games or something guilt-free, because I probably wouldn't have achieved much anyway.

**Arguments in favor of taking the TIME approach:**

* Variations on ""skill is simply a direct result of sheer amount of time working on said skill"". E.g. ""practice, practice, practice"", ""if you want to be a good artist, draw all the time"", ""stop wasting your time reading tutorials on how to paint and just PAINT"", the 10,000 hours idea. 
* It leads to less stress and takes less willpower to tell myself ""just sit down and work for two hours, the outcome doesn't actually matter"" than it does to constantly be worrying about if i'm maximizing my productivity or not. 
* Not working because I feel like I'm in an unproductive state is just a poor excuse. If I really want to achieve results, I should work regardless of whether or not I'm tired, distracted, don't feel like it, etc. There will never be a time when I can't think of some excuse not to work, so doing this will end up with me basically never working. 
* Oftentimes it simply cannot be helped that a project requires lots of time before noticeable results are achieved. If I don't allow myself to spend four hours working and have nothing to show of it, I will inevitably feel like I am getting nothing done. (Or worse, somehow end up with ""task ADD"" and end up *actually* never getting anything done.) Also, I'll feel guilty for not achieving as much as I feel like I should have a lot because of the planning fallacy. I will end up 
* Allowing myself to ""loosen up"" and not constantly worry about the fastest way to achieve results might result in more creative outcomes. 
* If I were following the results approach and I were, for example, trying to simply create ten drawings as fast as I can, I would probably put less care into each one than I would if I were to tell myself that I will spend ten hours drawing and be happy with however many I make. This seems like it would lead to a) an inferior product and b) stagnation, because I would not have the focus and attention to detail that is required to improve my drawing skills. 

**Arguments in favor of taking the RESULTS approach:**

* While it is true that pretty much anyone spending massive amounts of time working on something will eventually become good at it, there are more and less efficient ways of doing so. Googling ""anatomy tutorials"" and reading for an hour could help a young artist much more effectively than spending 24 hours drawing stick figure cartoons, hoping that at some point an epiphany will be made. The dude who does Homestuck, for example, has stated that he hasn't improved at art at all the whole time the comic has been running, despite spending like 4 hours a day drawing, simply because he's been focusing on improving at storytelling and humor instead. Believing in ""10,000 hours"" truisms on blind faith seems silly. 
* If I can focus on achieving meaningful, concrete results every day, I'll feel much better about my progress than if it appears to me that I'm spending long periods of time working with nothing to show for it. 
* It's silly to spend time working when I'm tired, because I'm probably not going to achieve much, and then I'll beat myself up about not achieving much, and then I'll feel bad. It would be much better for my mental health if I simply watched TV when I felt tired, and the boost in happiness would more than offset the small drop in productivity. Plus, I've seen a lot of material that claims ""80% of your progress comes from 20% of your time"", ""you need to work smarter, not harder"", ""working less can actually boost productivity"", etc. 
* If I regularly allow myself to spend four hours working and have nothing to show for it, I've given myself leeway to slack off as much as possible, just as long as I'm doing something that could be considered ""working"". (i.e. sitting at my desk with my sketchbook open, doodling and ""thinking"" for long periods of time)

As you can see, it's not easy to choose between these two approaches. It's pretty clear that this is a false dilemma, and that there are a whole range of options in between. The optimal strategy is probably somewhere in that middle area, but then again, not necessarily. Perhaps I can find some sort of compromise that takes advantage of the benefits of both approaches as much as possible, while also minimizing the downsides of each. 

So what do you guys use? Is there any good literature on the subject? Is time or results motivation more likely to put you/people in a state of flow? Is there a good way to combine the two?

1357732147.0,13,self.getdisciplined,168tcf,How to learn habits: an improved chain method,neprotivo,17,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/168tcf/how_to_learn_habits_an_improved_chain_method/,"Hi,

I want to describe a modification of the chain/Seinfield method for learning a new habit. I have been practicing it for about two months and so far it seems to work.

The chain method is as follows: You mark on your calendar every day when you do activity X. After some time a chain forms. Then your goal is not to break the chain. 

Unfortunately for me, after the initial motivation wears out, I always break the chain. I say to myself, ""It's no big deal that you didn't do X today, you have done it for so long already."" But then I break the chain again and again, and eventually I realize that I haven't done X for weeks.

So this is where the modification comes in. You pick a sum of money **S**. This sum should be small enough so that you can still live comfortably after spending **4*S** each month, and it should be large enough so that spending it makes you feel slightly uneasy. You pick another sum of money **M**. This should be much larger than **S**, I recommend at least **M&gt;12*S**. Then you resolve that you are going to donate a given sum of money to a good cause of your choice every time you break your chain without having a good reason. The sum you donate is given by the formula **min(M,W*S)**, where **W** is the number of whole weeks that you have managed to keep the chain since your last relapse.

The only requirement to make this work is to hold on to this rule fanatically. You need to convince yourself that if you break the chain you *will* pay. So it might actually be helpful to have a couple of relapses at the beginning. They will give you the opportunity to prove to yourself that you will hold on to this no matter what.

I am currently using this method to refrain from fapping and to learn to meditate daily. I plan to add a new habit next week and then to continue adding more habits in the following weeks. It is a good idea not to start too many new habits at once, but to add a new habit every 2-3 weeks or so. Otherwise you won't remember all of them and you are bound to fail.

I hope this helps you.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_168tcf,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/168tcf/how_to_learn_habits_an_improved_chain_method/,

So here's the deal. I'm a senior in college and I've already found out that I've been accepted to medical school. Yay, right? Except I've noticed that ever since finding that out, I've been kind of wandering around aimlessly. My GPA is stellar and the classes I'm taking this and next semester are easy so I'm putting in the least amount of effort into class that I've ever done in my life.

Based on my experience and some sources I looked up.,sexymanraptor,14,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/10e0cw/develop_a_habit_based_on_my_experience_and_some/,"&gt; [Start With Reading This](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/10cbao/my_story_on_how_i_became_a_productive_person_and/)

The post is about how you can only achieve goals efficiently and effectively but most important, how you will stick to it. Good job. You are in the right place for looking up into getting motivated, that's one small baby step kid. Now let's run.

**1. What do you want to achieve from this?** Well you want motivation, here you go. /r/GetMotivated is a drive thru. You go here, read some photo about a guy working hard on his ass and then you're off. Good. But not good enough, what If I don't want to post a picture anymore? Where the hell do you go? I suggest you go to /r/GetDisciplined GM is for wolves, you come here, we'll kick your spartan ass and turn your profession into a warrior. Now back to the main point, what do you do after all this? You got the motivation the discipline, was it worth it? Yes maybe, no for some but it will be trust me. Just set up a goal, Make a long goal. Be it lose weight, finish college, get a job. Then an intermediate goal that you can achieve easily before you achieve the longer goal. It has to be in weeks range or months, like lose 10 pounds, or 1 pound or run a 5k or pass the exams. Awesome! Lastly, the most important part of setting up goals is the small ones, these has to be many as you can but in easiest intensities. Example, jog for an hour, stand up from the couch, wash dishes, read a book, study for an hour. These are developments of **habits** we'll go into that further later.

**2. How do I do it?** If you read the post on the link in the earlier parts even if it's just tl;dr he included then you have a good idea how to do it.  But if you don't, no problem! There's lots of ways to develop a habit. Now, a habit is something you regularly do everyday. Name things you do everyday? EATING. SLACKING. LAZING. Brushing your teeth, clothing, bathing and many more. How did develop them? through time? Yes, but I assure you, you got those habits within the first 30days of doing it. Same concept goes for quitting gaming/smoking/drinking. Stop for a day, you'll crave. Continue for a week, you'll urge. Finish a month, you'll stop. Unless you're addicted then you need medical help. Habits will take a big part on how you achieve your goal. If you make these few days count, you'll make the rest of your successful life count. tic toc mate.

**3. Track your progress.** Well I'll feel bad if I'm working my ass off and I don't see results. But do I ever give up? Nope. The term ""giving up"" is something other people say. Up to this point you are now a warrior. A shining shimmering, abs encrusted Spartan warrior. Tell me something, from the movie 300 there's one thing I learned there that is almost a summary on how successful people succeed. &gt; ""No Retreat, No surrender. That is Spartan law.""
You see? That is one bad-ass quote. And there's a scene in the movie where they kill some Persian and make walls out of its corpses, and they make walls one at a time, wave by wave of Persians. Cutting them off slowly. Persian corpses are your goals, you making those corpse walls are your habits, moving closer and closer to Xerxes is your progress. Xerxes is your long term goal. But that slimy fucking hunchback spartan traitor is your demotivator, he will make you weak and ultimately defeat you. King Leonidas showed him mercy and spared his life and little did he know that It would be the same reason that would kill him and his men. But nooo, you won't do that wont you? Don't back down even if you get demotivated. You fall hard, you fight. You get up, you fight. You don't give up. There is a thin line between the difference between death and defeat. Death is when you quit, defeat is when you die fighting and you're still fighting. Fists up warrior.

**4. When you finish your goals, make new ones.** By the time you finished with step 3. You have already made a good habit. Hoorah! 30 days should have passed and I am now looking at a better person. He did not lose that much goal weight, he barely passed his exam, he almost finished that 5k in record time and he almost finished his goals. Hey, that was the goal in the first place. To run, you didn't exactly surpass those goals or accomplished them as planned but hey, I told you in the first place, I'll teach you how to run for those goals. And my ohh my, here you are running for them. Awesome. Now let's get flying, Ohh impossible you said, well If you wanna reach your goals further then you should put more effort into it! If you already reached you goals then damn it, make more goals! Improvement never stops at losing 20pounds or after the 5k or when you stand up from the couch. No my friend, ""Be better than who you were yesterday."" Live up to that. I'm proud of you if you finished those goals already but don't stop there. You have built up a habit by now. To fly, you need discipline. Discipline doesn't take 30 days to develop. It's a state of mind. When you have control over it, you can do anything. That's the secret. Men have asked questions before that they found the answers to themselves and they searched for it. Socrates didn't have the internet. They strives to be better, to know better and more. So why shouldn't you? Line up maggot, Get Disciplined.

[This is for getting an idea on how to make goals. I for one started to do things I can't before and have the fear of doing. Like handstands and cartwheels. I fall often and those falls are awesome.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/zmgxh/this_is_how_i_want_to_live/)

TL;DR 

**1. Why?** Make long, intermediate and short goals. A ""seemingly"" impossible long goal. An intermediate goal that is achievable within a week, a month or a year. And a lot of short goals that you can do easily but frequently. Do short goals repeatedly if you want to develop that habit.

**2. How?** Read the first link at the very top. That's actually it.

**3. Track it.** Your progress, to keep you going. To build up an idea that you are achieving or have achieved something great and that you are striving to achive something greater.

**4. Repeat steps 1 to 3.** we'll not necessarily, you just need to learn how to make a habit. After that develop a discipline.

This pretty much sums up what I've been feeling at work. I know I should get something done, but like a post I saw earlier, I seem to only motivate myself once the deadline looms in front of me. 

I have an hour commute to work everyday, so I started listening to Audio books. For whatever reason, maybe its only an hour long, maybe its read with some personality. I like what I heard and tried to put it into practice. 

I found a PDF that has the main points. 

http://media.briantracy.com/downloads/pdf/mosd_10page.pdf

There are a few points I struggle with. The clearer thinking is one. There are also a few points inside the habits I don't agree with, such as the healthy eating. 

I can however already see the benefits of time management, and focusing on one task rather than multitasking. I find situations at work where I need to make a call, or confront someone over a problem. I will actually sit there an tell myself ""I can do it, I can do it"" I'll get out of the chair and I will do it. 

Maybe if people read or listen to this, we can have a discussion about how we have incorporated these into our lives. Which parts we find useful, and help to improve the parts we don't. Rubbish this if you want, but be constructive. Lets improve ourselves.

You start the day with the best intentions of doing the most important item first. 

You sit in front of the computer, you hit a roadblock and start feeling uncomfortable. Your brain starts talking, hey let's do something else. There is so much other work to do. 

Suddenly someone interrupts you, and you are busy with something else. You spend the day working on the other nine items of lower importance. 

Worse, you waste the time on mindless web surfing or watching videos. 

You look back at the day with mixed feelings. Sometimes you justify that you were productive or sometimes feel awful. 

---------

Our brains and bodies are wired to seek comfort. 

Exercise is uncomfortable, so we sit on the sofa and watch TV.

Creative or Important work is uncomfortable, so we spend the day doing busywork. 

Standing up for something you believe if uncomfortable, so we discard our beliefs and conform to the norms in society or business even though it just does not make any sense. 

Seeking comfort is the default state of the mind. It will make you physically and intellectually lazy and bring untold misery if you let it. 

Seeking comfort -&gt; Gratification now, Misery in the long run 

Enduring discomfort and pain -&gt; Smile of satisfaction now, Happiness in the long run 

--------------

**What really happened inside the brain?**

Whenever we find something difficult or uncomfortable, there is an urge, a 'fight' or 'flight' response. We either choose to fix the problem or run away from it. 

**How does the urges help us?**

This default state of mind worked very well in the hunterer-gatherer society. It helped us avoid wild animals, avoid extreme weather conditions and survive. 

But, the current society is different. 

We still feel uncomfortable doing certain kinds of work because of any of the following : 

* it is hard and you don't know whether it is the right way, or 
* we lack skills, or 
* the fear of what others will say about our work, or
* any reason you can think of

It is good to have fear, you are a normal human being. But none of the above reasons would kill you. Yups, you will not get killed if complete the hard and uncomfortable work of exercise, creative work etc. 

**What is the connection between urges and productivity?**

Everyday you get a finite amount of time - 24 hours and a finite amount of willpower. 

The willpower gets depleted during the day. And is at its weakest when you are tired or sleep deprived. 

If you are on an internet binge in the late hours of night, it is difficult to stop yourself with lower willpower. 

On the other hand, if you work on the most important things in the morning. You use that high willpower to accomplish greater value tasks. 

----------------------

**How to deplete willpower as fast as possible?**

* Avoid the work that is important. 
* Seek out what's new on social networks like facebook or reddit. Distractions are a very good way to deplete willpower. 
* Consume lots of food. Since a major part of your body energy is spent on digesting food, you will feel lethargic in a few moments. And that will make you lazy and low on willpower. 
* Consume lots of information. Your brain will be entertained and stimulated by all the TV shows or youtube that you watch. You need more and more dopamine to trigger the same feeling of satisfaction in your brain. You have to spend more and more time each day. 
* Don't block uninterrupted times of day for completing the important assignments. They will be done when they are done. Then you can waste your finite willpower doing unimportant tasks. 
* Watch advertisements, go to shopping sites, check out items that you would like to buy. Tempting advertisements and window shopping helps you destroy your willpower. 

------------------------

**How to increase willpower?**

Good sleep, exercise and meditation would help you to increase your willpower. 

Good sleep - Being tired and sleep deprived reduces your willpower and you give in to urges more easily. Good sleep refreshes you mentally and physically. 

Exercise - Exercise make you more energetic, increases your blood flow and etc. etc. If you have more physical energy, it helps in having more willpower. 

Meditation - For a given period of time, you watch your thoughts, feelings, emotions and sensations and do not react. You get better at watching the urges and observing them. You are building a counter habit to the natural comfort seeking one. Personally I do [Vipassana](http://www.dhamma.org/) meditation. 

The counter-habit of observing urges and not reacting helps to conserve the willpower. But you are not 100% perfect when you start the habit of meditation. So willpower will still get depleted, albeit in a slower manner. 

Please Note : The willpower will still get depleted during the day as you do work, take decisions and get distracted. 

**How to be more productive, despite the willpower depletion?**

* Schedule your most important work in the mornings. Block a 2 hour or 3 hour time chunk without any distractions or interruptions or email or internet (if possible) and *complete* it. Do not cave in to your primitive mind despite what it says. 

* Congratulate yourself if you take action once on the above point. Now make it a point to do it every single day. 

* Similarly block chunks of time to do other important tasks and don't get distracted. By the way, in the corporate culture there are meetings where we block time chunks to discuss important issues. Avoid turning wasting chunks of times into futile or pointless meetings. Make that time chunk count. Ship something.

* Whenever you make a decision to do something, estimate the number of hours to accomplish it and put it in your calendar. That way you will not have any false notions of time. If it is a bigger project, break it into smaller pieces, estimate hours and block your calendar.

* Resist watching TV or advertisement boards or youtube videos till the evening. These are designed to tempt us and distract us. Advertising is the art and science of tempting, distracting and seducing people to buy.

A big thanks for reading so far, hope the article helps you and inspires you to take action. It is based on my experiences and battles with work. 

Some books and resources that have helped me : 

* The Willpower Instinct - [Book on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583334386) and [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5BXuZL1HAg) (56 mins.)
* [Vipassana](http://www.dhamma.org/) meditation - I personally practice it and have good results
* [Eat the Frog](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576754227/) - Brian Tracy

------------------

tldr; 

Some of my notes while reading the Willpower Instinct - 

What helps build up  willpower -

1. Meditation

2. Good Sleep - 7 to 8 hours a day

3. Not fighting or avoiding negative thoughts or behaviours, just let them be and focus on meditation or work

4. Surfing the urge, Facing it in its true form and not giving in

5. Replace habits, change I won't do it to I will do that

6. Understand dopamine addiction, train yourself to look for the dopamine triggers, surf the urge and not give in

7. Reverse dopamine strategy, to tackle difficult or boring tasks by chunking them down or rewarding yourself
 The 10-minute strategy of doing something or not giving in to your craving.

8. Pre-commitment - Sometimes it is good to burn the ships and keep fighting.

9. Social Proof - If more people are doing it you tend to do it too. Find out groups of people who are doing what you would like to do. 

10. When trying to form the target behaviour and escaping the undesirable one, promise to donate to something you hate if you follow the undesirable behaviour. Increasing the stakes would keep you on the right track.

1) Stop watching Television. I never really used to ""watch"" TV, it was mostly on in the background, and I'd watch Family Guy/American Dad before I went to sleep, the same old shows, the same jokes, over and over again. Turn it off.

- Something good that has come from doing it. It no longer prevents my mind from wandering, when I'm at home I'm more aware, more focused, more motivated to do something. The days a longer, especially when I don't have to work. The Earth is pretty loud once you start listening to it.

2) Stop with the Porn. I'm sure this has been said before but it's pretty bad... /r/NoFap is in the sidebar. This is something that takes a bit of brain power, a lot of people relapse.

- Good things to come from this. In addition to the television being off, I'm more in-tune with my body, my cravings and wants. For me, this meant more sex, but also there wasn't pressure to have sex in a particular time bracket between two shows or before a show or after a show or before the game etc etc. 

3) Stand. Up. Straight. Take a good look at your posture in the mirror! Mine is terrible, I really can't believe I used to walk around like that all the time, the worst body language on the planet.

- Good things to come from this? One word, confidence. Holding your head ""high"" seemed like a spoiled sort of ""born with a silver spoon in your mouth"" sort of thing, but it's not. It's a confidence thing, take pride in yourself and stand tall. I've gained probably 2.5-3 INCHES in height just by standing up straight.

I really think that being and staying disciplined is a constant battle. 

I think of it a lot like fighting. I probably relate a lot of things to combat because I know a lot of boxing, jiu-jitsu, and various martial arts. If you train on a regular basis in those fighting arts you are rarely stagnant. You never stay at the same skill level. Yes, sometimes you do plateau, but that is really just an illusion as you are actually getting better but at a much slower rate. If you stop training, you start getting worse.

The same thing can be said for discipline. It's something I work at, something I'm always tweaking and perfecting. I try out new ways of doing things, try different systems, invent my own systems etc... Now I'm a fairly goal oriented guy, and I've achieved success in many different areas of my life, but being disciplined is STILL a daily struggle for me. 

There are still days where I catch myself just blowing the whole day watching TV. Yeah, it happens. Does that mean I regressed completely? Nope, I just have to pick myself up and live more mindfully the next day. 

Sometimes I will get on a roll, being really productive for 5, 6 or 7 days in a row. Then that 8th day comes around and I miss some of my daily goals, or maybe in general I just feel like I didn't try very hard at all. I suppose the point I'm trying to make is this:

**There is no point in which being disciplined is now effortless.**

I know that's a fairly obvious statement if you think about it, but when I was younger I was under the impression that if I was my 'ideal self' then being disciplined would be easy. Easy as eatin' pancakes. Now that I have achieved some success in the self-discipline area of my life, I realize that habits definitely make things EASIER, but rarely is anything effortless. 

There is no, ""I know kung-fu"" moment. What do you all think? Do you agree with me? Disagree?

Things which I think caused resistance: 

- Feeling of time pressure: Makes me feel forced, lets the task seem unpleasant, which is why I try to distract myself from it.

- Responsibilty for the outcome: Fear of not meeting my standards

- Other tasks I have -&gt; Makes me feel overwhelmed, incapable of getting it done.

I began reading and listening to audio books by great authors and writers who made some remarkable points. Today, officially marks a week since I started this challenge and I am going strong. I would like to share these past 7 days (and hopefully the next 7 days and so on) with you guys the /r/getdisciplined community, where my road-trip started. Hopefully, this can be of use to people who are trying to get disciplined just like me. 


**Tip 1: Write it DOWN!**

Buy a small notebook/journal and note down your thoughts, to-do list, and other things. At first, I didn't believe that writing down ideas, thoughts and day planners would help me. It just seemed that I am going to waste my time writing down stuff when I can just do stuff. But in the past 7 days, I've entered in a journal entry everyday and made a day plannar for tomorrow the night before, every. day. By writing something down, you get it out of your mind and onto paper. It gives a great feel of ""getting it off your chest."" I would recommend that if you are trying to get disciplined, buy a small notebook and start entering journal entries and making to-do lists.


*What to write down in your Notebook/Journal*

* Write down 5 things that you liked and 5 things you didn't like in your day (EVERYDAY). It is very important that you are honest with yourself because lying to yourself isn't a good way to start getting disciplined. For example, If you were lazy today, write it down. If you finished your assignment ahead of time, write it down. If you helped a stranger, write it down.
* Write down what you are going to do tomorrow, but do it like this: Write down a task you want to accomplish tomorrow. Now in front of the task write an A - for most important tasks, B - for moderately important tasks, and C - for least important tasks. The key is to complete at least **ONE** task each day for 7 days. Then two tasks each day for the next 7 days and so on. However, never start a B task if you an A task and never start a C task if you have a B task. I've been doing this for the past 7 days and it helps a lot. This way you can finish important tasks, instead of finishing easy tasks and feeling like you did a lot in a day, when really you just did few easy tasks here and there. In my experience, the first few days, I completed only 1 task a day but the feeling of ""getting it done"" made me want to do more tasks. So I began doing 2-3 task in a day. When you complete a task, strike it out and move on to the next task. Every time I strike out a task from the list, I get this great feeling of success and always get a great smile on my face and immediately want to begin my next task. Lastly, if you don't get through all the tasks in one day, don't worry. As long as you complete one task (remember important tasks first) you finish some work and can move the rest of the tasks for tomorrow.
* You can also write down whatever you feel you need to talk about. 
* (Optional) Also you can write down the **Goal Of The Day**. Underneath the task list, write down one goal you want to accomplish. You can set a goal to talk to a stranger, ask a question in class or simply the goal of completing at least 2 tasks today.



Now I am *no* expert at this by only going at for 7 days, I have a long road a head of me and I have much more to learn. I just wanted to share my experience and share the things that are working for me in getting disciplined with others. I will most likely post every 7 days with another tip and share what has been working for me that week.

1359157819.0,12,self.getdisciplined,17ac6h,"There is no PFM Pill, so stop searching for one and start logging hours.",BluePatriot,15,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/17ac6h/there_is_no_pfm_pill_so_stop_searching_for_one/,"*Fitness FACT* - There is no magic pill, shake, diet, or surgery that will make you fit and healthy in a day. All of these supplements out there are exactly that, a supplement. A supplement is something that is added to help fill a deficiency. It is not the answer to your problem; it is a means to assist you in getting to your goal. Hard work, discipline, and dedication to yourself is what will get you fit, healthy, and looking good naked.

 
The supplement industry has a very aggressive marketing strategy, and a very shady set of morals. They show perfect physical specimens, what ‘everyone’ wants to look like, the guys or gals with the physique of a Greek God. They lead you to believe that if you take product x, y, or z then you too will look like that. What they fail to include is that this model has busted their ass day in and day out, taking who knows what, or even going completely natural in the gym to get their body. It wasn’t the product they are endorsing, it was their hard work and lifting the weights that got them into that photo shoot, you can put any product in there, it really doesn’t matter - the body of the model was made in the gym, not in the lab.

 
There are a few reasons to supplement that I agree with. Taking a pill to make up for a deficiency you can’t get elsewhere is one of them. My wife hates fish, so we never eat it or have it in the house. So I bought a bottle of Omega3 complex. I would rather get these nutrients from natural food, but sometimes you have to accommodate, and that was a battle I was not going to win. During my deployments to the Middle East we all would take some form of supplementation due to the fact that the food we consumed was horrendous, and I’m pretty sure not fit for human consumption. So supplementation is sometimes necessary, but to think for a second that by taking Hydroxycut, your fat is going to melt away and your Abdominal muscles will miraculously appear is absurd.

 
Get in the gym and do the work, train your mind as well as your body. Trust me it is not mentally easy to motivate yourself to get in the gym day in and day out. Burpees, Squats, Deadlifts, KettleBell, and Pull ups, these things are not always on the top of your ‘I want to do’ list. This mentality will create a disciplined mind that gets stronger every time you exercise it. By making your brain get you into the gym when it can come up with a hundred reasons as to why you should just sit down and watch Dexter or Homeland is not an easy task. Just like working out is not an easy task, but in the same way that your body will improve aesthetically and with more power capacity, so will your mind. As your physique starts to come together, your mind will begin giving you more self-confidence and it will become easier to get into your workout gear and pump some iron.

 
If you were to take the surgery route you bypass this entire step of training the mind. While you may have an external improvement, internally your mind will still be weak. This will cause one of two things - either A. You will desire more surgery because you have not developed this self-confidence. OR B. You will fall back into bad habits because you never developed the mental discipline and it will destroy all of the work the surgery did.

 
We only have one life and one body, it is time to realize that we are worth the investment, and worth the pain and work to get healthy and promote a life of Fitness for our Kids, Friends, and Family.

 
Go log some hours in the gym and don’t look for a shortcut, look for a way to better those around you and get them to the mindset of ‘I am worth the work’.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_17ac6h,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/17ac6h/there_is_no_pfm_pill_so_stop_searching_for_one/,

The idea: when you play you have to finish what you play, no matter how miserably you are about to lose.


some background to explain: the idea came when i played Bejeweled blitz.
its a game of 60 sec and trying to get as many points.
i was trying to reach ""amazing speed""(a point boost from playing fast). if i can't reach in 40 sec ""amazing speed"" than i can't get it in the game, so i restarted the game.
i keep playing the game and i notice that the time it takes me to press the restart button is shortening, at some point i restarted the game after 2 sec because i didn't have the good start i wanted.
And I noticed that after I stopped playing I was more edgy and even couldn't finish reading a short article.
so it made me think if i can't stand the frustration in a 60 sec games how can i stand the frustration of trying to accomplish work\projects done(and in that point i couldn't).


so i kept my old challenge of trying to reach ""amazing speed"" as often as possible and a new challenge, that i told myself has more significance, i have to finish the game and can't stop in the middle.


i couldn't believe how frustrating it will be to not hit the restart button, it became second nature. and in the beginning i failed my promise not to hit restart, but i told myself it's good cause I’m confronting that feeling, and that's something I rarely do.
only when we have to confront how we feel and try to pass that frustrating  feeling/adjust that feeling can we approach more daunting task. 


I've gotten better at not stopping in the middle(in Bejeweled haven't stopped for a couple of months)  and am more able to confront frustration . I still play Bejeweled blitz but a lot less, usually 5 games a day.
one more thing i am able to decided **i will play only 1 or 2 games** and than stop.
that is a big thing for me, cause every time i played i would say last one..and go on playing 10 more.

Since than I decided to find a more challenging game ,a longer one that will have to make me confront bigger frustrations.
I'm trying a game called dominion(based on the cards game).
And it's 1 vs 1 so I hope I will see how it goes.


Now a disclaimer: I still procrastinate, this solution alone is not enough to make a person in to a productivity ninja.
In the beginning the game might consume your time and it will seem like you are moving backward in your goal to be more disciplined, so this is where I hope people can help make the method better, by giving your opinion experience in using it, tips and is this method even any good for other people? 


 My belief is it can help build **FRUSTRATION STAMINA** witch is important in finishing tasks and not giving up in the middle of them.



So I’m going to give some more specifics for those who try it:

1) Decide a game that will be your challenge, just one.

2) First time you try it the game has to be short(60 sec -5 min).
Tetris, Bejeweled, Fruit ninja etc.

3) First time: the game can't be you vs other player but you vs the game, some inner challenge.

4) Better to have more than 1 challenge(some mid game challenge like”amazing speed”).

5) YOU START A GAME, YOU HAVE TO FINISH IT.

6)notice how you feel,when your frustration rises and how you control it.



if you are able to play with out quitting in the middle when you are losing ,there is another level of control you can add and that's deciding how much you will play.

in the beginning try to decide i will play only 1 more game or 2 more. and quit playing even if it will be just 5 min .
my suggestion add this only after you are able to handle you frustration.




**TL;DR**: start playing a game and challenge yourself to finish it no matter how frustrating you feel.




edit: grammar/formatting.

added rule 6 cause it seems the main reason to play wasn't clear enough.

added something i forgot to add about being able to decide how much to play.

I found work doing freelance art for indie games, obviously a good step in the right direction. While this sounds good and I feel very lucky, the matter isn't so simple for me. 

During my time at university and subsequently my first year working at a company, I was exposed to a great deal of inspiring work revolving around social good. Stuff like Khan Academy, KIPP, and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, as well as many smaller things. I fell in love with the idea of using my life to help improve education where I grew up.

During the same period, I realized how much I want to use my body. I am sick and tired of sitting at a desk and staring in to a computer screen all day every day. It seems like 80% of my life is spent staring at a screen. For what? None of it seems to matter. I read about things that reinforce my interests on websites about cool game designers and the work they are doing, but it doesn't feel genuine anymore. I fell in love with games because of the experiences I shared playing them with my brother and friends growing up in college. Now it feels empty, I am alone and striving to make games that will be played alone. The whole reason I loved them in the first place was the shared communal experience and friendship. How fucked up is that?

The thing is, I am incredibly lonely. I keep it all bottled up inside, but my primary social contact is my girlfriend who lives with me. The vast majority of my time is spent sitting on my computer working, and the next most time consuming thing is time wasting internet habits, mostly browsing Reddit and Twitter. My personal life feels completely out of balance. Every day, I long to be part of some sort of group doing interesting work. I long to be with my friends again to share experiences with them, but we are all scattered to the wind. I have returned to my incredible levels of insecurity and shyness that I had at the start of college, and I feel helpless to change my situation even though I know I'm not. If I didn't go for daily walks and coffee breaks, I'd probably lose my mind. I'm crunching on a game I don't really care about, for a life I don't really believe in.

As a fix, I have been seeking tutorship from wherever I can find it. I look up life philosophies from game designers I admire, I read books about work ethic and personal management, I read helpful subs like this one and /Getmotivated and some days, I feel genuinely like I've got it all figured out. Then, I descend in to mental chaos again the next day, feeling like I've received feedback from way to many incidental sources of information. An ideology I picked up in Jiro Dreams of Sushi conflicts with a podcast I listened to, all the while messing with some thoughts I encountered while reading the Steve Job's biography. There is no one to bounce my ideas off of, to test my beliefs with, to share my dreams with.

Whenever I try to talk to my girlfriend or family about it, I feel as though I don't convey the whole truth, or that I can't convey fully how I feel. I feel suffocated, and like I've lost my voice. I need to change this situation, I need to use my body and be with people I love and I need to help the world be a better place than I found it.

For every good, disciplined day I have, It is because I have managed to push back the powerful emotions I'm feeling because of my environment. Other days are complete disasters. And even then, my accomplishments don't seem real. I'm just firing them off in to the digital ether to be liked and @'d on twitter and tumblr.

I need help.

**TLDR** I am in a bad situation. I am trying to overcome my discipline problems while crunching on a game, alone in my apartment.

I make lists and schedules, I try all sorts of techniques from books, I try and set up habits, I try telling myself different things (from ""you must suffer life is suffering so suck it up and enjoy it"" to ""you really love having a neat organised life, you want to do this"").

I mean god I am lazy. Astonishingly lazy. And messy. I have no routine at all. In the morning I get up. Maybe I brush my teeth, IF they feel particularly gross. I get dressed and then I go downstairs for a morning of lazing around on the sofa instead of in bed.

I have a billion things I want to do, practice foreign languages, go for a walk, get out of the freaking house, clean the kitchen, make my partner his food (I do at least do that one because he'd be sad if he had nothing to eat), do the washing up, sweep the floors, apply for jobs etc.

I made a list of daily things to do, lasted 2 days. I made a strict schedule, lasted a few days. These kind of attempts used to last weeks but I seem to have been ground down by repeated failures and now I slide back into ""meh"" so much faster.

I don't know why I can't just keep on top of things. Other women do things like wear makup and have beauty regimes (something I've never done) - I can't even imagine how they have the energy for all that _and_ keeping the house in order, _and_ work, _and_ any personal projects and goals they have for themselves. I don't seem to be able to juggle even one of those things.

One thing I noticed about myself is that I'm awful at keeping on top of things in the summer.

 During the school year (I'm in college), I can go to sleep at an absurd hour, but get up for class the next morning and get over my lack of sleep. I made time every day to eat, to clean, to take a nap, to go to class, to do my homework, to study, to exercise, to work on my business, and be with friends without any problem. 

Here's the situation. It's summer now. I'm moping around and normally, I didn't care that I wasn't being productive because I could sit around and play video games, go get drunk with my friends, or associate with the fellas over at /r/trees, if you get what I'm saying.

However, I'm realizing now, that I don't care about video games, drinking, or smoking. It makes me feel lazy and unproductive. I sold my PS3 and I might play a game on the computer for 15 minutes, but then I'll get bored of it, I cut back on drinking a whole lot, I MIGHT have a couple drinks if my friends are out getting completely shit faced, and I've cut out smoking 100%, 

I want to make more of myself and do things that I want to do to better my life, but I feel like a can't beat this apathy sometimes.  After some consideration, I believe it's down to not having a set schedule.

So what I'm asking all of you at /r/getdisciplined to help put together a schedule for me. What I'm looking for is at this specific time: Wake up. At this specific time until this specific time: Go to the track. Something I noticed that also helps is challenges. Check out the Tony Soprano challenge over at /r/NoFap (Not sure why it's named after him, though)

Things I have to get done during the day and things I want to add:

-Get off of this ridiculous sleep schedule 

-Cleaning the house

-Exercise (I run at my local track and do smaller work outs at my house)

-Do personal development, whether it's through reading or audiobooks.

-Work on my at home business.

-Learn Guitar (I love music so much, I sit in my house and listen to music all day and not care at all. Which is something that has to change)

-Have scheduled times where I eat
 

Some goals I have:

-It's a little difficult to discuss the home business, but if you're interested, we can chat.

-Work my way up to a Marathon (I have found a training for it, I just have to stick with it. I also want to do some other events too in between, 5K's, Spartan Run, Tough Mudder, etc).

I am really good at browsing reddit, reading news, researching stuff and everything in-between, but when it comes to do some actual work, I can't seem to stick at it for longer than 30 minutes.

Another problem which I have is that I take a great interest in something, try to pursue it, and then give it up after while. For example, I might go to the gym for 3 works straight, and go at it well, but then i'll drop off. Or I might really be into cameras, and start to learn stuff about photo editing, but then I’ll leave it altogether and start to learn music production. What happens is that all in all, I’m not well versed in either. This vicious cycle just goes on and on.

What I also find is that once I get into my exam period, I start thinking about all the projects I should be working on, and start putting effort into them, avoiding the important exam work at stake. Then, once my exams are over, the same effort I was putting in before drops off.

It's almost like I'm shicophrenic. I have phases when get lots of stuff done, don't waste time and am generally happier. On the other hand I have phases where I just waste time and get absolutely nothing done. those phases last from a few weeks to few months. It has been that way for at least ten years and I never really know when and why I will shift from one state to the other.

Generally, when I have lots on my plate and lots of stress I get more stuff done on top of that. I just keep working and organise myself efficiently. On the other hand when I have only little to do I generally get nothing, and I mean really nothing, done.

The problem ist: I have no idea what causes the the shifts from one phase to the other. And I can't really remember why I was such a slob when I was. Example: I remeber that I spent the easter weekend lying around in my bed all day long even though there were some minor tasks I wanted to get done. I have however no idea or rather no real memory why I acted that ways and how I felt then. As I said it feels kinda shicophrenic.

The Mind turns to Marble/
The Muscle turns to Steel/
The Blood ROARS/
When wrapped in the scalding arms of Discipline/
I FEEL NO PAIN

Maybe it was something small, like instead of writing that thank you card you have been wanting to, you chose to surf reddit.

I have lupus. It's not in the same league as cancer, but it feels like whenever I get into the swing of my routine (and am really starting to feel good about it all) I have a flare that puts me in bed for three days. That simple break (in the goddam fucking chain - sorry, I know it works wonders for many, I'm happy for you if it works, see below for why I have such a visceral reaction to it) can be enough to reset my routines back to zero. In reality, it's not all the way back to zero (the house doesn't revert to its former mess in three days, I don't lose the stamina/flexibility I've built up either. But I have lost my momentum, and that great feeling I was getting from being disciplined is replaced with crushing disappointment that even my humble goals are often too much for this body of mine.  
I understand that chains work for many of you, don't hate me for my perspective, please (just coming off the biggest flare I've had in months, with pain that stops me sleeping. I'm bawling as I write this, because as well as feeling like a failure on the discipline front I hate that I'm not the active parent I always planned on being). But to see *that* as the top suggestion, repeatedly, for how to get disciplined is hard, hard, hard. I am physically incapable of maintaining that chain, and I have massive mental block over some of my past goals that I was doing really well at, then ""failed"" and have great difficulty getting back into.  
This had turned into a massive wall of text, I apologise. But I have often wondered how many people with difficulties like mine are on this sub. It would be great to hear some advice for getting back on the horse when you've been thrown off.

I've noticed that over the past couple months my energy (and consequently motivation) has reached a baseline level. Months ago when I moved into a new place with a bunch of my best friends and got a new job I had great energy and charisma. I'd wake up every morning and think ""what kind of fun is going to happen today?"" and I'd have fun doing everything, even work. I was driven to go out and take photos, go fishing, and go for hikes every day. I could go up to anyone and have an amazing conversation as well. As I like to put it, I was glowing. I've been like this before that, and I always seem to shrink back to baseline a couple months after achieving a major accomplishment.

I've improved my life greatly in the past few months; I drink less, eat healthier, work out frequently, work on getting better at my hobbies, learned about people skills,  have more responsibilities at my job and found a wonderful girlfriend, but I still don't feel that energy that I used to have. I'm definitely not unhappy, I just don't feel that lucidity that I used to feel. Has anyone experienced this or have any suggestions for changing from baseline to lucid again?

Smart guy can't keep focused on his job for too long at once. Ensuing discussion goes on for pages about ways to improve discipline or otherwise. It's a lot of good well-referenced ideas. By all means, read and identify the best of the best. 

One tiny quote.  I like what skrebbal says here:
You have probably heard it a thousand times from your teachers, parents etc. - ""You could accomplish so MUCH, if just you would STRIVE for it..."" You believe it yourself, talking about your ""full capacity"".
But it's not true. Or at least it's the wrong perspective, allowing for wishful thinking.
The current state you are in - that is your full capacity. More you do not know, because more you have never tried. Or, more drastically: More you do not have, because more you have never proved.
Maybe that's even the reason you are not improving your chore-handling abilities after all (if you allow me this unfounded speculation): You are afraid of hitting your limit (a.k.a. failing) to soon, realizing that you're not that capable after all.
Luckily, there is no such thing as a fixed, inate capacity. Your capacity will definitely improve when you start taking yourself seriously and stop generously sparing yourself the chores.

1372872075.0,11,self.getdisciplined,1hktyd,Measuring your goals...? Join me...,OnlineCourage,12,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1hktyd/measuring_your_goals_join_me/,"I just found this subreddit today while searching for an online support group for people who want to wake up early.  First off, I want to say that I am glad to have found this.

The human race is bound together by the common struggles within our own minds in regards to emotional problems, drugs, eating properly, exercising or other problems.  For me personally, I have had trouble motivating myself to consistently get up early over time - for around 10 years.  

On the other hand, I have had very few problems with keeping myself motivated to exercise for a long time.  Why is this?  I believe that it is because since 2007 I have recorded the number of hours per day that I have exercised on a Google Spreadsheet, along with a short description of what the exercise was.  I have maintained this spreadsheet with a high degree of discipline almost bordering on obsession.  There are some times when I have missed a couple weeks at a time but I am usually able to remember what I did and fill it out.  At the beginning of each year my goal has always been to go for 365 hours of exercise per year.  I have never achieved this goal yet but I have gotten as close as 85% of that goal.  I have seldom been a member of a gym (probably about 10% or less of the time).  I live in Minnesota and so I am out exercising in the coldest days of winter when no one else is out there - extremely cold, harsh temperatures where the clothes around my face are full of ice at the end - no problem.  I have consistently been able to finish in the top 2% of any fun race or athletic event that I have run since 2007, and I am slowly trending upward in performance despite the fact that I am now older (30) and should theoretically be in less shape than in my early 20's.

Because of this, I am a strong believer in the practice of, ""what is measured improves.""  I don't count on my physical performance improving indefinitely of course - but my overall self-discipline and the amount that I have exercised has certainly improved over years prior.  And I would be willing to venture to guess that many of you may benefit from a similar technique.  It's easy to do and you can put together a sheet for free in a few seconds.

Now - what I would like to do next is conquer my inability to get up early.  This is something that I just started tracking on my spreadsheets at the beginning of this year.  I have still not gotten the hang of it.  My original goal was to try to get up at 4AM every week day.  I call this, ""Pulling a Tim Cook,"" (Apple CEO) because that's what time he supposedly gets up.

So anyway - I was able to pull a Tim Cook sporadically over time but never with any consistency worth mentioning.  More recently, I was laid off from my job and now the time that I normally get up has drifted toward 9AM-10AM.  So it's getting pretty bad.  My average for all of the days I have recorded over the year is currently 6:55AM and drifting downward.

What I would like to do, is set up a shared online spreadsheet with multiple users who have the goal of getting up early.  I would like to have a group motivational exercise where we all record the time we get up on a shared Google spreadsheet and maintain that over time.  I will be the leader of this exercise and start the sheet, inviting those who apply and give me 1) a good reason why they are a good candidate to join the spreadsheet 2) reasons why they will stick with the spreadsheet for at least 5 years if not 10 years 3) what their get-up goal is [it does not have to be 4AM, it's more about what works for you and then sticking to that goal] 4) why you think you can reach your goal consistently, as close to 100% as possible, but at least 80% 5) why you can be trusted to fill out your cells honestly with the time that you got up

This spreadsheet will be a dictatorship with me as the controller/leader.  There will be no collaborative system with a board that votes on how it is run.  You can always keep a backup copy of your data on another sheet and start your own sheet.  Why?  Because this is the only way to maintain order and discipline for those who really consider it an important part of their life.  I promise to you that I will maintain the spreadsheet and kick out other members who are not consistently collaborating and updating their wake-up times and are going inactive: that will be the benefit for you to join my spreadsheet - no one will be dragging you down and you can rest assured that it is a serious exercise.

If anyone wants to join, PM me with your application details answering my questions above and I will consider it.  I will start the spreadsheet officially within a week.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1hktyd,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1hktyd/measuring_your_goals_join_me/,

This is ripped directly from my journal.,Mastry,13,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1ec4gn/my_project_today_was_to_get_my_goals_in_order/,"Today, I went to the gym for the first time in quite a while. I thought it would be tough, getting back into it, but today felt very easy. Perhaps I was not pushing myself hard enough. I biked 6.75 miles in 27:15 minutes. I worked up a nice sweat, but did not lose my breath or become overly tired. 

I also received the grades for this semester, two Bs. This means that I am finished with all of the classes I need to be finished with.Yes, I am done with college. I feel overwhelmed with happiness. This was an achievement I sometimes thought I would never complete. I have worked very hard and am proud of my progress.

Today's primary goal is to continue working with the list of goals I created yesterday. I will consolidate similar goals, rate them on how much their completion will improve my life, and then create projects from those goals.


**The initial goal list:**

* Create a video game I'm proud of
* Have success selling a video game
* Have enough money to live comfortably and not worry about the price of food
* Make my father proud of me
* Read at least 4 books a month
* Get fit
* Lose the stomach
* Maintain an exercise schedule
* Hold a job
* Make people happy
* Own a house where I'm far enough away from people to be comfortable
* Maintain a stable body shape
* Have nice clothes
* Able to retire at 40
* Have a job I don't want to retire from
* Get off welfare
* Become a productive person
* Don't live a life of mere existence.


**Consolidated:**

**Work:**

* Create and successfully sell a video game I'm proud of. 
* Make people happy.
* Able to retire at 40, but not want to.

**Mental:**

* Read at least 4 books a month.
* Become a productive person such that I will not live a life of mere existence.

**Physical:**

* Maintain an exercise schedule

**Material:**

* Own a house where I'm far enough away from people to be comfortable.
* Have nice clothes.
* Get off welfare

That's not too bad. Now I will need to rate each goal on how much it will improve my life. I will be using a rating system in which I assign each goal a value from 1 to 9, 1 being very harmful to my life, 5 being neutral, 9 being very helpful to my life.

**Rated:**

**Work:**

* 9 - Create and successfully sell a video game I'm proud of. 
* 7 - Make people happy.
* 7 - Able to retire at 40, but not want to.

**Mental:**

* 8 - Become a productive person such that I will not live a life of mere existence.
* 6 - Read at least 4 books a month.

**Physical:**

* 9 - Maintain an exercise schedule

**Material:**

* 9 - Own a house where I'm far enough away from people to be comfortable.
* 8 - Get off welfare
* 5 - Have nice clothes.


It seems I did a fairly good job picking helpful goals. Because I want to focus on improvement, I will remove ""Have nice clothes"" from the list. I don't think that's particularly necessary. The next step is to turn these goals into projects or activities. I'll want to keep the number of projects to a minimum, and some of the goals that were removed from the list may make another appearance as sub-goals, along with some new goals. These will be used as a metric to monitor my progress, but may not necessarily be things I strongly desire. Speaking of metrics, before we turn these into projects, let's make these goals a little more specific. If I'm going to be measuring my progress, I need to know what I'm measuring to.


**Specified:**

**Work:**

* 9 - Create and successfully sell a video game I'm proud of, earning at least $100,000 from sales. 
* 7 - Make people happy. Get positive feedback from my video game from at least 5 different sources.
* 7 - Able to retire at 40, but not want to.

**Mental:**

* 8 - Become a productive person such that I will not live a life of mere existence. How the hell do I quantify this?
* 6 - Read at least 4 books a month.

**Physical:**

* 9 - Maintain an exercise schedule. Exercise at least 4 times a week.

**Material:**

* 9 - Own a house where I'm far enough away from people to be comfortable to not hear their daily activities. 
* 8 - Get off welfare

That's not perfect, but it's a good start. Now let's turn these goals into projects.

**Projectified:**

**Work:**

* Make a video game

**Mental:**

* Be productive during the hours of 8 am and 4 pm.
* Read

**Physical:**

* Exercise

**Material:**

* Don't spend frivolously.

It seems that to accomplish my goals, I need to do 5 things, and two of them are passive. I actively have to **make a video game**, **read**, and **exercise**. I should be sure to do one of those things **during the hours of 8 am and 4 pm**, and when I earn money, I **don't spend frivolously**. That almost sounds simple. It probably is simple, but it is difficult as well. I have to make a video game I like that sells. That's no easy task.

*/u/TheCourageWolf said that I could post this here along with /r/GetMotivated. So I did. Hopefully I can get more insight and advice this way*
  

 

**TL;DR**: Suffered from mental illness. Recovered within two years. First application to university failed, and perhaps this year, I still won't get into any university pertaining to a program of my interest.
---

----


This is quite long and I'm very sorry about that. I've tried to reduce it and make it as brief as possible. Anyways...

Three years ago, I was diagnosed with OCD, ADHD and was suspected of suffering from some form of bipolar/schizophrenia, but they ruled that out within a few weeks.   
----
My recovery was going well beyond what others expected. With medication and my dedication to improve my life and make up for the last few years that I lost, suffering from mental illness, the psychiatrist decided I would not require any therapy if my progress continued at the rate I was improving.






Prior to this diagnosis (January-March 2012), my marks at high school had dropped to the point where I just managed to graduate with ~50-60's. I understood that there was no (if not any) chance I would be accepted to a university for a degree in either Engineering or Science. University of Toronto was my first choice, followed by Western and Queens (seeing as I live in the GTA).  

For the remainder of the semester my marks had gone from the low 50's to the mid 80's. So I came back to high school for another semester, to increase my marks and also participate in extra-curricular activities and to get a job, increasing my chances of admission and also to do things that I had no motivation to participate in the past.  

This year, my marks had reached the high 80's and low 90's. I had volunteered in a variety of activities outside of school. I also managed to get a job near the end of my semester. This was all before January 2013.  

After that semester, I lived at home, continued to work and volunteer, but also learn new skills and education on my own. In the short time, I've managed to become fluent in French, while still learning Spanish and German. I've started to learn coding, which is going great and I am basically just studying and participating in things that I have interest in.

-------

It's April 2013 now. I applied to Toronto for Engineering along with Western and Queens, (applied for Science as well at both Western and Queens).
----
I had sent a letter regarding the issues I had faced and what my plan was to recover from the illness that affected my marks. This letter was sent to my first time applying in 2012, and again with updated information including most of the information I've written in the little story above.

However, I'm beginning to have concerns that I may not be accepted again. My average (disregarding previous years) is at 88-89%. Given this, I should have a high chance of acceptance, but time is ticking and unless nothing new comes up at the end of April, I'm sure that my chances of acceptance are now slim.

So now I'm confused at what to do now. If I do not receive any acceptances, I don't have any plans on what to do next.

Hell, I'm just having doubts at the moment. For all I know, I could get accepted the minute I submit this thread. However, if it comes down to the worst, I'd like to know what others would advise me to do at this point forward (as a contingency plan). I may also speak to my councelor if I can contact her, but at the moment, looks like I need some comfort and advice from Reddit.

I still want to get into university, but (assuming) I did not get accepted for the second time now. What should my plans be now, since the last thing my parents need is to know that I didn't get accepted again and now if I stay back for a fucking third year, both my and my sister will now be heading off to university at the same time.

So tell me. What should I do from here on out?

At first, they pumped me up so much. I was ready to get shit done. I earnestly played my violin for hours, read, wrote, worked out. I felt myself blossom. Then it would die. I wasn't sure why.


It's happened to me before, so many times. And now I think I understand why. See, to be disciplined, you got to know what you're doing and why – otherwise why is it worth it? How do you guys figure that key part out? I have discipline but don't know where it's worth spending it. I love too many things. I want to play violin professionally (I’m not a freaking prodigy but work my ass off). I want to be a filmmaker (but I've made only 3 short films and could be a lot better). I want to write short stories, a history book, scripts. I want to be a teacher someday in the far-off future.


HOW DO YOU CHOOSE? I’m sick and tired of spreading myself too thin. I've been told I show glimmers of talent wherever I go. My film professor says I have ""the eye."" My violin teacher says I pick up things far more quickly than her other students do, that I get more done in my meager hour of practice a day than they do in their 3 per day. I've been told by my friends I have a way with words especially in poetry. But I'm a history major, and I've always gotten A's on papers and enjoy writing and research. I love these three things (music, film, writing). I come alive in the editing room, glowing with excitement as I piece together stories; I dream about violin-playing and feel my day fulfilled after a hearty practice sesh; I love painting a canvas of words and ideas and other worlds.


The trouble is, knowing what’s right for you depends on exposure/practice. The more I practice violin, the more I’m sure it’s right. If I had a camera and was making stuff 24/7, I’m sure I’d feel more passionate about it too. I’ve considered my core values and tried to match them up with one of these paths, but it seems irrelevant. I just have to choose, but I also am worried about money and success. I do have to fend for myself now after college, and I don’t want to get stuck with something else just for the money. I want to choose one of these paths and make it my life. I think I’d die if I had to give up my violin – I’d be happy being a teacher although I’d want more. A part of me also withers thinking about not making films anymore – it’s been my dream since hs, but I’m not sure if for shallow reasons. Could anyone offer some advice?

Whoever was responsible for coining this phrase was certainly not talking about enacting change.  They may have been talking about a friendship, perhaps a new business venture, but not forcing one’s self to change. There is absolutely nothing beautiful about changing. The process is full of doubt, pitfalls, frustration, and a complete lack of self-esteem. Otherwise, there would be no need to change, now would there?  

We are now two, no, three days into the New Year, and I am working on my goals that were abandoned last year. Paramount is the goal to get into shape. As is par for the course, I have waited until nearly the last minute to work on losing weight, something I have always wanted to do, and now I am stuck in 2013 at only a few pounds shy of 250. At times, I feel as though I am actually stuck in time due to my girth. I know this is a ridiculous notion, but it’s a real one nonetheless.   

Let me just say that Zig Zigler is an exceptionally motivational man. I couldn’t make it halfway through a youtube video about his enacting change lectures without the urge to run away as quickly as possible. So naturally, I went for a run. Now that I am back in my warm and cozy house, I feel miserable. My nose was running like Niagara, my throat throbbing like a mad cock, and now I can’t seem to shake a cough. My legs are shaking, barely sturdy enough to hold my weight as I walk across my house, and upon closer inspection, my head seemed to have adopted the throbbing once seated in my throat. Let me reiterate this, there is nothing even remotely pretty about change.  

However, I suppose that is the point. If change were easy, there would be no reason why the world is as ugly as it is today. We have to have a reason somewhere along the line. Otherwise, we truly are the most pathetic species currently living. Granted, I’m not making a case for humanity here, far from it, but at least there is some comfort (however bleak) in knowing that there is a reason we are all so fat and lazy. I’ve spent the past month or so on a number of sub-reddits looking for answers, motivation, and others that are struggling the same as I am. I have found plenty of the latter two, but the former always was and always will be perspective based. This, too, is par for the course.  

The idea of change is the most beautiful concept ever conceived by mankind. It means that, regardless to any situation or circumstance we may find ourselves in, there is a possibility of change. These possibilities getting harder to reach the further we are from ideal, but the possibility will always be present, even if it is so far away that it seems invisible. That in no way means that the process itself is something worth admiring for its radiant glory. Its often sweaty, obscene, and downright hard to witness.   

So here I sit, still feeling a ten minute run that took place almost an hour ago. I felt as though I would throw up when I finally reached my stopping place, which was not where I initially intended on ending (if not just a small handful of yards away). As I was pacing around my house to cool down from the run, I felt the burn of my sides reach deeper under the panging muscle and set ablaze my hatred for the idea of change. If not for it, I would still be comfortable, sipping on tea or coffee, eating myself into a larger pant size, without care or even notice.   

But alas, here we are, at the New Year with a page full of changes that need to be made. I cannot say that I will ever be happy about the change, but that isn’t the point. I will be happy with the result. My happiness is not in the process, but in the result. That is where we all must look. That is where the beauty truly is.

This is my new motto: 

**NEVER LEAVE ANYTHING TO LUCK.**

* I setup the alarm on my watch AND my cellphone. If one fails, the other will work. And I check that the phone is fully charged.
* Since I have to get up earlier than usual, I prepared my breakfast beforehand for tomorrow, and I'll keep doing it just for this week; because this course is crucial for my professional development. It is a unique opportunity and I don't want it to pass, I don't want to waste time preparing my breakfast in case the trip to the course takes longer than expected.
* Since I live outside the US, I need to check that there will be water and gas services for the month, so I won't have to shower with cold water. Done.
* I have enough spare change for the transport; I went to the bank to withdraw some money and changed a few bills.
* Since I'll possibly have a job interview tomorrow evening, I printed four resumes.
* The resumes are in a waterproof folder. I kept two copies here in case someone steals my briefcase.
* My clothes are also prepared beforehand. In case both alarms fail, I that extra minute is invaluable.

Anyway, why am I sharing all this? Because I'm showing off? No. Because a few years ago, my personal life was a mess, and I had no control over anything, because I left many things to my luck.

It is how people that have done big/important things get it done. No one becomes an awesome, efficient, productive, person overnight. It takes time, and discipline. If you can re-program your brain to do one thing towards your goals until its easy, then you can start doing two things per day - until you become the person you really want to be, and are living the life you want to live. 

I've recently been trying to apply this theory to my life and have found this online goals calendar to be life changing. [Week Plan](https://weekplan.net/) is super easy to use and keeps me focused. If you're not sure what kinds of goals you should be setting, start by making a Personal Constitution that outlines your most basic principles. How do you think the ""right"" way to live is? Will you live to uphold principles like giving and helping others? Making money and having luxury? Finding someone and starting a family? Start with the very basic things that make up your ideal future and work backwards to discover how to achieve those things. Then you can start using WeekPlan to help keep you focused on your tasks that will ultimately lead to your overall goal.

Hope some of you find this helpful. I've been productive for about 3 weeks now using my Personal Constitution and WeekPlan. I don't think I've ever felt better either honestly - I hated feeling like my life was going no where, and that I was stuck at my job and in my current life status. This way of thinking and applying efficiency to my life has really worked for me. I finally have something that I want to be when I grow up and am successfully taking steps to become it!

Most people fail at growing or changing because they expect too much, too soon.

If you want to change something about yourself, or your life, you have to start small.

Choose your practice, whether its 5 minutes of jogging, 10 pushups, or 30 minutes working on your novel. Return to this practice EVERY day.

When I say ""your practice"", I mean it in an almost spiritual sense. Don't act and expect something in return. Just do it, and expect nothing.

Most people start off small, but very quickly add more practices and habits and ideas and dreams, and their ambitions overwhelm their ability to keep pace. And they become discouraged. 

You must understand that, while well intentioned, all of these other, new, exciting things that draw your attention are diluting your ability to focus on your practice. 

This dilution leads to failure, and discouragement. This dilution shows a lack of discipline. It is evidence of our increasingly shallow understanding of how to accomplish what we set out to.

Your ambition, rather than outward in all directions, should be directed into doing your practice as PERFECTLY as you possibly can, honing and refining it every day. 

Once perfected, you move on to the next.

1376401216.0,12,self.getdisciplined,1k9z1i,just do it,humerus,13,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1k9z1i/just_do_it/,"**tl;dr: I’ve been struggling with discipline and self-control for over ten years and I think I’m finally starting to figure out what works for me.**

Just do it.

Heard this before? I have, a lot.  The problem of discipline has been causing me distress for over ten years. In high school I discovered that I just couldn't seem to actually do what I wanted to do (my homework and assignments) and I couldn’t work out how to make myself do it.  I wanted to do well, and I knew I was smart, but I couldn’t sit down and do the work. It was very frustrating for me (as I’m sure many of you will commiserate – the hours sitting staring at a wall, fucking around, watching deadlines edge closer, handing in really crap rushed pieces of work…)


I talked to people a lot about this problem, asking them how they managed to achieve the things I could not. You can sit down and get some work done? You can make yourself get out of bed in the morning? Go for a run? How do you do it? Pretty much invariably, the response would be, 'You just do it!'  You've just got to do it. Just got to make yourself do it. Just, just, just... yeah, but HOW?


I never got a different answer. It started to piss me off. Feeling like the use of the word 'just' insinuated that this was somehow easy or intrinsic.  And I shouldn’t be having a problem doing these things, no one else even needed to think about it! They ‘just did it’!


Like just 'doing it' had never occurred to me? Obviously there is another step in there that some people are missing. I have been hunting what that step is for ten years.  In between waking up, feeling like shit, lying in bed, and the rest of my day.... something happens. Something that causes other people to just get on with it.  But it didn’t happen with me, and so I couldn't get out of bed. I would feel tired and sorry for myself and reset my alarm and skip class and sleep in and lose time. What was the difference? 


These days I think I’ve finally figured it out. ***For me, at least, it is a lot to do with self-esteem and confidence.*** I didn’t believe I could do what I wanted to do, so I essentially sabotaged myself - not really trying, not trying hard enough, not giving things a go... what was the point if I couldn’t anyway? So the thing that happens between wanting to do something, and doing it, is the solid belief that you can actually do it.  But how do you get that?


Well I didn’t find this answer first and apply it with pleasing results.  It happened the other way around.  Over the last ten years my life has gone from really, really shitty to pretty awesome.  And perhaps coincidentally (perhaps not, I don’t know) I started to do better and better in terms of boyfriends, university marks, job opportunities… and now I’m getting out of bed an hour early some mornings to exercise, and in my third year of studying medicine.  Which is incredible for me! 


However I find that as my self esteem improves, so does my self control. I try harder when I feel better about myself. First off, I try at all. Secondly I try again after I fail. Most importantly that magic ‘something’ that goes in between wanting to change and changing; wanting to act and acting actually happens for me now.  Well... more often than before. I’ve got a long way to go! 


So looking back it makes sense for me, and now that I’ve seen that I do actually have a skerrick of control over my life, I have been practicing using this newfound control to do little things about the place.  Washing up most nights before I go to bed, taking out the rubbish, studying a bit at home, and most importantly getting up in the morning to exercise.  I’m a lot more positive about the results these days as well – I don’t expect to be perfect straight away and I know that complete self-discipline is the long term goal that will take lots of practice. 


Anyway, thanks for hearing my story. It might seem obvious to some people, but this little piece of information has taken me a very long time to work out for myself.  The next problem is of course, how to develop self-confidence? Although I am doing that steadily, I have no idea how it’s occurring.  Might be worth thinking about a bit more.

Need guidance on conditioning my body for changing duration of sleep. Till 1 year back, I would do perfectly fine with 6 hour sleep. No dip in Energy levels, no tiredness, no lack of concentration nothing.

Back in december 2012, I had to undergo a small surgery on my umbillicus. Small, required 2 days hospitalization and later on, I had to be taking a little more rest - started sleeping &gt;8 hours almost always. Whenever I tried waking up in six hours, I'd get exhausted by end of the day and end up sleeping extra next day. 

I searched various methods of getting my energy levels up; Started basic body-weight excercies to be in shape and to increase energy levels. It worked! I am more energetic and focused than I used to be even before surgery!!

However, the sleep duration is being a concern. 8 hours a day is a little too much, I would LOVE to reduce this by 2 hours and use them in other productive things I want to do -&gt; Jogs on the day when I dont work out/Play music/Get in touch with friends/Develop new hobbies/Read stuff. 

Can you please suggest any way I could do it? Tried doing the 21 day habit cultivation routine, but I give up in ~5 days, get super exhausted in a week with 6 hour sleep. :(

So, please.. Pretty please, Need some guidance for conditioning my sleep duration!

About the time I left my home country to study abroad.

I used to study well, give everything I had towards what I wanted, was in good shape, exercised at about ~15 hours a week, then I went to college, and I was drowned with responsibilities from living alone, and studies.

And I have not been able to pull myself out of them.

It has been about 1,5 years since I did any sports, and about the same time since I had any sense of accomplishment.

In my beliefs, the root of my problems is the PC.

Internet is good and all, I learn some things, sometimes. (reddit) 
I spend my time on forums, discussing things that might be interesting for the future, interesting for other fields of applications, but have zero implications on my personal life in my future. (tech, accessories, equipment...)
I also use it to communicate with my parents, since they live in another country.

My other problem is games. 
It saddens me to say that I might be addicted to gaming.
And while I now play about 3-4 hours a day, this just makes the Internet&gt;Games&gt;Internet&gt;Games cycle run smoother, without interruptions.

But I too believe games have a positive side. Playing indie puzzles, or games like Portal encourages thinking, while still being fun at the same time.


And that's why I am facing a dilemma. 
Should I quit the internet completely, and stop gaming? 

I believe they both present me with positives, but their negatives might be overwhelming. 
Since Always I had internet, and games, but I knew how to manage my time. Now, I can't!

My longest break from the internet was about 2 weeks (when I moved in to college). A lot less for gaming.

Would you guys encourage me to quit the internet and force myself to follow the right path? Or should I just let it naturally flow? (what if that never happens)

Hello everyone.

I'm taking 15 months off because I just finished my exams and I don't feel now would be the best time to start a study and commit myself to another 4-5 years of something while I have seen so little of the world.

So there it is, 15 months of free time. What would you do if you had that amount of time? I have seen many of you give great advice on how to spend free time and I was wondering if you could give me advice on what to do with such an amount of time.

I've already seen [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1e5ko0/productive_ways_to_fill_the_day/c9x3g6x). 

What I am looking into right now is language courses in foreign countries (I'm Dutch). To be able to pay for these 2-3 month periods I shall be working 3 times a week, leaving 4 days left of 'free time' per week. For example I would be going to Berlin for 2 months to master German, or to Costa Rica for 3 months to learn Spanish. These are great things to do, but I will still be spending most of my time in Holland at home, so I'm looking for advice on that period.


These are some things that I thought would be good to try:

*Work out every day that I don't work (I already do this anyway)

*Learn to cook

*Read (philosofical) books

*Master Lucid Dreaming


**My main goal for these 15 months is to expand my horizon &amp; become a more complete/developed person in all ways so I can feel more comfortable choosing a study for next year.**

A short story I'd like to share with you. In general I call myself disciplined. A full time job, two kids, a course at a university, learning japanese, practice sports 3/4 days a week and some more. Chains.cc helps me to keep track of progress on all, and I recently noticed a trend over large time spans. In the summer months, oktober last year and januari, everything came easy. september, november and februari were more hard, and december/march were definitely subpar. 

What does this mean? I couldn't think of a reason, until I realized I went on a sunny one week holiday in both oktober and beginning of januari. Could it be that the lack of sunshine had an impact on my will power? A simple blood test confirmed that this is the case, since the winter months led to a lack of vitamin D. A vitamin D pill has effectively restored the easy of keeping discipline at the level I want.

TL;DR - if you find maintaining discipline easier in the summer months, check with your docter for a vitamin D deficit.

You start by lifting a 10, 20, or 30.*


Another 7 days have passed since I started this challenge to getting disciplined, changing my bad habits and ultimately becoming healthy and a productivity person. These 7 days went by fast and were very productive. The excitement of making a change and getting healthier fuelled my mind for a week or so. The motivation to doing well was so great that I stayed up 3 nights in a row doing projects, assignments and other work. I would never, in the past, have stayed up a single night to do work (unless it was finals week). The only time I ever stayed up was to browse reddit, youtube subscriptions and/or play video games. Now, I stayed up to do work, which paid off so greatly. Just few days back I received my grade and I ended up scoring a perfect score.


However, then came the weekend, the dreadful and horrible weekend. I planned all my tasks I would have done by the end of the weekend. I noted down any important tasks that definitely should be complete by monday. All guns loaded, I was ready to rock and roll by the time weekend rolled around. Before bed on friday, I put together all my notebooks, notes, papers, pen and anything else I needed to be productive. But then, as I woke up late on saturday morning, I went back to the lazy mind set I had before this challenge. I didn't want to do anything but to lie in bed until 1:00PM. After I finally got out of bed and started my day, it was already ~1:50pm. Then all weekend I avoided work. I didn't touch a single note on my study table. Instead, I cleaned out my room and cleaned around my house and did anything else to avoid real work. The more I tried to push myself towards doing my work, the more I would repel and wanted to doing other useless, unproductive things. That boost I got from starting a challenge was gone. I barely completed a single task all weekend. Most of the weekend was spent watching useless videos and reading useless status and tweets.


Then on Monday, I wrote down my tasks again and went by my day. Slowly, I started getting back in the zone. I started completing work and I started reading a head of class. I pushed myself slowly to keep opening my notebook every time I would close it. Even though it’s still not the same as last week, it is better than before I started this challenge. The problem is that when we try to become disciplined or just motivated to do better. We get that rush at first and we do a lot of work and get a lot of stuff done. But then it all runs out and your back to the same person you were before. I think we push ourselves too much the first week and then just want to do nothing the next week. 


Again, as many redditors and bloggers mention, discipline isn’t a switch in your head that you turned off years ago and can simply flip it back on. We become lazy by doing the same unproductive things over and over, we make a habit out of unproductive things. And in order to get disciplined we have to start small and every small step counts. Before this I would never make my bed when I woke up, now that’s the first thing I do even if I wake up late.

[Post from last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1apuld/post_1_my_road_to_getting_disciplined_and_to/)

**TIP 2: Small steps make big changes!**

Before this challenge when I was trying so hard to get disciplined. I pushed myself way too hard for a day or two and then gave up because I would get exhausted and didn't want to put up with it. I even made task lists before but they would just roll around in my bag and be forever forgotten in time. Last week, when i was doing my assignment. I didn't start off saying ""okay let's finish this WHOLE assignment in one go."" instead i said, ""Okay, i'm going to do the introduction then 15 minute break. Then do ..."" The funny thing is that when i finished the introduction, I took like a 5 minute break and went back to work. It was actually an interesting topic that i kept going on to the next part. You should also try doing this. It works with any task or goal. Start with a small step.


*Don't look at the task as a whole, look at it as parts that fit together to make the whole thing.*


* Start by breaking down the work you want to do. If you can do the task next week but want to get a head start then start by doing half of the task today.
* Your gonna get demotivated and get lazy but when you feel like you are doing something your not suppose to, simply turn off the screen stand up and walk outside for 5 minutes.
* Keep pushing even if you think your not making progress. Every little bit counts towards the big reward.
* Take breaks frequently and keep working towards your goals.
* Lastly, don't expect to master productivity and being able to do things over night. It will take practice and a lot of hard work. 


**Failure is inevitable, giving up is an option.**


Well this has been ~14 days for me. I am motivated to keep going and keep learning from fellow redditors and other bloggers on the internet. Still got tons to learn. Now my goal is to come up with a basic everyday routine and weekly routine. I want to start working out, meditating, start running, get disciplined mentally and physically. Also I'm not sure if there is a better subreddit for writing progress report on getting disciplined, motivated, working hard, improving life, productive habits so on... If so, let me know I can make Post 3 there, if not i'll just keep it here :)

1361219891.0,10,self.getdisciplined,18rs32,Turning my Life around - Habit change project,TheMul,16,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/18rs32/turning_my_life_around_habit_change_project/,"I have been contemplating starting this project for too long now. I am sick of where my life is at and where I am going. I have the power to control the kind of future I will have and I am determined to change.


I will start off by describing how my life is now and will then outline what I am going to do.


I am a 22 year old computer science student, and probably one of the worst procrastinators you will ever meet. My procrastination habits seem to be getting worse as the years go by. Last semester I left several assignments to the last week and was forced to complete a 7000 word essay and a 5000 word report from start to finish in a 2 day caffeine fueled frenzy without any sleep. My procrastination just doesn't affect my studies I leave just about everything to the last possible minute. as a result I am always stressed and always rushing.


Sleeping in is another bad habit I have, I can easily stay up to 7 am in the morning and sleep to 3/4 pm during the holidays or weekends. Its even started happening during the week and I have missed many classes as a result. When my days don't usually start to late afternoon I find it hard to be productive.


Yet another bad habit I have is smoking, I have been a smoker since I was 15. I have wasted an uncountable fortune and have been ruining my health with nicotine all these years and actually detest cigarettes now, The only reason I smoke is because I am addicted and I aim to break this.


Finally I am a bit chubby, I am not obese or overly fat but if I don't change my eating habits (junk food) and my exercise habits (does walking to uni count?) its only a matter of time before I do become really fat. I have always had a bit of a belly so a stomach like a washboard would be a nice change.


Now that I have described my present situation this is how I am going to get out of it and change my life:


I am going to change 6 habits over the next 4 months And I will track my progress by posting weekly updates on the respective subreddits most relevant to the current habit I am changing.  Below is the list of habits I will change and the subreddit I will use to provide updates on.


1. Getting up at 7 am every morning           - [/r/GetOutOfBed](http://tk.reddit.com/r/GetOutOfBed/)
2. Stop procrastinating                            - [/r/Productivity](http://tk.reddit.com/r/productivity/)
3. Stopping smoking                                - [/r/StopSmoking](http://tk.reddit.com/r/StopSmoking)
4. Implementing GTD into my Life               -[/r/Productivity](http://tk.reddit.com/r/productivity/)
5. Exercising everyday                             -[/r/Fitness](http://tk.reddit.com/r/Fitness)
6. Eating a more balanced and healthy diet  -[/r/Fitness](http://tk.reddit.com/r/Fitness)


I will spend 30 days conditioning each habit except the Procrastination habit which will take about 6 weeks. The reason I am using different subreddits to update my progress on each habit is because the readers there will most likely be going through something similar and will be able to hopefully offer better advice and feedback. The numbers in the list above are the order in which I will start each habit change. To begin I am going to tackle the sleeping and procrastination habits at the same time and that starts today!.


Sorry for the really long post, any feedback or wisdom you guys can give me to approach this project will be much appreciated. I wont be giving up and I am committing to see this through to the very end.


**tldr;** I will be changing 6 habits over the next 4 months and will be providing weekly updates on my progress using the subreddits listed above.

**Edit**
These posts outline exactly what I am going to do for my first two habit changes:

I just feel a lot more calm when I'm sitting here writing this at home, than I would tell this to somebody. Not to mention my communication skills are terrible (when I misspell something my heart's bpm raises to 9001 bpm. People fail to understand me quite often, too -  getting quite nervous there too). I also say a lot of stupid things I later regret saying - I control that to some degree now. I think it would occur less frequently if I were more calm.

How do I get calm in situations like these?

On a side note, I've built a self-improvement program - it's something somebody probably already invented, but I'll post it anyway.

Split yourself into 2 parts: mental and physical.

Mental is what you think about - generally: a result of thought. Example: Talking.

Physical is your body - what your body limits you with, but not necessarily. For example: keeping good posture is rather physical, but has it's fundamentals in mentality.

Pick one thing you want to change in either of these zones, then fulfill them. One thing: addictions count as two, and are top priority.

I know I don't really tell you HOW to get disciplined, but it gets you organized, doesn't it?


EDIT: Woah, what? It's always like that if I tell Reddit about my minor problems regarding communication with people it always turns out I'm some outcast down from The Secret Club itself. I don't really have any problems with going out anywhere, I just feel that tiny bit of nervousness every time I'm not at home. Well, yeah, I sometimes get nervous at the mall like ""Shit, does this store sell women's clothes only?"" or ""Goddamit, are these pants over there for men or women?

""But the virtues we get by first exercising them, as also happens in the case of the arts as well. For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them, e.g., men become builders by building and lyre players by playing the lyre; so too we become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.

""It is bad when one thing becomes two. One should not look
for anything else in the Way of the Samurai. It is the same
for anything that is called a Way... If one
understands things in this manner, he should be able to hear
about all Ways and be more and more in accord with his own.""
 - Yamamoto Tsunetomo (Hagakure)

Also from Hagakure

""Although it stands to reason that a samurai should be mindful of the Way of the Samurai, it would seem that we are all negligent. Consequently, if someone were to ask 'What is the true meaning of the Way of the Samurai?' the person who would be able to answer promptly is rare. **This is because it has not been established in one's mind beforehand.** From this, one's unmindfulness of the Way can be known.

1347318961.0,9,self.getdisciplined,zofn8,What I'm doing to get in better shape (x-post from howtonotgiveafuck I was told you guys might appreciate it as well),Stanrock,11,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/zofn8/what_im_doing_to_get_in_better_shape_xpost_from/,"I’m going to start with the obvious yet not so obvious.  The best thing you can do for yourself is simply being active. Physically active. Physical activity releases endorphins into your brain meats. Endorphins make you happy and, as a result, take away any fucks you had left to give.  This is temporary, of course. “What’s the solution to this being temporary?” You may be thinking. I’ll tell you. Don’t stop. That leads me to where I am now.

I have recently started a process that I’m calling “mathing.” If you’ve ever seen Adventure Time then you know that they use math as a synonym for awesome or cool. The point is to make yourself more awesome today than you were yesterday. Step one, buy yourself a few composition notebooks, or if you want to be really fancy, a few little leather bound notebooks. One of these is your “physical activity” journal. In this journal you will write down every physical activity that you do. Jogging, push ups, pull ups, sit ups, racquetball, practicing a martial art, anything that could be considered exercise. This should start to feel like a “reward.” Keep this book at hand. I keep mine at my computer desk, because that’s where I waste the most time. Now, every time I see it I think that I could be writing in it, which is a little reward for me, and then I do some push ups or pull ups or whatever. New entry, new happiness.  

Another important part of this is to set goals! Start your first week with doing a few sets here and there, maybe as a break from studying, redditing, jerking off, or whatever it is that you do with your life. Record the number in each set and the number of sets, as well as the specific type of exercise. (e.g. push ups: standard push ups 1 of 25, 1 of 20, wide push ups 1 of 25, close push ups 1 of 25) Note: you are going to want to make some short hand notation.  Once you’ve done a week go through and total up your exercises. I count different types of an exercise all as the same exercise, i.e. the above example would just be 95 push ups. Here is the fun part: Look back on the week, do you think you could have done more? Add 50 – 200 to next week’s goal. Do you think you couldn’t have realistically done more but after this week you probably can? Add 25 – 100 to next week’s goal. Make your goals realistic! I can’t stress this part enough. That’s the entire point of the first week without a goal, to see where you are because the whole point of this is to make you a better you. Don’t compare to anyone else! You are doing this to make you better. If you did better today than you did yesterday, then you are a better you. That is a triumph!

Optional: I started with just a push ups goal, then I had a push ups and pull ups goal. I’m going to keep adding a goal for a workout every week. Also, I try to evenly spread my workouts between close grip, wide grip, and standard, or hybrid, grip so as to have an even spread of gains. 

Your other notebook is your food journal. Write down EVERYTHING that you eat and drink (aside from water) in the best measurements you can. You’ll notice that once you’ve written in a meal and you are thinking about going back for seconds, even though you’re not really hungry, knowing that you’d have to modify your original entry will be a punishment. Incentive to NOT eat more than you need to. (don’t let this make you eat too little.) IMPORTANT: If you’re adding a portion to a meal you’ve already written then you have to cross out whatever measurement you originally put and replace it with the new measurement, not only do you have to put that you ate more food, you have to cross out the healthy portion to replace it with an unhealthy portion, this is where the punishment comes in. This one is best kept as the little leather bound notebook as they are easier to carry around. Keep it with you at all times! Try to eat a bit healthier every day. I know I sure as hell don’t want to see “Taco Bell” written in my food journal.

Now you are healthier and happier and less able to give fucks. Congratulations!

Optional: I have several other goals that I’m setting, aside from physical activity. I want to get accepted to grad school, get another rank promotion in tae kwon do, beat my roommate at racquetball, relearn C, and teach myself basic Topology. I will keep as much of this stuff recorded as I can. I may also start recording my study time.

Can anyone help me with the doubt? Am I the only here who has this ?  How am i supposed to deal with that?

In those 2-3 hours I usually eat, drink tea, and listen to music or just plain do nothing/surf reddit. After those 2-3 hours pass I get a marginal boost in energy and become productive in what I want to do, learn.

The problem is that I practically slog through my learning. I accomplish it, but often at a slow pace and if I had more energy would have completed various lessons sooner so I could keep learning. Some days I have a large burst of energy and become amazing at getting things done due to it, but this lasts for an hour or so and then I slip into a lagging pace of accomplishment.

**A detail of my day**

-Wake up at 5:30 A.M, eat a good breakfast, make a gallon of tea for the family, and relax for 20 minutes prior to leaving the house at 6:40 to head out for school.

**School breakdown:**

Pre-Calculus Honors

Physics for 80 minutes due to lab

Orchestra

Health(joke class)

AP US History

AP Language

AP Chemistry for 80 minutes due to lab

No free time in school except twice a week.

**At home:**

-Eat good pre-dinner at 2:15PM (I eat lunch in a class)

-Relax 2-3 hours or do homework right away cutting down on relaxation time.

-Learn until 8PM.
     -This consists of various online college courses, piano, lots of reading on topics like history, business, economics, math, etc..., programming, learn German and anything else I can fit in.

-Work out (90+ push-ups at once, 20+ hand-stand push-ups, jog etc...) for approx 30 minutes and then I shower.

-Read fiction novel of choice for 1-2 hours.

-Meditate prior to sleeping

-Overall sleep time = 6-8 hours



**To note:** 

I don't have procrastination issues (homework, if possible, is done 1-2 weeks ahead of time over weekends)

I've slowly recovered from a year-long depression (almost ended in suicide if that's of relevance) a few months back and I currently emotionally feel the best I've been in a very long time, but perhaps I still have lingering issues that I haven't identified due to my past.

No weight issues, self-esteem issues, or any of that.

****
I just lack some energy and focus as result of said lack and wondered if anyone had any tips to overcome this hurdle.

A possible hypothesis of mine is that I completely lose momentum in some way.

Any advice would be welcome and I thank each and every one of you in advance.

I want to live up to my full potential and be all that I can be, but with temptation and delaying things lurking around every corner, I find it hard to change.  

Last week I promised myself that I would start eating healthier, which I have been doing on and off for a while now.  I held it down for a week.  Unfortunately, I had to go from college to my house to pick up some items, which lead to me staying the weekend and visiting with family.  I was doing so well and feeling great before I went home.  I just started eating kind of whatever the night I came back when I was fixing dinner, and afterwards, I felt guilty, so guilty.

My parents are loving and caring people, but they don't understand what I'm going through even though I have told them about my plan.  My mom tells me to keep up the exercise and try to stay fit, but 30 seconds later she is pulling out brownies that she said she made just for me.......

You've got to be kidding me, mom....

Then we have my dad who is a health nut, but he's an enabler.  He secretly buys all of the junk food and tells us he got it just for us because he knows we aren't the cave-dwelling neck-beards who are borderline health problem status(no offense to those of you that are, but I doubt there are any on here ;) ).  

I felt kinda ""blah"" the next day so I said ""whatever"" and just ate whatever was easiest to make.  Come monday I'm back on the grind.  Back at school and feeling better with the gym time I'm putting in and the food that I'm eating.

**Here is my problem-  I'm a huge Ravens fan and I'm going home to watch the SB with my family.  I'm pretty sure we won't be doing anything fancy, although it is the SB and it comes once a year.  Plus it's the Ravens!  I feel like if I don't stay to the way I've been eating, then I'll find an excuse to skip on my diet and completely lose out on everything I've worked for.  I don't know what to do and would like some opinions, because I know that the support from this sub is pretty high up there.  I'd say it's pretty close to /r/loseit to be honest.**

This past year has been pretty crazy for me too, and I have a lot riding on this change.  My only grandfather (Pop pop) died.  We were close.  I broke up with my girlfriend of 2.5 years, because she was sucking the life out of me(emotionally, mentally, and physically), only to be hit like a truck by how I actually felt about her after we had broke up and how 2 weeks later she was in a relationship with a stronger and older guy who she met through me.  I took her for granted and I won't make that mistake again. My parents are going through some tough times financially and I'm trying help out.

Elliott introduces the idea of doing just two things everyday, no matter what: walking and drinking water. He says that these two things act as a ""heartbeat"" for the person you are trying to be. These two things, when done every day, will become second nature.

I originally created the app for my own needs, because I wanted something like it but couldn't find anything existing. It's a one man operation; I do everything by myself.

Well, back to the codes:

You can redeem them in iTunes by scrolling to the bottom of the iTunes Store view and clicking the ""redeem"" link. If you use a code, please reply which one so I'll remove it.

- Execution.  What things can you do to help you carry out your plan daily? 

---------

**RPM Method**

Need to add how you will measure your results and also measure how well you are carrying out your plan.

For example if you a learning a skill, the measurement will be 'How many minutes/hours have you spent on practicing this week?'

For weight loss you can measure your weight (measuring the result) but you can also measure your exercise and diet (energy expenditure and energy intake).


**Result**

- What result do you want?  Be as specific as possible.

**Plan**

- What is your daily/weekly plan for getting this result?

Losing weight: do exercise X 30 minutes every day, take in X calories per day

Study: 1 hour self study on weekdays, 2 hours group study on saturday

- Do you have a plan that someone else has followed and obtained the result you want?

Losing weight: couch to 5k, other plans in /r/fitness

Study: one mentioned above or something in /r/getstudying

- Make it a positive, not a negative.

I would suggest framing your second result in positive terms. Instead of writing ""stop hitting the snooze button"" write ""I will get out of bed as soon as my alarm goes off""

**Motivators**

- Extrinsic motivators: Why do you want this result?

Losing weight: increased confidence, increased health, attract mates, positive attention, increased stamina.

Study: increased knowledge, increased career prospects, increase scholarship chances.

- Intrinsic motivators: What do you enjoy about the task itself?

For losing weight, this would be enjoying the particular physical activity you enjoy to expend your energy.  i.e. you enjoy swimming so you spend your energy this way.

For study, this would be finding a pleasant study environment, enjoying the reading, enjoying thinking through problems and content you are study.  The process of writing out notes by hand, or maybe even enjoying group study with classmates.

**Measurement**

- How will you measure your result?

For losing weight this would be measuring your weight and tracking it.
For study this would be your exam mark.

- How will you measure your performance?

For losing weight this would be measuring your caloric intake and expenditure through exercise.

For study this would be the number of hours you have studied this week.

[The post](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/zhgbt/get_disciplined_not_motivated/) found great resonance in the GetMotivated community and soon enough someone complained that [there is no subreddit called /r/GetDisciplined](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/zhgbt/get_disciplined_not_motivated/c64qjrv) whereas /u/TheGreatestZenMaster responsibly took care of the duty to satisfy the thirst of the people.

Seeing this subreddit explode and having more than 50,000 subscribers is simply amazing and a testament to the importance of discipline in everyones life. I just found out about you guys because I started to ""slack"" hard in the last couple of months and really need to change.

This is my first step to regain and maintain self-discipline and I hope the Text by Joel Runyon inspires you as much as it did inspire me.

However, I don't find I have the focus to stick with things.

I always need to be doing something to improve. Whether it's self improvement in health, wealth, or relationships...I'm always working towards something.

I will get very very into something for awhile, and then something else will come up and I'll drop that for something else.

I started to think of completing things as a 'muscle'. You don't go to the gym and bench 300 your first time. You just make a goal to consistently go to the gym, do more and learn more than the last time, and stick with it. Eventually you reach 300.

So, to exercise my motivation/focus muscle I started setting little and big goals for the 6 months. Small things like to floss or make the bed everyday no matter what, and bigger things like running or working out everyday. I've done these things for the past 6 months.

However, when it comes to furthering my career or upping my income through side projects, I seem to move from one thing to another quite often. I never stop learning about something, but I can't seem to stay focused on one thing for very long. A new thing pops up and I move to it. I may go from hardcore learning about iOS development for weeks everyday, and then all of a sudden real estate peaks my interest, and iOS goes to the wayside and I start looking into real estate non stop. I learn quite a bit, but then another idea comes to me to use my savings to get a loan and open a business with my significant other.

Does anyone else have this issue? Anyone else find their focus is not laser like when it comes to one thing, but jumps all over the map? I'm motivated to do SOMETHING all the time, but that SOMETHING always changes. It's like I have some sort of Hyperfocus ADHD.

-friend who I live with, his dad is selling the house we're in. In a few months, my ideal living situation I am currently in will be gone. Roommate is being evasive so I can't count on him, which means I need to find a place to live within my very meager budget.

-I'm going to school full time, and need to be working nearly full time as well. I should be able to make that work, however a full school schedule along with at least 30 hours of work each week is more than a little intimidating.

-my car is not exactly good. It's slowly falling apart, and will hopefully last thru at least a year. The money I'm making now isn't enough to get by considering I pay my own health insurance, how the hell am I going to survive on my own if I'm scraping by now?

-I'm attempting to also include time for more fitness and healthier eating which kicks into s very tight schedule and my crappy money situation. 

Right now, I'm not really looking for motivation because I have that.

Usually I find a reason to leave and skip out, but I'm not letting myself do it this time. That is giving me severe, overpowering anxiety. I can't sleep at nights sometimes.

Currently, I go to school full-time (suggested study hours equates to about 56 hours per week), work full-time for a financial firm about 50 hours per week, I work part-time for my father, and I do other miscellaneous jobs throughout the week. This is a big burden for anybody and it leaves little time for social life, but I am able to keep my grades high and I have become extraordinarily productive. Here are some tips that I use throughout my day/ week

* Sunday Funday: Sundays are the most important day of the week hands down. This is where you get all of your homework laid out for the week, organize your schedule to allot study times, and overall just introduce yourself to the week ahead. I normally try, especially with school, to spend one Sunday setting up every week's worth of homework for all of my classes so I don't have to scramble. Plus, this allows Sunday to give me a head start on my school work to ease my workload during the week...This pays off. Sundays are also when I do my cooking for the week, making PB &amp; J's and freezing them, etc.. Anything to make my week easier I do it.

* Lists, Lists, Lists:  I make my weekly lists for each class on Sunday, but I also do a daily list the night before each upcoming day. This includes homework, meetings, and anything else. I use an outline format and my co-workers often notice that I am constantly making outlines which helps me to avoid missing any small details. Now, I have read many articles about being productive and how to keep yourself from being overwhelmed, lists are key to this and there should be a way you can use them to keep yourself from staring at it like ""holy fuck"". Make 1 list in its entirety of everything you have to do. Then, you can use small pieces of paper and put each individual item on the piece of paper and put them in the order they must get done. This gives you a couple advantages, 1) you are only looking at one item at a time, 2) you are able to add notes to each item which helps you remember past thoughts and create more ideas for it, 3) you feel accomplished with each piece of paper you throw away.

* Motivation: Probably the hardest part for me as well as many others. It's just kind of self-help for the first 3 weeks, just get up and fucking do it. Stop laying around, stop being lazy, and start being productive. Straight up. Yeah, all of my friends are partying or having so much fun, but I am doing something better, I am doing something that is going to help me for the rest of my life and can only help me and never hurt me. Just look it at like that. There is plenty of time for fun, but that comes later. I'm learning that as I go along and have been learning that since I was younger when my dad wouldn't let me take off of work on my birthday, now I expect to work everyday and holidays because it has become engraved. 

* I'm borderline OCD, I'm very organized and whenever I do have people over they often comment on how clean and neat everything is. I pride myself on the ability to get things done and getting them done right. The first time. I also learn along the way like everyone else, and I have my own way of doing things..like everyone else. I've learned to recognize how to get things done like expediting how long it takes to clean my apartment by doing certain things during the week that make it easier. I'm open for questions or suggestions of your own. I'm still learning and I will be for the rest of my life, but I'm getting better and more efficient and it feels fantastic.

And also, I seem to be just weak in midday, I don't have that burst of energy. I don't know why.

And so, I devised a new plan, yet to be adapted to. 

1. Wake up at about 12PM + and eat brunch
2. Do work, or anything productive
3. Nap before getting ready for class at 6PM
4. Come home at 9PM, chillax a bit, sleep at around 10PM, wake up at 1AM

I am one of those people that have a tendency to want to learn and do everything available in the world that is exciting. If I discover some new hobby, I get excited, and spend the next 3-4 weeks learning, practicing, etc while dropping my other priorities.

* Exercise
* Studying French
 * Operate a side business

These activities will never end. I always need to exercise. If I want to stay proficient in French, I’ll need to always practice, etc. My problem is I also want to do item X, Y, Z on my list but I’m trying to stay disciplined and not overburden myself. I would like to sooner or later learn/accomplish other things in life.

I want to know if other people have this problem. How do you decide “Well… I’m done with X, time to start Y” when X is something like “Learning Spanish”?? Or do I need to accept the butt-ugly truth that I’ll need to sacrifice time spent in X in order to do Y?

I'm worried that when I graduate, I won't actually be able to succeed in this dream. 

I come from a very poor family, so I can't go to anyone for capital to start my business; I have to pull a business loan or find an investor. So if I want to avoid filing for bankruptcy, I better be able to turn that business into a success. But what if I don't? What if the business fails?

I see all over this reddit (and everywhere else, for that matter) that when one fails, the best course is to get up and try again. What if that's not an option? What if you only get one chance to do the thing you dream of doing? If my business fails, I'll be broke, in debt to a bank, and farther behind than if I had never tried in the first place. 

Just 'start again' doesn't adequately address my concerns here. No bank is going to loan me a second business loan if I tank the first one. If the business fails, I have absolutely no idea what to do. I accept the fact that even if I do everything well and plan for as much as I can, things outside my control can cause this dream to fall apart. 

I've gone to friends and family about this, but I only ever get in return is some variation on the theme of 'Well, you fail %100 of the things you don't try', which is a nice platitude, but doesn't actually provide any helpful answers.

Is my childhood poverty overwhelming my perspective here? How does one rise from the ashes of a failed business? I know I haven't failed yet, but if I can't find some semblage of an answer to this, I'm afraid i'll never risk it at all. 

Any advice?

I guess it is because I made that decision when I was still immature enough to know what I really wanted, or maybe I knew but in a very blurry way.

Maybe it was blurry because of fear, having a sense of purpose… Fear created by not understanding my surroundings better and lacking a sense of direction and purpose by not understanding myself.

Thanks to books, my economics degree, observing people, having conversations with them gave me an idea of the world around me.

And spending time patiently analyzing myself, even if it would steal time form my studies got me to understand my impulses, desires, what moves me and where it is coming from.

I still have much to learn and only beginning to see the tip of the iceberg. But I feel I am in a better position to decide upon something I had to do 4 years ago. But life is funny that way. 

I am sure this is a normal case and happens to a lot of people. And like in my case, even if the causes are complicated and tangled up, I believe it always boils down to circumstances and oneself.

No mystery there. The problem is getting form where you are to where you want to be, or who you are and who you want to become.

Well it is more of a challenge than a problem. A problem would be still where you are, not filling fulfilled, and not doing anything about it. Just wondering in circles.

So how to connect the dots when they seem far and there are other dots nearby but have to draw from your dot due to responsibility and commitment?

My degree IS helping me understand an important perspective of the world as I mentioned earlier and understanding my surroundings is part of my goal in life, since I believe that is important to be happy. But I can’t help wonder how the other perspectives look like. I feel to impatient a lot of times which leads me distracted from my planned day. And it is more critical during finals week(s).

I guess this happens to a lot of people. How do you guys connect the dots when this happens?

I teach two classes fright now, an Honors 9 class and Pre-AP 10 class. I also am taking two classes at my university and am applying for jobs in local school districts. 

The biggest area I’m struggling in is that as a teacher, there is always work I could be doing. It feels endless and it’s hard to get motivated to start because I feel like I so rarely experience any sense of completion. There is always a stack of papers to grade, always lessons I could be planning. I never feel like I’m DONE with anything. Even if I’m caught up on grading and have lessons planned for the next day, I could be doing more.  I don’t want to start because it feels like I’m never actually done. The other night I sat down and worked for two hours on plans for the next day and graded an assignment. I easily could have worked for four. 

Working ahead doesn't always work either. If my students struggled with something, I need to plan on re-teaching or reviewing and I can’t predict when they will have a hard time understanding something. 
What tends to happen is that on Fridays I’m so beat that I take until Sunday to recover and then I have to work extra hard throughout the week to keep up. 

Any help on this? I do get work done, but it’s not always at the quality that I want  and I often put it off because I anticipate that I’m going to feel just as stressed when I finish about all the work that I didn’t do.

I'm currently studying in a pre university course, my high school grades aren't enough for me to enroll to university and start studying the one thing I want. In this pre course I'm studying high school physics and advanced high school math with pre calculus and all that. 
(I started this pre course after three years of army and two years of jobs and fooling around, with no studies of anything in those years.)
I started this course and I didn't really thought how I should organize for myself or if I need to at all. 
Because of the subjects being studied, homework is important. I was naive enough to think I would succeed in making ALL of the homework, it punched me in the face pretty good, talking to people I realized no one does all of it, everyone does bits and chosen exercises.
After I tried making it all and didn't succeed I started to procrastinate on it. Then I've read about organizing myself, on reddit and a book too. But that didn't work, looking at it now I just don't give a shit, I do some of my homework, on which the homework done and time ratio is enormous, and too add to all that I'm being drafted to army once in a while for a week worth of training.
Needless to say the whole situation makes me wanna beat myself, but from the other side I just don't care.
I am trying to get back to self discipline I had after army, when I couldn't sit for ten minutes without doing something. For now I just arranged my sleep routine 2200 to 0600.

The days that are lost, so is the portion of my mind associated with the project. Its not simply a decision to laze and not do the work, but rather, forgetting it altogether. Forgetting the project exists. Any stray thought associated with it seems to bounce off an invisible barrier and when the barrier disappears, its oft the dead of night. Perhaps the day after is different, I think then, and occasionally it is.

I get no enjoyment out of it except being able to ignore reality + ignore how much I've wasted my potential. I can't get off of it though because I hate myself and probably get something out of feeling superior to all the stupidity posted here. Please help (post is so long because I'm ranting about what a loser I am, sorry)

I've been using this website for a little over a year, and I truly hate it. The overused sayings and memes, the type of people who make up the majority of the site, the self righteousness, the repetition of it all, everything. 

Yet I swear I spend 80% of my waking hours on this website. I'm a student yet I barely go to class, don't have friends, don't have a job, don't even leave my dorm except to get food. But I don't know why I choose to live like this. I'll go to class for the first ~third of a semester and ace every test and assignment, then think fuck it I can do this in my sleep and stop going to class. Then I'll miss a test or not turn in a project or something because I didn't do something as simple as caring enough to write down a goddamn due date. Then I just give up because I know I'm *fucked* regardless of what I do because I just ruined my chances of getting good grades. I *had* friends but don't have the wherewithall to keep up friendships for more than a few weeks with anyone who I don't see as being a pretty perfect example of a human being.

I pity myself and but at the same time think I'm better than everyone and that I could own the fucking world if I just tried. (just like everyone says on Reddit. but it's different for *me*! /s) I know, I'm a lazy, hypocritical bag of shit. I say I hate Reddit yet I act like a stereotypical ""neckbeard"" and spend all my time on it. I think the real problem is that I hate myself. I really am naturally talented in many ways and can see so much potential in myself in a lot of different things but I'm too much of a piece of shit to do anything with it. I'm really not even socially awkward either, and I'm attractive to boot.

 My only friend is my girlfriend (1 year younger, lives 3 hours away + in high school) who is extremely hot and cool but I'm not sure if I really love her or if I'm just hanging on to that relationship because I don't want to be completely alone. And she visits me every 3 weeks and it's my only real human interaction plus we have tons of great sex. She doesn't know the extent of my loserness because she doesn't know how I spend my average day. In fact she is sometimes insecure that she'll lose me to some college girl which is ridiculous because I don't even have any female friends here! It's not that I've ever been rejected or have failed to make friends, I just never tried. I have plenty of dorm acquaintances who like me and I will sometimes hang out with but I never make real friendships. [Occasionally they'll say things like, 'man I never see you around anymore, you must be a busy guy!' they probably think I'm just aloof and not riddled with self hatred and anxiety sitting in my room]. It's like I don't think I'm actually a member of the human species and being normal just isn't an option for me. I just don't see the point of it all. 

I think I'm depressed or even bi-polar but who really knows I might just be a moody loser. (this post is very negative and self-hating because that's how I feel right now, but I know in a few days or a week I'll be on top of the world about myself. It always happens). I also ""have"" ADHD-I (non-hyperactive, diagnosed twice at age 18), but I'm not even sure that I believe it's a real thing. I realize that I'm a posterboy for ADD and that it explains a lot of my issues, but most of the time I think it's a bullshit ""disorder"" and more of an excuse for why I'm just being a piece of shit who needs amphetamines to get anything done. And I don't know what to do.

Just wanted to make a note of that in case any of the prose is stilted.)

I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. I mean that in a lot of ways. I don’t know what I want to do (I’m a university student and I haven’t declared my major). I don’t know how to best do the things I enjoy doing (writing fiction). And – most importantly – I don’t know what I do with my day.

I'm going to monitor time spent on the internet, time spent watching TV, time spent doing productive work, amount of sleep, (possibly) amount of exercise, and (possibly) diet. I’ll use this information to figure out what I’m currently doing, what I’m capable of, and then, to test different strategies for making myself more productive.

My goal (far-fetched as it may right now seem) is to be eventually capable of putting in eight hours of focused work a day. This isn’t eight hours of manual labor (I currently work part-time washing tables); this is eight hours of focused, results-based work (for example studying, writing, or programming). I’d like to be capable of working hard for sixteen hours, if need be.

I’m going to use RescueTime to monitor my computer usage. I’m going to track TV and work time by hand, in a small notebook. I’m going to track sleep with SleepBot for Android. For the next week, I am going to try to be as accurate as possible in my recording. Based on how difficult this turns out to be, I may then record additional data, but I’ll try not to overwhelm myself and burn out. Again, the goal is to gain insight into what I’m doing with my day, and then to move on from there. And then I'm going to post that information.

I’m all too aware that the act of monitoring might influence my behavior or make me feel shit enough about myself to inspire preference for ignorance over information. (I’ve quit calorie counting before because I felt bad plugging in certain foods. Multiple times.) To combat this, my current goal is to just monitor things as best as possible – even if it reveals I spend more time on the computer than I do sleeping. Honestly, it’s a possibility.

I don't get a lot done; I already know that. Trying to change that is going to require knowing what I want, how to get it, and how far I am from getting it. I'm working on that last bit right now.

The inspiration for this project is Steve Pavlina's article on [self-discipline and self-acceptance](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/06/self-discipline-acceptance/).

My blog, which I'm going to *aim* to update daily, is http://quantifiedslacker.wordpress.com/. But seriously, that's not a plug or anything - it's my own personal accountability tool. If I find anything useful I'll trek back here and cough it all up via reddit sometime next week.

Please read.,CripplingPersonality,8,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1a87eb/i_have_come_the_realization_that_i_have_an/,"A bit of background: I am a 20 year old sophomore physics student at a well known university. Throughout my childhood and high school years, I was always able to coast by in school, possessing above average intelligence although definitely not genius level or anything (for reference, scored 1980/2400 on SATs, was in gifted program as a child, etc.). Near the end of my freshman year in high school I started smoking weed and quickly fell in love with getting high and the friends and good times that followed, as well as the general hippy/stoner culture. By the the end of junior year and through senior year I was pretty much high all day from before school until I went to bed. I had a job so money was never a problem, and I honestly never considered it an addiction. Around senior year I also started to play League of Legends, which I've since stopped playing only to replace it with DoTA2 (much better game, but that's besides the point). I have always loved video games, but with LoL/DoTA2 it was something I never experienced before with a video game. The thrill of winning through good team tactics and pulling off big plays in the MOBA genre has no parallel in other genres, IMO. I was (and still am) hooked. I've logged probably ~2000 hours between the two games since I started. If I'm on a losing streak, you better believe I'm playing until I win one, even if that means skipping class, staying up until 5am, etc. Again, I never considered playing them so much to be an addiction until recently.

Since coming to Uni, I have continued my habits (read: addictions) to my own detriment. I have said countless times that I'm done smoking for a while, only to buy another sack the next day. I've said that I'll cut back and only smoke on the weekends or nights, but it never happens: if I have weed, I smoke it. I've uninstalled both LoL and DoTA2 multiple times, claiming I'm done with the game, only to install it again later in the week. Both these things have caused me to miss many classes, labs, recitations, quizzes, and procrastinate my work until I need to pull stimulant-fueled all-night grinders. This has led directly to another blossoming addiction: Ritalin/Adderall. I started taking them to get work done, and now I'm almost at the point where it's impossible for me to get any real work done without them. Also, I've found that I absolutely love smoking cigarettes when I'm on these stimulants, and while I only smoke about a pack every week or two weeks, I'm worried that this too will get worse. 

I've been thinking a lot about why I act like this and why I am unable to stop myself, and I've come to the conclusion that I have an addictive personality. Has anyone gone through something like this? How do you cope? Should I try to quit all these things cold turkey?

Basically I'm thinking of a random online pal you check in with every day, via email or IM, and you go over your goals and where you're at with them, and where you're stuck. You keep another person on task and motivate them, help them find resources or information, and likewise your accountabilibuddy hounds you to get your things done and remind you how important it actually is to you.

I don't have too much problem getting things done when I know someone's watching (e.g. my job! I get super motivated to show off and make others' lives easier where I can), but when I'm the only one caring about my work, I can make any excuses I want to either get it done or let it slack...and let's face it, after a long work day, my personal projects feel less important than unwinding.

So, does such a pairing-up system already exist? If not, would anyone have any interest in this? Any thoughts on the best way to pair up?

I figure I would share my process as how I do it. There really isn't any special trick other than just ""doing it"". But I can make other peoples' lives a bit easier .....

**History:**

My problem when it comes to losing weight is lack of proper discipline. I tend to overeat healthy foods. It's a bitch when you eat healthy but still can't lose weight. Given that my days are very hectic and busy, it becomes very difficult to ensure I eat proper amount of food. It's very easy for me to over eat. E.g. If I don't drink enough water, I'll tend to over eat.

The only way I managed to lose weight previously was to count calories. But that's a bitch right? It sure was. I struggled for few years but thanks to Reddit, I came across one comment that just clicked: *""I am the happiest when I am disciplined""*. 

It clicked. It was absolutely true. I realized that all my past accomplishments were due to ""buckling down and getting shit done"". I was determined to figure out a practical system on how to lose weight by counting calories while minimizing all inconveniences.

Here is my system. I'm sure it's nothing really new...

**Planning**

I use MyFitnessPal.com to determine caloric requirements based on my weight, goals and 3-4 days of exercising. Example: 1900 calories/day.

I split my my day into 3 meals, 2 snacks (or protein shakes). I give more calories to meals than snacks. E.g. 400/meal &amp; 350/snack.

I make ""meal templates"" using Google Docs. The idea behind a ""meal template"" is for me to simply plug in ""1900 calories"" into the spreadsheet and the formulas will spit out the weight/quantity of each ingredient required to complete that meal. Each meal is also properly balanced on the macro-nutrition level (50% fat, 30% protein, 20% carbs or something like that). The advantage is that I now have an inventory of templates I can choose. No time wasted on repeatedly balancing each meal's nutritions.

Once I plug the 1900 calories/day into my selected ""meal/snack templates"", I get a list of ingredients with weight/quantity. This list is only for one meal. I choose the number of days I want to cover. Typically I choose 3-4 because vegetables go soggy afterwards and I find the taste of thawed vegetables to be worse than post-tequila vomit. So I take my weight/quantity ingredient list, multiply it by 3 (3 meals per day) and then multiply by 4 days. Same thing with snacks except we have 2 snacks per day. In this example, 3 meals * 4 days = 12 meals. 2 snacks * 4 days = 8 snacks. 

What you now have is a shopping list of ingredients to buy. The beauty of this is you know exactly how much to buy of everything. No more wasted food! I found thought that you typically need to buy a bit extra.

**Process**

Preparation is key! I prepare all ingredients - cutting vegetables, cooking the meat, etc. The idea is to have bowls/containers of all ingredients prepared to go.

I split my kitchen counter into 3 sections:
* Left = Containers/tupper-ware
* Center = Digital weight scale
* Right = Ingredients

I have about 20 equal size containers for food. They are all placed usually in a 4x3 grid to the left of an electric scale. I simply pick one ingredient and I equally distribute it into all containers. I do this by placing the container on the scale, dump the ingredient to the planned weight/quantity and place the container back to where it was in the grid. Repeat for each ingredient.

I try to run an ""efficient kitchen"". I always look for minor adjustments to speed things up. Here an example:

*Empty the garbage bag/container prior to starting. It's annoying to have an over flooding garbage in the middle of cooking. Keep the trash can out and next to you (not underneath the sink as usual). It's very easy to toss non-edible items (e.g. stems) straight into the garbage while cutting/preparing when it's next to you. You're also cleaning up at the same time.*

Tools are your friend! At first you will not have many. That's OK. Identify what repetitive process you may want to improve. If your tool is shitty, replace it with higher quality. Proper quality tools will save the most time and effort. Here is what I've collected over time:

* Peeling avocado: http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/kuhn-rikon-all-in-one-avocado-tool/?pkey=e%7Cavacado%7C8%7Cbest%7C0%7C1%7C24%7C%7C5&amp;cm_src=PRODUCTSEARCH||NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_-Feature_Recipe_Rule-_-
* Non-stick pans
* Proper cutting knives
* Mandolines - amazing for cutting vegetables very quickly. http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/de-buyer-deluxe-dicing-mandoline/?cm_src=AutoCatRel
* Kitchen Mixer - amazing for mashing up avocados. http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/kitchenaid-artisan-stand-mixer/?pkey=e%7Cmixer%7C36%7Cbest%7C0%7C1%7C24%7C%7C8&amp;cm_src=PRODUCTSEARCH||NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_-NoMerchRules-_-
* Electric weight scale - make sure to keep spare batteries. Last thing you want to happen is for the scale to die while in the middle of packaging food.

**Summary**

Here is a time break down as of today:

* Planning: 10 min approx.
* Purchasing ingredients: 1 hour
* Cooking: 2.5 hours approx
* Cleaning: 30 min

So in about 5 hours I have everything done and clean. I know this seems a lot and probably OCD-like. It's not. What I've done is basically:

* Prepared all my meals for 3-4 days
* Pre-calculated calorie requirements for weight lost
* Bought near exact amount of ingredients
* Freed up plenty of time for next 3-4 days
* Properly balanced meals
* You don't have to waste time counting calories every day.

I'm not the biggest fan of cooking for solo purposes. So I constantly look for areas to improve.

Here are some ways I've been able to use it:

* Playlists are your friend. The time investment to set up a few good playlists can pay dividends. This avoids sitting there fiddling with your iPod looking for the right song. Set up playlists and title them by mood or activity instead of genre; 'work', 'gym', 'contemplative', etc.

* Non lyrical music is awesome. There have been studies that show it's basically impossible to NOT follow the lyrics of music or spoken words. Our brains are hardwired to key into language. But you don't have to punish yourself to listen to instrumental music; whatever genres you like now probably has offered some great instrumental only music, from electronic to rock.

* Look for medium intensity music as well as high energy workout music. I enjoy some nice driving electric blues, trance music like Pictureplane, or jazz for just hanging out and doing work. You'll find that's when your discipline needs the most help.

* If I'm in a lazy or lethargic mood just putting on some pump up high energy music feels forced, it's like being around someone hyper when you want to go to sleep. On the other hand, the holy grail of motivational music for me is a song or playlist or album that reaches down, picks me up, and elevates me to motivated or positive. My favorite example is the Overture of 1812. Over the ~15 minute piece it starts slow and gradually crescendos into that awesome finale (seen V for Vendetta?) that never fails to encourage me. A lot of classical music does this for me because I feel like I follow it on a much more emotional level and that rising format is common for symphonies.

* Association is a powerful mental tool. If you listen to the same song every day right before your brush your teeth, after long enough listening to that song will make your teeth feel dirty. Ever notice how if you have a song that you mostly listen to in a playlist you probably can't name what song comes after it but as soon as it ends you're humming the next song up? Play a song while you stretch before your workout for a few days, you'll find that song will make you want to be active if you play it other times. Try using that song as your alarm clock.",,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,t3_1josku,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1josku/music_is_a_valuable_tool_for_motivation_and/,

I didn't know were to post it. If anyone has a better sub, please speak up.

Reddit, have you ever felt like you just want to die? Sorry for the dramatic start but i am totally stuck. 
Don't know what to do, I see no options. I thought I was in a better situation, but reality checks are a bitch. With the power of cognitive dissonance &amp; procrastination by my side I have made it thus far. Smoking weed in my later years ~~helped~~ me by ''feeling comfortable with the situation''. That and of course, being a tool for easier procrastinating. Even tho I sounds ironic: I was and am always on the look for solutions. But these solutions are running thin. Impending doom. Tick tock. There are a lot of more factors which I probably forgot to mention, but I am ~~a bit~~ emotional right now. 
This is how I reflect back on the issues I am facing, which I will try to explain now. It might seem as short sighted way of explaining the history, But I am not trying to write an autobiography here. Here goes.

When I was ~3 and my brother ~6 my mother committed suicide by taking an OD of prescription drugs. She was manic depressive for the largest part of her life. As I was 3, this part of my childhood (and about 10 years after that) are effectively *blocked* in my brain. And therefore, I have no memory of it. There might be one, but you never know If that's an projected image of a retold memory.
My dad worked at Sony at that time, head of about 15~ staff. He had to quit this job because he wasn't allowed / was not possible for him. 
He worked as a taxi driver and a bar keeper later on. He developed a increasingly stronger alcohol addiction. Why? He developed this for the same reason I used to like weed for all these years. It stops the feels.

Fast forward ''the same old shit'' to about 2004-2005. 
Woke up by a loud screaming ''COME DOWN NOW''. Me and my brother rush out of our rooms to open the door to the stair that leads downstairs. The moment I open it a wall of smoke hits my face. Adrenaline and *survival instinct* kick in. I don't know exactly what happened after that. But I do know at a certain time I walk in the wrong room (the room the fire started) because well, you can't see shit with your eyes closed. Eventually we make it out and we are *safe* on the street. Looking at our windows on the third floor.  A homeless man walks by and rubs over my hair as apparently it was still ~~on fire~~ smoldering. He took of his sweater and pulled it over my head only to wander off afterwards. (Yes this really happened, wtf right?) The windows popped about 10 seconds later and a huge flame shoots inside. 

I run around in my underwear ringing people's doorbell saying ''my house is on fire, call the police (along those lines). People did not respond after saying that. I walk back to my brother and father. About 10-13 minutes later, police and firetrucks ~~finally~~ show up (as the hospital is 6-7 minutes walking distance) 
Got into hospital, got longs checked and banded. Once in awhile ill cough up charcoal of 1-2 cm~. All in all, I was the most severe burned and have no lasting damage. All in all, we were really lucky. We could have all died if it took half a minute more. 


There is much more to this. For instance, how you will actually participate in getting financially raped. I think the word for it is insurance. You get the general idea. After that we were forced to life in a ''shelter'' for about 6 months. Horrible place, people would steal shit from other rooms. All people who come from ''broken homes'' and have been trough one trauma or the other. 

I personally became very unmotivated at school, hell - I didn't even go for months on end. At that time I was doing the ''second highest'' high school level. I dropped down two levels in the years after that.

Everyone was obviously traumatized. My dad started to drink more. I started having one bad repeating dream about an previous event. These dreams had an ''alternative ending'' ~~ifyouknowwhatimean~~.
Now, I am not telling this background for myself. At least, not directly. I have recovered and I'd like to think my mental health is pretty decent. I am now, in a situation were I see no solution. 

My dad has COPD, a long disease. He drinks and smokes everyday.  He would/is even ~~steal~~ ~~drink~~ take my booze if I would have any. Caught him using my debit card more then once..
All in all, he's a total self destructing train wreck. It's even so bad that he told me that he wants to die. Told me he thinks about ''going like my mom'' but could never do the same. I told him he is doing the same, only slower. He said he doesn't care. 

We tried alcohol clinics, psychiatrists , interventions many times. Tried talking to him lot of times. He has given up hope and so do I. I cannot legally force him to a clinic *even* if I wanted to. This might sound **really** fucked up, but it's like he's implying I should kill him. **Obviously I would never do this** **IWOULDREALLYNOT**
Even tho I had similar conversations during the years, as you get older your knowledge increases - and therefor your perspective changes with it. This was my reality check. 

Before I move up to the last bit I want to make sure you know this. 
I am not looking for money, I would never ever accept any as I am too proud for that.  I say this, because I know how the Internet thinks sometimes :/. I am telling this whole story so you understand why I am in this problem. Anyway, moving on. 
I now have about 600 EU for 22 days. My dad has no money and is buried in debt (inb4 they come to take stuff). He's gonna need money for his addictions, which I don't have to spare. And which I normally try to avoid as much as possible. But guilt and emotions yadayada.
And money is not even the main problem here. Its my dad his mental state. I don't know what to do. I have people IRL where I talk about these things. Everyone offers to help in some way. ''Well if there is anything i can do...'' But the problem is, I don't even know what I can do. 

Maybe here, some insight might be given. Some greater purpose, some motivation. Something, anything. 
Tick Tock. 

Thanks for reading.

A lot of people say things like ""I don't know how I got discipline"", or ""these are the reasons why you should be disciplined"", or ""just do it"". The problem with that is, quite often my brain says ""yeah, I know all the reasons why I should be doing something, but you still aren't going to force me to do it"".

I guess it's worth remembering that discipline is doing what you DON'T want to do, so that means you are never really going to enjoy doing it. If you are enjoying it, or you have become motivated and think ""ok now I want to do it"", then that for me is not discipline. Now you are motivated and you don't need discipline. In my case motivation is nice when I can get it, but it doesn't last very long.

To get around these issues, I have made use of a few analogies. You can see discipline as a huge boulder. You can't just kick a goal with it, you have to push it very slowly at first, then faster, then faster. Or maybe look at it like a car. You don't just get in the car and instantly drive at full speed. You need to go slowly and accelerate.

This is the method that I use every time I need discipline, which could be once a month or several times a day:

* think of something trivially easy which has no particular purpose and do it, e.g. put your finger on your nose (your brain cannot object to something so easy, or if it does, it should be easy for you to overcome it; if not, choose something even easier)

* increase the difficulty by 5%: sit up straight, or hold your arm up in the air

* go up another 5%: stand on one foot

* acknowledge that regardless of what you are doing, you have just now exercised some discipline

* increase the difficulty again in each subsequent step: pick up that book you should be reading, then read just one sentence, then just one paragraph

* acknowledged that you have increased your discipline at each step

* pretty soon you will realise that you are now doing what your mind was objecting to, and you will just continue doing it.


To someone who is already motivated or disciplined, this method may seem childish, however for me this succeeds when all other advice fails. Hopefully some other people might find it useful.

**TL;DR** Start trivially easy and work your way up from there, taking it one step at a time.

I'm currently in this situation and need some help:

I'm currently studying at home on my own, because I had anxiety that made me leave school. I need to study everyday. The more, the better and the earlier I'm out of this situation. While I'm working on my anxiety the studying part worries me the most. I have goals and I have motivation but a lack of self discipline. I study mostly for 30mins and then take a log break and then study another 30mins. In a day I study about 1h and 30mins total. I study, because I'm gonna have exams after this which (when I pass) allow me to go to university. Another problem is, that I'm super lazy in the morning. I sleep in every day and I'm at a point where it sucks, but I can't bring myself into getting up early. I'm exercising a bit almost every day. I'm currently procrastinating with reddit and video games. I get tired of studying very fast. My goal of self discipline is not only the studying part, but also to get disciplined in other areas of life. So if you have any advice I would appreciate it :)

In tenth grade, I went from being a completely lazy but anxious-about-my-grades piece of shit that played video games way too much (don't get me wrong; it's okay to play, but I went overboard) to a hardworking yet still pretty anxious kid in about a month or two. I got all A's that year, and trust me, when I got those report cards, I was one of the happiest kids ever. It wasn't all pretty however. That year, I was pretty bad socially both when I played video games and when I was a grade maniac. Furthermore, whenever, I had something ""terrible"" happen to me during the grade maniac time, like losing a study sheet that was the only thing we could use to study for the final, I had an anxiety attack. Still, these were rare. 

My attitude with school in general was kind of interesting as well. I would try to make everything absolutely perfect, from my memorization of formulas to my handwriting and even my class discussions that didn't even have anything to do with my grades but made me feel ""smart"" when I made a good point. I was a ""brown noser"" as well. The results were fantastic when it came to numbers. My lowest grade was a 96, and I was in all honors and AP courses. 

During the summer after tenth grade, I didn't have much to worry about. I was just volunteering at a hospital where I learned that I was truly lacking in social skills. I tried to develop these, but in reality, I just felt really depressed and thought I was a loser. I also had terrible acne and that made me depressed as well. Furthermore, I had an insomnia problem which affected me greatly in the next school year. 

Contrary to the summer, the first month of junior year wasn't that bad. I had terrific grades and every weekend I would hang out with my friends. My insomnia, however, would be a giant pitfall. I missed school for three in one week at the end of the first month and went to a psychiatrist who gave me sleep meds. I didn't take them since I was a dumbass. After missing those three days, my life went downhill. I regained my depression, didn't hang out with friends, and my grades started tanking. I had several delusions most likely due to a lack of sleep. For instance, I thought me and one of my teachers secretly had a ""thing."" A couple months later after a terrible incident where my delusions were at their peak, I started taking the meds like I was supposed to. I finished that semester with three B's and three A's so it wasn't terrible, but I was kicking my self a lot over it. 

This semester was completely about me trying to regain my edge in grades. I looked up a whole bunch of articles about self-discipline, but I couldn't make lasting changes. I had a pretty relaxed semester in general and my social skills improved a lot. I wasn't delusional or depressed any longer, and I slept without meds. Despite all these advantages, I still wanted to work on my discipline where I could make great grades again. The truth was, my ""relaxed"" period wasn't very relaxed since I was constantly anxious about my future. 

Lately I have realized that the difference was in my mindset. When I was successful, I was a perfectionist; I wanted to be a ""good"" student. When I wasn't so successful, I put my health first no matter what (this semester, not the ""delusional"" one) which was good. However, I procrastinated a shit ton. That's where I stand now-- a procrastinator who wants good grades but a healthy life as well. Maybe it's not possible. Maybe there's not enough time in the day. One thing I do know is that I waste a lot of time on the computer, so hopefully there's a chance. 

**TLDR: I used to care about video games, and I didn't get good grades. Then I cared about grades, and I got good grades. Then I got depressed and had major health problems and lost my track. Now I'm a procrastinator and my grades suck. Your thoughts and actions are in direct correlation to your results.**

By the way, I know this is not a ground breaking new theory about self-discipline, but I thought you might want to use the mindset I had when I was successful with grades. The reason I'm not using it now is because I literally just came to this realization about half an hour ago. You also may want to think about how you are going to balance your social life and your work life and how to make sure you stay psychologically healthy while working hard.

He says he's made the class as easy as can be with out just dumbing it down, which I can respect. The worst part is that the entire class is out of 200 points. I need 146 total to pass with a C. I've got 102.5 right now. We've got one more quiz coming up that's out of 10 questions, always T/F and Multiple Choice. This is helpful because he drops the lowest quiz grade. So as long as I score better than a 4.5 (my lowest quiz grade) I won't need that 43.5/50 on the final exam, I'll need slightly less. The issue is that every question is worded so technically it's easy to get tricked by even a single word.

The part that's hardest for me is that the class seems to be mostly memorization of a million facts, court cases, terms, etc. It's frustrating because I've learned the concepts, I know what I can or can not legally do from this class, but I can't cite the specific court case from 1972 off the top of my head in a multiple choice setting telling you exactly why I'm not allowed to say ""fuck"" on the radio.

So I've always been bad at sticking to to-do lists, and I've experimented with paper to-do lists, iPhone apps, sticky notes, you name it. But I found a new way.

Maybe it won't work for everybody but instead of having throwaway bits of paper that I use for to-do lists (which I can easily throw away if I fail to do everything and forget about it), I keep a book now. It's a nice little book and I write everything I have to do there as a list and when it's done I can cross it out with a nice satisfying red line. It allows you to look back at the things you were supposed to do, either with positive reinforcement because you think, ""Oh yeah, I did that, hurray!"" or making you feel bad for not doing it and the reminder to do it is inescapable because it's in this little book that you can carry around with you everywhere. 

And if you're like me and you don't want to fail and not be able to cross something out, it means you'll think really carefully about choosing tasks which are achievable. Smaller steps, as we all know = bigger results.

I'd like advice on how to achieve 68% in my exams given my difficulties that I would also like to share. I do quite a stringent course which I have found overwhelming at multiple times both in workload and in the work content. Being overwhelmed has led me to procrastination which is my 2nd problem.

I have three months to get myself to a point where I can get 68% in these exams. It is possible, I have read books such as the Now Habit and have come a long way from where I was last year, however I have only achieved 59% in my recent exams which means I now want 1st class results in my finals to get the 2.1.

Hard work is something I'm happy to do, but combating the overwhelmed nature and procrastination is something I still find alien. What would your advice be?

Cheers guys, advice has been a great help.

Listed: 

* Work hard.

* Aim to complete time rather than work; simple Pomodoros of 30mins are good for this as it's a time requirement rather than a work goal which can be ambiguous

* Find a place to study

* Limit distractions; ie prepare food rather than getting food and other

* Get off da internet!",,False,,t5_2uzju,1360685799.0,,,True,t3_18bsvl,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/18bsvl/i_have_3_months_to_get_myself_an_average_of_68_in/,

I, like many of you, struggle with procrastination. One thing that I find will motivate me like no other is accountability. That is why I created /r/MakeAGoal. The best way I could describe it would be as /r/90daysgoal but for whatever kind goal you want in whatever period of time you deem appropriate. As you will surely see, it is in it's very early days (hours) of infancy, but I have high hopes for making it a productive community where we can share our goals and offer insight with another.
