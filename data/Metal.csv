1367532170.0,2677,self.Metal,1dkvm3,*** JEFF HANNEMAN 1964 - 2013 *** RIP,slackerdc,5397,2720,530,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1dkvm3/jeff_hanneman_1964_2013_rip/,"Slayer is devastated to inform (their fans) that their bandmate and brother, Jeff Hanneman, passed away at about 11AM this morning near his Southern California home. Hanneman was in an area hospital when he suffered liver failure. He is survived by his wife Kathy, his sister Kathy and his brothers Michael and Larry, and will be sorely missed.  

Last Update in this thread 5/3/13 4:00PDT anything else to come out after this will be in a new post. Also Slayer is back on the r/metal blacklist until I hope next year's national day of Slayer.

You helped make our 11-part documentary TV series Metal Evolution a huge success. It hit #1 on VH1 Classic and MuchMore and has aired on networks in the UK, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Brazil, India. Australia and elsewhere.  Despite this success, however, there was one glaring gap in the series: There was no episode on Extreme Metal.  Like many of you, I grew up listening (and continue to listen) to bands like Death, Carcass, Napalm Death, Entombed, Celtic Frost, Opeth, Enslaved etc. and feel that Extreme Metal is not an underground obscurity in the history of metal - it’s a hugely important chapter in this story.  Also hundreds of fans from around the world have contacted us saying that an Extreme Metal episode needs to be made.  So we approached several networks about financing this “Lost Episode” but they passed, saying it’s too extreme for their viewers. 

And so we’ve launched an IndieGoGo campaign to raise funds to create this episode and I was hoping you could help spread the word about the campaign.  We need your help to raise $135,000 by December 14!  Details of the campaign, including cool donor gifts at various contribution levels can be found here: [http://www.indiegogo.com/ExtremeMetal] (http://www.indiegogo.com/ExtremeMetal)

Status Update
By Dave Lombardo
Statement From Dave Lombardo Regarding Slayer Australian Tour 2013

I want to personally apologize to all of our fans in Australia who have bought tickets for the tour expecting to see me in my usual place on the drums.

So that you all know the truth, as of the end of the business day on February 14th, I was notified that I would not be drumming for the tour in Australia. I’m saddened, and to be honest I am shocked by the situation. 

Last year, I discovered 90% of Slayer’s tour income was being deducted as expenses including the professional fees paid to management, costing the band millions of dollars and leaving 10% or less to split amongst the four of us. In my opinion, this is not the way a band’s business should operate. I tried rectifying it by letting my band mates know, and Tom and I hired auditors to figure out what happened, but I was denied access to detailed information and the necessary back up documents. 

I spent the Christmas and New Year holidays realizing I had toured all over the world in 2012, but yet, had not been paid (except a small advance) or provided a proper accounting for a full year's sweat and blood. On top of this, I was told that I would not be paid until I signed a long form contract which gave me no written assurance of how much or on what basis management would deduct commissions, nor did it provide me access to the financial budgets or records for review. It also forbade me to do interviews or make statements having to do with the band, in effect a gagging order.

Last Monday, I sat down with Kerry and Tom to rehearse for Australia and to propose a new business model that I felt was the best way forward for Slayer to confidently protect itself so we could do what we do best . . . play for the fans. Kerry made it clear he wasn’t interested in making changes and said if I wanted to argue the point, he would find another drummer. On Thursday, I arrived at rehearsals at 1 pm as scheduled, but Kerry did not show. Rather, at 6:24 pm I received an email from the lawyers saying I was being replaced for the Australian dates.

I remain hopeful that we can resolve our issues. But once again, I sincerely apologize to all of our fans in Australia who spent their money expecting to see the 3 of us original Slayer members.
I look forward to seeing you in the future.

Sincerely,
Dave Lombardo",,False,,t5_2qhud,1361497565.0,,,True,t3_18xwmy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/18xwmy/dave_lombardo_is_no_longer_in_slayer_taken_from/,

Evil Army, who just finished their East Coast tour, was found to be in possession of stolen gear that belonged to the bassist of Sadistic Ritual (an incredible and young thrash/death metal band from Atlanta). Prior to the Birmingham show, they played Atlanta, where they borrowed equipment from another band Disfigurement. After Evil Army left, the Sadistic Ritual bassist saw that his gear was gone from the storage room. Word quickly spread to Birmingham, and the good people there saw that they were using the exact gear that was missing. The Birmingham scene took action and confronted Evil Army, who denied everything, when it was clear that they were borrowing gear in nearly every city and that this exactly matched the description of what was taken. The situation got nasty and Evil Army got the shit kicked out of them. 

Next, Aaron Kelly (roadie/merch for Evil Army) took to facebook to post this on the Evil Army [page](https://www.facebook.com/EvilArmyofficial?fref=ts)...
&gt; THAT WAS A BADASS TOUR. EVERY CITY WAS AWESOME. THE VENUES WERE PACKED OUT AND WE SOLD OUT OF MERCH BY THE TIME THE NEW ORLEANS SHOW WAS OVER. THANKS TO EVERY ONE FOR COMING OUT TO SUPPORT EVIL ARMY. WEST COAST TOUR COMING UP. WILL BE BIGGER AND BETTER. oh and just a ps. no one gives a shit about what the little people in ga are saying. everyone knows better than to believe their shit. no sweat off our backs and we r gonna keep on thrashn. 

and this...

&gt;who ever is saying evil army stole something needs to come to memphis and say it to our face. did you see our badass van and all our equipment?? WE dont need to steal we have everything we need. our new bass player was borrowing equipment AT EVERY SHOW AND WE ALSO HAVE A BASS RIG ON BACKORDER THAT IS PAID FOR SO THERE IS NO REASON TO STEAL FROM ANYONE. SO ALL U BITCHES TALKING SHIT GO FUCK URSELF AND KNOW UR FACTS BEFORE U START ACCUSING SHIT. LAST NITE IN BIRMINGHAM SOMEONE STOLE FROM US AND WE KICK SOME DUDES ASS OVER IT SO IT WONT BE A PROB DOING IT AGAIN.

The fact of the matter is that according to several witnesses, Evil Army did not ""kick some dudes ass"". In fact, they got the shit kicked out of them and they retreated into their van to run away. Also, taking back what is rightfully yours is not stealing. They were caught red handed and they are denying everything. 

This band is a bunch of junkies. Don't let them come to your city and steal from your locals in the future. Word is already quickly spreading and there has been a tremendous amount of support shown for the Atlanta locals who got fucked over. Organizers/bookers from all the way down south and all the way up to Canada have said that Evil Army is no longer welcome in their cities. The gear is now in the possession of friends in Birmingham and will be recovered shortly. 

Thank you to those who take a stand against this sort of behavior, especially thanks to the great people in Birmingham. You don't fuck over your own kind like this. 

Edit - Please upvote for visibility and spread the word on any relevant forums, pages, etc.

Edit 2 - Turns out Aaron Kelly is the merch girl I believe, not a member of the band. Also, some witnesses say that she threatened to shoot everyone before they retreated into their van (not sure if they actually possessed a gun or not). Fortunate that no innocent people were hurt by this psycho.

Edit 3 - Turns out the gear they actually borrowed during the show was Disfigurement's according to the Disfigurement singer. They must have gone into the storage room at the venue and taken the amp that belonged to Sadistic Ritual from that room.

Today tickets for Black Sabbath's warm up gig in Birmingham, UK (One of only 2 dates with Tony Iommi) went on sale. Literally within a few minutes the gig was sold out, which I can understand, it's a big thing.

BUT..

Within minutes of the show selling out there were absolutely loads available on Viagogo, Ebay etc. (Some of which having been posted within minutes of the presale starting yesterday morning). These tickets are going for upwards of £100 (Face value £45).

Does anyone else think that it's shit like this is just plain wrong? Some of the tickets listed will possibly not even sell (I mean there's one there for £400, come on!) Surely governments should crack down on this instead of on piracy? Artists must miss out on more revenue as a result of this black market of tickets.

TL;DR Sabbath tickets being bought to sell at a huge profit instead of going direct to fans who actually want to see the gig.

As someone with a non-mainstream music taste (metal, obviously), I've gotten used to listening to music at parties and such that I wouldn't listen to by myself. I'm not just grumpily tolerating it, I honestly don't mind at all. If people legitimately enjoy the music they're putting on, then I support that and will probably even enjoy it (it's still music after all).

But this attitude is almost never reciprocated. I was at a party earlier (happy new year!), and the music ran out at one point. I suggested I put on some 'chilled out, ambient music'. Fully aware that the people around me detested metal, I was absolutely not about to put on metal. And yet,  I got skeptical looks, and was told that people wouldn't want to listen to my music, and a bit of a disagreement followed.

I am offended for two reasons. 

Firstly, why the hell not? People seem to tolerate listening to each other's music all the time, across a wide range of genres. Why is metal an exception?

Secondly, knowing metal wouldn't be tolerated, I wasn't even suggesting it (I actually had [this playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=AL94UKMTqg-9CooUGF_EedWXgrb5ECULhl) in mind). And yet even though I described it as ambient and chilled out (my exact words), people assumed I was trying to sneakily get some metal in without them noticing (like they wouldn't!). So I'm insulted because my friends seem to think that I'm so socially unaware that I wouldn't accommodate their distaste of metal. 

This has happened several times with the same group, I really would have thought by now that they would know that I am capable of choosing music everyone will like (or at least tolerate). And it's not that I'm crap at choosing music, because they judge me when they don't even know what I'm going to put on yet! One time I was like 'hey, I'll put on the Fratellis, that'll be fun!', and I got the same reaction (No, don't put on your music!), because people didn't know who the Fratellis are even though they're happy fun pop rock. Similarly with the Butterfly Effect (ok, maybe they're a bit heavy), and Pixies, people just *assumed* it was going to be horrible melodic death metal, because they hadn't heard of them and they know that's what I'm into. This includes the above chillout playlist even though I had described it as basically the *opposite* of metal.

Though ideally I wish this wasn't an issue at all and I could just put my music on the same way everyone else does.

Why the intolerance?

Seeing as how Mastodon is my favorite band, I decided to do a guide to Mastodon! 

**Remission** - This is a very out of control riff-house type album. The vocals are all not necessarily screamed, but, they are in between yelling and death metal vocals. As for the music, it's tons of crunchy riffs with some bad ass jazz-like drumming in the background. Very raw, spastic, and over all just kick ass metal. The album is loosely based on the theme of fire. Some of of the must listen tracks are [March of the Fire Ants](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MarWv25GOyw) and [Mother Puncher](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muFtXyTZKKY)

**Leviathan** - This album's most notable change is the fact that the vocals sounds more like rough, angry grunts than the yelling/screaming vocals in Remission. Musically, the album took a different direction. The album is a bit more melodic and the song structure is overall more thought out. This album is also a concept album, based around the book ""Moby Dick"" and also the theme of water in general. The crunchy sounding riffs are still there and its still fucking bad ass. As for what songs are must listens, [Blood and Thunder](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-Su1YXQYek) and [Iron Tusk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzVcC0TAN8k) would serve you right.

**Blood Mountain** - This is when everything gets more proggy. This album is, again, a concept album that tells the story of a man who is trying to climb Blood Mountain to place the crystal skull at the top. It's about his whole journey up there with the different things he encounters. This album sounds different than the previous albums in a sense that it's just angry, riffy metal. It's sort of toned down a bit in terms of riffage, but, its not a bad thing. It sounds a bit more patient and smoother, if that makes sense. There'll be parts when the music tones down and its clean vocals kick in and it gets less heavy sounding. Speaking of vocals, the vocals are half clean and half yelled/grunted/whatever. Must listens are [The Wolf is Loose](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm9P1QsoGhw) and [Siberian Divide](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2IGkpkagz8)

**Crack The Skye** - This is when things get REALLY proggy. The album is another concept album story. This time, the story is much more elaborate. In the shortest way I can explain it, it's about this quadriplegic boy who learns how to separate his soul from his body, but, he flies too close to the sun when hes out of his body and it burns his golden umbilical cord that keeps him from drifting off. He begins to drift off into space, but, gets sucked into a wormhole where he explains to the spirits that he's not dead. They send him to Czarist era Russia where cultists are performing a divination. He ends up in the body of Rasputin. He explains to Rasputin his situation, but, then Czarina warns Rasputin that he's going to be assassinated. Instead of avoiding this, Rasputin goes to his assassination destination so that he can guide the boy back to his body. After he dies, they fly between heaven and hell where Satan intercepts them and takes them to hell. They escape and its assumed they either make it to his body or stay in space forever. The album is also generally based around the element of Ether. Sorry, I had to explain that whole thing. This album is much less heavy than their previous work. It has a bit of a softer, creepy class rock feel to it in a way, but, it's still metal. There's many more guitar solos, practically in every song. The music is also slower paced and uses powerful clean vocals with perfectly executed guitar parts instead of thrashing riffs and harsh vocals. It's not something you headbang the whole way through, but, you have to sit down and listen to it carefully to enjoy it. This is also my favorite album of all time and what I think is Mastodon's best album. Must listens are [Oblivion](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzQ5o7b7qf0) and [The Czar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jx2fp-kKOIw)

**The Hunter** - The Hunter is kind of the result of them getting tired of making these elaborate concept albums, so, they decided to take a break and just make a good metal album. Stylistically, its heavier than Crack The Skye, but, not as heavy as their other albums, but, it still maintains their sound. It's got some sweet riffs and some good vocal pieces. It's a perfectly put together album for what it is, if that makes sense. Must listens are [Curl of the Burl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAihDAJX8Ow) and [Stargasm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fte2YrMta7g)

**Call of The Mastodon** - This is just a remastered compilation of their demo with one new song, which is simply called ""Call of The Mastodon"". The vocals on the album are similar to Remission, in a sense that theyre using the death metal yelling hybrid vocals. The vocals almost sound like battle chants, delivery is definitely a lil different. There's definitely some grind influence in here. Musically, its just a lot of bad ass riffs, not too melodic, just plundering, pillaging riffs to headbang to. It seems like they wanted to pump out a bunch of angry, bursty, spastic metal songs, which they did. Fantastic songs. Must listens are [Shadows That Move]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o93ttGgeUX4) and [Hail To Fire]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIwFfdUD2TE)

If you're interested in Mastodon, hopefully I did a good job with this. Please tell me how I did. Thanks for reading, it was fun to make!

I don't fucking like Black Metal, but you don't see me commenting on every Black Metal link posted with ""hey look, another song with terrible production.  I guess ProTools is too popular for these hipsters, huh?  I guess they just want their LPs to sound like demos.""

Get the fuck off your high horses people; our diverse tastes in music are what makes metal great.  Without that, we don't have the speed that punk brought us, the live shows inspired by arena rock, the solos inspired by blues and classical music, or the epic vocals drawn straight from opera and classical performance.  Act like you've got some common fucking decency about yourselves, and start respecting that there are people out there who will like bands that you do not.  Just hide their submissions and move along.

Ban me if you want, but for fuck's sake this needs to be said.  You act like ""hipsters"" are ruining metal; no, elitist metalheads like you are, because all you do is pick out bands that you don't like and bash them for not being exactly what you want to hear.  You know, [the same thing that critics did to the original Black Sabbath LP when it first hit shelves](http://bit.ly/dmfk6j).

EDIT: Alright, seems like a lot of Shreddit is weighing in here.  Good.

Oh yeah, and mayonesa- as far as me shitting on other people, thinking my opinion should be law, etc.- I'm not the one calling for the death of whatever metal I don't like.  It's my opinion that this board should at least be civil and respectful, and if that's not your opinion, then I'm not altogether sure you belong here.  If you think that this subreddit should be a place for you to spout off about how much you hate [X]'s musical taste, perhaps we need a r/metalcirclejerk for you and the rest of the ""old school"" guys on here.

My opinion differs from your because where mine fosters intelligent discussion and thoughtful commentary, yours just plays the ""hipster trash, kill it because I don't like it"" card over and over and over and over and over and over and over...",,False,,t5_2qhud,True,,,True,t3_cyf1e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/cyf1e/this_hipster_metal_bullshit_is_really_starting_to/,

Basically, this trickles down to Opeth, Opeth, Mastodon, Opeth, Dethklok, Tool, Iron Maiden, Opeth, Meshuggah, Amon Amarth, Slayer, Opeth...  
  
And while this is great, I think it highlights the need for our blacklist.  By constantly submitting these bands over and over, we drown out other, perhaps lesser known or under appreciated bands that deserve just as much attention.  I would venture to say that most of us here know how awesome Blackwater Park is, but that doesn't mean we need to post songs from it every week.

Also, a non-blacklisted band covering a blacklisted band will be removed.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Hey shreddit, in the last few weeks there has been a [vocal](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/shzoe/all_the_people_who_are_submitting_opeth_videos/) [push](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/orq21/whats_the_point_of_posting_unknown_bands_here/) to stop reposts of massively popular bands such as Iron Maiden on this subreddit; despite the quality of the music it stagnates the subreddit. So we're going to try an expirement: For the next seven days, any links to ***music*** by

* Black Sabbath
* Judas Priest
* Iron Maiden 
* Motörhead
* Metallica
* Megadeth
* Slayer
* Anthrax
* Mastodon
* Meshuggah
* Amon Amarth
* Devin Townsend
* Dethklok
* Opeth
* Pantera
* Manowar
* Death

will be removed.

This is an effort to have more varied music submitted to the subreddit, with less apparent karma-whoring. 

This list will also be in the sidebar for reference. We also ask for everyone to please try and submit newer bands to the subreddit and use the vote buttons!

Lastly, this is only applicable to **songs**. News, interviews, etc. pertaining to the above bands is still allowed and encouraged. ",[Announcement],False,,t5_2qhud,1340550830.0,genre,lastfm,True,t3_smons,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/smons/on_reposts/,moderator

I want to thank all the bands I've seen for playing with such passion and conviction despite the utter dearth of money in this genre. I want to thank all the promoters for putting together bills that not only put my favourite acts on but also introducing me to new ones. I want to thank the record labels for supporting bands I love in ways I couldn't possibly manage. 

You guys are the reason I put up with all the bullshit. Every day I get accused of worshipping Satan or eating babies because I wear an Iron Maiden t-shirt. I explain why they're wrong, but they don't want to listen. They just want to stroke their egos and put down the guy who's not afraid to be passionate about something mildly alternative. So many people seem to be just content with passing through life, not finding anything to truly love, and it saddens me. 

Everything about heavy metal: The music, the showmanship, the musicianship, the camaraderie, the community and the history makes me happy. I love you all. God help me if I didn't have the internet, knowing there are so many like me.

The demo tape has only circulated amongst the band and close fans/friends. 

It contains rare pre-release mixes of five songs, including ""Pictures of Matchstick Men"" with Peter Steele on vocals instead of Ozzy Osbourne.

Last year, a studio copy of the tape, labeled by Peter Steele, was auctioned off on eBay. 
It sold for $800. 

Earlier, one of the Type O Negative family was generous enough to post the entire October Rust demo tape on youtube for all who care to hear. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54ugzJNjMR0&amp;feature=youtu.be

There it is. Spread the word. 


**EDIT**
If you don't like Type O Negative, don't down vote this post. Just leave it.
If this thing gets enough up votes, more people will be able to see it and hear the demo. 
But, like I said, this is only for TON fans. 

**EDIT**
This is not the ENTIRE October Rust demo tape. Only half. Sorry for the mistake.

As a fan of a broad spectrum of metal, it's easy to notice that the more mainstream bands get a lot of hate. They're not metal enough, not good enough, not complex enough, or simply appeal to an audience that most of us are not a part of. 

However, I feel one thing is overlooked: *These are the bands that help pull kids into metal.*

Few, if any, metal-heads simply begin by liking the bands we grow to like - take, Cannibal Corpse or Meshuggah, for instance. The growls and screams, the distorted guitar, the complex drums, these are things that grow on you, slowly (or sometimes quickly) and over time. 

So, even though bands like Five Finger Death Punch are too radio-friendly and perhaps even musically devoid (and often arrogant), they are certainly good for helping developing metal-heads find their way to the heavier, more intricate bands that we know and love, a stepping stone of sorts.

So, even though we may not like these bands or respect them, it disheartens me to see so much hatred given to the metal*ish* bands that help to spread our beloved genre to a much broader audience, and I suppose I simply want to take a moment to acknowledge these bands for being the entry-level bands they are when it comes to the metal genre(s). These are the bands that mix into the radio lineups of Nickleback and Theory of a Deadman and Limp Biscuit, and these are the bands that help others submerge themselves in metal, the tip of the iceberg, if you will.

Okay, now let the downvotes flow.

Down-voting is ineffective in stopping this type of content, due to a simple matter of time. It takes a second to view and upvote an image meme, whereas 4 minutes or more need to be spent on a song. This problem can only get worse as we expand, so we the moderators have decided to nip it in the bud.

Please hit the report button on any offending content, and we will remove it.

Please send all your memes to this subreddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/MetalMemes/

[rant],celticmagnum,416,71,231,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/10nton/just_because_im_a_big_guy_doesnt_mean_i_want_to/,"Hey everyone. I just got back from seeing Obituary (which was awesome!!!) and I feel like I need to let out a little rant. I'm a pretty big guy, pushing 6'5 and 230 pounds, I'm the kind of guy you'd expect to be tearing up a moshpit at every show. The trouble is, I don't like to mosh, in fact I dislike it, I'd rather be watching the musicians perform and just headbanging.

I like to stand in between the stage and the pit because that's the best place to stand at my local venue, I realize I'm a better door than a window so I usually stand at the back of the throngs of people in front of the stage, and I usually have my back turned to the pit. Every fucking show some douchebag will punch me, or try to grab and pull me into the pit, and some people have straight up done a running headbutt into my back trying to get me into the pit. There's nothing more irritating than being bodyslammed repeatedly by some drunken shitbag while trying to enjoy a concert.

If you mosh at concerts, please realize that there are some people out there who don't want to mosh, don't be that guy who kicks and punches people in the crowd, those people are the worst kind of people ever

Sorry for my long rant, I'm tired and I should be going to bed... Obituary ruled though! \m/

In one of my classes at Walter Reed, taught by a teacher whose name I don't remember, sat next to me was a leather-clad metalhead who was waaay too old to be in the class. I snuck to school my parents' Ghostbusters soundtrack tape and taped over the tabs so it could be recorded over. I'd only just started listening to heavy metal on the local radio station (KNAC) and I was hooked, but I knew there had to be something heavier and darker out there. So I mustered up the nerve and handed this metalhead the Ghostbusters soundtrack and said ""can you record the the most evil metal album you have on this tape?"" He looked me dead in the eye, said ""yeah"" and took the tape.

The next day he handed the tape back to me and said ""you can't ever tell your parents where you got this from, or let them hear it.""

That night, after everyone had gone to bed, I hid under my covers and played this tape on my cheap boombox with my ear next to one of the speakers as the sound of the first track of Hell Awaits slowly built with a low demonic voice repeating a phrase over and over. It was the. most. evil thing I had ever heard, and it was AMAZING. 

Jeff Hanneman's passing hits pretty hard for me, and for a lot of metalheads out there.

The moderators have decided on a rule change, /r/Metal will no longer be host to image posts.

&gt; **No Pictures At All**

&gt; Instead post to /r/MusicPics, /r/AlbumArtPorn, /r/InstrumentPorn, /r/BandPorn, /r/MetalMemes, /r/LookWhoIMet, /r/Pics or /r/MetalPorn

The reason for this change is a core reddit problem. It takes a second to view &amp; upvote an image - regardless of quality, while it can take 3-4 minutes to listen to a song, or read an article.

As the subreddit grows (115 subscriptions per day), eventually we will be left with a page of images.

The mission statement will be changed from:

&gt; All things metal, including death metal, black metal, thrash metal, speed metal, doom metal, traditional metal, power metal, grindcore, etc.

to:

&gt; Music, news and discussion: death metal, black metal, thrash metal, speed metal, doom metal, traditional metal, power metal, grindcore, etc.

----

In addition, we're holding off enforcing self-post only Fridays, though it will still be designated in the sidebar. SPF was introduced to help with content stagnation, but it has fallen victim to the problem it was fighting. Hopefully the image shake-up will help change this.

Please take some time to vote in the new queue when you can: http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/new/

As always, this is dynamic and may change in future.

Disclaimer: rough summarization for the sake of brevity. Did my best to keep personal opinions out. Live version linked when studio ones were unavailable due to copyright issues

**Lucifer's heritage** - Promising teenagers figuring out how to put together Iron Maiden and german speed metal. Must listen: [Brian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aIDZzqM9Gg) - [Halloween](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1oALM4YPEw)

**Battalions of fear** - Quite rough, even for a debut. Still, there are glimps of what's to come. Must listen: [Majesty](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9WJh6ioEPQ) - [Run for the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTXsfX3RiCY)

**Follow the blind** - The step into the front row. By joining in for a song, Kai Hansen (by now a way more prominent figure than them) validates them as a top tier emerging act. Huge choirs start to figure as a main element throughout the songs. Must listen: [Valhalla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUlK3S_9IOo) - [Banish from sanctuary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB2umDrG4T0)

**Tales from the twilight world** - Stage two begins. While the backbone stays fast and heavy, the epic and the melodic step heavily in. First and notable attempt at going acoustic. As a side note, here is when Andreas Marschall - greatest metal cover artist of his time - enters the picture. Must listen: [Welcome to dying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QG7YEyV_KmE) - [Lord of the rings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2vehKsfHFE)

**Somewhere far beyond** - Sheer evolving. Heavy, acoustic, operatic and epic elements begin to be structurally blend together. Songs tend to include a bit of every element and to become longer and more structured. However, it's the simplest of them who will result to stand out. Great choice of bonus tracks, for putting together Satan and Queen is quite an intriguing way to have Blind Guardian in a nutshell. Must listen: [Time what is time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-AnYoiqo4Y) - [The bard's song (in the forest)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_tORtmKIjE)

**Imaginations from the other side** - Consecration. The trademark sound is fully developed, and a point of balance among all different elements has been found. Must listen: [Bright eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP49gxxBCzU) - [The script for my requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8Cxyd3VxbQ)

**The forgotten tales** - Funny, in that german fashion. Must listen: [Mr. Sandman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gq2LtmyjfLw) - [To France](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lze9qzaNPMY)

**Nightfall in middle-earth** - Stage three begins. Time for the magnum opus has come. Huge wait (three years are a lot in the late 90's), huge subject, huge perfectionism and attention to detail, huge tracklist. Huge everything, and it shows. Must listen: [Mirror Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AfNOKQdY-U) - [The curse of Feanor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFAskJN4YKE)

**A night at the opera** - Taking it further. Being impressive climbs the priority ladder and going boombastic here and there stops being a taboo. Arranging and production become a bigger part of the deal, and the results is unprecedented. Must listen: [Punishment divine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Cxp0KCqubk) - [And the there was silence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7tXYOAoLPM)

**A twist in the myth** - Where grandeur hits its peak. The epic and the cinematic elements take the lead and push the rest behind. For the first time, they encounter a mixed reception: lots of many fans won, some older ones upset. Must listen: [Another stranger me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rj-QLcJndg8) - [This will never end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZFrHdHoB44)

**At the edge of time** - Operation back to the roots: keeping it majestic while scraping away some cheese. Operation which, at least according to the general consensus, substantially succeeds. Must listen: [A voice in the dark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VfXoQCCizA) - [Curse my name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nElIA_ry-0s)",,False,,t5_2qhud,False,,,True,t3_1blxzq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1blxzq/guide_to_blind_guardian/,

You should be fucking banned if you post an Iron Maiden song. It's not that Iron Maiden is bad, it's killing this subreddit, and I really feel no need to come here anymore. I'll rarely find something I haven't heard here because it's not really worth clicking random links. People have to vote on them so we know what is worth checking out, and what is not. Just like every other subreddit.

That's all. Anyone know any good metal communities worth hanging out at?

Im shocked to see this got such a positive response, as I was convinced barely anyone would be interested in the music. Needless to say your words are quite inspiring, and I can't help but sound like a broken record by thanking you once again.

Edit: A little bit more speculation at the bottom of this story: http://www.metalinsider.net/bad-deals/update-randy-blythe-facing-5-10-years-in-prison

I'll just go ahead and guess that this means he's getting out! I'll keep this updated as more comes out though!

I haven't really listened to metal of any sort for about 6 years, and I definitely haven't been keeping up with the scene in some time.  Nevertheless, I instantly remembered the name when I saw the headlines; ""that was one of the main Slayer guys!"" I thought to myself.

Even though I haven't really been into metal in some time, I still felt bad for the guy.  I figured I should take a trip down memory lane that evening, so I dug out Reign in Blood and jammed out to it.

It was SUCH a good feeling.  I honestly had nearly forgotten the screeching guitar solos and absolutely relentless drumming.  It was so much fun to listen to, I went straight into Seasons of Abyss and enjoyed it just as much.  I couldn't help myself to keep going afterwards; that night, I relived all the old classics, from Metallica to Maiden to Motorhead.  And I fucking loved every second.

So I guess I just wanted to say that, for me at least, there was a bright side to Jeff's passing.  I fell in love with metal all over again, and I can't thank him ENOUGH for that.",,False,,t5_2qhud,False,,,True,t3_1dos41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1dos41/thank_you_jeff/,
1365113807.0,261,self.Metal,1box9l,Guide to Opeth,Jumpset,339,78,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1box9l/guide_to_opeth/,"I'm not entirely sure if we are doing this for blacklisted bands or not, but I liked the idea of posting guides to bands and I figured I'd do a guide to my all-time favorite band Opeth.

**Orchid** (1995) - The debut. This album features a sound that is heavily influenced by black metal in many places, but the key elements of Opeth's sound are already present in the incorporation of clean and melodic parts. It lacks the diversity of some of Opeth's records, but it is a great and interesting listen.

Must listen: [In The Mist She Was Standing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtasXTviObo) - [The Apostle in Triumph](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YG-mtaAAQE)

**Morningrise** (1996) - This album might be a difficult listen for some people. Its sound is rather raw in many places and the black metal influences are very noticeable. However, there are more acoustic elements than in Orchid and it seems a little less ""heavy"" in some places. A notable fact is that this album only features songs that last over 10 minutes, including Black Rose Immortal, which lasts 20:15.

Must listen: [Advent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9clLCHQKvsE) - [Black Rose Immortal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnCyXOTfsX4)

**My Arms, Your Hearse** (1998) - This release features a change in the band's sound. The black metal influences that were strong in the first two albums began to become less noticeable in this album and the music began to sound more death metal-esque. As a whole, this record sounds more aggressive and heavy than its predecessors. It was also the band's first concept album. It is notable that the average song length in this album is shorter than before, with all songs being shorter than 10 minutes, whereas the previous record *Morningrise* only featured songs which were above the 10 minute mark.

Must listen: [When](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3ZHajw3-3s) - [Demon of the Fall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrBrH5PZtcc) - [April Ethereal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf8PJvUpjog)

**Still Life** (1999) - This album is, in my opinion, Opeth's magnum opus. Musically, it can be described as more mellow  than *My Arms, Your Hearse*, but it is not less heavy. Overall, the sound of this album is different than the band's earlier works in that the acoustic parts became more prominent and the heavy parts became even more death metal-esque. With *Benighted* and *Face of Melinda*, it is the first Opeth record to feature multiple songs which do not have harsh vocals, with *Benighted* being a fully acoustic ballad.

Must listen: [The Moor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf7REF_qcxQ) - [Serenity Painted Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOPsS2rczL4) - [Face of Melinda](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGg155CcGKE)... Actually, just listen to the [whole thing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q13-BFr1GlA), it's worth it.

**Blackwater Park** (2001) - This album is regarded as Opeth's masterpiece by many. Musically, the sound is actually not that different from its predecessor *Still Life*, at least when compared to the style changes that the band underwent between previous releases. This album features Porcupine Tree frontman Steven Wilson on the keyboard and as a backing vocalist and producer. 

Must listen: [The Drapery Falls](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfslLWySZYg) - [Blackwater Park](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cb9C1u8HsR8) - [Harvest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqWdCRYEZGE)

**Deliverance** &amp; **Damnation** (2002/2003) - These two albums were meant to be a double album, thus I have listed them together. This double album deliberately divides the band's two stylistic traits, with *Deliverance* being a very heavy, death metal influenced record, and *Damnation* being completely clean and, essentially, a progressive rock album. However, even though these albums are meant to go together, both can be appreciated separately.

Must listen: [Deliverance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-PaT0Bgj-Y) - [Master's Apprentices](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G6PQLpNad8) -- [Windowpane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CvltVKjacw) - [In My Time of Need](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZixJQDgZrqA)

**Ghost Reveries** (2005) - This album's sound is rather interesting. It could be described as similar to *Deliverance*, but it sounds more atmospheric than previous Opeth releases. There is actually not much to say about this album, except that it is a great listen.

Must listen: [Ghost of Perdition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-AEolkRkj4) - [The Grand Conjuration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL3xWJxr_Sw)

**Watershed** (2008) - An album which marks a rather drastic change in the band's sound. The clean parts became even more influenced by progressive rock and more prevalent, while the heavier segments became a little ""chaotic"", which is a word which describes the album's sound pretty well, too. Overall, it is a very interesting record that is different from the others (and it is actually my least favorite Opeth album, but I'll leave the decision up to you).

Must listen: [Heir Apparent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbJCgDtjSDg)

**Heritage** (2011) - Now this is where it gets interesting. This album marks a complete departure from the band's previous sound, with the death metal influences disappearing completely and the complete absence of heavy, distorted riffs. This album actually sounds like a mixture of old-school progressive rock and Opeth's usual clean style, even incorporating jazz influences. The fact that it can barely be considered a metal record anymore caused some controversy among fans, but just because it is (very) different, this does not mean it is bad. I recommend listening to it - you don't have to like it.

I manage a female-fronted progressive metal band currently on tour, and long story short, our show for tomorrow fell through. With so little time to book another venue, and being hundreds of miles away from home, I'm turning to the collective intellectuals of this subreddit for help. If anyone knows of a venue/slot for tomorrow (Sunday May 26th) in Vegas, Arizona or Utah, please PM me. I don't want to mention the band name in the main post, (As this is not about plugging them), but I will include a link in comments and can send a press kit over to you at request. Drinks will be on us and sweet sweet merch loots will be yours. Thank you so much for your time everyone!

edit: Holy shit, 228 upvotes.  You are amazing, /r/metal.

Update:  Sadly, we ended up not being able to get a show.  It was too short notice in the end, but it was a valiant effort and we're grateful to the /r/metal community for just being rad and coming together for the good of the shred.

His name was Alex.  To be honest, I had never even heard of the band before that night.

The guy was a total douche nozzle though.  I've never seen such a horrid blend of uneducated idiocy, pleas for attention, and narcissism rolled into one.  After I told him that I hadn't heard of the band, he kept asking me if I had a smart phone so that I could google him, and then when I told him I didn't, he was desperately trying to show me pictures of him on stage in front of crowds.  When I said, ""that's cool man, good for you,"" he took personal offense and then tried to say that I had no taste in music and probably listened to shit.

Through the drunken conversations with my friends he eventually pretended to be an expert on American history and European geography, perhaps trying to look smart, spewing such asinine falsities that I couldn't help but pity him.

On the other hand, the next night (4th of July) we ran into this Canadian metal band called Tempest.  They pretended to appreciate our 4th of July celebration and shot the shit with us.  They were down to earth and cool as fuck.  So yeah, fame isn't everything.

EDIT: Just found out that these Tempest guys have their music online for free download.

Instead, I found a group of boring old dudes. Yesterday's front page: Alice Cooper, Overkill, Voivod, Sodom, Venom, and Vital Remains? Queensryche?

Today's: Darkthrone, Mayhem, Dismember and Ministry?

""First of all, thanks to everyone who has reached out in support of Randy and each of us in this terrible situation. It's noted and very much appreciated.

We have been keeping our heads down and not speaking out due to the fluid nature of the situation and the constantly changing information that even we receive daily.
Within an hour things can do endless 180's. It's maddening to try and make heads or tails.

We're taking the time to speak to you as it has been a significant period of time since this situation began and while nothing is immediately clear to any of us, we are not trying to keep anyone in the dark.

We have reached out and are making use of the resources we have acquired to help our brother who is still detained in Czech jail.

In the two years since, we were never notified of anything related to this incident.

Randy is our brother and we assure you, we are all staying very positive for him, working endlessly behind the scenes to provide any and all assistance possible.

The best we can do is to stay positive and continue to support our friend that we know is innocent.

We know that justice will prevail and we will continue to do our part to support our friend.

I had a few drinks last night and just woke up from a dream about how the moon was going to be destroyed by a meteor, thus destroying the Earth in the process. The only way to destroy this meteor was through sound waves for some reason. We needed the most amazing, loudest guitar solo imaginable. So, naturally, the citizens of Earth turned to me and I played the entire solo to Fermented Offal Discharge by Necrophagist.

Meteor breaks up speeding towards the moon.

World is saved.

Metal as fuck.

Pretty fucking awesome dream. Woke up feeling like a hard ass. Then I remembered that I can't even play guitar. Back to reality. =\

Second, I went with my wife, who doesn't care for metal, but wanted to make it a ""date night.""  Third, we didn't go into the pit, we stayed back by the bar.  *disclaimer* I've never heard any of the bands before except GWAR. 

Legacy of Disorder opened up, They were pretty good, was a very good front to the show.  They did a pretty good job at getting everybody amped up, even though at that point the mosh pit was lacking.  I don't normally enjoy the deep throat singing that seems prevalent in most metal, but there was something that made it seem just right.  

The Cancerbats were the second band up, and somehow they seemed to kill the mood.  The drummer didn't seem to keep an even beat, singer kept trying to tell the audience what to do, and nobody was doing it.  The guitar/bass were the best part about the band, and even they were pretty lackluster.  I really did not enjoy them at all and you'd have to pay me to get me to go back to one of their concerts. Honestly, they looked like they had started the after party the day before and were not planning on quitting.  I think their performance suffered because of it.  

Then there was DevilDriver... Holy shit, there was a world of difference between the two bands.  They got the audience amped back up very quickly and for the first time there was a good moshing going on.  Their songs were great, and they looked great performing.  If I had to rate all of the bands, I'ld say that Legacy of Disorder and DevilDriver were on par with each other.  


Then there was the headliner, GWAR.  The reason I went.  I had heard they put on a good show.  I must have misheard.  I was not prepared for the awesomeness that GWAR provided.  Pretty sure there was 6 executions, if not more.  Blood went everywhere, ejaculate, EVERYWHERE.  Some poor kid(looked 18ish) was crowdsurfing when Oderus released his kraken and took the first blast to the face.  He had the stream on him for probably 15-20 seconds straight.  He will be green for days.  
GWAR's costumes were more elaborate than I had thought.  There was minions running around swinging swords and jamming air guitar on the swords.  I absolutely Loved this concert.  I would gladly see GWAR again.  Also, my non-metalfan wife actually enjoyed this concert too.  We both loved GWAR and the show they put on.  If you have a chance to go to this tour, DO IT.

Arguably the first ever goblin metal band ever, NEKROGOBLIKON is pleased to announce the upcoming release of their brand new crusher of a record, Power, hitting stores on August 27, 2013. Power is produced by NEKROGOBLIKON, and is mixed by Matt Hyde (Deftones, Children of Bodom).

For a taste of what NEKROGOBLIKON is about, check out their recently released music video for the track ‘No One Survives’ (featuring Jon Lajoie of Comedy Central’s ""The League"" and adult entertainment star Kayden Kross), which went viral shortly after posting and already has 2 MILLION+ views. Check it out here: http://youtu.be/KsMKOx6fumc. The video is directed by Brandon Dermer, who has since shot a Major Lazer video, as well as the new Wavves video. Dermer had the chance to catch NEKROGOBLIKON performing in front of a small crowd of people at The Cobalt in Canoga Park, CA, immediately fell in love with the band, the rest is history. The video for ‘No One Survives’ ended up pulling in 1 million+ views in its first week of release.

Currently hailing from the grim metal locale of Los Angeles, CA, the band started as a summer side project of vocalist and keyboardist Nicholas Von Doom and guitarist and back-up vocalist Tim Lyakhovetskiy. Their debut album, Goblin Island, a musical hell-storm of goblin proportions, was recorded over the summer and early fall of 2006. They released it themselves on New Year’s Day of 2007.

NEKROGOBLIKON did the usual band-member musical chairs for a while, but their current line-up is both awesome and rad. After spending years playing numerous shows and honing their craft, they released their second full-length album, Stench (2011), which was produced by NEKROGOBLIKON with Zack Ohren at Castle Ultimate Studios and the Goblin Fortress.

NEKROGOBLIKON is proudly endorsed by Vic Firth, Halo Guitars and The Mountain Clothing. They recently appeared at several top-notch Euro festivals, including Download Festival, Rock Am Ring, Rock Im Park, etc.

1) My associates who are into other types of music predominantly are open to a lot of the metal that I expose them to, although they aren't nearly as into it as I am, but there's still a barrier to overcome with them.
2) My associates who are into metal are **not** into anything other than metal. They give this holier than thou attitude and refuse to listen to anything that doesn't take it to eleven.

It's frustrating because I think there's a lot of common ground musically. For example, the band Kinetik Control are an industrial metal pop extravaganza that straddles the line between metal and pop. I say pop because they have very melodic hooks that are designed to suck the listener in, and follow a very pop song structure (verse/chorus/verse/chorus/verse/holyshitamilisteningtoladagagawtfisthis). I enjoy them a lot for the tasty hooks, but was caught in a catch 22 for sharing. A metal friend accused them of being too non-kvlt for him, whereas a non-metal friend said they were too metal for him.

It's immensely frustrating because it's just fucking music, man. Get over whatever pretenses you have for metal and give it a listen. You might be surprised.

I'm just fed up with the attitude so many of my metal brähs give towards anything non-metal that's good. Like, good. And, naturally, the non-metal approach anxiety to anything that's abrasive.

Why can't we just like good fucking music and be done with it? Obviously your milage may vary, and I'm sure there's plenty of you who are in my camp. So I don't mean this as a catch-all *shreddit is so anti any thing not metal*, but I'm sure there's enough people who've experienced this dilemma that you know what I mean.

Even those of us with extensive metal backgrounds were only weaned on Black Sabbath. The nu-metal era was full of regrettable music, but made for a great stepping stone into our illustrious genre. No one has to be ashamed or apologetic for thinking Linkin Park or System of a Down were the hardest bands on the planet. What were you suppose to compare it to?

Also, you wouldn't be in r/metal if your tastes hadn't matured and you started listening to what would be considered respectable bands. Nothing that makes a positive enough of an impact that it will guide you into the world of metal is a negative thing. You'll probably be teased or thought of as unkvlt, metal's good points are equaled in elitism, but who cares? If you do care, listen to an Urfaust album until you become an appropriate vessel for Satan and maybe you'll feel differently when you're inhabited by the great deceiver.

So quit this former nu-metal fan apologism crap that I see in every nostalgia thread. I'd rather listen to Slipknot's laughable attempts at making ""accessible blackened death"" than to most of the garbage infecting Nashville radio right now.



EDIT: This really was suppose to be a ""I need to stop dwelling in the past because now I have Emperor and Testament"" thread as opposed to a ""Zero fucks given that I still listen to Papa Roach."" Meh. Let it all out, r/metal, it's all the same to me.

1334757450.0,206,self.Metal,sfzrx,Why I love Behemoth (and why you ALL need to see them live)! TLDR warning!,lilhand,263,57,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/sfzrx/why_i_love_behemoth_and_why_you_all_need_to_see/,"[http://lilhand.imgur.com/behemoth](http://lilhand.imgur.com/behemoth) pic album in advance

So I just saw Behemoth live in Kansas on Monday, this was the second time I'd been lucky enough to see em, the first being when they were at the free Ozzfest however long ago that was.  I had tickets for the tour after that but they understandably cancelled after Adam got diagnosed with Leukemia.  As we all know, he kicked the shit out of it.  This Monday they returned to my hometown and it was the best concert of my life! (even though what opening bands we saw were rubbish)

I made a shirt that said [ADAM : 1 Leukemia : 0](http://i.imgur.com/bp7El.jpg) (terrible pic, was caught off gaurd) and wore it to the show. I was bound and determined to get Adam to see the shirt.  We got there in time for the second bands last few songs.  Watain went on after and they were TERRIBLE in my mind.  I hadn't heard them before and from all the stage getup they had I REALLY wanted to like them but they just were not entertaining at all (but thats a whole separate post) then Behemoth went on.  

I worked my way up through the crowd and got right up on the railing. When the lights flashed on the crowd I lifted the shit up and made sure Adam could see it.  I noticed him reading it.  A few songs passed and then I took the shirt I made off (I had an undershirt on, I'm not the sweaty gross shirtless guy at the shows) and held it up in the air a few times.  I then reached it out to Adam and yelled take it and he briefly stopped shredding to reach out and grab my shirt.  He then proceeded to toss it to a crew member.  At this point I was fucking beaming.  He then looked at me and gave me a thumbs up of approval.  INSTANTLY best show ever.  At this point I'm just assuming the he took it because he is an incredibly awesome and well-spoken/nice dude and just wanted to make a fans day, which he did!  I figured it would end up left at the venue or something along those lines... but I didn't give a shit! HE TOOK MY SHIRT, SMILED, AND ACKNOWLEDGED ME WITH APPROVAL. Game over man, game over.... The rest of the show I was on cloud 9... no fuck that, I was on cloud 17.  

So I get home roughly and hour and a half or so after the show is over and my fucking jaw is hurting from smiling so much and just having an absolute fucking blast.  I hop on their Facebook page because some bands post shit about their previous show and I was hoping to see something on there, but alas, nothing.  That didn't fucking matter though, for some reason I knew that he kept the shirt.

Out of sheer curiosity I decided to reload their FB page in the morning.  [HOLY FUCK! ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!](http://i.imgur.com/31YS3.jpg) Adam actually took a picture of MY SHIRT, well now HIS SHIRT, and posted it on their fucking [facebook page!](http://www.facebook.com/behemoth) Goosebumps covered my entire fucking body! They are again as I'm typing this.

Thank you Nergal, Orion, Inferno, and Seth.  Thank you Behemoth.  Thank you for blowing my fucking mind with your awesome performance, and thank you for understanding how a simple gesture can create a memory that I will have with me for the rest of my life.  Please do yourself a favor and go see Behemoth. You deserve it, and so do they.

EDIT : Adam [posted](http://i.imgur.com/AIhcV.jpg) on his official page as well. AND its even MORE badass!  I replied to him and put the link to this post on it.  Would be AMAZING if he read it!

We'll be manning the computer from 8pm-10pm EST, so post some questions and we'll be around to answer soon. But first, a little background on our band for you:

We are a female fronted power metal band from Deland Florida. We formed back in 2007, and have since released 3 albums (Tuesday is the release of our 3rd, ""The Fire Is Mine"" [(Pre Order Here)](http://www.amazon.com/The-Fire-Mine-Seven-Kingdoms/dp/B008V0OM2S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1347896479&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=seven+kingdoms)! 

Our members include:

Sabrina Valentine - Vocals

Camden Cruz - Guitar

Kevin Byrd - Guitar

Keith Byrd - Drums

Aaron Sluss - Bass

Our band has done a lot of awesome stuff, and Camden is even a local area music promoter. We've played the pre-show of [ProgPower USA](http://www.progpowerusa.com), have opened for [Blind Guardian](http://www.blind-guardian.com), and have even done a successful mini-tour with independant bands put together by our management crew [Intromental!](http://www.intromental.com) 

Get familiar with some of our stuff on [Spotify too](http://open.spotify.com/artist/0PMYvG0U25tgSi8jQExPAC)!

Aside from that, we also released and premiered our video for ""After The Fall"" from our new album at Progpower, and have over 345,000 views so far. 

You can [check it out on youtube.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hpa6f6s23PE)

We're hoping to be able to shed some light on what it's like being in a band that's trying so hard to make it as a band and what it's like to be involved in the music industry. And also to promote our album. Fire away! 

**EDIT:** Well we're way past our scheduled time but who gives a shit! We're still around answering questions and the like, so keep them coming but don't get discouraged if we don't get to you right away, we will answer everyone!

http://www.bt.no/bergenpuls/--Hvor-ble-det-av-politiet-2737722.html

http://www.ba.no/puls/article6157240.ece

And now, for some introduction...

My band had prepared for months a gig where we just headed straight to town with a generator and our equipment, and then just started playing out of nowhere.

Today, our plan succeded.

Followed by a shitload of preparation, a shitload of cash, and a shitload of patience, and a bigger load of luck, we executed it perfectly and better than we could hope.

Earlier this day, I was sleeping at our rehearsal-place, being woken up by the vocalist. Followed by a few cigarettes, we started packing everything into the van that is seen behind us. The entire band drove to a seemingly deserted place to test our outdoor-sound. It was splendid, until a woman who we had apparently disturbed yelled at us. We packed our shit, drove to Bergen town, and parked the transportation car while the van parked at the heart of Bergen, the blue stone. We put on our morph suits (to remain anonymous) and walked through town both scaring and entertaining people.

We proceeded to the van, threw out our shit and prepared.

When all was set, our vocalist had a little peptalk with the shocked 50 people enjoying a summer day. We started playing, and by the end of the gig, over 200 people were watching. They cheered.

When we were done, we packed our shit again and left. Now, we're on the news.

Let me translate the first one briefly:

Headline: - Where's the police?

*We had expected the police to stop this gig before it even started.* said the frontman.

Then they wrote about our planning stage (we were interviewed), our age (from 17 -me- to 36 -frontman-), our nicknames (we were anonymous) and whatnot.

A quote from our vocalist saying it's about peace and love, and making people smile.

Another quote from an old spectator: Fuck off, cowardly fools!

Some info about how unexpected it was, how some loved it while others hated it, etc.


And that pretty much sums up the other article too. Use google translate and set it to Norwegian if you wanna read a poor version. Any questions?

**Try to post in the same format**: Band name - Song name, adding a link would also be great.

**Don’t repost bands** if you already see it in the comments, just upvote the existing post, or comment on it saying how freaking awesome it is.

**Don’t downvote bands just because you don’t like them**, just upvote those you do. Someone else might enjoy them.

**Only post one band**, if a band hasn't been mentioned after a few hours you can always come back and post it later.

I chose heavy metal.

I talked about the history of metal, why and how I got into the music back in high school, what it means to me, and even debunked some stereotypical myths about metalheads.  I even played a video sampling songs to show the diversity of the genre, which included Stratovarius, Yngwie Malmsteen, Testament, Megadeth, and Rainbow.

This is what my emailed me after class:

""(My name)! I wanted to catch you in private before you left class today, you did the very best Who Am I? presentation in either class. It was simply outstanding! You earned an unadulterated ""A"" here!""

I sat back, smiled, and listened to The Electric Age for the 100th time like a good boy.

TL;DR: I gave a presentation about metal to people who didn't care about the music beforehand, blew their minds, and my teacher gave me an ""unadulterated"" A.

1311935678.0,186,self.Metal,j33t1,Tales from a military gym. I had to share this with you all :),DocLefty,282,96,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/j33t1/tales_from_a_military_gym_i_had_to_share_this/,"So I am in the military on a ship, currently operating in/around Africa (just keep reading - it gets better) and we have a gym on-board. Since we are in Africa and there is not fuck-all to do, pretty much the entire crew works out at least twice a day. We have a sound system consisting of some giant speakers (I don't know what the fuck they are exactly but they can crank some noise well). Everyone who comes down to work out usually hooks their ipod up to the MP3 jack and cranks whatever they have. Unfortunately it usually varies from Linkin Park to Disturbed (If you're a fan then I apologize but I cant stand these 2 shit-brake bands) and 3OH3, G-unit, rap/rock etc... basically terrible generic music that predominates in every military gym. Well the iPod they were using apparently shorted out yesterday because of a heavy sweater and they did not have tunes. I offered to hook mine up but told them it is all metal and the like, and they probably would not dig it. They sounded like they were all for it anyways and they tell me anything is better to work out to than silence.

Within 10 seconds there is the sweet, sweet sound of Shadows Fall coming out at 1 million decibels. The other people look at me with a look of combined horror/disgust and proceed to work-out/run/lift weights. I think they went with it since they assumed the next song up would be something more mainstream/chill? Well, the next beautiful symphony was courtesy of At the Gates, followed by Lamb of God, and then some Killswitch, AILD, ATR, and of course my personal fave Unearth. After about 15-20 minutes one of the guys walks up and asks me: ""What...what the fuck is this shit? I can't understand the words to a lot of it but it makes me want to beat the shit out of someone."" I told him that in addition to being actual great music from actual musicians, it had the side effect of making workouts MUCH more productive. I figured that was the first - and last - time I would be asked to provide tuneage for the gym. So this was yesterday. 

Fast forward to today and I am down in the gym with my headphones in. Someone else hooks up their iPod and starts playing some Yellow Card (NOT a bad band IMHO but not work-out tunes by a fucking long shot). Within a few minutes I have about 12 people ask me to hook my ipod up, because they really dig that ""really fast crazy shit"" I had on yesterday. In addition, they also want to rape my iPod for all of my metal I have. I think I just converted 14 or 15 people to good music. Dumb story I know but I had to share because I got a laugh out of it :) There is nothing better than when people listen to a metal song and look at you and say ""I didn't even know humans could play that fast, this is fucking unreal!"" 

EDIT: I realize that none of the bands I listed previously are death or black metal. I can't work out to Cattle Decapitation or Children of Bodom or the like, I gotta have some melody in there if I'm working out. Plus, as stated by a couple people in the comments, I don't think introducing someone to Metal would work if I used black/death metal. 

EDIT #2: Tomorrows Gym line-up will be: Slayer, Behemoth, Amon Amarth, In Flames, Arch Enemy, and The Nuclear Blast All-Stars compilation album.

Not generally my type of music, but I am always looking for content for my website.  Doors opened at 5, I arrived at 6 at the Glasshouse in Pomona.  First band I see I didn't bother getting a name; bad.  Two singers screaming into the mic.  Next band up is Within the Ruins.  I film some footage from up against the stage then wanted to get some crowd shots of the last two songs.  I stood behind a dude and felt safe.  When I am shooting video, I am basically blind as my left eye is closed, right eye is on the viewfinder.  I shoot death metal, black metal, and thrash all the time so this pussy shit didn't bother me much. 
I'm shooting some b-roll of the band and all of the sudden hardcore kicking all over the place. A dude throws and elbow at the guy I am behind.  I open my eyes and pull the video camera down a little as the guy starts to take a swing.    All of the sudden, 5 guys tackle the dude and I go down too.  The people just start punching me and/or kicking me in the face and body.  I'm afraid they are going to try to steal my video gear so protecting that is my main concern.  Seconds later security pulled the dudes off me and the other guy and ejected them.  
I don't cover metalcore, but I thought this shit went on at hardcore shows only?  Also where is the respect?  I film from inside some epic thrash and death metal pits and get knocked around a lot. If I drop, always someone to pick me up.  
Anyways, I thought I had a broken nose, but was just bloody and sore.  I do have one cracked rib though which makes sitting here working very enjoyable.

Everything has 6 upvotes, presumably from the same 6 people circlejerking.  I suppose there's nothing wrong with a bunch or metal links filling the subreddit for a day.  The other day it was old school death.  Whatever.  The issue is that for whatever reason it completely takes over my front page leaving maybe 20 assorted links and 70+ fucking thrash metal youtube links.  I tried hiding them and then refreshed.  BOOM! 30 more fucking links.

You guys are fucking up the front page for anyone subscribed to r/metal.  I don't want to unsub, but I'll have to unless this is addressed.  There's a lot of good content in here (some of the time anyway), but when it fucks up the rest of the site...

EDIT - To clarify.  I'm not against posting these links.  I like a lot of them.  My default reddit page (that has my subs, not the default bullshit) when I hopped on earlier was 80/100 thrash metal spam.  I really enjoyed the metal A-Z threads we had a few months ago and found a bunch of great bands I hadn't heard of (Xanthochroid for example).  Those threads were unobtrusive and didn't fuck up the rest of reddit for me.

r/metal's spirit is in the right place, but a lot of you are acting like children (look at some of the replies to this).  All I'm asking for is a little organization.

1365157154.0,177,self.Metal,1bq43s,Guide to Emperor,Barnaby_Fuckin_Jones,218,41,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/1bq43s/guide_to_emperor/,"Emperor were a black metal band from Norway who formed in 1991 and were a prominent force during 2nd wave of black metal in the mid-nineties.  Through the years, Emperor have since become legendary in the black metal community and for good reason.  Here we'll take a look at their 4 full length albums.

**In the Nightside Eclipse** (1994) - Regarded by many as one of the greatest black metal albums ever released, *In the Nightside Eclipse* is a symphonic black metal masterpiece, in my opinion.  The low-fi production coupled with the buzz saw guitar, echoey drums, and almost negligent bass create a ""wall of sound"" that is typical of black metal at the time but what really brings out the melody and songwriting are the heavy use of symphonic keyboards.  The keys create this epic, romantic and somber feeling that can take you to another world (at least for me it does).  This album is definitely the simplest in terms of musicianship but the songwriting from Ihsahn more than makes up for any perceived deficiency in that area.  Also, *Inno a Satana* gives us our first glimpse at Ihsahn's clean vocals.

Must listen: [Into the Infinity of Thoughts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tccZs_veliA), [Towards the Pantheon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cndZYrNaaE4), [I Am the Black Wizards](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgQRRI9goFg), [Inno a Satana](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PvYoCVAgFg)

**Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk** (1997) - Emperor really amps up the musicianship on this one.  I would say that this album is *In the Nightside Eclipse* on steroids.  We see a newcomer in the band, Trym, who replaces Faust on drums (Faust was sent to prison for murder).  Trym has a much different style than Faust.  More use of blastbeats and bouble bass.  I believe he is also a more accomplished drummer as well which fits nicely with the more technical songwriting present here.  Also, the keyboard synth has become more varied.  Instead of the typical vocal ""ahhs"" which were much more prevalent on the first album, we hear more strings and brass.  The production irks me a bit as I feel the vocals are too low in the mix and the bass drum is too high in the mix but that may be personal preference.  Ihsahn puts more of his clean vocals on display here.

Must listen: [The Loss and Curse of Reverence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BI4_NMxPb8), [The Acclamation of Bonds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wawEA4g4Kw), [With Strength I Burn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRyyGCmXffo)

**IX Equilibrium** (1999) - With this album the songwriting has become more varied.  Also, more space is given to the riffs and melodies as this album does not employ the typical ""wall of sound"" approach found on the first two albums.  I would say the guitar style has changed from the typical black metal style riffage of fiercely strumming full chords as rhythm with tremolo picked single notes as lead to create a melodic structure, to more of a thrash style use of power chords.  Ishahn also brings in more clean vocals, especially on *An Elegy of Icaros* and the synth seems more upfront.  Many would say this is their weakest album, but there are some great tracks.

Must listen: [Curse You All Men!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sHCCaP0dAE), [Sworn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSrJ7WvszZk), [Nonus Aequilibrum](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1i4jOYlkZk)

**Prometheus - The Discipline of Fire &amp; Demise** (2001) - Emperor's final album and boy is it a doozy (I mean this in a good way, of course).  First thing you notice is the production is top-notch on this album.  Like, night and day compared to the previous 3 albums.  You could see this as a bad thing but actually it really brings out all the melodies and nuances from the guitar parts.  The keyboard synth sound, in terms of replicating real instruments, is far and away better than the previous albums.  We see the use of brass, strings and even some harpischord &amp; electronic sounds throughout.  This album is also Emperor's most technical and Ihashn and Samoth both employ 7-string guitars on this.  Don't worry, the 7-strings aren't used to chug-a-lug through the songs but are used appropriately.  Also, it is important to note that every Emperor album has had roots in classical music but this album in particular is seething with classical influence and bombast.  It's quite amazing to see how much Emperor has transformed over the years to get to this point and to be their final album and go out on something this magnificent is truly remarkable.

Must listen: [The Eruption](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QeW-tyRbl8), [In the Worldless Chamber](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X6ZFm948XQ), [The Tongue of Fire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCPoYEbWc7U), [Thorns on My Grave](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt6TDAys040)

I hope you all enjoyed my guide.  I really enjoyed doing this as I am a huge fan of Emperor.

We all enjoy joking around and having a good time, but our songs sing about very serious topics (and we would like people to appreciate that as much as possible). How much middle-ground do you guys think there is?

I have an example:
The reason I made this: we made a [kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1165939595/the-death-march-begins), which we shot to look funny, but how much before we lose legitimacy as a 'serious' band? Obviously I enjoyed ""Walk With Me in Hell"" by Lamb of God, because they are a group of funny guys, and I could still take them seriously because of how the music side and the personal side are held apart, but they're a national act where you HAVE to take them seriously.

tl;dr- What do you guys think of ""funny"" metal bands? If a band is completely serious on stage and are joking around off stage does it make the stage persona look like an obvious act, or is there room to be both?

Also a big disclaimer: ""Funny"" is a very broad word. If you watch the kickstarter, it could very well NOT be funny to you, I don't want to claim we're all professional comedians, but it's the idea that I'm trying to get across.",,False,,t5_2qhud,False,,,True,t3_16udhm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/16udhm/canshould_a_metal_band_be_funny/,
