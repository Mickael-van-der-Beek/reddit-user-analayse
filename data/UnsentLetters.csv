I am sorry for the torture, the late night talks where my thoughts leaked from between my fingers, trickling drops of brain matter; you were shoved into a river without knowing how to tread water.      
  
I have a confession.    
It was me.    
I pushed you.        

    
I apologize for wanting desperately to be loved by someone, for taking your care and wrapping it up for myself as if it were my birthday and admiration my present. I wanted to feel accepted. You're kind and rarely judgmental. I don't deserve the relationship I have with you.      
    
You're not a creep and no, you're not a bad person, either. Quit saying it. *Quit thinking it*. You're beautiful and human, full of life and spirit you don't realize you possess and it makes me sad to watch you struggle while I selfishly cling to our friendship. You're my raft and I need you like the air I breathe.    
    
Sometimes I lay awake in bed with night bent over my body, dark encroaching my private space, and wish I could have loved you romantically...but we don't fit that way. You're sudoku and I'm a crossword. So we're both puzzles, yeah. But we can't be filled out in the same manner.    
    
I wish I could lead you in the right direction. If only I knew the perfect someone to introduce and complete that bit of you that thinks I'm it, but I know deep down you're still searching because you can feel we just aren't right.    
    
Please don't jump off the cliff just because it's there; you see a giant, but I know you're only looking at the shadow. It's not as big or scary as you think.

I was trying on every single pair of shoes. Heels, sandals, boots. Whatever caught my fancy. While other women navigated around me, glaring and judging, you did not. 

Instead, you strolled by casually, stared down at a pair of pink flats I was trying on, and you said with sincerity: ""Everything in here looks fantastic on you--how cute!"" 

You have no idea what those words meant to me. Growing up, I never had a mother to tell me what looked good and what didn't. No one dressed me up and instead I wore my older brother's hand-me-downs. No one showed me how to groom myself. No one told me I was pretty, or that I was cute. No one sat me down to tell me that boys can sometimes be silly and that heartbreak can only ever be temporary.

You must remember when she forgets. 

You lose her when you don’t notice that she notices everything about you: your use of the proper punctuation that tells her continuation rather than finality, your silence when you’re about to ask a question but you think anything you’re about to say to her would be silly, your mindless humming when it is too quiet, your handwriting when you sign your name in blank sheets of paper, your muted laughter when you are trying to be polite, and more and more of what you are, which you don’t even know about yourself, because she pays attention.

She remembers when you forget. 

You lose her for every second you make her feel less and less of the  beauty that she is. When you make her feel that she is replaceable. She wants to feel cherished. When you make her feel that you are fleeting. She wants you to stay. When you make her feel inadequate. She wants to know that she is enough and she does not need to change for you, nor for anyone else because she is she and she is beautiful, kind and good.

You must learn her. 

You must know the reason why she is silent. You must trace her weakest spots. You must write to her. You must remind her that you are there. You must know how long it takes for her to give up. You must be there to hold her when she is about to. 

You must love her because many have tried and failed. And she wants to know that she is worthy to be loved, that she is worthy to be kept.

    And, this is how you keep her.

(NSFW x-post from /r/rapecounseling )",NejKidd,94,16,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1bsspa/i_forgot_im_sorry_nsfw_xpost_from_rrapecounseling/,"Oh yea, I get it now, I'm sorry.  It's just your joke just made me think of something else, so I didn't get it at first.

You know, I wish you had been there when it all happened, to explain to me why it was funny.  I wish you'd seen the bruises on the side of my face the next day from where he had pushed my face into the wall while he shoved his dick into me so forcefully that I screamed.  So he grabbed the back of my neck and slammed my cheek into the wall to daze me into silence.  If you saw those bruises then you'd see the real funny side of it.

Or perhaps you would be able to explain the joke in the 3 hours I spent alone, unable to find my friends who were in the nightclub still, terrified of the guy finding me again.  Perhaps if you'd watched as I shook and flinched on that bench, you'd know why I didn't laugh that first time when you'd told the joke.

And how you would have laughed, if you'd heard how, when I spoke for the first time about what had happened to me, my male best friend laughed and said 'yea, right.  That didn't happen, I know what you're like.'  Wouldn't that be hilarious?  Imagine how I felt, that the person who was supposed to know and care for me the most implied that it was my fault that someone followed me, pinned me down, stripped me and then asked me for a tissue to wipe their cum off their dick once they were done.  It was hilarious, I understand now, thanks to you.

But it's not a big deal, I understand.  I'm overreacting, I need to calm down.  I'm being hysterical, I'm being a bitch for not allowing you to joke about something you find funny.  I'm being a typical crazy female who's intruding on your world, I don't understand your lad culture and therefore my opinion doesn't count.

I mean, it's not possible that you need to grow up.  You and your friends, because it's not only you that I take offence to.  Every time you make a joke, and they laugh without confronting you about it, they make it okay for you to make that joke.  It kills me inside every time, because my boyfriend is one of them.  Each time they make it okay for you to make the joke, they make the behaviour funny, they make it acceptable - the joke and the situation it's based on.

I think that's what makes me most angry.  Above anything else, it's that mindset that riles me.  The idea that the only thing that's keeping a man from touching a girl, sticking your dick in her, doing to her what was done to me, is what she's wearing, that's what makes me sick.  The less she's wearing, the more likely you are to touch her, it's her fault she got touched, got raped, because she chose those clothes.

The only thing standing between any and every man in our society becoming a beast, driven by their sexual needs, willing to take forcefully what isn't given freely, is some thin slip of material that a woman chooses to wear or not to wear.  That's what you're saying, when you say 'she was asking for it', 'she deserved it', 'she needed to be brought down a peg'.  You're saying that.

If men can't be trusted to behave like rational human beings because they can see a bit more flesh on a woman, then they do not deserve to be part of a civilized society.

And women are the weaker sex?

The night I was attacked I was wearing jeans, converses, a shirt, and a thick scarf, just so you know.  I'd slept with 2 men at that time, both in committed, long term relationships.  I'd never kissed a stranger on a night out.  I'd never even worn a mini-skirt!  That man took what he wanted, and tossed me away like a rag.  Sometimes it's not about the expectation of being treated like a lady, most of the time it's more about the expectation of being treated like a human being.

So when you laugh at a girl being harassed because of her clothes.  Or call a girl a bitch or a slut because she won't kiss you.  I understand the joke now.  The joke is that you can do whatever you want, stick your fingers wherever you desire, grab whatever you want, and I have to understand that it's because I deserve it for having boobs.

But finally! I quit my job, sold the house at a loss, moved to a place that I swore I'd never live, found a job in a field where there are a minimal amount of jobs, and we had all kinds of sweet, simple plans and a beautiful fresh start at everything in life. (His love was worth every thing and more. I would do it again in a second.) We didn't want anything fancy, just to take trips and listen to music and enjoy our days together. We were happy. Ecstatic just to be together - no matter the place or circumstance. We finally got to fall asleep and wake up together. Was that too much to ask?

We didn't know that you were there hanging out, twiddling your thumbs, and then finally raging like a wildfire. That you'd been there for years causing all kinds of problems that were attributed to other things. Fuck you, you insidious, invisible piece of shit. And I mean f.u.c.k.y.o.u. 
You made us so paranoid. So jealous of anyone around us who had a reason to smile. You took our amazing, amazing sex life. You robbed us of our late night conversations and inside jokes and memories, past, present, and those to come. You turned meals into a nightmare with your let's-make-everything-taste-like-shit trick. You turned a vigorous, strong man into a shell of a person who couldn't lift his head off the pillow or even find the strength to sip from a straw. You took him to unspeakable places of pain and fear and stripped away all his dignity. You showed us the horrible side of the doctors. You emptied our bank account. You made people shy away because they didn't know what to do or say. You alienated our families. You made me watch him take his last breath as he laid in my arms. You took my beautiful man and you zipped him into a black bag (thanks for the big scratch left in the wall from the funeral home stretcher, too - I love seeing that every day) and then you put him into the cold, cold ground. I go to the cemetery everyday because of you; instead of running home and jumping into his arms. We had a love unlike any other and you just couldn't stand it, could you? Happy now? Enjoying the fact that I cannot sleep? That I can barely make it through the work day? Digging my depression? Fuck you. Bet you love the fact that I am surrounded by all his things and I cannot even touch them for fear I will completely lose my mind. 

Cancer, you are a liar, a thief, a bully, a monster, and the most vile beast. I cannot believe you were there every time we kissed. You invited yourself along on all of our trips. That you eavesdropped on all of our conversations. That you lurked in our home, just waiting to claim him for yourself. You stole him from me and I will never forgive you. Oh, I have accepted you...I have accepted that I loathe you, you rat bastard. I hate the industry you have created. I hate the people that profit from you. I watch the families you destroy. I see myself, a woman in her prime, that is now afraid of her own shadow and incapable of ever feeling joy again.
I. Hate. You.

You got what you came for, now go away and leave me alone.

I guess this letter will be ""sent"", but considering maybe twenty people will read this, half of which who will downvote it, it really doesn't matter. For all it matters, it's just you and me. 

Things just aren't fun anymore. I came here for cute pictures and fun facts and I'm leaving a worse person than I was. I stumbled upon reddit and lurked for a while, but joining was a different game. I thought that maybe it was me, but I realize that it was you, not you personally, but the users. 

See, everyone tells you about how the community always helps each other. That everyone is so nice and sweet. But they don't tell you about the ugly and the hate. It's always there, a shadow on every post. People have no fear here, but they also have no shame, dignity, or guilt. I've seen people tear each other apart. Break people down. I've seen the true ugly of people come out. 

We want to pretend that there's mods and there's rules, but it's all does mean a thing. People get so caught up here, in this microcosm, threatened by people that don't know for titles and petastools that don't even exist. 

I was naive. I thought you were a cornicopia of knowledge, an open society free of judgment. Quite frankly, this is the most judgmental place ever. So closed minded. People complain about closed communities, sheltering people from truth, well this is factory for misinformation and hate. And who do we hate? Fat people? Women? Conservatives? No, we hate ourselves most of all. 

I'm leaving here because I realized how cynical and harden I've become. I've fed into this hate machine and only woke up when I was placed on stage to be observed and judged. Just like we do to everyone else. I won't feed into this anymore. This mentality is disturbing. The fact that people defend it, unforgivable. People complain about something becoming a circlejerk, this whole thing is just one giant one!

I'm not the person I used to be before I joined. I'm bitter, angry, misinformed, selfish, greedy, judgmental, and depressed. I don't want to go back to who I was. I want to be better than I've ever been. I know what I can become, but I've seen the light and I'm leaving you behind. I thought that I could change this place, change these people, and all I've done is changed myself into something I hate. The world's not beautiful any more. I always knew there was ugly, but this shoved it down my throat until I can no longer swallow. My campaign is done. 

I know there are users out there, subreddits out there, they hold fast onto this utopia. May you one day find it here. Maybe things can be changed by people like you.

You've meant so much to me over the last few months I've gotten to know you. I really think you are wonderful and it kills me when you don't believe me. I need to tell you a few things and it might as well be here.

I've been falling in and out of love with you like my heart was made of clockwork that runs on your smile. I know you don't believe me when I say you have a spark of perfection but I can see it when your lips draw back into a crimson crescent.

You laugh and say I'm sweet but the truth is that you put me at ease like no one else. I'm not what we'd call socially capable. Around you I'm more clever, more articulate, more... everything I want to be. It's as if you grant me the ability to step out of the humanish shell of machinery that I've constructed to fool people into thinking I'm normal. The pistons pushing out rehearsed quips of quirky dialogue slow, the false construct grinds down to a halt, the spinning, searching windows I look through come to rest focusing only on you and the genuine man underneath steps forward. You do it so naturally I don't think it's conscious. That's part of why you are so exceptional. The warmth of your heart beats into me, your eyes blink and overlook all of my flaws, and you make me feel like prince charming without a thought.

You deny and dismiss my compliments, responding that your body isn't what I see in those magazines in the supermarket checkout line. You recently told me that you were recovering from an eating disorder and it scares me that you can't learn to see in yourself what is apparent to everyone else. 
You are beautiful.

I didn't tell you what I should have. All I said was, ""you can't live your life worrying what other people think of you."" While that is true, it's not the thing I should have said. 

Truth is lately I've been feeling like you do. Maybe not in the exact same way, but I can tell you it's been pretty hard to keep my head up lately. I wake up everyday and there's rejection letters from companies for positions I've applied to. I told my best friend that for 2 years I've had some hard feelings for her, and I don't think she feels anything serious enough to pursue any relationship with me other than the one we have. For the past 3 months I've felt purposeless. I feel like I've wasted the past 4 years of my life in something that might not yield anything and I can't even say I enjoyed it that much. Sometimes I feel like giving up too…

But I'm not going to. And the reason is because I know there's some kid just like you who's going through some tough shit and keeps wondering if it's all worth it in the end. I can't give up because I'd be letting people who feel like that down all over the world. I just want you to know that you're not alone, and that there is someone like you right now that's in a dark place and refuses to give up.

I'm going to make it. I don't know if it'll be 3 months from now, a year, or a whole damn decade. But I do know there is going to be a point in my life  where I am good and happy and everything is truthfully ok. And I'm not doing this just for me but I want it so I can show people that it is possible for hard times to end and good things can happen to people if they just choose to stick it out a little longer, and I want to show people that being an underdog doesn't mean that you don't have any place in this world. And maybe next time you feel like you just can't go on you'll remember that there's someone who is no different from you trying to make life work out, and when you do I hope you find the strength to push a little harder.

I don't know if I'll ever shop around for names, fill my cart with canned confusion and boxes of pre-necessitated worries instead of tomato soup and cereal. It almost makes me sad.

When my bedroom is the right temperature, after I've been subjected to subpar sleep, I wonder what sort of person you'd be. I ask myself if your brain would have holes in it like mine, your emotions leaking out, blotting pages of your life that could've been perfect and beautiful if you'd been born with all the pieces together correctly.

...but I'm terrified that I'll come home after work, peek into your bedroom and see you curled up in bed, defeated and in tears, hiding from me because you don't think I could ever understand your emotions or help fill in the potholes you fall in just because.

I don't want you to be a beautiful, tortured mass of feeling. I know that sometimes that's what being human means, but I don't want to be responsible for how hurt you will feel when the sun doesn't shine bright enough or the clouds are the wrong shape.

I'm not extensively worried about hemming your pants, cooking you dinner, or discovering you've already had your first kiss. I can learn.

I admit I was being an asshole when I responded with ""I'm dating somebody else."" To be honest, I thought it was the right move instead of expressing what I truly felt for you when I have no intentions of taking our friendship any further. 

I just wish I was able to explain myself then and offer a concrete reason why I couldn't be romantically involved with you. There were things about me that I didn't let you know, and I wish had. 

During the times when I'd go MIA, I couldn't face anyone because I was ashamed of my depression and anxiety problems. I didn't think people would understand and harshly judge me. Not that I think you would, I just didn't feel comfortable telling it to other people. That was the time when I met my ex-boyfriend. He met me at a very low point in my life and I just felt secure for once. That I didn't have to put up a front of being normal. He made me feel that someone accepts and understands all of me, good and bad. This is primarily the reason why I kept coming back to him. 

I did try to entrust you with something. You knew a very delicate matter that happened to me. But I was scared you'd throw it at my face if ever we do get in a relationship. I was afraid we'd fight a lot and I'd just fuck everything up and hurt you. I didn't want you to get mad at me. I didn't want you to hate me. Being friends with you felt safe. It made me feel secure that we'd never breakup. It felt like I could keep you forever. I realize that I had selfish motivations but that was how much I wanted and needed you. 

I've never had good male role model when I was growing up and I felt really happy that I found it in you. I've always wanted to have an older brother because I never had one. I wanted to know how it felt like there's someone looking out for me. I've realized that this was more important than having you as a boyfriend because I found a best friend and a brother. Somehow I thought that sex would ruin that perfect image I have of you. 

Even if we didn't get together, I don't want to regret my decision. I just want to say sorry because I should've handled it better. You deserve someone stable, someone who could make you happy and start a family with. 

Remember the time you asked me if you would be enough if you were my boyfriend? I instantly cried that night because I knew you would perfect. I just felt like I didn't deserve you. I'm sorry for whining constantly about the guys I dated. It must have hurt. Somehow, I wish I was sensitive enough to have felt it. 

All those times you were mentioning about being friendzoned, I pretended it wasn't about us. I wanted to believe you've moved on and has accepted that what we had was perfectly platonic. I still want to believe that. I never really had a guy friend, you know. I wanted to believe that once upon a time, a guy who purely liked me. I still believe that's you. Because in my mind you're still perfect and nothing will ever manage to tarnish that.

I'll be honest, I hate my life here, I took everything for granted before. When you said I had place in your home whenever I needed it, I desperately wanted to just say ""Well here I come!"", grab a plane ticket and we could be brothers.

I took a shower and I could not stop wondering what it is you are doing, where you are, if we have ever met...and if you feel the same heavy, cavernous hole in your chest that I do.
     
     

Does it feel like it is eating you from the inside out?
     
     

Did it start in the back of your aching mind, slowly creep into the pit where your heart should be, the cavity that is your stomach, and crawl as if it were ivy toward your toes?     
          
     

Are you piling food into your empty chest to fill it up when you can't quite take the crippling bareness?
    
    

That's what I often do. When I feel especially used, spent on nothing and no one, I eat...but the acid in my belly gurgles, bubbles, turns its way up my pipes and cleans out the matter. I need something stronger.
      
      

It's not as simple as medication. I can't down cough syrup or swallow pills to fix the bruised space in this body. You know what I mean. It hasn't worked for you either. At best it numbs, only shallow, temporary relief that cannot cure the absence of this great something we are searching for.

...but I am not here to widen the ravine.
    
     

We are not made of endless abyss.
     
     

Let's make an agreement, right here and right now. Let us pour persons into all the upset crevices.     
      
It will help.
      
      

Let's fall in love with strangers because they are alive, with the quilting on our bed spreads because they cover us, and our own hands because they exist.
       
     

It is a difficult covenant to keep, but I think we are both capable, beautiful people. It can be done.
     
    

And if we stumble, let's make a point to pick each other up. I will be here for you, and you will be there for me.

1339091054.0,41,self.UnsentLetters,uq33h,an open letter to all that speak of depression as though you're fucking her in your spare time.,pyrelic,50,9,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/uq33h/an_open_letter_to_all_that_speak_of_depression_as/,"She will not call you back in the morning. Before that even comes, though, while you’re in the act of fucking, she may change genders. She will take on the body of the one that you miss and hold it against you, literally and figuratively. You will find that it is her palm held over your mouth that keeps you silent, that keeps you from screaming, so now you know that whenever you have that howl weeping inside the back of your throat, it’s because Depression is giving you head beneathe the table.

Let it be warned that Depression has many friends, lovers that she will sell you for when she gets tired of your taste. She’ll bring over Loneliness, Fatigue, Hopelessness, Anger, Relentlessness— my God, she has a whole goddamned army ready to release at her disposal. They’ll befriend you slowly, gradually, until you’re composed of nothing more than the same atoms that they are. It will start with your loss of things, things that you take for granted. And you take a lot of things for granted, don’t you? Don’t lie to me. You take everything around you for granted and they can smell that, whatever it may be, that stench that keeps you from befriending your heart again (you’ll become enemies with your skeleton).

Don’t worry about their manners, though. They’ll apologize. It will be all they say. Every thrust, every rock of their hips, every inch they take of you, will be the sigh of an apology. They’re not trying to harm you. See, Depression is just trying to find a home and she’s always right around the corner. She’s homeless and desperate and needs to find the souls of those that don’t take care of themselves or appreciate themselves or find the beauty in the world around them and these words, they fucking sting, don’t they?

Every single time you think you’re seeing a glimpse of something that could make you happy, Depression or one of her friends is going to tackle you from behind like a long lost friend and get reacquainted with all that you’ve built inside, so don’t even bother with composing that orchestra or constructing Rome out of popsicle sticks. It doesn’t matter how in touch you get with your wrists, whether it’s with your mouth or a blade, Depression comes with a revenge when you’ve side-stepped her for long enough. She’s like that ex you can never get rid of, that’s always right behind the corner, ready to devour you whole.

Lose sight of the stars. Forget that we live in a single galaxy among billions, that we’re, individually, less than a mote of sand in the greater world and that what we did yesterday, what we do today, what we make of ourselves tomorrow— it won’t matter in a decade, let alone in a thousand years, when we’re exploding and melt back into the star matter we used to be in the first place. Weren’t we so much more beautiful then, anyway?

If, if this isn’t you, though, and you’re none of this and this doesn’t apply to you, then out of respect for those souls that are so weighed down with how they can wake up in the morning or how they’re going to deal with being themselves for even a moment longer that they take a pistol to the back of their throat, get out of bed, get dressed, and get the hell out of Depression’s bed. You don’t just have a one night stand with Depression. It’s not like that. You get married with her, have children, spend your life devoting yourself to what it takes to get even a fraction of an inch away from her. It is a never ending fight.

Depression is a whore. Honestly, she is, but she’s less of a whore than all of us that speak of her on a daily basis. All she’s doing is trying to find a place she can stay over night, while meantime we’re crowding ourselves with little pieces of her in an attempt to get a better idea of ourselves. I don’t feel sorry for me, or you, or anyone else, I feel sorry for Depression— she keeps having little bits of her tore off without her permission, stapled into the ribs of strangers, and she hasn’t got a way to get herself back.

Good luck with your adventures, honestly, and I apologize for the crude awakening. If you’d like to complain, I’m only a letter away. Don’t bother me tonight, though— I’m breaking up with Depression so that I can find myself in the bed of a beautiful woman with midnight hair instead. If I’ve only got one life left to live, I don’t want it to be like this. I’ve unstitched the remnants she leaves trembling in the pit of my stomach and handed them back. I’m not interested in this melancholy business anymore.

sometimes i think about calling you, dialing your phone number as reflexively as breathing, to hear your tired voice across channels of static after the fourth ring.  i want to tell you, *baby i am falling apart at the seams.*
 
and i know you'd laugh and shrug it off because every day i function like a normal girl.  my lungs expand and my blood circulates, i can write with steady hands and speak without a breaking voice.  i can pick up ripe fruit at the grocery store and nod and smile and thank strangers automatically.  i can laugh at jokes in dim restaurants, surrounded by friends whose hugs last a few heartbeats too long at the end of the night.  i sit up straight at work in my ergonomic chair to reply and forward emails for eight hours without pause.
 
and i want to tell you that this is the easy part, the automation of my life, the ceaseless functions that move my limbs and fix my smile.  but inside i am hollowed out.  there is nothing in a physiology textbook that can explain this, but every minute my chest is clawing like i have been drowning all my life.  i know you wouldn't understand, you'd scoff and tell me i'm fine.  you were never delicate, never tactful.  

but your love was there, below the smoker's cough and callused hands.  beneath the blunt words and raised eyebrows.  it was always there.  and so were you.
 
these are the simplest things to tell you, the sentences that are the most coherent.  the rest is harder to explain.  
 
i want to tell you that i'm sorry i didn't cry at your funeral.  i stood by your grave, hours after hours, and the tears never came.  i could only think about your bones, your beautiful body, close enough to touch but never again able to feel.  something hysterical, deep-rooted in my nerves, screamed for my hands to close around yours for one last time.  and i knew if i held you one last time, i would hold you forever and that six feet would never- *could never*- come between our bodies.
 
and i want to tell you that i can still drive that stretch of freeway, even though all my friends thought i would never be able to face i-285 after the accident.  but my hands don't tremble on the steering wheel and my eyes still focus straight ahead.  i want you to know that this is the bravest i have ever been.  i drive past that guardrail now, still crumpled and folded in like a horrifying art form, and i try not to see the flashing ambulance lights scattering neon colors into the night.  and thousands of commuters follow me past, their tired eyes peering over paper cups of coffee.  they grind their teeth in bumper-to-bumper traffic, feet jammed on their brakes beside the place where your blood once painted the gravel.  it is just another unbroken line of city scenery, and i do not want to remember you here.  this road is not sacred, this metal is no memorial, and i will not look back through the rearview mirror again.
 
and i want to tell you that the bullshit people say about time healing all wounds is the emptiest promise ever made.  that this gaping, clutching void inside me has never lessened, not for a single second.  and it feels like i drag myself across the daily landscape with a stomach wound that no one sees, hemorrhaging with your absence.  and i'm so fucking angry that we spent so much of our lives together, irrevocably searing your memories into anything and everything.  i wish it could be as easy as this one song, this one movie, this one place or memory that i could burn, sell, or lock away.  but you fucking permeated everything and no matter where i am, i was there with you first.  and time does not change this, does not lessen this inescapability.  
 
and i want to tell you that i always wake up at night feeling your body in bed, against me, but my eyes open to emptiness and a blank stretch of sheets.  and you'll laugh, but for months i kept a body pillow under our comforter.  so that if i tried i could almost imagine your back curved away from me, your sleep-flushed face buried beneath the blanket.  this is the best part of my life these days, when i close my eyes and sink deep into the warm and golden place where your smile and your hugs are polaroids with blurry edges, flaring softly to life in my dreams.  and i want you to know that every time i wake up, it feels like losing you all over again.
 
and i want to make this clear to you: that the talisman is not the worst part.  i know that i will take this empty chest with me to the grave, that i will be this hollow forever.  i know that i will see those flashing lights and hear the metallic squeal of brakes until the day i die.  i'll carry it everywhere, but i have accepted this burden as the price of loving you.  
 
i want you to know that the worst part exists in those moments i break down and call you.  your voicemail picks up after five rings, and i'm muffling my sobs in my arms so that i can hear you through the phone.  you tell me you're unavailable right now, but that you'll call me back if i leave a message.  

so i leave one.  i leave several.  

i fill your voicemail inbox and you haven't called me back.

If I were to put your name -- or perhaps your initial -- in this letter, it would be possible you could find it someday. But, even here, I am too shy to mention the initial. 

We are too different from each other. We are cut from different cloth. I know that we were never meant to be together. 

But what I want you to know is that I know your Reddit user name, and I have been reading your comments at least daily for several years. If you don't know that I specifically know, I think you at least know that any admirer would know. You make that username public through other means, so you must know that someone who loved you would Google it.

What I want to say -- and will never -- is how much I enjoy reading every single post you write. Over and above things about you personally (which are always my favorite), I have learned so much, about so many different topics, from you over the past few years. Your username is emblazoned into my fingers' memory, and it will forever be synonymous with Reddit for me. I have read and refreshed your overview page in a hospital room, at a breakfast table with a cup of coffee, in the heat of my own self-imposed passion, and in so many other situations that it has become simply a matter of habit; simply a way of checking in and seeing what this person I love has thought about today.

I have never given you an upvote, because I don't want to tamper with your life. But secretly, you get the biggest upvote I have to give.

I dread the day when you will realize that you have better things to do with your time, or a significant other calls you away, or you decide to change your user name, because then these precious little windows onto -- if not your life itself, then at least what you would like someone Googling you to think about your life-- will disappear. At the same time, I will be happy for you.
Someday, I'll get a significant other of my own and forget all about you. Someday, this will just be a distant and hopefully fond memory.

I'm afraid I've been wrongly placing blame upon your furry, nervous little shoulders for some time now. You see, I was certan it was you that routinely tore apart my bird feeders and scattered the seeds to the wind. You might understand how I could feel this way, as you are still annoying bastards who do in fact gobble up the seed from the ground and swing like tiny woodland monkeys from the feeders.

However, I should have understood that the strength required to pry apart metal clasps and yank bird feeders directly out of trees might be beyond you. So imagine my surprise last night, as I reclined upon my back-patio, when a rustling in the branches above me revealed no other than a wily, masked bandit at least four times your size, nimbly hanging from a limb and daintily removing birdseed with impressive dexterity! Indeed, it was none other than the creature first named by the Powhatan, aroughcun, derived from the proto-Algonquian root ahrah-koon-em, meaning roughly, he who rubs, scrubs, and scratches with his hands. And although his scientific classification might be the Latin Procyon lotor - literally, ""before-dog washer,"" in my neighborhood the apellation most readily at hand might be OH MY GOD IT'S A RACCOON!

I do admit that it was with some measure of delight I chased the little bugger, but only to try and capture a picture (alas, that was not to be - too dark outside).

So anyway, squirrels, I'm sorry that you alone bore my attitude of hatred at the defilement of my hanging backyard buffets. Move over, Johnny, there's a new kid in town - and he is totally adorable! Although, possibly rabid, so I won't be trying to catch, tame and pet him, as I was inclined to do, until my husband told me to stop acting like a dumbass, no one's petting any damned raccoons, are you crazy?

Oh and also, tell those deer that they are also on notice. I do believe it was them who ate absolutely all of the chamomile plants I put out last weekend. Not cool, wildlife, not cool at all.

I left you alone in that old run-down house with your crack addicted mother and her ""friends"". I regret that I took so long to watch the security cameras from the house, and what I saw terrified me. In the kitchen I saw my seven year old baby girl heating up a cheap TV dinner in a microwave she could barely reach. Outside of that back room door, I heard you asking if you could come in, and every time your mother told you no. In the living room I saw you sitting on the couch, hugging your knees, staring at the black screen of the TV. I saw you back at the door, asking when Mommy would tuck you into bed. And then, the thing that hurt me the most, was seeing you in bed, all happy at 9 pm bouncing up and down like a puppy at the prospect of Mommy coming to read you a story. Then came ten o'clock.

Then eleven.

Then twelve

Then at one, you cried yourself to sleep.

I remember the fit you threw when I told you I had to go to Arizona for two weeks. I thought it was just because you would miss me, but little did I know it was because of what went on day after day when I wasn't home. On birthdays 8-13 Mommy was never home, strangely getting arrested just before your birthday. When you were 13, you were so happy because Mommy had gotten help, she was better. Then six months after, she got cancer, and two months later she died on September 22nd, 2011.

Four days before you turned fourteen.

When I was moping around for the months after she died, I kept talking to you and throwing my grief at you. I remember the night I called you heartless because of how hardened you walked in to see your mother's body in that hospital bed in the living room. You looked at her once and went back to sleep. 

Then on your fifteenth birthday, I was talking about her and you finally let loose and screamed at me ""SHE'S GONE, I'M NOT! WHEN CAN MY BIRTHDAY BE MINE?!""

You're getting to know me, who I am, what I'm all about, but you don't know who I was. I used to be so guarded and depressed and fucked up. It took a lot of time for me to start thinking positively and enjoying the world around me. And I'm finally here. I'm finally ready for this, for you.

Our paths couldn't have crossed at a more perfect time. It's strange because we'd met so many times in the past but it took us until now to explore each other, and I think there's some meaning in that. I feel such a strange connection to you, the kind of connection that is rarely found. We are so much on the same page that it freaks me out sometimes. There is a beautiful understanding between you and I.

Simply put, I like you. I really, really like you. I know you've been hurt in the past, but I want you to know that I will never hurt you. Maybe that seems like a ludicrous thing to promise, but I mean it with everything in me. You're more than a romantic interest, you're becoming one of my best friends. I care about you deeply and all I want to do is make you happy and make your life a little sweeter, the way you have made mine.

I'm sorry. I can feel your sadness. Even across time twenty years, I can feel your sadness. I know you feel like you're so close to what you want. But we'll get to that later. I feel like I owe you an explanation of what awaits you the next twenty years. And all the apologies I can find.   

You're only five. So I'll try to keep this as simple as I can. But you're a smart kid. Never work without your gloves. You're a smart kid. Stay the hell away from love. In 2003 you're going to run into those lyrics for the first time. They're only going to get more relevant the older you get. But we both know you want nothing more than love. Even when you're sitting alone in your mom's old house writing this twenty years from now. You are a smart kid. But you'll need to work for it. Even if you don't understand everything I'm saying right now. You'll grow to understand.   

Enjoy what little of the perfect happiness you have left. I wish I didn't have to tell you that. I wish that in twenty years you did feel happy. Don't get me wrong. Things are better now. But I'm not you. I'm not about to get my confidence crushed by your mother when she screams at you “you used to be such a nice boy. What happened?”. You won't know what happened. You'll never know. At least when you're 25 you won't know. Its only a few months away now.   

Shortly after that is when the fighting will start. Between your parents. You're going to wish you could remember when your parents were happy. And your memory is so good. But you won't remember when they're happy. It'll start slow. Passively. But by the time Mom leaves in August of 97, your only memories of your parents for the past year will have been them yelling “go to hell” back and forth.   

You'll tell Dad this later, and he'll be sorry. As of the time you right this, you won't have told your mom. It'll be nearly a decade before she's in your life again. You won't want to screw that up. I promise you its not your fault. She has problems. You know that. You just don't know how bad they are. You won't know that the man dad caught her cheating with will go on to beat her and abuse her. Dad won't know either. Otherwise he would have beat the man with his own two hands. You'll make things work with her. Even if you're going to accidentally strain the relationship a few months before you write this.   

I'm sorry your half siblings don't love you. I'm sorry they don't want to be in your life. I'm sorry there will be nights you'll cry yourself to sleep because you can't see your niece anymore. She will love you. Maybe more than she loved anyone else. And you'll love her more than almost anyone else. I wish I could tell you you'll have a relationship with her again when she's older. But right now, I don't know the answer to that. And I wish I did. Cause I know it would give you some solace.   

I'm sorry you feel guilty for Dad's relationship with his other kids. Its not your fault. Their mom hated you and mom. And Dad for that matter. She told them to stay away. But he made a choice. He chose to be the Dad to you he wished he was to his other kids. I think he knew how much that meant to you. But make sure you tell him. Tell him before.   

The divorce will crush you. Sort of. More the counseling really. You'll know and understand that mom cheated on dad and that's why he left. It had nothing to do with you. But you'll waste too much energy trying to convince other's of that. You're going to blame a lot of your troubles in high school on this. Some of its warranted. Just try to move on as quickly as you can.   

You're going to build up your walls. And for years it will work. Until you meet a couple of girls who will tear them down. You won't date them. You'll want to. One won't feel the same way. The other...well...you know its just a sex thing. And you'll love her too much as a person just to use her.   

You're going to meet a girl who you think is perfect. You're going to chase after her for five years. She's going to break you. Its not her fault though. She's a good person. She's just too far away and won't feel the same way about you. You'll meet her replacement. She'll use you. You'll love her too. You'll make her a better person, and she'll grow up to be a great woman. But again, it wasn't meant to be. Just don't tell her she was the replacement. That was cruel. She'll forgive you. But you may never forgive yourself.   

There were a couple of other girls. Merely footnotes really. The one you'll set up with your best friend. She'll nearly kill him. But you'll redeem yourself by getting him to break up with her before he asks her to marry him. But more on that in a second.   

I'm sorry you'll watch your Dad become the adulterer. I'm sorry it'll almost get you  killed. Several times. He won't mean it. And on some level you'll hate him for putting your life in jeopardy. But remember, he's human. He's not the super hero you built up in your mind. And yet, he is. He always will be. But everything he did, he did for love. Even if they used him. I'm sorry you'll follow in his footsteps.   

I'm sorry you're going to go through such a deep depression. I'm even more sorry that you're the one that's going to have to diagnose it yourself.  That no one around you will see the sorrow in you. That no one will understand why you got addicted to drugs to help ease the pain. That you wasted so much of your senior year because you hated yourself. I'm sorry that no one will speak up until its after the fact.   

You'll fall for another girl who will bring out the worst of you. She'll cause your life to spiral nearly out of control. You'll love each other, but you'll never make it work.   
But you'll find a way in college. You'll get your life together. You'll find a sense of purpose. Meaning. You'll make things work. You'll make people proud. You'll find people who like you for you and not the money you used to have. You'll even find a girl who'll show you what love is really about. That every woman is special in her own way. And that you don't have to compare them to each other, so long as your both happy. When you write this you'll still be a virgin and never have been in a relationship. But you'll be thankful for the experiences you have.   

I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I'm sorry that you're going to have to watch the man you idolize. Your hero. The man you love most in this world. Slowly start to lose his mind. I'm sorry that it will start right as you're getting your life together. I'm sorry that its going to derail that. I'm sorry that you're going to be the only one to take care of him for two years. I'm sorry you're never going to feel like you did enough for him. I'm sorry for when your heart will shatter the moment you put him into a nursing home.   

I'm sorry that you turned to alcohol. I'm sorry that as you're writing this you're going to question if the first tumbler of whiskey was necessary. Much less this third one. I'm sorry you haven't found a way to pull it back together.   

And. The reason why we started this letter in the first place. You found another girl. And god is she beautiful. Not just on the outside. But on the inside too. She won't see it sometimes. But you will. The problem is she's dating your best friend. An even bigger problem is that she wants to be with him. The biggest problem is that you'll fall in love with her, and she will fall in love with you. 

I'm sorry. I know you wanted to get married and have kids. And I know you'll want to marry her. When she asked you if you would when she was wearing mom's old ring it will be all you can do to keep from kissing her and asking what you have to do to get her to keep it on. You're going to really feel like she loves you. And it'll be the most in love you'll ever have been in to this point.   

Your best friend will be living with her in a city that's an hour away. You won't want to move there. He will hate living there. It will slowly kill him. You're going to tell him to consider moving back here even if he works things out with her on a night he considers leaving her.   

You won't follow in dad's footsteps and become the adulterer. But it will be a constant fight every day. Dad drilled the concepts of honor and loyalty into you. And you will follow them the letter. You won't cheat. But you'll dream of her. Of touching her. Kissing her. Making here feel as beautiful as she is. Holding her. Sleeping with her. Doing all the things she wants from your best friend but doesn't get from him.   

I'm sorry you feel the way that you do. I'm sorry your life has been so much heartache. I'm sorry you put yourself in this situation. I'm sorry that you're willing to deal with and accept the consequences. But its not your fault. You've saved their relationship more times than you can count. But right now. The right thing to do may be to tell them to break up. You don't want to be with her that way. But looks at the facts. He's killing himself with booze and apathy there. Yeah she's made mistakes. But she's working on them. So much so that's she's starting to have good opportunities in the city. But he's away from his family. Where he wants to be. She doesn't want to leave. He does.  

Ha. You're starting to get too drunk to really make sense anymore. You won't understand how your writing heroes were drunk while they wrote. This isn't helping your craft at all.   

You want them both to be happy. And right now, maybe them breaking up will make them both happy. He gets to move home and he can find someone who makes him happy. Maybe she can be happy with you. Maybe not. But your life goals sync more with hers. You want the marriage and kids. He doesn't. You like being sappy and romantic. He doesn't. You just want to be with her for the rest of your life. You're not sure if he feels the same way.   

But you're going to do whatever you have to support both of them. Because you love both of them more than anyone except dad. Because he is your brother. Because you want her to be your lover. If your relationship with her has to evolve you'll make it so. Because you want her in your life. No matter what. You're not afraid of finding someone else anymore. You've done nothing but find someone better every time. But right now, you don't want to find someone else. Maybe in time you will.   

I'm sorry you're eyesight won't let you be a pilot. To be a war hero like your uncle. But you're gonna fly some day. I swear that to you. I swear I will get things together. But that's not for you to worry about. You worry about being you. You worry about growing up into the sweet kid your mom tells you she doesn't understand how you turned out to be so good. I'll find our way again. I swear. Because I want to. Because I need to. Because if I love her as much as I do, I have to. To be with her. But mostly, in case this isn't the universe where we're with her, for myself. One day we will love ourself again. One day we will be happy. We just have to start walking down that path. Believe in me, lil Jake. Because sometimes, it feels like you're the only one who does.

* You're not poor, you're broke. There's a difference, you dumb motherfucker. Your dad has a 7 bedroom house in california. He paid your rent in full. You own your own car. You're getting student loans. You didn't ever have to do your own laundry but somehow you still needed all my quarters. You would spend $400 a month on weed and acid, whereas I lived off of $50 of groceries. You were always hitting me up for money, and when it became clear you weren't getting any, you decided to help yourself to my food. When I told you about it, you never remembered. And you're not an addict; you can't get addicted to pot, you fucking idiot. Your grades crashed because you were just too lazy to do anything that didn't give you instant gratification.

* It was totally fine that you always invited three friends over to come play X-Box. Honestly. It's the other three guys watching, snorting coke, and cleaning their guns that annoyed me. I can't believe none of the dorm officials ever picked up on this. I would have turned you in to the authorities if I wasn't the ONLY person who knew about your operation that wasn't making money off of it. Newsflash, genius: I wasn't always at the library because I studied so hard. I was always there because it was safe and open 24 hours a day. 

* When I said you were a dumb motherfucker, I wasn't kidding. You called yourself a genius all the time. I noticed the list of law schools you had pinned to your wall. ""Yale"" highlighted in bold. I have news for you, people who get into Yale Law school don't spend all their free time jacking off (figuratively AND literally) while thinking about how awesome it's going to be when they get into Yale. They think about how they're going to get an A on their next test. You, on the other hand, thought about how you were going to spend the $2,000 you received twice a month to strap $250,000 beneath your fat folds, fly across the country, and traffic controlled substances back across state lines. Those guys you ran with, they had absolutely no risk because you were too dumb to snitch on them if you had gotten caught. They tickled your idiotic Scarface fantasies, made you feel like a boss, then laughed at you as soon as you were out of the room. 

You thought I was your best friend. I wasn't. You don't know what a friend is; everyone else only exists in whatever capacity that they can enable you. You're toxic. 

I tried to help you. I tried so much. I organized study schedules for you. I made you calendars. I made you a fucking diet and I even took you to the gym. I took you to the library. I walked you to your classes and helped you talk with your professors, talk with the school. I sat down and made sure you opened your books. I tutored you when I could. None of it mattered. At the end of the day, you weren't willing to put in the effort required to be successful. As long as you had weed or pussy, you could find reasons to settle for less for in every other part of your life.

Cutting you out completely was the best damn decision I ever made. My GPA the other three years of college was a 3.96. My GPA that year was a 3.0. You didn't keep me out of medical school (though you may have kept me out of my top choices. Who knows? I wish I didn't have to live with that doubt). 

I realize this is all probably part of some much larger issues you have. I honestly, sincerely hope you turn things around and get some help. But not from me.

I know what hate is because I feel it for you. I've never hated anyone. I've needed to tell you this for so many years. I need you to know what a horrific excuse for a person you are. I don't even know you and I would never want to. 

I saw your ridiculous FB post about your 'missing daughter.' I know I shouldn't look at your profile but my curiosity has gotten the better of me. She's going to be in high school next year. You have voluntarily missed all of her schooling. You weren't there on the first day of kindergarten, I was. She reluctantly hugged me goodbye. She did not cry. Her reluctance wasn't out of fear of school it was fear of me. Do you know how long it took her to really feel comfortable around me? To love me as a child should love her mother? Do you know the fear you instilled in her? How do you abandon a child? And her father, do you know the fear he had? He loved me then and he loves me now, but I will forever know the reluctance he had to allow me into their lives. We are a family now, we've always been. You mean nothing. 

You may not come back now and be 'found'. We don't want to find you, she's not looking for you. She has a mother who loves her. We will not allow you back in. We've spent years providing the love and security you failed to give. Two months ago I watched her graduate from Junior High School. She is amazing, she is my daughter. I am her mother. She has no memories of you. Not one. 


It was your choice to abandon her. My husband did not steal her from you. Such an implication is completely ridiculous. You've never once made contact with us in the nine years I've been raising her. Never once. Our address is on file with CSE, our phone number is too. You know how to get ahold of us should you need to. You can write a letter, pick up a phone -anything. Instead you cower behind the lie that my husband has stolen her from you. And you've never tried to contact us. Who are you lying for? Is this how you explain away your failure to yourself? 

To see you refer to yourself as her mother takes something from me. It takes away the lessons I've taught her. It takes away the nights we've spent working on homework. It takes away the days we've spent shopping for the perfect graduation dance dress. It takes away the songs we've sung in the car, out of pitch but at the top of our lungs. It takes from me the things I've done as her mother. The things you've chosen not to do. I will not let you have that. I am her mother. You are nothing.

Those were good times we shared, weren't they? 

And when you hurt me, I am glad that you were honest. I needed it. Thank you. You changed me as a person. I grew up while loving you. I won't ever forget you, of course, but I'm no longer grasping desperately to the feelings I had for you. I'm smiling and waving, watching the foolish, young love morph into something completely different.

I know that you will always love me, as I always love you... but now in the way of a friend. A familiar sort of love. You told me to take that with me, wherever I go, and I will. That love will give me strength. Even though you couldn't be there for me when I needed you, even though my passion for you led me to bad decisions, even though you caused me more pain than anyone had before- I will carry that love. You believed in me.You believed in me when I didn't believe in me.

You made me feel beautiful, amazing, a goddess in human form. I learned to love myself, in part thanks to you. You showed me how powerful my feelings could be and the absolute beauty of love. I'm no longer bitter, angry, and caustic. I accept that it is, indeed, over. I want you to be happy. I know that you will find happiness, and I hope that you enjoy your life... even though you chose a life without me.

It's okay to move on. I had to tell myself that. ""No, my love is different. It's supposed to last forever! We were special!"" Oh, silly girl that I was. You made me believe, and there is nothing wrong with that. I know that I will fall foolishly, recklessly in love again even if that relationship will also end someday. That's alright. It's the nature of life; things do end. That doesn't make them any less beautiful.

Now, dearest one. I hope I helped you the same way you helped me. Our breakup was for the best. I knew that even at my worst, even when I broke down and cried and screamed and hurt myself. I learned so much since, and I'm still learning. I'm realizing things. I am growing. I hope you are, too.

And honestly with what I hear next to me I am somewhat afraid of finishing up before you to see who you actually are. 

Because your ass, my friend, has something seriously wrong with it. I am not even kidding. From the desperate gasps and grunts you give off shuffling through the door and onto the seat, I can only begin to imagine the utter and complete discomfort you have somehow inflicted upon your colon.

I saw possible futures for myself, and I looked forward to them. As long as I had you, I felt invincible. My self esteem skyrocketed. You were there for me when no one else was, when I could no longer tell anyone what was going on, you were there. You comforted me.

If you ever come in again, your meal is on the house.",gingertou,34,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hhewr/neither_of_you_will_ever_know_what_you_did_but/,"It was a pretty long day.

I had just gotten some bad news from my doctor about a gum infection, I had been driving around all day, and I knew I was going to have a long night of bartending ahead of me.

The restaurant's been going through renovations for a week or so, and so I knew that half of it would be cordoned off to have the flooring redone, while the bar and front of house would remain open.

Anyways, I had just gotten back from running a delivery (our main driver totaled his car earlier in the night) and it was around 11:30. I was taking the umbrellas in from outside, watering plants, and generally getting ready to call it a night, when an elderly couple walked in (I'm pretty good at gauging my customers' ages, and these two were definitely past 85. Could barely make it through the door).

They asked if we were still open, and I said yes, but explained that the renovating team was going to start really working on the other side of the wall, and it might be best for them to come back tomorrow.
To my surprise, they said as long as it was no trouble, they'd still like a table.

So I sat them down near the window (the restaurant otherwise totally empty) and got them their tea and a Tsingtao beer for the gentlemen. After leaving them to decide on orders, I ducked into the kitchen for a wine restocking. After a bit, I checked on them through the video feed in the back room, and what I saw split my face into an unexpected (and rather painful, given my sutures) smile.

The elderly gentlemen was dragging his chair around the table, wedging it into the corner, and proceeding to put his arm around his (I assume) wife. To see them just sit together, leaning on one another, was precious. But it got better.

After they ordered a meal to share, I brought them some wonton soup. Just as I reached the table, the renovation crew started ripping out the flooring, which disturbed the plastic sheeting in the doorway and also made a godawful racket. They were using a rotary saw to dig through the particle-board subfloor, which was somewhat against building code and *definitely* not supposed to happen until all my customers were gone and the kitchen closed down. But there wasn't really anything I could do, other than get my customers some filter masks to wear (as we didn't know what was under the flooring, possibly mold, it was a suitable precaution).
So I found myself watching these two amazing friends share a meal, lifting the filter masks off briefly to eat, and smiling and talking quietly the whole time. Just realizing that they had probably been doing this for *decades,* and were still coming into restaurants to share late night dates, made me feel so much better. 

They stayed until past midnight, all the while the reno guys were hammering and sawing and tearing down part of the back wall. Never mind that there was no way they could hear each other talk, or that the table shook sometimes and knocked the wine menu to the ground, or that they had cheap filter masks strung across their faces.

I never got the chance to get their names, or even hold the door for them on their way out like I usually would. My father's team was put in charge of the subflooring and tile renovations, and since he couldn't make it tonight I had to clock out and start directing them through the whole thing. By the time I finished, the restaurant was closed and the couple long gone. By the time I got home, I knew I needed to throw this story onto UL. It might not be much, but their obvious love and devotion to one another, even through all these years, really helped a tired and sick bartender to remember what's important and get back on his feet.

So thank you. I hope one day, when I'm that old, I'll have a similar past of love and respect like what you two can enjoy.
I just hope I'll have a better bartender.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1hhewr,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hhewr/neither_of_you_will_ever_know_what_you_did_but/,

This is a letter to you, the one who can't bear to live in a world without him. The one who can't take all of the pain and heartbreak in such a cruel world. The one who feels so alone after he left you.

You, dear girl, are stronger than you think. Believe me. At least listen a bit, I know you think I am spouting bullshit. I mean this. The love you have for him is beautiful and great and you just have so much love to offer the world. Do you realize how many people would love to feel the way he felt? As if you were sunshine, brightening and warming up his life. You can make so many people happy by just being you. I know, I know. They aren't him. 

What is so great about him, anyway? Life with him wasn't happiness and freedom and perfection. He hurt you. He's the reason that you, a kind and sweet girl, sit there feeling as if you lost the world. Would someone so perfect for you leave you like that? He doesn't love you the way you deserve to be loved, believe it or not. You deserve so much more, dammit. Your life can and will go on. Yes, you're in pain, but you don't realize how many people need you. 

You're more than his ex girlfriend, someone who was dumped, and you're not a lost cause. You're brilliant, kind, thoughtful, fascinating, complex, gorgeous, and an overall fantastic human being. You are more than that relationship. People love you, you know. Your existence is a blessing to the world. Please, remember that I believe in you. I'm far from the only one.

Right?

Even if you did, we shouldn't want someone who doesn't want you. I'm sorry I let you feel the way you did and did nothing to find out if he felt the same way. I was just worried it would end. I really didn't want it to end. It was selfish of me. I could've saved us both a lot of sorrow, and again, I'm sorry I put you through that. 

Listen, next time, we won't be afraid to tell someone how we feel. The second you know, you tell me, and I'll say it. I won't hold back. We won't think of the consequences. We'll just do it, and let brain step in and evaluate things from there.

Wake up tomorrow, and do yourself a favor. Stretch. Drink a glass of cold water. Open the blinds a crack and look out on the street. Let the light from the sky hurt your eyes for a moment until they adjust. Shuffle over to the bathroom, take a routine morning shit and then make breakfast.

*""Sit. Feast on your life.""*

Let the thoughts pass by as though you're a bystander watching the bullet trains zip by during rush hour. Let it roll by. Breathe. Change your posture in your seat. Notice every little detail, every bit of sensory data your body gives you in response.

You're alive and you're breathing.

I know existence can feel like a burden. I know you wonder why you were born. I know how weak you feel at times. How broken, how hollow. I know how you seem happy, but every time you laugh, your heart hurts a little. I know how you desperately scour the earth for somebody to open your eyes to beauty again, but you've known all along that you need to find it yourself first.

I know how scared you are to face the world.

But I want to you remember that you aren't completely alone.

There's always something you can do. Somebody you can talk to.

I know there's little comfort in words, but remember that you have friends. People you love. People who you care for, and who care about you in return. Limitless and unconditional friendships. People who will accept you even if you are in pieces. People who will even lend a hand and pick up a couple and hand them to with you with a smile.

So, please.

Rediscover and fall in love with the small details, the tiny vessels of beauty that constitute the world all over again. Remember the bright, unstoppable eyes you had as a child and let them be your viewing glass. When the world loses its color, grab your friends and paint it the color of everything. Open your heart once again and let love spill out.

You may not remember me, but I went to high school with you. We had tech apps together. I would like to share my last remembrance of you. It starts with a young boy who didn't have much affection as he needed from his father. The young boy knew he was loved, but didn’t quite get that father/son attention that he so desperately needed. Family vacation came often, but it never quite filled the void he felt. His father took him on a roller coaster called Dueling Dragons, and boy, was it exhilarating. Walking through the gift shop after the ride his father spotted something. It was a gift he knew his son would love and cherish. As cheesy as it may sound it was a pen! It wasn’t even an expensive pen. It had wood inlay and metal dragons around it. When presented with the pen the boy became ecstatic. Dragons were his favorite thing. How in the world would his father know this? He must have known. He must have.

You may be asking yourself, “For the love of Pete Ross Gumbo! What in the world does this have to do with me?” Well… In our class we had together people were assigned partners to complete certain tasks. It was a Monday when we were assigned video editing together. We were both busy doing the best we could to complete the task when I noticed something. You were writing with the same exact pen that I had lost a couple days earlier. This pen was the same pen that my father gave me as a gift. I immediately asked you “Where did you get that pen?” You replied, “I took it from a friend.”

I thought you were a cool person in school, but I wouldn’t consider you a friend. You took that pen from me. I’m not a confrontational person and without even trying you crushed me.

tl;dr - you took my pen, a pen that had more sentimental value than you understand. And I’m still, to this day, affected by it.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1iltbz,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1iltbz/you_stole_my_pen_in_high_school/,

Remember to kiss me, dammit. 



Take a break.

Pay attention to my face.

Kiss me hard.

Be aggressive.

Use your mouth to fuck my pussy. 

Kiss my clit and suck it, too.

Tongue my cunt up and down. 

Make me cum,

I miss your arms. Your hands. Your legs. Your body pressed against mine as we hug. 

I miss your lips. They're soft and they're like home to me. I miss feeling them against mine. I miss feeling them pressed against my forehead, assuring me of your love. 

I miss being intimate with you. Avoiding your gaze and then looking into your eyes over and over again. Feeling beautiful and feeling so connected and loved and passionate. I miss laughing with you during sex and how amazing sex feels with you. I miss counting down from 3 and trying not to ruin the sheets (again). 

I miss your smile and my favourite dimple in your cheek. I miss kissing the space on your cheek right beside your nose. I miss kissing your forehead. I miss kissing you. 

I miss when you lift your arm and I can move in for a tickle attack. I miss the deep, honest laugh that erupts out of you following tickles. I miss being playful with you. 

I miss running my hands through your soft brown hair and looking into your gorgeous big brown eyes and knowing that everything will be okay. I miss your soft skin on your face and all over your body.  

I miss waking up next to your peaceful, handsome face and falling in love with you even further. I miss that first time in the morning where you open your eyes and look into mine and say, ""hey"" in that cheeky little voice and then fall back asleep. I miss cuddling at bed time and sleepily rolling away from each other to squeeze out a ""good night babe, I love you"" as we both drift off into our dreams. 

I miss talking to you at the end of every day and asking you about your day and hearing even what others would consider the boring details. I miss sharing my weight loss progress with you and cheering on your workouts at the gym. I miss eating unhealthy food with you, movie nights, and playing hockey on Xbox in our underwear. 

I miss our deep laughter and smiles from ear to ear. I miss your cat and your family and the smell of your bedroom. I miss your suitcase in the corner beside my night stand. 

I miss showering with you and helping you wash your body. I miss hugging and touching you from behind as you rinse out your shampoo. I miss kissing you under the falling water and getting butterflies in my stomach because of it. 

I miss cooking meals with you and going for walks with my dog together. I miss squealing at pictures of corgis, teasing you with pictures of porn, and laughing at funny gifs and videos together.

I miss you, all of you. Every part of every day. I am so sorry for saying hurtful things to you and starting dumb fights. I am sorry for not taking the time to slow down and appreciate us more. I miss you in every fibre of my being, every bone in my body. I miss you so incredibly much and cannot imagine never seeing you again.

I know you still can't hear, but something tells me you still think about me, because i think way too loud. It's 3 in the morning here in my room, and you still keep me up at night thinking. I wanted to say Happy Birthday, after all I know you wont be telling me happy birthday tomorrow. I'm writing you this letter because you promised me a discussion we have never had. It still bothers me to this day that I haven't gotten this off my chest.

That year and a half we spent together was the best I have ever had with a girl. I still remember the cute faces you would make and the inside jokes we would have. When I met you I wasn't put together, yet neither were you, but together we were one. Then again we are both still broken. It felt like we were damaged toys, in a way the blind leading the deaf. We continued to break each other, and I speak for myself when I say this, but some how when when we were together it felt like everything was ok. As if my flaws and insecurities didn't matter. We were a Helen Keller couple out to prove that love is blind and turns a deaf ear to those who appose it. 

On my birthday it will be exactly 5 months since we broke up, since I last spoke to you. Yet you still find a way to push me to be better, to improve. So far you are the only other tool I have met hard enough to sharpen my edge. As the months went on, and we spent more time together we walked out of shit smelling like roses. And let me tell you!! I have never felt worse... You haunt me in a way no one else can. You are a disease in my flesh and a virus in my mind. I work harder than I ever have only to run away from your image. I go nowhere in my head, but my body is making leaps and bounds.

Forgive me for being selfish and wanting you for myself, but in the end I gave you your freedom because i couldn't cage a bird like you. After all I took you under my wing, I had a hand in molding who you were... When we met, you were a fresh adult still in her teens, but had to grow up way too early. 

Looking back to when I first saw you walking into the restaurant and  can still remember what you wore. You were gorgeous, time slowed as you walked past. Then before I knew it time sped back up and i was sitting there next to you offering you a bit of my food so you would eat and I would bask in the glory of your persona. It was more love at first sight than I have ever heard or dreamt of. I knew you were deaf and you were surprised I could tell when no one else could. I taught you how to sign, I brought you into my world, the deaf world. You discovered a culture where I could hand feed you keys to riddles like ""143"" ""I love you"" or ""I hate you"" or ""258"" ""Very interesting."" I gave you, your escape from the reality that you lived. 

When you told me your father had cancer I knew you were telling me I had to make a choice. I thought about whether or not to continue dating you for a long, hard 3 milliseconds. Little did I know things would only get worse and never get better. As time went on, your fathers health diminished and so did your hearing. Your family moved away and we hit our bumps in the road. No matter what happened I was by your side. If you needed time for yourself I would give it to you, if you needed me to hold you I had an iron grip. I felt like the perfect boyfriend. Yes, I had been a shitty boyfriend to the girls before you and this is my karma. The one relationship I would try my hardest on, you probably couldn't respect because you didn't know what to expect. But that's ok.

I remember when your father died, your family moved away, you lost your hearing and you moved in with your new perfect family. That was when the storm had passed and you no longer needed to be tethered to your rock. In my eyes things could finally start to be happy and worry free, but in my heart I knew differently. Something told me that once everything had settled down you would find your balance and get bored of me.

Look as us now, you are off to your deaf school, single and happier than you ever have been. Me, well im still pissing and moaning about letting you go. Forgive me for still hurting, karma is a bitch and I probably deserved what I got. I am sorry for what you went through, you were too beautiful of a person to feel that much hurt. One thing I will thank you for is showing me that it is far better to love and be hurt, than to have been loved and felt nothing.

I no longer know who you are, and I have grown to resent you. The girl I knew would have called me and asked me how i was, you would have been my friend at a distance. Maybe the thought of that hurt you. I hope it did. But then again, you aren't the girl I started dating. No girl is, I always told you, ""You are never with the same person you first started dating, it's whether or not you love the person they have become that is important."" I guess I grew into someone you couldn't love.

You will be happy to know that since we have been separated, I went through part of what you went through. Except I had to do it for the most part alone. Please mind my words as you recollect our past. This may sound harsh but be grateful you didn't have to dig your fathers grave, or take the shirt of your back because he died with nothing, and no one or a button up to be buried in. Be grateful you had even a friend there to help carry the burden that your life had given you. Be grateful that you had love to light a way through a dark time.

What am i grateful for? I am grateful for the family I had never met and the townspeople who I did not know, that helped me carry the coffin of my dead father through a town long forgotten by me or the country I live in. I am grateful for the blood, sweat and tears I put into restoring my own image after you tore it down. I am grateful for everything else life has given me. I believe you should be grateful for the family that took you in, that you live with a hard working father and a wonderful, hard working mother. Be grateful that your daily life isn't a woman that cant control her illness or a man that can't control his addiction. But with you it has never really been about me.

Most of all... be grateful for the life i helped you find. Use it to your advantage, make the best decisions. Find your dream job, find your dream man, and make a dream life, not a nightmarish living. I loved you, and this will be my only letter to you. You have taken enough of my life to call your own. I will no longer bitch and moan about who you were to me, because my life isn't bad. I am a success in my own way, and i consider you one of my greatest achievements.

I had forced it from my mind, forced myself to forget, but no longer. In addition to the beatings and the sexual abuse, you fucking raped me. I'm finally admitting it to even myself after... six years? Seven? It's been quite a long time, but I'm getting through this because I'm going to university and I'm leaving you behind. 

It doesn't matter to me that we'll be on the same campus. It doesn't matter to me that I'll be spending time at your apartment, because you're my brother and we happen to share friends. Would you like to know why it doesn't matter? 

It doesn't matter because I will break numerous bones in your body if you ever touch me like that again. Your baby sister has become lethal, and you're the reason why. You made to slap me about a month ago, when you came to visit home. If you had, I would have broken every bone in that hand. This is not a threat, sweetheart: this is a promise. You will never hurt me again, and you will never hurt that sweet girl who you claim you've fallen in love with. If I have my way, you will *never* hurt anyone ever again. I won't press charges, but I make sure that every female friend you have knows you have a dark side. An angry, abusive dark side. 

I was supposed to be able to trust you. To be able to turn to you for anything. Protection, advice, anything on the Goddess' green earth that I could have possibly needed. But what do you do when the person you're running from is the person who's supposed to be protecting you? You run even further away. 

I'm grateful that once we entered high school, the beatings became less. Don't get me wrong, they were still there. But we shared friends, and somehow you just couldn't handle your friends liking me. By the end of my freshman year, you were graduating and you were afraid of me because you knew that I could kick you ass. You'd deserve it, too. You are a lying sack of shit and someday I will kick your ass. 

A few weeks ago I took a women's self defense seminar with my best friend. Most of it I had no issue with. Some of it I had already figured out on my own: buck your hips to throw your attacker off balance, slide back on the ball of your shoulder to get away from your attacker... At some point, I murmured to my best friend ""I wish I would have known this a decade ago."" One of the instructors heard me, and you should have seen her face. It was a cross between horror and murderous intent. I actually had to take a break for a few minutes because the husband of one of the instructors wanted to see if I could throw him off. I couldn't even try, because he looked just a little like you. The fear was back, if only for a split second. I started fucking CRYING. I was horrified. How is it, that even after you've been gone, you still have some kind of power over me? 

Maybe if I had been able to fight back you wouldn't have beaten the shit out of me at every opportunity. Maybe our parents would have fucking believed me when I said you were hurting me, as opposed to what they did... which was telling me that I was making it up. As if. I could have made up. The bruises. And the burns. As if. I could have made up. That you raped. Your younger sister. 

Of course, I didn't remember it until a few weeks ago. I had flashes of it, but not a fully formed memory until I actually tried to remember. For weeks, I could not even cuddle with the man who became my boyfriend because his fingers became yours and his kisses became yours. It was a stark contrast: gentle to harsh and biting. I didn't want to remember, but I did. I had to fucking *throw him off of me* because I couldn't bear to be touched. It took fucking WEEKS. 

We were so careful, and so slow. I had to tell him. He was horrified, and asked if he could hold me. You may hate him, but he has been so good for me. Fuck you for screwing up part of my life. YOU WERE THE REASON I COULD NOT TOUCH ANYONE FOR FOUR YEARS OF MY LIFE. Any touch that I received during that time period was a punch, a slap, or a kick from you. I have come so far since then. 

So go fuck yourself. I am becoming the person you tried so hard to prevent me from being. You told me that I would never amount to anything, that I would die a virgin, that I was ugly and stupid and that no one would ever love me. Well guess what, sweetheart? 

I have a higher GPA than you ever did, and I spend my time doing things that I love. I am one of the few freshman on our university's drumline, and one of the few girls as well. I have met a wonderful man who appreciates me for who I am, not for what I can give him. I am healthier and happier than I ever was, so fuck you for telling me that I couldn't do it. Because I've done it, and here I am. 

It doesn't matter that you're coming home for a week-long visit, and you're supposed to arrive tonight. It doesn't matter that I have to see you through the one year of university that we share. It doesn't matter because I will send you to the hospital if you ever. Fucking. Touch me. Again. 

I will not say sorry for saying this. I will say sorry for not speaking out against you sooner. I felt as though I couldn't. I still don't feel safe with you sleeping in the same house that I am. The only thing that comforts me is the knowledge that I have through months of martial arts training. I am not afraid to hurt you if you try anything. 

Your ""worthless"" baby sister is finally becoming someone who she can be proud of. You can say anything you like at this point, but remember dear brother... 

I've got proof, and I'm not afraid to use it. Have a wonderful evening, bastard.

We haven't seen each other in about two weeks and it is really weird sense you and I would spend some time together nearly each day. I guess I should tell you that I fell in love with you over the course of this year, but I only realized it a week ago. 

These feelings really suck because of your girlfriend. You and her have been together for a year and a half now. I would just like to say that while my feelings are inappropriate, your actions were hardly appropriate. As you and I know, nothing physical ever happened (besides when you walked me home after a night of drinking and you held your arms around me, but that was just so I didn't teeter into the street). If anything happened it was emotional. I'm not sure if it was just one sided either. My best friend believes that you, at one point, had feelings for me too. The way you called me for dinner, asked if I had gotten back to campus yet from a weekend at home, to those late night walks we would take for the sake of boredom. 

While this confession is one of the main reasons I am writing you, I also want to explain what happened two nights ago. For two weeks we have hardly talked, which has been hard for me because I really miss you. It's odd for you to not go this long without talking to me, but now that the semester is over, your girlfriend has time for you, which is probably the reason I have not heard from you. Two nights ago though was my true realization for the feelings I have though. She posted the picture on Facebook. The picture of the ring you got her. I know its not an engagement ring, but it hit me hard. I cried over you, and from what you know about me, it takes a lot for me to cry over something. I realized that I love you. And I realized that you will never know. 

With love,

It was a night like any other night. We went out to the kink-community party and had a fucking blast. We danced, we sang karaoke, we talked, we had a drink or two (but we weren't drunk). We got back to my place and started to play.

First the hood went on. My favorite. Then you bound my arms the way we love to have them bound. Then you gagged me.

Safe word use has never been a problem before. It started to get too intense. I was screaming RED at the top of my lungs. SCREAMING IT. You didn't hear it. You thought I was playing. I was snapping my fingers like crazy. You didn't hear it. You kept going.

When you understood what I was doing you stopped and you were so upset. I spent the next hour comforting you even though I was so scared I was shaking like a leaf.

Nothing I’ve ever done has lingered with me quite as much as certain things I haven’t done. The un-done is haunting. Because a fantasy is like a ghost, ever immediate and ageless, easily summoned and nearly impossible to exorcise. You know what I mean. You’re a man of feeling, you throb just like I do. We never had sex. We barely even touched. We hugged hello and goodbye, and you rubbed my shoulders for a thoughtful moment the last time I saw you. As I was turning to leave, you gently stroked my cheek. But we’ve never shared a single erotic caress. This makes everything we did so much more erotic. The fact that you were trying so hard to be good, the friction of your struggle, as if you could barely contain the massive excitement you felt from simply sharing the same room as me – the idea that I was irresistible to you, so you didn’t trust yourself around me. All of this just turns me on. Remember when we got coffee, and I accidentally brushed the toe of my boot against your shoe? My boot! It was so thick that I barely felt it. I thought I had hit myself against the table. But you nearly jumped out of your skin. You said “No, no.” My god, you were so nervous! Now, as the haze of my own innocent and heady crush on you subsides, I finally see what was going on: sexual tension. It was so thick and delicious, you could have cut it with a knife and eaten it for dinner. It would have comfortably served four. Yes, you love your wife. Of course, neither of us wants to hurt her. We cherish our friendship too much. You respect my mind and admire my taste in poetry. But none of that changes the fact: you want to fuck me. You desperately want to shove your dick into my tight wet 24-year-old vagina over and over again. You want to touch me in all the places you’ve never seen and only imagined in your dirty poetic mind. You want to take my small soft hands in yours, and guide them all over your body, showing me where and how you like to be touched. You want to gently stroke my cheek while thrusting yourself into me and kissing my breasts and neck. You want all this and I want it too. I want to feel you climax, to watch the look of agonizing pleasure on your face as you feel me gripping you in my own orgasmic pulses. I want all of this more than you can even imagine – and I know you can imagine a lot. As you said, it doesn't matter what we want. It just isn't a good idea. But I don’t think I’ll be able to forget about what never happened.

It's been three years to the day since I watched you take your last breath. We laid there on that hot asphalt, our fingers entwined; your sweet, pale blue eyes looking deeply into mine. You had said, ""Don't worry. Everything will be fine."" For a moment, I believed you. Those beautiful dimples had never lied to me in the 15 years we'd been side by side, so with all of my heart, I believed you for that fraction of time.

I can't forget the feel of that heat, or the piece of metal sticking through your side. The way that your lips felt perfect, even if I covered them in blood from my split lip. Your eyes stayed bright until the end, and I wish I had said so much more than, ""I know. Penelope will be so angry with us for being out so late, though. I love you, even if you cause nothing but mischief."" That dog *was* mad, but with me, and for not bringing you home from that hospital.

I heard the sirens as I spoke. They were so close when that last breath came. I can still hear them running. I was so glad that your last breath was spent on that laugh, even if it was just about our dog. As that laugh finished, and you slipped away from me forever, I heard my world shatter and the pieces have never rejoined.

I miss you, and I still love you with every ounce of my being. Penelope still waits by the door at 4:38 every afternoon, whining about when you'll be home; I always wait with her. I think you've caused enough mischief, don't you? When are you coming home to us? I'll even let you turn on that horrible fashion show I always hated. Just... come home.

Dear sweetheart,

Dear darling,

Let me hurt for you.

Let me take my courage, for it’s really all I have, and shed light on this dark existence you seem so content with.

I know what pain is. Far better then I wish I did. I've had my share of suffering. But I’m strong. I’m cheerful and I’m optimistic. I can take it. Give me your pain and your hurt, your loneliness, your desperation, your sadness, your anger, your jilted heart.

Let me *feel* for you what you refuse to let yourself feel.

Let me show you what love and happiness and comfort truly are.

Let me in.

I will wait forever, until you feel safe telling me. I’ll wait until the rain stops brightening the petals of the sun kissed lilies and tulips, until darkness brings security instead of fear and the clouds sink into the ocean. I’ll wait until the moment I stop breathing to be a complete part of your life.

You've trusted me with your broken, betrayed heart. You've trusted me with your love and your happiness, your 
intelligence, your hobbies, your dreams, and your desires. But you won’t give me that hurt part of yourself. You don't think that part, any part of you, deserves love or acceptance.

You can't see yourself clearly. You spend your day staring at the murky reflection of your half formed self-concept, choked out to you daily from the mouths of the incompetent bastards who take advantage of your giving, pure nature.

I hold in my hands an incomplete puzzle. I see not a full person in public, but the tattered shadow of the form you wish to extrude. The world sees what you show them, but I see all the dirty, mud splattered bits you try so hard to keep hidden.

Life and its people have so carelessly trampled your gifted, loving soul and I don’t know if I have the ability, warmth or subtly to mend what is now so cracked and fragile. But I will take my time, every small breath I will dedicate to mend this shining source of fame.

Let me give you all the love and care that I tried so desperately to give others. They struggled in ways that were not for me to meddle in. I couldn't do anything for the most important people in my life. I was forced to leave them behind because I didn't know how to help them.

But I've learned your patterns and heart in ways I never knew theirs. I've learned my lesson from those failures and short comings, from those deaths. And I've learned them, shouldered the weight of this guilt and sense of insecurity, to be here for you. I was made to be what you need.

Please let me be that.

Let me be what you so desperately deserve and want.

Let me be what you won't let yourself have.

Let me love *every* part of you, past, present, future; success, failure, procrastinator; happiness, sadness, pain. I want all of you. And I always will. There is nothing you could ever say or show me that will drive me away. I've already discovered your darkest secrets and hidden emotions. I know you, far better than you know yourself. I've known from the moment you first spoke. And I love what I saw, I love what I see now.

You are worth more than I will ever be able to describe. You are worth more than any metaphor or simile that springs to mind with cliche intensity that I could possibly write down. You are beautiful and priceless. You are talented and gifted, generous, loving, gentle, warm, caring, genuine, fierce, brilliant, wild, unpredictable, indescribable, and perfect in your wholeness and your flaws.

Never in the bad way, but in the way where people remember you from the last party and go, ""that guy's crazy!""  You always did a bit more drugs than the rest of us, but we were all doing drugs.  It was obvious that you were chasing away some demons.  But fuck we all were in our own way.  Who could say anything?  Whose right was it to judge?

I started to worry when you took up injecting ketamine.  I kind of knew it was a bad line to cross.  Pricking yourself with a needle to get off is, for some reason, over a certain societal line.  It's a level of self-disregard that portends worse things.  

I remember the first time I watched you do heroin.  It was you and I and two other guys who I had no real affection for.  I wanted to be cool with it.  I mean, we all did whatever we could get our hands on.  Not doing heroin was a failure of mine and not the other way around.  After all, you were only snorting it, so it couldn't be that bad.

You guys all took your bumps from the little envelope and laid back to watch TV.  It kind of smelled like flowers.  You were all silent for about 15 minutes before a few comments started to trickle out about whatever we were watching.  Each comment was always met with ""dude shut up, you're killing my high.""  Turns out heroin is not a social drug.

Around then was when the crew drama started.  The truth is... I fucking hated Mike.  I didn't give a fuck if you told his girlfriend he cheated on her.  I was bound by stupid fucking guy rules to act outraged and play along.  I had to drive those idiots to your house so they could ""jump you.""  Those fucking pussies couldn't do anything and didn't.  I'm sorry I enabled that pathetic attempt at a beatdown.

The guilt I still carry in my heart to this day is that I used it as an excuse to push you away.  I was scared of watching you become a junkie so I used it as an excuse.  

Then came the jail time.  That was inevitable wasn't it?

That night we bumped into you out on the town... you were scary.  Intense and vivid, more lucid than I'd ever seen you, in a scary way.  You couldn't have been any more forgiving the way you greeted us and said we should hang out.  I was still scared.  Our other friend secretly stayed friends with you and kept us up to date.  I could have started hanging out again but I didn't want to.  

He told us you were using again.  He told us he warned you.  Everyone knows when you kick and then start using again is when the OD's start.  

You must have known it too.

You were too fucking strange and beautiful to exist in this world.  I'm sorry I couldn't be around.  I wasn't strong enough.

Still thinking of you.

It's not so much that we weren't able to talk, it's just that we never seemed to need to.

For everyone, there are constants, people that are always present in their lives.  People who help them grow. 

Today, my biggest constant is my wife and my second one is my daughter.

It's normal, I live with them.

But when I was a kid and was living with my family, they weren't my constants. How could they? They kept me down. They prevented me from growing, from living, from being myself.

My constant, you know it, and I know it even thought we never spoke of it, was you.

It's simple. The years we were in touch, I grew. The years we weren't, I didn't. Well, it's not that simple because sometimes, life just is too complicated to be shortened like that.

Well, you knew that. I think in a way, you taught it to me.

You had the perfect family. Two adorable younger sisters. A perfect loving mom who was a much better mom to me than mine ever was. Even a dad who could talk and love, something I never really knew anywhere else.

I grew up in a train wreck. You knew that. I knew that, even thought we never spoke of it.

But we didn't have to. How many times did I eat breakfast with you while both of our families were asleep during the summer?

How many times did I sleep in the basement, in your older sister's room because I simply was better in your house than in mine, just as your older sister was better in your younger sister's room for the night than sleeping in her room in the basement.

Of course, officially, I was only there because I had missed the last bus after we moved, or because it was too late to walk home when I was still living close.

But the truth was that in your cold basement, two full floor levels under your family, in a bed that was made just for show and not for sleeping, I slept better than in my house next door to my own family.

But I didn't really know that back then. I think you did. I know you mom did, she told me recently. She also told me you and her never talked and that she feels as thought talking to me was like talking to you.

Perhaps that why you became roommate with Max as an adult. He doesn't talk and he doesn't need to have you talking. You could just be roommate and both pretend like you were good friends to the outside world.

But I know it was a lie. Max told me, even thought he didn't need to. Max just told me one day that you and him had never really had a full conversation.

It didn't  surprise me. Because you and I never really had that conversation, didn't we?

I think the only difference between me and him, is that our relationship didn't really need words. We bonded and spoke without talking.

I am not sure anyone ever got that.

Remember when you threw your monopoly board across the room? That was the only time I had seen one of your famous fits of rage.

When you were about to explode near me, you tended to just look at me and our eyes would meet and you would calm down.

But not that day. That day, I wasn't looking at you. I was looking at her. At my ex. 

So nothing calmed you down. You threw the board up and ran to your room, leaving your guests, our friends, in the living room.

No one understood. They all looked at me for guidance. They all asked me to go talk to you after you locked yourself in your room.

But what good would it have done? We didn't talk. That's not how it worked between us. 

But they couldn't understand that and they couldn't understand why you threw the board. I did. I even understood before you threw it. I didn't know you would do it, but I understood.

I think you knew I understood. I think that may be why you didn't look at me when you threw the board. Maybe it wasn't my ex in the way. You couldn't face me. Not that day.

Because that was also the day you told me it wouldn't last with her. That she was wrong for me. Well, you didn't say it. You thought it, and that was enough for me. You knew I understood, and I knew you knew I understood even thought not a single word was said.

 It lasted a few more weeks but she dumped me. Perhaps she knew I knew.

And I did know it. Just like I knew you approved of the next one. I married her, you knew, you were there.

You weren't my best man. Sometimes I regret it. Sometimes I feel like it was justified.

It's not that we weren't closer, but rather that I chose the man who would do the best toast in our honour.

Can you imagine yourself making a toast? 

I thought you knew. But I wasn't sure and when I checked with you, a few years later, you just put your hand on my shoulder and I instantly knew you knew.

It was like that. No one else understood that. In a way, I am grateful, but I have that with my wife too, except that we also talk.

But then again, with you, it wasn't needed, was it?

You taught me English that way. Did you ever realize it? I am sure you did. Without you, I wouldn't speak English as well today. I am currently pouring my thoughts in a language I wouldn't master without you.

Well, I guess it's true for a lot of things, including playing sports and being a geek. Without you, I wouldn't even know that you need practice to do sports.

Ridiculous isn't it ? My family sure didn't teach me that. You did.

You don't remember? Think about the tennis balls. It's that stupid. We never even talked about it. It just happened. I arrived one morning at your house and you were bouncing the tennis ball on the wall and suddenly, I understood why you were so good at school during recess.

You simply practiced.

It had never occurred me. 

I am a software developer.  Do you remember when I helped you on your old computer when we were kids ? I do. 

I am pretty sure you were better than you let on. I think you detected an interest in me and helped me cultivate it. Those days, we weren't even 12, you helped me build my career.

When your left knee began to hurt, your doctor heard about it. I head about it. No one else heard about it. I didn't know that. You knew I didn't know that.

A few friends of ours heard about the accident. I was the only one who knew you and who knew that your left knee hurt like hell. Hey, I was the only one who knew how it happened.

But I didn't know that.

How could I have known that? We had a special relationship. I knew that. You knew that. We never had to speak about it.

But I didn't know even your wonderful mother didn't know about your knee injury. I swear. I didn't. I know you know I didn't. Don't ask me why I now know this. Words cannot convey it.

I did know however that no one knew about your later right knee injury. I know because I saw you cry that one time you helped me. The only time in over 20 years I ever saw you cry.

You made me swear not to mention it. Not by words, but I knew it nonetheless. There was something in your eyes.

You were holding your right knee. You were hoping I didn't notice it was a different knee, but you knew I knew. And that day, I realized that you would never be able to play volleyball again.

I am not sure many would have understood anyway. You were the geek, the nerd, the intellectual. Many of my friends who didn't know you called me that, but never once they met you.

It was uncontested. No one in their right mind would call me the intellectual when I was next to you. I knew it. You knew it, but we never spoke of it because it just didn't matter. We connected and that was what was important.

But we weren't the nerds they thought we were. I was good social skills. I made girlfriends, married one. I had gangs, hundreds of people in my life who called me their friend.

You had your sports. But that's the thing. No one who knew you in life except me knew about the sports.

No one who knew you in sports knew about your life. I didn't KNOW that. I never met your sport friends. None of us did.

But you told me their names. And you talked to me about them. Like you never talked about anyone else. And I could feel you being different. Like a jock born with a big brain.

In fact, that was pretty much all you really talked about, if it comes down to it. Sports, you talked. Physics and geekdom, we lived. 

Well, we did talk. It's not like you were mute or silent. But you said so much more without words that sometimes I thought I imagined it, and then ,there would be this conversation which would cement in my mind that we did have an understanding.

Then, one day, you mom called me. My wife and I were in bed, watching TV. I remember it vividly. It was 21h37. The Simpsons were over for 7 minutes and Family guy was on.

You mom was asking when was the last time I had spoken to you. It had been on the Friday, over lunch. I almost always called you after lunch. Sometimes you answered, other times you didn't. 

That day, you did. I remember hearing about your plans on Saturday night, to go watch the game at the bar you liked to hang with your volleyball friends.

I knew the name of the bar back then and I told your mom. I forgot it now, but I was the only one who even knew about the bar. I didn't know that.

That Friday, we talked about Scrubs. We talked about House MD, then in the first season if I remember properly. We talked about my day. We actively didn't talk about your day. That was the routine. 

We followed it perfectly, but I didn't know what it meant. I swear, I didn't. Maybe you tried to use our special connection so I could guess what was about to happen.

But I didn't sense anything. Perhaps I was in a rush. For years, I used to beat myself up for not realizing something was wrong. But what was the use? You didn't talk. It's not my fault. I didn't set the tone of our relationship. You did.

Your mother cried of joy when she heard we spoke on Friday. She was relieved. As if having spoken to me solved everything.

I told about your plans on Saturday. I couldn't know no one else knew about them. I couldn't know you had this part of your life just to you and by extension, to me.

Your mom was confused. She didn't know about the volleyball team. She didn't.

Tuesday, she called me again. Said they found you. Well, they identified you. They had found you Saturday morning, but I guess you didn't want to ruin anyone's week-end and left your wallet at home, on the table. You only brought your keys to lock the door.

Why? They wondered at first. Why bother to even lock the door? But you were a creature of habit. You even did the dishes. Even your mom didn't understand why.

But I did. You didn't want her to have to do it. I knew that. I know you knew I would know it.

Instead, she cried loudly sitting at your kitchen table, when it was just the two of us. The rest went to the morgue. I wanted to go, but I couldn't abandon your mother. She would have been left all alone in your apartment.

We spent 30 minutes together and we managed to get the first full image of who you really were. Even your father doesn't know what happened in those 30 minutes. Your sisters either. 

I didn't know that your mother had never been to your apartment. She had been to Max's apartment when you had been with him. But not to that one. No one had. Not even Max. Only me. Did you know already when you moved there? Probably not.

I couldn't bear it alone, so I spoke of it to my wife, but she didn't know you enough. She didn't know US enough. She knew me, but couldn't tell the difference between which parts of me are original and which parts grew with you.

You mother could. You mother could see you in me, and me in you. 

The official police report say that you stopped talking your calls and answering your door on the Thursday, after 13h00. Mike called you then and you didn't answer. We hadn't spoken that day, so I don't know what to think of it.

But you didn't answer your phone or your door that Thursday, even to your landlord. And yet, you weren't out that Thursday. You told me on Friday, during my call. Why would you have lied about that when you never lied to me?

I think you had decided to do it on Friday morning. I think Thursday was your last day, but I didn't call.

So I think you waited for my call on Friday, because you answered for me. You knew if was me, even if you didn't have caller id.

You knew, because like you, I am a creature of habit. I use to leave for lunch always at the same time and call my wife as soon as my car left the parking lot. You, I would call on the drive back.

You knew that. You could count on that. But I didn't call on Thursday. Perhaps I didn't have the time. Perhaps my wife called me. Perhaps my phone batteries were dead.

So, you waited until I did call, on Friday and we spoke. Of nothing.

Did you hope I would know? I bet you did. Did you hope I would eat with you like I often did? You knew I couldn't on Fridays. 

I guess you had hoped for a Thursday meal and gave me a last chance on that Friday.

Of perhaps you wanted to hear my voice for the last time.

I don't know. Because you see, suicide is something I will never understand.

I love life. I do. You knew that. I knew that you knew that.

I now think that perhaps, I managed to teach you that. To show you the beauty in life.

But your knees made you blind again. The pain made you forget about life. The suffering made you jump, that day.

You didn't leave a note. It's not your style. But I know why you did it. Officially, it was your knees, but I know it's deeper than that.

It took me years to finally do it, but your mom now also knows why you did it. I had to tell her. She was sure she had failed you. She didn't.

My wife also knows about it, even if she doesn't know you.

But the others, they lack understanding. Unlike me, they didn't know you. Unlike me, they could only hear the words.

But today, when I talk to them, to anyone, I only see the words too. I search for more, but I can't find it anywhere outside of my house.

But today, I miss you. I miss that special connection which made me whole. Which made me who I am.

Because you see, I cannot say goodbye to you. You are simply too much in me, and I was too much in you. When you jumped, a part of me also died.

First slowly and then completely my gaze will change from exploration to utter adoration. Something will be both noticeably yet indescribably different about the electricity our bodies generate when pressed together - intimately or otherwise. I’ll subtly grab you like I haven’t seen you in months, though I’m trying to keep it a secret, when I fall into your arms each time we meet. In the morning my face will poorly conceal the minor heartbreak of starting the day by leaving you - a heartbreak which is relieved only slightly by the warmth of affection transferred from your lips to mine. When I’m completely drunk with emotion I will write to you, transferring our  momentary experience of love into a permanent record that can be relived on demand. 

Lets settle in somewhere on the other side of the globe only to leave again after a short while to return to our daily adventures: exploring nature, city, and each other. If you are curious and open enough to encourage my intellectual and physical wanderlust, to follow your own, to volunteer as a passenger and to drive the bus now and then, we’ll build an incredible journey together. Dream big and I will support you at every turn, fall, and triumph so long as you vow to do the same. Be my partner in crime, but continue to live your life independently of me - I fully intend to have a life outside of the one I have with you.

But to be with me you have to be 100% certain you don’t need to create any (more) little versions of you to feel complete. Motherhood is simply not for me. I would have considered giving up everything for the man in my last serious relationship had children not been an issue. But it was, and we both knew neither he nor time would change my mind.

I’m under no illusion that this will be forever. If it is, and we’re happy, then that is so lovely.

Nearly five years ago, you first slipped your hand into mine. I was dating your friend, but I felt a tingle inside me that made me wonder and that next morning, you and I walked along the beach together. You put your arm around me and we talked. Just talked. I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t know what I wanted.

Eventually though, things progressed. You’d come over on Sundays and we went from hanging out, to making out, to eventually fucking, and it was the best sex I’ve ever had. The way you’d say my name would make my body ache with desire. I still imagine you saying it, in that seductive way you did, as I fuck him instead of you. 

You would text me, late at night when you were drunk and I’d quietly leave him in bed to go online to chat with you. I didn’t realize it then, but I was falling in love with you. It seems so obvious now.

When one of us felt guilt, we’d spend months apart. And during one of those periods, he proposed, and we got engaged. I thought you and I were done. But I couldn’t help myself. Imagining you inside me made me contact you, and I thought you wanted me as much as I needed you.  Sometimes, you’d jokingly say that you wished you had met me first. I didn’t know if you meant it or not. If you had only asked me to leave him for you, I would have. But you never admitted to really caring about me, and we’d just say we’d never work out. 

When I finally got married, you seemed happy for us. But when I saw you a few days later, and you cried in that elevator, I wanted more than anything to just tell you what a huge mistake I’d made. But you didn’t say you wanted me then either. I don’t know why. Was it pride? Fear of rejection? Didn’t want to ruin your friendships? I wish you had just been honest then.

When you told me we couldn’t see each other any more, you were cruel. You called me all sorts of names. You swore that you’d never cared about me at all. I believed every word, and it broke me. You had never outright told me that you cared about me. I thought you only wanted to see me for the amazing sex we’d have. I ached for a long time, and eventually, I just let myself forget you. You’d hurt me too much.

You dated other people. We didn’t talk much. Then, you came over for the party, left, and sent me a text. 

“I miss you.” 

I knew what that meant, but I deflected. You were seeing someone and you had hurt me too much.

Just one month later, when I found out he’d been seeing someone else, it was you I turned to. You would understand. Even though you’d been dating someone for six months now, I knew you’d be there for me. And when I told you I was thinking of having sex with someone else, that’s when you said what I’d wished you’d said. I told you that having sex would be a bad idea. You said you wanted to do it anyway. I said, but why? Your response?

“Because it’s us. Because it’s you. It’s always been you.”

And we had sex that next day. You apologized for breaking my heart me. I cried. We had sex again and again. Then, it was time for me to go, and she called you. The hurt on your face is something I will never forget, and that is why I now am not a part of your life. 

But I love you. Not picking you was the biggest mistake of my life. You will always be my what if. You will always be the one I fantasize about spending my life with. You will always be the one I imagine having sex with. 

And next time you say that you miss me, I will be right there, ready to be with you. 

In one month, I will see you for the first time in 8 months. 

This wedding is going to be fucking awkward.

I stayed in our horrific marriage for FIFTEEN FUCKING YEARS! Now, more than 10 years later, you have everything, and I have PTSD. All the years of physical, verbal, and psychological abuse has left me damaged in ways I'm still trying to understand, and recover from. The worst, however, was when you realized I was serious about the divorce, and that I felt nothing for you anymore. That was when you took my kids from me, and me from them. You didn't want them. You just knew that was the one last thing you could do that would hurt me on a level no beating ever could. You took the kids that didn't want to be with you. You took the kids that you verbally, and psychologically abused. The kids that I took care of 24/7 while you were out getting other women pregnant. The main reason I divorced you was to protect those children from you. To give them a quiet life. A emotionally stable life. To do for them what I should had done years before, but was too afraid to because I let you convince me that I was too dumb, too helpless, and too worthless to make it as a single mom of 4. The youngest was barely 5 years old, and we had never been apart! The kids and I had an amazing relationship. A bond you could never understand and were jealous of..and as your last demonstration on ""power"", you took them. You lied in mediation. You lied in court. How the judge ignored the police pictures of what you did to my face, I'll never understand.  You lied, and you got everything. You got the house, and you got my children. To this very day, I don't know how that happened. Now, here we are, 10 years later, and the pain from that is still so intense that it feels like it all just happened yesterday. You knew I didn't give a shit about not being with you, so you took the only things that I loved, and you know what? You didn't deserve them, and they sure as hell didn't deserve to be alone with you. They called me crying all the time, and all I could do was cry too. I was helpless.. I couldn't protect them from you, and it killed me. I only got to see them 8 days a month. We were together 24/7. The little one still slept with me, and I only had 8 days a month. The first year is a blur. All I remember is crying all the time, and wanting to die. I fought you with everything I had, but you had the money so you had the best lawyer. My lawyer was shit. By the time it was all over I'd been through 5 lawyers! It took time, but eventually, I got the kids almost half the time, and when the oldest turned 14, she moved in with me. You made your threats, but that's what little, insecure, scared men like you do..you threaten those smaller and weaker than you, like kids, women, and animals. Do you remember what you did to any pets we tried to have? I do. Do you remember all the times you blocked your number, and called me over and over again, while you were jerking off in the bathroom? I could hear you breathing, and the sound of you masturbating, and it made me sick.  Do you remember the times you knew I was broke and would call and offer to help me financially if I met you at a hotel and fucked you? The thought makes my skin crawl to this day. You owed me $20, 000 from the divorce settlement, and you still had the nerve to offer me money only if i fucked you. So, jump ahead to now. The kids are grown. One is married, and the twins are engaged. The youngest is about to turn 18, and is with me as often as she can be. I recently found out, from her, that you let her think I left her because I wanted to. She spent her entire childhood thinking I left her behind by choice. Of course I cleared that up. She cried, I cried..do you have any idea of the damage you've caused that little girl?  Have you suffered at all? No, you haven't because you aren't capable of feeling anything real. You go through the motions. You lie to yourself, and you believe your own lies. Now, you've bought a new house, with the money coming in from the business we started together, but that I was fucked out of in the divorce. You're about to marry a woman with 2 young kids, which makes me sad because you have no business being around kids at all. You have guest houses on your property where our twin sons live, with the girls their about to marry. Somehow, in all this, you've decided that you're a Christian, and have, along with your girlfriend, been baptized. Do you know what a joke that is? The boys tell me you send them texts not as yourself, but as Jesus. It infuriates them. The say you tell them god talks to you. Maybe you've finally lost it.  Your most recent proposition of sex for cash wasn't more than a month ago. Did you tell god about that, you hypocritical piece of shit? How did a piece of fuck, such as yourself, wind up with everything? When do you pay for all the pain, and suffering you've caused, and continue to cause? How do you have it all, and I have nothing? I did the right things, for the right reasons, and it all went horribly wrong. You did everything wrong, and got away with all of it. My sons' fiancees call your future wife the ""best mother in law ever"", and call you dad. It kills me. My life is filled with anxiety attacks, and a fear of pretty much everything. Its hard for me to even leave the house sometimes, and its been like this for the past 5 years. The first 5 after the divorce, I was so much better but it was because I pushed down all the pain. I convinced myself I was over the abuse, and I was over the heartbreak of losing my kids. Then, it all came crashing down, and so did my life. How is this fair? My doctor says I have PTSD from you, and at times, its paralyzing. I feel like total failure as a mother, which kills me because at one time, it was the only thing I was good at. I was a great mother, and the kids have told you that. Now, I'm broke, and I'm broken...and you, you smug, son of a bitch..you have everything. I don't see, or talk to our sons nearly enough because I feel so terrible about myself that I assume they do too. I feel like they're as ashamed of me as I am. I don't know how to change this. I'm intelligent, decent looking, a good person, with a huge heart..why did I let you do this to me? How did i let it get this bad. They say living well is the best revenge, but how do I even start putting my life back together. People tell me I need to put the past in the past, and forgive you. I've already forgiven the abuse. I've forgiven the cheating, and lying. I can't forgive you ripping my kids from me. I feel like a part of me died when that happened. I hate you for it. I want to let it go, but I hate you for what you did to them, and to me. I know 10 years is too long to hold on to this, but I don't know how to let it go. Especially since you suffer no consequences from any of your actions. I don't fucking get it..

You've fought your own monsters enough to recognize that everyone else is waging war as well.  And your innocent smile does little to mask the scars and tears.

You told me where I would be sitting and brought me there in case I got lost (we both know that place was a maze of cubicles!). Following that, we didn't really deal with each other in any official capacity, so it was rare for us to strike up a conversation. 

A couple of weeks into the job, I started to hang out with a particular group of people. We would have lunch together in one of the mezzanines. I immediately noticed that even though you were spending lunch in the mezz as well, you always isolated yourself. I asked one of my co-workers if we should invite you over to eat with us. This simple question opened a can of worms. People started telling me how difficult you were to work with, that you were strange and incredibly moody. They advised me to steer clear unless I was obligated to work with you on a project. And it just so happened that we needed to consult with one another on a project. I eventually saw the attitude that the others were referring to. Right away I closed myself off. We had a disagreement, and we stopped talking to each other completely. I'm ashamed to say that I went along with the rest of the herd, and said some angry things about you behind your back. To this day it's still something I really regret and think about a lot.

But then, something happened. We were placed on the same work team, and as a result, there was no way we could avoid each other. We were tasked to work on another project together, and we were pretty awkward around each other. That is until we realized we were acting like 5 year olds. And from that realization a new, somewhat tenuous relationship began to form. 

We began chatting to one another on a regular basis, and pretty soon I saw past your mask of cynicism. I saw you. The real you. The big hearted man that would bend over backwards to accommodate others. I then realized that no one had really taken the time to get to know you. 

Now, I look forward to seeing you at work. I know that if ever I'm upset about something, you're the first to offer a shoulder, and the first to make me laugh despite my bad moods. To think that after being total assholes with each other, we somehow grew to be so close. You're the only one that I feel safe opening up to, and the only one that I can act like myself around without fear of being judged. I only wish that I had come to my senses ages ago. I wish I hadn't listened to the silly gossip that always seems to travel around an office environment. And most importantly, I want to thank you for trusting me enough to feel comfortable opening up and letting me into your life despite the bitchy attitude that I used to convey in all of our dealings with each other.

I don't miss you everyday, hearing the songs, the words.. someone with your name doesn't make me flinch like it used to. But that space where you once were is still empty, it can never be filled and I've stopped trying. 

That day I thought the world stopped spinning, there was no air for me to lose. I had hoped this was like before and that we could go back, but this time you made sure there was no bridge to cross, we were done. 

I toyed with sending you this letter, appologising, explaining, reasoning with you. But you were always more practical than I was, am. I know you rationalised that you were doing this for me, but we both know this was to make it easier for you. You were always so headstrong. 

I don't remember the last time I was willing to wait like I waited for you and even though our time together was brief, you knew that. You knew everything about me, even things I had yet to admit to myself.

I deleted everything you know? I'm sure you did on the first day, your temper is so fierce, I know you did. It's so like you to bolt at the first sign of danger.

Fuck. Can we just talk? Can we just have an hour of madness where we laugh at Cosmo and we play RIFT on different servers while you complain about something I don't care about? Can we do that? Can we have one more day where we talk about nothing, argue about everything and love without reason?

I was so close to you, next to you today. I have never, seriously ever felt this way with anyone before. I really, honestly had to fight against putting my arm around you. I don't even understand where that desire came from, I'm usually so good and aware at controlling myself in these situations, but when I'm with you...there's so much I have to watch out for. I can do it though, don't worry. 

I don't mind. I love you for the person you are, and I know that probably sounds a bit strong considering our relationship, but you really are a beautiful, beautiful person. I want to learn so much from you, I already have with you hardly saying anything at all. I don't know anyone like you, but everything is, simply amazing now that I do. 

When I leave from seeing you, I am giddy, every single time. It always puts me in a good mood, I just love talking to you. You are wonderful. When I was younger, I would be sad when knowing I wouldn't see a person for a few days. With you, the time I spend with you is taken at face value, it is wonderful, I cherish it...so much. I suppose I am satisfied completely with what you give to me. And that's beautiful to me, that's amazing that I have something and someone like that in my life. 

Part of me wishes I could stop desiring you in every way possible, I know it would never ever work, but, I can't help it. I want to know every part of you, but in my most honest state, I'm fine with leaving things the way they are. I don't want to lose what I have gained with you, so, it's okay, it really is. 

But....well. If given the chance, I can't say I wouldn't be so easily persuaded... &lt;3

To be so kind and caring towards someone you hardly know must have been so challenging. I sat in the front of your class and got 100's on all the tests, was organized, and did every bit of homework without complaint. I was just a quiet kid. And somehow, you saw through the facade and knew that there was some unspoken turmoil in my life.

You would clap me on the shoulder and ask how I was, and you were the first person to say, ""You're not really that convincing,"" after I told you I was fine. You always told me that you would be there for me if I wanted to talk. It wasn't until the end of the year I told you I wasn't fine anymore, and when you asked if you could help, I said no.

I thought that would be the end of it, but you surprised me my Junior year. You switched from Geometry to Gym, and when you saw me you came and hugged me. Asked me how I was. And you assured me, again, that you'd always be there to talk to if I needed an ear.

Finally, I did. I told you everything. I told you about the cutting, the depression, the mental abuse and neglect in my home, my loneliness, everything. I cried, because I had never trusted anyone like that before. I was scared you would react terribly. But you didn't.

Throughout the year you counseled me. You told me how amazing I was. You told me cutting wasn't the end of the world, and you understood it was just a coping method. You checked my grades and told me I was a great student. You told me that you hoped your daughter would grow up to be strong like me. For the first time in 16 years, I felt like I almost had a dad again.

You made me promise that no matter how bad things got.. you hesitated. No matter how bad things got, to promise you I wouldn't do anything rash. I paused, because I knew that you meant suicide. But I promised you. I knew what that promise meant, and it has saved my life.

After DYFS was called I had to move 3,000 miles away. At the time, your daughter needed surgery. I never got to say goodbye, and I was horribly devastated. I e-mail you from time to time, but I can never seem to mention those days again and how thankful I was.

There will never be enough thanks in the world to express how grateful I truly am. You always knew how shy I was, so if you happen to come across this, then surely you'll know I was nervous about sending it.

Dear stranger from the train,

I got on the train after you and you went straight in to stand by the door instead of sitting down. Maybe your stop was just the first stop and you didn't want to go through the trouble of sitting or something. Anyways, I passed you and you had a look of sadness. You could have been just super into your music or just non-emotional but I clearly remember a sign of depression when I looked into your eyes. I know depression. I've experienced it and been there. I saw you another time and you had the same exact look in your eyes.

I wish I could have talked to you or made your day brighter. But who am I to assume you're sad? Also, I'm that shy introverted person who can't spark up a random conversation with a stranger. I really hope that bright optimistic extroverted guy talked to you and maybe cracked some jokes and made your sadness fade for a while. 

My friend told me a story of him sitting outside on campus alone when a professor came up and saw him and had a chat with him and gave him advice. I think we should strive more to be like that and talk to people who seem down. I think the world would be much better and happier if we could approach people like they aren't strangers and honestly ask them if they are okay.

Four years. Is that really all it's been? When I speak to you I feel like I'm coming home, like I'm coming back to somewhere warm and loving that will take me in its arms and sing me to sleep. 


My best memories are the times I've spent with you. Christmas day in the forest, eating puff-puffs until we threw up at one in the morning, giant bowls of pho, trying and failing to make cocoa, cold nights in the neighborhood park and that sweet, sweet date at the pizza place where we said more with our eyes and smiles than anything that came out of our mouths. (The Jamaican jerk pizza was fucking fantastic too, and don't think for a minute that I didn't see you eat more than half the goddamn thing you cheat. Love you.) We were minority kids in a white suburb with nothing to lose and no God to answer to, and we took what chained us to our setbacks and turned them on their head. We drank, we smoked, we lost our minds on mushrooms and molly and acid and did it all over again in the morning, and it was beautiful. Our bodies were ruined but our minds were fierce and electric and alive, more alive than anything in that dead cesspool! Politics, philosophy, reform, the environment, globalization, class warfare, institutional justice--our conversations roved and rambled and always left me begging for more, begging to pick your brain to see what other gems you kept locked in there. And I did. I learned everything about you, things that even you didn't know about you--what made you tick, how you worked, and the more I saw the harder I fell. You learned how many times people had wronged me, about just how much I had suffered under so many cruel hands. Didn't it bother you? Didn't it make you keep your distance? Not in the slightest. You took me as I was and made me feel whole again for the very first time in my wretched life.



So, so many times I've wished I could just reach over and hold you close, feel your warm skin against mine. A part of me dares to think you wouldn't mind.



I don't love you because you're beautiful (you are), because you're smart (you are), because you're funny (you are), or because you're witty or cynical or sassy or confident or any of those things. *Anyone* could love you for those reasons. But when I look at you, when I hear your voice so many miles away on the telephone, when I trace with my fingertip the smudged ink of your handwriting in your letters, it feels like sunshine is pouring right into my open veins. You--and I mean *all* of you, everything that you have ever seen, felt, touched, heard, smelled, the colors you like, the tears you've cried, the pangs in your heart, the quotes you love, the things you've learned and the places you've gone--I adore you. You are simply the most beautiful human being I have ever met in every aspect of that tiny English word that says so little but means so much, so very much. You're not perfect, but perfect can go to hell, because you are completely and entirely beautiful. Beautiful. Wonderful. Inside and out and all around. Sunshine in my veins, V.


Look at you. You're on top of the world at an Ivy League school. Nothing makes me happier than calling you up and hearing how fantastic you're doing, and I'm so fucking proud of you. I work hard for you. I am giving my life another chance because I want to be able to tell you one day that I am doing at least a fraction as well as you, to make you as proud as you have made me. But you know I'm dying. All the anger and rage and sadness and delusions and misery that have boiled over in my mind these past few years have aged me decades, and I feel like I can't take much more of this constant madness. I've wandered all over this world and still my mind will not leave me, no matter what hemisphere I desperately run to. There is no peace for me anymore, no peace at all; I feel like I can't escape the beating drum of my fate. Yet just hearing your voice can take it all away, if only for just a few minutes, and I know I can always call and let wave after wave of warmth and love wash over my tired, happy bones. But this cannot last, my love--I cannot last. I want to reach out, V, I want to burst forth in a blaze of color and sound and scream into your ears just how much I adore you--but I retreat, I pull back, I hide away in my corners and I live in silence. So my story goes.


I love you, so much, and I promise I will not leave this earth before I tell you--even if those words are the last ones to ever leave my lips.

I want to grab your almost non existent ass while I eat you out and slap it red while you ride me. I want to feel your awkwardly long legs around me. I want to pin your long, skinny arms up over your head when I fuck you. I want to grab your wonderfully long, pink cotton candy colored hair and look deep into your bright blue eyes while I cum inside you. That's my beautiful dark fantasy.

Ever since we first became friends I wished I wasn't in a relationship with your best friend. When she cheated on me with you, and then left you too, that's when we became friends. That's when I realized how amazing you were. How amazing our friendship could be. That's exactly how it is now. Amazing. I can only be sure the sex will be as great. 

I haven't been in a relationship with anyone since then but any girl I'm with, I imagine its you I'm kissing. I imagine its you I'm feeling up against my body. I don't want a relationship. I'd never date you because I don't want what we have to change. When I moved away, we used to talk all day and all night. We got drunk together over Skype. We discussed everything; sex, clothes, friends, beer, life. We have a wonderful friendship that I never want to change, but I want to fuck you. 

When I moved back, you got yourself a girlfriend. Now we don't have any of that. I know how happy you are with her and that you do your best to balance our relationship with your super busy life but I'm selfish. I don't even know the half of it. Maybe your girlfriend stops you from hanging out with me. 

I told you I didn't have feelings for you and that nothing could ever happen between us, and when you agreed, I wish you hadn't. I wish that the fact that every person you dated after we became best friends resembled me in some way meant something. I didn't realize it until you pointed this out and now its stuck in my head. 

I wish you'd move away with me for the summer.

Stop calling me lazy, stop yelling at me over little things. Stop trying to get me to go to church when you know I'm an atheist. 

Stop telling me to ""get a life"". I don't drive yet, you won't let me get a job, when I try to hang out and have a life, you start screaming at me to just shut up. I can't get a life until I can drive, which you won't even try to teach me how to do.

Stop being an asshole. I forgot to flip the fish in the ovenw hile you were gone. Big fucking deal! Did they burn? No, so why did you call me worthless? Why yell at all, , I mean it's not as if you caught me masturbating to a picture of Hitler.

Stop telling me that cussing isn't ladylike. Since when have been ladylike? 

Stop telling me to grow up. Dad, I grew up when Mom started neglecting me for drugs and you were off on business. I grew up when I had to make my dinners at seven years old. Don't try telling me that I shouldn't watch *My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*. Excuse me for watching an amazing show with good characters and good animation. Excuse me for trying to live the rest of my childhood for thirty minutes on Saturdays.

Our cat, Little E. The same cat who slept in my crib since I was a baby, the same that's sitting on my lap as I type this. Flame, Trouble and Annabelle, our new cats.

So the next time I fret about my babies, don't you **dare** tell me that they're just cats. 

Remember when Mufasa died? Not the lion, our cat. Remember how I didn't eat or talk or sleep for almost a month and I had to see a counselor? You know why?

I never really talked to you because I'm really shy. I didn't want to screw up whatever tiny thing we had going on, so I kept quiet. I'm pretty sure you thought I didn't like you, but believe me that is not the case.

Well, now fast forward to half a year ago. I was going through some rough times; I felt really lonely. Every day was monotonous and lonely. Until one day, even though I had not spoken a word to you in about a year, you said hi to me. That's it. You saw me from 50 feet away and called out to me. I knew at that moment that everything would be okay.

And now fast forward to one month ago. I asked you to the school dance. You said yes, probably just wanting to go as friends. 

Now one week ago. Well, when you put my arms around me to dance that night, I felt happier than ever. Looking back, it was the greatest night of my life, but it's only a memory now.

I haven't talked to you since, and I have no idea when I will talk to you again. But I hope it's soon. I want to hear your voice. I want to see your smile. I want to hug you and tell you just how much you've always meant to me.

Then I realise that that won't be happening anymore, then I get sad. The saddest part of it all isn't that, though. It's the realisation that I can no longer recall your routines and idiosyncrasies - I can't remember the way you'd return home after a day at work, or the way you like your drinks. 

It turns out that time does heal a lot more than people give it credit for...but thinking back, in retrospect, there never was anything that I needed healing.

I see this money as restitution for the terrible childhood I had at your hands. Since the money means so much to you, I will return it, but I also send this letter, so that you will understand why youll never meet your grandson.

You are terrible people, and terrible parents. Heres some of the why.

When I was 3 years old, I had issues taking naps at prescribed times. this is natural, because a 3 year olds sleep cycle isn't predictable. But what did you do? You forced me to run up and down the stairs over 50 laps. cardiovascular exercise does not make one sleepy, you dolts. in addition to not making me go to sleep, the exercise caused me to tear some of my abdominal muscles, resulting in the hernia that I had to go to surgery for. Didn't the doctor find it strange that a 3 year old had a hernia? that something that usually happens to older people. Im sure there were questions of abuse at the hospital. I know there certainly were within the family.

And what about that so called 'leaky stove pipe' that, as you told the doctor, caused my asthma? we both know it was your insistence on smoking two packs a day in the house with no open windows. 

when I was 4 years old, your shitty piece of shit boyfriend who later became my stepfather hauled me out of bed by my hair and spanked me til my ass blistered because I lied about a piece of candy I had stolen. 

when I was 5, we moved to California. it was norms idea and you went along with it. isolating us from any family who may have helped keep him from being his full blown self. because you sure as hell didn't stop him. remember the time I called back to Oregon, screaming that norm was going to kill both you and I? everyone else does.

I was never allowed to leave the house except for school. I wasn't allowed to have friends, I wasn't allowed to do anything normal. I wasn't allowed to make noise, or otherwise remind norm that I existed. as long as I was silent and forgotten, he was happy.

when I was 11, Adrian gave me 10 bucks for my birthday. I didn't tell you about it, and when you found it, norm hit my legs so hard the skin split and I bled. I had his hand prints on my thigh for two weeks. and you gave the money to the crackhead in the trailer park that, under torture, I claimed I had stolen it from. 

when I was 13, norm pulled me out of bed by my hair, dragged me to the kitchen and choke slammed me against a wall, and screamed at me for ten minutes about a glass that hadn't been washed. I went back to bed with the promise that next time, the glass would be broken and stored in my throat. even with how loud he got, you didn't wake up and come see what the commotion was. or maybe you pretended to be asleep.

for my 15th birthday, nobody came. I had no friends, no fun, nothing. you got me a yoyo and a bike. I was excited about the yoyo because I knew I could play with it. I wasn't excited about the bike because I already had a bike that you rarely let me ride. and no farther than 1/4 mile from the house. you were so indignant that I was ungrateful to receive this machine that we all knew I would never be allowed to use. so you took it back to the store and grounded me for two months for being ungrateful.


and none of this has included the mental abuse that was enacted upon me over the years. as soon as we arrived in California, norm was free to show his true colors. Every day, he would tell me how useless and worthless I was. he did it to you, too, but only during arguments. but me, I was unable to fight back, so I was his verbal punching bag. he told me at least three times a week that I was never going to amount to anything accept a prisoner. that I would never do anything with my life. Ha. look at me now. in the three years since I left high school, Ive accomplished more than either of you ever have.

and then we have the climax of my life with you. the night I left. I decided I was leaving that afternoon. I took 600 dollars, packed some clothes and food in a bag, and left out the window at 2 am. I rode my bike 6 miles in complete darkness. it was cloudy. so I had to feel the road out with my tires. I made it to a field. drank water fro someones sprinkler, and pitched my tent. I woke up again at 8 am. and walked the rest of the way to Hawkins Bar. I ate breakfast there and traded my recognizable brown coat for a black one. and I walked. I must have walked 15 miles before I got my first ride. rode all the way from Burnt Ranch to Weaverville, and walked another 5 miles through the town before catching another ride for 3 miles.  I finally caught a ride all the way to Redding, and bought a ticket to Vegas. people were nice to me, and I couldn't get enough. When I arrived in Vegas. a guy bought me a ticket the rest of the way to Michigan, saving me from having to spend the last of what I stole from you. And then I arrived in Michigan and called you. The first words you said were ""Why did you take the money?""


not, how are you, not where are you, not are you okay... Why did you take the money.

And so I came to the conclusion that you and your shitty asshole husband care more about your money than your family. Therefore, you can have your money on the assumption that I and my family will never have to hear from you again. This is me paying you to get the fuck out of my life forever.

But, I don't. I learned something, I came out on top, I'm not bitter about it. In fact, I think what we had -- at one point -- was absolutely beautiful, and I wouldn't take any of it back. Not even the fighting, the name calling, the screaming, the crying, the missed calls, the angry hang ups. And I sure as hell would never take back the day I let you go and walked away from the relationship we both dug into the ground. The day I was set free. 

You were my everything. I let you be my everything. 

And then I let everything go. 

And when you let go of everything, everything that's holding you to the burning ground, you're able to fly away. 

And I flew the fuck away. I flew away from the anxious hands strangling my lungs; the anxious thoughts crippling my brain; the anxious soul surrounding my heart. 

And when I swiftly landed back on solid ground I realized you never flew. You walked a bitter path. You moved forward and dragged your bitterness with you. While I flew, you harbored hate and then sprung it upon me.

I was ready to let you back in, to let you be a friend again. To forgive and not let the good times be wasted in the past, but instead reminisced together in a sweet, platonic way. I was ready to make amends. But seeing the hate you harbored, I didn't need to lift a finger. I didn't need to try make things right, because, why make things right with someone so wrong? 

You were my everything. You were my air. But I held my breath and you soon became toxic within me. And once I finally exhaled, you disappeared into the rest of the oxygen around me. 

You became nothing but a reoccurring memory that nags at me here and there when I'm reminded by a song, a sound, a smell. And soon, those memories will fade completely. Those songs will have new connotations, those sounds will be merely noise, and you will blend in more and more with the background, blend in more with the nothingness. You were my everything, and now you have become nothing. And nothing you will stay.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1k49df,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1k49df/my_everything/,

He didn't know we were going. He wasn't there at all today. Lost in his own mind. I drove his old blue truck that rattled and shook on the back roads. 

He use to take me out to the old place when I was younger. He could never play music but he said my mom would play for him while he hacked away for fire wood. 

I took her violin with us. 

It is just really a field now. The house is long gone. Just an old dirt driveway that leads nowhere, hugged on both sides by newly paved roads that make it ugly.  

I lifted her violin to play as he looked around trying to remember any piece he could. He called me her name and tried to tell me a story he couldn't quite remember. It was out here that she had told him about me as I grew in her belly. She would never tell him who my father was and it was a secret she took to her grave. In his eyes, my mother,  his ""sweetest gift"", and I will always be extensions of each other. Our stories that interlock and forever influence each other, even now that she is gone. 

"" I am pregnant."", I told him. I don't know if he noticed as he leaned against an old rusted metal fence looking for whatever he thought should be there. 

The tall grass scratched at my bare legs as I waited for him to respond. 

"" They haven't fixed the fence. The chain needs to be replaced "" is all he had to say, and then he walked the length of it up and down. I waited. 

My voice raised, "" I am getting rid of it.""

Quiet. No acknowledgement. 

He passed me and I reached out for his hand. He stopped. I threw my arms around him and cried and told him I loved him. 

He patted my back and laughed and said something about where his old dog was. Then he pulled away. 

He wandered down the dirt driveway further and I let him go. I stood there in the grass and the dirt, and I touched my belly and I cried.

How are you? 

This is a question I always, always ask when I see you. Not because I was being polite, it’s because I am genuinely curious. You always have that crease in between your eyebrows, and I always thought my presence would smoothen it out for you. It is why I am always chirpy and trying to hold your hand when I see you, to remind you I am always there for you.

But the crease, like a deep, bottomless river, never disappears no matter what I do. And I can’t bring myself to ask about the history behind your sadness. I don’t know what am I afraid of, because nothing can be worst than you telling me you don’t love me. 

Yes, I love you. As much as I tell myself to stay away from this, but like a moth attracted to the flames, I can’t help to want to heal your open wounds into scars, then into scabs, then hopefully one day its nothing but a beautiful mark from your past. 

I don’t think I can do this alone anymore. Loving you is like being stranded in Sahara, where you show me nothing but the prettiness and loneliness of this place and shower me occasionally with a few showers, then leave me fighting alone in the dark. You gave me hope by offering your presence, you made me really happy when we finally spend time together, but you also destroyed me when you left without saying anything. I don’t understand how can someone has such deep feeling towards another person without sharing the same mutual feelings. 

So, this is the last letter I wrote for you. A letter I never intend to send because like always, the last thing I want to do is to cause you any discomfort. You are a cruel man S, a good man nevertheless, but so, so cruel. I am tired of having so much feeling every time and thinking about you all the time, so I am squishing my feelings into this box and returning it to you.

You were more than just a best friend. You were the K to my C. You died. You were hit by a car. You were just trying to have a good night. I was going to text you that night, but I didn't. You know why? Jealousy. Fucking jealousy. You were posting pictures of you with your roommates, and like I told you in person, that made me so jealous. Love isn't suppose to be jealous, they say, but goddamnit, I was jealous.

On the anniversary of her death, you posted a picture of you two on Facebook and said, ""In my heart, you are still my very best friend."" I didn't even read that while you were alive, because even then, I was jealous of your old best friend.

I don't know why I have been so jealous of your other friends. I mean, you were jealous of mine, too. You hated every girl I hung out with, until you finally gave in and got to know them. It just hurts me that you aren't around anymore and I can't talk to you about this. How did you feel about your dead best friend versus me? What was the comparison? I never asked because it ALWAYS hurt me to hear you talk about her.

I wish I wouldn't have been so selfish. I just want to talk to you about it now. God, the regrets I have about that. I need to know. I need to know where you are and what you are doing. Are you and Lisa having a blast? I hope so.

My mom lost a lot of people in her life, and she use to tell me before she died that she hoped those people couldn't look down from Heaven to see the people they left behind.

Even though you weren't there, you'd know when it was. You knew everything about me. Holy fuck, you knew EVERYTHING. 

I've never had a friend that I could snuggle with. We use to be so gay for each other! God. I am so sad that I have been trying to grow up and do something with my life, so I've been not hanging out as often. I've been dating someone who doesn't drink or like to do much of anything, so if I wasn't working or going to school, I still wasn't hanging out. I went through ALL of my texts. They go back to August. So many nights you were begging me to come over and drink. I just never did. I was always at home with the boyfriend watching movies. I broke up with him, by the way. He doesn't understand my pain, and I was sick of him watching me cry.

I just hope that you loved me as much as I love you. And I hope that you know how much I love you.

I have never believed in God, but I want to now. You didn't believe either, but holy shit, I just want to see you again. I need to have my best friend. My heart is truly broken. I feel like there are a million knives in my chest and scorpions in my stomach when I think about you.

You were El Ten Eleven, I was Explosions in the Sky. You were Marlboro lights, I was Marlboro reds. You were red wine, I was white wine. You adored your feet, I adored my hands. You were Nissan, I was Honda. You were Domino's, I was Little Caesar's. You were chicken spaghetti, I was chicken gumbo. You were creamer, I was sweet-n-low. You were dogs, I was cats. You lost Lisa, I lost you. You were Katy, I was Cady.

I still have the scar on my left wrist that matches the scar on your left wrist. The one we made on ourselves, together, so that we'd never be without one another. I am without you now, and I am hurting.

You really don't realize what a fantastic person you are. If asked, you say the only thing that makes you special is that you're fairly intelligent. But, you don't see that ""fairly intelligent"" doesn't even cut close. You are beyond all doubt the most intelligent person I've ever met. And it's not only academic intelligence. It's like you effortlessly know the solution to absolutely any problem. I've seen your friends come to you with the most ridiculous problems, and after only one conversation with you, that problem is either solved, or on its way to being solved. And man, that knowledge! It's for good reason you've been dubbed a ""walking lexicon"". But you don't show off, I don't think you even realize it. You just answer any question you're asked. 

And jesus, you are so talented. No, your intelligence is not the only thing that makes you special. Talented in what, you ask? Anything and everything! One day, you randomly decide you want to learn something. Things you've never done before. And effortlessly, you just.. learn them. The most recent example is drawing. You just wanted to learn drawing one day, and a few days later you were sketching great portraits that looked nearly professional. And you ripped them apart because you thought they weren't good enough, and stopped drawing because you said you would never be good at it. 

You're also beautiful. Out of this world beautiful. It's effortless. That rocking body, and a beautiful, angel-like face. But you don't see it. You criticize yourself so harshly, it makes me want to cry. Because you treat everyone so well, except yourself. The things you say about yourself, if someone said them about anyone and you heard, you'd probably kick their ass. Wouldn't even have to be someone you know, and it could even be true, but you just have some sort of protector-gene, and try to take care of everyone you meet. 

Your friends are the luckiest people on earth. Really. And they know. Because no matter what is going on in your life, if they need you, you're there for them. And you near magically fix their problems. Everything you have, you share. You give all you have, and you just light up the world for everyone who knows you. And I mean that. 

You told me once that you expected to die alone. But that that was alright, because you realized a long time ago that nobody could ever love you. You're wrong, you know? Everybody loves you. You're the most important person in the world to a lot of people. You've saved many lives, and made so many more better. 

I still can't believe I even met you. It seems unbelievable that in a world so screwed up, in a town so depressing and small, I managed to find what might possibly be the most perfect human being in existance. 

But you don't see it. You refuse to believe anything positive anyone ever tells you. I wish you could just realize the truth, because it hurts to see you treat yourself this way. I don't want to see you in this amount of pain. I don't want to wake up every morning and have my first thought be ""Is she still alive?"". You've almost taken yourself away from us so many times, and over the last few years the light in your eyes has been slowly fading. It's a shame, because there is nothing greater than when you are happy. Amazing as you are, you grow even more amazing when your mood is good. 

It's not fair that this has to be happening to you. I wish I could take your pain upon me, god knows I deserve it. 

I don't know what more to say. Stay amazing, my dear, and I promise you, you will find someone who makes you as happy as you make everyone around you. I just wish that could be me.

I think I love you. And I hate you. You’re an anti-feminist, cissexist, heteronormative asshole. You’re misogynistic and rude. You’re one of those popular assholes from high school that never even had to deal with the possibility that everyone hated you for something beyond your control; you just took for granted that you were normal and ok and maybe even better than average. You’ve never been insecure and lonely and scared and suicidal and fucking depressed in your entire life. I can tell because it only took one little accusation to break you. It shook me too, I’m not saying it was fun or easy but seriously dude it’s fucking over. I can’t believe that your life is so fucking charmed that that was the worst thing that ever happened to you. You don’t even know, you’ve got miles and miles of privilege and luck surrounding you, you can’t even come close to experiencing the depth of pain that I’ve felt. You don’t want to hear it either, you hide behind insults and derailing tactics to avoid the truth. You’re FUCKING LUCKY and you don’t see it, you’ve got so much privilege you’ll never know you have it. I HATE YOU! I hate your sarcasm and your “jokes” and the way you say the word faggot. I hate how I act when I’m around you and the way I feel when you turn me down. I hate not knowing how you feel about me, and I hate knowing how I’ll never be quite human in your eyes, because that’s how you see the queer and the female-bodied, even (especially?) when you know that they don’t feel female. I hate knowing that you don’t even realize how hurtful you are. I hate knowing that we can never be together because of these things, and you had so much potential, how did you turn into this person I hardly know? Or did I ever really know you at all. Maybe I’m just seeing a more authentic you, this isn’t a new development, you’ve always been accidentally cruel and blinded by the awful glare of society. I thought you were intelligent and perceptive enough to see through all that, but it looks like you’re just another intellectual bastard in deep disguise. I’m ashamed that you fooled me, and I’m sad for you because you genuinely think you’re right, and you are so far from it. 

And yet, I love when we have sex. Somehow you’ve become more than just a means to satisfaction for me; I love being close to you, and I crave it for reasons that are deeper than just lust. One of the only times I ever feel like I’m fine and life is ok is when we’re curled up in bed, and I have my head on your chest and your arm is around me. You feel comforting, like home. And especially the last time, when you went slow and pushed me down and held my hands and kissed my neck –it was almost like you loved me back and that is going to kill me goddamnit. I don’t even like that kind of sex, but somehow it was amazing to do that with you. And you’re so damn pretty. I love your refined muscles and your narrow hips and your long blonde eyelashes. I love the shape of your lips and the way you kiss and the way your shoulder feels when I bury my face in it. I love the way you make me laugh and your stupid catchphrase humour and when you quote Killzone just to piss me off. I want to hold your hand in public and kiss you when I pick you up for a gig, even if the tuba player is sitting in the backseat. I want you to come over more often so we can just cuddle and talk and make out sometimes instead of always meeting up at parties and after parties for 2 AM booty-calls. I want to get you really really high and ask you if you love me and whatever you say, I’m going to push you down and make love to you just once instead of merely fucking because you won’t remember anything in the morning anyway, you never do after you’ve been smoking weed. 

I really need you in my life. You make me not want to kill myself, because it would disappoint you. But I can’t have you in my life the way I want and it’s torture to see you every day and kiss you on the weekends and I can’t do anything about it because the sex is my last desperate cling to the nice side of you, the side that I need to see under all your sarcasm and preppiness and popularity. I can’t tell if you actually care or not and it’s driving me up the wall. You’re part of the reason I’ve been skipping class. I really really really hate your ass [name], and I wish you would go die sometimes so I wouldn’t have to deal with my feelings about you anymore. 

If you ever find this I’m going to be so embarrassed,

That last night we spent together cuddling in bed was the happiest I've been in a really, really long time. It was nothing but feeling your arms around me and whispering and singing and smiling in between kisses and crying a little. I woke up finding your hand around the back of my neck and smiled. We stood in the shower for at least thirty minutes, letting the warm water pour over our bodies and smiling in the light streaming in through that tiny window. You make me feel amazing about myself and I can never thank you enough for that.  
   
I don't know if I'm crying because I'm going to miss you or if I'm probably never going to see you again or if I'm just so happy. Did I tell you that? I'll tell you again. You make me so happy.  I'm so happy. 
  
In some ways, I wish we had had a falling out so I could be angry at you and not be so confused about how I feel. Anger is easy. Watching someone who makes you happy walk away is much harder. 

You deserve the best, and you've shown me that I do too. And the best for us isn't each other, because we both know that the distance is too much. And that's hard. I don't know if I can love, but I know that you are the first person in a long time to make me feel so happy, and that's so difficult to walk away from. But I am so, so, thankful for what has happened.  

So, thank you. Thank you for giving me kisses and holding my hand. Thank you for cuddling with me and waking up next to me. Thank you for just listening to me. Thank you for making me so goddamn fucking happy. I've said that ten times at least, but like I told you last night, I always hate trying to find the right words to say what I mean.

It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss.    

We’ve been through so much together.  
Things that will not be easily forgotten, but I truly wish the best for the both of us.  
    
I realize now how sick things were becoming and how this ending was necessary.  
I fell so hard that I’m killing myself, yes I need help out of this grave that I’ve dug.  
    
I know you can walk away without caring too much, but you’re amazing and beautiful, we both know you will find another soul to travel with easily.  
    
You always told me I was gorgeous in my own way and for this I must thank you.  
You were without a doubt my bestfriend.  
    
When I felt numb and so hollow inside you carried me through it all, across the divide.  
You understood me in ways no one else could.  
But your final request was something I could never live with.  
And with that you said goodbye.  
    
Here’s to you, the one who taught me to forgive, my babygirl, my princess, my lovebug.

I miss last week when nothing else mattered: husbands/wives, kids, jobs, other normal life things. It felt good to just get to know you alone. We could have in depth talks without distractions. In the alternate universe we are so happy and not wearing our masks. 

Please, in this world, don't stop staring at me. Please don't leave me behind. Please don't forget about me. I need you to keep caring about me. I need you.

When I met you, I had the same fear. The same barriers, the same faked tough exterior that I'd put up. Then eventually, my barriers fell. And you are honestly the only person that I don't regret letting them fall for.


I know our time when we were together was short lived. The reasons for it ending are the best they could possibly be.


I thought I was getting over you, I really did. We spent our time together as friends still and I was just happy to be with you, even if it was no longer in the romantic sense.


But I realised that even if I am getting over you, it's going to take far longer than I thought. And all I want is for the niggling feeling in the back of my head that we are eventually going to end up together to go away.


I don't know what you feel about it. It's obvious we care about each other. It's horrible that circumstance means that we can't be together at the moment. I'm sort of hoping that when these circumstances are over, we will be together again or I'll finally be over you.

Going back to my main point in writing this is was as an apology. I apologize for the way I treated you when I broke it off, I was unfair to you after you tried more than I ever did to make our relationship work. I apologize for whatever psychological effects I certainly must have caused you. Mostly I'm sorry I broke up with you, I don't know what you saw in me, but I was an inconsiderate asshole and certainly not a good boyfriend.

Only when you nearly lost Marissa to an abusive man, did you want to be best friends. You know what's sad? I have no memory of you ever wanting to hug me as a little girl. None. I would want to lay my head on you in church and you would push me away and tell me to get off because it was too hot. I don't even remember you trying to have a special bond with us. Why the fuck do you think Marissa and I have the relationship we do with dad? He taught us everything. He taught us how to tie our shoes. How to ride our bikes. How to fly kites. You showed your love by taking us places. Spending money on us. And now you hate us for our relationship with him? Fuck you. You were a shitty parent. And to this day, you refuse to get any help. You act like a teenager over everything. You are so fucking immature. Seriously. I have no idea how that man stays with you. You treat him like absolute shit. You're a spiteful bitch.

I miss holding your hand. 

I miss going to the movies with you and us wanting to watch every movie we saw the trailer for. 

I miss how you never thought twice about spending money on me. 

I miss going to the taco shop for lunch. 

I miss when you'd surprise me at school, you never did that after my junior year. 

I miss how tan you get in the summer. 

I miss your work clothes. 

I miss you never knowing what you wanted to do with your life besides marry me.  

I miss you helping me do my chores. 

I miss going out of town with you.

You are what helps me sleep at night and you are what helps me get up in the morning. I love you more than anything else in the world, and I can't imagine life without you. Every single thing about you is, to me, perfect. You have beautiful eyes, perfect lips, a delighful face, wonderful hair, the cutest nose, the ideal build and figure, the most wondrous and enchanting personality I know, the greatest hobbies and interests, fantastic taste in music, you're strong and independent and can stand up for yourself, you're funny and fun-loving, you can be serious when need be, and whenever I see you or I am with you time slows down for me. And I don't mean that in the cliched way, I mean that down-to-earth seriously. Every moment I spent with you is treasured, and even though our relationship didn't work out those four days I had you, and especially the Saturday night, were literally the happiest days of my life. I felt like I was high, a constant love-induced euphoria. I felt like I was floating everywhere I went. I was giddy, excited, and I even had trouble getting to sleep because I was just so overjoyed whenever I thought to myself ""She's mine"". I know that those days are gone and that more likely than not they will never come back, but those memories are the ones I treasure most in my life. I care more about you than I do anyone or anything else. I would do anything for you if it would bring that gorgeous, adorable smile onto your face. When I hear you laugh, it is the most beautiful sound I have ever heard. You always cheer me up, even when you're in a bad mood or irritated at me for some reason, because you are perfect. You are literally the girl of my dreams. And of recent times, I've been trying to deny myself that. I've been saying to myself ""Jack, you don't really love her; you just think you do"" in a futile effort to convince myself that I can move on and enjoy my life knowing that you don't feel the same way about me and never will. It doesn't work. I constantly cry or break down inside knowing that you aren't interested in me, that you've reduced me back to being a friend and you see me as that, nothing more. The worst part of it is that if you ever found this or knew how I felt about you, you would be scared of me. You would think I'm creepy, obsessed, weird. You wouldn't realise that I genuinely feel this for you, and that I genuinely love you. Part of me wants you to read this because I want you to know, truly, how I feel about you. But the other part of me knows that if you DID read this, things would never be the same again.

Making small talk was just something to kill the time on that winter day while the metallic clink of bbs shot echoed through the house. I thought you were pretty, but taken by another man. I thought it was unnerving when you sat so close to me but I didn’t let it show. I didn’t love you when I saw you next at Fernando’s house, downing shot after shot of Honey jack. I was amused by the spectacle and having fun with friends and you, while thinking nothing of the matter. Departure from the house with you in the passenger seat I felt nervous. I wasn’t sure what was going on other than the fact that you were unhappy with Johnny. I should have run. I should have run when you cozied up to me in the driver’s seat of my truck. I should have run when we kissed. But I did not. I didn’t love you when we took a drive up power line road, each with a different goal in mind. I should have run, but I didn’t. I didn’t love you when you came with me and met my parents. I didn’t love you when you drove down over winter break to my house to see me; I was the fool for not seeing your sacrifices just to visit me. I should have paid more attention, but I did not. I didn’t love you when we were finally free to show our relationship. I didn’t love you when we were always hanging out together, but I was intrigued. I was intrigued by your wild side, that side of me was never riled up until I hung out with you. I was intrigued by you. I didn’t love you when you went arm deep in a junked land cruiser to pull off parts, but I was intrigued. I should have seen it then, but I didn’t. I didn’t love you when I spent a weekend in Ukiah getting bucked off a horse and meeting your family. I tried not to love you with every moment I ruined with us, I know now I was a fool for that. I hated you for telling me about chad, you broke me with those words; I felt shattered to pieces. I didn’t love you when you decided to tow my broken down truck to Stockton to visit Georg. I barely felt intrigued, but something kept me talking to you. I didn’t love you with every stop in the canyon to check on the hastily made tow bar and brake wiring. I didn’t love you when we both got out at the rest stop halfway down the canyon and you hugged me. I didn’t love you when we held each other close, hearts beating faster while I looked into your eyes; until we kissed, and I did love you. I tried not to love you with each passing day and your departure coming closer. I tried not to love you with each whispering of “I love you” in the dark, while holding each other close. Then you left. And I put up a façade for those around to hide the loneliness. I didn’t love you any longer in day to day life, I just buried myself in work and fishing, leaving no time to think, love or be a person. I didn’t love you when you called while I got drunk to drown the sadness and called it quits, and then I did love you again. I loved you with each day after, once again putting up a wall to hide the hurt of losing you to Zack and Chelsea, with Fernando just knowing enough. I loved you when Tyler made an underhanded comment about you while visiting the house, while he narrowly avoiding getting yelled at by my tongue. Slowly I had pushed away the feelings with each passing day of not hearing from you. Then I looked on Facebook to see a change a in your relationship status while with Fernando and some of his friends. I thought I was done, but reading those words struck me like a wall of bricks. I nearly broke down in the living room amidst everyone. Off I went to the truck, tearing up a dirt road in order to dull everything and stop thinking. I was done, I was angry, I was frustrated. I didn’t love you any longer, and I got frustrated and I took it out on you like a child, when in reality it’s my own fault for being so wrapped up around you without the reciprocity. I don’t want you to know I am weak, and feel lost in a fog, but I am. I didn’t love you, and wasn’t intrigued, when I drove 45 miles down the canyon to the rest stop just to feel what we had again at 4 in the morning. I don’t love you anymore. But that’s the lie I keep telling myself to get me though another night and day alone. But for now, I need to keep my mind on the drive home in the dark, I didn’t cry when you left Quincy, but I can’t help it sitting here in my truck in the middle of the canyon by myself in the dark.

I still remember my childhood.  Despite the fact that I ended up living with you, despite the fact that you seem almost stable now, I can't forget.  Even though I never got the same extent of physical abuse that my brothers did, the constant screaming, insults, and fights scarred me. Your abuse to my animals, the fact that they would have ""ran away"" after you would threaten to get rid of them.  The fact that you were so *nice* to everyone except your family.  The fact that you got rid of my dog I loved and still have the nerve to tell me that it wasn't your fault.   I can't forget or forgive.  What disgusts me the most isn't even that you can talk to me and come visit me in college like you never did any of the terrible things you did.   No, what **really** disgusts me is that I can. That I can sit there and talk to you without confronting you sickens me.  Years of being told I'm not good enough is still echoing in my ears.   Yet even after all you've done, I'm just as bad as you.   Pretending nothing happened, pretending I had some semblance of a normal childhood.

I can never forgive you for making me hate myself.



Dear ""mom""

I wish the huge scar you gave me wasn't in a visible place because I hate lying to my friends when they ask me.  I hate you for making me think that things could be normal for me.  You left him because of what he did to us, and then you became him.  You became worse than him.  You acted dependent on me, shamelessly using emotional blackmail for whatever you wanted.  Whenever I didn't agree with you, whenever I got fed up, you said I was just like him, just like my father.  I hate that you would make me question whether I was in the wrong, if I was the one with the problem.  I was your daughter, I shouldn't have had to support you.   I didn't get a job so that I could pay the rent or pay all of the bills while you gambled and drank it away.  You spent more time obsessing over a man who you went on one date with than you would bother to consider me. 

It's been over a year since I made the decision to not speak to you and I *despise* you for forcing me to break that promise to myself.  You had no right to come into where I work and cause problems.  You have no right to withhold my belongings.   

I am not him, and I am not you.  I live my life **based** around the sole purpose of not becoming what my genetic destiny calls for.

You've been gone a little over a week now. You're only out of the country briefly, but it's been enough time for me to miss lying in your arms. Talking via Skype isn't really the same. I can't smack you when you make a horrid joke or kiss you when you make a particularly brilliant comment (both of which you do quite often). Hearing my name drip from your honeyed lips simply isn't the same when the words come in through my headphones. 

Even when you are halfway across the planet, my mind wanders to the times that you've been in my arms. I would have apologized for the bruises I gave you, but you insisted that I not.

I wouldn't call it a bad thing, but that is yet to be discovered. You innocence and naivety versus a certain kind of corruption means that this will only go one of two ways. I find myself at a standstill -- will the we go down in flames, or light the world on fire?

I wonder if you thought of me at all, walking past my apartment building.  Do you know I still live there?  Wonder if you saw me.  God, I hope not.  I pray you didn't think of the last time we saw each other.  I was such a broken mess of a person; an embarrassment to myself.

Maybe that's why I feel such remorse and sadness in regards to our.. whatever you would call it.  I've gotten so much better.  And while I'd like to think that you have an inkling about it, I honestly don't think that you consider me and my life much, if at all.  Save for all my missteps with you.

So this is weird. I’m not really sure of anything today. I just wanted to put in words just how I find you completely fascinating and magnetic. 

Last night we had a sleepover at your place, and shared your bed. We  cuddled, tangled limbs, breathing softly. I woke up this morning sure of nothing. 

When I first met you, you said how much you wished I was gay. Well... I’m not. With this one exception: you. 

One Sunday, I came over to hang out with you after a weekend of NO sleep. That night, you asked me to stay, and I fumbled for reasons not to, just because I needed to figure out where I wanted our boundaries to be. Since then we have spent so much time together, but I always feel like it isn’t enough. We watch movies, we ride bikes, we have picnics, all the while having a delicately intuitive dance around each other when sharing spaces. 

 Early this morning, as the sun was rising, I figured out that I don’t want the platonic boundaries of friendship between you and me. I love waking up next to you. I love sleeping next to you. I love talking to you, I love how easy it is to hang out with you, but how you challenge me without being an asshole about it. 

This morning, half asleep, I turned over and put my hand on your stomach - I laid my fingers on your belly button ring.. I’m not sure what circuit blew in my brain at that time, but I was suddenly ridiculously turned on. My god. I went home with wet panties. 

Girl I Know, I’m going away this weekend. It’s a long weekend. I’ve been excited about it for ages, but I know you’re not coming.. and Girl I Know, that makes the weekend seem like forever.

I admire your willpower. I know nobody else who could stop smoking overnight. Naturally, the fact that you were informed that it would interfere with your HRT must have inspired you.

You're a pirate, a lolicon, a self-absorbed brat, manipulative, spiteful, and willing to drive former friends to shambles if they get in your way.

Even my obsessions are ephemeral. You aren't fascinating enough to string me along constantly without pause. When we are but friends, you enjoy that as well, but you'll string me along when you get a chance. You tell me it's not intentional, but when you drink, you admit you enjoy it.

The mind games are fun and desirable, but I'd like a chance at you as an equal. I'm arrogant as fuck, so it surprised me to think of anyone that way.

I'm not always a good person. Sometimes I am. You're not always a good person. Sometimes you are. We're usually both good sorts though.

I'd like you to fall in love with me so I could fall in love with you. I'd like him to fall in love with you so I can fall out of love with you. I'd just like to fuck for a while, admit this is going nowhere fast, and enjoy not sharing our burdens outside the bedroom, one of us being gone before the other woke. I'd like to hold you tight, help you through tight spots, take your hand when I stumble, and wake up knowing you would be there. I'd like absolutely nothing to change and this cycle of limerence to last until one of us broke. I'd like everything to change and everyone to find their happily ever after.

I wish I had never met you and I am so very grateful that I did.

It's a shame I can't find anyone half as interesting as you. It would be more fair if I could and walked away, knowing we'd still be friends through it all. It would be more fair if you could walk away, but you've never tried to drive me off, no matter what line I crossed.

The fact that you constantly whine about being poor/broke is what bothers me the most. You choose to spend money on expensive things you don't need. Your parents pay almost everything for you and you still don't have money most of the time. One of my biggest regrets has to be the fact that I borrowed money from you. I have no idea why I did.

I am not willing to believe that I will never see you again. That I will never hear you again. No more ""and a Dr. Pepper for Kiddo"". No more having you scare off then men who hit on me at bars, by pretending you are my dad. You didn't just pretend you were my dad, you acted as one. You became like a father to me when I moved away from home. You became everything I needed when I moved to the place where I knew no one. 

I still remember the first time I met you. I had just moved to town, and you were sitting outside of the coffee shop. I sat down at a table by myself and you and the woman who became my best friend invited me over to sit, talk, and smoke with you. I will never forget how kind you were. How you took me under your wing and introduced me to everyone I know down there.

I will never forget that even after I turned 21, you would still order beers for everyone, and tease me by ordering a Dr. Pepper for me still. I will never forget how you were there to comfort me with my first heart break. At the same time I will never forget the last words I said to you.

Writing used to make me feel better: an escape from what is real. Put it into words. Make it beautiful. A fairy tale. I can't seem to do it anymore. The words, the sentences, the phrases don't seem right. 
It doesn't make sense.Things I want to write seem so rash and selfish. But is it okay to be that way? 



 
They say the more you experience in life, the more beautiful your painting becomes.

Life is like a canvas.
 

For me, solitude has always been a friend of mine. I chose to live life this way because I feared of going through the tough times, heartbreak, and pain. I closed my doors, locked the windows, and shut the drapes. Sunlight unable to peek through.
 

I was safe. 

I was comfortable. 

But my canvas remained blank in my lonely house...

 
It's been some time since I've open my doors, but sometimes I still wonder if it's a mistake that I made. I know I can't turn back time. Marks have been made on the canvas already. But I can't see the beauty in this piece. More often than not, I fear that it was a decision that shouldn't have been made. Lately, I've been thinking of that more and more...
 

They say that you can't enjoy life if you don't experience happiness and suffer through the hurt. 

They say that if a wound is made, time will heal it. 

They say that you're not alone. 

 
But I feel alone. All the words in this world expressed doesn't help me feel less by myself.

Did I make the right decision?

Will I regret this?

I fear for what's to come...

Will there be a hole in the center of my piece? How long will it take me to repair that? With all the paint I slather on top.. will it make it go away? Or will the memories be here to stay forever? Is this madness?

Or am I just mad?
 

It's hard to make this ambiguous when my thoughts are only going down one path. Perhaps this is why it makes no sense. I'm unable to understand the circumstance anymore. 
 

I might not say it well and

I might end up taking too long,

but I want you to hear it.

So, listen, okay? 

I always thought that it was just a dream, to be happy and careless,

I never thought it could actually happen

What to do?

I'm probably not saying it well, but I want to explain properly, but I can't get it out clearly.

Are you listening? 

Do you care?

Even if I can't say it well...

The important thing is the feeling I want to tell.

These are words,

words that weren't carefully chosen.

but words that express these emotions.

It's not a beautiful confession.

It's not beautiful at all.

But that doesn't matter.

Just the one.

What I want us to be:

I want to become the most important person to you,

to call you without reason, 

to text you,

to share a cake and giving uneven amount of portions, where I eat most of it,

but you just laugh and forgive me.

To hold hands without needing to say a single word?

Like it's the most natural thing in the world to do.

You showed up at MY graduation party. I didn't know who you were. Your rotten little bastard children ran around destroying everything. You gathered in a group, and gave me dirty looks whenever I passed by. My own party. My celebration. That my family worked hard to put together for ME. You were rude to me and my family, and were only allowed around because we felt bad for you and my mother was too nice to tell you that you weren't welcome there. 

Then you come to my aunt's birthday party, and this is where I get mad. I have tourettes. You tell your kids it's okay to antagonize me? It's not okay to bark back at me, and get in my face, and purposely upset me, just to see how hard I can tic. Especially when I am forced to sit in the 90+degree heat because it's ""rude to sit in your a/c when we have guests..."" 

I suffered that day. My OCD raged. I had anxiety so bad that I ended up locking myself in my room and retching because your monster children upset me so bad. Tourettes, or any disorder, disability, etc. IS NOT FUNNY! And not a thing to pick on!

I will get past that. Your children are bastards. Whatever. I hate kids as it is. 

But then we get to the food. There were about ~40 people at this picnic. My mother made about 60 hamburgers, 40 hotdogs, and 30 chicken legs. Plus about 5 lbs of three different kinds of salads, 10 bags of chips, about 4 lbs worth of chicken kebobs, baked beans, etc.

We made enough food to feed twice the amount of people that were there. I barely got to eat. The birthday girl didn't get to eat at all.

*Why?* 

Because we saw what you did. You took the food off the table (seriously, who takes 20 hamburgers?) and started carting it to your car. You stole at least half the hamburger patties, around 15 hot dogs, (not counting the ones you took when my mom desperately made more trying to feed everyone) at least two bags of chips, half the chicken, and half the drinks. 

We saw you and your dirty little sausage monster children packing the food in your car before anybody even got a plate. We saw you taking stuff out of our fridge and packing it in your car. We saw your kids going to the car when they wanted a drink. We even caught your little cunt of a daughter sneaking into our kitchen, when she had to ""go to the bathroom"" trying to see if she could find more to pack into your car. 

You are disgusting. I later found out you did this at my grad party. Stole food, refused to socialize, then left. Then you took half the home-made birthday cake I worked my ass off on for my aunt. And took it home. No. You couldn't wait until everyone got a serving. You stole from us.

You are filthy wastes of skin. Don't you ever come back or near my fucking family again. I had to go into my room and calm down because I was ticcing, ""NIGGGGGERRRSS!"" because I was so mad. I'm not inherently racist, but you and your family are what I hate about people. You are now officially barred from coming to our social gatherings. 

You will **not** be coming anywhere near my wedding. 

And for the record: They aren't starving. They have food stamps, get assistance from the church, AND get food from their grandmother (my grandmother's friend.) I know you're not suffering.

Each night I thought about something different. One night it’s an apartment in the city, the next it’s a house in the suburbs, then it’s a condo overlooking the city. Each time I thought about how many cats we’d have, or I’d think about different species of dogs.

I’m so overwhelmed with emotions, I can’t handle it sometimes.

I would sit at my desk and… daydream of you as the mother of my children. The thought has never crossed my mind before; I’ve never assigned that role to someone in my life. I had never been with someone that I saw a future with. You’ve affected every single part of me. The things I thought I knew, the things I thought I wanted, you’ve changed them all. It’s not that things have changed, it was more I didn’t know what I wanted. Well, I knew what I wanted – a wife, kids, a house, happily ever after. But that was just a child’s story, a picture with a sentence at the bottom. There was no plan, no way for me to know how to get there.

I don’t like not having a plan. I don’ t like not knowing what to do next.

I kept trying to put my emotions into a little box like I always do. Looking and analyzing all the end results and consequences. And when I thought of you and a future together, I couldn’t think of anything bad. I’d always been able to look at a good situation and find something wrong… something that can’t be fixed or couldn’t allow me to continue on. But I look at you, at us and I found nothing.

This is something that I think I need to say, even though you'll never read it. But I keep tossing and turning tonight, and I know I'll never get some sleep unless I get this out.

Before I went to bed you tried texting me again. Nothing too big. You just wanted to know what I'd been up to. But that meant the world to me, which is why I couldn't respond.

I love you. I never thought I would be able to again, but then I met you. You had someone else, but at the time I didn't care. I just wanted to be near you. It changed when you said you were getting married, because I realized then that if I didn't take steps, then I would be stuck in something very unhealthy and poisonous, and you deserve so much better than that. To protect the both of us, I cut off contact with you after you got married.

It's been months now and I am still in love with you. It kills me anytime you try to contact me that I can't respond. Last night, when you tried to contact me again, I was tempted. I was so tempted. And I was thrilled, because it meant that you wanted to see how I was doing. You thought about me. 

But then I remembered that I do this with virtually every text you send me, even when it has nothing to do with my well-being. And the simple truth is that anything you do and anything you say will always mean more to me than it does to you. I would give almost anything to change that, but I can't turn back time and it's too late now.

I love you D. I miss you. I think about you every hour of every day and I dream about you at night. I don't know how you feel about the fact that I never respond- and you try to contact me much more than I thought you would, which makes me think that perhaps the signs that you felt something for me too weren't all in my head- but if I could, I would tell you that every time you try I wrestle with myself and my decision, and the only reason I have stayed as strong as I have is because I know I'm doing the right thing, for both of us. And if I hurt you by this, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. 

I love you. I miss you.

And just so you know, I haven't been up to much. Too busy studying.

Despite your dumb obsession with bacon and my rabbits, I think you are incredible. You’re the one person I don’t get sick of talking to and never fail to laugh at. I know all seems super uncalled for but it really hasn’t always been like this, I’ve only ever seen you as a friend, until you broke up with Adam. I got super drunk one night and realized that I was into you, at first I refused to believe that because we’ve always been just friends but the more we hung out the more I fell in love with your personality and realized it was kind of true. I haven’t said anything because I really do not want to ruin our friendship over something so spontaneous and unfair to you and I know how much you hate soppy shit like this. 

I’m not asking you for anything in return I just want you to know that you are the coolest girl I know and also pretty damn cute, and if you ever want to give me a chance I would love to give a shot at making you happy like you deserve. We are two very different people but maybe that’s a good thing, maybe we can teach each other a thing or two, you’re independent I get that but you’ve never had a boyfriend that actually treats you like a girl should be treated and I’ve never had a girlfriend that gave me a real chance.

I know I can never see you both again, but I hold your story so close to my heart and sometimes I retell it to myself so that I can remember that there is unspoken bravery in the world. 

I don't know if you are still homeless but I want you to know that when I think of you, I think of you with a home. I see you in school. I see you both getting the degrees you were denied in your home country. I see you earning your right to asylum here in the US. I see you learning how to smile again, finding someone to love, seeing your family again. 

I know it's hard. I know you doubt yourselves. 

I know that sometimes, Jon, you hate your brother because it was *HE* who started this. If only he hadn't protested, if only he had just (you can say it, I know you think it) died in prison and then none of this would have happened. It is OK to be angry. You have every right to be angry at what has happened to you. But also know that your brother loves you so dearly, and would do anything for you. 

And M, I think about your sweet smile when you ran into the doorway, and the way you lean in with your left ear, because the right one doesn't work since they beat you. 

But you're heroes, boys, and I know it and I hope you know it too. You are so brave and strong and I will never forget you. Hold onto each other, and if you have a minute please think of me, because I am rooting for you so hard and I am always, always cheering you on from a distance.

You might be wondering why I decided to type you a letter. I am too actually... I just feel like I have a lot to say, I know that I do, but I don’t have a clue how to say it. I guess it makes the most sense to start from the beginning, which for this purpose is just 8 months ago, in January. You don’t know much about my life before this time, or what I was like, but I was a genuinely different person. Although it is sad to say, I wasn't very happy. 
I’ve always felt a little overwhelmed by life. Living in the same place for too long, and doing the same things too many times had caused me to question my life’s significance, and I felt like something was missing. I made the plan to transfer to SSU last summer, and since then I have been waiting. I convinced myself that if I waited patiently, I would eventually move away and find everything I was looking for. It was a forged dream, but it was the best thing I had. 
It was in this transitory phase of my life that I met you, and you changed everything. I don’t remember when it happened, but somewhere along the line, working with you and hearing your story, I became enamored, purely infatuated. I think you know this, even though I’ve never come out and said it, which might be, by the way, my biggest regret. 
 I’ve spent what feels like every hour for the last few months trying to understand you, and this relationship we have. You are one of the strongest people I have ever met, but it is more than that. Your strength doesn’t seem to come from sheer willpower, certainly not from ignorance, or some illusion of a better future. There is a happiness in you that is so natural and beautiful, it draws every person in an embraces them. You have a tremendous gift for hope; and, it has struck me that despite everyone around me racing, like paper boats made by children, sailing towards some meaningless end, this gift you have is perfection. You are worthy of every second of life.
I believe that everybody needs someone to love and something to hope for. You have given me both, and I will never forget that. 


Sincerely,
D

I wish you had killed yourself long ago. I wish you died. I wish you never were my mother to begin with. I almost wish that I had never been born but that’s starting to come around because I see that I didn’t deserve to be beaten and abused. The screaming, the yelling. I didn’t deserve that. I see that now. 

Before some recent psychological breakthroughs, you had me thinking I was worthless, had me questioning why the gift of consciousness was ever given to me. Truth is, you were just fucking insane. Something should’ve killed you, stopped you. If there were a God you’d have been killed long ago by a billionaire drunk driver and our dads would all have full custody. You needed to be dead so that we wouldn’t be raised with still-born minds. Your living-death style of parenthood propagates itself. You are the corruption to be solved. The cancer that spreads throughout generations because you warp your progeny’s minds from birth. We were your house servants to be beaten if we disobeyed. It was never in my mind to kill you myself because you kept such a strong fear-based hold over my mind that I couldn’t think to disobey you, for to do so is to invite immediate suffering upon myself—your fists, and your horrifying rants declaring total ownership over us. Your fleeting, short pecks of affection only occurred when I gave you silent, unquestioning obedience. You disgust me. 

If you’re not going to die soon from organ failure due to your fluctuating cocktail of pharmaceuticals, and if you’re not going to kill yourself, you need to make sure you’re a good enough mother to the last of them to outweigh the landfills of shit you buried the first of us in. Your kids deserve a better mother than you. You were a piece of shit, you are a piece of shit, and now you need to clean the fuck up or just kill yourself already. You made us create elaborate psychological coping mechanisms just to deal with you!  

**JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. YOU FORCED THE SCARED, ENDANGERED MINDS OF LITTLE CHILDREN TO THE POINT THAT AT LEAST ONE OF THEM HAD TO CREATE AN ALTERNATE SUPER-HERO PERSONALITY THAT FEELS NO EMOTIONAL PAIN SO HE COULD GET THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT KILLING HIMSELF—AWESOME WORK!** 

Perhaps you understand now why I don’t care when you say “I did my best,” but I wouldn’t dare put a limit on your capability to disappoint me. 

But maybe you’re just another iteration of the corruption, and generations of corruption before you had your script written before you were born, too. I guess I can accept that. Maybe that’s the path to forgiveness, to realize that you were just a scared child too, trying to impress your masters with such well-behaved children. It didn’t matter that we were well-behaved out of fear of pain and abandonment, did it? Maybe you were just a warped child raising children in a warped way to please your warped masters. I fucking hope so, because to think that you’re just a naïve child raising children in a “fire-from-the-hip” type knee-jerk emotional way-- that would fucking enrage me. 
	
I’m trying to write you a dignified epitaph here, “Mom”. So toss me a bone and tell me your father raped you because you weren’t pretty enough, and he’d only stop raping you if you lost weight or made your skin look healthy. Give me a story that helps me make sense of you and how you abused THE ENTIRE FUCKING FLEET OF KIDS THAT CAME OUT OF YOUR CLOWN-CAR VAGINA. 
	
I don’t want to think that you were just a crazy bitch. I want to think there’s a deeper story to why you were so god-damned mean to us. To be able to look a young child in the face, a child you helped create, and in the same day flip from “I love you, honey, and I’d do absolutely anything for you, even my last breath to make you happy” to “GET OUT OF MY SIGHT YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT!”-- that’s a special kind of fucked up. 	
	
Be careful with that “last breath” line, because I’m going to call it in if you don’t SHOW ME, WITH YOUR FUCKING ACTIONS, THAT YOU’LL BE A BETTER MOTHER TO YOUR KIDS, I will hold a mirror to you and reveal the nightmare you were to us, your children. It will horrify you, it will burn your eyes, and you will wish for death, and I won’t stop you. There is no salvation in words, only actions. Your words will continue to mean nothing to me, because aside from all the broken promises, you can take a phrase like, “I love you” and turn it into, “I own you. Now smile and tell me you love me or else I’ll beat the shit out of you until you scream it for me.” What kind of psychotic mind-rapist shit is that?  
	
You’re an inspiration, do you know that? You’re a beautiful villain because you’re not even aware of how awful you are. But it’s there. And if you don’t straighten out I will remind you of what you truly are, every day, until you cut yourself out of the fabric of living creatures here on earth, and leave the rest of us to heal, because even if I spent every day of the rest of my life drunk, high, and sedentary, I’d still be too good for you. You don’t deserve to celebrate my life and career successes as “your son”, because I worked my ass off to spite you. That’s at the center of my beating heart: proving you wrong for calling me worthless. 

Fuck you very much,

That's my attempt at writing a short poem. Who am I kidding though.. I will never stop loving you or caring about you. You are the most beautiful girl I've ever had the fortune of meeting. And you've been through horrible pain. You've been deeply hurt.. you don't know who you can trust. You can trust me. You said you did once.. Sometimes you let those walls down, but then the next day they go right back up. I understand those walls and I understand the loneliness. I wish you wouldn't push me away. Every part of me is telling me not to give up on you. I'm just not sure how to reach out. You deserve the world and the happiness you haven't been able to have. There is so much beauty out there you have yet to see. Don't go back to what is comfortable.. what is ""normal"" It is okay to be afraid. The greatest things, they don't come easy. It is scary and it's hard.. but I promise you well worth it. 
I wish there was a way that you could feel what I'm feeling right now. That you could experience how I experience you. The way you see yourself and the way you talk about yourself. If you could just see the beautiful person that's there.. that you are. You have an amazing heart full of so much compassion. You have so much to offer and YOU ARE WORTH IT. Don't ever say you aren't. You can get mad. You can say whatever you want. You can try and make me hate you. But the fact of the matter is that I am not giving up on you.. the heart wants what it wants. My heart wants you. I can't stop loving you and I'm not sorry. I'm stubborn and I'm all in for you. Until you tell me that you don't want me. That you don't love me. Until you can say those words to my face.

Today is that day you loved so much, the first day you can feel summer coming. Sunny, and warm (despite there still being some snow), and everybody is in a good mood. 

Me, not so much. I'm thinking of you. Like I always do - but today it's stronger, because it was on a day like this that I met you. When I saw you sitting on the roof of the school, with sleeves and pants rolled up as far as possible, I had the instinctive feeling that you were something special. I don't mean that in a cliche-love-at-first-sight way - in fact, it was more of the opposite. Short hair, no make-up, shabby clothes, you were absolutely not my type. That's how I knew you were special, because despite all that I still felt I had to get to know you. 

I did, and I am so, so glad I did. I feel a bit guilty for thinking you weren't my type the first time I saw you, as it didn't take me too long to realize you were the most beautiful girl I'd ever meet. So beautiful, in soul and appearance, that you did not fit into this world. There was really not a bad bone in your body; If you saw someone that you could help in any way - you did, easy as that. You didn't even think twice. Didn't matter who, didn't matter what, where or what you were doing. You simply wanted everybody to be happy, and you were willing to share whatever you had to offer with whoever needed it. Your laugh was the purest, happiest I've ever witnessed - it reminded much of a child. You reminded much of a child in general. So innocent and pure, still open to the wonders of the world. 

You were also selfless. Caring. Fearless. Calm. You were the one everyone went to for advice. You were the one taking burdens off of our shoulders, one by one. You were the first to offer your help, and if someone declined you helped them without them ever knowing. You were good at that. And what you did best of all - you made us feel safe. Like no matter what happened, everything was going to be okay. You could just sit there, look up at me and listen, and the world would feel like a better place right away. 

But sometimes, when you were the one speaking, there was this... I'm not even sure how to describe it. Like a deep, dark sound resonating in the background. A sadness of no other. We all noticed it, we all knew that, despite your childlike personality, you were carrying the pain of an old soul. 

And there you were - picking up our burdens, solving our problems, holding our hands to walk us through our difficult times. I know that's what got you in the end. You started to wither away, and everyone could see it. Everybody could see it and no one did anything. It hurts so bad to think of the fact that had we just done something, you might still be with us. Everybody saw your clothes hang more loosely, everybody saw the rings underneath your eyes. Everybody must have noticed your bones protruding, and everybody knew you weren't eating solid foods any more. I'm still trying to comprehend the fact that you were dying right in front of us, and nobody even brought it up. 

I'm sorry I never told you how beautiful you were. It was so obvious, I didn't think it needed mentioning. Not once did I even think that you didn't see yourself that way. I'm sorry that you saved so many people, and so many situations, and not a single person returned the favour. I'm sorry nobody even thanked you, I'm sorry I didn't save you from your misery, and I'm sorry you died alone and scared. 

Two months, and I never shed a tear. You never cried, never showed any weakness. You put on that wonderful smile of yours, so that nobody would know how bad things were, because you always had to make us feel safe. Well, today I'm crying. I'm crying for my friend, my first true love, my guardian angel and my saviour. I'm crying, because life's not fair; I'm crying because the only one of us who always did good had to be the one who got struck down.

I wish someone could tell me everything is going to be fine. I wish someone could make me believe that everything is going to be all right.

But you're not here anymore.

I'm ecstatic because I have so much affection for you, but I'm terrified that you'll linger on my mind and invade my thoughts like the times before.   

What do you think about at night, perched in your office high above the rest of us? Are you lonely when you sip your tea, cup after cup of the foul stuff from your equally foul and ancient teacup? Do you still smoke too much, taking long deep drags from your foreign cigarettes?  Do you still drop the butts unceremoniously on the ground, oblivious to the looks of disdain from others?

What lies inside your heart? Only theorems and formulae, axioms and lemmas? Do you think about your friends in distant places? Lovers - past, present?  High above us in your cramped, cluttered office that smells so distinctly of you. The familiar smell that I looked forward to every day for so long. 

In a way I wished that we had met earlier. Before I met and married a wonderful man. Before I learned the restraint of being an adult woman who is far too level-headed to make things awkward between us. But then I'd be too young for you, and any attention from you would have been poison in my eyes. It's an impossible situation, a losing proposition either way. 

So instead I'll savor the moments that we'll have together, listening attentively to your words, heavy with the accent of your mother tongue, hypnotized by your deft fingers as they flit across the board, numbers and letters swirling in dusty white, your broad shoulders flexing to reach the far corners of your canvas.  And then you'll turn around and then I'll be lost in those incredible grey eyes that haunt me, because they are the only part of you that I allow myself to have, and they are the only part of you that you will give to me.

And I did.  All because you kissed my forehead in my kitchen back when we called ourselves friends. All because in those years as friends you were a better partner to me than the one I shared my life and love with ever was. So I checked my baggage and flew thousands of miles to spend a week in your world. And now, it's like you've run out of reasons to reach out to me across the distance.

I'm still here. I'm here, without everything I want from you. 

But at least I have the photographs.


I look at these, and I am floored. I have never seen myself so beautiful. So happy. How could you see me that way in those moments, think to photograph me that way in those moments, and **not feel anything**? Fuck, even I fall in love with me through those photographs.  They are so raw. So revealing. So honest. [Are you?]   

And yet I fucking hate those photographs. In the rare moment I knew you had your camera trained on me, and I looked at you through the lens, or the more common moments when you simply knew how to hold it to catch how I was looking at you, how I felt for you is written on every inch and breath of me. Even ever without words, the story is there.  I couldn't deny it if I wanted to. It's probably why when you called me drunk after the bar, one of the few times I've heard from you since I got back, you declared that I was"" madly in love"" with you. You have the proof in front of you in high res.  

I never saw you look at me that way.  

Well, maybe once or twice. In those pre-dawn hours when I woke up beside you, before you, still on my time. And you must have felt me stir. And you found me with your eyes and your arms. In that moment I thought I read in your softened smile how much it meant to have me [there with you]. How much you didn't want me to go.

Then I cry.  I feel like dying when I think about you with another girl.  I want to think that she doesn't deserve you, or that your interest will fade quickly, but I know that won't happen.  Your relationship with me was unexpected and probably just practice for you.  It wasn't my first time to be serious about another person, but it was yours.  Deep down I know that you never truly expected it to last, and you were waiting for the right moment to end it.  Foolish me, it caught me by surprise.  Someone asked me why I care about you so deeply, and what made me love you.  There is no reason, not really.  Maybe it's because, compared with my previous boyfriend, you are an angel.  The perfunctory courtesy you treated me with was in juxtaposition to the stark indifference and cruelty of the last guy.  Only because I want to, I believe that you will come back to me.  Only because I want to, I believe that you still love me.  Only because I want to, I believe that you want me to be jealous.  But I know that I was a convenience for you.  I was free food and a warm bed and wet sticky sex.  You were arms to me; arms that held me and then arms that let go and were held behind your back in regret.  I was vulnerable when I met you, so it stands to reason that I continue to be a nutcase after you have left my life.  I know that I didn't treat you well enough when we were together.  I tried to afterward.  I want to make you feel special and loved and safe.  I want to return the favor but I guess you don't need it.  Even if you hadn't found someone new, you would be fine.

I can't get you off my mind tonight.  I only broke up with you a few hours ago, but you we're so distraught when we hung up Skype.  I have never experienced so much pain, but what choice did you leave me? I understand that people make mistakes, but you made too many.  I was your ""boyfriend on the side"" for six months.  I understand that was a year ago, and I understand that you've changed, but four second chances is too much.  There's just too much writing on the wall to go back to a clean slate, regardless of how long it's been.  I needed to end it, and I'm sorry.

I keep telling myself that.  I needed to do it, but did I really?  Maybe you were right, you know I have nothing but love for you in my heart, maybe we could have made something out of nothing.  I still think it was the right thing to do, you were miserable in Massachusetts, and I was too, here in California.  But as much as I try to reassure myself the I did the right thing, that feeling is falling away and soon all that will be left is that sick pit of terror that I've made the biggest mistake I could possibly make; I've let you go and you will never come back, that I will one day see you, and you'll be married, you'll have children as beautiful as you are and you'll be happy... with someone else.  With someone else that is living the life that I so desperately want to lead.  Maybe it was the wrong time and place to meet; it's tough for high school sweethearts to last, especially going to college 3000 miles away.  Maybe in another life, you can be my soul mate, maybe once again be my one true love.

Maybe it was unlucky to have you as my my first love, because there can never be someone else as perfect as you.  Sitting here, there's nothing else I can think of but amazing memories.  Your long brown hair, so dark people thought it was black, how soft and straight it was; I remember that laugh you hate so much that I'll never hear again and your cute button nose.  So beautiful, but you can never see it yourself.  I miss the way you would beam after I gave you a compliment.

You're everywhere I look.  Valentines day is on the tv.  When I went shopping, I saw those cheesy disposable cameras we used when you took me to San Francisco for the first time. The pictures we took on that trip... we were both so happy.  That was such a simpler time.  It seems like the only songs that come on the radio are the ones we would listen to together.  I had been planning out everything I wanted to show you for when you would come to my campus over spring break.  Now I can't go anywhere on campus without thinking of you.

I keep reading the letter you wrote when you broke up with me over a year ago, wishing you could say those things again.  Say that even though we can't date anymore, we can still be best friends.  Jasmine, the truth is, you ARE my best friend, and I'm afraid I've lost that too.  I never would have expected you to say that quote again today on Skype.

     ""He's not perfect.  You aren't either, and the two of you will never
      be perfect.  But if he can make you laugh at least once, causes
      you to think twice, and if he admits to being human and making
      mistakes, hold onto him and give him the most you can... He'll give
      you a part of him he knows you can break.  Don't hurt him, don't
      change him,and don't expect more than he can give... Smile when
      He makes you happy, yell when he makes you mad, and miss him
      when he's not there.  Love when there is love to be had.""
            -Bob Marley

I have no idea how I can make it through the night.  It's 2:30 in the morning where you are, I hope you're sleeping.  I can't stop wondering what you're doing and I know you've been doing the same.  You weren't ready to let go, and I don't think I was either.  But what else could I do?  Try a fifth time?  Wind up getting hurt again?  God, I don't think there is anything in your past that could hurt me as bad as I feel right now, though.  I have never experienced this, just as I had never experienced love.

You probably hate me, and you will almost certainly never read this, but if you do, then I just want to say I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for doing this to you.  I wish I could say ""I love you"" one more time, but I've taken the plunge.  There is no going back now.

You are the one person that has always understood me, you are the one person I've always completely confided in, and you are the one person that always knows how to make me smile and have a good time. I never could look at you as just a friend, you were always the girl I had feelings for, and I have watched you become a woman that I am even more fond of.

To think that a decade ago, we were sitting in science class together, laughing and just being stupid kids. All those wasted years when we had no cares in the world, and all that time I let pass me by when I just wanted to tell you how I felt. How could I possibly risk losing the best friend I ever had? Afterwards, we went our separate ways. We were still in the same state and we kept in touch, but for all those years of college, we rarely saw each other. Yet every time we were able to meet, it felt like nothing had changed. We'd spend hours catching up, telling each other everything. Every time we met, we'd always have someone else in our lives though, and the chance to tell you always seemed more and more distant. Over the years however, I slowly and surely made those emotions disappear. You are my best friend, I've never wanted to lose that and convinced myself that I wanted nothing more. By the time we graduated, I thought I had succeeded.

Last year though, it all came rushing back. Our visit started off exactly like any other. We were smiling, laughing, hugs were given, and drinks were had. As the night went on and our friends dropped off one by one until it was only us though, you began to tell me the one thing you'd been holding back. I've never been so frightened or scared as when you told me about your abusive ex. You know me better than anyone, I rarely get upset. Listening to your story though, I was shaking with rage. It killed me knowing what had happened to you. As the night went on, you got more and more drunk and began trying to make some terrible decisions. I stopped you with the help of our mutual friend, but you were furious. I don't think I've ever seen you so upset about anything, and neither had our friend. Her and I talked and we agreed she would take you home for the night, but as I gave you a final hug and promised to come see you in the morning, you held on to my arm and silently whispered while crying, ""Please stay with me tonight. I'm scared to be alone"".

You are the strongest, most independent person I've ever known. I don't think anyone had ever seen that side of you. I went with you to her house and spent the entire night holding you as you cried yourself to sleep. That wall I had built up for years disappeared that night. I realized all over again how much you meant to me. I never wanted to see you hurt again. Part of me wanted to finally tell you the truth and I even told our friend everything, but I could never bring myself to do it. As we parted ways, we promised to keep in touch more often, and we've done fairly well at that ever since. Ever since though, I've always had these feelings in the back of my mind and wonder what to do.

These are my honest, unfiltered feelings. I've always cared for you, quite possibly I've always loved you. The fact that we'll be in the same city for the first time in six years only makes these thoughts of mine race even faster and question what I'm supposed to do and how I'm supposed to act, having my best friend by my side again. Do I continue to live the lie and never risk the amazing friendship that I have, or do I admit all of these feelings to you and hope for the one unanswered desire I've always had to be fulfilled?

It would have been so nice to have been able to have a decent relationship with you. We tried. We used to try to include you, even though you you were a know-it-all, and drove us insane. I wish your chief fault was that you were just annoying. I really wish I could have not spent the last ten years wanting to punch you in the face as hard as I can.

First, inviting my husband's (literally) crazy ex to be your BFF was not just a poor decision. It meant that your children had to navigate her crazy talk about their father during a time when that was difficult. The fact that you too seemed to morph past reality to fit hers was just the icing on the cake. When you moved her in, and made your home unlivable for the children, well, that sucked. They chose to spend their time to be with us, rather than have their clothes smell like cigarettes and pot and cat piss. 

When you moved away during their formative years to be with your alcoholic boyfriend, we were relieved. It meant we might have a chance to keep them safe and happy for awhile, anyway. The time they spent at your house hungry, with an empty refrigerator, so you could spend all your time at the bar? That sucked a lot. When you moved away, that ended, at least for the school year. We could feed them good food, and know they were actually making it to school. Getting help on their homework. 

But you really made up for it during the summer time, trying to be Cool Mom--trying so hard you nearly drove us to call the cops, though we refrained because we didn't want to make your kids have to deal with that. That whole thing you did during vacation, when you inconvenienced everyone so your underaged daughter could sleep with her 18 year old boyfriend? That's called facilitation. And it made me sick to my stomach. I wish you understood how hard it is for a girl to date when her mother treats every boyfriend she has as if he's the new son-in-law. It's so fucked up, but you keep doing it. The latest situation, we avoided it--but only because your daughter is more adult than you are, and can see reason. Thank god for that. 

I now wonder a lot if you secretly want her to get pregnant and be stuck in this town forever. If you want her to fail so that it will validate how much she is like you. 

You never attended parent-teacher conferences. You never went to  concerts. You never paid for a damn thing, just about. I can probably count the home-cooked meals you served them on two hands. I took them clothes shopping. I spent whatever I had to give them the privilege of vacations. To make sure they could do at least some of the things their more wealthy friends did. 

 I used to go to the bar all the time, because I didn't have children. I gave that up when I started being your children's stepmom. You never stopped though. I watched you become friendly with all my former  friends, and tell them all what great kids you had, using it as evidence of what a great mom you were. I had to listen to people talk about what a great mom you had to be, because they knew you, and see you were so nice, and see, your kids were so polite and so smart--it must have been you who made them that way. Instead of their father, who didn't go to the bar, and I, who didn't go to the bar either. We became invisible, and you were the visible one. But we were the parents, and you were the barfly. 

When you told people how hard it was to be a single mom? That really made me laugh. If only you were a mom. If only you had enough self-reflection to realize you've been more like an older sister. If only you realized that living a college lifestyle for your whole life isn't a life. (Especially if you haven't been in college for 20 years.) 

Your kids truly are great kids. They are very smart. They will do well in life, no thanks to you, though I'm sure you will brag about it to your drunken pals. I'm sure you'll take credit. Your denial about your parenting drives me crazy. Your ability to spend money on everything but your children--that also drives me crazy. I don't know how I'm going to handle graduation, and smiling and being friendly to you, when what I really want to do is choke the life out of you. 

I try to feel sorry for you. I try to let it go, and realize I've been given a great gift--your children. But for years, I've had to keep that space open for you to step up. Not being too mommy-like, because I don't want them to resent me, or think I'm trying too hard. Trying to hold back so they don't think I'm trying to replace you. I've loved them, and not been able to be the mom they needed. 

I do despise you. I long for the day when I won't want to punch you in the face as hard as I can.

I wanted to hold you, feed you, comfort you when you're sick or sad, be your biggest fan, teach you things. I wanted to see your dad hold you and love you, play with you, help me raise you. I wanted to see you grow from baby to child to teenager to adult. All these things that I looked forward to, they were gone in just a few hours. I still can't fully comprehend it. I will never have you back. 

So, I just wanted to let you know that Mom will always love you. I don't have to see your face, hear your voice or feel you nuzzled in my chest to know that. Your dad and I broke up not long after we lost you, and I'm really starting to feel happy with a very nice man. Wherever you are, I hope you're not upset. Can you even feel anger or sadness or happiness? Can you feel anything? That's what scares me, baby. I'm afraid that there really is nothing more for you. I never felt the need to believe in an afterlife until you died, but it's the last little bit of hope that I have - that you're living a better life somewhere else. I want to believe such a thing so badly. Either way, I should be happy. At least I know that wherever you are - if you're anywhere at all - you aren't feeling pain. 

No matter what occurs in my life, you will always be on my mind. Even if I have more children, you will always be my first. You are not forgotten, and will never be forgotten. I love you so very much, my sweet baby girl.

I know we never really stopped being friends, but we didn't speak to each other for weeks, then randomly bumped into each other in town. It feels weird to have spent pretty much 9 hours with you in town and about. Weird and good. What's weirder is the next night we were having sex. If I felt such a way, I'd be thinking it was a touch fast, but I liked it.

But yeah, I know you call yourself a lesbian and I'm a dude, so I was very surprised when you said you were considering having sex with me. For me, it was a pretty good feeling for a girl I know to say 'yeah, I'll sleep in the same bed as you, if that's alright?' despite the fact I knew nothing would happen (also, I'm glad you didn't find my 'inappropriate boner' comment weird) but I know we flirted a bit that evening (do you know how hard it is to flirt with a lesbian?), but I never imagined it'd lead anywhere. I'm glad it did though, and that it wasn't some drunken decision, we were both pretty sober by then, and this is why:

After no kind of intimacy for roughly two years, no girlfriend, no casual sex, barely any hugs and everything, I'd convinced myself I was better off alone and didn't need anyone else. But when you were laying in my bed afterwards, stroking my back, I felt.. happy. For the first time in 2 years, I felt safe and that perhaps life isn't just a piece of shit. I'd almost forgotten what it felt like to be truly happy, but thanks to you, I remembered.

To have someone in my arms in bed, to gently squeeze while holding them and to feel them reciprocate is a feeling I think most people take for granted. If I'd almost forgotten what happiness was, I'd definitely forgotten what it felt like to be wanted. I don't know what you were feeling that night, maybe it was just you caught up in the moment, but the feeling I had when you drew my hand closer to you and gave the impression you wanted me closer, even though I don't think I could've been, is a feeling I'll never forget. I don't ever want it from my mind because if it goes, I'll be back to my old, cynical and pessimistic self again and I don't want that.

So yeah, thank you. Not for having sex with me, but for reminding me that perhaps life isn't all that bad. For making me feel like someone wanted me.

In three hours, you did more for me than you know. You'll never realise that, of course, because I'd never tell you. But you changed me that night for so much the better and for that, I'm thankful. 

Now, let's just hope I don't cock up our friendship with this, eh?

Sometimes, the way you treat me gets me so wild. Other times, you make me want to rip out my hair in frustration, confusion. You say one thing, and instead do the fucking opposite. 

Like last night. 

I understand we're FWB (1 year now), but we both know it goes a littler father than that. You know it, but you won't freaking admit it. And that's why I hate you only for that. 

At your friend's costume party, you hug me, you cup my face in your hands and smile. You leave me for a split second, and another guy comes up to me for conversation. He wants to hang out sometime and asks for my number. Why not, I think in drunken stupor. He seems nice. As the digits pop on his screen, you come in between us out of nowhere.

""C, what you doin'? What you doin', man?""
""Just talking to her, man. What's up?""
""Oh, you're talking to her? Why do you have your phone out? You asking her out?""
""Just to hang out, man.""
""This is my girl."" You're already up in his face. You're almost getting in fighting stance. What are you doing, A? I ask. I come in between you both, and push you away. What are you doing? Why does it matter?
""Dude, I didn't know."" And he runs off. 

You ask me if he was bothering me. I shake my head and say no. You grab my hand and tell me to just tell other people I'm with you. My heart is doing flips. ""I'm with you."" I've always wanted to hear you say that. I want to tell you I'm hopelessly, madly in love with you. I want to be there for you every step of the way. 

Skip forward to the bed scene. We're done, getting into bed. Somehow, I don't know how we talk about things between us. Then, you drop this bomb on me. 
""I like how we can hang out and be awesome friends, but I don't think I could be romantic toward you."" 
I stare into the dark, my forehead wrinkling. All the other times we've talked about this, I've kept quiet at my end. Just accepted it, whatever. Last night, for some reason, I just get fed up. 

""Bull shit."" Sorry, you say, I didn't hear you. ""BULL SHIT.""
I ask you about all the other times. What WERE those?! I understand that you're different. You have a totally different thinking from a majority of people. But you're saying you absolutely have no feelings toward me.

""Zero."" You dick. 

And from there, we drift off to sleep, my face wet with silent, angry tears. 
I hate this feeling inside of me. I want to just quit you, but I know that in only a couple days everything will seem like sunshine. And that sunshine feels amazing -- it's so warm and inviting, happy.

All of you.,throwittwhere,20,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/10abhp/to_my_crushes_i_remember_you_all_of_you/,"And I miss you. Each one who has been of importance. Everyone one of you who has gone, left, or rejected me. I have burned your names into my memory. It's childish and silly, but I miss all of you. When I'm in bed and cannot sleep, you always come to mind. I imagine you there, your warmth, your body, just for the comfort. To touch, to embrace you.  

To Lily,  
Oh WHY did you have to despise me so? So completely and honestly? I don't know, I was a dick back then, but I tried my best for you. I approached with a smile, I held back terrible jokes, and I tried not to be creepy. I loved you so *much.* Every part of you. Your voice, so perfect and lilting, filled with sarcasm and wit. So loud and confident and still somehow shy, you were amazing in every way. Your skin, so amazing and smooth. Pale as death and filled with freckles, adding something perfect to your being. Your thin, slender frame I remember still, and I try to hold you at night. Your face, I will remember always. Eyes such beautiful, muddy green. Not sparkling clear but amazing for that. Your face I could stare at for hours, and I have. I want you, and each cruel rebuttal was a stab at my heart.  

To Eva,  
Oh, miss you. Not as strong as some others, but more time to spent with you, and more for me to remember. Your hair, a blonde almost white, went around your face perfectly. Your body, so slender and slim, dressed in the most amazing ways. The most perfect ways.  
I went to facebook and looked for you last week. It's not good, I know, but I was curious at all those I left behind. And God, you got beautiful. I wasn't sure how you would turn out but you got so beautiful.  

To Tori,  
I think I miss you most of all. Of course I should. We only met for two weeks, and those times not even half an hour, but what times they were! Maybe I just wasn't with you long enough for it to get stale, but no matter, I treasure those moments like no other. I also treasure the regret which welled in my throat as you walked away, cries of praise and love straining to get out, squirming in my chest.  
Your words I miss most of all. Oh yes, you were beautiful, but it is that with your words which made you so amazing. Your eyes a hazel almost-red, I remember staring into. I just want to touch you, not in a sexual way, and that would be alright. To touch your arm, so perfectly slim. I guess you're sensing my type here, but what can I do? Your energy, your love, were brilliant. But what I long for, almost as much as you, are the conversations we had over the phone.  
Oh god, we would talk for hours, none of it awkward. I think you're the reason I dislike text today. Each one is a separate message, stuck in a loop, with so many underscores of meaning in meaningless phrases. Our talks were amazing, perfect. I don't know about you, but for me they were. The flow, and how we managed it. I miss how you would listen to me, how you would sometimes even ask for me to talk. No one listens to me anymore, nobody really cares. It would be just you and me, talking into the night, and that's what I miss.  
My greatest regret with you, other than never valiantly pursuing you, is that it ended with such terrible mediocrity. With such normality and awkwardness. There was nothing amazing and shocking about it, as a person like you deserved. I did nothing you deserved. There were times I'd be longing after you, thinking back, and I'd realize it was only a few weeks or a month. Then, later and much sadder, when I realized it was a year. Two. It has almost been three now, but I remember you still. I think of calling you even now, but it's been too long, too far, too much.  

To Madisons,  
You were hot. I might forget you, but I masturbated to you for a few months. Maybe I'll remember.  
Also Justice. You might have liked me, I don't know.  

To Ceili,  
Again, it is repeated! I see even less of a reason for your hatred of me than from Lily. Why, tell me WHY. I've barely spoken to you, and both of those were on good terms, but you still shun me so! I thought you enjoyed the conversation! Your steadfast refusal to talk to me is a wrenching knife in my heart everytime I see you. Which is far too often. As said, there is so little reason. All the people to talk to, hang with, those are *my* friends, the people who have accepted *me.* I assume it's for a reason. But you still refuse to even acknowledge me. And you, everything you say and do is so amazingly perfect, so adorable and pristine! I've tried to hate you for it, I've tried, but every time you talk it just hurts. Just makes me love you more. My blind love refuses to be replaced with blind hate.

This is Steve. I'm the young man who temped at your workplace in the production department.

I'm not there anymore, and I'm almost positive you had a lot to do with that.

I never tried to do anything to harm you. I never made a single desparaging remark about you - neither to your face nor behind your back. I was very appreciative of your suggestions you gave me during my first week of employment at Omni on how to increase my production numbers.

When Forge Industrial Staffing placed me at Omni, I was thrilled. Here I had found a company that was small, yet it wasn't in danger of being swallowed by a larger manufacturer. Small meant good, because I knew the production supervisor didn't make a name for himself there by firing as many people as he possibly could.

A couple of days before my last day working, someone began screwing around with the dials on the machines I was operating. I didn't think it was you at first. Initially I figured it was tampering done by someone from the office who was mistaken about how fast a carbide drill may rotate and punch through steel. I informed the CNC programmer, and he informed me everyone there knew that the speed dials weren't to be messed with. Later that day, I saw you talking to Wally, and immediately after your conversation he came to me and warned me not to attempt to reprogram the machines.

I told him the truth: I hadn't any idea how to program them, programming wasn't my job, and that I didn't want to produce any bad parts or damage the machine. Oh, and let's not forget the danger associated with with them. I certainly didn't want to hurt myself or anyone else.

You, however, had different priorities. I now realize you were the one who decided to screw up my production quotas, and you also didn't care about the safety of other people or the money it would cost to replace the parts you destroyed. Now that I think about it, you probably didn't like me for a couple of reasons. First, I don't leave my workstation unless I have to. I'm a full-grown man, so I am capable of holding in my piss. You seemed to have a big problem staying in one spot and taking care of your responsibilities. Second, I mind my own damn business. If I see someone being lazy, I don't stop production to walk over to them or anyone else to complain about it. You seemed to always be very interested in what other people were doing, but you had real big problems pointing that critical eye at your own responsibilities. 

If I were you, I would have been very worried the bosses were going to notice this temp who has only been around a few weeks is blowing your numbers out of the water. A mature thing to do would have been to simply acknowledge your mistakes and make a better attempt at working harder. You chose to get your husband, a mutual boss of ours, to put in a bad word about me to HR.

I told Wally about the tampering, and he non-chalantly replied that he thought someone who worked there didn't like me for whatever reason, but that if I continued to arrive at work every day and work my hardest I would be fine. I had him explain to me where the dials need to be pointing before I begin running parts, so that the next time I went on break and came back and noticed they'd been tampered with I could fix them. Lunch time came, and when I returned I noticed the dials had been tampered with again. I fixed them, and when I turned around to grab an unfinished part I noticed you were watching me very intently, like you wanted to see what would happen next. So I showed you: I ran the part, and it came out with no incident. I measured the cuts and they were right on target. Then you stormed off to complain about something to someone instead of continuing work.

All I can say is I feel bad for the person you conned into sabotaging my machine for you.

Later that day the temp agency called me to inform me Omni didn't want me back the next day. I asked them why, and they told me there were ""production issues.""

I pity you. You know you can't make your way through the world by your own willpower, so you married one of the higher-ups at the factory in order to insure you always had a paycheck. You take from the world, and you give nothing back. They have a word for that: parasite. You know, like a cockroach. That's what you are. I signed up for classes at the local community college so I don't have to live at the mercy of jackasses like you or ruthless production supervisors anymore. You're going to be driving to the same building day after day, and when you get there you will perform the same repetitive tasks moment after moment. I don't know where I'm going, but it has to be better than that. 

Have a great day. I'm sure your decisions won't haunt you when you're laying on your deathbed and your life is flashing before your eyes and all you can see is the faces of people you used for your own selfish and lazy motives.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_stqum,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/stqum/to_the_social_parasite_called_sue_at_omni_tool/,

We met over 10 years ago. I fell in love with you but I was even more fucked up than I am now. We dated, hung out, dated some more and I dumped you. And a few months later I dumped you again. However, weeks after that we got together again and after a while we got more serious. You helped me fight my depression and you helped me to stop hurting myself. I love you for that. Any other guy would've just ditched me and my stupid problems.

Shortcut to now. We've been married for 3 years and together for almost 10. But lots of things have happened between us. You cheated on me, once, years ago. I forgave you because I thought that would be the best for us, for me. I had to take multiple jobs to support us while you were trying to set up your first company. I couldn't keep up with my studies, so I quit my masters. I got more and more depressed over the years, but couldn't find a way to tell you because I wanted you to be happy more than anything else in the world.

My urges to cut myself again came back over a year ago. Every time we had a fight, I wanted to hurt myself so badly. When I lost my job, I was seriously considering killing myself. You know what kept me from doing that? The idea that I would never hug my cats again. The idea that I would cause my parents and rest of my family unimaginable pain.

The depression is still here. It never really went away. I'm fighting it, with the help of a therapist. I know I have issues. I know you didn't ask for any of this. But it feels like you're just not there for me. I can't open up to you. I don't like being around you anymore. I dread the idea of having sex with you because I know I'll be doing it because you want it, not because I want it.

I have known that I was bisexual since I was 14, but after making out with girls multiple times (which you didn't mind at all) I'm starting to think that I like girls a lot more than I like guys. I don't mind kissing them for minutes like I hate with you, I don't dread the idea of having sex them.

I've got a long way to go, and I think I need to do it alone. Not because I don't love you anymore – I do – but because you deserve someone who's honestly in love with you. You're an amazing person. You're driven, you're ambitious, you're funny, you're talented and you're so beautiful. But you're not the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. I thought you were, but I was wrong. And for that I am so sorry.

I'm sorry to bother you, as I'm sure you are very busy these days, but I write of an urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention..Its your son. I know where your son is.   He and his mother began renting a room from me this past summer, and in the beginning, everything was fine. He was a bit rambunctious, but I chalked it up to typical, 4 yr, old boy behavior. Then, after the third, or fourth time I awoke to find him standing next to my bed, his face 2 inches from mine, trying to suck out my soul with his eyes, I knew he was no ordinary little kid. Now, don't get me wrong..that whole soul stealing thing is really cool, but, I just can't have it going on under my roof. In addition to that, he has crazy freak outs when he doesn't get his way, has no respect for his mom (or anyone else), and does nothing he's asked to do, as in ""you need to not talk so loud..everyone is asleep"" to which he replies,( yelling even louder)"" I""LL YELL IF I WANT!"", going so far as to yell right into the ear of the nearest sleeping person he can find. He lies, and is a master at manipulation. I have a perfect example..one night, his mom is cooking dinner, I'm in my room, and he is in his room, with a friend of his moms. I hear him say ""watch what I can do"" and then I heard what sounded like  glass shattering everywhere. It turned out, he had, for no good reason, taken his moms full length mirror off the wall, placed it face down, and jumped on the back of the mirror, destroying it. He then , almost immediately started saying it was an ""accident.""  His moms friend, who, I believe has known all along that this kid is from the depths of hell, told him that it was in no way an accident, and to go tell his mom what he just did. When he got to the kitchen, I heard him say, ""mom, your mirror broke"", to which she replied, ""oh, that's ok."" He went back to the bedroom, and said in a nasty little voice ""my mom said its ok."" The friend, angry and frustrated, went and told the mom what had really happened. She confronted the little demon, and he, right in front of the witness, told her that he didn't do it! He insisted it happened by itself, and that he had nothing to do with it. Then, he went so far as to blame the witness! When none of that worked, he resorted to fake tears and pretended he was sorry. He must have apologized 50 times..each apology getting louder and more insistent. It didn't take long until he had her feeling bad for him and as soon as he knew that, the tears stopped as quickly as they began, and he was smiling.  He had at least 3 more ""episodes ' that night. Recently, I overheard him blaming me, for whatever damage he had done.  Keep in mind that this is just one small example of the terror your offspring inflicts on all of us..and he does this every day.

I discovered his affinity for animals one day when the dog came running into my bedroom, and hid behind me, totally out of breath. He came in after the dog and upon asking him what he was doing , he said he and the dog were ""playing."" He was holding a plastic hatchet behind his back, and ""playing"" involved him chasing the dog, hatchet held high, swinging at the poor thing every few seconds. Another time, it was a golf club. I'm sure , like any good little son of Satan, animal vivisection is right around the corner.

I have heard him say things to his mom, that I can't believe come from a 4yr. old.  Examples? Sure...""We both know you're a much better liar than I am"", ""You never do anything for me"", and ""No, I tell YOU what to do"" are a few of my favorites. He says these things in a shrill, whiny voice that makes me want to shove knitting needles into my ears.  He barges into peoples rooms without knocking, runs out into the street in the middle of the night, saying that ""his mom says its ok"", and once, while babysitting, I caught him trying to hang from the flat screen TV mounted on the wall in their bedroom, and again, tried to say ""my mom says its ok."" His mom can't even go to the bathroom in peace. Every time she tries, he bangs on the door in total meltdown mode, demanding she open the door. If she says no, he starts screaming that he has to (all of a sudden) go to the bathroom and turns on the tears. When she opens the door, the screaming stops, and he's ""normal"" again, usually telling her to ""get off the toilet"", or ""get out of the shower"" because he doesn't have her full attention for 5 min, and of course, he never really needs to use the toilet.  Forget taking him out in public!  Let me tell you, if he was my kid, and pulled any of this shit..all I can say is that it only would have taken once. As it is, he is making me crazy. Just his voice alone can make me cringe. His tantrums and back talk make me wish we were back in the days when disciplining your child involved going outside to pick a switch. I raised 4 kids, and don't believe in spanking, but in this case, I'd be spanking up a storm.

Now, you, being the anti-Christ and all, are probably grinning from ear to ear, as the proud papa of a son who is a ""chip off the old block."" Well, congratulations. I'm sure he'll be ready to take over the family business in no time. SO, why not COME GET HIM!  Take his mom to court, and get full custody of your little Lucifer.  He belongs in an environment more suitable to his..um..personality type, where his evil would be nurtured and encouraged to grow to its full potential.  If you don't want to go the legal route (and why would you?) just say the word, and I'll meet you somewhere, with the kid, and you can have him.  There is enough hell in this world..more than enough, actually. Please, do us all a favor and take this one little piece of it home with you. Satan, you've been a dead beat dad of the worst kind and the state of  California doesn't look to kindly upon dead beat dads. Things could get ugly, not to mention expensive if some random person (cough) was to encourage your ex-whatever its called when you have Satan's baby, to go after your ass in court for child support. I'm not making a threat, I'm just sayin.' Be a responsible father..Do the right thing, ok? Thanks!

                                              Love Always,

We talked every day pretty much, for a week or two. You told me I was the nicest, coolest person you had ever talked to. You told me your life was shit and you wanted to move to either my country or another one. After some time you decided you wanted to move to my country.

You told me you felt alone, like nobody understood you, and that you thought it was wonderful that I finally came around so you could feel supported, and not like an alien anymore. 

We had known each other for something like a week, and you were already so attached to me. You were even planning to change your sleep schedule so you could talk to me more often even with the time zones!

I was just happy to feel like someone liked me.

I'm sorry I mistook the selfish feeling of content because you liked me with me liking you.

I didn't, and deep down I knew it. I knew that deep down, I just wanted to have *someone*. A couple of days after I told you I liked you, I got back to you and told you I had made a mistake.

How foolish I was. I toyed with your feelings. I didn't want to, but I did.

We stopped talking. Then, you just disappeared completely. You stopped posting status updates.

I'm sorry I made your shit life shittier.

I don't know where you are or even where you live anymore and there's no way I can ever find you; I suppose in a way by writing this and putting it here I'm setting these words free in the world and perhaps by some unknowable law of good karma balance wherever you are, you'll smile and feel good for no reason. 

Here's all I know: You were 20 when I first talked to you, which would put you in about your mid-50s now. You were a volunteer for west orange county hotline and I was a horribly depressed teenage girl who called in just to talk to someone. That someone was you.

We talked every week for months. Just about stuff. Cats. Music. Jokes. I talked about my life and the things that made me so unhappy, and you listened and made me laugh and showed me caring and compassion. You told me little things about your life: it sticks out in my mind even after so many years about you taking a walk with your roommate around your new neighborhood, near south coast plaza. 

Over the course of those few months we developed a bond. You told me how you wished things were different and we could be together, but of course because you were a volunteer at a hotline and I was a sad girl calling in, it wasn't right. It took me years to understand that you were doing the right thing by not meeting me, but I did come to understand. Most important, you were a kind, gentle, compassionate soul and you helped me in so many ways, because I wanted to be someone you could be proud of and love. Someone decent, compassionate, honest, honorable, and caring. And that changed me for the better.

And then that time I ran away and called you from the police station after I got caught, it ended up the last time we spoke. My mom sent me to my dad's house for a couple months and I couldn't call you, and then when I came home and called you they told me you had moved to Wisconsin. I don't know if that was true or not, but true or not you weren't a volunteer there anymore and you were gone from my life. 

Now here it is, some 37 years later and I've still never forgotten you. I may not think about you every day, but I do think about you from time to time. I like to imagine that you met a woman who was deserving of your kind and generous nature. I imagine you finished school and got a good career, got married, had some lovely children, loved people and embraced life and that all good things came to you. As for me, well... the road was bumpy sometimes but in the end things turned out well for me. It's been a good life, really. 

I just wanted to tell you that I never forgot you, and that my life was and is better for the part you played in it. I am a better human being because of you, and for that I will always love you.

I endlessly admire your method of living; your calmness, your ""don't panic""-ness, how you approach everything so thoughtfully, your lack of mindless hate for anything. You're loyal to your friends except when they're being dicks, you stand up for people even if it isn't necessarily your place to do so, and you're not afraid to call someone out when they're wrong.

I love the way you never sat in your desk correctly, your slightly odd teeth, the jacket you always wear that you have in 3 colors, your adorable artwork (and the fact that you would always get mad at me for calling it ""adorable""), the way you run your fingers through your hair, the way you smile when you're proud of yourself but trying not to brag, the way you talk when you know what you're talking about, the way your eyes light up during certain conversations, your eyes in general, the way you slap your own forehead just because you like the sound, the way you slap your own forehead because the absurdity of people is just too much sometimes, the way your hair bounces a tiny bit when you walk. 

I've fallen in love with you one word at a time, drop by drop, every glance an eighth note, part of a song that gets stuck in my head. I'm so in love with you. I can't figure out how to get it across. It's all incoherent nonsense in my head but the big picture is so clear. We would be perfect for each other.

You used to tell me that I was your 'what-if' girl. The girl you fantasized about, even when you were dating someone else. The girl you always wanted but never dreamed could want you back. The first time we kissed you were so nervous you couldn't stop shaking. That actually happened the second and third time, as well. You couldn't stop looking into my eyes, even when I took off my shirt to show my awesome bra. You kissed me with such passion.

Then for the first few months we dated, we spent all our time in bed. Not even having sex all the time, but just being together. We'd skip appointments, class, outings with friends because the best thing was just to be together. So obvious that we didn't even think to say it. 

Remember when we spent that entire weekend together, in your bed, watching Scrubs and talking and fooling around? We never planned on spending the weekend together, but everytime one of us was supposed to leave we decided not to. I remember that I was wearing your pants and refused to take them off. You pulled at the bottoms as I pulled at the waistband and somehow you managed to have me upside down, supported only by a pair of pants. I remember laughing so hard, being so ecstatically happy that I didn't even think of anything other than that moment. As you know, a rarity for me.

I know it all went wrong soon after. For a year now, we'd had fights, fights because we just don't understand each other when we're fighting, fights because we just don't have time for each other, fights because we want different things.

It makes sense that we're not together. I know it does. But I cannot help crying whenever I'm alone. I cannot help looking through our old fb conversations, I cannot help writing about everything we ever shared. You were my true love.

I think about you all the time. Everything reminds me of you. As in, I see a box of cereal and think ""that boy likes cereal."" I'm kind of concerned about this, as it feels rather obsessive and I imagine if you could somehow see into my mind that you would be very frightened. It's a bit exhausting. Sometimes I want space in my thoughts for myself. 

2. At least once a day I get hopelessly overwhelmed by feelings of inadequacy and imagine just running away from us before you have a chance to find out what a fucking loser I am. I didn't think I was a loser before we started hanging out. Well, I thought I was slightly less loserish. Being around your friends makes me feel like a gangly, awkward fifteen year old girl trying to fit in with the cool kids all over again. Truthfully I'm ok with who I am... I'm just not sure if they understand that person. Sometimes I'm not sure if you do either.

3. I have darkness in me. My past is dark. My present is dark sometimes. I had to grow up quickly and in all honesty I've never truly felt safe. I have daddy issues. I take 50mgs of Sertraline everyday and that's kind of why I've never had an orgasm with you. I've kept the scars covered up because I'm afraid they will disgust you. I'm not sure if you've ever seen ones this bad before.

4. You don't have to try to impress me. I'm already impressed. In fact, I want to impress you. Hard, into my vagina, right now :)

5. ""I think I'm falling in love with you."" Or ""you make me so happy."" Or ""I appreciate how kind you are to me"". I've thought them a million times. Never said them.

I haven't seen you in two years.  My suggestion a week ago that we grab a beer and catch up threw you into such a goddamn panic that I wanted to follow up with, ""Don't worry, it's not a marriage proposal.""  You're so fucking full of yourself.  I couldn't possibly want to just be your friend, right?  Having a beer with me would make me think we're an item or something.

Why is it this way with so many of the men in my life?  I'm not allowed to care for you as a friend as a person without you worrying that I'll get the wrong impression.  We were good friends once; I wish we could get it back but you're so fucking paranoid about giving someone the wrong idea that it will never happen.

And for your information, my birthday sucked.  I didn't see any of my family.  I invited fifteen people out for a burger (including you), and a grand total of two showed up.  One of the people was the one who goaded me into having a get-together in the first place.  All you could muster was a ""sorry I couldn't make it"" text six hours after the fact.

So you know what?  Fuck you.  Fuck you and the white horse you rode in on.  I realize now that there's no way I could love you the way I used to.  You won't even accept my friendship.

In that 11 years, a few things have come up that I would like to say to you. I will not form proper paragraphs, and I will not use ""MLA format"", because I know that it will drive you nuts. A petty win, but a win nonetheless.  
  
You don't look anything like the man I married. I know that this seems vain and horrible, but it is in fact a concern. And, aside from a few gray hairs, I look EXACTLY the same as when we met. You, when first I saw you, bore a striking resemblance to Chris Evans. Now you look an awful lot more like Chris Farley. You used to work out at least a few times a week. Now you sometimes go weeks without leaving the house. You've gained over 100 pounds. I understand that we were in our early 20's when we met, and a man's metabolism slows down later in life. But that doesn't mean that this extra 100 makes sense. It's all because you rarely move from your chair in front of the computer. Sometimes you are there when I go to work, still there when I get home, still there when I go to bed, still there when I wake up and leave for work again. Add into that your three pack a day habit, (except the days when it's FOUR!), and you have a sure-fire recipe for death.  
Now let's get into your non-existent sex drive. To be fair, I'm not nearly the sexual beast I was when we met. We are both older now, and I spend a lot of time at work or doing things for/with the kids. We don't have the time anymore to just spend a weekend laying around naked and being depraved. But COME ON! It's been a year since we both had participatory sex. A YEAR!!!! And if I try to talk to you about it, you just shut me down with ""You're pressuring me, and that makes it worse."". Okay, I get that. But if it were really some sort of physical or mental issue that was stopping you, you wouldn't masturbate so many times a week. I know you think I don't know, but I do. And do you ever stop to think of how that makes me feel? You can still get it up, just not for me. You can still have urges, just not for me.  
  
Next up: I work, you don't. At all. You like to talk about the time you worked for 14 months while I just worked part-time. Yeah, that happened. For 14 months out of 11 years. For almost all of the rest of that time, I have worked. Full time plus. While you have sat on your ass at home, occasionally doing some housework, and cried about how you have it so tough. And now you are going back to school. For a degree that you cannot get a job in. You are a felon. You will NEVER be allowed to work in your field. You are a schizophrenic. You will NEVER be allowed to work in your field. You haven't held a job for over 14 months in the last 11 years, and the bullshit jobs you have had have always ended because you walked off angry or got in a fight. And of course the fights were NEVER your fault. The whole fucking world is out to get you, because you are smarter than them, better than them, more together and qualified than them. And then, to top off this ice cream sundae, you bitch at me because I don't make enough money. About how if I had more education I could make more. About how we should move out of state. I can't get a better education, because someone has to pay the bills and raise the kids. We can't move, because even living in the low cost of living area that we are in, in the cheapest possible rental situation, I can't make ends meet. I need your help. I NEED YOUR HELP.  
  
There is so much more that I want to rant to you, and so much more that needs to be said, but I just can't. My thoughts are racing, my eyes are teary, and I just can't do it. I don't know how long I can hang on... I really don't.  
  
So I will close this letter with a TL;DR, because you always tell me that I talk all the time without saying anything. Here goes:  
I would like to get rightly fucked by the man I actually married. A good looking guy with a job and hopes for a decent future. Instead, I have you, and I don't think I can live like this for much longer.

I have no obligation to drive your friends places and it is not okay to assume I will.  Yeah, it was bitchy of you.  You purposely fucking waited until she had no way to get home if I said no and then told me.  Normally, I would have driven her home because I would have felt bad and been guilted into it.  Not anymore.  I'm not your fucking mom, I don't have to do shit with you.  Your mom doesn't even put up with that, why would I?  I'm tired of being used by you and A as your personal fucking chauffeur.  Oh, you want to go see a movie at the theater near my house, but want me to drive 15 minutes to pick you up and then drive back to the theater?  No.  I've reached my fucking limit.  Every time you ask me if I can drive L anywhere, I get more and more annoyed.  I resent her, and I barely know her.  Just because you want her around constantly and assume I'll always drive everyone everywhere.  You know that girl you dislike from school?  You're just like her right now, always asking for rides and assuming I'll do it without planning your own rides.  Plan ahead.  It's not my responsibility to plan your rides.  And that's not even all you that pisses me off.  You sit there, and you talk about how much you don't like someone because they were mean to one of your friends.  You do that with whoever A doesn't like, you did that with someone that hurt O.  But the moment I mention that M fucking threatened me and that I don't like her, you're suddenly really fucking close to her despite the fact that you didn't know her until later.  Why the fuck is it only me?  You're supposed to be my best friend.  So why do I feel like you care about everyone else more?  I don't see how it's fair to dislike N because of something A told you, but then invalidate my experiences with M and talk to her anyways.  And this morning, you texted me saying you left your shit in my car, an expect me to drive it to your fucking school at 7 in the morning?  No.  I don't think so.  I don't think I want to be friends with you anymore.  I definitely need to reevaluate our friendship, because I'm tired of this.

I have so many questions I wish I could ask you in person, but I guess you wanting me out of your life makes that kind of impossible...heh. 3 weeks ago when we officially broke up it didn't seem that way, you even asked if we are still friends, and I really meant that ""yes"" with all my heart. All of a sudden you tell me that you won't talk to me or meet me anymore, or take part in any events organised by our mutual friends to avoid me... it destroyed me...but I guess as long as you feel it's the right thing to do for yourself, or that's what you need to move on, or for closure...

You know I haven't cried as much in the past 10 years as I have in the past 2 weeks, I guess that doesn't mean much to you anymore. I remember when you used to tell me every little detail of your day, every silly little thing you did... I've never been a particularly social person or felt any desperate need for human interaction, but you, you were the big exception. I could spend hours just listening to you talk, whether its you telling me your dreams, or calling me at 3 in the morning about a nightmare. I could just sit on a big comfy chair and cuddle with you until you started to struggle because it was getting too warm. I would do anything for a hug from you right now...but no...

I still have your various gifts in my room, some handmade, some bought. I remember you used to joke that you are filling my room up with rubbish, and that smile you would show when I kissed you and said thank you. I remember our first date when I first held your hand you laughed at me and said ""that's not how you hold hands stupid, you don't do this often do you"". And you were right. Throughout our years together you have taught me so much about how to be in a relationship, how to let someone into my life....

I am sorry that I can't promise you a future, I am sorry that I am so unsure of myself that I can't commit to you more, I am sorry that I am a boring person, I am sorry I can't make you feel in love again, I am sorry I may have wasted these few years of your life. If only I could turn back time I would fix all of these.... 

I just hope you are dealing with this better than I am, I wish I could be there to help you, but that's not what you want is it....Just remember, this is not your fault, dont feel guilty, dont apologise to me, be happy and dont cry, you remember how much it kills me to see you cry. Hell, I would have broken with me a long time ago, you managed me for 3+ years. If anything this is my fault, I've been reading up about depression recently and it seems I may have it, or have a high risk of having it. But like I said, you've given me nothing but happiness during our relationship so I know it's not you. 

I guess this really is goodbye, take care of yourself. Oh and I am sorry that I might to break one last promise, you know that I promised to stop smoking 3 years ago, yeah I might have to break that one now. Sorry.

We talked, the three of us. I bought us Venom energy drinks. We sat in the bleachers while our families did stuff involving dogs. You took pictures. Funny ones, cute ones. Our friend sat between us, but I now wish he hadn't been there.

I saw you the next day. You were even more beautiful. Of course, I was still shy. We exchanged numbers and the three of us spent the day together again. That was the last day I ever got to touch you, and the first time I hugged you. You smelled like strawberries.

Later that day, you texted me and told me you liked me. I was at Subway with my family driving home. I'll never forget my disbelief. I argued. ""But I'm fat."" ""No you don't."" and ""Haha. Funny.""

1359961711.0,20,self.UnsentLetters,17uty1,I love my girlfriend more than myself and unconditionally. ,everythingisaokay,22,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/17uty1/i_love_my_girlfriend_more_than_myself_and/,"Okay, I know this isn't in the form of a letter, but I'm not going to do that, this might have been okay on r/offmychest but everything there seemed like an angry rant, and r/confession seemed better suited for weird sexual fetishes and admitting to crimes committed years ago. This is not angry nor is it a confession to a crime so I'm posting this here. 

I have a girlfriend, her name is Lexi, and I think she's amazing. I really do. And sometimes we get in an argument and I'll try to tell myself that she's not as amazing as I make her out to be, but I can't. Everything in me thinks she's the perfect girl, like the one I'm supposed to be with. I'm not even a guy who's really into the whole idea of destiny, but everything in me feels like she and I are supposed to be together. 

I tell her these things sometimes, that I love her with everything I am, and that I love her unconditionally, I don't know if she really believes me or not, but I mean those things 100 percent. It isn't even a slight exaggeration. I would die for this girl without a 2nd thought because I value her more than I value myself. (Which is something I can't honestly say about anybody else in my life.) 

The idea of losing her is devastating to me, it would be like losing the best part of myself, and the best part of life. She absolutely makes my life complete, and it feels wonderful.

I guess I should tell you more specifically about her. She's 16, 5'2, and has blonde hair, and these large gorgeous emerald eyes. She has a sweet, soft voice, but a big laugh, one that's loud and infectious. She's a sweetheart in every way you could think of, she's thoughtful, and considerate, passionate about a lot of things, and knows how to say the most affectionate and sweet thing possible. I think this must be because it comes naturally to her, her sweetness that is, she's a very genuine person. 

She's the kind of girl who thinks a lot with her heart, and I like that about her. She's a very compassionate, and feeling person. She really truly cares about things, if we have a debate about something for example, she'll actually get fired up about it. This makes her very loving as well, I feel like I'm truly cared for, and loved by her. It's a great feeling. She's also perfect at romance, I honestly don't know how she does it, but she puts Nick Cassavetes flicks to shame. 

Other than being this wonderful, loving, adorable, individual she also has qualities that me me rationally want to be with her. She's ambitious, and hard working, she's talented and artistic. She paints incredible paintings that I think should be in galleries. Removing all of my feelings for her I still think she's insanely talented, it isn't just me being nice because she's my girlfriend, no, she is a highly intelligent, creative, and artistic individual.  

Okay, so that's a bit of a description of her. Those are all terrific reasons for me to love her the way I do, but it's more than that. There's some deeper reason that I love her that I can't even really explain. I'll say we're ""meant to be"" or ""soul mates"" because those are terms that describe it, but not in detail, it isn't really explainable in detail, at least not by me, maybe someone with better language skills could explain it in detail :d. The point is that I want to be with this girl forever, I want to spend my life with her, I want to have kids with her one day, I want all of that more than I've ever wanted anything in my entire life. We're both young now, and most likely won't be getting married for at least a few years, but I want to one day, I want to oh so bad. I don't want to be with anybody else, I can't even imagine being with anyone else, she's the one for me, and I know it. I just know it. 

I love her, a lot.

Fuck it all. I wish my brain was like a hard drive, and there was a folder named ""your name"". In it would be all my memories of you, how I met you every kiss, every hug, every moment I've spent with you. I would delete it all without hesitation. I fucking hate that idea that you were with someone else, doing things that we haven't even done because you never seemed ready for it. I hate you for caring so little about me.

Hate you for what you did to me, played around with me and threw me to the side when you got bored. I wish I never met you, never went camping that summer, so that I wouldn't even recognize your face as I walk these streets. Every time I see your face I get this lump in my throat, I can't forgive you for what you did to me. Fuck you for screwing me up and then tossing me to the side when you finally broke me over and over again. 

I wish I wouldn't have to see you ever again, you'll be like a bad dream that I would faintly remember in the morning. 

Periods of time like this, when you're completely gone from my life for a certain amount of time I feel completely fine, like I am over you. I go out party have a good time, and start to forget about you. But today needed to hand off that thing to you, and I thought I would feel fine, if not happy to see you. Then I see you and everything floods back, I put on a smile and play along. 

I am angry. I hate the fact that you got over me so fast. I hate your mentality about relationships, how easily you move on to someone else. ""my relationship with you is like my relationship with chocolate"" you said, I know it was meant as a joke, but fucking a you're right, that's exactly how it is. You binge out on me, then stow me away, and like a ""puppy"" I was always there waiting. Fuck it all. 

You know as I was flying at 50+ mph through the air after getting flung off my motorcycle, twirling through the air, seeing my motorcycle skidding and tumbling behind me. I thought I was as good as dead. I really thought I was going to die. It was strangely peaceful, and to be honest at that moment I was kind of happy, I was living a bitter yet sweet lie. That bitter sweet nostalgia of being with you. Even though knowing that once college starts you'll be gone once again, out living it up to your own standards of what college is all about. You were the one thing on my mind as I was mid flight, I wanted to see you again. How badly did I want to hug you for one last time and tell you good bye. Then upon landing, tumbling about for another 40 feet through the oncoming lane it turned out that I was alive, and that life keeps going on, in a way I almost wish it didn't. 

I hate how you treat my feelings for you as almost a tragedy, as if pitying me that I somehow still care about you. Coming back from Alaska, I remember truly looking forward to seeing your face, hell I wasn't counting on anything else, I just wanted to see you, and you didn't even give a damn, didn't care enough to even ask how I was doing.

I feel used a little bit, the only reason why we went back to being friends for a while was because things didn't work out with that guy, he turned out to be a douche who really like blow jobs. That's why you even wanted to see me, cause I always tried being there for you, and even if it's not the case I now feel that you knowing that I still care about you, needed me as a filler and someone to be there for you. I was happy to be there for you. 

You know what sucks? One day feeling loved and feeling wanted, then waking up the next day and seeing that it was all an illusion, and that I was only with you when it was convenient for you. I feel like I got played. I am looking forward to the day that I wake up and you aren't the first thing I think of.

Although I am really typing this out in anger and after watching an episode of our favorite TV show that we used to always watch together, thank you for those times you were there for me, especially that one time I called you at 7 in the morning, or that time my friend died in a crash, I know that at one point I almost managed to break down that huge wall of yours that I am now convinced is impossible to get through and get you to open up to yourself and stop running away, those were some of my happiest days, when I felt that I was finally getting through you, those were the days I felt loved. Although those times are drowned out by negative events/feelings, it's the bad stuff that tends to stand out eh? 

I know you'll read this one day when you'll get curious as to how I am doing, and maybe months down to road to see at the possibility of being friends with me. If I have managed to keep you out of my life: then I've probably been feeling fantastic, I've probably felt happy for a while. Now you know how I really felt by end of it all. Mainly really really fucking exhausted, the last half a year was hell that I don't want to live through again. Please stay out of my life once and for all. Maybe years down the road, we'll see each other among a busy crowd, smile and it'll be cool to see each other after all that time, we'll get coffee catch up a little, and continue living our separate lives.

If I continue ranting I could go on for half the night, but hell whatever I finally feel as if I took a really heavy backpack off. You'll probably be the only one who reads this far, this is a really long wall of text.

Anyway, I’m sorry I was so awkward. You’re really cute and I had a great time with you. You made it pretty obvious that you were interested in me by catching my eye and laughing at every single dumb joke I made, but I never made a move. You probably walked away thinking I wasn’t interested. Truth is, I haven’t had a girl catch my attention like you did in a long time. I guess I just kinda froze. I’m not normally this quiet and reserved; I’ve been a little off recently and seemingly have forgotten how to flirt. 

You’re really funny, have a quick wit that kept me on my toes and an adorable laugh. I like how confident you are without being full of yourself; it makes you seem down to earth and like you really understand yourself. On top of that, you have beautiful eyes, a really nice body, and a cute nose; I know you’ll have some kind of snarky comment about that last compliment. So I’ll add preemptively that I’m not really sure what makes a nose cute, but it’s something my drunken ass noticed last night

You were so funny, nerdy, sweet, and generous. I fell in love with you so fast, you seemed perfect. I was, am, head over heels for you. I still get butterflies in my tummy mixed with the ache of my broken heart.






When we first were together you told me I was perfect, too. You told me how sexy I was and how lucky you were. You told me how I made you completely sexually satisfied, like no one ever has.... But as the weeks went on, you decided I was less than perfect. You became frustrated with me, and started picking at my insecurities. You told me everything that was wrong with me and my body and face.. You cut me deeper than I've been cut in a long time. You started hurting me physically, too. It's been more than once and you don't even pretend to be sorry you did it anymore. You just tell me how it was my fault, how I was asking for it, and how I could have prevented the injury. You're sorry that I got hurt while you were pushing, shaking, throwing, shoving, or grabbing me, but not sorry you did it.






I'm at war with myself. On one part of my brain, I see your side perfectly. I feel like the worst girlfriend ever, and feel its no wonder you explode and treat me poorly and don't want me around. On the other hand, I see me trying to fix myself and help out, and be a better girlfriend, and it gets discounted. You get mad at me for the same stuff you do, and you're so judgemental, I'm afraid you may get hurt if you fall off your high horse.







I'm not sexually satisfied, I'm not emotionally satisfied. I'm scared to tell you my feelings and give you criticism for fear of sparking an argument where I end up with another bruise or sprain or broken bone, or maybe worse this time. I know I'm in an abusive relationship, but good god, you and I, when we work, we work perfectly. We can go so far together. I want to hold out for therapy and see if it gets better, but darling, I can't. I'm going to end up committing suicide if I stay with you, I'm sure. I believe all the bad things you say about me. And when you told me that I'm the cause for the lifetime of abuse I've had... Well maybe you have a point. I am the reason. I got you to hurt me when you've never hurt another girlfriend physically.






You are my sweetest, and most bitter, downfall. My first love, my greatest weakness. The man who's made me cry the most, and who's saved me. The man who throws me to the floor, tell me its my fault you did it and my fault that it hurt me, only to tend to my wounds later, wrecked with guilt, and having me tell you that its okay, don't feel bad. I shouldn't have done what I did, you were right. Oh, god.. I have to go. I really do. It's not healthy for either of us, and I don't want to hate myself anymore. I know you don't understand that, and you probably never will. You never get hurt by other peoples words, do you? You've always had such a healthy self esteem.






Well, I guess this is goodbye. I don't know if i'll ever be okay though. If I'll ever believe another man when he tells me I'm attractive. You told me how only teenage boys and drug addicts find me irresistibly sexy. I believe that. But I would rather be alone than with someone who makes me feel like I'm twelve again. That was such a dark and depressing time for me, and the only connections are, I was being abused then and it was ignored and I'm being abused now, and I'm ignoring it.




I love you is not enough, but God, do I love you. This is hard. Harder than when I quit meth, harder than anything I have ever done. I feel like a failure, and that I'm walking away from the best thing that has ever happened to me... But you're also the worst and I can't fix you. 





So, goodbye, my love. I'll miss you so much it'll be a physical ache. I'm not sure Ill get over you, but I'm only 19, so I probably will. I hope you get help, and fix whatever is hurting you so much. Maybe, someday, when we're both healthier, we can meet again and it'll work that time, but I doubt it.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_158xek,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/158xek/to_my_sweetest_most_bitter_downfall/,

I don't even know how to begin this email. I want to be as respectful as possible, and maybe I shouldn't even write it, or send it. You told me that you didn't feel the right kinds of things for me, and I believe you.

I'm writing this because I'm in so much pain. I'm in pain worse than I've felt in a very, very long time. I'm hurt even more than when my stepfather, a hero of mine, died. I'm in more pain than when I broke up with my ex of 6 years. There's a hole in my heart, and it burns right through me. I feel shattered, and I know I'm writing this from the wrong place. I'm writing this to try and convince you that you should love me. I'm writing to tell myself I did everything I could to make sure that we worked out. And this is all for the absurdly short time we went out.

But I know that you never really were that interested. You held back, purposely. Your eyes gave it away. The only time you looked, and really looked into my eyes, was when you told me you didn't have the right kinds of feelings. I should have known. I should have known because I've done the same. I've been on the other side of this conversation, and if the girl I told what you told me had emailed me telling me how much pain she was in, and to take her back? I'd be freaked out.

I was happy with you. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. A reason to hope again. I saw a girl I could be with, maybe for a long, long time. I felt safe, like I was coming home after a long trip. I gave myself to you, and I didn't hold back.

I want to ask you then, if, now that you've had a few days, if you still never felt right with me. You said you were happy with me, but also extremely anxious. I had that same feeling. I was anxious that you were going to back out at any time. I was anxious about not seeing you, or about seeing you. I was anxious when we talked about our what we were, or when I texted you the wrong thing, or when anything happened aside from sitting next to you, holding your hand.

We were supposed to be friends this summer, and yet you chose to try to get your dick wet right in front of my face. (Well, not wet. Evidently you're having some trouble getting it up. Bummer.)

And while we're being open, I've fucked other people too. It was fantastically liberating. I preferred to keep it private, but here I am letting all the Internet know. What does it matter anymore? Somehow your giant head has no space to comprehend empathy.

Well, you chose to go ""slay some pussy"" instead of keeping me in your life. You could have compromised that one night, but you thought I wasn't worth it. I was never worth it, was I? I regret the last full year with you, and that's the god's honest truth. I should have never let you walk all over me, push me down under the pretenses of compromise, time after time.

Funny thing is, I know I really am worth it. I used to think differently, since past experiences with you have been very disempowering. (Here's another secret, one I've never shared with a single soul: after a few attempts on different occasions, I forced myself to vomit up my lunch... I'll never do that again.) I know for a fact that I was always worth an effort, and I will be worth it for the next guy in my life.

You're self-righteous. You're a self-righteous, pig-headed manchild. You're painfully inconsiderate, and I wish you could know how damaging that really was. It's such a shame, because at some point there was a loving heart in your body. Now, your word is dirt to me.

Finally, I was able to say goodbye to my doubt. I could confidently say I was ready to be yours, forever. No more second guesses. I knew we'd make it work. I wanted to show you the last letter I wrote so you could see how serious I was. I went to find it, and then I woke up. 

I was fine for a second, and then I remembered what I had just dreamed about. I said out loud, ""Oh fuck."" and the pain just hit me like a fucking cinder block. It felt so real. I was so ready. And I threw that all away. You didn't really break up with her. You don't really miss me. And I didn't even get to kiss you.

The way I feel about you, Michael, I feel like you are my lifeline. I feel like without you I would be nothing, without you I would be still trying to kill myself. I feel like without you, I would end up somewhere drunk and on drugs, or in jail.

Ever since I met you I knew I would love you. I know I love you because I don't wanna kill myself anymore, for we wouldn't be able to be together. I don't wanna kill myself anymore because I knew you love me and you'd miss me. I wanna be next to you all the time and your name makes me smile. I think your personality is the fucking best. I love everything about your appearance that you hate. I love your freckles, shoulders and back and all. I love the texture and color of your hair, because it's fucking beautiful. I love how you pick on me because i'm short, or because I have tiny hands. I love how you worry about me, you do it like nobody ever has(which they haven't). You make me feel important and loved. I have never been this happy since I was a blissfully-ignorant 5 year old.

Although I am such a fucking gigantic ray of sunshine, I still have my insecurities. Like when you told me that you were just trying to be a good friend, and you weren't trying to cross any lines. Or when you told me that you probably only cared because I was the nicest person that you'd met in years. Or how i'm probably not what you fully want because i'm not fully Caucasian.

You saved my life, literally. Without you, i'd surely still be severely depressed, and I love you for accepting me as I am.

You walked into my life at a weird time. We first met on accident. I was studying for a final, and so were you. I thought you were cute, and then I didn't see you again for a long time. You moved to L.A. to pursue acting.

One random, regular, fateful day changed things. You were skyping my friend in class, and I started talking to you. And we hit it off. I immediately knew you were different and special, and I liked it.

We talked a lot, but I was reserved;  you were in California, and I didn't want to fall for someone that would be so hard to see. I'm too damn logical for my own good.

I loved talking to you, but because of my own insecurities things never really moved anywhere. Empty talk about a spring break road trip happened, but I still enjoyed your different take on everything, and I loved your sense of humor.

We started talking more over the summer. It started off innocently enough. I was busy with summer school, and you were busy in California. But we talked a lot. We bonded. We hungout almost every night. You got me addicted to Doctor Who. I fell for you.

Every morning when I woke up, I had a longing feeling. That feeling you get when you're genuinely happy. Everyday we woke up to texts from eachother. We talked 24/7. We started calling eachother dearie and love. And I was blissful. Nothing could bring me down.

But something did. You were supposed to visit friends and family at the end of summer, but it didn't happen. I built it up soo much in my head, all the anticipation of meeting you, touching you, and holding you... when you told me you couldn't make it, my heart broke.

School started, and we were both busy. We never made it out to see each other sadly. And I stopped talking to you. Not because I was too busy, but because my logical ineptitude told me I should be dating people around college that I could see regularly. So I stopped responding as often. We stopped hanging out. And slowly we drifted apart.

As it turns out I never dated anyone. (Karma's a bitch)  We talked every now and then, but it never was the same. We tried a hangout, but it was just weird... we weren't the same.

I drunk texted you, apologizing for being a jerk because I realized how big of a mistake I made, and that probably just made things weirder. I didn't want things to be weirder... I just wanted you to know that I still had feelings for you. You made me immeasurably happy, and I hadn't felt that in a long, long time.

We started talking a few weeks ago while I was on vacation, and It felt like it did last summer. Two best friends just talking about whatever's on their mind. And it felt right. That deep longing feeling came back. And now I can't get anything back from you.

I deserve it, so It's okay.

You're intelligent, funny, geeky, sexy, nice, and caring. You love loving things. You're not afraid to be passionate. And I miss it...

I don't know what the point of this was. I just wanted to get it off my chest. I still like you even though I haven't seen you in over a year. I want to see you again, and apologize to you in person about how sorry I am, and how selfishly I acted. And most importantly, I want to give whatever this is a chance...

You know I am hoplessly, irrevocably in love with you and you don't do what's right for me. You won't let me move on because you can't face the guilt. You just keep me around because it's good to have that safety net; that someone that would do anything for you without hesitating. 

Well, enough. It's time I put myself first. Try and win back the person that I used to be before you existed in my universe. I used to be so brilliant, so well rounded. So many things that dwindled when you came around to blindfold me into thinking nothing but you mattered.

I would do anything for you, as cliche as that sounds. But I am terribly alone in this. I don't and won't have you. I own nothing of you other than my own memories. I own nothing other than the hundreds of verses I have written in your honor, that wither in a notebook waiting to be heard. But that day will never come, because you will never know. I will not confess that I am so in love with you it's tearing away at me. 

I need to let you go. I can put it off all I want, like I have for the past two years, but it's futile to pretend things will ever change. I am not on your radar. I am only your toy. 

I wish you could just see through my eyes and see the pain I fight so hard to mask. How much I have to work at feigning a smile to keep others from bringing you up. All my convoluted lies about how you are just a friend. How much I bite my tongue around you so things don't go out of hand.

I should have never come back. I should have left well enough alone and wallow in how I would never know how you are again. I don't see how something that has come so easy in the past can be so hard now. Why can't I shove you to the back of my head and pretend you were a dream? Why do I convince myself that I can't do better than you when you care so little for me?

I have to force myself to forget you and if it takes me forever I will. I need to exorcise you from my heart. I need to burn everything I know and burn the ashes.

I found a quote which explains exactly how I feel about you. Guess where it's from? Doctor Who, of course. Funny, huh? I guess it's pretty fitting of me that the most emotional and profound words that I could use to show my innermost feelings would come from a science fiction show, instead of a Shakespeare play or a classic novel. 

“You know when sometimes you meet someone so beautiful and then you actually talk to them and five minutes later they’re as dull as a brick? Then there’s other people, when you meet them you think, “Not bad. They’re okay.” And then you get to know them and… and their face just sort of becomes them. Like their personality’s written all over it. And they just turn into something so beautiful. Rory is the most beautiful man I’ve ever met.”

Replace the name Rory with Aidan, and that's it. That's why I love you. 

When I first saw you in school, I didn't think much. You were the boy with the long hair. You went to my primary school. That was it. Then I spoke to you, and you were still all of those things, but you were a lovely person, too. 

I had a crush on your friend, remember? When we were really good friends, I asked you for advice on how to approach him. It's only now that you've told me you loved me back then that I know that upset you. The girl you had a crush on asked for advice on chatting up your friend -that must've hurt. You still told me that your friend liked me back. You still told me how to approach him, to make me happy. 

I never went ahead and asked out your friend. Something was telling me not to.

When I scored the lead in the school musical, you came to see me. We hadn't even hung out yet. You sat in the front row grinning when I was singing that love song, and I felt this sudden rush and the song became a hopeful one instead of a sad one. It's cheesy, I know, but I remember catching your eye as I began to sing the most cheesy romantic line. I realised, oh shit, I think I just fell in love with Aidan Dawnley.

We went to the cinema the week after as friends. The rest was history. 

We looked a right pair - you had long hair, skinny as a rake. I was the younger theatre geek. To be perfectly honest, I know that none of my friends thought we'd last. I remember one said to me, 'but Rach... he has longer hair than you!' 

That was the week that the RE department set up the prayer room. Everyone had to write secret prayers. I'm an athiest, and that was the first ever time I prayed. I wrote down that I loved you for the first time. I wrote down how I hoped you would like being with me and how I hoped we'd go well because you were my first ever boyfriend.

That was 14 months ago, and here we are. Everything has changed. I found out why you were growing your hair. You cut it all off to raise money for kids with cancer, and to make wigs for them. You didn't tell many people, you didn't want anyone to make a fuss. You gave your hair to that hospital because they were the ones who gave you that life saving heart surgery when you were a few weeks old.

You've been the perfect boyfriend, Aidan. You were the first person to call me beautiful. You made me feel worth something when I'd been depressed for so long. You were a gentleman - opening doors, pulling out chairs, surprise presents, and letting me drag you round the girliest shops. I remember when you got me a pokemon game for Valentines Day - you opened a game and caught 3 pokemon, and you named them 'I' 'love' and 'you'. I saved them in a special file.

You've told me that you wanted to be with me for the rest of your life, because you love me so much. You said I was your princess, that I was so precious. You were going to marry me one day, when I was done with uni. I cried so much when I heard that you needed heart surgery. You can't imagine the feeling I got when I got the phone call from your mum, saying that the surgery was 3 hours too long and she had no idea what was happening.

I still love you, Aidan, after 14 months of being your girlfriend. 

Now that your heart is completely fixed, this September, you and I will star in the school musical together as the romantic leads. We fell in love at last year's musical, and this year, we play a couple. Funny, huh?

A year ago, I hated you. You were so fucking obnoxious. I disliked every fibre of your being. I was nice, though. I tried my hardest, but all I could do was stay quiet and lie so that I didn’t slap you in the face.

Three weeks later, you pulled me aside after class and said you were sorry for annoying me. I nodded and you said if we could start all over again. Your name was Matthew. We shook hands. I never did figure out how you realized I didn’t like you. I’m a compulsive liar. I’m good at lying.

I guess that’s why you wanted to be a psychologist. You get humans, I find out a week later, when we started to eat together during lunch.

We’ve been friends for a year now. You are the only person that knows I lie constantly. You are the only person that can calm me down during anxiety attacks. You walk with me home every day. I told you my secrets, one by one, and you told me yours.

(I forgive you for not having more fucked-up secrets than I do.)

Are we going to college together? In San Francisco? Share an apartment, be domestic and be each other’s wingmen? Study and fail together, sleep at 4AM, rant about how our heads hurt and banter with each other?

Then are we going to go around Europe and study history? We’re history nerds. You love the way cultures interacted and spread and travelled. I like the folklore, the wars and the sweet smell of marble, granite, dirt and bricks—architecture. Taste the sweet wines of France and take sips of strong beer from Germany, tour old cathedrals and sit at benches staring at red tulips and freeze our assess off in Sweden?

You’ll probably look for IKEA first, won’t you.

I guess my point is, what did you mean by making me believe that I’ll have you constantly by my side? What did you mean by us walking down the street, musing on how stupid we thought Shakespeare was as you took my wrist and started to massage it, recalling earlier that I was complaining about it?

Shakespeare was a literary genius. Except for the Romeo and Juliet (I liked Hamlet better) — no one falls in love in first sight. I know I didn’t.

I fell in love with you. Did you mean this to happen? I hated you. You know people and now you’ve twisted my reasoning, crumpled it like paper and tossed it in the trash can.

What did you mean by making yourself so close to me — then tried to get closer? Not as a brother, I don’t think so, especially when you answered your phone at 4AM and tried your absolute best to calm me down because I was frenetically panicking about God knows what.

I hope that I won’t be crushed to pieces because I let a deceptively manipulative fucker like you get to me. I was perfectly fine before you waltzed in and figured me out, then let me keep you for a while.

I’d like you to be mine for a longer while. You already have me.

I feel like I've said this to you before, but sometimes I wonder if words truly express how I feel. And sometimes I'm scared that what we have is so perfect and fragile that it is going to break at any moment. 

When I'm with you, I never want to go to bed because I want to get lost at sea in your beautiful blue eyes. And whenever I wake up, you're my sunshine. I want to start my day as soon as my eyes open and trace your face even if it's 3 am just because I want to know what you would say. You hide your grumbling with kisses to get me to shut up and go back to sleep, but I nuzzle you and whisper to you even once you've already fallen back asleep.

I love the way you let me hold your hand even though you hate PDA. I love the way you laugh whenever I spazz out with excitement. I love when you call me sweetheart. I love when you send me adorable country songs. I love when you tell me I'm you're kind of crazy and I feel like I don't have to hide anything.

But let's be honest, you're never going to see this, so why not? I hated our goodbye. It felt wrong. I hate knowing that at some point you're going to stop paying as much attention to me because you feel safe and that's what always happens. I hate wondering and waiting for the day when you decide that you've found someone else--because I know you will. You're so gorgeous and sweet, you won't be alone for long.

Maybe I can blame myself, I bought into what I wanted. I will always love you, I will always want you for my own. But I still can't quite believe what we say. I'm scared. I'm scared because of how much I've let myself feel for you when my rational side is telling me not to.

I hope we can prove me wrong. I hope we can be everything we talk about. I just need to let you know that loving you is the scariest thing I have ever let myself do.

A month later we began sleeping together. Now, 6 months later, we WERE still sleeping together until tonight. I am absolutely positively through as of tonight. 
I really just need to get this off my chest.

We act like a couple. We talk like a couple. We joke around like a couple. We cared for each other like a couple. The ONLY reason we are NOT a couple is because you do not want children, nor to ever get married. It is your god damn birthday, and instead of being thankful that I went out of my way for you, invited our mutual friends out, made sure that everyone could come to an event that YOU suggested we do, only to have you at the last minute bail on everyone. I went out of my way to ensure it would be a surprise, too. I went out of my way on my ONLY day off to ensure you would have fresh cupcakes for the event. I went out of my way planning for you so you could have a day to remember, since none of your other friends could bother to do a nice thing for you on your birthday. And what do I get in return? Not even a god damn message saying you wont be there to attend. 
Granted, yes. You did suggest you would rather not do said activity tonight. You NEVER said you would not be interested in doing other things. You NEVER said you would not be coming. And you NEVER said you would be home, without responding to any of the messages that we ALL send you.

Half way through the night, I am told you have had a conversation with one of my closest friends. You tell her ""Cool gesture, but I don't like cupcakes"", and yet still all of my messages go unresponded. You tell her that (although it is quickly approaching) it is not currently your birthday, and that you have no interest in attending any event. That you have no idea why I, the very same woman that has done nothing but gone out of my way for you since the very beginning, would bother to do such a thing. Oh, and we mustn't forget how you told her how you HATE birthdays, that you despise anything to do with birthdays, and insist on being miserable. God forbid anyone that cares about you would like to make a day just or you, to spend time with you and make it special, and devote an entire week to planning something nice to make you happy, well they can clearly just go to hell in your opinion.

I'm done. I'm so fed up being taken for granted and trying to do nice for you. I'm tired of not being appreciated for what I'm worth. I'm so tired of sitting home waiting for your calls, your responses, or for you to finally show up for a date hours late.
I hope one day you'll see how hurt you've made me. I hope one day you'll understand what its like to be in this position. I've often been caught telling close friends how much of a wonderful husband and father you could be one day because of how caring and thoughtful you are, and any woman would be lucky to have you in their life. After tonight, I take pity on the next who happens to fall under your charm. Clearly, I have had the wrong opinion of you since the very beginning. 

Yet after all this, all I would have asked for would be a simple thank you. Thank you. Two simple words which would have saved any and all of this. You knew this was planned- yet you could not so much text two simple words, or even to call would have been quicker. I suppose it's too much to ask for, and for that, I THANK YOU. I thank you for showing me who exactly, I've been getting involved with.

If you ever do have the courage to speak to me again, I can assure you the three DOZEN homemade cupcakes that are now most likely stale from awaiting your arrival tonight, you will find in places that are the utmost uncomfortable.

I mean, chances are you will never actually read this. Even if you did, you wouldn't know that it's from me.. But I can't stop thinking this over and over in my head. And if I don't write it out, I'm going to explode. So, here goes nothing.. I've basically been in love with you since sophomore year. I know that may seem crazy but I can't find another word that really encompasses everything I'm feeling. From the increased heart beat and sweaty palms to that incredible feeling I get every time I hear you laugh, or see you smile, or just see you really. Especially when you go full banshee Teagan, that brings me more happiness then all the cats on the internet combined. I mean, every time I see you.. I'm right back in Biology again on that first day sitting in my desk. Looking at someone, who was then and is still now, the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Much less been married to, ;). Now I know you don't feel the same way. I don't expect you to reciprocate these feelings, that would be foolish of me. I know you aren't attracted to me in that way, you don't feel that way about me etc. And even if you did, we go to school rather far apart. I mean, you're only here for the holidays. I only am going to get a few more chances to hang out with you for at least another 6 months.. Also, you want to be with a man who believes the same things you do. I know your passionate about your beliefs and I respect you for that. You deserve to find a guy who can be what you need him to be, you deserve everything and more. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I want to. I can't give those things to you. I can't be that man.. Now, call me crazy but I do think there was a short period last year where you may have.. felt the same way? Unfortunately again for me, this was during that brief time where I had finally begun to move on. But seeing you this past week.. Has brought it all back. The butterfly's, the joy.. the crushing feeling of hallowed sorrow.. I know even that may have been just my imagination however. Chalk it up to me misunderstanding just how sweet and kind you are to your friends. Honestly.. that terrifies me more then anything. I don't really expect you to say or do anything about this. Mostly because this is on the internet on a throwaway. But I'm glad I finally got it out.. Maybe now I'll be able to sleep.

I drove with the windows down and wore cut off jeans and more of my skin was open to the air then has been since the last time I saw you here. I was emptying the dishwasher and my hair was still wet from a swim. You came to my door wearing blue and we matched all day, all night, and into the early morning hours. 

It’s October now; Indian Summer, perhaps the last warm day we’ll have for months. 

I played that album today. I was driving a car with a sound system as good as yours and I turned up the bass. When we saw this band you changed your shirt in the middle of the concert floor and folded your polo into a cargo pocket. We danced the whole night and the lump in your pocket ricocheted between us.

I walked to the park tonight. I walked by the fence where I’d examined your face for the scar you were explaining. You flipped over your bike handles when you were a kid. The concrete was stained red with blood that had to be bleached away. The scar was nearly identical to my own, in the fold between your chin and lips. My palms tingled; I’d put my hands on your shoulders to turn your face into the light.
	
I went to the swings tonight. I swung, then shifted back and forth slowly on my toes. I twisted the chains and let my legs whip in a circle. That second night you’d sat beside me reading awful fanfiction off your phone, snorting between lines and wiping tears out of your eyes. The third time I’d asked you if sometimes you didn’t just want to be ignorant of the ability to think more and be more in the world. You said of course ignorance was bliss, but no, you’d rather be miserable than stupid. 
	
I walked home tonight and I used only the left sidewalk. I passed the shadow of the maple leaves splayed on the ground from the streetlights above. I’d stopped you there, the first time, to look at the pattern and we’d stood in silence for some time until I said, life, and you agreed, and we walked on. 

On other days I walked the right sidewalk. I saved the retracing of our steps. You’d taken shorter steps for my shorter legs. I’d brushed your arm with mine. We’d walked diagonal across the intersection because it was always the middle of the night when we came there, two or three or four o clock in the morning. Your dark hair blended into the shadows, glasses catching in the streetlamps, pale hands curved around the edges of your sleeves. The first time you couldn’t decide whether to tuck or untuck your shirt. It was sky blue; it buttoned down. You’d pushed the long sleeves carelessly above your elbows and when you first walked through the door I caught the outline of the muscle in your forearm and watched it all night as it flexed and released each time you stretched a hand to grasp or gesture.
	
I came home tonight. I sat at my desk and I talked to someone else. He is nice. He is cute. He’s at work and you are on vacation, meeting your hero, seeing a play, living your life. He is attentive and close and he always initiates contact first. 
	
He draws. He has a good job. He’s loyal and steady and ready for me. He loves to fix cars and he builds jet engines for a living and he humors my love of baseball.  He says he’d take the garbage out for me. 

He failed high school English. He didn’t go to college. I had to define the word bereft for him. 
	
You are incapable of acknowledging that you are most likely smarter than I am. Your humor goes like lightning from silly to salacious. You smile when I use a particularly beautiful word. I know in your head you’re putting parentheses around it (salacious) like we used to do when we’d talk into the early morning hours from two different states and two different lives and two different crises. You open doors for me because you’re polite and because you know I like it. The only tattoo you’d ever want to get is the symbol of the Deathly Hallows hidden away on your ankle just to say you have it. 
	
And though we’ve made no promises to each other I compare every one to you: the brown belt you always wear and the slightly curved set of your shoulders, the head and a half you have on me and the feeling of burying my nose in your chest. The unconscious pushing up of your glasses with your first and middle finger. The pause you take before you speak of anything serious, making sure to say only what you mean and nothing more. The smile, the real one, that takes up half your face completely unrestrained by your usual decorum. 

The last time we met it was on your ground and you showed me all you could of your favorite place in the world: paintings, architecture, tradition, pride. You told me the history as we walked away the afternoon. I was absorbed by the quantity, arrested by the grace. You watched me. And I felt that smile, your whole body beaming. 

We spent our day together and most of our night and we sang to each other on the car ride to my hotel. It was four in the morning. I hadn’t slept the day before, too excited to get to you. I asked when I’d see you next. I hugged you twice and started counting the days. 

Snow will have fallen by then. I will have led someone even further on. He will flirt with me and I will humor him and feel guilty and continue with the sport that distracts while I’m counting the days.

You will have taken exams and taught classes and entered applications for graduate school and had a few conversations with me that, to my own shame, will have changed the climate of my days.

I will have written things that I am proud of and read things that changed me. I will have spoken to people and taught children and gone to plays and visited friends. I will have fought back anxiety and embraced days that, without expectations, turned miraculous. I will have thought a hundred times that the next time I see you I will not be the first one to walk away, to break eye contact, to let that feeling go before asking what it means. 

I ache after the best version of myself: agile, insightful, infinitely curious. She celebrates the significance of it all; for her the world has weight. But it seems that she travels with you now. 

Won’t you bring her back to me?

What kind of human being instigates a relationship with someone who is away from home and who's wife is 6 months pregnant. Of all the people that you could have found to cheat on your husband with WHY did the only other married one in the group have to be your victim. 
We were having problems and you took advantage of that.What made you think you had the right to make demands on him? to convince him I was a horrible selfish person who didn't care about him? You ruined my pregnancy. He was confused and scared of the future and rather then break off your relationship when you saw it wasn't going as planed you lead him on thinking he still had a chance with you.. thinking i was still bad. He brought me to a lawyer fresh out of the hospital to appease you.
It was too late... you had found someone else but just like with your husband you didn't have the guts to tell the person that it was over. You waited until that extra month of damage could be done. waited until AFTER our child was born 

I think about you all the time, think about you touching him YOU HAD NO RIGHT. I compare myself to you and usually come up short even though you are nothing special to look at. I creep your facebook to see if you're in any new relationships or to see if you've gotten fat. the latter would appease me more

You contacted him when your new boytoy fell through and he told you it wasn't happening. how did that make you feel? You think he is going to fall for your tricks again? yea sure hang out as friends you fucking slut. 

You caused damage to my relationship that months later I still don't know is repairable. Its like PTSD where I will be feeling find and then WHOSH there you are ... im seeing my phone bill when i got the first one not understanding why it was so high.. whos number was that. i see my husband touching your body where I am insecure. i hear the hurtful things he said to me when he thought you understood. I see him holding our child for the first time not wearing his wedding ring. i see the gap we kept between us in our bed for months because of you. i hear myself telling him to leave and never come back. i see him driving away because you had a fight and he didn't want to loose both of us.

 i imagine your husbands rage at finding out about your affair and I smile seeing him beat you. One of my regrets is not driving out to your home and doing it myself. I am not proud of myself when I enjoy these.. as much as I hate you.

That's not to say that I am introverted, because I love the company of others.

But when I have have an idea, I think about what it can do to a person because I tell them and often, it is enough to make me want to shut up.

So I consulted in the past psychologists, but they cost a lot and if all you want to do is vent a little, then they are useless.

To make it worse, because I do overthink everything, by the time I do see a shrink, there are no options left that I haven't tried and they admit that they cannot help me.

My last one even refused payment for my last session, saying he was tired to feel useless.

But he wasn't. I was able to express myself without thinking of the consequences of what I was saying.

I didn't have to save anyone's feelings. 

So, instead, I wrote.

It's not new. I wrote thousands of short stories and even published a few, most on the Internet for free anonymously, a few in magazines for small token amounts of money, and one on my own blog.

Most of them are just too personal and mix fiction and reality because, what's the point of writing about reality if no one is going to read it?

Instead, I twist reality around and make it more interesting than my pathetic life.

But it's not as therapeutic as I would have hoped, because it's an escape from reality. It's a lie.

And then, one day, I discovered /r/UnsentLetters.

Unlike IAMA, you don't have to spill your whole life, you write to get something off your chest as if you were writing to the person.

But you are not silent in your corner. There are other readers, and some leave comments.

Not 2689 comments, half of which are skeptical and half of those are downright insulting.

No, 1 to 5 comments, all of which supportive. All of which are there to pat your back and tell you: ""We feel your pain. We feel your joy. We are there for you bro, thanks for sharing"".

And so, I am writing this to say: ""Thank you for listening"". 


""Thank you for being there"".

""Thank you for being you"".

I guess I broke the rules, in a way, because this actually is a sent letter. But I thought it was appropriate.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVvjXJentik

This song feels like today.

I like songs like this. It sounds like the crying of metal. 

It's hard for me to listen to music and not feel inundated by strong, overwhelming imagery. Is it like this for you? I suspect that it's not. 

I think of a fever red sun rising despondently over  burned out, long dead industrial graveyards.

I think of the groaning of defeated steel, collapsing with no resistance, against the cold blue brine of the salty ocean, a drowning ship, singing out it's last melancholies, it's defeat, it's testament to the inevitable failures and mournings of mankind as it fades from reach forever. 

I think of boneyards of man in the days after man is no more, interlaced with fields of ash, and all that they've ever known is lost.

You play your music, I think, and you have chords and progressions and lilts and crescendos crashing through you with wild brilliance, with unencumbered vibrance, and you're so different then me; I just stare vacantly into my sad and everlasting flashes of hopelessness while you vibrate with life.

I can't ever love you. I don't understand your fascination with me. It makes me think you are childish. It makes me think you're naive. 

You look at me with those unearthly green eyes, and so often I see concern, commingled with confusion. Someone with half a lifetime should know that he should trust those flashes of clarity, but you...I watch the heroic battle that your optimism fights against those unsightly hints at reality, and you wash the worry away and pretend like it's all going to be ok, and that what I've just said or done is reasonable, and that you can make sense of this wrecking ball of miserly discontent beside you.

I fade out, and you force yourself back in.

You cry out your declarations of adoration. I tell you to stop, and you just can't abide my warnings. I found it charming, but now, I just think it's painful.

Stop. You can't possibly ""love"" me; the notion is absurd. You don't know me, you don't know me at all. You love an idea, a potential, a possibility. Your reverence for me is misguided. I am not your modern angel. I am a fucked up abyss of all that is rancid and deceptive and incurable. You only know the face on the outside that's a thin veneer above the teeming mass of putrefaction inside of me. 

I will never love you. Your devotion to simplicity exhausts me. Your boundless optimism bores me. 

I admire you, I respect you, and I delight in all that you are that I could never be,

and I wanted to tell you right then that I can never feel for you how you feel for me, and I built it up, and my heart was burning, because I can't bear to cause you pain, because I don't want to kill that sparkling, optimistic, hopeful, pure, and untarnished spirit, but I can't stand you telling me you ""love"" me one more time because the inauthenticity of it all is like a malice in my guts,

and I was ready, and I was going to cry it all out to you,

and then the connection was lost.

But it's here.

I know that you are about to hurt so badly, and you're sleeping peacefully, imagining that you love some girl who you imagine is real.

I know that what you know is not real...you haven't even met me. I know that you're going to be hurt by this impending severance, and I can't sleep about it. 

Soon, you'll know I could never, will never, and have never loved you.

I'm sorry.

It was a light stalking, of the internet variety, but there it is. I mostly used the knowledge I blundered my way upon to avoid you, so hopefully any inkling you may have had was far short of fears that I was gonna make a shrine of your nail clippings or skin you and wear you as a suit or something. I wasn't. Seriously, a human suit would just be redundant, not to mention of a material far inferior to other suits, so that was never the plan.

 (I know. I'm not funny. I know.)

when I go back all those months ago to the root of it, I just really liked you. I wish that could justify all the unfortunate events that occurred thereafter, but I've long since given up at plots of explanation and settled into the usual strategy of complete and utter avoidance.

Simple truth is you've occupied my thoughts for a long time. Pretty much since I first met you. You know that scene in the godfather where Al Pacino looks at the Sicilian girl and she makes a face like he just stabbed her in the gut? well, I guess that's how it felt. Pathetic or crazy or whatever they call it, from then on I couldn't shake you. That's changing, slowly I'm letting go of my delusions. After all, I don't know you. I don't know if you're worthy of a letter all to yourself when there are real people in my life I love like the dickens, people I should be writing this about. But you've occupied far too much of my free thinking time to be ignored, so lets just dive in.

It was the little things. The way you would half smile got me for a really long time. Someone would be laughing at something and I'd catch myself picturing it. Your ever so slightly balding hair, loved it. Sorry I pulled it that one time. The way you smell..ai...well, its very nice. To a girl used to the cigarettes and cheap beer cologne, it was a good change. You were smart, put together; you were funny, and it's hard to make me laugh. I made a point to memorize your face the second time I saw you, because the first encounter was the first time in awhile I had wanted to take a chance on anything, and it was to know you.

Not just fuck you, as I tried so painfully hard to convince myself of.

I don't know where all those little things went wrong. I could detail the events, try to explain my side and try to assuage the many doubts of my sanity you and most this town have, but alas, I really am completely out of my damned mind. Such an attempt would be me muttering to myself in the dark hours of the morning, instead of saying the things that need saying.

So on to the apologies. I'm sorry about all the drinking. I'm sorry about the brashness and the black outs, I'm sorry I was too big of a coward to stop trying to show off and just treat you like a human being. At the time I felt so out of my league, I guess I couldn't help it. I'm sorry if I freaked you out, and I'm sorry I was a walking stereotype of everything that's wrong with my gender. I'm sorry about the awkward nickname, the stupid texts, I'm sorry about this stupid irrelevant letter. I'm sorry I can't talk to you, it's just the mix of my embarrassment and (albeit diminishing, it really has been a long time) shame surrounding you creates a feeling strongly akin to vomiting up all my innards.

These are apologies for you, and all the others who I was careless with. It was only when they finally cut me out of their lives that they saw me for what I really was--fucking afraid. Afraid of everything. Laying thick the amoral bitch front on top of a tangle of insecurities that I thought weaknesses, though in retrospect they were the very truest and best things about me.

There was a night where in passing we talked about love. If a drug could simulate love then how real can love be? well, as usual, I lied. Love, destiny, purpose, I did believe. They're just too good of ideas to not try and imitate, to not spend at least a little bit of your life searching and yearning for. Six months later and a lot has happened, I don't much see the credence in lying to oneself anymore, but I don't know if I could let myself apologize for trying. And with you it felt like that movie love. The kind that lights everything up and absorbs you completely in the very idea of itself, then disappears into a credit roll never to be seen again.

Despite what little it was, that is what it felt like. And if you happen to find this in your stumblings through the void, and I get made, just know that for a small period of time you made a girl literally crazy over you. Confidence booster, amiright?

Also I am no longer expending my bandwidth on your various social medias.

 Also, I didn't take that vikodin. I was just ashamed that I didn't have enough connects to get you some apology drugs. Haha, what a stupid fucking thing to be embarrassed about.

We are taught in our society to act a certain way. To get a job, to get married, to be independent. But we have to do that all without showing emotion or asking for help. 

So when I'm not talking to you. It's not because I don't like you or I don't want you. It's kind of the opposite. Being attracted to you physically, just makes me nervous mentally. I don't want to come off as a creep because then you'll never even bother being in the same room as me. I don't want to come off as a nice guy or a gentleman because I don't think women think that's sexy. I don't want to come off as desperate because I feel like women can sense desperation. All of these pre-conceived notions, whether they are actually true or not, makes me never want to talk to woman in my life. I'm crazy I know. but it's what goes in my mind all the time I'm sitting next to a girl I really like.

The sad thing is I don't really know you. I'm too busy wondering what you think of me that I don't even realize what you favorite ice cream flavor is. What your mother's maiden name is. Why Sally and you aren't friends anymore.  

At the beginning of this letter I said how it's mostly my fault why I got friendzoned or we stopped talking. In truth it's all my fault. How would you know, I wonder these kinds of things, that I am not a creep or a stalker. That I build you up in my head and have these unrealistic expectations that no one, not even my mom, can fill.

I truly am. You are everything to me, and we toss each other around like we're disposable. We sometimes use one another, even though we both know the bond that we share. We're both too scared to delve too deep in our relationship, in our emotions, because all too often that's where we get lost. But we always end up back together, no matter how superficial. 

I love you, but I'm scared. I've lost my house, a majority of my friends, but the feeling of losing you too seems unbearable. It brings on those awful anxiety attacks that frighten me. You've been the only person I've known to be able to quiet them.

Neither of us are looking to be in a relationship at this point in our lives. You go about it how you do, I go about it how I do. Over the last month, when I finally allowed myself to allow you into my life beyond the poker games we both go to, I thought it was clear between us that romantic and intimate emotions between us were not on the agenda for either of us. It has been a blast just having a mate I could be myself around and be comfortable with sharing thoughts opinions while having a few quiet ones, and some not so quiet ones. silly times and serious times. You know it has been a long while since I have been able to be that way with anyone due to past whatevers. I really value the connection we have as mates. So... what was up with last night. Mates don't whisper in someone ear like you did. Mates dont hold someone the way you held me last night. It isn't ok. You can't just say and both agree that these things are off limits and then just do something like that. I need you to be my buddy. We have fun, no? We understand each other, no? So why do this?  And why make me yearn to be back at last night? Why make me wish I had of let you kiss me instead of getting up and shaking it off? This can't happen. We would never get to go back.

I'm sorry I didn't write this earlier. The last version I wrote wasn't very good, a consequence of writing while stoned. I ended up deleting it, and I regret that quite often. I'm just going to come right out with it.

I love you.

I don't think we'll ever be truly content. Sure we will be content at times, but we will never be content all the time. The world is a cold place and I know you know that. But that's okay too. Because people like us, our job isn't to settle into a place. Our job is to change the world. To take the leap. To run the gauntlet and come out better for it. We're the people who run the world, and we have to take that great power and make the world better for it. I know it will be hard, and I know you will know that. And that's why I love you; because, just like me, you're ready to make that climb. You're ready to lead that revolution. You want a better tomorrow. 

I love you because I know you don't love me. And I don't love you. But what I do love is what you could be, and you love me for the same reason. We love each other because we both know that we can be better, that the world can be a better place. I know you get it. I know you can see it too, that beautiful vision of a better tomorrow. A vision that's worth fighting for. A vision worth dieing for. A vision worth loving for. 

I love you because I know you don't love me, you love that dream, and you're going to chase that dream until your heart stops dead. 

Of course, I know you'll never read this. Or at least, I think you'll never read this.

You'll never read this because I don't really think you exist. I think you might just be a figment of my imagination, a part of this vision of a better world. I've never met anybody like you because I've never met anybody like me, and some days that really scares me.

But I might be wrong about that too. Sometimes, I think, just maybe, everybody is like us, and we just put on a charade because change is scary, and the people making the world worse are very powerful. I'm as bad as everyone else, doing what I must to blend in, keeping my true self masked. It's safer that way.

But every now and then, I catch a glimpse. A joke here. A smile there. An unorthodox reaction or a wise saying. And in those moments, I know that there are others out there like us. Everyday soldiers, working in silence and subversion, quietly ushering in a better world. That must be our war, our religion, and our path. Our army will come from all walks of life because we improve all walks of life. 

This is why I know the world will one day be perfect. Not in my life time, but someday. Our people will fight and continue to fight, while still maintaining the charade. A phantom force fixing the world, one mind at a time, discreetly moving to pull the carpet out from under everything that is evil and wrong. But until that day, we have to maintain the charade, we have to protect ourselves, we have to do wrong. But we must never forget right from wrong, and we must never forget that the evil is just a mask, a terrible mask we wear in the name of a better tomorrow, the vision that I know you so desperately want.

And that is why I fear I will never meet you. I may never see you without the mask, and even worse, you may never see me without mine. We could pass each other in the street and never know. And honestly, I'm okay with that. And I know you are too. Because we don't need each other. We know that this path, this vision, requires subtly. Requires discretion. Us meeting may have to be a sacrifice we have to make for the greater good, and I'm okay with that, in the name of ensuring that someday, in the far future, people won't have to make that sacrifice, people can just be themselves, flaws and all, and be loved for it. 

But I hope I'm wrong. Because I know that you find this road lonely. I do too, so I was hoping that maybe we could walk together.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1fp9ce,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1fp9ce/a_love_letter/,

Even though we arn't together any more, even though it's been seven very long years, I still love you as much as I did when we were together. Nothing in the history of my life has ever been so wonderful as the time that we spent together. 

When I tried to message you a few years ago, I was so afraid that I rushed things, I didn't explain myself well. When I said that I removed you from my friends list because I couldn't stand to see you happy, that isn't all of it. Seeing you happy without me, it hurt me. I was told that I needed to remove you from my list by the girl I was seeing, so I did, and I didn't have the courage to tell you myself. 

I was afraid of what you would say to me if I told you. Then you found out from said girl that I had removed you, and if that hurt you I am so sorry. Though it hurt me to see you happy, I never wanted you to be any other way. You, between the two of us, deserve to be happy.

I'm also sorry that I never told you how proud I was of you. You showed more courage by moving there than anyone I have ever known. I admire you for it, and to this day I can hold it up as an example of a kind of bravery that I don't know that I will ever possess.

I know that our seperation was mutual, that we didn't want to keep torturing ourselves with the distance. This was the biggest mistake of my life, you were able to move on, to find someone new and now your married with a beautiful daughter. I tried so hard to move on from you, but truely I just cannot. 

When I close my eyes I can still feel your heartbeat against my chest. I can still hear your laugh, I can feel your lips against mine. It kills me that I took what I had for granted, that I didn't fight for you. I push myself to exhaustion so I don't have to dream of you, dream of the things I lost. 

I still remember our first real date in the park near our college. I remember proposing to you with a ring from a bubble machine because you taught me it was the sentiment that counts. I still remember you on the bridge outside the art center when I asked you that question in the falling snow. You made me so happy, and I will never forget that. 

You made me want to be a better person, and taught me to look at myself in a way I never had before. You believed in me, something I wasn't even able to do myself. My life, my writing, my very existance, was bettered by your love. Nothing I could ever do would be enough to repay you for that. 

I still wear the ring you gave me on a chain around my neck. It's the last thing that I have left of us, to remind me of a time when I was complete, of when I was truely happy. I have never known a joy like that since, and honestly I don't believe I will again.

If you were to show up at my door tomorrow I would drop everything to be with you again. However, I send this because you deserve to know, not in any hopes of ending up together with you again. You have a life now, and I understand that. I do want to be friends again, my life was so much better when I could call you my friend. I want to be able to be there for you if you need someone to talk to. 

I am writing this, but I know I will never have the courage to send it to you. Just know that I will love you until the end of my days, and if there is a world beyond this one, I will love you there as well.

These are some of the things I've always wanted to say to you, but you never seemed too keen to hear. That's understandable, I suppose.


Remember when I was little and I said that I was raped? Then I took it back and said I was lying? Why didn't you investigate it further? I was nine. Nine year olds don't make that shit up. You know it, I know it. The reason I said it was rape is because I didn't understand the difference between rape and molestation at nine. You were suspicious and confrontational right away. So I got too scared to tell you who it really was and lied about that. Instead of trying to figure out what happened, you basically called me a liar and said you were taking me to the hospital where they could tell you I was lying. So I panicked and just said I made the whole thing up. You realize he's assaulted other little girls, after me, right? I went to you as a child, your child, in a time of great need and you dismissed me, coldly.

When K2's dad found out what Curtis was doing to me and Kama and made me tell Dad, he believed me right away, but I remember you on the phone telling Dad to be sure we weren't lying before taking us to the police. Both K and I ages 9 and 11 were lying? So were K2 and K3? But, just so you know, I did lie. He didn't only molest me and force me to give him head, he raped me. I was too scared to say then... But I don't think you would have responded well, anyway.


C told you about Ellis way before I did. I think you thought she was lying too. When I told you what he was doing to me, you told me not to tell anyone until you talked to him. You know he continued to abuse me the whole time it took you to ""talk to him about it""? Do you know what that meant? He stuck his fingers inside of my vagina and asshole and groped my undeveloped chest while I slept, spied on me in the bathroom, and masturbated right next to me. And you knew. You knew the whole time and did nothing. I asked again if I could tell on him yet and you said no. Only when he did it again and I told C and she told R and Ellis was so ganged up on that he finally confessed did you let me turn him in. Even then you seemed angry about it. So, it's okay for him to molest your daughters until he confesses? Why?


When I was 16 I told you I was dating a 32 year old man and was addicted to meth (this part's for you guys not in the letter: I've broken up with the 32 year old and I'll be clean two years may 13th). You didn't believe me. I only weighed 100 lbs at the time (and I'm 5'7 for you guys again).



When I reported Kalvin, Robert, and Pride in the mental ward when I was 17, you didn't seem supportive and, once again, thought I was lying until two other victims came forward for Kalvin, Robert was already suspected of pedophilia by family members, and Pride was already a registered sex offender who focused on teenage girls.

And now, I've been assaulted again and you don't believe me, again. Because I always try to ruin K's relationships with false assault claims? (sarcasm (that part is in the letter)). Seriously, I've known him for five years, been close for two, why would I randomly make this up now? Just to send my baby sister into a depression and ruin the life of a boy I considered to be my baby brother?



My entire life you've chosen the men who sexually assaulted me over me, your daughter. You've done your best to call me a liar, cover it up, and ignore it. Do you have any idea how much this fucked with my head? How much resentment it built? You say you love me, but you don't. You can't if you're willing to let people sexually assault me and shame me when I come forward. You love the men who raped and molested me more, at least that's what your actions say. You never even called this time to see what happened or show concern for me.



I'm more depressed and alone than I have ever been in my entire life. Dad is literally the only person I have left. I think about suicide every day, but I'm too much of a coward to ever go through with it and besides that I'm working at getting myself healthy and better.



I'm moving as soon as the lease ends at my place and I'm not giving you the address or going back to [my county] again. I'm done. You guys can have the dude that assaults people in their sleep. Even if you guys eventually decided I wasn't lying, I don't think I can be around people who think I make up false sexual assault claims. I mean, really? If this happened to you, if all of what happened to me, happened to you and no one wanted to save you and called you a liar every time and you got no hugs, no I'm sorry this happened to you, but a lot of ""you're over reacting"" ""just get over it"" and ""it didn't happen anyway"" what would you do? How would you feel? It's no fucking wonder I'm so fucked up and was such a shitty teen.


I don't understand your choices as a mother or a person. And all of this comes from the woman who ""hates"" sex offenders. But only when they sex offend someone other than your daughters, then they're great people who just made a tiny little oopsies, but no one was really hurt, or they're totally innocent men and you just have daughters who like to make false sexual assault claims for fun. I can't wrap my head around your thought process at all. If I had a nine year old that had told me she was raped, I would take her to the fucking hospital or a therapist and assure her she was safe and believed until I got to the bottom of it. You... didn't.


I don't really know how to end this, other than to say ""Goodbye, mom. I really do love you. I'm sorry about all the issues we have and the distance that's always been there ever since I found out you weren't the angel I thought you were at nine. I'm sorry for being such a hard teen. And I really do hope you have a great life.""

There are so many reasons you can’t die. I couldn’t even begin listing them all, but I have to do something and you are half way around the world, so it’s not like I can just hop in my car and drive to the hospital and sit by your side with Millie and your parents and your sister. I don’t belong there, as much as it hurts to say it.

I think I fell in love with you the first time I met you and I can’t even remember when that was. My first really clear memory about you is from a few weeks or a few months before I got to go to my first SOLAR event. I remember we used to LARP in Hickory by the airport. V:tM and Werewolf, and sometimes I got to play a Changeling because I was the kid sister.

I remember Channie and I got into a heated argument because we were both moonstruck madly in love with you. We argued over who could have you, and Channie, citing Werewolf like the geeks we were proclaimed she had rank and status. She and I didn’t speak again much until we were all driving down to SOLAR and she made that comic about it. I still have it…somewhere.

I remember you breaking both of our hearts when you instantly fell for the Twins at that event. I remember giving you my bed, because the cabin didn’t have enough beds and I was too wired to sleep. I kept seeing spiders in the dark, but I didn’t want you to see me scared.  

When I think about our friendship it is a lot of disjointed memories,  punctuated with the feeling of longing because I nursed my crush on your for at least eight years before finally letting go. It’s a blaze of VampCat and Knightmare. William’s basement and sitting behind you, rubbing your back while you rolled dice for me. 

The craziness of the Mutants and Masterminds game. I remember Chris Poe, he is the only one of your characters I can remember in any sense of detail. It makes me sad to think about that because that means I’m missing so much.  I do remember you trying to run your own game, Demon the Fallen and I was really unsure how to play World of Darkness on table-top rather than as a LARP, but it was really fun none the less.

Then I remember you being gone. You moved in with Millie again and then you got married and then you joined the army and you became this person that I used to know.  I ignored the message you sent me on face book when I invited you to my wedding because I saw it just as I was leaving for work that day and I forgot about it.

I didn’t realize how much I miss you. My brain didn’t connect yesterday when Alex told me that you’d been hurt and you were being air lifted  away. I was sick and I just went on with my life, but it was eating at me. And then Alex’s message on my phone to call him, even if I was still at work. My stomach dropped through the floor. 

I put off calling him for another half hour because I wasn’t sure if I could make it knowing how bad you might be doing. But not knowing is a lot worse. Yes, I stood in the middle of the back room at work crying because of the words ‘no neurological activity’ and some part of me already thinks of you in the past tense. A person who was, not a person who is.

I start tearing up every time someone asks me if I am okay. I am not okay. I am not going to be okay.  It is this horrible hole in my chest knowing that you will die. I have known and loved you for a lifetime already, and I am not ready for you to not be in the world anymore.

So you’re not allowed to die. I am completely, selfishly commanding you to cut that shit out, wake your brain up, and get better. Because I don’t know what to do in a world where my friends can die.

I'm embarrassed and angry and ashamed to admit that after you cheated I stayed in our relationship because I was not strong enough to get out and afraid of being on my own. I didn't want to be lonely. In hindsight I can see that staying with you and hoping to make things better ended up contributing to the loneliness. 

I let my anger and insecurities change me into someone I'm not. I couldn't always see it happening but during the times when I could I wasn't able to cut off contact. It ended up being you who stopped talking to me when it should have been the other way around.

And here I am still able to think about you as the better person that I know you are. I'm angry that I still miss you sometimes. I shouldn't. I hate that I hope one day you'll come back and things will fall into place. Does that make me weak? I don't want to be dismissed and forgotten so easily, or feel that somehow I wasn't good enough for you when you were the one to mess up so badly. 

I don't feel angry towards you as often as I used to. Sometimes you have to make the shittiest mistakes to learn the biggest lessons.

At her side was a half bottle of wine, ibuprofen, and a phone. She had suffocated to death. 

She wasn't found until nearly a week later, but was well preserved in the winter-cold air in her unheated home. There was no bloating, or visible decay. The medical examiner said she had emphysema, and died as a result. She hadn't told anyone -- although her medical records indicated she knew.

She survived being hit by a car, fracturing her skull. She survived having her car crushed by a school bus. And yet, it was suffocation that got her in the end. 

She remembered the Japanese interment camps in Portland, OR -- when her friend was taken. She was an activist during the 1960s and 1970s directing medical treatment of injured protesters. She was a lifelong artist. She spent her later years working with the mentally infirm, helping many to become independent in their lives and leave care, become gainfully employed, and in some cases even become married -- much to the chagrin of her bosses. 

I loved her like family. She was one of a few people, if not the only one, with whom I had shared my thoughts unfiltered. She heard me without judgement, and spoke freely and frankly. She understood me like no other did. When others saw a misfit troublemaker who refused to go to school, she saw independence and intelligence. As corny as it is, she believed in me when I could not.

It hurts so bad that you died the way you did. I'm so sorry Susie. I wish I could have helped you. I wish I would have known. I wish you hadn't suffered so. It was a cruel death that such a kind and caring soul did not deserve.

I refuse to let myself be numb to your death, like I have with so much else in my life. I will grieve you proper, and continue to show you that I was worth your attention.

You seemed to believe that this life was not the only one we lived. While I don't believe it myself, if such a thing was true then surely you would be one deserving of moving to the next step in life. I can now understand why people cling to things like the afterlife, because it's so difficult to let people go.

I will cherish the art you gave me until the day that I too die.

I love you. I'll miss you. Thank you so much for showing me how to be a human being again. Thank you affecting me so much that I weep openly for you.

I pumped into your on the Pelham inbound.  You were reading a book on muscles and turned out to be a masseuse and yoga instructor. I somehow impressed you on the subway with the few words in Japanese I somehow know.

I am writing to apologize for blowing you off after the cool and brief moment we had talking. I wanted to get your email, your number, your anything. But I didn't have the balls to do so and I am sorry about that. You were really cool and beautiful and I dropped the ball. It's been years and I still kind of feel back for what didn't happen.

If I could go back in time and never meet you, I would do it in a heart beat. That day, my birthday, that you and your friend started talking to me on the bus, would go so differently. Because it was Halloween, your friend was dressed up like one of my favorite cartoon characters. I wanted to take a picture for my good friend F, who loves that show too. I asked you to take the picture. I thought nothing of it at first. 

Then when I saw you again in the dining hall, I figured it was fate, or some stupid notion like that. I sat down at your table, where you were alone. We talked, and ended up exchanging numbers. I felt high. I had successfully pulled off a conversation with a guy and he hadn’t hurt me or ridiculed me. 

Then, that night, you asked me, spur-of-the-moment, to go to the ballroom dancing club’s meeting. We danced, and I started to doubt myself. Then, another night, we met and talked for a few hours. I opened up and let you in a little more than I would anyone normally. I doubted more, but I told myself it was fine. We held hands, and it felt weird, it felt wrong. My hand didn’t fit in yours, and it was uncomfortable. After you left on the bus and I went to my dorm room, I felt exposed and in danger of being wounded, so I closed back up as soon as you texted me again.

I hated your texts, even as they made me feel like gold. They were like mini-emails, and that’s irritating. You told me how beautiful you thought I was, and how you felt a connection to me. I didn’t believe it. I knew you were sincere, but I think you were blinded by the same light I was: being paid attention to by someone for the first time. I knew you were wrong, but you thought you were right.

Then I visited your dorm and met your roommate, K. He’s a really stellar guy, by the way. I’ll miss his friendship. I’ll be honest; I hated the smell, and it was so messy I thought I’d suffocate. I’m not even a neat freak, but that amount of mess turned me off. You walked me to the bus; we held hands, and I leaned against you. I went back to my university while you stayed at yours.

Then the shit hit the fan for me. I ignored your texts and calls for two days. This wasn’t just for you; don’t go thinking you’re special or anything. I dropped off the grid and didn’t talk to anyone on my phone, texting or the internet. Then, on Friday night, you tracked me down, stalked me to my own dorm, got someone to let you in, came up to my floor, and asked my friends where I was. Oh, after you had already done that earlier in the day. I’m glad I hadn’t been there, and I only know that because my wonderful roommate S told me. 

I’ll admit, I was freaked out. The fact that you cared enough to come find me scared me. I didn’t know how to react. I told you we’d talk later. I’d taken a few shots with my floormates at this point. I wasn’t feeling them yet. I went back to my room. You followed me there and knocked on the door. I pretended I wasn’t there. 

M, B, S and I went to your campus, not to see you, but to see N, A and R. We met up with them and went for a dip in the lake. It was so cold, and so clear, I remember it sharply. I felt the shots at this point, since I had drank straight out of the vodka bottle at N’s room. We went back to your dorm, where R and A lived. I left after a while; they were watching How I Met Your Mother, and it was one I’d seen before (and even at .1% BAC, it’s still not funny).
I ran into you in the hall. I remember what I said; you changed the story. You said I told you I was “fearing for my safety” in A’s room. You liar. I told you I’d had too much and needed a place to detox for a while. I went to your room and threw up for two hours. I give you credit, though; the temptation to fuck the drunk girl must have been overwhelming. Props to you for resiting. Was it only because your roommate was there? 

I remember my friend V calling me, and I ignored it, because I knew I was too far gone to answer. I remember fading in and out of consciousness as you and your friend W tried to talk to me. I laid down on your floor, but I didn’t fall asleep. I stayed awake and listened to you talk to your roommate about me. You said I was special. You told him that I’d told you that he deserved someone better than me (which I had) and that you weren’t going to let me go because of some self-depreciating thought.

Excuse me? You weren’t going to *let* me go? Like you owned me, like I belonged to you? Who the *fuck* do you think you are? I don’t belong to anyone, least of all you.

But the worst part came at around 6:45 in the morning. No alcohol hangover. Just the emotional one. I’d fucked up, and I knew it. My floormates and I had been written up for underage consumption. You remember why? I know you do; it was your fucking fault. You called campus security on us. You stupid fuck, why’d you do that? We were fine; the rest of my floormates were sitting quietly in A’s room, watching tv, and I wanted to get on the bus back to my school. But, oh no, you just couldn’t *let me go*, could you? No, instead of letting me call me sober roommate for a ride, you insisted I stay. And I got a citation. Everyone that had been there that night was mad at me for weeks, mad at me because of you.

The next day, Saturday, we met up and I dumped your ass. You tried to get me to open up again, and explain, but I refused because as far as I’m concerned, you didn’t deserve anymore explanation than “I don’t feel the same way.” Cliché? Maybe, but it worked. You told me about your suicide attempt. Why’d you do that? We;d known each other for less than a month, and you felt that it was right, on the verge of a break-up, to tell me that? Was it a warning? Were you saying “If you dump me, I’ll off myself”? You didn’t do it; I’ve seen you twice since then. It’s a good thing I’m a shallow, cold and emotionless bitch who doesn’t feel anything; otherwise it could have been awkward for both of us. I’m sure it sucked for you; seeing me happy probably killed you, especially since you’d apparently “never felt that way about a girl” before me. 

But all that, nearly every bit of it, isn’t the reason I dumped you. You wanted to know why? You really did? It was because of something that even I am not so callous as to actually say to your face: it’s because you’re fat. Call me shallow, call me a bitch; I don’t care. That’s what it was and is. Your personality is great. But the fact that you don’t take care of your body repulses me. Honestly, fat repulses me. It’s disgusting, and do you know why I react this way? It’s because I used to be you. I used to be the fat one that no one ever paid attention to, ever talked to or made friends with. 

And maybe I was taking that out on you, subconsciously. I’m not cruel as to do it knowingly. Maybe I was venting and making you hurt the way I hurt, making you feel the way I felt as I was rejected again and again, by potential friends and romantics alike. Maybe I just let my college friends tell me the bad things about you, and I choked down the good things. Maybe I let them push me to ditch you. Or maybe it’s simply the fact that I don’t want any reminders of the days when I was fat, the days when I was alone, and no one wanted to talk to me or be my friend. the days when I thought I was so much better and more important than I ever was or am.

So if I could go back in time, JW, this is what I would do. I would sit on the bus and I would ignore you and your friend. I would stare straight ahead, and think about my birthday, think about my life, think about my friends, my family, fuck, anything else. But I would not look round, and I would not meet you. 


And that would be for the best.

On my drive home I was rushing to write all of this down. Something struck me and I was compelled to write all of this down and thought you should know about it. I think it goes a bit like this:

Sometimes people get comfortable. Sometimes people get too comfortable. Comfortable with things they typically wouldn’t want for themselves, their lives, or the individuals that surround them, thus creating a crucial facet of their lives. Be it a bad habit, a resentful idea of a living space, a peer group you feel nothing for, a sour relationship, or a job you hate, people get comfortable. However, what most fail in flying colors to realize is that in this subconscious comfortability comes a sickeningly unrealized immobility. 

People don’t just get comfortable, they get stuck. Nobody needs to take the time to think about what they need to fix or change in their life, everybody is well-aware of these things, yet few follow through. It’s the risk. To pursue these things we need to risk that which we already have. It’s the fear. Not just the fear of losing this risk, not just the fear of losing that which has made us comfortable, but the fear of losing that which has kept us alive.

Survival is our greatest instinctual inclination. Surely it has several competitors running closely behind, but survival’s roots run the most deep of all. As humans, we brush off our bad habits, accept a living space we do not truly want, mislead those we know aren’t our friends with hollow words and skin-deep smiles, justify our lackluster relationships, and conform to our mundane occupations because they are yet to kill us. 

In this light, we could arguably be destined for unhappiness.

I wish, just for an instant, you could see yourself the way I see you.  I wish you could understand how beautiful you are; how, when you are around, it is hard for me to think straight.  I wish I had the words to explain how gorgeous your soul is and how amazing it is to simply talk to you.

The first time I saw you out walking, I felt a sensation that I hadn't felt in a while.  I can't explain it.  I've been single for several years because I didn't feel anything for anyone new that I met.  Then we started talking and you changed that, you changed me.  I don't want you to do so, but you did.  You opened me up in a way I was never expecting.

You told me no when I asked you out.  I understood.  You explained your past and I understood.  I was fine with just being friends.  Being around you, enjoying your presence, was more than sufficient.  I didn't expect anything more, even when every signal I got from you made me think you were interested, that you felt the same connection I did even if you didn't want to admit it.

Then we kissed.  And kissed and kissed and kissed.  How it happened I can't explain.  And still, I know that you aren't ready.  I know that you don't want the same things that I do.  But now...I feel addicted to you.  It's worse than any drug.  When you text me, tell me you miss me, my heart feels so light.  I feel happy.  I don't want to.  I spent so long building up my barriers, protecting myself.  And when you don't text me, I reach to my phone and text you.  No matter my resolve, or how I resist, I still end up sending it.

Then you finally admitted you felt the same connection I do.  Now the walls are cracked, you cracked them, and I am struggling to put them back together.  You still tell me that you think I'll get tired of you.  That no matter what I say, you know that it won't last and that we can't be together because you are an emotional train wreck.

But you don't see yourself like I see you.  You only see your own confusion.  You only see a scared little girl who no one has ever accept for who she was.  You only see the little girl who missed her daddy for not being around. You see the girl who has never had a positive relationship and can't possibly be worth someone's love.  You don't see the goodness I see in you.  You don't even notice the fact that you are the first person to take care of a sick co-worker.  When you do good, you don't see it as anything special.  I know how good you are, I know that you are worth the time and effort.

I know that you will hurt me along the way.  I know, because I know that when you don't feel worthy that you'll run.  I know that I can't love you. I know that I don't want to marry you.  And yet I could.  If my barriers ever fail me, I know I will.  So I struggle to keep them up.  To be your friend.  To not expect anything from you that you aren't willing to give.  I know you need me to be there for you, not as your boyfriend, but as someone who cares about you unconditionally and doesn't want anything from you.  So I struggle, and I fight, and I will continue to be there for you however I can, no matter how difficult that task may be.  I know that you deserve to be happy.  I know you deserve good things from life.  Even if you don't see it in yourself, I know that you deserve to be blessed.

So fucking long. After all of my thinking and pondering and internalising everything, I've come to a conclusion. And sadly enough, it's only when I'm drunk that I ever realise it. The worst part is, I'm drunk a lot.

And what it is I realised? I loved you. I loved you so much. I was in love with you. Then one day you decided that no, you couldn't be bothered anymore. It hurt me much much more than you could realise. More than anyone could realise, because I felt like a complete idiot saying it to anyone because I shouldn't be in love with you, not with as little time as we seemed to have spent together.

To this day, to this fucking day, you play on my mind, and I can't get rid of you. I miss you, but I play out scenarios in my head. Scenarios where you apologise to me, and say you actually care about me again. And I don't know what to do. The logical part of me just says that I should tell you to fuck off. But then I know that if it were to happen, I'd just fall for you all over again. And I'd kiss you. Honestly, if I were to kiss you one more time I'd be okay I think. We just never had any closure.

Whenever I see you around, I'm not sure whether to act like you're my friend, or acquaintance, or just a random person I barely know. When you're around with the rest of our friends, I just want to cry. Because I know that we both know so much about each other but pretend like we're fucking strangers.

I got drunk every day for about three months because I couldn't face being sober around you, anywhere near you. I know how sad that is. But I loved you so much. And I could never ever tell you or any of our friends because I know how ridiculous it sounds. We were only barely seeing each other. But I felt like I connected with you so much. And now when I see you out, I honestly feel like a part of me dies.

If I could have one wish, it'd just be to be your friend again. We act as if we're strangers when I know at one point we cared so much about each other. Well, I did about you. I never could know with you. You always were a bit closed off with things like that. But all your best friends always told me what you'd said about me. And that was the best I've ever ever felt about myself. I'd always doubted every aspect of myself, but with you I felt like you liked me. That's saying something, considering I feel like my closest friends hate me a lot of the time.

I know that's just paranoia. But people like you who crushed my sense of worth don't help that. I know I'm a little bit drunk. And I'm sorry for this being so long. But I don't know if you'll ever know just how much you hurt me.

He was barely walking on his own, and you not only left him in a crowded mall ALONE, you were so busy on your phone you WALKED OUT of the mall without him.

 I watched you, you IDIOT! You called him, and god, did he come running, but what if he had stumbled into some sick person, and not someone who felt bad? What if he smacked into someone dangerous instead of me? 

You then proceeded to walk away from him, leave him alone a SECOND TIME, STILL ON THE PHONE and then call for him AGAIN. He almost got run over by several people and could have been kidnapped EASILY in the ten minutes it took you to figure out where the hell he was. How hard is it to hold his damn hand? 

WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?! 

I'm not a mother. I don't like kids. I refuse to have children.

But my heart breaks for him, because you have no regard for his safety. If I hadn't seen you panic for all of a fourth of a second and call for him, I would have taken him to mall security.

I am tortured with thoughts of you, and though I am sometimes convinced that these feelings have faded, each and every time I fall in love with you again. This is a horrible thing to live with, the love I have for you. I know that it will never in this lifetime be returned. Sometimes I can live with that, but other times I cannot. I truly feel that no matter who you end up with, that this person will NEVER hold the love for you that I do.

And you just cast it aside. You allow me to feel these feelings, and feed the passion inside that I have for you because you enjoy the comfort I bring you, the comfort of knowing that I will always be there for you. You keep me around as a last resort, your dirty little secret no one could know about.

It has taken me two years to finally become fed up with you. My eyes are wide open, and suddenly I can see everything that I have ignored for so long. You have no place for me in your heart. You have no respect for me, not in the tiniest bit. If you did, then you would not treat me the way you do, you would not string me along and play with my emotions because you know that I will put up with it.

You mean everything to me, everything. Yet, I mean nothing to you. Tell me, if I meant anything to you. What I have for you is very precious, and not everyone in this world can say that there is someone out there who sticks by them, through thick and thin. I tell you that I will always love you, and no matter what that I will always be there for you. Even when I was angry with you I was there for you, I will always be there.

For these years, I have put up with your games. I have put up with your neglect towards my feelings, with you shoving in my face your other relationships because I am so desperate to keep you around that I will listen contently.

I remember the time you sent me the longest text message I have ever gotten in my life. It was so hurtful, that I remember the time of day, the season of the year, where exactly I was when I read it, and the complete numbess I felt immediately after reading it. It hurt so bad that I wrote it down because I didn't want to push aside how cruel you were; I wanted to remember for the future when I would eventually gain enough strength to leave you. I had done absolutely nothing to you but profess my love and adoration for you. You responded by writing that my love and dedication to you felt like a burden and only annoyed you.

I remember every single god damned time I professed my love to you, throughout the entire two years I have known you, and how you responded back. You knew what you were doing. You would respond vaguely enough to give me hope, but never enough to give me a direct answer. Never enough to tell me your true feelings, that you have no feelings left for me. But just to be safe, you would never go far enough to give me the satisfaction of receiving your love. You would only say just enough, and as vague as vague could possibly get, to give me hope and lead me on. Don't you dare deny it, because you have admitted it to me yourself in one of your forgotten moments that you only do this to keep me around for your own cruel and selfish pleasure.

This time, I'm not saying it as a strategy to scare you and hope that your love for me will suddenly come back, that you will chase after me to keep me around. This time, I don't want you to come back. I want nothing to do with you, you Cunt I HATE you. You killed the most precious thing in the world, and that is love, understanding, and devotion. You may go through relationships throughout your life, and you are always used to me sitting around waiting, waiting around like some sad, pathetic little kid who has a stupid crush. A dumb guy who you can walk all over like a door mat.

That security is gone. You are alone once again. You can see whomever you please, but just know that if it goes sour, I won't be around to comfort you. I won't be around to keep you company and to remind you that, ""no matter what, just remember that someone loves you.""
 
I will truly never know how you feel about me deep down inside. You are always telling me some sort of distorted truth. Now, it doesn't matter whether or not you are even willing to tell me what goes on in your head. I am not even interested in hearing it, because I know that it will just be the same thing you have been telling me for years. You will never change, and I cannot keep torturing myself like this. I just cannot go an entire lifetime suffering like this anymore.

Don't expect me to wish you Happy Birthday every year, like I have since I've met you. Don't expect me to be there when you need me. Remember when you were going through a hard time with your bipolar? I won't be there to hold you back, to comfort you. I will never again run my fingers through your hair, or cuddle up next to you and rest my hand on your breast.
 
Don't expect me to answer your calls every time and listen to your problems or what's going on with your life. Don't look forward to anything from me anymore. And please understand, I am not doing this to teach you a lesson. I am doing this because I am finally done with you. I am just fed up, and my heart can't take it anymore. I cannot continue loving someone who can't even appreciate my feelings for them.

It's that time of year again where you make the journey back home for a visit.  It is so nice to see you, but I miss you so much the rest of the year.  I enjoy our texts, appreciate pictures of the kids, games of Words With Friends, and other things we do at a distance to make sure we stay connected.

When you do get to come back home, I just have to keep a safe distance from you.  I don't take time off of work with the rest of the family.  I limit the time I spend with you and your crew to minimize the excruciating pain I experience when it is time for you to leave.  As your completely amazing children get older, that pain gets more intense and just amplifies the absence of them in my life.  I can't say this to you, because I know it will only make you feel sad and there is nothing that can be done.  You live 3,400 miles away, have a career, and a husband.

It is also take-your-breath-away painful that I can't be that aunt to your children all of the time.  I just get to be this cool friend once a week every summer.  Believe me, I know there is more I can do throughout the year and I know that disappoints you.  I should send letters and packages to them, be better at remembering birthdays, but the truth is, I never forget - it just hurts too bad.  It is just a reminder of how far away you are and how long I have to wait to see you again, only to make sure I maintain a calculated and cautious distance.

I hope you have a safe flight back.  I love you very much.  You're so much fun.  I love it that we just pick up where we left off the second you arrive into town.  Thank you for spending all of your hard-earned vacation with us. It meant so much to mom and dad that ALL four of us were back at the same time - the first time in 10 years.

Of course you do. I know you know. You can read me like a book, and you're the only one that can. So why do you keep hurting me worse and worse? I know you don't hate me.

I spilled my soul out to you. I broke my rule and opened up. I cut a huge wound in my chest, and instead of suturing it, you throw salt in it. You told me you loved me too. 

You made me a giddy little girl when you said yes. I smiled the widest I ever had in public right then and there. You just laughed and smiled right back at my happiness.
Was it all just to make me happy?

I couldn't even keep you for a whole day. That night you replied to my email. You said your mind was betraying you already. That you had commitment issues. But you promised. 
You said weather it be as a soul sister or soul mate that you'd love me no matter what. But that your self-hating side was winning the battle.

And now. We're still best friends. I never feared losing our friendship. Our souls are synched and we both know that. 
What I feared was losing your love. 
You never told me what side won. But you've made it quite clear anyhow. 
I can't even touch you anymore without you shrugging away or flinching at my hand. Why. I know you can tell it hurts me. That every aversion is a direct stab to my heart. But yet you continue.

I know I'm not perfect. I'm so far from it. I'm not healthy and you're aware of that. You accept me despite all of my fucked up tendencies and cynical introverted personality.

But I love you so much. I need you in so many ways.

I think the worst thing is. I can't stop it. I'll watch you avoid my touch. I'll listen to you gush about cute girls. I'll let you hurt me again and again and I'll never stop. I can't stop. 
So I'm a masochist. Does that affect my current situation? Probably. But no matter how bad you hurt me I'm still perfectly loyal and devoted to you emotionally.

I'd follow you into hell. I'd burn for eternity. I'd fight by your side. And I'd sacrifice my very mind, body, and soul to protect you at all costs.

You are the most important thing in my world.

I've never been good at putting my thoughts and feelings into words, and I was never interested in trying, until I met you. You make me want to be a better man, to change, to grow and to love, for the first time in years.

You say you don't want to be anything more than friends, but the longer I know you, the more I know I can't live with just that. Everything you do just makes me love you, that little bit more, and I can never tell you, because it will destroy what we have.

But I hate what we are. I hate that I think of you constantly, that I have a constant urge to tell you how I feel, again, and again, until I hate myself for causing us both grief that neither of us deserve. I hate that I get jealous of your friends, simply because they're imaginary competition for a relationship I know can't, won't happen, at least not any time soon.

But most of all I hate that I can't be okay with what we are. In the space of a year or so, you've become one of my best friends. We talk about things I wouldn't dream of telling someone else, and even though you're a very open person, I feel like some of the things you tell me are the same. 

As much as I hate what we are, I'm still glad I could be there for you when someone you love died. I'm glad I could help keep your mind off it, even just a little. I'm glad I could make you laugh again a week or two later, and I'm glad I could help, even though all I could do was insignificant in the grand scheme of things, I'm glad I was there.

I love you Nicole, I love you like I've never loved another person before, but I don't want to. I want to be able to be there for you, without getting jealous, without caring who you date.

You were my match.  You were my perfection, you were my end.  I remember the first night we met.  You introduced yourself with a hug. I was mesmerized from that point forward.  I drank every word you said, hung onto your slight accent, craved your touch. 

When you finally kissed me three days later, nobody else mattered.  I felt your hands run down my back and rest on my hips, you pulled me close......brought one hand up and caressed my cheekbone, cradled my face in your hands, bit my lower lip....

I fell in love with your laugh, the way you would run your fingertips down my arms, and trace the bones in my hands.  I fell in love with the way you would pull me into you when we would snuggle up and watch a movie.  I fell in love with this gentle, sweet, funny, caring, cuddly, intelligent man.  I fell in love with the way you'd position me when we slept....my arms wrapped around you, my head on your chest, your legs tangled with mine, your hand resting on the curve of my hip.  You would wake me up in the morning with a smile and you'd lean down and kiss the end of my nose, and pull me closer to you. 

You changed one day, a few months after we met.    No longer did you greet me with a kiss and a smack on the butt.   No longer did we melt into each other when we snuggled up....you were tense, standoffish, shut down.    No longer did you bid me goodbye with a long kiss and a whisper in my ear of something in Russian.  No longer did you reach out to me to pull me close, just to catch a whiff of the perfume on my neck. 

I was going to tell you that week that I fell in love with you.   I was going to tell you how I felt inside.  I was going to tell you that I felt like you were a piece of my soul that had been missing all these years.

You shattered that all away.  You backed away, and tried to make yourself look like the good guy......saying you never thought we were in a relationship....and deny everything you said to me, every feeling you felt, every moment we spent together.....you said we were friends the whole time.

Bullshit.

I reluctantly went to you a week later.   To shut the door on ""us"".  It was tense, awkward, and strange.   You had taken away the life I had planned in my head for us.  You shattered my vision of us.  You cast me aside so easily, yet....when I walk in, you act like nothing happened.  

I was standing in your kitchen, looking outside, telling myself not to cry.  You walk up behind me and put your hand on my lower back, buried your face in my hair, and whispered something in my ear in Russian.  Fuck you.  You dropped me, don't try to reconcile.

We were outside, smoking a cigarette.  You stand next to me, and pull me close to you, running your fingertips down my arms.    I am fighting tears, and you can see it, yet you don't stop. You know your touch is a drug to me.   Fuck you.  You didn't want me anymore.  

We are inside, you sit down next to me, and out your arm around me, and grab my hand.  You twirl my hair in your fingers, pull me in to lean on your chest, you kiss the back of my head.  You know I am crying, my tears spill down my cheeks.  Fuck you.   I wasn't good enough for you anymore.

You are over concerned with my physical well being, because you can tell that the mixed signals I am getting from you are making me physically sick.   You go into Nurse Max mode, and produce a cool cloth on my forehead, a glass of water, and a back rub.   Fuck you.  You have no regard for my feelings for you.

You won't let me leave, you beg me to stay.  You hold my hands as I walk to the door, telling me to stay. Begging me to stay there with you.  Fuck you.  I didn't have the right type of college degrees for you. 

I finally am at the door.   You pull me into you and bury your face in my neck, and squeeze me hard.  If I didn't turn my head away from you, you probably would have kissed me.  You hold me close to your body, breathing in my perfume for two minutes straight.  You have my face in your hands, and I'm fighting tears.    Fuck you.  I fell in love with you and you, so easily, discarded me...pushed me away, and flat out told me you didn't want a relationship with me.   

You were someone I saw myself with forever.  You were someone I wanted children with.  You were someone I would have given up everything for.  You were someone who filled me with so much joy and peace.......yet I was someone you so easily tossed aside.   

I will not play your games.   I will not be subject to your fickle attitude. I will not be sucked in by you.    I fell in love with you, but in the end, I've realized that I love me more.   You are not worth the heartache.  You are not worth the tears I cried over you.  You are nothing to me anymore, because obviously I meant nothing to you.

....

Hey, are you done—oh, you started another game? Well...okay.

....

Are you actually done this time? Okay, good. I'm going to spell this out as plainly as I can, because I'm sick of feeling like shit because of this.

One. When I say I need sex more often, I mean that. When I say that after 48 hours I start getting irritable and feeling unwanted/undesirable/etc., I mean that. When you say stuff like ""your meds are affecting you too much right now, so I'm not going to have sex with you tonight,"" that hurts like hell. Whenever you say ""I don't want sex right now,"" what I hear is ""I don't want sex *with you* right now.""

I know it seems like I'm just nagging you for sex. I can see it in your reactions. Hell, you've said stuff like ""what's going to get you off soonest so I can hurry up and go to sleep?""

But for me...for me, sex is therapeutic. It's not just about getting off, then rolling over and going to sleep. It's about undoing two decades of emotional damage from being told that my own needs and wants and fears and reactions weren't valid and weren't worth anyone's time. It's about relearning how to take care of myself emotionally. Yeah, I could just spend twenty minutes a day with my vibrator, but that's not the same. I spent two years having infrequent bad sex with someone that was emotionally and physically abusive. Now that I'm actually having legitimately good sex with someone that at the very least isn't abusive, I have a lot of lost time to make up for.

Two. I know I'm crazy. Stop telling me I'm not. If I could stop being randomly depressed, I would. If I could control my paranoia and the fifty thousand other things going on, I would. This has been going on for at least six years, if not longer.

The cutting calms me down. The cutting is a way of validating to myself that I'm upset, instead of telling myself that it's no big deal and I need to get over it. The cutting is a way of screaming out that goddamnit, I just need someone to give a shit and listen to me and tell me that it's okay to have emotions and needs and fears.

I know the whole crying-to-get-your-attention thing is getting old. I'm trying to just say these things outright, please understand that. If I resort to crying, it's because I'm at a point where I can't just say it.

I'm probably going to be ricocheting for the next few days while my system gets used to the meds again. I'm also overdue for a major depressive crash, as I mentioned to you. I need stability during all of that. I need some sort of routine, whatever that happens to be.

If this isn't something you can deal with, please just let me go. I won't be angry with you for it.

....

Addendum: I wrote this completely during what would be the first LoL game in the opening exchange. After posting, I went back to talk to him only to find him playing game #2. 

I saw it coming a mile away, but it still pisses me off that even though he said we'd talk about this stuff after he got out of class today, even though he got out of class *three and a half hours ago,* even though he can see I'm not exactly chipper, he'd still rather play this stupid game than talk to me. I get that it's his socialization with friends from back home—I'm fine with that. I'm just tired of being second place to a computer.

If that makes me needy, then fuck him. If that makes me the stereotypical ""crazy girlfriend,"" then fuck him. If he can't actually get off his ass and stop staring at a screen long enough to notice that I'm not exactly okay, then fuck him.

It may not sound like it, but I do actually want to make this relationship work.

.....

Update, as promised:

He did read this, and we spent some time talking things out. You know when two cars both have their turn signals on, and they phase in and out of sync? That's us, basically. Is this something I can deal with long-term? I don't know, because I don't know how much of my reactions right now are based on my psych meds and/or birth control. I'm personally doing a lot better, which leads me to think that perhaps the past week or so of me getting upset at every. single. damn. thing. was just a temporary thing. Hopefully, anyway. It's something I'll mention to my psychiatrist next time I see him, certainly. In any case, with regards to this relationship, I've realized that what I get from sex is not something that I can only get from sex, and treating it like an exclusive thing was causing most of my frustration.

I miss you. 

You came to me at a point where many people slide into complacency - where they get A and B and settle down to spend the rest of their lives. We had both moved on from people who had settled into habits where guilt and shame were currencies, and helped each other through those times, even though we weren't the cause of it.

We were far apart, because love isn't limited to those people you grew up with in highschool anymore, but we made the time to see each other.  I remember the first time we met, I couldn't even stand, and had to find a seat.  You said it was ok, and held my face in your hands as you kissed me.  It felt like I had come home.

We made plans for a life together. We were going to have a child with my blue eyes and your beautiful smile. The world became something that we lived in, but it couldn't get into the circle that was us.  We carved pumpkins. I kicked your ass in Mario Kart.  Our food would often grow cold on the table because a small kiss would cascade into so much more.

We tried, we really did, but the job market wouldn't stabilize, and I couldn't leave where I was without ensuring I could support us as well as see my children that I love.  You couldn't come to me for the very same reason.  We wanted to bring those children together into a family.

Like sidewalk chalk in the rain, what we created together became faint and began to wash away.  I remember saying goodbye to you at the airport for the very last time and turning to leave.  I didn't turn back to wave goodbye before going in.  I wish I did.

We couldn't and we can't because we love.  
We didn't and we won't because we are true to those that count on us, where many would have put themselves first.

You woke me up and helped me become who I really am.
You loved me unconditionally.

You pushed me to be better.

I'm fighting the urges that would make me reach out and be pathetic, and be desperate.  But truth be told, I am pathetic and desperate.  I'm fighting this war in my head between letting you go completely and allowing hope to get me through to tomorrow.  We haven't talked in weeks.  It's been months since you told me that the life we were excited about, the connection we had, and the feelings we shared were not enough to overcome the confusion and the conflict.  You've been under a cloud since you moved away and you did your best but it was time to live your own life.

But I can't move on.  I'm too old and I've seen true happiness with you.  We were so alike and loved all the same things that in order for me to completely forget you I feel I have to completely change who I am.  I was happy with myself before you.  I was happier with you.  Now what?  Do I change who I am in order to move on with my life?  I can't separate hundreds of thousands of Lego to give you back what's yours.  I can't stop wanting to be a part of what makes me happy without wanting to share it with you.  Every second of my day something happens and I think how I'd love to tell you about it.  Every time my email or phone lights up, I wish it was you.  I find myself scanning all my networks knowing I've blocked you but looking for you anyway.  I'm just having such a hard time moving on.  You were so important to my life.  And you left it open with ""Who knows?""

I need to find a way to be happy with myself again, indifferent to you not being in my life, but hopeful the time you needed to be away will not be infinite.  I want to simultaneously be okay but always open for your return.  I want to look forward to the inevitable time when we are together again and we can share all these geeky, cute, important, learned, sweet, and thought provoking things again.  I couldn't have put on paper, if someone asked, all the ways we fit together, all the ways you made my life a joyful experience.  I couldn't have picked someone better to share my life because your life was very much the same.

But in the end it wasn't, was it?  You were too confused, too scared, and too young.  The love we had, the plans we made, the life we could have celebrated wasn't enough to overcome the idea that you weren't done living on your own.  It was more important to you to stand alone than live with me.  And I know that means you've found someone else and you want to explore that.  If that's the honest reason, I wish you'd have told me.  I trust you, and if all you wanted to do was be on your own, then I wish you well.

But I have to tell you, that if you asked me back today, I'd come back.  I'd leave my job and my family to be with you.  I've told them, they understand.  If you asked me in six months you'd get the same answer.  If you asked in 6 years, I'll still be here.  I know I treated you well and I loved you unconditionally.  I celebrated your flaws and strengths equally.  I gave you the understanding you needed to grow and survive.  I know you loved me with everything you were.  You didn't ask anything of me other than affection.  You saw the inner geek and loved me for it.  I know together we were amazing.  I know that I won't find someone your equal again.  I'm old enough to know this, and I'm old enough to be patient.

So when you're done finding yourself, I will be here.  It won't be the same, it'll be a new day and a new life, but it'll be with you.  I won't ask any questions, I will just celebrate with joyous shouts to the world that I love you and nothing in this world can take that away.

I can read you like an open book right now. You're not very happy I'm taking Krav Maga, but I also feel your reasons lie in the wrong places.

One of your reasons: It's not making me appealing to boys.

My response: That was never the point of it. I didn't take up fighting to please other people, or to impress a boy. I took up fighting because I was tired of getting picked on and belittled for being a girl, or told my A's don't matter, the skipped year of math wasn't as important as being sexually appeasing at 12 years old.

Fighting helped me feel better when I wanted to smash the world. Fighting kept Sam and I safe when the principle stood by and the let the kids sexually harass us.

I know, you want me to fit in and stop coming home with bruises, scrapes, and sore muscles, but I feel my best at the gym. Everyone's kind there, we can all respect each other, and I don't feel the subconscious need to look over my shoulder every two minutes.

Another reason: I'm getting/might be hurt.

My response: Mom, the scraped knuckle is nothing. The bruised elbow shows how hard I can hit. I know my sparring and training partners well, and we all know not to cross boundaries or injure each other. 

Remember A and the soccer net? How he wouldn't listen to the teachers, and kept hitting me in the head?

Remember M? How he tried to hurt Sammy? How he had a whole crowd of kids jeering him on to hit my defenseless sister?

I remember. I got bruised, M nearly broke my skull on the floor, and A left a mark on my elbow. 

That was where I was SUPPOSED to be safe. How the teachers would always be watching, and bullying was just to further the plot of a movie or book.

I felt safer at the gym than I did in that hell-hole, even when I was getting knocked around in the ring. I knew I could trust everyone there, and they always know when it's time to stop. Krav saved my skull from breaking, and taught A a damn good lesson on when people snap.

It's also shown me that I don't need to fear those who try and act bigger. I'm learning to hit harder.

Reason 3: It's not girly.

My response: This ties into #1. ""Should a 14 year old girl really be doing this?"" Yes. Yes. Yes. Hell yes.

Being ""Girly,"" is not a priority, or anywhere near the list of things I want to be. I'm tired of being told I have to do this, I have to do that, I have to please him, I have to be skinnier than her.

I'm going into High School, and in 4 years, college. Do you really expect me not to run into a hairy situation, where my boundaries won't be respected, or someone wants to try and attack me?

Being girly is not one specific thing. Yeah, I'm wearing pigtail braids, but I also have ripped my 2nd knuckle from punching so hard. I'm making my own definition of it, by me and for me.

To sum this up:

I was not put here to try and kiss up to people, accept blows, and watch my sister come home depressed because a kid told her to ""Suck his dick,"" 8 times in the hallway.

I don't need to please a boy to prove my worth as a person, and I damn don't need to be a doormat if push comes to shove.

I learned Krav Maga because I was tired of being walked all over, and told to suck it up like a dog in a desert finding a well.

It's not ""Pretty,"" it's not ""Attractive,"" it's not, ""Feminine,"" whatever that's supposed to mean, but it is me, my life, and my want to protect myself, my family, and tell assholes to piss off. 

Sorry if this was whining, but it's been the little comments building up.

Because it would mean you're thinking of me too. See now that I've been sober for a while I've realized a lot about myself. Among other issues I was really deprived of all human relationships and friendships my entire life, and I've always wanted to just be normal or at least have something I could just call normal in my life, with someone. That's always been what I wanted and I never had anyone to teach me that. It's sad I may really be a lost cause at finding something somewhat normal in a relationship. I realize now why I ended up here, the state of mind I'm at now. I was so sick of drinking back when we first met that I needed a reason to sober up and the only way in my mind at the time I could do that is if someone could actually get to know me for all my flaws and drive me to want to change. even though I didn't know this at the time, that's what I was really looking for. and you so far have been the first person in my life in a long time to really influence good behavior in me. I don't know if you know that that's what you really did but it is. After really getting to know you, I found there were things I wanted to change about you, then decided I liked you for you, because you're a good person and the things I wanted to change was my bad behaviour trying to rub off but didn't. I'm so glad it didn't I'm so glad you're as good as you are, you taught me without even knowing it how to care for another human being. I don't maybe it's love on my end. And since it seems at this point to be one ended I don't know what the best answer is. See, in trying to change I'm actually trying to do what's best for other people instead of just me for a change. I really think I'm slowly finding God again. I know it's crazy, maybe you do believe in God maybe you don't. I just wish I knew the real effect I have on you, what you really think of me, and then we could decide. I justt don't know if you'd even want to still be my friend after knowing this, because I wouldn't want you to feel guilty or make you uncom, I know you're still in love with your ex but it's been nearly a year, and although we don't talk about the subject last I heard he moved on and you seem to be stuck, And that's another thing. honestly I just want to do something right in my life and you'd probably think I'm insane if you read this actually you probbly already do think I'm insane. I guess I'm trying to say this might be goodbye because I really am lost and trying really hard to find myself. I just don't know anymore. but I think I'm goimg to try to let go now. You can have me back in your life but it's like a counselor I have to stop trapping people in my mind in my addiction. it's not that i believe you're trapped in it. but in my mind I think I'm trapping you, so one day If I decide to send this, just know you're the first person I've met that's made a better person out of me, and I thank you for that. again I can't fully explain it but I just don't want to hurt you, and I'm just such a mess of a person right now but I truly am trying. either way I'll leave you alone for a while and if i do decide to send this just know this is how much you mean to me right now.
P.S. no I didn't just want to bone you, in case you can't tell. Unfortunately, you might not believe it but this really is how i felt. and I'm crazy so leaving you alone would be the better choice for a while because of how neurotic I really am. Thinking of you also made me realized how unhealthy this really is, but how at the same time it's kind of healthy because it keeps me from drinkiing and at the end of the day, that's what matters to me and after getting to know you I think It's a huge driving force with you, helping an alcoholic, or someone with a history of substance abuse. so you did it, without even trying.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1ipuuf,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ipuuf/to_you_dont_think_i_should_send_ot/,

I have not had so much fun being myself since I've met you.


Yet. I feel as if I'm about to make a mistake.



When I met you, all the guys at work would NOT stop talking about how hot you were. Funny, I mentioned this quite a bit to you. You never seemed to believe it. Well, too bad. You lose, your beautiful. 



I had heard this story multiple times throughout my life by guys. I was one of the few who went out of his way in highschool to be friendzoned. I didn't do it intentionally at the begining. After a while though, seeing so many ""hot"" chicks for who they were. I realized the perks of being on the sidelines.



I saw you. 9.5. Dancer. Prep. I didn't get my hopes up.



After a while of hearing the guys run their gums raw, I decided to talk to you. Honestly, with the pure intention of proving you were a bitch.



You were still training, I made a few sarcastic remarks to your trainer. You smiled. I arched an eyebrow, and walked away.



I kept at it. I spent my breaks talking...then my Lunches. I slowly realized that my attempt to bitch nab you, was now me genuinely conversing with you. That was not good.



I had to settle this. I went to work, and after everyone was gone I asked your schedule. Planned a date. I gave you my number. I didn't ask for yours. I didn't plan on needing it. Ever.



You never texted. I had won. I invited a friend over to hang out. We played video games that I sucked at. Then I got a text. 



""Are we still good for today?""



I stared at it for a solid ten seconds before the white noise in my head let my friends voice filter in. 



We went out for Coffee.



I have never met a girl that could hold a conversation with me about anything and keep engaged. And best of all, you were sarcastic, witty, and you laughed at my jokes.




I went home. And pounded out a song on my laptop. (background: I'm a DJ and a electronic producer. No genre limit.) That was months ago, and I'm still working on it.



We began to talk more, hang out more, date more.




I...began to have feelings. Which I hated. It was always so much fun to talk about how silly the idea of marriage was, and how love ceased to exist. The irony of those conversations now.




Then...came trust.



Not telling me about trying to kiss my best friend. Even if you were drunk. I don't know why you didn't say anything. 



I trusted you.



Making out with a complete incompetent asshole that all the girls had to push off them. All of them had drugs, alcohol, most both in their system. They had enough integrity to push him off. 

You had nothing in your system. And you made out with him. At my apartment. We all could hear. You said nothing, till my friends called you out.

I trusted you.

My best friend flirts with you constantly, attempting to make you crack. So he can give me a reason I should drop you. He hates you. You said nothing.

I trusted you.


...I get a phone call from my best friend. We have a shot. We are getting flown to New York City for a shot with several record labels. We have till the end of this month. If it works out. We will be making music for a living. They will pay for us to move to L.A. And that will be our job...


You texted my best friend. You said that you didn't want to do anything with him, because you knew I liked you...
My best friend, as well as my room mates tell me I should give you a shot. Despite everything.

How can I trust you?

You haven't trusted me.

And the worst thing? I feel like you have begun to trust me. I feel as if you are beginning to develop feelings for me. Which is what I've wanted.

Yet, cynicism keeps me at bay. Perhaps, she feels security in showing feelings now that I might become somewhat famous. Maybe, she just wanted a fling to begin with, but now the chances are sealed that she won't see me again...

I hope this is not true, but I fear that the more she trusts me. The less I trust her.


I can't be with someone who can't trust me. And so far she hasn't shown that enough to out weigh the reasons why I can't trust her.

Regardless of trust, I can say this honestly. 

You are one of the most talented people I know. I am guilty of leading conversations towards dancing countless times just to see the lights behind your eyes as you remember choreography, songs, and memories. I imagine music is my parallel. 

I wish you could of seen my face my roommates told me that you were a 7.5 and not their type. My jaw dropped in confusion, anger, and disbelief. I could not believe that they saw you that way. 

You are beautiful. Not just personality. Your body distracts me constantly. I had to memorize your eye color if somebody asked. I'd have to make this forum NSFW if I wanted to continue so MOVING ON!

The exact moment I realized I had lost the battle against my heart was when I was teaching you guitar in my room and that entire time. Not a single sarcastic remark was made. It was...real.

And I still have the paper in my desk that you wrote when you finally beat me at Mario Kart 64. Not that you needed the paper after my roommates saw it.

I had writers block for a while, and I had no idea why. I realized I was so confused about how I felt about you. That the only way to sort anything was to resume work on your song.

When I got you to run with me up in the mountains as dusk fell on the valley. And how you managed to keep up with me. I swear I wasn't staring at your ass...for that long. COUGH! What?

I'm not in love with you. I'm logical and realistic enough to know that. I do have feelings for you though. As long as your happy I will be happy. Even if there is some sadness mixed in there sometimes. 

I might have problems trusting you, but honestly.

1369916572.0,16,self.UnsentLetters,1fbywk,Letter to ______,to_my_best_friend,16,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1fbywk/letter_to/,"Dear ____, 

You don't have to invite me to your wedding. It was so nice of you but really, it is okay if you don't. I wouldn't belong there. I know everyone is going to be happy. 

I can't do that anymore. I'm afraid I'd ruin it a little bit just by being there. I'd be there and what's inside of me would seep out. I know people can see it. It has nothing to do with your wedding. It's just me. 

I can still be happy sometimes. But it never lasts. It's so brief. There's no escaping this. It owns me. If I was at your wedding I'd have to try really hard to show I'm happy for you even though I definitely am. It's like I'm drowning. 

The only conclusion I can make is I'm rotten inside. 

I left school because I had to. It has been nine years, ____. Nine. It's like I've been in prison the whole time. My crime is being me. 

It's possible part of my spirit is gone now. I don't doubt that at all. Every time I talk to someone I pretend so hard to be normal. Every smile I make is to hide a grimace. I'm hurting. 

Part of me thinks you already know that and have always known that. 

I still think of you as my best friend. I wish I could tell you this but I can't. I have tried to get better for years. There's nothing inside me anymore except sadness. It has never ended. 

I'm scared.

I really want to end my life but it's not an option and it's frustrating. Finishing college is an option, meeting someone is an option, living in a new city is an option, getting a career is an option, doing amazing  things is an option, growing old is an option. Everything is an option. 

I'd spoil it all. If I did it all I'd be pretending to be normal the whole way. 

I know it's true. I know that even if I go somewhere absolutely blissful looking, I will thinking about fucking killing myself. 

I look at the Maldives and it's beautiful, but I see it and I just know. I know that about myself. 

I'd want to be *there* but I wouldn't want to be *here*, here as in fucking alive. 

I took care of a baby for a long time and I know what I thought about when the baby wasn't there. I thought about fucking killing myself. 

I loved that baby. He was all I had. Even he didn't want me to be sad. It breaks my heart because I already have seen disappointment on his face when he saw how sad I was once. He wanted me to be happy. He was such a happy baby. 

The future is just trying to find ways to keep the sadness at bay. A little less painful. I will never truly be happy. If I meet someone and they can make me happy it won't last. I don't like that the happiness will only exist because of them. I want that happiness but what happens if they don't want me anymore because I get sad? They will be gone and so will the happiness and the sadness will be even more intense. And I know if they're gone I know for sure it's because they think something's fucking wrong with me. 

I just don't want to do anything anymore. I disappoint myself. I don't like being this way.  

I didn't even want to talk to you. If I died at fifteen it would have put a nice cap on this all. Stop it before it went too far. 

You asked me what I want to do with my life. The answer is nothing. I don't have anything inside of me. Nothing but the fucking sadness. 

I still try. I still hope. But I don't know if it's realistic. I'll still try to find out while wanting to give up the whole time. 

Every day has been a nightmare. It's a day to day thing and I'm tired of it. I go up then come crashing down. 

Suicide is too complicated. If I killed myself, I'd unleash my sadness on certain people and I don't want to do that. 

I can live with this but it hurts. 

I still hope. I do. I just can't stand disappointing myself. Which is all the time.  

Going to your wedding would be too hard. I don't know if you're inviting _____ but if you are, if she saw me, she'd know. She's always known. 

She tried to keep me safe. She tried to help me. Do you even know what she did for me? 

Fuck. 

You should have married her. 

She understood me, you understood me... I know you guys were just kids back then, but I wish you guys stayed together and married each other. It's so selfish but you two were my best friends. You guys made me so happy. 

That's when I know I just don't have it in me. Some people can make me happy but they're not going to always be around. There are only a couple things that make me happy. I don't even remember what the fuck they are. 

This letter is fucking sad. Fuck. I'd never be able to tell you any of this. You can't help me now and I'm tired of pretending. I know it's been four years but I can let you go again. I'm sorry. It's the best way. Don't worry about me. There's nothing you can do. I just wanted to say hi. You didn't have to give a shit.

I know others would call it an infatuation ... an obsession. At best a preoccupation or crush.

But I know I haven't gone a day since meeting you that I haven't smiled thinking of you. I know every time I see you my heart leaps from my chest. I know your laughter rings in my ears for days after I hear it.

I know we made our distance. I know we made our choice, and we'll never again really even be friends ... not like that. But I never knew how you really felt, and you never knew how I did either. And that is as heartbreaking as anything else.

I'm glad I love her and you love him. And we're happy with our others ... and we're happy with our lives. But I can't help that there are vast tracks of real estate in my heart with your name on all the signposts. Long horizons where we run to each other .. and we run and we run ... but it's all just horizon.

I can't help that we're halted by everything from our past.

So what is this? What is this stone I work over in my mind and polish with hope. How many smiles and hugs and nervous long looks must I endure? How much chit chat, how many little reminders that we're still barely in each others' lives, but our righteous hearts must have no place for the other?

I hate it. I hate the guilt, knowing we have loves of our own. I hate the secret I hold as we all try to act like there was nothing and we're all still everyone friends. Everyone friends, and nothing ever changes much. ""It's so good to see you though."" Oh that simple understatement ... ""We should get together more often."" Be still.

I just want my heart not to be torn.

And maybe we never shared a thing. Maybe this burden I bear holds all this horrible weight for no one but me. I am frozen. My tongue, my hand, my heart ... halted.

I am chained and can't strip from myself this hope ... this nebulous want. I don't even know exactly what I want from this ... from you ... I can't bring myself to unfold this desire. I can't finish this sentence because I already know how it ends.

My honor, your honor ... it's all wrapped up in our lives apart from one another ... but when you are in the room, I have to force myself to see anything else ... I have to lean in with all my will to hear another voice. And when you aren't in the room I have to chase the ghost of your vision from my mind. I have to erase in my heart every thread of this longing.

I get it. You're broken. I'm broken. You're involved. I'm married.
But know this ... I still cling to hope for your happiness. I live to know you are well.

If what I feel for you is not Love, I care not for Love at all.

I'm a 21 year old mildly overweight guy who still lives with his parents and my one social flaw is that I'm not good at talking to women that i don't know, so this is my outlet, I don't know you well enough to say I love you so i won't, but every thursday night in class, even though i try too, i cant take my eyes off you.  You are the most beautiful person ive ever seen, and ive overheard your conversations (small room only 9 people in class) and you seem to be intellectual, funny, and a real joy to be around, and i'm no prize myself so, a part of me keeps saying to stay back and let you get a guy that is in your league, cause god knows i'm not, the other half of me says go Rager (we'll call me that for the letter's sake), do it, get her to like you, but then the fear comes in of me talking to women, i cant shake that embarassment that happened in high school enough to just say, ""Hello, I'm Rager"", I'm scared to death of what you will say, will you tell me to leave you alone forever, and send me crawling back into my hole even more fearful of rejection and women, or will you just say ""hi Rager, I'm Anna"" which will just make me so happy inside, I don't know. It's seriously like a 2-1 handicap match (wrestling fan) of feelings, don't do it, vs. do it, so I never do it.  It will kill me to see you with another guy, but if you're happy with him. i'm mature enough to let you go, but it will be hard.

You had to satisfy some sort of inner need to dominate and subordinate, so you took out this need on a sensitive, nice kid who didn't deserve your criticism. But you know what. It's all ok. Because while you're doing whatever fucking worthless shit you're doing over at pathetic &lt;his college&gt;, I'm over here at &lt;my college&gt; doing productive things and preparing myself for a bright future full of MONEY. That's right. Because you pushed me into a state of social anxiety and low self esteem I got into computers. And I'm pretty damn good at them too. I bet you aren't.

You have the emotional maturity of a three-year-old, and can't connect with anyone of the opposite sex. Your dad yelled at you daily, while my dad is proud of me and supports me. I hope you learn that, someday, if you have a legitimate child, that it takes love and respect to properly raise a child, so that some other kid doesn't have to suffer at the hands of your son because you don't know how to raise him.

Every part of me believes what you say except the logical side of me. You say one thing and do another. Your speech and your actions doesn't match. Sometimes you make me think that I don't matter to you at all, but I know you do. You're just terrible at showing it, or maybe that's what I want to believe. It sometimes feels like you don't listen to the words you say, but a part of me knows you're being sincere. Everything that you make me feel, I'm okay with it. But my mind tells me I shouldn't be. I know I seemed a little bitter the last time we talked, I tried to hide it the best I can, but in reality I don't think you noticed. I hate feeling that side of me. I hate it, yet still, I want you around. Sometimes I think you don't know me at all, and other times I don't care. I love you. I truly do, so much more than you know. It makes so much more sense to say goodbye than to cling on to you, because when I think about it, you're not worth it but in my heart you are, but in my mind, I don't want that. I believe that in everything that you know, that you do love me, but I wonder if it's enough.

I can't believe myself.  I must have a kind of fixation, a habit of not knowing when I should just throw in the towel, as the cliche goes.

I've been playing this internal game for months now, ever since we really started getting to know each other.  Our witty repartee started out as semi-drunken joking around, but the more I ended up finding myself talking and spending time with you, the more I realized how utterly in sync we are.  There's this kind of electricity that just brings me to life when I'm around you.  Something that stems from the fact that you keep me on my toes, meeting my own wit with your own and still managing to keep me smiling and surprised despite my own unpredictability.

I'm transfixed.  I'm utterly blown away.  And I don't know what to do.

First, my excuse for not being forward about the feelings I developed for you was that we worked together.  Then, I decided to push on anyway.  I'm not sure what would have happened if I had been more direct much earlier.

When the excuse disappeared, and my life situation re-aligned itself, I suddenly found myself trying to find more excuses to test my wit against yours, spend more time together.  I'm just wondering if I waited too long.  If maybe my spontaneity, my absurdity, my caution in acting killed any chance I had.  So naturally I had to think of a grand gesture, something really show-y.  Something creative, something unique, something that would, without question, make it quite clear exactly how important you are to me.

Lady, I have never been so impassioned, so driven to complete something for someone else in my whole life.  And in the act of that project, throughout the 'doing' of the work, you were on my mind.  I envisioned all the potential ways you'd react to every little thing, and imagined myself the conductor of a grand symphony only meant specifically for you.

Well, the symphony has been given over to you, but the only music I want to hear is that of your voice meeting mine once again, crafting absurdity like a master clockmaker feverishly setting the cogs of his greatest timepiece.

A weaker man would have given up long ago.  Probably a smarter man, too.  But there's just something about you that draws me in, keeps me from giving up on my pursuit altogether.  There's something about the way we make each other laugh, the sense of deep reflection, the unspoken communication.  There's something that just keeps you on my mind, makes my chest swell, makes me come alive.

I feel that, given the opportunity, I would tell you all of this.  Or most of it.  Maybe just enough to make it abundantly clear that I'm fairly sure I've fallen for you, and fallen hard, without sounding like some sort of head case.  Maybe just enough to describe how I haven't felt this strongly about someone in a long time, and haven't felt this kind of subconscious magnetism in even longer.  
(Wouldn't use the 'L' word, because that is something that grows over time and is nurtured.)

But I haven't been able to get that chance, due to conflicting schedules, or the lack of a response for some reason or another.  I'm an adult and fairly independent, so I'm not wiling away the hours simply pining for you in despair...  But I do wish I could have one evening, just you and I, in which I could finish the symphony I started with one final flourish and find out once and for all if I've just been on a fool's errand all this time.

One night, one conversation, just a few minutes to tell you how I feel.  You're too beautiful, too intelligent, too witty, too hilarious, too lovely of a person for me to allow to enter and leave my life so quickly.  I don't want to regret not being able to say something for the rest of my life.

It's funny in a cosmic way, Lady.  A lot of guys who fall for their best female friends have ample opportunity but lack the courage.  I've built up the courage considerably, but haven't gotten the opportunity.  This isn't something I want to disclose through text or writing.  It's something that I feel should be done in person, one on one, with the understanding that I won't be hurt should my intentions be misaligned with any potential for the future.  I just simply want to express myself and find out where I stand, nothing more, nothing less.

I also want to do something stupid and impulsive and kiss you when you least expect it, just to see how you'd react.

Lady, this may be either the dumbest course of action I've ever decided to take, or the greatest in my life.  All I know is that I dig you.

A lot.

No one will ever understand how much it hurts.
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you.
And when it's over, and it's gone, you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you could have the good.""

I still can't believe it's over between us. 

I know people say this a lot when relationships end, but I really thought you were different. I know you still are different than most men, but still not the good kind of different one would normally expect.

I was your first date, your first kiss, your first everything - and you're 24. We fell in love quickly. It wasn't a first love for me, but it was still love... a kind of love I hadn't felt in over two years. I loved your shy awkwardness, your geeky hobbies - everything about you I found so adorable. I was enamored by you. You were so utterly good to me.

Then, it was like a switch flipped. I suddenly grew bored of constantly sitting around doing nothing with you. The thought of sitting on my couch watching TV for the fifth night in a row was something I dreaded. So, we stopped spending as much time together. We took long walks at the park to spend time, which was fun. I thought the ""distance"" apart would make me excited to see you again when we would spend lazy days in. But for some reason, it didn't. I grew sick of always asking you to come up with other things to do. It was always me thinking of things. Apparently, this was hard for you to do. 

So hard, that after bringing me lunch at work on Sunday and kissing me goodbye, you broke up with me less than two days later. Over a text message. Out of the blue. And then you wouldn't respond to me until I dragged a response out of you nearly eight hours later.

I did not deserve this. Like I mentioned before, I don't think you are a bad person. But it definitely shows the kind of person you are to break up with me over a text message and then never want to talk to me again. You said you didn't know why you told me you loved me the day before. I wish you hadn't. Then I would maybe have somehow, half-expected this to be in our future. Clearly, you are not at all mature enough for a serious relationship. 

As angry as I am at you, my heart is breaking. I called in sick to work yesterday, and my manager sent me home after an hour today because I started sobbing at my desk. And I'm laying here in my new bed set (I had to replace it because my old bedding reminded me of you), I can't help but think what you're doing at this very moment. You're probably having fun with your friends - I know you will be tomorrow, at least. I doubt you've even thought of me. If you have, you've probably thought of how glad you are to be rid of me. I bet you're not even the least bit affected by this. 

That's what hurts the most. When we first met, I was afraid to jump in with both feet. I was left with scars from my last terrible relationship, and I didn't want something like that to happen again. But you seemed perfect for me, so I took a chance... and here I am, left in almost the exact same way as I was before. 

I feel like my chest has been ripped out and I just have a constant, dull pain pouring out of me every second of every day. I've hardly eaten the past three days.

While part of me hopes that you will, in some way, apologize... another part (the majority) hopes that you won't. Your silence will help me heal faster. And if you ever did start talking to me again, and if you maybe even hinted at getting back together... I still would not no matter how much I wanted to. I'm worth more than that. I'm worth more than the way you left it. You don't deserve my company with the way you broke things off.

Hi.
 
So I've heard good things about your recovery (I'll believe it when I see it). In any case, I'll take one last chance at believing you're on the right track and drop the charade I've had going for the past.. oh.. couple decades? ""Strike while the iron is hot"" as they say. Well. Anyways, If what I hear is true, and what I hope happens is you don't relapse immediately because you're weak to peer pressure and kind of a moron at times (actually, probably all the time), I figured you finally deserve a dip into my thoughts.
 
Let's cut to the chase here, I don't like you very much. That was probably obvious. I never did, really. You were quite miserable to me when I was younger. I despised you. Sure, some might dismiss at as sibling rivalry thing, but man, I couldn't have disliked you anymore. I don't think I've felt any sort of ounce of love towards you at all. I tried. But failed. I never even wanted to touch you or make eye contact. I feel like I need to shower if I do.
 
And as we went along, the vision became clear that I really shouldn't try to improve the self-destructive relationship we had. Again, I tried, believe it or not, but you were my example of what true evil was, for the longest time, but then I realized after a while you're just not very smart. There was absolutely nothing I could do to allow me to give you any sort of respect because you'd piss it all away the second I thought you were getting better.
 
I gave up on you incredibly early. Like, 13 years old early. The first time I've heard you get into arguments with our parents like that, screaming and all, I immediately knew we were in it for a very long haul. Drugs were spoke of. Alcohol was found under beds. Money (THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY MY GRANDPARENTS) would be stolen out of my own bedroom.(I still don't know who it was, but remember, I am a pessimist with a very good streak of winning guesses. This does not stack well to your favor). I would be forced to eavesdrop on terrible conversations you and L would have. How you hated our loving parents who never gave up on you. How much money you spent on drugs. How drunk you got last night. It wasn't fun, knowing your sisters were obvious whores. I knew this was the beginning of the end. And throughout the whole time, I was right. Correct. Right in every way. I'd assume you would do or did something horrible, and I was right. I hated being right. I grew up to become pessimistic, jaded and generally depressed because of what you did to this family. When I was right about you, I felt satisfaction. I LIKED it. I grew up to hate. Hate everything. Assume everybody was out to get me. I assume I'm on everyone's bad side, and I have laughable self-confidence. You think I'm an angel, the crowd favorite. But I'm really not that good. I'm a terrible person. I drove away the only girl on this planet I've ever had feelings for because of my self-esteem. Was this your fault? I don't know. I don't care.
 
God, if our parents were anything like me, if they even thought an OUNCE like me, you would've been in prison a long time ago, and possibly fucking dead. Dead. They are amazing people for putting up with a shit-bird like you. I wanted you out of the house since I was in grade school. I don't think I've had hate for a person like I did for you. And I don't think I will again. You're a real over-achiever, kiddo.
 
You know what were the worst days of my life? Helping you and L move into your apartments. You got to move out on our parents budget simply because you're such an obnoxious shithead, you got a free apartment out of it. And I had to wake up early after a another night of depressed insomnia because my sisters are retarded, and move giant cabinets and nice furniture to a decent apartment that you didn't deserve. Terrible. I wanted to throw up. You got a royal treatment for being awful.
 
My friends apparently have you and L added on Facebook for whatever insane reason. Probably because they like the whore-thing you do all the time. Actually, they don't really, they like to come to me and complain, and ask about why you both put such provocative pictures. Actually, I don't know if you had, I'm just blatantly assuming again and hoping I'm wrong, but L definitely has, as she seems to be the star of the show during these embarrassing conversations, and they literally had to remove her because how sickening her profile pictures were. They made my friends sick. Sick. And I immediately assumed you were doing the same thing. That’s how bad I've gotten.
 
I remember when Mom told me you were having an unexpected pregnancy. You know what my reaction was? I laughed. Who would laugh at that? A pessimist who was right. Again. An unwanted pregnancy. Surprise. Not really. I laughed. I was right again. My brain reacted normally to something I was naturally right about. Same thing with L. I laughed. Mom cried. Felt like shit afterwards. Now your child is here. I laughed at my nephew's birth. I'm a monster.
 
Speaking of Mom, all she refers to you and L is ""idiot"" and ""moron"". I don't think she's said your first name to me in years. You're just an idiot and a moron. I mean, at least I called you K. Wow. S doesn't speak too highly of you either. Dad has completely mentally shut you both out, and pretend there's nothing wrong, as per usual. He can try to hide it, but his heart and blood pressure can't. And everyday at their house, that fist-hole impressed into the closet door reminds me that he is hurting too. And I want to cry. The happiest guy I know, crushed by his own daughter.
 
Am I making you angry? Good. It feels like that's the only motivation I can give you. I want you to get mad. I want you to prove me fucking wrong. I want you to make me look stupid. I want to see your child put everything behind him when he's older, and think of you as the greatest mother in existence. I want you to finally destroy this general pessimism I've had forever. Because to be honest, I want all of this, but I also want a Dodge Charger but that doesn't mean I know it's going to happen.
 
This is pretty negative, and I would apologize, but I probably shouldn't let up. I've pent this up for a long time, and had no real way to tell you how I felt. You and L have both been a major cause to my depression, and I don't want to tell anybody that, but I feel like this message is the only way to start improving myself. Pent up anger turns into depression. My parents, and S are basically the only people in this shitty world that I feel really care for me. And you've back-stabbed them more times then I've blinked in my life.
 
You want advice from me? I really don't know what. But I can try.
 
- Drop the shitbird boyfriend. He ruined you further then you know, and can make it worse. Your child doesn't need a father in his life if his father is going to be that little boy.
 
- Keep up the rehab. Find a job, no matter how shitty, and train your self-discipline.
 
- Stay away from men in general until you find a new group of friends to be around that doesn't involve the following: Drugs, Alcohol, strip clubs, prosistution, smoking/doing drugs while pregnant and selling heroine to kids. Try dating an actual nerd. I know we're not tanned Jersey Shore alphas who love to party but you'd be amazed on how not shitty we are.
 
- Remember this message, remember its offensive content, feel angry, and prove me wrong. I don't want to be right anymore. I want to be the asshole for a change. Please.
 
That's everything. Frame this on your wall. Show it to your friends. I don't care. I just hope you have the attention-span to read it.
 
In short, you probably already knew how wrongly I felt about you. You are my sister. I wouldn't be typing this out right now if I didn't think I have some sort of feeling left inside this dead emotionless carcass of a body of mine.
 
I'm not going to really give you another chance, this message doesn't have much of a point. I'm afraid I'm past the point of no return. All I'm doing is trying to help our parents in improving you, which they will never give up on. Don't give me a letter back, or speak to me about this because I will deny it. Talk to Mom about it if you want (id prefer you didn’t because it'd upset her), but this is probably the last time for the rest of your life you'll hear anything extensively from me. I'm sorry I can't be a 'better' sibling, but my wounds are too grave for me to trust you any further.
 
Back to the charade, I guess. Boy! I sure love all 3 of my sisters! I would do anything in the *WORLD* for them! Life sure is grand.

You were my absolute best friend since Kindergarten. As a puppy you helped me over my fear of dogs, and as we grew up together you were always there for me. I wish I could say I was always there for you. I know I didn't spend as much time with you as I should have, high school came around and things got hectic. Life got hectic. But you were always there no matter how bad the situation looked. I could always walk out that back door, and the floppy eared Beagle I had grown up with would be there waiting for me. 

I know you'd never understand this, even if you could see it, but I'm sorry. I knew you were old and sick, I knew you didn't have much time left, but I never thought you'd go when I was gone. Alone in a kennel, probably thinking I had abandoned you when you were about to go. To this day, I wonder if you let go because you thought I left you. You had fought every illness for so long, and then when I left... did you lose the will to live? You so rarely left the house, being somewhere like that must have been terrifying. You probably just wanted to be back home on your pillow in the warm sun, but instead I left you to be taken care of by strangers, sleeping in a cage. I thought I was doing what was best for you, I thought you would be safer in the care of professionals. I never meant to scare you, and I certainly would never abandon you. I swear if I knew it was your time I would have stayed by you until the end. You deserved it friend.

I thought we were fine. You said ""I love you"" one day, were quiet and distant for the next two, and broke up with me the next. For whatever odd reason, you thought we could still be friends at that point, and I was desperate to maintain a relationship with you. After 3.5 years, I was honestly thinking we had something that would last many more.

I got wiser. I asked for separation when I realized there was no way that you were coming back. I've wasted too many months thinking I could get you back. And then you get mad at me. Make up your damn mind: do you want me to stay in love with you or not?

Now that you can't talk to me every night, you've taken to flirting with my friends one by one, until one shows he might like you. Lo and behold, you might have found one. All it took was some awkward and obvious flirting (totally unlike your usual personality), making out with my best friend and trying to hide it from me (thankfully HE still has some integrity), and finding someone awkward who would never reject an advance.

Now, as you attempt to form some new relationship on extremely rocky ground, I find myself fighting back my old feelings for you. I've been lied to, I've nearly been cheated on, and you never made me a better person. All you did was give me the false feeling of confidence, one that I should have been able to build for myself, but you were only a crutch. Now, I'm better than that. I'm becoming a person I like, more than I ever should have cared for someone as destructive and fickle as you.

I don't hate the real you. I'm disappointed that the real you isn't the you I knew for the last four years. The real you isn't the girl I fell in love with; she is only in my head.

I know you will never read this but I need to say it.

I love you. I sacrifice for you and I want to be with you. That doesn't change.

I hate where we live. I hate the culture, I hate the weather, I hate the taxes, I hate the language, I hate being so far from my friends and family. I hate the fact that you will not even consider making sure your qualifications will let us leave this terrible place. 

I am trying my best here but it is wearing me thin. There are reasons that I collapse on the floor of the bathroom and sob. I feel stretched so thin. I feel like I'm not living and merely surviving. I am trying to learn the language but you get so angry with my slow progress. I am putting in as much effort as possibly can. I can barely put enough effort into things I enjoy today, yesterday and for months. The depression is crippling me. 

I don't think that you understand that every day when I wake up and I'm still here it is that much harder to get out of bed. I don't think you understand how much of myself I feel like I have lost while I'm here and I feel like I am missing out on my friends and families lives. I feel like I'm missing a large chunk of myself not being with them.

I love you but that is ripping me apart as a person. Eventually I am going to need to end this and I don't know how. I know when I do I will hurt you. I know you want to marry me. I know you love me. I just can't continue to do it here much longer.

The toughest part is I considering leaving you. It hurts too much to leave you. I feel stuck. I hate this place but I would hate to live without you. 

If you would leave with me I would marry you. While I am here I don't think I can every consider marrying you. The idea of being stuck in this place makes me ill. This place is wrong for me and I am wrong for this place.

Shit just got real. You really must not understand who you are fucking with. Let me list the things that I hate about you. 

You are an alcoholic. A lazy, useless alcoholic. Just because you obsessively clean our house does not make you productive. It just makes you really good at cleaning when you're fucked up. You drink and smoke WAY TOO FUCKING MUCH. You try to pretend like you're a productive member of society, but you can't even get out of bed before 2pm. I'm not telling you to not have fun, but you should probably get a god damned job.

This is the first time I have lived on my own. Not with my parents, not with my boyfriend, but with a couple of friends where I can pretty much do my own thing and no one bothers me. Except for you. You bother me all the god damned time. I didn't do the dishes right, or I didn't mop the floor enough, I didn't use enough bleach in the bathroom. Cleaning does not mean making the house sterile. I'm not going to mop the floor for an hour just because that's some arbitrary time that you have decided upon. I'm going to mop it until it's clean. And normal person clean, not ""I'm planning on having a dinner party on the floor"" clean. 

You need to get a fucking job. You are going to jeopardize my very first real life adult thing that I have ever done. And if it fails because you want to be a party boy, I'm going to have to fucking punch you right in the nuts. Multiple times. With a red hot poker. You have been on unemployment for years, it's time to stop drinking and fucking every gay man in atlantic county and GET A FUCKING JOB. I'm sorry that coming out was so hard for you. Man the fuck up. You're almost 30. I'm not letting my shit fail because you have daddy issues. Get a job, or get the fuck out of my house. 

You need to learn how to respect people. Just trying to be happy and positive all the time does not mean that you know how to respect people. You have been a real asshole to the woman who is basically my sister. And that is no longer sitting well with me, now that I know how unjustified it is. So, I may have let this shit slide before, but now that I know the truth about how two-faced you are, I'm not going to be Miss Nice-xteneritasx anymore. Now I'm going to tell it how it is, and I'm going to tell it to your face. Only, I'm an adult and I know that I need to calm down and try to not be an angry bitch before I talk to someone. Unlike you, I'm going to take 24 hours to cool down before I start talking the talk. I mean, you really have no right to be angry in the first place. 

In short: Shape the fuck up, or ship the fuck out. No one is going to hold your hand anymore because every time I do, you spit on it.

I miss the easy, light-hearted conversations, funny texts and such we used to have.  Maybe a man and a woman can't be ""just friends"" since your spouse wasn't ok with it and accused you that it was more.  I'm sad for you that she didn't believe you.  My DH was cool with it....

It's been painful running into to you both around town and having to act like we are all strangers to each other.  It hurts.

I've been on the fence about whether or not to leave us as friends on FB.  You don't ever seem to be on it except on your birthday, and she didn't make you unfriend me (to my surprise).  

You told me we'd have to cool it ""for a while"", but I don't think ""a while"" is what she has in mind.  I think this will be forever.

I did not sleep last night, as I have not slept for the past few nights. I have been struggling with not only my sexuality but also my personal identity, and have been spending my nights up with my computer, pathetically trying to ignore my problems and the people attempting to help me fix them. However, tonight was different. I have always been a fan of your videos, but last night I believe I went through every single one of them. I found something in your humor, your smile and happiness, that has helped me through this ridiculous little crisis of mine. Overnight, it feels as though you've become a big sister to me, the best big sister I could have ever asked for. I am so grateful for every video you've made, every pun you've killed, every smile you've cracked that I cannot possibly explain it in writing. I am also really hoping this doesn't sound creepy because I genuinely think you are a wonderful person and you deserve the best.  
Watching the world wake up to your ""Good morning from Washington, D.C.!"" video was exactly what I needed to realize that all I really need right now are some good friends. And maybe a drink.   
So really, all this is is a thank you. From the bottom of my hart-o, thank you for being who you are. You make a difference with what you do.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1jv6hc,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1jv6hc/to_hannah_hart/,

We had an amazing 3 years together, we did. I know the last year wasn't great and we had our ups and downs, but I thought they were okay. I thought we were going to pull through. I thought we were going to make it, have munchkins, and go forward living out a happily ever after. 

I thought we could be friends afterwards. And so we wavered back and forth between you talking to me and you never wanting to speak to me again. The thing that hurts is that I have no idea what it is that makes you never want to speak to me. I know that we're just friends and I know that being friends with you makes it harder for me to stop loving you. But the fact remains that I do still love you. I still love you. Like moons love the planets they circle around, like children love recess bells. I still love you. 

But when you cut me out like a goddamned tumor and you have the nerve to email me that you never want to speak to me again, that I'm holding you back, that I've held you back, that I wasn't good enough for you. It feels like I'm letting you stomp all over my heart again. The same way that when we were dating, you'd suddenly lose your temper, say mean things, and then stomp all over my heart. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough, that I was never good enough, that I could never ever do the right thing. 

You used to tell me that you knew me so well. I never felt the same way for you. Because sometimes you'd be the most amazing, loving, kind, brilliant person I have met. At other times, your temper gets set off by something innocuous and I am left to deal with the aftermath. I don't feel like I ever really knew you. But now I'm starting to see that you never really knew me. If you knew me, you would know how what you did to me then and what you're doing to me now hurts. You tell me that because I don't show my emotions, because I don't let them control me, because I bury them deep down and stop thinking about them and hope they go away, I don't feel. I don't hurt the way you do. 

Tell me: do you hurt now? Do you hurt the way I hurt? Are you happy now? Are you happier now that I still cry myself to sleep sometimes? That being alone feels so unbearably hard and lonely? Do you understand now? 

You've left me. I'm alone. I'm hurt. I'm crying. And I want you to still love me because I still love you. But I can't make you love me if you won't. ",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1jq3f5,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1jq3f5/i_cant_make_you_love_me/,

I hate you. I hate that you have pushed me to this, but I cannot let it continue.

I hate the lies you've told me just to make yourself look better.  I hate you for calling us names, I hate you for pretending to love us. I hate you for being the kind of mother that would do that.

I hate you for not being able to stand on your own. I hate you for putting another man before your childrens' thoughts and feelings and I hate you for not even allowing me to express them to you before you yelled over me and hung up. And I hate you for expecting us to be okay with that.


I hate you for harassing your youngest daughter the day after giving birth. I hate you for calling her by her abusive fathers name again just to hurt her. I hate you for claiming you blocked her number but continued to text her. And I hate you for confirming all the uncomfortable feelings that I have felt over the years and telling us that you never cared about us anyways.

I hate you for teasing us with fake motherly affection and I hate you for making out like we're your world. And what I hate most of all, was that deep down I knew it all along. It's why I moved 700 miles away to begin with. How is one supposed to call their mother out on being a liar? 

But now that you simply expect me to let you treat me this way, us this way, I cannot let this continue. Your immaturity and drama will only continue to drag us down. This has already given me stomach ulcers.

And I hate that I've been brought to this point but you would know how I felt if you listened or cared.

1375285244.0,15,self.UnsentLetters,1jfd7s,It's been so long since we spoke,tossaway1984,16,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1jfd7s/its_been_so_long_since_we_spoke/,"It's been over 10 years since we met.  You were the first new person that I met on the first day of my senior year of high school.  Me, a scrawny, goth kid but (looking back) reasonably good looking.  You, a perky, bubbly, outgoing cheerleader, gymnast and a social opposite of me, by high school standards.  I sat down and you tapped me on the shoulder and offered me a firm handshake and a somewhat nervous smile.  We exchanged introductions.  I smiled and kinda turned back around, in my head thinking of you as a preppy girl who was having cruel fun with a goth kid.  We kinda sat in silence for a moment before you blurted out that you thought I was really hot.  I grinned and said ""Thanks, you're hot too"".  When I turned to you, you said thanks and were bright red.  The bell rang and you dashed out of the classroom.  I figured we would be nothing more than friends, maybe.  I wasn't even really counting on that.

Instead you became my best friend.  We grew close really quickly.  You would always call out to me in the hallway.  You made a point of yelling to me during a pep rally and waving furiously, despite the odd looks from my other goth friends and your cheerleader friends.  I couldn't take my eyes off you while you did your cheer routine with the rest of your squad.  We answered questions about our relationship to no one.  I quickly learned of your feelings and you of mine.  However, I still ignored you in that aspect for months.  I was afraid of rejection.  I was afraid of losing my friend.

While whining about yet another girl that had made me upset, you yelled at me.  You yelled at me and told me what a moron I was because the perfect girl for me was right in front of me but I was too blind to see it.  You yelled and told me that you wouldn’t wait for me forever.  We became a couple a few days later.  You were overjoyed.  I was overjoyed.  Why had I been so blind for so long?  High school emotions from a hormonal 17yr old boy, I guess.  What mattered was we were together.  We talked even more than we already did.  We spent every ounce of time that we could together.  We talked about our futures, where each other fit into those plans.  We talked about music.  I introduced you to punk rock like The Ramones and The Misfits.  I introduced you to metal like Slipknot and System of a Down.  You integrated it into yourself and found your own tastes in music that I liked.

Do you remember Valentine’s Day?  When you opened a bag of Hershey Kisses, unwrapped them all and replaced the little papers with your own papers that told me why you loved me?  I was so moved.  It was such a beautiful gesture.  I kept those papers for months.  You bought me small gifts.  Nothing expensive, just small things here and there when you were thinking about me.  I cherished them.  I felt so lucky to have such a beautiful (my god, you were so unbelievably beautiful) girl in my life that loved me as much as I loved her.

Do you remember prom?  You were so gorgeous.  I had never seen a girl look so angelic and amazing.  I was in awe at how lovely you were.  You were smiling so brightly.  My mom and your mom were both weeping.  I felt like I was on top of the world.  We waited too late to get a limo so we had a big Cadillac sedan.  Our driver treated us like royalty.  We got to prom and *we hated it*.  Everyone we hated in school was there.  Everyone that we liked was elsewhere.  The music was terrible, the food was terrible, the people were terrible.  The best part of being there was getting our pictures taken together.  You looked so beautiful.  We left like 2 hours early because we were having such a bad time.  Not that we were unhappy, we were happy to be there together and able to make fun of it all together.  We called our driver and she drove us around downtown for about an hour.  Up and down the streets in the moonlight.  We kissed.  We held hands.  She drove us to your work where we went in and had pie and talked to your coworkers.  When our time was up, she drove us to your house were you changed into comfy clothes and then we went back to my house where we got in bed together and snuggled.  I remember you lying on your stomach and I gently rubbed your backside until we both fell asleep.  It couldn’t have been a more magical night for me.

We used to snuggle a lot in my bed.  My parents had split up and my dad was at work a lot of the time so we had the house to ourselves.  We used to snuggle and kiss.  We used to walk around naked, because we could.  You used to walk into my house and just immediately take your clothes off, at least to your underwear.  I loved that about you.  You were so free with showing your body to me.  Never shy or ashamed.  I miss that so much.  Not just because I got to see your body but because you were comfortable with me to do that.

Do you remember the first time you told me that you were in love with me?  I’ll never forget.  We were in my bed (clothed this time) and you said you had to leave.  I held on to you and didn’t want you to go.  It was late and I understood but I wanted you to stay.  You sat down and started to cry.  I was confused, I was worried.  You eventually told me that you needed to tell me something but you were afraid of how I would react.  By your actions earlier in the evening, I had a good idea of what it was.  I coaxed you gently, wanting to hear it but not wanting to force you.  You finally, in the dark room lit only by faint moonlight, looked into my eyes and told me you were in love with me.  I couldn’t have been happier.  I gently stroked your cheek and told you I was in love with you too.  We kissed the most gentle, passionate kiss either of us had ever experienced.  You breathed a sigh of relief and I walked you out to your car and we kissed in the moonlight again…deeply, passionately.

I loved being with you.  I loved “us”.  I loved the way you would wait outside my classes for me.  You would rush out of your class to meet me at mine.  I would come out and you would be waiting.  Your eyes sparkling and your hand outstretched, waiting to lock your fingers with mine.  You would kiss me with a smile and we’d spend those few minutes between classes together.  Even if one of us had a bad day in class or in general, the other was there for comfort.

You were always afraid that you weren’t enough for me.  You remarked several times, mostly at the beginning of our relationship, that you were afraid I would leave you for a girl more of my “taste”.  You knew that all the other girls I had dated were much different from you.  But I reassured you that I loved you and part of why I was so in love with you was because you were different in every way.  You were a breath of fresh air to my soul and my heart.  I never, ever wanted to leave you.

Towards the end of my senior year, small things started to creep up that was a bit hurtful but I accepted them and moved past them because I loved you more than anything.  You didn’t come to my graduation ceremony.  You didn’t come to my graduation party.  You weren’t able to be there on my 18th birthday, though you did make it up to me later.  It hurt but I looked past it.  We continued on our path and I loved you as much as I ever did.  The only real disagreement we had was when you asked me to change some small things about myself.  You asked me to dress a bit differently.  Not wear so much black.  I balked at the request.  I didn’t feel like I should need to change for you.  We had an argument about it.  Looking back, these things were inconsequential requests that I shouldn’t have fought so hard against.

The end of the summer came quicker than we expected.  I got a job at a big name store.  You used to come and visit me when you could.  I loved being able to tell people you were my girlfriend. People were always a bit shocked that me, the goth kid, had such a gorgeous girlfriend that, by outward appearances, was nothing like me.  We thought it was funny.  Soon after, I started my college classes at a local college.  It meant we would see each other less.  You were afraid I would leave you for a hot college girl, which couldn’t have been farther from the truth.  I did my best to reassure you that I would never do that.  I flat turned down girls that invited me over to “study”.  You started back to high school for your senior year.  We only got to see each other a few times a week because of our schedules.  It bothered me but I believed in us.

One night you called me when I was off work and at my best friend’s house up the street from my own.  You said you had something important to talk to me about and you were on your way.  I could tell by the sound of your voice that something was wrong.  I was sick with worry.  I walked home, shaking and sick to my stomach.  I was so scared I was about to lose you.  You finally arrived and you had brought sweet rolls from your work, our favorite snack.  I couldn’t eat.  You finally broke down and told me that when you had went out of town over the past weekend to see an old friend that had moved away that you met a guy.  He had talked to you a lot and he wanted to date you.  I almost threw up.  But then you looked into my eyes and told me that you had told him you couldn’t because you were with me and you loved me.  We spent the rest of the evening in bed and holding each other.  I was relieved but it had implanted a thought into my head that I could lose you.

Our phone calls became less frequent.  You stopped returning my calls when I would call from work.  Sometimes I would sit and call multiple times in a row, hoping to hear from you.  I never did.  I started to really worry.  Sometimes on my lunch break, I would sit in my car and cry because I felt like I was losing you.  I couldn’t bear the thought.  My heart was so heavy and it hurt.  My heart hurt with a deep pain that I had never felt.

While this was going on, a good friend of mine and his girlfriend had broken up.  She had reached out to me online and we had been talking.  Just talking, nothing more.  One night the topic had turned to how I felt about her and if I found her attractive.  Being a typical 18yr old male, I said that I did (which wasn’t untrue, I did find her attractive).  She was more my “type” socially.  We started talking on the phone.  She was telling me to break it off with you and be with her.  This went on for weeks while my contact with you was sporadic.  She visited me at work.  I craved your attention but you didn’t seem to have time for me.  Eventually, between the lack of contact between you and I and her prodding, I decided to break it off with you.  I called you and finally got a hold of you.  I made it quick and said that the lack of contact was more than I could take and we were over.  You sounded like someone had just punched you in the throat.  I could hear the pain in your voice.  It broke my heart to hear you like that.  I picked her up and we went to a restaurant and ate.  My best friend came and sat with us.  After I dropped her off at home, my friend and I went somewhere else and talked.  We talked over things between you and I and I eventually reached the decision that I needed you.  I didn’t need her, I needed you.  I had only felt that what I had done was right because I was hurting and wanted to feel needed again.

I called you the next day from work and spilled my guts.  You screamed at me, you yelled at me, you said terrible things to me.  There wasn’t a name out there you didn’t call me.  I deserved it.  I let you berate me.  Eventually you calmed down and we talked things out.  You apologized for the last short while and said you had been busy with work and school, which I understood.  We agreed to make more time for each other.

Things were magic again.  We were spending time together again.  Things were just like they used to be.  We went places together and spent all our free time together.  We laughed, we played, we enjoyed each other.  I felt like things were back in place.  I was reminded of why I fell in love with you in the first place.  I was so happy.  Truly happy.

Then it all started again.  The phone calls stopped, the time together stopped.  Things were falling apart.  I was scared again.  I spent a lot of time crying.  I needed you so badly.  What had I done wrong?  Did you not love me anymore?  I decided to come see you at work one morning.  My best friend and I drove up to see you.  You looked like a deer in headlights when we walked in.  I was unshaven and I hadn’t showered.  I was a mess.  I was on the verge of tears.  As you seated us at a table, without a word, you turned to walk away.  I grabbed your arm gently and you spun around and looked into my eyes.  I knew something was wrong.  I asked you if we could go somewhere and talk.  You said, coldly, that you were working and you couldn’t but that you would call me when you got off work and we would talk.  I could see in your eyes and hear in your voice that something was badly wrong.  I was shaking.

I went home and, wearily, got ready for work. I didn’t care what I looked or smelled like.  I couldn’t think of anything else but us.  My thoughts were racing about what was going on.  I worried myself sick, literally. I was sent home about an hour before you were due off work.  I called my best friend and he met me at my house.  We said nothing and I waited for your call.  Finally it came.  I answered and we greeted each other.  I went to my bedroom so we could talk.  You told me that things were over.  That you weren’t happy anymore.  I was distraught.  I sat quietly while you told me that you had been talking to that guy from out of town and that because of the way things had become between us that you felt you needed a change.  I begged you not to leave me.  I literally cried and begged you.  But you had made your decision.  I turned the phone over to my friend and let him talk to you.  I was too upset to talk anymore.  He tried his best to talk you out of it.  He knew how much I loved you and how badly I needed you.  I had went back to my bedroom and was sitting on the edge of my bed, hoping for good news.  He came in finally and without speaking a word, I knew that he wasn’t successful.  He held out his arms and I stood up and collapsed in hysterical bawling.  I stood, being hugged/held up by my best friend while I cried my eyes out.  I was devastated.  The one girl I loved more than anyone or anything was gone.

I called you back, still stuffy from crying and told you that I loved you and that if you really felt this was the best, then it was what it was.  I told you that I would always be there for you if you needed me for anything.  You said “OK”.  I told you that I loved you.  You said goodbye and hung up.  I cried more.  Eventually, my friend went home.  I was left alone in my house and I cried myself to sleep.

What happened?  Why did you decide to leave me?  You never gave me a good fucking answer!  I begged you to stay.  I was on my hands and knees begging you to stay with me.  I needed you.  Other than my best male friend, you were my best friend.  I wanted to spend my life with you.  I wanted to grow old with you.  I craved you.  But in seemingly an instant, you were gone.

I started dating that girl that I left you for again a few months later.  We were together for 3 years.  I lost my virginity to her.  But she was never able to take your place.  Inside me grew resentment and an anger that I took out on her.  We didn’t fight a lot but when we did, I was a monster.  I screamed and yelled at her.  She tried to fight back with words but she couldn’t.  Eventually she would grow tired and have nothing else to say so she would leave the room in tears.  The resentment and anger stemmed from the hole in my heart that had been left when you left me.  We would spend the night at her mom’s house every Saturday night.  We would do our “business” there.  After she would fall asleep, I would roll over and stare out at the night sky and cry because I missed you.  I felt like I should be lying next to you, not her.  I cried myself to sleep many nights because you were gone from my life.

I tried to move on the best I could.  We would come into your work now and then.  I loved the restaurant you worked at (to this day I can’t eat at one without thinking of you) so we went there, knowing you would be there.  I think she took a sick pleasure in knowing we would see you.  The few times that you did, you would look at me with pain in your eyes.  You would look at me with such sadness in your eyes.  I know I had the same look.  You always looked like you wanted to say something but you never did.  Why didn’t you say anything to me!?  Do you know I would’ve left her in a heartbeat for you!?  I fucking still loved you more than anyone or anything!!

You emailed me once a few months after we broke up.  We exchanged a few pleasant emails and that was all.  After that, I didn’t hear from you again for years.  I heard from you again when my first daughter was born.  I was a mess from that because I was so young and didn’t want children.  I was forced into the situation because my girlfriend was selfish and wanted a child.  She thought it would save our failing relationship.  It didn’t.  I cheated on her like crazy because I wanted nothing to do with her.  After my daughter was born, I put up pictures on Myspace.  You commented once and said she was so cute and looked like her daddy.  It was the last time I heard from you.

It’s been 7 years now since I heard from you.  I’m married now.  I have 2 other wonderful children with my wife.  Our relationship isn’t perfect but we do the best we can.  I still think about you.  I still miss you.  In those 7 years since I heard from you, I’ve had other relationships that meant a lot to me but none like ours.  My wife is the closest I’ve come to feeling about someone like I did you.  I’ve looked you up on Myspace and Facebook, just to see how you are.  I’ve never contacted you.  I’ve been afraid to.  I was told not too long ago that maybe I should contact you and try to meet with you to get closure.  But I can’t.  I’m scared to death.  I’m scared that if I see you, all the old feelings are going to come back and possibly mess things up with my wife.  I’ve done enough in that department with her, I can’t do it anymore.

I try not to think about you.  I try hard.  Every few months, I’ll have a period where I think about you constantly.  I think about what our life together would’ve been like.  I think about the “What if…?”  I think about how beautiful you still are.  The last pictures I saw of you on your Facebook…you were so beautiful.  You’re not the 17yr old girl that I last saw.  You’re in your late 20s now.  You’re a gorgeous woman.  You amaze me with how beautiful you are.  I’ll think of those pictures and it all wells up inside me until I’m sitting alone somewhere, crying.  I’ll cry and cry and then a little later, I feel better.  And I’ll be ok for a few months.  But then it starts to creep up inside me.  I’ll feel little twinges of pain in my heart.  Soon I’ll be thinking of you for days on end.  I’ll be dreaming of you.  And then I’ll find myself, again, sitting somewhere alone, crying.

I know that you never forget your first true love.  I know that you can never love someone as fiercely and deeply as that first person that you fall head over heels in love with.  But I somehow thought that after all these years that I would be over you.  And I’m not.  I still love you so fucking much.  I’m not naïve enough to believe that things would work with us now.  I don’t think they could.  I’ve changed a lot.  I’m not a goth kid anymore.  I dress how you wanted me to.  I’m in management at my company now and dressing differently doesn’t really fly in my chosen industry.  I’m a very far left liberal and an atheist.  I wasn’t atheist in high school.  We used to talk religion.  You were very confused about religion and I was trying to bring you to Christianity, which I believed in back then.  Last I saw about you, you were a staunch conservative and a Christian.  Not to say that we couldn’t work but I think it would cause at least some friction between us.

I wish I had answers.  I wish I knew what happened.  I miss you.  I love you.  My heart has never mended.  I still have a black hole in my heart where your love used to be.  It’s a painful hole.  Sometimes I can push it down but it always comes back.  It’s a hole that spawns an anger born from pain.  I’m an angry person.  I really try not to be but I am.  I’m angry that I hurt you.  I’m angry that I miss you as much as I do.  I’m angry that, if there is some sort of deity that guides our actions, that that deity took you from me.  I’m angry that you’re not part of my life.  I’m relatively sure you’ll never see this and that angers me too.  It angers me that I’ll probably never have the courage to reach out to you and get the closure that I need.  It angers me that I’m too scared.  I’m too scared of the feelings I have for you after all these years.

I hope your life is wonderful.  I really, truly do.  You deserve happiness.  Even if it’s not with me, it still provides me some tiny, tiny comfort that you’re happy in your life.

My dream is that you could somehow be made to understand how terrible you truly are, and regret it enough to say that you were sorry.  I'm sure you'll say it on your deathbed, because you'll be scared and want support.  You'll do anything, then, just as you'd do absolutely nothing now.

You ruined my credit before I got a chance to even try it out.  You nicknamed me ""blowjob"" when i was *seven years old*.  You told me that you wish you'd never had kids, at one of your grandchildren's birthday parties, and when I suggested that none of this would exist you said ""I could live with that"".

You've smeared me publicly on Facebook, weaving a story that barely connects with reality.  You've written to me privately, just to say ""screw you"" when I tried to help you with your budget.  And you wrote to *my wife* to tell her how stupid she was for explaining to our children that daddy needed support because he lost his grandfather, because you didn't like the grandfather.

You've held an imaginary debt over my head for many years following your mothers death, after she gifted my family with freedom from car payments in the face of repossession and then dropped dead.  I can only assume she was disappointed in you.  I hope to God that she can't see you now as you continue your death spiral into decay.  

To you, I am the cause of all of your problems.  You've ""given me everything"".  You ""did your best"".  Perhaps if you'd done your best I would have finished school.  Perhaps I wouldn't have had to work so, *so* hard to succeed in the face of the ""lessons"" I learned from you.  The lessons that culminate in me feeling small, dirty, stupid and worthless.

You drove my father away, turned my brother into an asshole and you're leading my sister down the dark path into the bottom of the hole where you are.  

Then you called me and asked me for money.  It was devastating to me to say no, but I had to.  I'm sure you wouldn't understand this.  

I've never hated you more, and that is saying something.

When you die, I'll mourn the loss.  I mean, I'm sure I will.  I don't know why I would, but I know I will because I know I'm not a monster like you are.

You were the first woman I truly fell in love with, you were the first woman I shared a bed with, you were my first real companion. It hurt me when you left, it hurt me even more when we finally broke up, and it hurt me even more when you got married and had a little girl. I look at your life now and think, if I had taken a chance, if I had taken the initiative, maybe just maybe that could have been my life. I was willing to give you everything I had and more. You left for reasons that to this day still make no sense to me because it contradicted what you had told me once before. I don't want these feelings anymore. I don't want to keep carrying you with me. I don't want to keep thinking about what could have been and what I could have done to be there, holding you in my arms, carrying around a child that could have been mine, living a life that should have been mine to share with you. There are days where it doesn't bother me as much as it used to any more, then there are days where I just want to world to burn to ashes and leave behind nothing. I'm tired of feeling like this, and I'm tired of feeling like there is no one else out there for me. It's days like this where I find it very hard to keep my promise to you. I promised you that we would always be friends, and it gets harder and harder the more time passes me by because you have a family, you seem happy, and I want you to be happy. But I want to be happy too. Its just so hard anymore when it seems like there is no one out there who will give me a chance. You were one of the first to even do so. You saw a potential in me that it seems most other women never do. I grow tired of all this. Maybe it is time I just give in and learn to live a solitary life knowing that the one that I was meant to spend my life with is now gone. You have told me that there is someone out there for me, I just have to be patient and I will find her. I'm tired of being patient and I'm tired of all the non-sense. Like I said, I have my good days and my bad days, and this is one of my bad days. But the bad days seem to be coming more and more often anymore, despite all the improvements I have made in my life. It's all because you aren't in it anymore, not really anyway, and you haven't been for years. I just want the pain to stop. I don't want to carry you with me anymore. I don't like having regrets in my life, and not taking the initiative and going to see you, even if I had to walk all through Cleveland just to find you, has been one that I have carried all this time.

I was literally the best thing that will ever happen to you, and you threw me away. You've got some really fucked up issues and you don't even realize it. I was never in love with you. I was in love with the idea of someone actually fucking caring about me and LOVING me despite the depression and anxiety. I thought that was you, but you're just a retarded fuck.    
    
Hey. Your ex texted you, huh? The one who cheated on you and got HPV and treated you like a fucking steaming pile of shit? Her? You're glad you have her back as a friend again? Guess what. I DON'T FUCKING CARE. I'M TRYING TO BE FUCKING POLITE TO YOU AND TOLERATE YOUR STUPID SHIT.    
   
HOLY FUCK, MIKE. SERIOUSLY. ARE YOU FUCKING RETARDED? WHAT HAPPENED. I thought you had a BRAIN. You're attracted to all these people who treat you like shit and it's sad to watch. I never wanted to say it because I knew it'd upset you, but you're friends are terrible. I hated them for you because you wouldn't. They don't give a FUCK about what you're doing most of the time, they leave you out, don't keep in contact and you STILL hang out with them? I don't get it. AND THEY'VE ABANDONED YOU ON PURPOSE BEFORE. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM. YOU KNOW THEY'RE SHITTY. GO FIND SOME PEOPLE WORTH BEING AROUND FOR GOODNESS FUCKING SAKE.    
    
GOD. I REMEMBER HOW FUCKING OBSESSED YOU SOUNDED ABOUT EMILY WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING. All you cared about. Another ex and you said you were over her. Didn't sound like it. I think you love people who hurt you and make you feel like you need to come back, need to make yourself LIKED and ACCEPTED by these people who don't give a fuck about your well-being and are just USING you because you're NICE.    
    
But not too nice. Oh, I'm overwhelming? Why? Because I said I loved you and joked about eloping? I DO THAT WITH FUCKING EVERYONE YOU STUPID SHIT. MAYBE IF YOU HAD ACTUALLY ACCEPTED ONE OF MY INVITATIONS TO CHAT WITH MY FRIENDS, TOO, YOU WOULD KNOW THAT. BUT EVEN WHEN YOU WEREN'T WORKING AND ON BREAK FROM SCHOOL, YOU WOULDN'T DO IT. Did you even CARE? I treated you like every other fucking human being on this planet, except that I told you I was attracted to you. OH AND YOU THINK I'M TOO NEGATIVE? I HAVE FUCKING DEPRESSION YOU STUPID FUCKSTICK. THAT WAS LITERALLY ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNEW THAT. AND YOU KNEW I WAS IMPROVING. I AM STILL IMPROVING. No thanks to you, MORON.    
    
My outlook on the world is arguably more positive than yours. I think every human being has merit, even as I'm angry right now. Every single FUCKING one of 'em. And they all deserve love and affection and all the fucking CARE I WANT TO DUMP ON THEM AND YOU KNOW THAT AND I'M SORRY YOU COULDN'T HANDLE IT OR WHATEVER. I don't know where I want to be in ten years. I get upset that I'm not as motivated as a lot of people I know. I don't think that's too negative. That's normal. That's being in college and trying to figure things out.    
     
While I'm at it, let me add some things in so you know how to improve yourself, too.    
    
When your girlfriend says she wants to watch a movie with you, like...once a month, or talk to you on skype you fucking make time for her. I don't care if you're tired. I knew what you'd been doing all day. Just texting isn't enough. She needs to see your face and know you exist for more than an hour a week, you idiot.    
    
When your girlfriend--or ANYONE for that matter--is struggling with a monster, upset, sad you don't immediately make it about you and how you're ""not enough"". It's not ABOUT you. They are telling you because they need comfort, not because they're ready to lay down and coddle you when they're dealing with their own issues.    
    
I'm sorry you're so busy and I'm sorry you think life is so hard for you. It isn't. You live in a nice fucking house and have a great family, so don't give me that shit. You're going to school. Do you know how many people would KILL for that? FOR ONE CLASS EVEN. And you've got a JOB. I'm sorry it's tiring, but I was looking for jobs long before you were and didn't shove it in your face and I'm STILL unemployed. You're fucking lucky so suck it up, cunt, and move the fuck on.    
    
STOP PLAYING VIDEO GAMES SO MUCH WHEN YOU HAVE HOMEWORK. DO THE WORK FIRST, GAMES SECOND.    
    
IF YOU KNOW EATING LATE AND CONSUMING CAFFEINE MAKES YOU SICK, DON'T FUCKING DO IT.    
    
Buy some caffeine free tea for me and drink it when you get stomach aches because I know that happens a lot, alright? Take a hot shower when you need to calm down, too. I know it helps.    
    
Lastly and most importantly, I don't think you want to be friends. I think what you want is the reassurance that I'm ""over you"" romantically. Here it is. I am. So stop waiting. I know it hasn't been that long, but I had plenty of time to think about what we were and what we could've been and I don't think you ever could've been happy with someone being so fucking good to you.     
    
That's fucked up.    
    
I'm sorry for using so many curse words and being mean. I'm angry right now. I mean everything here except for the hatefulness this seems to contain. You're not actually a moron, you just do things that don't make sense sometimes. You're human. I wish you a really great life and I'm glad I knew you. You did help a lot. I was happy with you. I'm not saying I wasn't. I hope you get super fucking old with someone that treats you right and that you're able to love deeply, Mike. To actually be in love with. I know that you definitely weren't with me, not Bec, not Emily either. You just thought so because that's all you have to compare. I'm not trying to say I know all your feelings. I definitely don't. But I do want you to improve with every relationship you go through and to know what does and doesn't work and to not jump and think you're going to get married every time you feel strong affection.

1. 
You were a horrible boyfriend. Horrible. 

The list of things I could make would be endless. 

You emotionally abused me, you self harmed and made me watch, you constantly lied to me.

You sprung the information on me that you might have a child with someone else, while we were sitting on a bus. In public.

You couldn't keep money if it was tied to the end of your dick. I bailed you out of so much debt, I kept us alive when you blew money on every thing you could get your hands on. I earned half as much as you, and you were a greedy fuck and bought everything for yourself. I paid for us to live, you paid for you to enjoy yourself. 

Suggesting we take some time out was a brilliant idea. You and I both knew time out was your pussy way out of a relationship we both wanted to end. 

Yes, I cheated on you, three days before we broke up. We knew it was over and we knew it was coming. I couldn't take your emotional bullshit, your nasty family or your waster ways. I'm sorry you felt the need to spread nasty lies, and rumours about me for years afterwards. 

I really think it's time you let it go though. It's not as though you didn't start sending the feelers out 6 months before we broke up.

2.
I'm sad I once called you a friend. I should have gotten to know you better so I wouldn't be surprised when you turned on me. 

Three days after 1 and I broke up, you were together. To find you sitting on his bed, refusing to make eye contact with me... Why? We weren't together. You didn't need to treat it like it was such a secret. I would have given you my blessing had you spoken to me and treated me like the friend I thought I was to you. 

You're welcome to 1. You two deserve each other. Everything I ever told you about him was true, and you will come to learn it in time. If not, then I hope he's changed, just like I have. 

I hope for the sake of your kids you can drop your petty attitude. I dread to think that in the future, your kids will be a mirror of yourselves. 

3 . 

You. You're probably the worst out of all of them. I knew you the longest, since we were 11 years old. For the best part of 5 years, we spent every weekend together. 

I will never know, or understand why you felt the need to side with them. I have never done anything to you, and if I did, it certainly wasn't on purpose. You were my closest friend, I told you everything. And then you'd tell them.

And I KNOW it was you who was feeding them information about my premature birth, twisting everything. You're the worst one, because you used an innocent child to hurt someone. An innocent child you'd never met, never even once laid eyes on, beyond a photograph. 

You said I'm a bully. I'd like to know who I'm supposed to have bullied. Who I'm supposed to have manipulated. You knew me best, and you knew it wasn't in my nature to do those things. 

4.
You and I were close. 

I probably could have fallen in love with you. I don't understand why you would side with the others. I did nothing to you. I did nothing to them.

You took everyone else's word, and went with it. 

5.
And you. Everyone knows you're a pathological liar, and yet they swallowed your stories about me like it was coming from Jesus himself. 

Shame on you. That's all I have to say. I am never letting you back into my life. I know better than to trust anything you say.

And 6.
You were like my brother. You were the closest male friend I had, even though you creeped me out by constantly staring at my boobs. 

You knew me so well, and you sided with them. You knew better than to just go with it it. You knew I was nothing like they were describing me as. But you dropped me anyway. 

Out of all of their nastiness, your switch hurt the most, because you knew me for me, and you never once asked me if any of what they was saying was true, you just took it as fact, and publically called me out, and when I tried to defend myself and others stepped in, you called them my ""cheerleaders"" and my ""reinforcements"" like I'd hired them to help me out. 

They were people who genuinely wanted to speak up for me. They were people who were doing the job you should have been doing for me against the others. Yet you didn't.

*ALL of you, I would have taken a bullet for. I would have walked to the end of the earth. Everything you didn't do, I would have done, for you. I never spoke a single bad word against you, even when you were constantly harassing me. I never sent out stories of my own, to get my own back, I just sat back and took your horrible lies. If I was a bad person back then, I had no idea, but I'm deeply sorry. I'm not that person any more, the same as perhaps you are not the same as back then. But now is really time to drop this shit. And move on. We don't move in the same circles any more, we have nothing to do with each others lives, and yet the same stories are circling, more than 7 years later.

We aren't a family of talkers, are we? We much prefer to make rude jokes and change the subject. So we don't address Ed's anger problems, we don't address Mum's complete and crippling lack of friendship skills, we don't address my chronic depression. And we don't address your alcoholism.

Because that's what it is, when you have a pulmonary embolism at the age of 22 because you got a blood clot in your leg, and you have a blood clot in your leg because you broke your foot falling out of a doorway, and you fell out of a doorway because you got so drunk you couldn't stand properly. And now you're  on warfarin, and although you hide it better, you still won't stop drinking.

You're going to die if you don't stop. You're twenty three and you look ten years older after you've been drinking.

Living with mum is not helping you, it's not helping your physical or mental health. She will silently encourage you to ruin your health so as not to make her feel lazy.  She will criticise every adult decision you try to make because she wants you to be reliant on her. She doesn't want you to grow up, and if that means buying in the vodka and drinking with you, that's what she will do.

I really want you to go to the doctor ON YOUR OWN, without mum, so that you can tell him how you feel, instead of mum telling him how she wants you to feel as if they are one and the same thing.

I really want to you seek out some of your old friends, the ones who don't drink until they vomit, and spend some time just being 23. Go on holiday WITHOUT MUM. Go into town WITHOUT MUM. Do anything, anything at all, without mum, because although I do not doubt that she she loves us all in her own way, she is a fifty nine year old four year old, and her behavior is poison to anyone who expects her to act like an adult. She's great, as long as you treat her like a giant four year old, and that means don't let her encourage you to stop taking warfarin, or avoid anti anxiety medication, or continue smoking. 

But most of all, above all, if you do nothing else in this world, please stop drinking, because you are such a beautiful person when you aren't drunk or hungover.

You paused, and then said, ""[My name], you are the funniest guy I've ever met. I remember you from [class we had] last year.""

This blew me away. I was already in a rut to say the least, and the loss of our friend hit me hard although I refused to show it. For the first time in years, I felt like crying. Although I played it off with a joke [I know it sounds inappropriate, but the mood had changed], it hit me harder than you may have realized. I went to bed that night with a smile on my face for the first time in a long time.

Thanks for being a light in everyone's life. You helped me and many others through one of the toughest times in our short lives.

i still remember the last time i talked to you. i never imagined that would the last time i talked to you. it was the last day before march break. it was such a simple conversation ""do you have any plans this break?"" ""not really just gonna hang out with people. you?"" ""same. lets hang out over the break."" we use to hang out so much throughout high school but in grade 12 we didn't talk as much. it's not anything bad, we were still good friends. we just hadn't hung out for a couple months. two days later you died. you drowned/froze in that lake. 
you were a great friend. you dated my best childhood friend for 3 years. you were such an amazing friend. i wish i could express myself to others. i wish i could show you how much i miss you. because i think about you so much. i went to go visit your grave last week. it really annoys me how when you died people that you never even talked to act all sad and claim that they were your bestfriends. BULLSHIT. they're stupid heartless attention seekers that want people to feel bad for them. i honestly don't even understand their logic. i don't get what they would get out of saying you were close friends when you weren't. it really made me angry. i often wonder what things would have been like if you were still here. you wanted to work with kids that had autism. you were great at it. i remember you would work at different day cares over the summer. and you were so passionate about it and you loved it. i wish you never left this world. i worry about your family a lot too. although i haven't talked to them in a while i get the sense that your family has been broken apart. your brother moved to toronto and it seems that he doesn't wanna talk to anybody here anymore. at least it seems like it at least but i really hope i'm wrong. it's weird, you passed away at 18 and for the rest of my life, that's how i'm going to picture you. i'm never going to know what you look like when you're older. in my mind, you're always going to be 18. i don't know if that makes sense but i hope you know what i mean. 
i worry about your family a lot. i wish i could do something because i know it has been really tough for them this past year, but i just don't know what to do or what to say. i saw your dad at tim hortons one time and i didn't even say hello. he didn't see me but the guilt built up on me. i don't know what to say! i don't know how to express myself with these things. i can't cry, i just get depressed. i still don't understand why you would have to leave this earth. three months away from finishing high school. i didn't feel right. it still doesn't. 
i never see shane anymore. our friendship grew apart as we got older but he lives right around the corner from me. again, i worry about him. he was my bestfriend for many years. like your family, i worry about him too. he probably doesn't know it but i do. we haven't talked that much in years but i hope he knows i love him as my best friend. i miss you so much. i don't know how to end this. just know that this is the most i have talked about it in months. i think about you all the time and i will never stop missing you. you were a great friend.

I realize it's been a really long time since we've spoken last, and even longer since we've been in the same room together. I think the last instance I saw you was in an embarrassing haze at Rebecca's house, years ago.^1

I have not organized these thoughts- but I'd like to get them down on paper, whether or not I decide to mail this letter.

I always liked you. That's an innocuous enough statement, isn't it? But in 7th grade I felt depressed when you went out with Dave ^2, and... 9th(?) grade, Scott (or was it Ben?). 
Of course, I was a kid, and have always been the jealous type..
The one time I asked you out, you told me I tried too hard.^3
That stung...
And yet, you seemed an impossibly deep, compassionate person that I would have given anything to get to know.
I knew that if I had the chance I could share something meaningful with you, but the chance never came (then you moved away.)

To me, it seemed rather unresolved- a young woman who seems to^4  good to be real dances just out of metaphorical reach, for years, and I- with no experience of love or the American lifestyle, coming from overseas- could never explain myself and how badly I wanted to know somebody like you.

^5

What was I looking for? Compassion, understanding, intellect, a sense of humor, athleticism, creativity. Many things.

You're a Calvin &amp; Hobbes kid. I sensed something special in you when I learned that.^6

You have probably asked- if you've read this far- ""why should you bother writing all of this now? It's been years since we've corresponded.""
That is a valid question, to which I can only reply with honesty.
I still have not met anyone as intelligent, attractive, charming, witty, ambitious, creative, or interesting as you.

My brother gave me a piece of advice that has held true in the strangest way, he said
""If you want something to change in your life, 
                         do something you've been putting off.""

I tried, in vain, to get ahold of you via Facebook, but even that seemed like an exercise in futility. I hope this letter finds you, as one of those ""things I've been putting off"" included telling you all of this.

I don't expect anything in response to this pseudo-confession, given that you're busy enough with your own relationships, work, etc.
--

I keep having these dreams in which I see you.. and your smile.
I can't explain it exactly, but I feel as though you're still very significant to me, even as far(?) away as you are.

I understand that this is really... unsubstantiated, unrequited, etc.
Writing it down seems like the best way for me to come to grips with the fact you have a very different life, and path, to follow, and I have likewise.
Please don't think unkindly of me; I understand if you use this letter to line a birdcage or start a small fire, as I'm sure any rational person who 1. had a bird or wanted to start a small fire, and 2. received a letter like this totally out of the blue, would do.
To sum up, your beauty and wit have always been an inspiration to me.^7

Take care, and best of luck with everything.

When I try to think about the good times, all that comes to my brain is how hurtful and childish you became after the break up. You went out of your way to hurt me many times because you felt that ""you deserved justice"". If I wanted to deal with a self richeous asshole set out to make me feel bad, I'd just stand in front of my step-father and let him spew his drunken hate directly at my face. You are emotionally and mentally abusive when you feel ""betrayed"", and its gross and makes me SO GLAD I LEFT YOU.  You said you wanted to be friends again when ""you were ready to forgive me"". Well, I don't think I can forgive you.

I think I hate you. 

That guy I slept with two weeks after we broke up? He's nice. Him and I didn't work out, and stupid shit happened. I still want to be friends with him though. You don't know him. You've only met him once while I was passed out drunk at a party, and that was months before we broke up. I didn't even remember who he was when we met at the club. HOW DARE you compare him to my friends rapist. Just because he is awkward and can't tell when people get uncomfortable with friendly flirting does not make him anything like that monster. He would never take someone to the park who trusted him, tie a bag over their head, and rape them. 

I cant even believe you would make that comparison to him.

And you contacted all my friends. You told them everything without even letting me get my side of the story in. You are so self absorbed in the pain of the break up that you cant change gears from your one track mind. Yeah I hurt you, but just because you said you were uncomfortable with me going on a date after the break up, and wanted me to slow down, does not give you the right to be angry at who I choose to open my legs for. Two weeks isn't very long to wait, and the fact that it was valentines day had to be salt in the wound, but it does not make me a cheating whore. All it means is that I got over you faster than you got over me. It would have been better if you had never found out, because the sex life of your ex girlfriend should be none of your concern. 

You are a crybaby. You are weak and pathetic. You are petty and vengeful. 

I hope by the next time I see you I have reached my weight loss goal.  That by then I am 2 pants sizes thinner, my hair has been cut and dyed the way I wanted it, and that I look better than I ever did while dating you. That way, it hurts more when you see me. I want you to know that with you out of my life I got healthier, happier, and sexier. I want it to burn. I want you to regret telling my friends that ""the only reason I haven't slept with more guys is because I'm ugly"". I want the thought in the back of your mind to be that you were nothing but dead weight to me.

Holy fuck, am I in love with you.


I think I might love everything about you. I keep trying to verbalize it or write it down and it's all just incoherent gushing. Every time I look at you, it all wells up in my chest and I literally don't know if I want to laugh from pure relief for finally finding you in this big world or cry from joy and disbelief because there's no way I deserve you and there's no way I'm letting you get away.


I'm not afraid of the long distance this summer, but I know I will discover new agonizing reasons to miss you.


I really do love that you're an introvert. I don't think you're quiet or boring, I think you're observant and thoughtful. I love that you can wait for that perfect moment to insert your thoughts or a joke into the conversation and hold everyone's attention. I talk way more than you and I don't think people listen to me half as much.


You're so wise, and you're kind to everyone and you accept people as they are. I don't know how you exist. You're quite literally the man I've been dreaming about my whole life.


Logically, I know you're not perfect. But you are everything I could ever want to love. I feel so lucky that you love me too, but I'm terrified of showing my hand -- how can I tell someone I've known for *7 months* that I know you're ""the one,"" that when I'm with you I feel like the world is one beautiful jazz song, that I know we'll grow old together and drink tea in white wicker chairs, that life is an adventure with you by my side... everything just sounds like a cliche when I try to verbalize it. But I mean every fucking word of it.


I love you so much, and I can't adequately express it, and even if I could I'm too scared of intimidating you with my passion and my intensity and my emotions. I'm so glad that you know I love you, and your love means the world to me. I hope one day we can laugh at this, at me fumbling and flailing to seem cool and ""in-love-but-not-too-in-love"" and failing miserably because I'm a hopeless romantic and way too expressive. I hope it's endearing and cute.


No matter what happens, I am so grateful to have this kind of all-encompassing, deep, gracious love.

I tried to change that when we ran into each other last week, but it became clear to me that you didn't care about helping me figure things out anymore.  We were so close last semester, I did so much for you and you provided me with so many firsts.  I let you know things about myself that no one else has any clue of.  I let you read my journal, my private thoughts.  I put my whole self on the table for you.  But it ended.

We both knew going into it that it was eventually going to end and I accepted that from the beginning.  But fuck me if you didn't do it in the rudest most upsetting way possible.  We were never a ""thing"" I realize that, but how do you think I'm supposed to feel when you move into an official relationship while we were still meeting up?  What does that say about me?  What does that say about YOU?

You were my first hand hold, my first kiss... You knew this, and you were lonely.  You knew how naive I was, how shy I was, how willing to do anything I was.  You could tell I was inexperienced and that if you needed someone to fulfill you physically I would be there in a heart-beat.  At one point I questioned wether or not you were using me, you denied it, but now that everything has ended and the dust has settled I can see how right I really was.

Do you remember that night?  No of course not.  You called me completely drunk begging me to come over.  You kept texting me that you were naked.  Being a horny guy I was over there faster than my now rational self is willing to admit.  You were right, you were naked when I arrived, and I was horny as fuck.  You stumbled into bed and I started fingering you.  I couldn't even make out with you since your breath was so bad.  You started grinding on me and whispering in my ear to put it in you.  You kept repeating how bad you wanted to have it all in you.  Eventually I was naked too and you started to position yourself on top of me.  Your hand reached down to grab my cock to slide it into you.  And for a span of about 10 seconds it was.

You knew I was a virgin.  You knew how much shit I had gotten from people back home about not being relationship savvy.  This was supposed to be a big deal for me.  But this was wrong.  It all felt wrong.  I don't usually tend to bring up religion but I felt an overwhelming message from God or whatever higher power there is that this was completely and utterly the erroneous thing to be doing.

You were drunk, you were not in you right mind, and I was raping you.  If you were sober it would've never got this far, we always stopped before we did.  Yet for about 10 seconds I think it's safe to say I could be considered a rapist.  I was just sliding my penis into a drunken shell of in-cohesive physical want.  And it was disgusting.  I pulled you off of me and you laid there begging me to finish you off.  I left before you even did on your own.  The next morning you called and had no recollection of what had happened the night before.  Good.

I know I did the right thing.  But I am so confused and jumbled up about so many things.  I guess I'm not technically a virgin anymore, but would you even consider that sex...I wouldn't.  But if we're going off of technical definitions alone, in those 10 seconds I gave you my V-card and I can't get it back.  I gave you my virginity and I didn't even get to do anything with that first experience, have any fun with it.  Opportunities with girls don't come around often for me, it still seems crazy to me that you even initially approached me that semester ago.  So I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to be a part of someone else's life again.  In the long run things don't look good.  I realize this, and then I think that I should've capitalized on the opportunity that I did have.  

Sometimes I'll be in class or just lying in bed and I'll think, ""I could've fucked you.""  And the scary part is is that half of those times it's not ""could've,"" it's ""should've.""  ""I should've raped you.""  I hate thinking that, and I want to stop but the thought won't go away.  You didn't remember what happened the day after, I could've just kept going and you wouldn't have even known.  It would've been so easy to do so many things to you, I fantasize about the acts that I could've done and probably never will have the chance to do again.  I've been left so mentally unfulfilled from this whole ordeal that I'm beginning to go insane in my own mind.

When I met you, I didn't know about the cancer, the tumors in your bladder or your anxiety and panic issues. All I knew was that you were forced to quit ballet and go to a university to become a lawyer, or whatever it is you wish to become. 

We became good friends because you assumed the role of a big sister, which kind of fits you well. After all, I'm 7 years younger than you. I didn't need advice, but you gave it to me anyway. I guess I did need someone to tell me that all that drinking and sleeping around wasn't good for me. Thank god I moved past that stage pretty quickly and with no major repercussions. 

The last year has been hell for you. I didn't know much about what was going on with you health-wise, because you chose to live with your other friends. They took care of you, until the whole thing blew up. That's when you came to me. 

I let you stay in my apartment for days at a time, despite the fact that all my roommates hate you. Then you decided to have your mom come visit. I gave her a place to stay too. Did I ever ask for a penny for groceries or accommodation? Of course not, that's what friends are for.

Did I bitch at you for coming to my apartment unannounced on Valentine's day and sitting at the table with my boyfriend and I, for our very romantic dinner for which I spent 50$ on ingredients? Of course not. You were panicky and in the verge of an attack, so no. I wouldn't do that to you.

What about when my roommates asked you until when you were staying, did I bitch at you for being aggressive and saying ""do you really want to kick out someone with cancer?"" 

No. Because the scope of my reasonable imagination is far beyond capable of understanding what having cancer is like. The thing is, though, you have been in remission for over a year. That is something to be grateful for, and not something to use to your advantage or to make others feel bad for asking something they are entitled to ask. 

Have I complained to you about the billion times I have had to stop working on my thesis because you burst out in tears in my living room for 2 hours without stopping? I haven't even told you about how my roommates ask me ""what is wrong with her, who died? why is she ALWAYS crying out in the living room?"". It bothers me. It bothers everyone in this house. 

Now, very conveniently, one of my roommates had to move out. Did I bitch about you going to her directly and not asking me before, to see if you could move into her room? No. 

Did I even tell you I was planning to use that room for when my sister comes over for my graduation? No. We can afford a hotel, but you can't afford an apartment. So I didn't even tell you that.

I don't have a point. I'm not gonna kick you out. But if you could please, stop smoking my cigarettes and eating my fucking pop tarts, milk, tuna and the rest of my groceries, it would make this whole thing less terrible. You know, terrible for me. Because you NEVER stopped to stop and think, ""how is this affecting her? how much time is she wasting on me while she still has her dissertation to write? how much money is she spending on feeding me?"" 

What I hate the most, is that I know that I'm not helping you in all these ways out of kindness. Kind people don't bitch and complain and bottle all these feelings up. Kind people don't feel these things. I'm angry, I'm frustrated, and honestly I think I'm only doing this out of pity. You don't bring anything into my life that I need, and I honestly wish I could just have the last month before graduation for myself without having to take care and listen to your endless line of problems. You make me tense, stressed, you bring me so much frustration.

I really hope you become whoever you want to become. I really hope that you can learn to be an adult. I really hope you don't put anyone else through this.

I know I'm not the mother you deserve.  I had all these expectations of what it really meant to be a mother.  And I have failed those very expectations over and over.  I thought I was doing what was best for all of us by staying with your father, but now I see I was too comfortable in the situation to change things.  I was too afraid to be alone, without him there even though he was a terrible husband and father, to leave him.  

When you both were born, I wanted to be the type of mom that cooks, cleans, volunteers at your schools, reads bed time stories at night.  But I'm not...that's just not me.  I hate myself for not being better and for not putting you guys first sooner.  I'm not a terrible mom, but I'm not half the mom I could be.  

Everyday I live, I'm simply trying not to screw up your lives as much as I've screwed my own up.  Will you have emotional trauma because of me, because I allowed your father to live in our house while he was abusing drugs and me.  

I hope in time you can be proud of me and who I am.  I hope that I can find the man who should be a real father to the both of you, instead of the pseudo dad you guys are stuck with.

I shouldn't have blocked you from the start, because that doesn't really help me heal, does it? It's just a childish move from a still childish girl. So, I've unblocked you. But it's for my sake. It's so that I can look at myself in the morning and know that I'm moving on. That I won't close myself to hardships, but face them instead. And have the courage to realize that I have the strength to not run from them. Not run straight back into you. 

I'm not sure how I feel about you anymore. I'm forgetting the sweet words you used to send me. I'm forgetting why I fell for you in the first place. I could recall them all easily if I let myself, but I won't. I think I realize I must move on. That it's necessary. That, even if you were the *one* for me, maybe you're not the one I'll end up with. 

You'll always be the first person that ever opened my eyes to the big world. You'll forever be my first love and my first heartbreak. My first goodbye. A stepping stone to becoming a mature adult. I will miss talking to you when I'm having a bad day. I will miss making you laugh. I already miss your random questions, your strange humor, your one liners, and your totally bizarre references. 

I don't think there really is anyone else like you out there. You're damned unique... but maybe I am too. So, I guess I just have to realize I'll never find someone like you again. But, maybe I can learn to love something else. Maybe I can learn to be someone else, too. 

I wish we ended up happy together. I wish you and I really ran away together and got married in Mexico. I would have liked that very much... I would have liked to have a whole life with you, but maybe they're just fanciful dreams of a younger girl. We should have realized that it could never work out, right? Too good to be true?

He denied it and said all these pretty words to try and fix stuff but I didn't give in.  I felt like crap, thought I was crazy, and I almost caved a few times.  But finally this morning I got closure from seeing a picture of him and her together.  And let me tell you, I'm 100 times better than her :D (not conceded, she's just a trainwreck all around). 
_

Dear Tom,

It made me feel relieved when I saw the picture of you and her go up.  It was literally the first thing I saw on Facebook this morning soon after waking up, and it made me so happy to finally know and be able to accept that you were cheating on me.  This past week I’ve gone through a rollercoaster of confusion, not knowing whether to trust my instinct or your words.  As you know, I trusted my instinct and thankfully long enough to get away from you and now I’ve gotten my proof.

Yes, it hurts to know you cheated on me.  It hurts more than I could ever imagine it possibly could.  But at the same time I am happy.  Happy and relieved.  My heart is broken but I’m happy because now I know that I wasn’t crazy, and my fear came true.  I knew you were a liar, but you promised you’d never lie to me.  Well now ya have.  You’re a cheating liar.  A terrible boyfriend, and I feel sorry for her but she deserves to have a terrible person like you because she is equally terrible for knowing that we were together but still taking you from me.
So thank you, I guess.  Thank you for proving to me that I am not insane.  Thank you for letting someone else now be able to love me in every possible way that you could not, because you never truly loved me.  You have terrible morals, and I should’ve realized it months back.  But I’m not upset.  I’m not crying or wishing I could have you back.  I’m not going to get angry.  I’m keeping you blocked on my phone, on Facebook, skype, xbox, and everything that you could possibly contact me on.

I hate you more than I can put into words.  But this time, I’m not letting you get to me.  You aren’t going to walk away unharmed, because I know that cheating kills both people.  All I need to do is wait for karma to take its spin.

With so much loving regards,

The girl who gave up so much to be with you but only lost in the end

I suppose it's stating the obvious to remark on how much I enjoyed seeing the pile of *your* books every morning and every evening, for those curious two weeks.  I thought about all the books I owned that I was going to lend you.  I wasn't sure if I should read slowly, and savor what was being shared, or if I should read quickly, greedily, and ask for more.

Obviously, I was too quick.  Too greedy.  I asked for too much.

So now this stack greets me every morning.  It was fine while I was teaching, while I had other things to think about and be distracted by, other things to focus on.  I could push you and this stack of books out of my mind.  I had to.  The most dangerous minutes of my day were on the bus or the train, when I couldn't stop the thoughts from racing.  All I could do was bite my lip, dig my nails into my palms, because I wanted to feel anything else but lonely and lacking.

I graduated.  There's nothing to keep me from thinking about you and this stack.  Now when I roll over in the morning, I see these books.  These books I never got to talk about with you, and it's all I can do from rolling back over and sleeping all day.

I hope someone else gives you books to read, and writes you notes.  I hope she can read your copy of *Norwegian Wood* without relating to Midori.  I hope when you meet her, you aren't afraid.

I hope at some point, you find the courage to do and say all the things you too often keep inside.  I hope you will stop doubting yourself.  Even if it was only for a few short months, you lifted my heart, even when you couldn't lift your own.

 You were my first. I'll never forget it.

I don't want anyone closer and I like you. A lot. And it recently occurred to me that you hadn't expressed how you felt about me. We don't talk much any more. A text every so often. Nothing more.

The silence is unbearably painful.

I've tried so hard to find the key to unlock it; to unlock you. But now, I think I realise I was never meant to have that key. It was never going to be for me.

I think that might be because you're the only one who holds it. You won't let it go; you won't trust, you won't give yourself up, you won't let someone else help you find it within yourself. It's like your past is hot coals you are holding onto whilst I'm stood next to you with a bucket of water - you are the only one who's getting burnt from not letting go.

As soon as things seem too much, you run away. I chased you; I fell down, but I picked myself up and ran faster. But it was you tripping me up the whole time, wasn't it? You didn't want me to chase for as long as I did. You were trying to run away, but your locked door stopped you from saying how you really felt - stopped you from telling me.

So, I'm going to pick myself up one more time. But, this time, I'm not going to resume the chase; this time, I'm walking the other way. You'll still be running, but when you turn back to trip me once again, you'll find I'm no longer there.

Sure, it's not going to be easy. I'll still sit and wonder how you are, but I'm not your emotional punchbag, I'm meant to be your friend. I don't think you really want me in your life, you don't need me. But you need to fix yourself, because no one else can do it for you if you won't let them in. When you decide to fix yourself then all the answers that you need, are lying behind the mask that you wear. Everything you're looking for is right there, you just need to find it within yourself.

My door is still open for you, but only once you've learnt how to unlock yours.

Sometimes you're slightly obnoxious and a little opinionated. You have a bit of a temper and you're a little over-sensitive. You have a tendency to cling, and I know you've got a possessive streak. While these things seem like they should be deal-breakers for me, they aren't. You at your worst is actually pretty tolerable, and I never hold it against you. Sometimes your antics are *frustrating*, but there's never any malice in them, therefore I do not feel threatened. With you, I am able to walk away and cool down and come back feeling no resentment. Do you know how special that is for me? 

You're hilarious, you're kind, you have ambition and you get things done. You're reliable. You're not lazy. You're fairly punctual - you care about not wasting the time of others. You're educated, trying to carve a good path for yourself. I like your family - they make me feel like I've come home, which is important to me because I struggle with feeling that way with my own family. I love that you're tall and slender. I love hugging you and burying my face in your chest while wrapping my arms around your waist. I like the colour of your hair, your freckles and your big, brown eyes. I like how you smell - your cologne, your detergent. I love how you flirt with me. 

You have a special smile that only comes out when you're being sweet to me, and I think I used to tell you about it when we were 12. Do you remember that? I called it your 'cute smile' and I waited eagerly for it every day at school. It's smaller than your usual smile, but it's so sincere. The sweetness comes from the expression in your eyes more than the shape of your mouth... but I love the whole thing. Seeing it instantly brings back memories of standing by B's pool in our bathing suits, staring into one another's eyes nervously waiting for the other to lean in for a peck on the cheek. You would flash that special smile, nervously, and ultimately chicken out... but I didn't mind. Those summers were fantastic, you know. I treasure the time we spent as a couple.

I was talking to E tonight over some drinks on a patio in the city. We talked about love, about old flames. We were sighing about how quickly time has flown, about all the men and women we've had in our beds. How there were some really fun and exciting and new times with equally fun and exciting and new people, but that there was always one romance that we waited around for - I wait around for you, you know. We ended our relationship so long ago, but I have never stopped loving you. I love you as a close friend, I love you in the same way one loves a brother, I love you as a lover. I love you for helping me to love myself when we're together.

You make me feel like 'my old self' again, whatever that means. The combination of nostalgia and gratefulness that stems from the fact that you've remained a close friend for such a long time is overwhelming. It brings me a lot of happiness whenever I'm going through a dark time.

Speaking of dark times, I just have to tell you that I've suffered from near crippling anxiety for such a long time. As the years go on, the anxious feelings seem to get worse. But, like I mentioned earlier, my interactions with you are so anxiety-free. Sure, we may find ourselves having a disagreement over one thing or another, but when I'm having a passionate conversation with you I'm actually able to get angry. Not, like, vicious... just angry. Frustrated. And it's beautiful, you know, because I'm not good at being angry with anybody else but you. Whenever I'm faced with what I perceive to be an unpleasant situation my automatic response seems to be ""curl up into a ball and weep."" When I'm not crying, I'm bottling up important emotions only to unleash them in an inappropriate way later on when they've become irrelevant. I'm too afraid to burden others with my feelings... except for you. You hear those feelings and you let me let them out. If we're grumpy with one another, I know that everything will be okay in the end. You're the only one I feel comfortable expressing my opinions to. You don't judge me, and I love you for it. I feel stronger when we work through tough spots - that's a very rare and special thing for me. You have no idea.

We're hanging out tomorrow, and I'm happy. I'm going to travel to your apartment and sit and talk with you. Maybe we'll take a walk, maybe we'll order pizza. I don't know. What I do know is that the entire time we're together, I'm going to fantasize about leaning in for a kiss. About what it would be like to position myself on your lap and run my fingers through your hair. About how close we are to your bedroom, and how much I'd like to be under the covers with you. I'm certain I could show you a *really* good time.

That's all I wanted to say, but this will never reach you. Instead we'll carry on as we always have - as friends.

Love,

A.

You don't seem to want anything but me to watch you wallow around in your depression and try to fix you. I'm pretty sure when it comes down to it, we both know that *I can't*. I can't help you at all, I can't make you happy, I can't understand why you decide you still love me every once in a while and fuck everything up again. I wish I could, I really do, but we're being stupid if we're clinging to that as a central point of hope. You need help. Probably from a doctor or something. I wish you'd tell your parents, or your brother, or your therapist, or *me*, even, because I don't know what's going on, and I can't help, but I'll listen if it makes you feel any better.

I loved you. I loved how happy you were. I loved talking to you, and when I couldn't talk to you I loved writing you letters. I loved how you wrote songs for me. I loved playing with your cats and talking to your parents. I loved the silly plans for the future we made and the silly names we were going to give our kids. I loved listening to the mixtapes you'd make me- I loved that someone would do that for *me*. None of the pretty girls ever got a mixtape, but *I* did. You made me feel pretty. You always told me I was. Sometimes I still see it when I sit in the sink and stare into the mirror. Sometimes I just see the angry little girl who made you cry all the time, and I decide we're better off apart. Just I finally get used to not having you around anymore, you show up and forgive me for everything, and we go on like nothing happened until I make you upset again and you leave. 

I don't want to give up on you. I never wanted that. I want to hold your hand and pretend like I'll help you get through this, but I don't even know what the fuck *this* is, you won't tell me. Is it her? I know you don't love me as much as you love her. It kills me that you still talk to her with that little spark of hope she might love you one day. I might not be good enough, but we both know she'll never love you like you want her to. I wish she did, if that would make you happy. I wish you would leave me alone and never talk to me again if it made you happy. You say that would make it worse, but would it really? You leave me to be on your own for weeks and weeks, but you still love me when you get over it? And you count on me to not have moved on every time? It's really wearing thin. I don't know if I still have any love for you left. I don't like feeling like a crutch, especially with this overbearing arc of things you do that show how little you actually care for me nowadays. I know I feel bad for you, and I know I want to help you, but is it because I love you or because I know I might've fucked you up in the first place?

I don't know anything. You're older and smarter and less stable and like pretending I'm some wise god with all of the answers you're looking for.

You are well known, you have fans, but that does not mean you are everything you seem to be.  You are an abusive fuck.  You hate your mother and this should have been my first indicator to run fast and far. You came on so strong. It was romantic and brave the way you moved across the country to be near me 3 weeks after we met. But that was all a farce too. You and all your little toys; the fake world you've set up for yourself. 

You called me stupid, told me I was ""small town"".  I want you to know no matter what amount of fame you acquire, you will always be the guy that locked me in a bedroom, and threatened to stab me with scissors.  And you will always be miserable, because thats exactly what you are; a miserable little cuntboy who pisses sitting down and blowdrys his hair.  You preening little, self-important, cuntboy. I hope you rot in your eventual unhappiness. Everything you have, you will destroy because of the way you treat everyone you know.  You spew hate about all your friends to anyone who will listen. You respect no one, and in turn, eventually, no one will respect you. 

I was endlessly forgiving, justifying of your behavior. I allowed you to belittle me in front of our friends, use me, take over my home, and alienate me from all my friends. 

Here's a quote I'm sure you know:

""You see, it's the slow knife, the knife that takes its time, the knife that waits years without forgetting, then slips quietly between the bones. That's the knife that cuts deepest.""

* A stupid hookup.
* A *fantastic* hookup.
* One of the best friends I've ever had.
* The strongest person I've ever met. Maybe will ever met.
* That weird girl that people either love or don't want anything to do with. But just because you were weird didn't mean it bothered me.
* Cut from the same cloth as me.

I can't... I don't even know where to start. I wish I'd started keeping count of the nights I've either slept less than five hours or not even bothered trying to sleep since you died. For a month after, between you and the one year of Papa's death, I was running as hard as I could until I passed out. I fell asleep during class, in the car with my mom, hanging out with friends. It was a month of seemingly spontaneously contracted narcolepsy. As if narcolepsy could be caught.

You lost a brother and a dad within a few years, and you were so young. Not too young, though, definitely old enough to remember it, for it to hurt and to haunt. I didn't know your dad too well, but Eddie was my friend, too, almost an older brother. I know how that hurt, little one. You started doing heroin just like him, but you beat it. I was so proud of you.

Okay, but negative shit and problems and we had sex. Whatever, that shit isn't important. You saw me as some kind of bastion of fortitude, you told me everything. It didn't matter that you knew better, and that you were the one that held my hair back that time I threw up because I couldn't deal with something. It didn't matter that you were here when Hell told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore, again. I was always strong when you needed me to be, even though I started to go a little crazy the last month or so that you were still here.

And, damn, that last month. The first time at the hospital. Not fun. That was so stupid. I was mad, yeah, but I didn't let it show, or at least you didn't say anything. You didn't die, and that was what was important. I was so scared.

The second time. Sleeping in a chair every night for two weeks so your mom could sleep at home. Not fun. Not comfortable. Having to walk that day it was snowing was also not fun, and the semi-naked cuddles in the hospital bed weren't all that better. That bed was almost as uncomfortable as the chair, Jesus Christ. Two weeks of hell.

But that last night that I came up there. You asked me if I would cuddle with you, and I did. And you held my hand while you fell asleep, like you always did. You told me you loved me. I couldn't have meant it more when I told you the same thing.

And then the next day your mom called me. It was raining, and I didn't think to get in the car right in front of me. I told her I'd call her back later. Sat in the driver's seat with the door open for a while, being cold. I went numb before I even sat down, so fuck it, right? And then I bumped into her later, because I had to go get stitches because I'm stupid, small world, huh?

It's almost 5:30 now, and thankfully it's still summer, and a Saturday. I can sleep all day tomorrow if I need to. This isn't the first time this has happened, and it's probably not the last. The last couple years haven't exactly been the best, but I can deal with that, I guess. Nothing's bothered me too bad so far. Except you. I can pray to every god supposedly in existence, I can scream until my throat bleeds. I've learned sad songs, angsty songs, happy songs. Doesn't make any difference. Guitar, bass, drums, singing. Alone, with a few people, at a party making a fool of myself (but not really). 's not a chord or a word or a chorus or a verse or a beat that can stop the hurt. And it's beyond my way with words.

I tried to like what you all liked, I kept quiet when you all destroyed things at the playground to be 'cool' and even kept quiet when one of your threw rasin boxes at a woman's car because you disliked what she gave out to us on Halloween.

It's funny how I took you all in with your faults and everything but you never once did it for me. I wonder why you did that, considering you kept the liar of the bunch so close while you were slowly pushing me away every single day. I didn't notice it at first, but now I do. 

She would say a lie and you would laugh at it and then I saw you would stare at me for not laughing and just ignoring her. Well, it was a lie, why would I give it any thought? So she could feel like she was manipulating me like she was with all of you?

Oh and then there's the best part of them all, isn't there? 

The one time I needed all of you there for me and you were all gone. You believed her when she said I was lying about my surgery. 

Yeah, because my parents would be so willing to back up a lie by letting me stay home for a month from school. 

The look on your faces when I came back and you saw it was the truth was enough for me to figure it out. You looked at me in shock, and then you looked over at her and instead of her actually saying she was sorry for the lie and all of you asking me how I was, you were quiet. 

Didn't say a single damn word to me. I sat down on my own slowly trying not to bend my leg because god forbid any of you offer to help me.

Only person that helped me was the one person I didn't think was a friend. They visited me when I was recovering and brought me books to read and stayed around for a few hours after school to keep my company.

Never saw any of you.

Then time went on after the whole surgery business and I would show up to the table and you'd all get silent. Look at me, look at her. 

Then I stopped showing up and started staying with them because they didn't judge me. Never told me I was stupid or that I was annoying. They never rolled their eyes at me about the social worker coming to see me every other day.

Finally we graduated and we went our separate ways. And what do you know? She turned on every. single. one of you.

All of you. 

Blamed one of you for having drugs in your dorm.

Another for harassment.

The list of her lies go on.

I wonder how it felt to see someone believe her lies over what you were saying? Did it feel good? Because karma is a bitch and it really came back to bite all of you right in the ass.

Especially the liar. You got it the best. You lied so much that when you were finally caught you had no one to pin your little antics on. No, you got caught and kicked out of University. Twice.

As for me, I am studying hard, got all the help I needed from the social worker and my therapist. Can you believe that once I was away from all of you that I got better? So much better.

Yeah, I'm doing great right now. As for all of you, I hope it was a wake up call. No, I don't want you to come up to me and apologize with a sob story about how you've changed and want some closure.

Keep that. As of right now, once I hit submit, all of that is gone. I never knew any of you. I won't even think of you guys as anything more than a stranger on the street or sidewalk. Because thats all that you are and will be to me. Nothing more.

Not just a want, but, a real physical need. I feel a strong urge and desire to tell you I love you and that no matter what I am there for you in whatever way I can be. I find myself searching for the words to tell you how much I love you but none of them seem sufficient.

I am so afraid that you are hurting deeply beyond just our breakup. I want to make sure you are okay. I wish that you would open up to me and tell me what's happening. I think that perhaps it's difficult to articulate what's wrong because it may feel like everything is wrong. I've been there, I understand that.

I wish that I could just do something to try and comfort you or ease your pain. I hurt, but, before I focus on that I want to ensure you aren't hurting. I want to help you to find peace and happiness, then I will focus on me.

I want to remind you that I love you completely and am here for you if you need me and want to talk even if it isn't about us. However, I don't want to push you away with how intensely I love you. I read somewhere that if you love someone, but, they aren't in a place to accept that love it can actually drive them away. I don't want that.

I miss just holding you more than anything. Waking up in the middle of the night and not having you next to me causes a moment of panic and then heartbreaking sadness. I love you so much and hate that we can't be together, even if it is what's right for you. I know that this is what you want and need for you though. It's just so hard to accept when it's the last thing I want.

I miss the way that way you would furrow your brow at me for acting stupid. I miss hearing about what silly things your kids did that day or what funny thing you observed our goofy pup doing.

I want to analyze every aspect of our relationship and apologize for so many stupid things, but, I know that isn't productive. I know that we were deeply in love at one point and extremely happy at one time. Things like laundry or where things are kept seem so stupid and trivial now. Why in the world would I get upset about a toothpaste cap not being on or the order in which we did yard work? Stupid.

I don't know how or why the love for me left your heart, it hasn't left mine yet. It is hard to imagine that it ever will. Part of what makes this all so extremely painful is that I know in my heart that you wouldn't do this unless you absolutely felt you had to.

There is a part of me that wishes I had never dated you at all just to save myself from this hurt. However, I know that I wouldn't want that. I wouldn't trade a single moment of our time together for anything else in the world. It was special and absolutely made me a more complete happier person. You made me feel so special and loved. Better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all, right?

It is my most sincere hope that you too felt loved and cared for by me. I hope that you never felt taken advantage of, disrespected, or that I didn't care.

You are the most important person in the entire world to me and I want you to have all the things in life that you desire. I've never wanted to hold you back, because, how could I? It would be a futile endeavor. You're one of the smartest and most driven individuals I know. If you want something you work hard at it and get it.

I wish you just needed time to think rather than suddenly be so over me and want me gone. I love you and always will. 

I don't know how to stop wanting you to be in my life. I want the joy of waking up with you and the comfort of kissing you goodnight and holding you as I fall asleep. I don't know how to turn that off or feel different. I wish I did.

The unfortunate truth at the root of this is that you just don't feel for me what you once did. I need to learn and accept, and I will someday, that no matter how much I love you it won't make you love me back.

We, to so many people, represented love and a friendship and relationship based on love. I hate that for whatever reason that feeling left you. I hurt knowing that you hurt.

People keep telling me that now I can start making decisons for me now, but, I don't want that or even really know how. I feel like all the decisions I have made have been to help us build the life we wanted together. I never felt like I wasn't able to be myself or pursue goals because I was with you. I felt encouraged to reach my full potential and I hope that you felt the same way. You never held me back or limited me in any way. You were my companion and friend that helped me move along the path of life and grow as a person.

I hurt that I can't be there to help you or just make sure you are okay. Its against every natural instinct I have to do nothing when I know you are in pain or unhappy.

Do you know how much joy I get from seeing you happy? It made me happier than anything else in this world. Your face lighting up, your laugh...they made me so unbelievably happy. You love things in such a special way and see so much beauty and wonder that sharing your outlook on the world is something I found to be so special. I'm grateful for every moment I got to look at the world through your eyes and see all the beauty, splendor, and joy that surrounds us. I'll never doubt whether or not that was special or that I loved it and you.

I still believe in the potential and possibility for us to have a loving relationship that makes us both very happy.

Nothing good in this life comes easy and when I think about the long hard path to a happy life there isn’t anyone else in this world I want at my side as I walk down it. I want you to be my lover, my best friend, my foundation, the mother of my children, and my partner and teammate to take on all the struggles &amp; victories, pain &amp; sorrow, joy &amp; happiness that come with life. I find strength in you to do the impossible, you bring out all the best parts in me and make me feel whole, you’re my rock, my foundation. You're a calming presence in a world of chaos and confusion. You give me hope for the future and help me to see all the beauty and splendor in the daily world. I trust you with everything and hold nothing back from you. When you hurt, I hurt and pray that I can take away every ounce of pain you have. You are the smartest and most beautiful person I’ve ever met and I want to spend every possible moment of the rest of my life with you by my side. (that previous paragraph was part of my proposal that I had written)

That is a difficult thing to let go...

But, you didn't just end our relationship. You ended it to be with someone else...one of my best friends. You feel that I didn't respect him, and I certainly don't now. But, things I told you, my frustrations with him, were because it is painful to have a friend you believe to be so self destructive. Its painful to try and be such a good friend to someone for so long and not feel like that is ever appreciated or reciprocated. 

What caused us to grow apart? How did I not see it or know it until it was to late? If you truly loved me why didn't you recognize this and try to refocus on our relationship? You say that you did try to work at our relationship, but, how could you be giving that your efforts while developing and deepening your relationship with him? I know you don't want to call it a relationship, but, when you spend so much time with someone, are emotionally invested in them, and sleeping with them... That is what it is, a relationship. You can call it what you like, but, don't try to completely lie to yourself.

When you say you are sorry are sorry for what you did or just sorry I found out? Are you sorry you hurt me or are you sorry that people are going to see the real you? Is this the real you?

Don't you owe it to me after all the years to at least try to work through things or communicate your worries and concerns to me so that we could have the opportunity to work on them? After all I've done for you (and you've done for me) and the life we were planning don't you think I deserve better than this?

You say you tried to work through things with me and talk to me about them. You said you tried to reconnect with me, but, the whole time you were having an emotional (possibly more?) affair with him. You can't be focused on us and be building a new romantic relationship with someone else. How could you be devoting yourself to trying to fix things in our relationship and at the same time be pursuing a new one? You can't be emotionally focused and invested in both.

Did you not feel comfortable talking to me about them or even acknowledging the things growing in your heart? Did you leave to pursue a potential relationship with him? Does he offer you something I lack or can not give? Do you crave instability or is your self confidence so demolished that you must have your self worth and value defined by what someone else tells you? That is heartbreakingly sad. You shouldn't need that, you're better than that.

I know that he can offer a great deal of emotional support, but, what beyond that? Part of the reason he is so available is because he doesn't have anything going on in his life, so, he is able to devote every waking moment to you. Not to degrade that in any way, but, do you not believe I would offer suppport to you too? Did you think I didn't care? Do you not know that I would give you everything and more? You weren't getting emotional support from me because you were blocking me out and not opening up to me. I can't be there for you if you don't let me in.

Why won't you at least give it a chance? Life is long and we can slow down. It doesn't have to be an end. It could be a beautiful beginning of something new and better, part of me still believes that. Night is always darkest before the dawn, no?

I wish that this was just a break and we could try starting anew. I believe we could work on things while rekindling the love in our relationship and in our lives. It's still there, I know it.

However, it's impossible and naive to think that our relationship can be what it once was. While you may not have technically cheated on me it still feels the same way. Do you not see how I would feel that way? How can you put someone you once loved through this?

It is getting harder to think that you love me or ever did. You slept with my once friend not even 2 weeks after breaking up with me and forcing me to move out. We were together for nearly 5 years. That's fucking cruel. Did I hurt you in some way that has motivated you to act this way? What was it? What did I do?

It's hard not to feel sick I hurt so badly. I still don't understand why you don't want to try and work at things. Relationships are difficult, they are always going to take work. Love for the other is what carries you through difficult times, it sustains you. Knowledge of what can be, if you work at it, provides strength through trying episodes.

Did he poison your mind against me? He said, when I spoke with him, that he wasn't sure if he loved you or wanted to be with you but he couldn't let us be together. What is that? Why? Who even thinks that way? You may choose not to believe it, but, surely you must see that he doesn't truly have your best interest at heart. His acts are selfish and uncaring. You may look at what he has done as bravery and courage to speak as to what he says is in his heart, but, you will eventually grow to see that he is only motivated by his own most immediate wants and desires. He doesn't care who he hurts or the consequences of his actions as long as he can get what he wants. He isn't capable of looking long term and is only focused on his wants in the here and now. This isn't new, look at how he has lived his life the last 6-7 years. Do you honestly believe that he is unselfish and caring? Do you think that he truly has a good and decent character at his core? 

Maybe you prefer someone like that. Never thought you would, but, actions speak loudly. You even said yourself: ""I don't want someone stable right now.""

He has been willing to destroy nearly every friendship that he has just to get something he wants right now and may not want at all in the future. How do you not see that as a lack of character, ethics, and integrity?

He told me that he only saw three outcomes from all of this.

He gets you and I lose out on you and lose all my friends.

He doesn't get you, you tell me, he loses all his friends.

You both never speak of it again and he is in my wedding and I live life blissfully unaware.

How do you not see that as selfish? I know you talked to him about problems in our relationship... You didn't talk to me about those things. He saw that as an opportunity to intervene and get what he wanted from you. Which I believe was to sleep with you and then have our relationship. He got at least one. But, he can't have the other because he won't ever be me. How can you not see that he is motivated by selfish desires and jealousy?

He can't have OUR relationship. It can't be the same because he isn't me. His love for you won't be as pure or unconditional. It won't be as true and steadfast. I may not have handled day-to-day things very well, but, you know deep in your heart that I loved you and wanted the absolute best for you.

If you didn't see that then you are the only person that knew us and didn't see it.

I wish that you would give us a chance. There isn't anything that we can't work through. You love me don't you? At least, you say that you do. Why can't we at least try? What changed in your heart that caused you to lose hope and sight of the great potential we had?

I wish that you would have expressed your doubts and concerns to me or told me what needs weren't being met. I fear that you heard from someone you thought was a trusted friend that you couldn't tell these things to me. It's never good to keep these things bottled up. I firmly believe that deep down you know that you could have talked to me about whatever you were feeling.

I don't believe that many people, who have your best interest at heart, would tell you to not talk to me about these things. Their advice would more likely have been that you should discuss these things with me. One must open up to their partner and be honest with themselves to have any chance of success and happiness with the other.

Not talking to you is the hardest thing in the world. Knowing I can't say a single thing or do anything makes me feel sick to my stomach. I get dizzy thinking about it too much.

I wake up sweaty with my heart racing a a desperate need to see you and make sure you are okay. I don't know what I've done to drive us apart. Maybe nothing. I feel completely betrayed by him and I don't know if I can ever forgive him. I can forgive you as I already have, but, not him. I don't feel anything towards him like I do you.

He told me he has been planning this for a year or so and just waited for the right time. He waited until I was out of town and he knew you had doubts. Who plans or driving others apart? What kind of person does that? Check out ""The Magician"" by Somerset Maughm and see if you can see any similarities between him and the character of Oliver Haddo.

Do you love him? Do you love him more than you love me? Or loved me? Do you have any respect for me or even care about me and my feelings?

It's hard for me to imagine that you suddenly feel that strongly for him. He is a bad person. The way that he has acted and handled this situation should make that apparent. You don't do what he has done to anyone, much less a good friend. Have I not been a good friend to him? At the end of the day one is either part of a solution or part of a problem. Which camp do you honestly think he belongs in?

God, I miss you so much. I just want to hear about what you are doing today, who you saw, what you thought. I never thought I could miss even the most trivial of details and moments. So many little things that I took for granted. Things that once felt routine suddenly seem like the greatest moments in the world.

I don't understand the complete finality of everything. I don't know why so suddenly you are so steadfast in your belief that there is no point in working at things and everything must be final. It seems so sudden and that makes everything so much harder to digest.

I can't eat or sleep and the idea that someone I thought of as my best friend (you) has so deeply betrayed me. I don't believe that you physically cheated on me, but, you did go outside our relationship to have your needs met without even expressing anything to me. You threw yourself into building a deeper relationship with a new person and shut me out before ever ending things with me. That isn't anything I did wrong, but, completely inappropriate on your part.

It hurts that you are spending this much time with him. I know what he told me and I know his intentions and his character. However, I can't tell you any of that because you don't want to hear it and you would just be pushed closer to him. Everything he is doing is just textbook manipulation. I worry and fear that every time you hang out with him it becomes more and more impossible for us to ever try to work at things.

I fear that you are hurt and confused and I understand that. I am incredibly hurt and confused. Perhaps that isn't correct and this is what you want, but, it doesn't seem or feel like you. I don't understand why you don't want to turn to any other friends. When did he become more important than me?

I think of you as smarter and better than this. I don't understand why you are doing this to us or to me. You know that spending so much time with him is killing me. Do you want things to be worse for me? Is this vindictive? Is it cathartic or pleasurable to have this kind of power to hurt someone who loves you?

I don't know how to let go of you or stop feeling the same way I have for years. You haven't wanted to work at things but you want to work at them with him? Why? Can you not find a way to explain that to me?

It kills me that I have to give you space and stay out of your life and you spend all your time with a new love interest. You don't have to call it dating, but, that's what it is. Anybody who isn't the two of you would call it dating. If you both have feelings for one another, spend all your time together, and are having sex... What would you call that?

Why won't you give us a chance? Why won't you be honest with me? Who are you becoming? Being with him, even if it is a brief rebound, will fundamentally alter the way people view you. I don't want that for you. You are better than this, I know your heart and I know your potential. I want the best for you. If I'm not it, then, I can accept that and try to move forward. But, the best for you is not a person like him and I think you know that.

He is lying to his friends about what he is doing with his time in order to spend more time with you. Why would someone lie about something if there is nothing to hide? Shouldn't love be open and everyone important to you see it and know that it's there? Love and happiness cannot be born out of this kind of betrayal, only shame and guilt.

I know you feel like he can give you emotional support but that's because he wants to right now. He will get bored with you, frustrated by tiny things you do, begin to bad mouth you to his friends (what ones he has left), grow to resent you, become emotionally abusive and then dump you. That's what he has done with every adult relationship he has had. How do you not see that? Do you not remember how he spoke of his last girlfriend (and every girlfriend) and how he treated her? It was easy to not confront or acknowledge because nobody really liked her that much. But, the fact is that she cared very deeply for him and tried to do everything she could to make him happy. He responded by, at every turn and opportunity, telling her she was weak, not fun, incapable of handling life without him, and unwanted by everyone. That is complete emotional abuse.

Remember when you got upset and tackled me at the party and I made everyone leave? You were upset over something he said, not me. You know me and my heart and know that I've never talked or thought that way. Hell, he told us that he got back with his last girlfriend to ""help prepare her to be able to live life without me."" What kind of person looks at the world and others like that? What kind of ego must posses someone to even get in that mindset?

He has never in his life been selfless. Remember how he treated me on my own birthday last year? On Tuesday after you dumped me he offered to take me out for a beer. We sat and talked for awhile and drank 4 beers each. When we asked for the check he requested 1 bill. When it came he said thanks for the beers, but, he had to go...he let me pick up the tab. What is that? His cheery disposition and happy attitude should have been another clue. He was relishing in my heartache.

I am finding comfort in the fact that I am a fundamentally a better person than him. People know what he has done and will lose a great deal of respect for him. He yelled at me, I've never raised my voice at him. At first he got upset with me for even confronting him, then he admitted his intentions and what was going on and proceeded to get upset with me for telling people what he was doing. He said it wasn't my place to interfere with his private life... Really? I would certainly agree that it isn't right to interfere with others private lives. I absolutely agree with that.

Can you be with someone that your loved ones don't respect? People will be cordial to you at parties, but, they will absolutely think less of you and will have no respect for him.

I can't give up hope on us. I feel that deep down you want to give this a try. Perhaps I am wrong, but, it is so difficult to displace the notion of spending the rest of my life with you. I know that we have the tools and ability to build a wonderful, beautiful, and loving relationship that will enhance both of our lives for as long as we both shall live.

I don't understand how you can't see what he is doing is so shitty. You're so smart, how do you not see that? Look completely outside your feelings for or towards me... How do you not see any of that? How do you not see his lack of character?

I want to write you a text or another email to just remind you how much I love you and how much you mean to me. I'm afraid that in doing so I will just push you further away from me. Do you know how painful that is? To be afraid to tell someone you love them? It's wildly painful, I can't describe it.

I'm not ready to give up on the idea that we can still work at things. It will be a long tough road but I know that it would be worth it because, as I'm sure you do, I know the potential we have together. You would have to rid him of your life completely, we would have to take things slow, and we would get couple's counseling immediately. 

I don't know who you are right now. None of your behavior seems like you. It's hard to reconcile the way you are behaving now with the person I know and have loved for years. There are a lot of people that just think you're acting strange. You're so smart and driven, is sitting around watching baseball what you really want out of life? How do you not see that his behavior shows him to be untrustworthy on an extremely deep level? How do you not recognize his lack of ethics, morals, or character?

It hurts me to think you are hurting. Right now I feel like you are really hurting deep down regardless of how things are between us. I fear you hurt in a much deeper existential sense. I'm not as concerned about being with you as much as I am for you. I'm worried that you are hurting so badly that you are questioning everything. It isn't healthy to question EVERYTHING at once. You can't do that to yourself.

I wish I could reach out to you and tell you how much I love you, but, also remind you of how smart, strong, and wise you are... I hurt thinking you don't know those things right now. You need to know them and never forget them.

If you are hurting, scared, and nervous about the future you should know that I feel the same way. If you feel that way I wish you could talk to me about it. Even if we don't talk about us right now I wish you would just talk to me about what you are feeling about your life.

Everything has happened so suddenly. Amazing the things one can experience in a short amount of time. I've felt every emotion under the sun in the last month.

I love you L. I love you so much. I hope that you give me a chance and try to open your heart and let love back in. I firmly believe that if you open up to me and let my love for you back into your life we can use this as an opportunity to build and grow and ultimately come out stronger and better for having gone through something difficult. It's like the Avett Brothers say, ""True love is not the kind of thing you should turn down. Don't ever turn it down."" Honestly, ""January Wedding"" ""Shame"" and ""Weight of Lies"" feel so perfect for the things I feel.

You have to be open to it though. You have to want to work at things. I want to and will always hope that we can.

It doesn't hurt me that you slept with him as much as it does that you love him and not me. If it was just sex with some guy it wouldn't hurt in the same way. It would bother me, but, I would somewhat understand. You're a beautiful, sensual, and sexy woman and there are tons of men that would jump at the opportunity to sleep with you. The fact that it was someone you have deeper feelings for and someone who I considered such a close friend hurts. It feels like you've replaced me. You say that you haven't, but, your actions show that you have. You haven't even attempted to just be alone.

It's very hard for me to think that you are really considering everything. After all the time we have had together and the life we were planning why don't you want to express any of your concerns with me? Why don't you want to even take the opportunity to talk to me and express how you feel? 

You tell me you want me around as a friend. You can't have your cake and eat it, too. I've tried to be so kind to you through all of this. I've tried to be respectful of you. You say you still love me, but, how can you treat me this way?

I cared about making sure you were okay before thinking about how I felt. That is how much you mean to me. You are more important to me than I am. How fucked up is that?

Pretty fucked up I'd say.

People who care about me keep saying that I need to cut all ties with you completely. They keep telling me that I can't be involved with you, that you can't be trusted and you are just going to hurt me like this again. They tell me I am better off without you. A better person to be rid of you and not have you in my life.

I don't feel that way.

Not yet.

Maybe not ever.

I guess I need to get there. To get to a point where I resent you, where I hate you. I can't imagine feeling those things for you. Maybe that makes me weak. Maybe my desire to have you in my life is somehow seen by you as weakness. I guess it's pathetic to some degree.

You say you are blown away by my maturity in how I have handled all of this. How immature do you think I am? How weak minded was your picture of me? Have you not seen every challenge I've faced? The person I've made myself to be? The things I have overcome and worked through? Look where my life was when we first started dating and look where it is now.

You say that I wasn't focused on the here and now, that I was too ""goal oriented."" Were you not goal oriented too? What have you been doing your whole life other than setting goals and striving to meet them? What was graduate school? How is being goal oriented a bad thing? Isn't that something valuable? Maybe I should have been more focused on the here and now, but, I shouldn't be made to feel bad for wanting things from my life with you and working to get them.

Christ, even in a fucking email I won't send I berate you with questions. It feels like you are here, sitting across from me and I am finally again able to communicate all the things I think and feel. You aren't here though. I can't see you, I can't speak to you. I hate that. I want to tell you so many things. I feel like when we do speak we make great strides and progress. We need to communicate.

But... It's too much. There is too much in my heart to communicate to you in any single conversation. There is too much I feel for you to fit into a nice little package with a bow. Life, unfortunately, doesn't work that way.

To some degree we are all just floating around without purpose or direction. But, occasionally you bump into someone else who you latch onto and between the two of you there is enough force of energy and spirit, to drive you towards a common goal, a common interest, a common desire.

We were fortunate enough to bump into each other and latch on and move life forward together.

Life is a scary and messy son of a bitch, but, you don't have to let it be. You push through bad times, you open up and communicate, you let love into your heart. Right? Am I crazy for thinking these things to be true?

I feel like I should express anger and pain and betrayal and frustration. I can't though. When I feel like I am talking to you or am speaking about you I can't say anything bad about you. I simply feel this urge to confess my undying love for you. 

There is a desperate desire to write something beautiful enough to make you feel what I feel for you. Or, at the very least, better understand my feelings for you.

I wish I had a better command of our language so that I could more succinctly express everything I feel. I know he will say what you want to hear and find ways to make you feel what you want to feel.

You aren't being honest with yourself and that is, in my opinion, dangerous.

Part of me wants to be back with you, but, I fear that everyone I know and cares about me will lose respect for me. How can I respect myself and take you back? To do that I should have taken your advice and told no one that you were with him, right?

I love you so much, it scares me constantly. I sometimes looked upon you and just thought to myself, ""Jesus, you are so lucky. Look at how the world has blessed you. You have a beautiful woman in your life who loves you, who wants to have children with you, that wants to build a life with you. How can one man be blessed with so much?""

I have grown to know that I am better than my circumstances, better than my surroundings, and better than what happens to me. I have the wisdom and strength to know that there are better things in the future for me despite what may be given to me in the present. One lives their life by an internal, incommunicable, set of codes and principles. I have those...he does not. How could he?

L, you may not see it, but, I truly do try to be good to those that care about me. I don't know how you couldn't see that. I'm sorry that you heard me speak ill of people at times, but, sometimes I needed to let that out. It's difficult always being the nonjudgmental friend who constantly shows he cares.

I just want to feel like someone cares about me for who I am.

It amazes me that so many people tell me I am a good guy and deserve better, yet, the only person who's opinion matters to me is yours.

When you say your sorry are sorry for what you did or just sorry I found out? Are you sorry you hurt me or are you sorry that you've learned you have the capacity to be this hurtful?

It doesn't bother me that you slept with him necessarily... (You can do better though!) It bothers me that you are replacing me. Look at yourself, your fucking gorgeous and so beautiful. Pretty much every guy I know wants to sleep with you. I hurt that someone else gets to share life with you, not a bed. It hurts that you are willing to talk to him about what you think and feel and not me.

It's very painful to know that you have the capacity to hurt me deeply and be completely unaffected by that. That may not be entirely true, but, from my perspective it seems to be.

So many little things that I took for granted. Things that once felt routine suddenly seem like the greatest moments in the world and at the same time distant memories. I wish I could hear you laugh at one of my stupid jokes or have you practice another lesson on me. I miss laying on the couch with pup and listening to you play piano. You play so beautifully and I took so much joy in your ability to make such amazing music.

I miss the way you would pinch and slowly roll the skin on my knuckles while we held hands. I miss eating Ice-Pops with you in that old sweltering apartment. I miss dinosaur chicken nuggets and green bean dinners. I miss laughing at each other and at our pup. I miss baked bean kisses and golden monkey book ends. I miss listening to music and discussing its meaning. I miss singing the whole soundtrack to The Muppets with you!

I'm going to miss nights were we just flopped the two of us and watched a movie. I'm going to miss having a few drinks with you and belting out some of our favorite songs... I'll miss the way you let me sing even though I am terrible at it.

Most of all I miss sharing life with you, I miss being there for you when you're hurting, having you there for me when I hurt. I miss the happiness I got from being with you and enjoying each day, I miss seeing the world through your eyes.

At first I felt as though my whole world and life had been ripped away from me in addition to having my heart torn out. That wasn't a healthy way to work through this. I'm now trying to put this in a positive light. I've grown and matured with you and now I must use this as an opportunity to grow and mature independently. I have a great job and the bright future of a career in field that I enjoy. I want my life defined by how I treat others, always trying to do the right thing, the content of my character, and a desire to have people I've known better off for having known me.

I hope that you reflect back on our relationship and time together as positively as I am able to. We had incredible amounts of fun, took amazing trips, and learned to coexist with someone we loved.

Ultimately, L, I want to say thank you. I truly can't express my gratitude to you enough.

Thank you for making me feel special. Thank you for showing me there is true love in this world, even if it wasn't meant for us. Thank you for seeing me through dark times. Thank you for helping me to see my own potential. Thank you for helping to raise our dog together, he is my best friend. Thank you for loving not just me, but, my family despite knowing all their faults and flaws. Thank you for making the time we had together as wonderful and special as it was. But most of all, dear L, thank you for being my friend.

I hurt, yes, but on the whole you have been nothing but good to me and I refuse to allow the end of one thing to cloud how I see you, how I feel about you, or how I remember you and our years together.

The time we had was special and nothing either of us can do or say can change that. We were both very happy together for the vast majority of our relationship. That's special and I will always value and treasure that.

Goodbye L. I wish you the best of luck and a long healthy happy, and prosperous life. Be good to yourself, true to your heart, and kind to others. Be as much of a positive impact on those whose lives you touch as possible. 

Take care of and show gratitude to those who love and value you, for that is special. Know the faults and flaws of those you care about, but, focus on bringing out the best that you see in them.

Surround yourself with good people and good friends. Put love and kindness out there (as you always do) and it will come back to you a million times over.

We were your little girls first, you know. I've always been jealous of my stepsister because she gets to be with you all the time. I saw you once in the past four years. I'll admit that I get jealous when I go through her pictures on her facebook and the caption reads, ""My dad and I."" I don't wanna share you with her... Then again, I guess that's just silly of me.

Daddy, I've always made excuses for you. Did you know that? When you say you're going to do something for me and the plans don't work out, I make up reasons for why they didn't. Mamma tells me that it's okay to be mad at you but, I just can't. You're my dad. I love you way too much to be mad at you for not visiting me. It's just wasted energy. I keep telling myself that you'll change and actually put forth the effort to be in my life but... When?

I graduate this Saturday, Daddy. I did it! Your little girl is going to be walking across the stage to accept her high school diploma. You won't see it, though. I invited you. I even begged you.

I don't really need one, though.

You said you try to be there. You promised me that you're going to try your hardest to watch me walk. I believe you.

You were trash from the start and I think in a way you knew that. You were looking for any way out  of you marriage and thought you could clean up and be a suburb housewife. My father wasn't a perfect man but you sunk your claws into him deep and he never really realized what a huge mistake you were till the end.  You destroyed my childhood, and now you have destroyed my life. When I was 8 I walked right up to you and said ""You bitch."" You thought I was joking because I was quite the foul mouthed kid. I meant it. I hated you and your trash offspring from day one. 
You laid every guilt trip in the book on my dad knowing he was the kind of person who wanted to help everyone. He improved your quality of life 10 fold and this is how you repay him. You sucked the life out of him for 10 years. 
I should not have put up with you as long as I did and I should have been more honest with my father. Maybe then he would have seen you for what you really are and gotten rid of you when he had the chance. 
Your shitty ungrateful kids stole from him, leeched off of him, and disrespected him for years. only a worthless leech like you could turn the man with infinite patience into a nervous wreck. 
I will never forgive you for doing that to him. 
I will never forgive you for taking the greatest man I have ever met and drain him into nothing until he couldn't take it anymore. 
I want you to know that now that he is gone I am NOT putting up with your crazy bullshit anymore. you are NOT family. just because you changed your name does not make you family.  The M family HATES YOU. they all hate you and have never liked you. even after the funeral they still talked about how much they can't fucking stand you.
you will never be an M. you will always be a kofl. 
My father deserved better. It should not have ended like this.
You should understand I am NOT my father. I will not yeld to you like he did. I will NOT put up with your power struggle. 
I will get the family heirlooms and what rightfully belongs to me. even if i have to burn the house to the ground i would rather see it as a pile of ash than in your possession. 
Stay the fuck away from my brother. You will not leech sympathy off him.  
I want you to remember. I want you to think about it every day. 
YOU. KILLED. MY FATHER.
YOU are the reason he is dead.
YOU drained the life out of him.
I want that to haunt you.
I want you to think about that and feel the guilt. Until you can't take it anymore.

The only way my father's death will be avenged is when you take your last breath.
Kill yourself.
 

I hope you fucking off yourself.
only then will this wrong be made right.

10 years of anger brewing inside of me. I get the last laugh. I know you couldn't stand that I was his sun and moon and you came second. 

but even now after he is gone you still have to be a jealous bitch to me? it's over. 
no matter how hard you cried or how much you threatened or how much you put him though... I will always be his #1. and you know that.

It's funny because after all the searching over the years, you just happened to stumble into my life as soon as I had given up. And getting to know you so well, I know you were just as 'broken' as I was when we met. We saved each other and what we had was special. At least that's what I thought.

You only had to wait for me for six months. You know I didn't want to leave you, and you know I had no choice. Either one of us can be called to deployed at a moments notice. I was scared out of my mind. Not because of the deployment, but because I was about to be without you for half a year when I already grew use to waking up next to you in the morning. I grew used to having someone there to talk to. I grew used to my arm always falling asleep because you were always laying on top of it. I grew used to taking showers with you and your perfume and all the amazingly small things that you did to try and make my day the best. I was about to be without the life that I had grown accustomed to with you and the truth is I meant it when I told you that I loved you. When the taxi showed up to take me to the airport it was the first time I remember EVER seeing you cry and it tore me to pieces. You didn't say it then, but I knew you loved me too.

I guess this wouldn't have hurt so much had you not told me later that you loved me too. I immediately started to count down the days till I could see you again. I had given up hours upon hours of sleep just so that I could talk to you or see your face on skype. And it was stressful. God damn, it was stressful, but we both had to make it work. I thought we were going to. I thought we agreed to stop arguing and try to make the best of it. I thought wrong.

How do you think I felt waking up to find out that you had began a relationship with another man? It's one thing to cheat on your significant other, and it's another to cheat on one that is deployed, but to not even tell him? To find out through a social fucking network? Your reasoning is that you needed someone to be there for you physically? That's an amazing excuse, **withheld**. Pause for a moment and try to imagine the roles being reversed. How would you feel had I not even told you that we were over and I immediately started to see someone else? Then imagine me telling you ""I only did it because I needed you to be here for me and you weren't so I found someone else who was."" 

You have no idea what you did to me. Being out here was stressful enough, but it wasn't just this place. You knew my parents were going through a divorce. You knew of my sister's financial situation. You knew I had no choice! I was sick of feeling helpless, I was killing myself trying to fix these things I had no control over, and I just needed you to support me. I felt like I was letting everyone down. And you want to know the fucked up part about you and I? I felt like I let *you* down. For the last two months all I've thought about is you. I keep thinking about what I could have done different that might have changed the outcome of us. I keep thinking ""What did I do to cause this to happen?"". I keep thinking that I was never good enough for you. And you know what I realized the other day with the help of my section chief? It's not me.

I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that I gave you a hundred percent of what I am. I am by no stretch of the imagination perfect, but I never put as much effort into anything as I did to our relationship. You are the second 'love of my life' as they say, and I did truly love you the best that I could. However, it was you that made the choice to kill us. It was you who couldn't wait a lousy six months to see me. It was you.

It's been about two months since it's happened. I haven't said a single word to you since finding out that you were seeing another man. I come home in a month, **withheld**. I've wanted to send you this letter for a very long time, but I can't bring myself to do it. I can't let you see that you've won or that I'm back to that broken state you found me in before. I want to be mad at you so much, and a part of me holds all that rage inside for you, but it does no good. I can't force you to love me and I would never do so even if I could. I know I'm going to see you when I get back, and I have no idea what I'm going to say, and quite frankly I'm terrified of even thinking of it. Seeing you two together, if you still are at that point, will only crush me and cement me into a dark place that all this time has been creating for me. This time I have little doubt I'll be able to find my way back out.

You told me one of the first days after we started to talk that the one thing that bothers you most is when people call you heartless. I was one of the very few who had never ever told you that you were. And you know what? I still don't believe you are. As much as I'd like to say that you are to piss you off, you aren't. It may have been for nothing now, but you saved me from myself and you never had to. You showed me how to love again and you brought life back into me. I'm grateful to you for that, but now... I just wish you'd forget I ever existed and I you. And I wish I had the heart to send this to you.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_t3phx,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/t3phx/to_the_one_who_couldnt_wait/,

You were the first girl I ever truly loved who loved me back.  When I was around you, I was able to be myself, and for a while that was enough.  Then something changed.  I couldn't put my finger on it at first; I guess hindsight is 20/20.

I remember when you first told me about him.  His name was John, he was in your theater group.  He's handsome, he's polite, he's going to India next year as a missionary for fuck's sake.  As you described him, he sounded perfect.  I feel so blind, looking back.  I should have heard it in the long pause that followed your diatribe about what a fucking hero this guy was.  The worst part is that you didn't even realize you were doing it.  You were falling in love with this guy right in front of me, but both of us were too stupid to see it.  Your far-off look gave you away, but even when alarm bells should have rang, I trusted you.

The thing I hate most is that there's no one to blame.  I know you can't help your feelings, you just fell out of love.  The problem is that *I didn't*.  So now, just a few weeks later, I still go back to your blog like a moth to a flame.  I see you writing poetry about him; you're much less cryptic than you think.  I see you going with your heart, but I hope he fucking crushes it.

You faked it so well.  Every moment up until you broke down and told me how you ""felt distant"", I had no idea.  I forget how good of an actress you are.

There were so many warning signs.  The way you'd treat your parents, your unreasonably posh group of friends, the way you handled your last relationship; You proved time and time again what a fucking child you could be.  You manipulated people right in front of me, but there was still that voice in the back of my head that said, ""She'll never do that to me"".

When you'd slip up and let your bullshit insecurities seep through, I was there.  But you pulled back the moment I stopped being your lightning rod for stupid teenage stress.

People keep telling me that I should write you a letter and never send it, so I guess this is it.  Goodbye, Anna.  I'm sure I'll wish you the best some day, or just manage to save yourself from yourself.  It's more than I was able to do.

You made me feel special, wanted and loved for 3 months of my life. I felt like I never had before. I'm sorry you weren't my first and I think I'll always regret that. I loved when you would stay up late just for me even when you really wanted to go to sleep. I loved how you would watch scary movies with me even when it was the last thing that you wanted to do in the world.

I loved how I could close my eyes knowing you were still looking at me and I would be the only thing on your mind.

But then I realized I wasn't. Someone else was always more important, even though I always turned my phone off for you. You would honestly rather sit in your room by yourself then see me for a few hours. You would tell me everything you didn't like about me, knowing I was still trying to change. You were too afraid to tell your parents I go to therapy twice a week because you didn't want them to know anything about me. You told me you just wanted me to be normal. You made me afraid to leave you alone in my room because I didn't want you to touch my diary, just to say sorry, and do it again.

You would tell me not to hurt myself after breaking up with me.. every time. That did nothing, and you stopped nothing.

&gt;Hi, M.
&gt;
&gt;Another semi-regular missive pointed in your direction. I'm not sure if you read these, or if you even receive them. Usually I assume you do. Maybe this time I'll assume you're not going to read it. It might help me say what I need to say.
&gt;
&gt;You know those moments in your life when you stay up late and go on Omegle and end up chatting with a teenage Brazilian girl who's got a firm grasp of the English language, a common interest in Pride &amp; Prejudice, and a *much* older soul than you and you end up talking to her about love for like 2 hours and how you've basically shut yourself off from it so she encourages you to open yourself back up and live passionately and open-heartedly no matter how much it hurts, and you recognize that this is exactly the pep talk you needed and thank god for 15-year-old Brasilians?
&gt;
&gt;Well I had one of those moments last night.
&gt;
&gt;Then today because Lorena The Brasilian challenged me to not be such a bump on a log, I drove out to Cornwall for a ""Poetry Un-Slam"" at the library. The poems were great but, Christ on a Cross, I could barely make it through them. I was sitting there in the library surrounded by artsy septuagenarians all the while having an emotional breakdown. After the last poem I went and collapsed in the bathroom and bawled. This wasn't because the poems were that sad…
&gt;
&gt;It was because I just don't go out to that part of the state any more. Because I don't want to see all these places you and me once were together.
&gt;
&gt;Because I don't want to face the fact that I'm still in love with you.
&gt;
&gt;But I think about you every day. Every single damn day. You come up and I just have to push you back down. It hurts too much to miss you. But as Lorena would advise me, the pain is worth it if I get to regain my heart.
&gt;
&gt;You know I've tried to move on, to distract myself, but every time I start getting anything like close with some woman, it feels disingenuous. And disloyal to my feelings. I just don't want to lead women on--I can't be that guy.
&gt;
&gt;I'm also convinced no one could make me feel the way you did. Meeting you was like gaining a new sense perception or seeing an entirely new color. You rocked me.
&gt;
&gt;My past letters were attempts to reach out in a friendly manner. Yes, I'm curious how you are doing--and your family and friends; I miss them too. They are some of the best people I've ever met.
&gt;
&gt;I think I was trying to be friendly because I was trying to forge a different relationship with you--one that would supersede my feelings. I think that was naive.
&gt;
&gt;So if you read this, you know now that I still love you.
&gt;
&gt;Lorena would be proud. Hell, I'm proud. You know I have self-esteem now? For a while I thought I missed you just because of how you made me feel, how our relationship helped my self-esteem. Well I'm living on my own and working full time now. My self-esteem is pretty healthy. I don't feel I *need* a relationship. I was in such crappy headspace when I met you. I sometimes wish I could un-meet you so that I can meet you again only while I'm in the better headspace I'm in.
&gt;
&gt;But even in my better place, my place of less neediness, I still miss you. Turns out I just like you a whole lot. All of you. The whole package.
&gt;
&gt;And God, if I haven't done it, can I apologize for being a condescending prick in my communication with you at the end? I'm pretty embarrassed about that. I was a prick; what can I say? I was reeling. I was blind to anything going wrong up until like the last week. I could tell  you were agitated. . . I just didn't know why. I still don't, even if I have a zillion guesses.
&gt;
&gt;So I don't know where you're at. I don't know if you live in Vermont or CT or if you died in some freak tea-brewing accident or what. A year and a half is a long time. I don't know if you have a boyfriend or a husband or a wife or all three. Or if you flat out just want me to go away and stop trying to contact you.
&gt;
&gt;If you're unavailable for some kind of reconnection with me I would consider it a really really huge huge favor if you wrote back and told me so. It would help me move on, and I'd stop writing you.
&gt;
&gt;But in the slim chance that you miss me, too, or have been dealing with similar feelings... please let me know. We could take it gently. No expectations. I don't know what I want. I just know I still love you and I'd like to try again, whatever that means.
&gt;
&gt;Because maybe, just maybe, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet.

How I love you.  I'll never forget the moment I fell in love with you over 4 long years ago.  


I can't believe how much we learned from each other.  Both of us, dumb kids from different sides of the world, came together and began to question everything about what we had known.  We were both shocked to find out how unoriginal we both were, that we were both so uniquely defined by the cultural norms that had been shoved down our throats.  We both began to question what we thought was right and wrong, things that had seemed so obvious no longer were.  This changed both of our lives, and we're both better people for it.  but in the end, we are not so different than how we started out.  I guess that's life.  But that is what has ended us.


Of course your family wants a nice Indian girl.  I tried for a long time.  I really did.  I learned to cook Indian food, I learned to think like an Indian, I adopted Indian family values as my own, everything about me changed ,and I didn't mean it to, and you never asked me to.  Now that you are gone, I'm left with India as my second home.  I understand it more than I understand my own country at times.  


I know you want to work it out, but they will never accept me my love, and deep down, you know it.  Come on, we've both lived enough to know those happy endings only occur in cheesy Hindi films.  They will hate me.  Your younger sister won't be able to get married.  Your brother in law will take it out on your sister.  When your fathers health declines more, they will all blame it on you.  If they decide to keep you in their life, they will treat me like a slave, like shit, until I am broken down, so that I will have to live with the fact of breaking up your family like the home wrecking westerner they see me as.  You love them, and you love me, and these things will only cause devastation for you, and that's why I must let you go.  I appreciate that you are willing to fight them to be with me.  But there is so much more to overcome.  It's just not worth it anymore.


So one day, in a few years, when you are a big shot engineer and they have set you up with a girl, I wonder if you will ever tell her about me.  It will all be so predictable.  She'll be a doctor, or an engineer, fair skinned, shy and simple, from a good respectable family.  Your parents will be happy to get a new car for dowry.  There will be a big celebration and the relatives who would hate you now for being with me will all show up and shower you with gifts and sit in the cheesy plastic chairs and eat the free buffet at your marriage. All the petty bullshit drama will occur of what tradition to follow, and what custom dictates who pays for what.  Backbiting will be glossed over with feigned camaraderie  so no one looks bad.   But forget all that,  because she'll be a nice girl, I'm sure.  And this is the only thing that makes me happy.   I hope so badly that she makes you happy, I hope that she does not get mad at your little quirks, your clumsiness, the way you sing to yourself in public and don't even realize it, the way you put your shirt on inside out and could go all day without realizing it.  I love you for those things.   I hope you feel open enough to tell her about your hopes and dreams, that you do fun things together so you don't get restless.  I hope you go on trips to no where and sit on the hood of the car and stare at the stars with her.  I hope you have a long and happy life with her.  I hope she gives you beautiful children that you love and adore.  And I hope one day, maybe 10 or 15 years down the road, maybe after attending your younger sister's marriage, snuggled up next to your wife, you will lay awake late at night and thank me for forcing you to let go of me.  I hope at that time you will be able to look at me fondly, and remember all of the wonderful times, and that maybe a smile will come on your face.  I can only hope.

See, I used to have this joke. I would do something stupid or nerdy then say, ""And that's why women won't date me."" Seriously, before we got together I was 19 and never had a real relationship. Being the rationalist I am, I honestly believed that I didn't have the ability to be romantic. You know how guys seem to naturally how to be sweet and affectionate to their girls? Yeah, I was convinced that for some reason, that wasn't in me.

I was so very wrong. 

Sure it took a little while for me to let it out, and at first it wasn't very refined and needed development, but I discovered a part of myself that I literally did not believe existed. I've never really flirted with anyone... but when I was with you, oh wow did I ever! XD

I LOVE cuddling. It's just amazing. Seriously. Don't bother trying to seduce me (and fortunately you weren't the type to do that), just cuddle with me. I remember having the stupidest, most euphoric grin on my face as I had you in my arms.

And kisses on the cheek. I prefer those infinitely more than kisses on the lip. Somehow they are just more enjoyable.

I guess you'd say I'm more of a platonic person. Don't care much for intense physical intimacy. I'm not necessary repressed or impotent, just easily amused. :)

I have a lot more confidence in my ability to find a partner. The romantic side of me does exist, and does it ever! Someday someone will catch my fancy, and I will catch hers. And we will be a weird couple. A happily weird couple! :D

Hello! Me here. Your ""female"" friend-and I use female in quotation marks because, in case you hadn't picked up on it yet, I'm transgender! But that's a whole other can of worms.

I just thought you should know that whenever I joke about wanting to have sex with you, which I do at least 3 times a day by my count, it's because I actually, legitimately want to have sex with you. Yes, I know I'm only 16 and you're 17, and I've never even had my first kiss yet and god knows if you've been up to something. This is why I've never actually asked you out on a date.

Being horny as fuck is a new experience for me, and I'm still figuring out how not to rape you. Making jokes about fucking you slow and dirty is how I blow off steam when I suddenly realize I want to fuck you slow and dirty. I'm not sure if this will pass, since, again, being horny as fuck is not something that usually happens to me, but if it doesn't-and you're okay with the whole transgender thing-and you don't ""value our friendship"" or some bullshit-I might just ask you out.

I'm about 80% sure I'm in love with you. I smile when you're around and don't even realize it until you leave and I stop smiling. I text you at 10 PM, and I don't think you realize that I have never texted anyone at 10 PM before. Somehow I told you that I had clinical depression and you told me that you had it, too, and then we shared stories and it was the most amazing thing that's ever happened to me. My other friends don't know, even the ones who've known me longer, and they wouldn't understand. You understand.

You make my world brighter when I'm in a dark place and oh my god put your penis in my vagina you wanker I'm so horny.

I tried to find my girlfriend to tell her ""hey I am shitting my brains out don't worry about where I am"" but I couldn't find her. After a clenched walk around the store I finally found her. I was now in a increasingly desperate dash to the bathroom which I found empty.


I immediately got a bad vibe from the toilet when I walked into the stall. The water was low and ominous and some toilet paper was floating around the bottom. Maybe I should have left right then but it was too late shit was going to blow. I plop down on the toilet and had wicked burning liquid shit. You know the kind. After throughly cleaning up I got ready to flush the toilet. But remembering the bad vibes I was nervous about the flush. I hit the lever and jump back.


What happens next could only be described as a three foot tall geyser of shit. Brown defiled water kept shooting up into the air and raining down on the floor. When that finally stopped the water level went up over the edge of the bowl spilling more diarrhea onto the floor. Paniced by the malfunctioning toilet I hurried out of the stall and washed my hands. As I was washing you walked into the bathroom and went into the stall. For a moment we made eye contact. The fear and disgust in your eyes was easy to see.

Everyone always told me that I would get the feeling once I met the right person.

When I met you, and I got those feelings.. I didn't know you for long though so it kind of freaked me out. I didn't know how to deal with them, they were confusing. I thought ""How could I feel this way about someone I have just met. How can I have these feelings for someone I'm not even dating..""

How can you tell someone that you've only just met that they give you these feelings?

We went out a few times, it was awesome. We spent the whole after noon laughing and having a great time. I have to say, it was the best day I've ever had. If I could go back and do it again I would. The kisses we shared, the times we held hands, it was perfect to me.

Now you're gone. I may never see or hear from you again. I'm not really sure what your reasons were, maybe you weren't really into me, maybe you still haven't gotten over your past. It hurt when you had to let me down. I so badly wanted to tell you how I felt and how you made me feel. Instead I decided to let you go.

Even though I have these feelings, I want you to be happy. I'm not really sure how I'm supposed to feel, some say I should be pissed, but I'm not. I'm sad that I had to let you go, but I'm happy that I can feel this way about someone. I don't want you to be the one that got away, but it seems like that is whats going to happen.

Someday, maybe, we will meet again. I hope so. I'll never forget you and the time we spent together, and I hope you never forget me.

I know that you didn't mean to hurt me like this, and I understand. I just wish there was something more I could say, or do. I never stop thinking about you. Everyday I check my mail, phone and e-mail with the slightest hope that I will see a message, with your name attached. I'm not sure when I will stop checking.

How long is it supposed to take for someone to get over these feelings? Especially since this is the first time I have ever felt this way. I'm almost in my 30's, this is the first time for me.

If I could ask you one more question. It would be; Will you always remember me? Will you never forget me? I really wish I would have asked.
 
I wish you the best in your future, and I hope everything turns out well for you. I will always be here for you. I will never forget you, you will always be welcome here. You know how patient I am, if you come back asking for forgiveness, you know I will give you it. I will wait.

I told you the brownie was potent and that it would last for hours. I gave you the option to not take it. You and your friend took it. She flipped her shit and you had to call he mom.

Maybe you think I was blissfully unaware of your other life, but I challenge you to think again. I was fully aware that your job did not keep you as busy as you said it did. You were far too stressed out of a person not to be juggling more than you let on. 
I had several other red flags about you throughout our time together and I really just want you to know that you need to stay away from other women. Next time you get the urge to cheat on your women go to counseling instead, or maybe try a separation. It isnt helping you and much like a junky thinking nobody can tell they do drugs, you are not fooling anyone. You need help. 
Now that I have pointed fingers at you I will tell you thank you for teaching this old dog a few new things about people. You truly have a great happy spirit, but you need to stop feeding off of others. 
Good Luck

It's funny. I feel like I've slipped into an old habit that died off years ago, for the better. You will never see this, I hope to fucking hell. 

I will never shout from the rooftops about anything less than a political revolution. I feel no need to even raise my voice. I'm not random, warm, outwardly loving. These traits you value don't keep the world turning, or make it worth living in, or bring the greatest happiness in life. Just as much, the person who quietly moves forward with their life holds the world together. The greatest joys in life are just as much about keeping your mouth closed and your head down, doing what needs to be done, and appreciating the complete silence of an empty room. An even simpler joy is having read enough books that you always have something to think about and can rest easy because no one can take that away. You will never suffer from boredom for the rest of your life. 

You're crazy random. I'm serious composed, or I am something like it, as I attempt to balance my emotions with long-term rational thought. It's almost embarrassing how pretentious it sounds to point out, but I guess I have to. I'm at odds with you, and culture. I was ""cold"", while you dance. It's exactly like one of those shitty movies. These people are fucked up, in these movies. But through repeated efforts at having fun, a little patience on the part of girl-with-bangs, possibly drug use, they overcome their problems and life is transformed. Or some shit. But our problems, unlike in movies, are central to who we are because they're not just problems, but ways of dealing. 

Those movies about the crazy girl and the geekish possibly depressed guy are the script for your life, so it's worth noting that those movies are more worthless crap manufactured to feed a stupid culture that has no idea what love is. I can't claim to be any kind of expert on love but I sure as hell know bullshit from going to public school and reading the internet. Zero depressed people on this planet need a girl to simply skip into their life and try to turn it upside down. I was talking to actual, real, licensed shrinks about my problems for a few years since I was relatively young, most of which helped none at all because as best anyone can tell I never went through a legitimate single traumatic experience with a definite end or beginning except for the entire prison system of public school, and I also had the pleasure of taking medication which was worse. In short, there's no quick treatment for public school, or to put it another way considering the time spent there, ""life"". Like me, and other people, you vastly underestimate the differences between yourself and people around you. If being a warm and sunshiney person helps you, then it helps you. If being a direct and rude person works for me, then it works for me. These are just our strategies for dealing with life. They don't work in all situations. They don't make us all as happy, or free feeling. 

It's ridiculous for me to even try to guess what love is, so I won't try. But I do know you would have no interest if you didn't get to play the rescuer or life-brightening role, and that's about you. In reality, you and any other person you think is fucked up would probably end up the same. New years eve, sometime around high school graduation, I was essentially the same person I was years before when we met, and I would stay essentially the same person. I'm not the same person today, but that has almost nothing to do with you. You cried for the most standard of reasons, nobody understands me, I'm not all sunshine and roses, tears streaming, deeply personal, etc. It's hard to believe but that is easily the best moment of any new years party, or any party, I've been to. But I should've read the script to your favorite movie and I would've seen it coming. 

You could literally talk to someone for a few hours and discover something like their greatest character flaw. Not every time. It gets a lot easier with people you know for years, except when you are blinded by them being family or someone you like. Especially if they're physically attractive, or even worse, both physically attractive and they have intuitively re-invented the scientology love-bomb and use it against you in tenth grade. The point is, it's really easy to see that I like books more than people, being alone more than company, and have a beyond-reasonable desire for control over my own life. It's easy to see because I don't play well with others. Or I do, but I resent the fact that I have to put up with it. You, on the other hand, and people like you, have a nicer strategy, that presents itself as benevolent and caring, but underneath it probably has about the same feeling. Maybe. Maybe you wonder why all these stupid fucking people can't see that most of your smiles are fake, like new years, or maybe you don't think like that. In any case, I doubt being an asshole has really made me suffer more. 

America is full of really unhappy people who can't figure their shit out. We're Americans. Everyone's going to hell and they're not working hard enough. All your problems are totally of your own making, just choose to be normal already. We inherited this culture of religious bullshit and consumerism bullshit and there is nothing that hasn't been sold to us as the answer. Being convinced that we're really fucked up and not good enough is the basis of American spirituality and economy. It's just a little too easy for me to think either of us is really that messed up. Those thoughts and feelings are the air we breathe and water we drink. The whole culture. Then again. 

I feel tired and like I've exhausted most everything that I wanted to say. All this appeared from the modern horror of Facebook, pleasantly reminding me that friends of friends are sometimes people you used to already be friends with. Which is exactly what I expect from Facebook, don't get me wrong, that's all you get when you go swimming in a giant pool made of other people's narcissism. By the way, welcome to my corner of the pool. Usually it's neat and clean but currently a bit of a swamp. If I was cut out to be a real writer I would get drunk and go through your pictures, wondering why you're so pretty in this one and so ugly in the next, lots of melancholy, wade through the feelings, etcetera, but I'm not. Whether or not you love somebody is a personal thing probably best kept to yourself if the feeling makes no sense. This is exactly the sort of thing that makes me seem like the crazy person but it's really just thinking long term. It really is possible, really, really, possible, to be driven by an impulse that, as best you can tell, is trying to annihilate your whole life. Love can absolutely be stupid and destructive. Some guy once wrote this story about this broad named Helen of Troy where she and this other moron fall in love and tons of people die as essentially a direct result. We're familiar with stories where people fall in love and it doesn't work, but our culture doesn't do actual tragedy, where just a lot of awful crap happens and no lesson is ever learned. This is a lot different than choosing whether or not to skip in the rain or get up and dance. And that's what this is really all about, thinking if this is really me feeling long term or short term, and even that is so foreign to your way of life it should make the answer obvious. 

Still, you're the only part of high school I'll ever miss.

I knew you liked me, but you didn't ""like like"" me. We were just in middle school and I know you were all over the place with just having fun. You didn't have time to deal with girls. Oh silly girls. 

After you broke my heart, your best friend asked me out. I saw the discomfort in your eyes but what could I say? I told you that I loved you but our feelings weren't equal. After a heated argument, we stopped talking for a year. I reconnected with you and we instantly clicked again! I was super excited. But then, another friend of yours asked me out. I knew your feelings for me had disappeared back in middle school, so I said ""Why the hell not?"" and I went for it. But deep down inside, so desperately and miserably, I wish you'd asked me out.

Still, those feelings occur. I'm still madly in love with you. Over 4 years, I've tried to forget my feelings for you. I've tried to convince myself that there's nothing we can do.

A year ago, I was determined to make you the best year of my life. I had no idea that just a few days later when I would cross the finish line of my first half marathon, I'd simultaneously feel the most empowered and disappointed in my life. So, I decided to make some tough decisions to stop settling. It wasn't easy. I gave up my dog, moved 6 times in less than 8 months, twice into complete strangers' homes and often had no idea where I'd be living the next week. Needless to say, I gave my parents some serious gray hairs. (Sorry about that!) I gave away most of my belongings. I quit stressing about the little things and became much more appreciative of family, friends and the simple fact that I had a roof over my head and a job to support myself. I proved I was much stronger than I ever imagined (Thanks sisu). It wasn't all a struggle though - I discovered I'm a hop head who loves motorcycles, can now drive a manual and for the first time, I'm in a loving, supportive, mature, healthy relationship. (Thanks babe) So, whether you helped move me from house to house, opened your home to me, invited me over for holiday dinners, let me vent, cry, distract myself with gratuitous amounts of Vampire Diaries and The Walking Dead or just gave me the space I needed to decompress, I can't thank you enough. I left NC with many lessons learned, tons of great memories and friends I hope to keep for a lifetime. 

So, 25, you may not have turned out how I imagined, but it was worth the trip. From the Atlantic Ocean in my backyard to
the Rockies, I don't think I'd change a thing or the people who helped me get to the other side ;)

It's been about a month now since I told you I wanted to call it quits; I don't remember exact dates anymore which I think is a good sign of me moving on. 
After we broke up, I decided to take the high ground and not respond to anything. I didn't want to respond to your friends throwing obscenities at me, the friends that I thought were my friends too. I thought they were my best friends actually, and for a while I was bitter that you told them your side of the story so they thought I was the only bad person in this situation. I've realised now that I don't care anymore. I don't care about them, because what happened was between us and will stay that way.

Honestly, I had to lie to myself some days to convince myself we were happy. When we first started I just wanted something fun and casual. I'm a lot younger than you and you never did understand that. It terrified me when I heard that you were planning to surprise me and get a place for us, because I'm not ready for that. I have my own dreams and goals and I always liked the idea of having a person to support me, but the jokes you made about the career I love turned me off greatly. Towards the end, you turned me off too. 

I used to smile when I read your name, now I'm emotionless towards it. Sometimes I feel a sense of melancholy. At night I wonder what I'd be like if I'd not broken up with you, or if I'd done it sooner. I don't regret my decision, and it makes me laugh that you thought I would. You were always so full of yourself, you and your best friend. I hated how he treated his ex, I hated how both of you practically shunned me when I decided not to keep my mouth shut about it. You told me you didn't know me anymore when I mentioned Feminism, as if that's a monstrous thing; as if I was the monster. You've known me for years, you knew I wasn't bad because you claimed you loved me, so what I guess I'm angry about here is that you thought that was a turning point, and from then on you didn't know what to say to me. Well, I never knew what to say to you. I always was treading on thin ice to not upset you, because I was exhausted from fighting. 

I have a huge problem with depression and self harm, as you know, and when you decided to teach me a 'lesson' about what you would do if I ever fell back into old habits… I realised that was when I no longer loved you. You broke up with me and left me hanging for a week, you had sex with other women and then you wanted me to beg for you to take me back, when I was already fragile enough. Do you realise what that does to a person? It was always a constant mind game, to make me feel like less and you feel like more. You loved it when your ex wanted you back and she argued with me about it, you loved the idea of having two women all over you. I remember that so well, because that was when your best friend didn't treat me like shit and he defended me, although I found out later that was because he was in love with me all along, and when I rejected him, he started ignoring me and making horrible remarks. Some best friend you have there, huh? 

I keep talking about him because you really are both as bad as each other, I realise that now. You both lectured me when I befriended his ex like I was some bad kid for making friends, and at that time I actually let myself be lectured. I let myself stop being friends with that poor girl just because neither of you wanted me to. I let you control my life and getting out of that and the relationship was one of the best things I've ever done for myself. I actually feel free to do what I want now, I won't be scolded for drinking or going out or not being around to talk because I'm a student with work to do. I no longer get made to feel like I'm less that good enough for anyone, because even if that was unintentional, that's how I was made to feel. Towards the end though, I started to feel too good for you. Nobody is perfect though, I just wish I hadn't tried to fool myself into thinking you were at one point. 

So this is my proper goodbye, because when I tried before you told me to fuck off and wouldn't talk. I gave you my online details so you could contact me, but instead you contacted me through your best friend who threw in his own horrible remarks in the process. He wrote a whole blog about how much I'd changed and gave it to me, told me I should be ashamed for making you cry, told me that it was impossible for me to just stop loving you or be unhappy with you, although I wasn't aware he knew anything about our relationship. 

When he finally gave me the message you'd written me, I didn't feel anything at all, again. I didn't feel happy or sad, I just looked at the words and I was almost intrigued. This was your goodbye to me? I wasn't aware you were the one who broke up with me and needed to say goodbye, I remember it being the other way around. You could have said goodbye the first time, but instead you wrote a long blog about how you still cry about me but you're getting better, how you'll always love me, all these things like I'll even care. Then you have to audacity to suggest that the reason I broke up with you was for someone else. It's taken me a month to even talk to another guy, and after what you put me through, making me feel so low that I would self harm and then belittling and scolding me for doing so, I don't want another relationship anytime soon. But you know, if you really cared to know, I'm well. I'm very good. It feels nice to finally say what's on my mind because now I can be at peace with things.

I know it would only happen after you graduated, which would be in nearly 3 years. We were supposed to go and see Europe together, particularly Italy. Then we were supposed to move out and then room together for uni, go clubbing and have hot boyfriends.

But here we are. I got a letter asking me to come for an interview for an exchange to Switzerland. We don't talk any more. The guy I like isn't even attractive, and to be honest, you would probably think I was batshit *insane* for liking him. 

I don't know what I did to you, or why, all I know is that three, nearly four years ago you blocked me on facebook and told one of my friends that you didn't want to be friends with me any more.

It's been four years, and while I don't think about you much at all, there have been moments in my life that I always assumed we would share. When you first got a boyfriend? It still stings that you never told me until you guys broke up. The first time I asked a guy out we hadn't talked for two years. I miss when we would dance around your lounge room to the Young Divas and run around your house in stilettos. You never showed me the pictures of you as a bridesmaid at your brother's wedding. I think they had a kid but I don't know. They could have six kids by now, and I wouldn't know.

But really, the fact that I will (all going well) go overseas next year, without you, stings a little. That one of our plans is coming true, but you're off in your own world and won't even know.

I hope everything goes well for you Katy (or Katerina as you like to be called now. It sounds so much more mature) and you get to go overseas. I hope you get into law (or whatever you want to do now. I don't know) and have a great life.

Sorry that I didn't come back to school after that day. It wasn't because I didn't hear what you said, or understood what you said. It was the absolute opposite. I was ashamed. That school year had started with so many wishes, and promises, and good intentions. I had quit smoking weed, and I was going to work this time. And I did, to begin with. I wasn't always the way you saw me in the end, and I think you must have noticed that. 

You were the best teacher I had. You seemed to understand me, and my potential, instead of just writing me off, due to my previous record, like everybody else. I'm sorry I never told you that. You helped me get into the advanced programs, and suddenly I was getting straight A-s, and I was so proud to surprise everybody. But at the same time, I was drinking too much. Every day. It went fine for a while, I don't think anyone noticed.  It is, however, highly relevant to what happened further on, and I want to explain why. 

Do you remember when I showed up for school with a broken elbow, and two broken knuckles in my other hand? That wasn't an accident. I was completely hammered, and, well, got into a fight. I decided to quit drinking after that. And that, I think, was about the time you started to worry about me. Because that's when the depression came along. I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't go to school. But I had those exams coming up, and I knew I had to do well. Because you said I was the best student! I couldn't disappoint you. You were the only one who I hadn't disappointed yet. I want you to know that I didn't stop going to school because I was lazy. I never got to explain that. 

When the exam came around, I was panicking. So I started taking drugs. Amphetamines. First only ADD-meds, but when I couldn't get those anymore, street-grade amphetamines. I was awake for almost three weeks straight before the final. And I did alright, I think. But afterwards, I couldn't quit. I don't remember much, except that the few times I showed up for school, I would go to the bathroom hourly to take some more. Then came the next big exam. And I panicked even worse. Because now the Amphetamines didn't work like they did in the beginning. So I took too much. Way too much. 

But you know that. Because I literally wasn't able to speak during the presentation. And you pulled me over, and talked to me. My god, it was terrible. You seemed so disappointed. Almost personally offended, and betrayed. You told me I couldn't do this anymore, that I was going to fail the year, and that you couldn't understand why I was doing what I did. I just walked out on you. Not because I didn't care, or didn't want to listen! But because I couldn't speak, and I was starting to cry. 

That's the last time I saw you. I didn't come back to school at all. I didn't even bother to drop out. I just... stayed away. I was so embarrassed and I felt so incredibly guilty. And I knew there was no coming back from that. 

So I want you to know: I didn't just brush off what you said. I'm not lying in a ditch dead from an overdose somewhere. I'm not a druggie, and I'm not completely ruined. I'm now two years clean, and trying to get my GED, while working. Then, I want to go to a good university, and study. And I want to thank you for that. You made me believe, back then, that I could do something. You were the only one to speak up when I was at my worst, because everyone else was expecting me to end up that way anyways. 

You saved my life, and you don't even know it. I'm sorry, and I'm eternally grateful. ",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1bmkuv,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1bmkuv/to_my_teacher_long/,

Two  and a half years that my children (your seeds) have flourished.  Two and a half years that I've been happier than I every thought I could possibly be.

When we got married, I honestly think I liked you, not loved you.  As fucked up as that is to admit now, I just really wanted to get away from my parents and their control on my life.  I wanted to be my own person, make my own way without them constantly breathing down my neck.  We had fun together, but I think it was more you were the exact opposite thing my parents really wanted for me and I decided FUCK THEM, I can do what I want.  

That first year was hard and when you left me stranded in Kentucky on our first anniversary, I should have woke up then.  I didn't though, I just had mom come get me and I came to see you at your grandmothers house.  You wanted a divorce.  I wish some days that God would have slapped the piss out of me and said ""HEY STUPID!  HERE'S YOUR CHANCE!  I KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS!!  GET OUT NOW!""  He didn't though and I tried to win you back.  And I succeeded. 

We were happy for a little bit, even though I knew you cheated on me with your cousin's wife, what was her nickname??  The Whore of Montcalm??  Yeah, I'm an intelligent woman, but I made a really dumb choice when I moved back to Kentucky.  I should have cut my losses then.  I didn't and we see what happened.  I stood there and let you choke me, because I thought I loved you.  I let you sit on my stomach and hold me down and slap me across the face because I didn't get you anything to eat from Taco Bell (a restaurant you hated).  I let you kick me out of our bed and into the floor one night because I thought i was in love!  What a fucked-up mess I was!

I supported you while you were active duty.  Supported you when you were training and preparing to go overseas and I lived eight hours away from my family.  Took care of our home and stood by you when others would have crumbled or succumb to temptations.  I was there for you!  I was there when you go hurt, every fucking doctors appointment, catheters, pain clinics, epidurals.  I put you before the kids, having other people take care of them so i could stand by your side while you were at the doctors appointment and hospitals.

Jayden was born and you were so fucking blitzed out of your skull on Loratabs you slept in the corner of the room.  I fucking hated you for that, that memory taints the memory of the hours before the birth of our son!  You were hooked then, I was just to blind to see it.  I knew at that point I was in too far just to walk away.  I had to stay with you, for better or for worse.  

The miscarriage, the death of my daughter...that probably drove the deepest nail into my heart.  All i ever wanted was a daughter and when I lost her because of the stress from your and your stupid addiction, I HATE YOU for that!!!

You cleaned up when Payton was born, trying to be a better man, maybe you grew up, a little.  You were still happy to smoke pot, which is fine.  God knows, I smoked it too.  And I truly believed that maybe our life would be okay.  Not great, but okay.  

Your health declined further and further and there were days were I actually believed i was going to be a widow.  I never told anyone, but I resented you for that.  It wasn't fair.  I grew to hate you.  

I think I finally broke when I could see the signs of your addiction coming back.  Your aggressive behavior, your selfish smug face when the kids would ask to watch TV with you and you would just tell them to go to their room.  They just wanted to spend time with you, and you would send them away. 

I cheated on you and even as I write this, I have a smile on my face.  You drove me to it, because I just couldn't take the pressure eating me anymore.  I hate you!  I HATED YOU more than you can even imagine.  I know it was wrong, and I feel bad for that part.  I shouldn't have done it, but I did.  I fucked two different men, carried on two different relationships at the same while i was married to you.  You knew about Jeff.  But not about Brian.  

The abuse had stopped for a while, but started again once you got pain killers flooding your system again.  I remember the feeling of shock when you tripped me one night on the way to get your medication.  The way I felt when you slammed my head into the wall in the bathroom.  The way the word CUNT peeled off your lips and into my ears. The feel of the bed shaking when you came in and kicked it to wake me up at three in the morning.   The way your eyes looked when you told me you were going to blow a hole through my head if I didn't move from infront of the television.  My kids remember that too and even though they love you and forgive you, I can't.

I'm happy I finally grew a back bone and divorced your stupid ass.  I'm happy you only see the boys once or twice a month, I'm happy that your fucking dying and can't wait until you do.  I'm not a bad person, but sometimes bad shit comes out of my mouth.  I should have let you overdose, should have just let you have at the drugs you wanted to feed yourself, instead I was a decent human being and controlled them as best I could.    

Yeah, I shouldn't have cheated, but you broke me.  Now, I have finally found the MAN that mends me.  He is my everything, the light in the darkest places, my protector when I need one, my partner.  I love him, like I never loved you.  ",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1b91c2,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1b91c2/dear_exhusband_and_the_sperm_donor_of_my_children/,

And I'll be kind, and sweet, and joyful and you; you'll be miserable, and sarcastic and bitter. I know you though. And you know me, so well. Neither of us mean it. I am the things you bring out in me, and you are what I bring out in you. We're just finally ourselves.

And oh what I wouldn't give, the things I would do and say. I could waste hours of every day in anticipation of your smile, that perfect cacophony that beats against my chest and wills me, demands me to see all that is happy. Every time your beautiful sculpted, graceful hands glance against me I yearn to run those fingers against my cheek and stare in to your eyes and see it. See that you feel something. Anything. I could sit and watch you for God knows how long, just watch you. Stare and wonder as those eyes light up at simple pleasures, at those teeth that gleam in your face, at the wonderful way you weave your hands through the air as you talk to me.

I could wait forever for you. Your magnificence astounds me. I am pure, complete water around you. I melt. Just being near you as you squint down at me and laugh, insult me in your half hearted attempt to pretend that that hug didn't last too long. That the peck on the lips was pure friendship. That the night you spent in my arms where we fit, we just fit. That it was nothing. 

It can never work. You are not mine, and you never will be because you belong to someone else. Someone who I have no right to take you from, I can't and I won't, even if I could. And soon, I leave you for good. There's no place for me in this country and why would I ever return? Except for you. If you asked I would reach across the sea that separates us just to hold your hand. A tiny, little, pixie like spark of magic is all that could ever make this possible but the all encompassing shattering truth of reality means this will never be anything more than this letter I can never let you see. I have to leave. I have to leave here, and you, and this fantasy behind. I suppose all I can hope is one day I find someone as perfect as you.

Maybe they will give me what I can never have from you, just one night. What I wouldn't do for one night to be her. I'm not though, and so it makes perfect sense to just let you go. We're only friends anyway. I have to leave anyway. I have to leave you.

I apologize in advance if this seems a little scattered. I'm going off the cuff here.

I had a dream about you last night. It happens more often than I'd like to admit. You were dressed in sexy party clothes. You know how I always liked to see you, always somewhat understated but always managed to tease just enough to get me to think about you non-stop. We were chatting and entertaining our guests and you put your left hand over me, and I swear on my bottom dollar that I could really feel your soft hand gently find its way across my back as you gently rubbed my shoulders just like you used to. My heart had predictably skipped a beat and you got me to make a coy smile and laugh a little. Again, predictable as usual, but I still wasn't able to stifle how I reacted because I just loved you too much to do anything about how I reacted like a teenager to anything nice you did with me.

Then I woke up from this wonderful dream.

This could have been my reality to this day. This could have been what I experienced with you every single day. The kissing, the sex, the way I couldn't get enough of running my lips fingertips up and down your body for hours, the way we'd run around movie theaters to catch all the latest releases, the way I'd win you carnival prizes, the way we would spend time on the beach getting drunk and eating California burritos, the way we would cheer each other on about each other's futures, and our inside jokes.

It would have been easier if you weren't so terrible to me in the beginning. The obvious lies. The hooking up with other guys and lying about it to me was the worst. The way my friends insisted that you were playing me as a sucker. My denial. I hated that. We split up, then years later tried to make it work again. You matured, but I wasn't able to forgive you. It sucked. I *wanted* to. I really did. But every time you would talk about anything related to sex and relationships all you did was bring up those memories of when I caught you in your lies and was reminded of how capable you were of such blatant dishonesty. As sure as I was that you could be a good person to me, I just couldn't get over the past. And I acted like an unbearable jackass, a total bummer, for it and paid the price again of things ending.

I really threw caution and rationality to the wind when we first met. When we kissed that first time... goddamn. It changed me forever. I don't think that there are many pivotal moments in my life that changed it the way it had when you kissed me. I still think about the way that your lips feel, today. The way you'd put your arms around the back of my neck when we kissed. The way we'd chat for hours about *everything*. The time we had together, as much as it sucked sometimes, was some of the best and influential I've had in my life. I miss you. I know we probably could never make it work at this point because of our respective histories, but I would love to catch up. See how you're doing. Let you know that I'm doing well. Hear that you're doing well, too, because I want that for you.

I don't talk about you to people because it would sound pathetic. You're supposed to be *over* people after this much time. But I'm not. I just hide it. I hate having to hide it like this. I cannot stand that we don't talk. I tried a couple times, but I don't want to be *that* guy, so instead I just try to be understanding.

That WAS what I was going to do.  Not anymore.  You like to argue with people just for the sake of arguing.  There is no reason to constantly have the opposite opinion of everyone else.

It was unexpected, standing under the mistletoe at that high school Christmas party. Your girlfriend was watching when you put your hands in my hair, kissed my lips, and nuzzled into my neck while I pretended to protest. The guy I liked was watching too. It was terrible and wonderful. You were my first taste of how good it felt to be bad. I don’t know you anymore, but I know you finally came out of the closet. You’re fabulous for so many reasons. 

To J: You toyed with my heart, and I loved every minute of it. As my manager at a crappy fast food job, there was minimal professional distance. We flirted—and don’t deny that you flirted. It was thrilling to know you would sneak out the back door when I left just to scare me while I walked to my car. Every time. And you waited for me to go in the freezer so you could turn off the lights and hold the door closed and listen to my giggle-choked scream. It was cruel fun. What was crueler, though, was when I confessed my obvious feelings for you, and you didn’t feel the same. Luckily I got fired shortly after that, and you’ll live on in my heart as the guy I kind of, sort of, almost acted like a psycho over when I was sixteen.

To T1: You made me feel needed. And you really needed me. It was terrifying to me that someone I’d never met in person could feel so strongly about me, about us. You wanted to know what I was doing, what I was thinking, what I would say to you if you were in front of me. I would’ve said “Shhh.” I felt that ache in my chest for you, but I think it was sympathy. You were in love with me—how could you love me when I evaded you?—and I tried so hard to be in love with you. But I just wasn’t. We were different people. And I’m going to say the thing I’m not supposed to say: your foot fetish freaked me the fuck out. One picture of my pedicure and you demanded fodder regularly. You were demanding in general. I loved your ardor, but I wasn’t ready for it. I’m sorry for that.

To R: You loved the idea of me. We had barely interacted all semester—and I’d actually been pursuing another guy in our lecture—when you asked me on a date. A proper date. A movie. It was sweet. Despite my hesitations, I decided to stop being phobic about dating and go to see The Dictator with you. You seemed uncomfortable that I laughed so loud at the gross humor. I think I was generally too loud for your taste. You bought me ice cream and interrogated me about my dating history. Then you told me you were not exactly in love with me, but almost. Then you kissed me when I wasn’t expecting it. It was your first kiss. I died a little inside because I knew it meant so much to you and meant so little to me. You insulted me subtly on our dates, but I couldn’t take it seriously because you didn’t know you were doing it—and because I knew I’d break your heart. Your hands on my shoulders felt odd and stiff, like mannequin hands. There was no spark. It wasn’t your fault, but I couldn’t force it for your sake. You were upset, as evidenced by your Facebook statuses. You’ll live, and you’ll love. For real. 

To A: You were an asshat, but you helped me get my groove back. I hadn’t seen you in the two years since high school graduation, but we weren’t friends in high school, so that’s not so unusual. Your Facebook message was unusual. And exciting. I smoked pot for the first time with you, and got way too high. I drank too much, swore too much, got naked under a Snuggie too much during that week of partying last summer. I knew in my gut something was wrong, but I couldn’t fight your hands under the blanket on the couch. I was so drunk, and my best friend was so drunk and lying on the floor with your best friend. We all hated each other in high school, and that surreal moment should have been enough for me to pull your tongue out of my throat and your hand out of my bra. But I pulled you into the bedroom anyway. Your whispered words contrasted with your forceful movements turned me on... You snuggled me tightly all night, but you were cold when I dropped you off in the morning. A future? “Probably not” (I still can’t believe you actually said that) but it was fun. You made me feel sexy—well, I felt sexy after I got over the rage. I hope you stopped wearing Hawaiian shirts ironically, and I hope you’re still a great kisser. 

To T2: You are so imperfect. You’ve been one of my best friends since freshman year and I’ve always harbored a little bit of a crush for you. Your girlfriend hated me. I never did anything, of course, but she hated how we understood each other. We shared our writing, our ideas, our humor. She was so angry when you came to my 21st birthday. I was angry that you came, too, because you had your hand on a girl’s thigh the whole night (dude, she was nasty). Your girlfriend confronted me on campus with tears in her eyes, hoping she’d convince you not to leave her. You didn’t leave her then, but you did eventually. Then she cried to me, fifteen feet from your classroom. She told me everything. Everything. You’re unstable. You’re depressed. You’re throwing your life away. These aren’t things she had to tell me, but she said the things I’d been thinking. There are times when I think there’s something between us, but then I remind myself that I can’t support the immense weight of your existence. I can be your friend; we can still email pieces of writing to each other and bounce around ideas. We can still drink in your car between classes. Yeah, we can definitely do that because that was fun as hell. You’ll still sit too close to me and I’ll still touch your thigh when you say something funny. This is how it will be. 

To Z: You broke my heart, but I deserved it. You came out of nowhere. Seriously, you fell into my world like a meteor into Russia. I never expected to meet someone on a drunken Two-Dollar Tuesday with a couple of friends. You were a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend at that random house that belonged to some friend of a friend of a friend, and I didn’t really give you a second glance—until, around five in the morning, you took my hand. You kissed me on the porch and we both had cottonmouth from drinking and smoking. We shared a glass of water and innumerable kisses. It felt so right to be pressed against you on that dirty leather couch in the living room of some guy whose name I didn’t know. My friend let me stay with you, but he disapproved. I should’ve left with him instead of letting you dig deeper into my head and my heart. Over the next three weeks of Christmas break, I drove the hour to come visit you as often as possible. We kissed deeply, we kissed often. You called me your girl. To everyone you introduced me to, I was your girl. My first instinct was to run—my first instinct is always to run—but I fought it to give us a chance. It was bliss. I don’t know what happened. One day I’m your girl, the next you don’t reply to my texts. You didn’t block me on Facebook or anything like that. I didn’t get angry or crazy, so I guess you thought you could just act like it never happened. It happened, though. Maybe I’m an idiot, but I started to love you in that short amount of time. Certainly there was lust… a lot of it. But there was also love. You were tender and loving and I hate to think that you can fake that. It still hurts to think about the quiet murmuring sound you make and the goofy smile you get when you kiss. You pulled me to you only to dissolve into thin air when I got my arms around you. I inhaled your vapor, and I’m still coming down off the high. I can’t feel anything positive about you yet, except that I now know I can feel strongly for someone. Damn you for making me feel.

That's what you told me. After a year of wishing and hoping you loved me back, you finally said it. I told you I loved you as well. I loved you so much.

And then you left. You fucking left me. You didn't even TELL me. You took off and left. Changed your phone, your email address, everything. I had to work it out by myself. You broke me so completely I became a shell of what I was. I have never felt such gut-wrenching, soul destroying pain. Looking back, I don't know how I survived. Every day was worse than the last. Everyday I woke up, expecting you to be there, before I had to face the reality that you had left. My heart broke everyday. Over and over and over again. 


Eventually I moved on. Two years later. Then you came back. Begging for forgiveness, you wanted me back. But it was too late - I couldn't leave my now-fiance. You've tried to contact me a few times since then, the last time you tried I had just found out I was miscarrying. It was unplanned, but my baby was dead nonetheless. I was in no position to talk to anyone. I regret that now, why didn't I speak to you? I love you so much still. But I was grieving. 

It seems we keep missing each other. When you need to speak to me, I can't speak to you. When I need you, you don't speak to me. 


Enough is enough. I love you. I always have and I always will. I've been so angry with you for so many years. I don't know what I can do anymore. I guess I just have to wait until you come back again.

I am stopping this. I am ending it right now.

I was in the middle of writing a different unsent letter—still to you, and I realized it was just essentially me singing your praises. And like a complete idiot, while I was writing it, I was wondering why I allowed my emotions to be so ruled by you. Why every little thing you do can affect me so much.

Huh, well maybe it's because I put you on a fucking pedestal. Ridiculous and a little bit hypocritical of me, seeing as I'm always the one to tell others not to make people superhuman. Yet here I am, mooning over you! Like some teenage girl. 

You know what? You are amazing. But I'll be damned if you're not also flawed. I'll be damned if you haven't made mistakes. If you haven't fucked up. If there aren't some parts of you that aren't all that heroic and lovable and glorious. 

You're not deserving of my idolization. In fact, it's a disservice to you as much as it is to me. I'm so fucking over tiptoing around you. I'm tired of not telling you how I feel because I worry my world will come crashing down around my ears if you don't feel the same. 

I'm going to tell you how I feel. And if you feel the same, that's great. And if not, I won't die. You're not powerful enough to make my world crash down. You're not more than human.

You were so mean to me.

But, you know, I was no better. I know my intent wasn't malicious, but  in retrospect, I was unsympathetic, impatient, and generally bad to you. Even when I thought I was being good to you, I wasn't.

I have - I swear it, check my pockets and sleeves - no leftover romantic feelings for you. I do not want to rekindle our relationship. It went sour, and when something goes sour, you don't try to fix it, you throw it out. Which is what we did. Good for us.

Still, whenever I think of you, I feel this pang of regret. Like, all the what-ifs come rushing back to me, like *what if* we weren't both so petty, and *what if* our break-up was more civil? Could we actually be talking right now?

I'd say I want to be friends, but I'm not sure I even want that. What I really want is peace. What I want is to not feel like I'm negotiating with foreign diplomats whenever I talk to our mutual friends.

Underneath all of this regret, I admit, is this crippling fear that we'll never reconcile. Like, never. Do you know how much weight that word holds? Infinite weight. Statistically, we don't have that much time left to live, only a few decades. Can you please send me an email before one of us dies?

I'm probably going to quit university. And whilst, if I'm honest, it's *not* because of you, the truth is that it wouldn't be this way if it *weren't* for you. You destroyed my confidence, my self-esteem, my self-worth. And what I'd usually do in this kind of situation is tell you, because you deserve to know that you're a fucking asshole. I know you think you're a good guy, so you need to know you're not, so that maybe you can change before you hurt someone else.

When we all first moved here, you were the first person I hit it off with. I was INCREDIBLY nervous, because I suffer from major social anxiety, and moving to new places and meeting new people had never gone well for me in the past. But we got on well. I felt at home being with you, and our other new friends. I remember thinking that things were finally looking up for me, and that I'd made the right choice.

You kissed me on the bus. I was surprised, but I realised that I liked it. Things progressed - quickly and emotionally, until within a week I was sleeping in your bed and telling you my deepest secrets. 

And I mean, my deepest secrets. That stuff was no fucking joke. I had never told anyone that stuff. I poured my heart out to you. We stayed up all night, just you and me, and we talked about everything and anything. I don't know why I trusted you so much, but I did. I thought you were the nicest boy I'd ever met. You were goofy, sweet, and sensitive. The boys I knew back home were all assholes, but you seemed different. I missed you when I wasn't around you. 

But then that all changed. Two weeks later it becomes apparent you're dating another girl in our building, J. I feel so, so rejected and downtrodden, and used, but because we discussed before how we weren't exclusive I can't do anything about it but stay away from you. I try to talk to our friends about how I'm feeling, but it turns out that, whilst they know all about you and J, you never told them about us. I see the look they give me when I try and explain how hurt I am; they barely believe we were ever more than friends. I am absolutely humiliated. 

I was so angry at you, I couldn't hide it. You were the first person I was ever honest with. I know we moved too fast, but the conversations we had- I thought you cared about me. I guess my lack of experience in the past didn't prepare me for how well some people can lie. But I was so angry, so rejected, so humiliated, and you noticed, and you got angry too, and we screamed at each other, but in the end we had no choice but to make friends again. Because I fucking needed friends. By this point, destroyed as I was, I had no one to talk to. My depression was through the roof. I was suicidal. I needed a friend, even if it was awkward and full of hurt. I needed *someone*. And you seemed so sorry, in the end. You even cried in front of me. I believed you wanted nothing more than to be friends with me.

But it wasn't the same. You were with J wherever I looked and it made me sick. Every time I saw her, all I could think of was how she must be prettier than me, sexier than me, less damaged than me. I felt so sick. When I told you how it made me uncomfortable posing for photos between the two of you, you acted like I was crazy. No, I didn't still like you. My feelings took a blow to the head the second I realised I had been used in such a manner. But still, to see you every day, every goddamn day, and her too- when I had no friends, no friends in the whole city, it was too much for me. I resented you both, because when I was around you I felt like the most worthless thing in the world.

Fuck you, S. You said you cared so much about me, you said all you wanted was for us to be friends, but when the months pass and I slip into a depression so devastating that I'm planning my suicide and I can't leave my own room, where were you? Where was the compassion? I even texted you a couple times but you never replied. Once you IM'd me saying we should catch up, but after a few rounds of your one-word answers to my questions, you stopped replying then, too. You are a fucking asshole, and your actions have ruined me. I told you how sensitive I was, how broken I was. Why would you play games with someone like that? And, why would I forgive someone like that? Am I that weak? Am I that starved for human contact?

Fuck you, S. I'm talking to you right now over instant messenger. I told you that I'm leaving and you said you support my decision. Fuck you so goddamn much.

I have driven here every work day over a 3 hour round trip commute (without counting traffic).  I have worked long and hard hours with nothing to show except written reprimands for acruing overtime.  I have uncovered software problems that were destroying your upper management bonuses.  I have uncovered pricing inconsistencies that were eating profits.  I have gone above my station to take care of customers, vendors, and clients because nobody else would.  I have trained and managed more than a dozen employees when it wasn't my job because YOU refused to provide any sort of training.  I have provided first aid kit supplies from my money because you would not authorize it as a necessary expense.  

You have never done a thing to take care of me.  You have altered time sheets to fake unpaid lunch hours because I was not given the support to take a real lunch.  You have added duties to me without even the illusion of compensation.  You have worked me like a workhorse for 2 years because you could.  You made me quit school because you would not uphold the paperwork I signed saying that I would take this job with the stipulation that I have a consistent enough work schedule to attend classes.  You have chased off any and all of my coworkers that could have taken a little bit of the strain from me.  Every moment of every day you are looking for issues that won't make the business run more smoothly but will pad your pockets.  

I looked for a new job.  Everybody told me I should just be glad to have a job in this economy and to not jeopardize it by looking.  My days of have been spent going to other businesses with my resume and doing interviews.  My hours before sleep have been filled with job hunting online.  I found one.  I found one that is much closer to where I stay.  I found one that will pay me more (instead of the abysmal wage you give me.  How do you justify paying so much below the standard rate for my position and half of what my experience and contribution warrants?).  

They need me to give a 1 week notice instead of the 2 week.  I called and spoke with my supervisor.  She knows and has known that I am leaving and need to find a new position.  She is sad and I feel awful that I'm leaving her like this.  She understands and had going away presents and a lunch for me today.  All of my coworkers at this location are sad to see me go and they believe things are ""going to shit"" soon because of my leaving but they are happy that I have a better opportunity.  

My higher ups are NOT happy.  It is to these people that I write this letter.  You expressed that I'm leaving you ""high and dry""?  I'm leaving my coworkers high and dry...this is true.  I regret the strain I put on them.  I'm not leaving any of you in corporate ""high and dry"".  You will get your work...you'll just work somebody else harder to make up for it.  You have expressed no appreciation for what I've done to help you so these accomplishments should not be missed.  You believe that you have outdone yourself by giving me a .50 raise since you ""do not give raises"".  That 50 cent raise literally did nothing but make up for the lunch hours you've taken from me illegally.  It didn't even put a dent into the overtime you have shaved from my time sheets.

You really blew it with me when you treated me like shit when I told you that I had cancer, said that I was “lying to you” and hurling all sorts of abuse towards me. 

I find it funny how you think that I want to talk to you every time I'm on FB for five minutes. Every time we do chat, you are the most depressing person who misspells everything and doesn't say much of anything in the first place. 

Him: wat u doin

Me: Writing.

Him: cool

Me: What have you been up to?

Him: workin

Me: I see.

Twenty minutes pass. This has been our conversation for months. 

I have very little in common with you other than about five things. Of those five, you have a rudimentary understanding of since you couldn't last two weeks in college. We share none of the same values, the only thing we share is who we're friends with. But even you are fighting with them right now. 

And you know what? Somewhere in my cynical black jaded cold fucking heart thats been through the trenches of cancer and faced my own mortality and the onslaught of shit year after year while still getting shit done: I hope you guys don't reconcile.

You stir the shit pot over the smallest things. You say the stupidest shit that hurts time and time again. Finally, whenever you go through your own shit you depend so much on us and when you ask for advice, you don't listen to it. Repeatedly making the same stupid fucking mistakes year after year after year.

Same shit, different day. 

I hope you guys don't reconcile. 

I guess that makes me a selfish bitch for wanting my friends to be a positive force in my life, not ones that drag me down. I don't have the emotional energy to be your little shit stained cry mop to dry your tears and tell you that you are a good person every time you fall in life.

You haven't done a single fucking thing in your life thats noteworthy. If it makes me a fucking hosebeast to want to be around the people who are doing things with their lives, then so be it.

Just take the hint whenever I just pop back offline that I don't want to talk to you. It would make life so much easier. ",,False,,t5_2seir,1347780493.0,,,True,t3_zyosc,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/zyosc/please_stop_messaging_me_every_time_i_get_on/,

Mainly, what I need to say is that I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that I let my fears destroy what we had. I'm sorry that my reaction to problems was to withdraw into my own head. I'm sorry that I let all of my insecurities and worries cloud and colour my view of our relationship.  I'm sorry I couldn't give words to the feelings and emotions I was going through, and I'm sorry that I gave up on everything we had built together without offering you a voice in that choice, let alone a chance to fix or change what was going on.

I try and I try and I try and you don't care. It comes down to you not loving me enough. Plain and simple.

I would've done anything to be with you. I moved across the country twice to be with you. I surprised you for your birthday less than a month ago for a weekend getaway. I thought about you every day. I loved being with you, just watching a movie or being lazy. I loved cooking for you. I loved living with you. 

I try and I try and I try and I am never good enough for you. You broke up with me a year and a half ago for having no ""work eithic"" and no direction. We got back together. Now I have a great job and am starting grad school and yet you still dump me again. Now I have direction and it's still not good enough. You call me selfish, you call me self-possessed. Does that make you feel better blaming it all on me? I accepted you despite your faults, why couldn't you do the same? I didn't know these issues were still bothering you...and you call me uncommunicative. 

You'll never find anyone who loved you as much as I did. I know someday I'll find someone who loves me more than you ever did though.

I've lost 6 pounds already, in the span of 5 days. I need pills to sleep at night. I'm an empty shell. I went to therapy this morning and cried my eyes out. I can't believe we still have to live together through this. You knew I didn't know if my job would become permanent until next month. You knew I was starting grad school in a few weeks. You knew I had to take my car into the shop and had no ride to work except for you. You knew all this and you still dumped me. I'm so hurt. I'm so angry.

Darling, if you were here we wouldn't have slept. We would have stayed up all night cuddling and kissing, talking and laughing and playing, probably having sex a time or two, enjoying each other and just living. We might have taken a nap as the sun rose and woke up to butterfly kisses and bitten lips shortly after. We may have taken a shower together, washed each other's backs and played in the water. Savoring the moment and time and fun. We probably would have made breakfast together. Maybe have a sword fight with the spoons and chasing each other with batter. Licking and kissing it off our faces afterwards. You would have kissed me goodbye as I left for work. A long, deep, I-wish-you-didn't-have-to-go kiss. But it's okay, I'd be back in a couple hours. So you'd rest and wait, and I'd work and hurry. Maybe we'd take another nap together on the couch when I got home. Play a game of Life when we woke up, which you would win because I suck at that game. Go for a walk hand-in-hand and push each other on the swings at the park up the road. We might even get a little nostalgia to play hide-n-seek while we're there. We could go eat lunch at a little dinner downtown. Stop in at that comic book store I've been dying to go to on the way back home. We could cuddle on the couch, watch a movie, and steal kisses during the boring parts. Which comparatively would be all of it. Maybe we'd get that glint of mischief in our eyes and play a little strip poker. It doesn't matter who wins, because we both win. After a little trouble, a little fun, a few thousand kisses later, maybe we'll try to think of an idea for our own comic book. Find a plot and attempt to draw out the panels. Who knows how far we can get on that. Maybe we'll lie on the floor together and talk about the future. What we want. What we wish. What we hope. We'll probably start a tickle fight to lighten the mood back up. We'll probably go make supper together and get messy. Maybe we'll make spaghetti and eat it like Lady and the Tramp. You'll give me the puppy dog face and another long, deep, I-really-wish-you-didn't-have-to-go-right-now kiss as I leave for work again. I promise you when I get back I'm all yours for the whole night. You'll hang out and wait, I'll go to work and hurry. Drive like a mad woman back home because I can't wait to be back in your arms. I'll run and tackle you to the ground when I get home. Kiss you until we both run out of breath. Lay on top of you for a bit and ask how much you missed me. Maybe I'll put on a lingerie fashion show for you. Take time in between each outfit to kiss you all over. Maybe we'll turn off the lights and light up the candles and dance to no music in the middle of my room. Maybe we'll make love and fall asleep in each other's arms.

when i was forced to break contact with you, my world stopped. i was crushed, but i swore that this wasn't the end. how could i let go of someone entirely like that, someone who meant the world? not possible. i swore we'd meet again, and in the meantime, that i'd make you proud. i strove to be as you were, to be a person you could truly say had done something. this was misguided, and i realize that now, yet at the time, it was everything; it was all that kept me going. it was the source of so much angst, yet it was my life for the year after we had our chance friendship.

here i am, though, two and a half years later, and i've realized so much. i know now the way that you would truly be proud of me is to not idolize. i cannot aspire to be like you, because you taught me to be an individual in the deepest sense. i don't need you; you are not my life goal. i have beliefs, purposes, and truths that are my own, that i have developed myself, that do not revolve around you, and this is why i believe you would be proud of the person i am today. the fact that i can disagree with you on some things is something i'm oddly quite proud of.

the poetry of this stands out to me; the way everything so perfectly fell into place. i met you at the age when i was precisely the most innocent and also the most twisted, and while losing you hurt so much, it was for the best as i was able to grow and create myself without you. i picked a name out of a textbook, and it changed my life forever. a stark atheist, i don't believe in miracles, but i want to believe this is what true beauty and meaning looks like.

i still hope to find you again one day, not because i need you, but because you were a true friend. you were the one person who i have connected to on a level i didn't know existed. you're a mind that is something special, and that is something to fight for. i want closure, and i want a friend. they're rare to come across nowadays.

maybe someday i'll be able to tell all this to you, but for now, this is all i have. wherever you are, i want you to know that you were always my hero and i'll never forget on you. your effect on me has been too powerful for words. it has been absolute happiness, and crushing sadness. it has been a connection to true experience and humanity, and that is a thing i can't thank you enough for.

A summer of love, perhaps it was just an illusion, perhaps I don't know what love really is, nevertheless, it was I summer I cannot forgot.
Now that summer is over, we've returned to school, to classes, to homework, to friends we had left behind and now nothing is the same.

I don't know why I can't forget you. What was it about those fleeting months that burned you into my mind? Was it that beautiful brown hair or those amazing brown eyes? 
Every time I lay in bed or have a quick moment of thought under the shower's warm rain you are instantly there. How could a first kiss bind me to you so? And every time these thoughts flash across my mind I'm filled with the deepest of regret; I had such a chance and I wasted it away.

Perhaps I could blame it on my lack of experience with relationships, or that you were busy all the time; after all, so was I. Yet I can't help but come to the same conclusion each and every time: It was my fault, this could have been wonderful but I let you pass me by. I didn't ask to spend time with you enough, or be spontaneous enough, or be romantic enough. I said I was all these things, yet as soon as we spent time together in person my fear of the unknown cast all these thoughts aside.

I'm sorry. 
You said you were waiting for your first kiss to be with the perfect guy, I stole that from you.

It's been months now, we pass each other in the halls nearly everyday yet neither of us can bring ourselves to look the other in the eye. Whenever we see each other we instantly do something to act like we don't notice the other. Suddenly there is a text message to check, a window to look out, an acquaintance we barely know to talk to; anything to just not look at the other. What a cruel end to something with so much possibility, it tears me apart.
I didn't let you know enough that you were everything to me, losing you has made me a colder, more reclusive person now. You had started to break down my walls and now that you're gone I've rebuilt them higher than ever. 

I did send one letter many months ago, though. I thought that by admitting my fears and failures I was be able to move on.You said everything was fine, you didn't hate me, you didn't think any less of me, yet, I can't help but wonder what you would say if I could summon the courage to talk to you again. In person this time. 
Do you feel the same pain that I do or am I just that ex you awkwardly have to see all the time?

I don't believe in fairy tails, happily ever afters, or that somehow some god will make things right. I don't know what I believe anymore

You completely broke me and the thing is... you don't even care or are so self absorbed that you don't even know that you did it.

I was sixteen years old. I was vulnerable, a child, and you... broke me like a toy, like a doll. Ripped me right in half and didn't even notice. I wanted to eat my little microwave pizza and you... IT was slow at first. Your botched attempt to woo me I guess... But you kept pushing and pushing... I was whimpering, I didn't want to do it I didn't want this to happen.... but you twisted my mind, your breath scalded my flesh.... I remember it was cold and then you were so hot... burnt me to a crisp and threw me away like something dirty and spoiled.

I was pure once, before you got your paws on me, inside me, you ripped me apart. I nearly killed myself... I could have died but you got most of what you wanted. I eventually found my voice. Said no. But it was too late. The screams I should have yelled five years ago are still boiling in my stomach like acid. Still waiting to force themselves up, scalding my throat, still wanted to blast apart my lips and burn you to the ground. I'm a volcano and I can only erupt with the word no and still I'm too scared.

I let this happen. How could I let you do that to me? I was sixteen. I knew that maybe if I screamed then you would stop. You forced your ravenous soul inside me and told me I liked it, that this was what *I* wanted. Your filthy hands spreading your filthy soul in mine. Forceful kisses burn me and cap my mouth to keep me from crying. You are ten years my senior but as good as the dead. Your soul can't ever have been pure. You left your mark on me, fingers sliding in my panties, mouth searching, licking, teeth brushing against my nipples.

Was it worth it. Steal a girl's innocence and throw her away like a dirty rag. I'm dirty from your hands, from your words and you presume to judge me a whore? And still I would not tell you. Acted as if you were a friend. Went to your wedding. Met your wife. Held your child during the ceremony.

She knew though, your wife, the woman who presumed to call me a whore two years later. When I dated your friend I knew that he and she used to be something. But I thought maybe he wasn't like you and he wasn't but he was a casualty of war when your wife called me a whore when you called me a whore when the world called me a whore for liking older men because my mind was so bent and broken, my eyes no longer clear, they were hidden by the grime and crap you spread on my soul.

Clipped my wings, caged birds may sing but to me this body is a jail. Cut off my curls, slice into my breasts, slit my wrists, how could I let you do this to me? It's my fault right. I never said the word no and that....that is your saving grace isn't it? Because I did not push you away because I was too weak, too young, too scared.... too dead on the inside to do what could have saved me. I've spared you lifetimes of pain because I never shared it all.

I've saved you because what am I supposed to do, it'd just make me a killer too, and if not me someone acting on my behalf. I may still be walking around but you killed me that night. All I wanted was my little microwaved pizza. You molested me you fucking bastard. You broke the law and I let you walk free. What the hell does that make me then? I can't go back now and say, hey, when I was sixteen this guy took advantage of me can you please arrest him. I have no case and that is your saving grace.

You ripped me apart like I was a rag doll tossed me aside when I finally said enough and you killed my soul. I keep saying I'm fine but I can't help but feel your hellfire breath on my breasts, the feel as your hand slid into my panties and pulled the fucking trigger on me. I'm dead. You still hold it over my head like some gruesome prize...You don't know what you did, do you?

You think I'm a whore for not fucking you, well fuck you, and fuck your wife and fuck your saving grace... I may not have said no... I may not have screamed, but I was SIXTEEN.

It's been four years since you killed yourself. It's hard to believe it's been so long, yet I still can't forget the sight of you laying there that day. I have nightmares of the blood on the floor and that gun laying next to you(Doc tells me that is the PTSD). I don't remember anything after finding you, But your father told me that I had the gun to my head when he got there. He said, That the police thought I'd killed you at first because I had your blood all over me as well. It only seemed fitting in the end that I had your blood on my hands, at first. For years, I've thought I'd missed something. For years, I've only been able to see your blood when I looked at my hands. But, I've finally come to terms with it. I don't think I'll ever really 'get over it', But I've learned to atleast live with it just tucked away in the back of my mind. 

Sometimes, I just wish I could remember something other then that day when I see your grave. I know I haven't visited often since I moved away, But I just had to get out of that town. Everything in it reminds me of you, of that day. I know you left that letter for me, But I've never gotten threw it all. Everytime I try, I get to where you ask me to forgive you, and I lose it. You never did anything wrong, you were never anything but perfect to me. If I anything I should be thanking you. If you hadn't confessed to me on that Christmas day, I'd have never known that you felt that way. I mean we were so close ever since we were little, But it never really crossed my mind. Guess I've never really been one for picking up signals. Which mostly still hold true today. 

I've been in a couple relationships since you left, but nothing has ever gone anywhere. It's odd, I just can't look at another girl the way I used to look at you. I just can't seem to love someone the way I loved you. So it always end with me leaving them, because it's not fair to them. I just wish you were still here so I wouldn't have to even worry about it. I just wish we could be together again. Ya know, I really do miss you like crazy sometimes.

I hate you. I hate what you did to me. What you made me become. B, you were first. You and I really had something, you know? We really did. The way you would hold me, tell me you loved me. And then, one day, you started to say these strange things. I smiled too much. I was too fat. Too ugly. So, I started to smile a little less, laugh less, and eat less. When I ate, I threw it up. You liked me skinny, and you didn’t care how I got that way.  But then you started calling me these names. Bitch. Whore. Cunt. Stupid motherfucking slut. I still hear echoes of this today. You called me these awful names, then a few minutes later called me sweetheart. I started going numb. You made me feel special and worthless all at the same time. And then you told me I couldn’t be friends with my best friend. I remember that last argument. You wanted to know if I was sucking his cock after school. No. We were planning a birthday party, actually.  I told you I couldn’t give up his friendship. You called me a whore, pushed me into the door frame, slapped me, called me a slut. Grabbed my boobs, squeezing them hard enough to leave handprints for a week or more. You asked if that’s what I let him do. I told you we were through. You grabbed my arm, but I wrenched free. I started to leave, and I almost fell down the stairs. While I was tottering on the edge, you reached as if to help me balance, but you had that look in your eyes. That look you got that made me hate myself so much. You didn’t help me… you pushed me. I covered the bruises. I never turned you in. I was so numb for the next year of my life. I continued throwing up. I started cutting myself, burning myself. Feeling pain was better than nothing.

One day, I stopped. I just stopped. I wanted to be alive again.

Over a year later, I met N. You made me feel good. I was away at school, and everything was finally going to be okay. I had escaped my past, and I was going to fall in love and grow into a strong woman. You kissed me one day, right after you broke up with your girlfriend. You said you needed time to get over her and I gave you time. A few days later, you kissed me again – we had been cuddling on my bed. The rest is my fault... I know it. You kissed me aggressively and asked what I was thinking. I said it was nothing. You smacked your head against mine. Hard. I said not to do that. So you started kissing me again. I didn’t want it. I asked you to stop. You pushed me so I was lying down all the way on the bed. I asked you to stop. You got on top of me, spread my legs. I told you to stop. You put your hand in my crotch and started rubbing. My roommate started coming in the door. You jumped off me and left. I didn’t tell her. I just let you go. A few days later, we were talking and you called me a bitch. Twice. Knowing what I had been through before. I started to relapse immediately. B’s voice grew louder in my head. I had to fight to keep food down. I started harming myself, just a little. I got myself back in check in a couple months. I felt stupid, fragile.

How could you bastards do this to me? I hate you.  I hate you. I hate you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I   fucking hate you. I hate you more than I hate war. I hate you more than I hate being alive. I hate you more than I love everyone else. And that’s an awful lot, Fuckers.

You might treat me like this shattered person with fucked up problems, not someone you want to have an intimate relationship with. I know that with you living a state away from me, it makes it difficult for this sort of thing to work out. Sometimes I fear that you won’t care about me as much as I care about you, and I don’t want to know that if that is true. You know how you said you can get people to feel comfortable enough to get people to tell you things? You definitely have that quality about you. I don’t know how you got me to trust you, or it might of just been about the first time I tried to open myself up to anyone in a while. I’ve told you more things then I ever imagined I would. I hope what I tell you now doesn’t change the way you feel about me, whatever that may be. But you probably should know. 

I have been sexually assaulted, on two different occasions. That night that guy followed me to my apartment? The real reason why I have that pepper spray on my keychain and why I hardly drink anymore? He didn’t just follow me. He forced himself on me. Only one person in the world knows about this and it was my good friend, *Natalie, that I confessed to. He walked himself inside my apartment, while my best friend/roommate, *Beth, and our mutual friend, *Dan, were there, sleeping, and I didn’t even know. They left me way back at the bar. I was really fucked up because I drank too much. I don’t even know when exactly and for how long he followed me. My friends that left me didn't even care where I was. They went to bed and had no clue what happened to me; never tried finding or calling me. They even stopped to get food before coming back. The guy bashed my head into the bathroom sink. After I realized he was raping me, I didn’t even know what to do, I had no rationality. I was so terrified and I felt helpless. Finally he left me alone and left. In that moment, I felt like a piece of used garbage. It makes me sick to my stomach to think about it. And I'm pretty sure he lives in the same apartment complex as me. 

The other time was when I was on vacation this past summer, the real reason why I hated the trip so much. This guy cornered me and I lost my friends. Beth does know about this one but doesn‘t take it seriously, and our friend that went on the trip with us,*Lisa, always brings it up and treats it like a joke. I cringe when I think about it. And I shake even worse for some reason when I think about it, more than the other one. I see his face and I become weak. I want to puke. The memories haunt me at least once every day.

I’m sorry for telling you about this. Although I am over my ex, it involved a long recovery. The first cut is the deepest, especially when you look back and see that your first experience with love was a total nightmare and nothing but pain. He used me, put me on the shelf when he didn’t want me and took me down when he did. He was the only person I ever fell in love with. I broke down and confessed this delicate, fragile feeling to him, only to be told flat out that he never felt that way about me. I’m afraid of that again. No one has ever been in love with me before. Or at least no one has ever told me so. I want to feel that way for you but I am scared. I don’t want to become more broken. And I hope you never find this letter. I’m not sure I could look at you after you know. I don’t want you to start looking at me like a bird who broke its wings, even though that’s why I feel like.

I really don't know what it is I want to say, but I just want to say something.

Before I met you I was pretty sure where I was headed. I was self-loathing and terribly insecure; I didn't think I could impress anyone, certainly. I was pretty adamant about the fact that I was absolutely sure that teenagers couldn't fall in love; karma is a bitch, I guess, and decided to make a hypocrite out of me, because God. Just a few fucking weeks talking to you and I was already hooked. You're a goddamn drug.

Of course, it was a little off-putting that you're a bit young for me but I didn't think anything would have ever come of my little crush on you anyways, so I put it aside. You were (are? Should I speak in present tense? I don't know.) one of the smartest freshmen I'd ever met, even if you didn't put yourself into your school work. You were witty, you were funny. You got my humour. You understood my penchant for using British English and it was those little things that drew me to you. How lucky I was that you randomly decided that you didn't know enough of your facebook friends and doggone it you were going to talk to me even if you didn't know who I was. (I realize that last sentence made this whole thing seem way less...impressive, I suppose. I don't give two shits.)

You apparently didn't think so about yourself, but I've gotta say this too: you're pretty fucking hot. That's probably the biggest thing that confused me when I finally got it out that I liked you and you managed to say you liked me back (after a few hours) - how does somebody so perfect and HOT go for someone like me? I mean, it angered you when I TOLD you that you were perfect to me. I don't know why. But you got so pissed off, and I just didn't understand. I had no idea how else to tell you that no, really, you're absolutely perfect. Everything about you. 

You're damn distracting. Even before I told you that I liked you, I'd sit in class and daydream. Sometimes it was simple, just holding your hand or cuddling. Sometimes making out. I may have a very forward-thinking imagination, but I sometimes daydreamed that we lived together some time in the future; that was probably just cause I never got to see you much when we live with our parents. Fuck, now I'm thinking about it again. 

When you told me you were diabetic I was devastated. And now I'm sitting here caring about a disease that doesn't have anything to do with me; I'm not Type 1. I have no reason to care about Type 1 now, except that you have it. Now I can't even read a damn article about diabetes without getting excited for a possible cure just because I want to hold on to you a little longer.

I know it probably isn't healthy to think about you this much, but a year of development just...gone? One month into our relationship YOU were the one saying you loved me, and I had to tell you that it was a bit early. I had to tell you, feel guilty when you said I made you cry, and then show you that immaturity was both natural and expected in these sorts of situations cause you've got to start off somewhere. But even though I convinced you that 'love' was not ready, you kept suggesting it. Just hints. And I finally gave in. Because you really made me love you. Because you made me go against everything I've warned myself against for years. You made me open up to someone and offer my whole heart even though I'd been raised to trust and love no body; I guess you didn't understand that part.

Because you fucking decided a few months later to tell me that you don't know if you ever fucking loved me. You said maybe you weren't ready. You didn't know what  you were doing. You don't think the relationship is worth it anymore because  your fucking mom is getting suspicious about you being gay. What the fuck do you think I was dealing with for the past few months? You'd get mad at me when I would say anything that implied that I cared more. Guess what? It was fucking true. I shouldn't have given you all that trust, all that love; I shouldn't have devoted myself to you so much because now here we are: you don't want to be friends, you want to be friends, you don't want to talk to me because you're being irritable, it's not because of me, but not talking to me will make you less irritable, you aren't ready for a relationship and you don't want to lead me on, but by the way, you still have feelings for me. What the FUCK am I supposed to think? Do you honestly believe that saying all of this shit is helping me? It fucking isn't. It HURTS. SO. MUCH. Because I DON'T want to admit it, I don't want it to be true - but I still love you like hell. You can't give me a straight fucking answer.

To be honest, I don't want you to ever answer that question, because I want so damn much for you to still want me. I want to be your first kiss. I want to take you out and make your day and do all those things that normal couples who aren't hiding in the closet get to do. But you can't be bothered to just try and hide this shit from your mom like I've been doing for the past six months? Even though she's told you that she'd be okay with you being gay? Even though you promised that you'd tell her during the summer? That's a piece of crap.

I know you were frustrated. You didn't like that it didn't feel real, that we could barely see each other between balancing hiding the fact that we were meeting from our parents and going to different schools. Between my abusive dad and your being grounded all the time (that's entirely your fault, stop fucking acting out) we got to see each other a total of four times. Sure, we skyped for AGES during the summer. But that's just not the same. And now that the school year's started, you can't get online late anymore (that's my fault for keeping you up.) You don't have a phone anymore because you're too stubborn to take the F in Chemistry and decided to cheat with your recently-granted texting (even though your mom was already unhappy with how often you texted me late into the night.) You can't go out because you don't have a phone. I'd like to say it's not your fault that we stopped being able to see each other, but it's your fault that we stopped being able to see each other. I am holding that grudge.

I hate you because I just can't stop loving you. I hate that you haunt all my dreams. I hate that every time I close my eyes I imagine you in front of me, tangible, real, happy - I imagine you telling me that you're willing to do this. You'll tell your mom that you're bisexual and date me. You'd switch to my school - anything, really. I get so happy. And I wake up and realize no, you didn't say any of that. In fact, you barely speak to me. When you do, of course, you lead me on like a fucking psycho, manipulative bitch. I can't help that I love you. I can't help that I think you're the most beautiful damn girl in the world. I can't help that I find all your quirks, your interests, your likes and dislikes, your habits, I can't help that I love them all. 

So, I guess I what I really want to say is this: Fuck you for making me want to give you the damn world.

Signed,

Your ex-girlfriend (?)

To not miss you, not want you, not love you. My chest aches when you cross my mind. I still cry huge tear drops when I think about you, they just dry up faster. I guess that's a good thing. 

I've never been so lost, and hurt. I've never just blatantly not understood at all. You disappeared on me. You cut me off without any reason. I told you I could find it in me to let you go so you could figure things out. I never dreamed you wouldn't acknowledge me ever again. I can't believe I had to blow up your phone to get a text messages telling me not to contact you again. 

I know you had to have something going on, but I swear to God I don't know what it was. I swear I would have done anything I could have. And obviously, you knew I couldn't help. But, I don't understand. I don't know what to do. I never thought I was innocent or naive, but something in me died through this experience. I'm angry. I don't believe in love. I don't believe in people. I trusted you more than anyone I have ever met. I was convinced we had something real. But. I was wrong. I had to have been, but it still doesn't feel like it was wrong. I was never unhappy with you. I was never angry at you. Even now, I'm not mad. I just hurt. And I ache. And it's been 7 months. 

I can't make this stop. I just want it to fucking stop. I haven't let myself really cry in a while, and I hate that I am now. But, I need closure. I need answers that I'm never going to get. How could you? Where did I start thinking you were someone you weren't? It's like I never knew you. But, it feels like you're not acting like you. Even if I'm obviously wrong about who you were. If that makes sense. 

The love I had was the purest thing I've known. I've never felt connected to someone like that. It terrifies me that I could be that into someone who wasn't into me. I'm not desperate. I don't think I'm crazy. So, how didn't I see it? My brain function is gone. It's like I do that dumbest things. I had everything in order, my head was on straight. And now I'm a mess. I'm still a fucking mess and I don't have what it takes to clean it up. 

I hate you. and I love you. ANd I miss you. And I never want to see you again. Thinking about you gives me that pain that takes your breath away and makes you feel like you can't swallow. Where your heart beats really fast but you're stunned so you can't move. How long can that really last? 

I was convinced I would be with you for the rest of my life and I'm not that kind of girl. I'd have married you. I'd moved wherever you needed to go. I'd have had kids with you. All the things I swore I'd never do, I wanted to do with you. 

I really hope that something clicks for me one day. I really hope that you have the decency to realize how much pain you've caused me. I don't want you to be miserable, but. I want you to know.

That was the last thing you posted on your FB before you passed away. I had no idea what it meant when I read it, but now I think about it everyday....meditate on it even. 

I'm so sorry for not being stronger and working things out instead of losing touch over the months. You were so sick, in and out of the hospital constantly. I didn't have the heart to tell you while you were hooked up to those machines in ICU that there were mysterious women calling the house for your husband when you were gone.

Instead I lashed out. I bumped heads with your friends, and family members. One day I just couldn't bear to see you so weak anymore and I broke down at the hospital. You didn't know it, but your mom said I had to get out of the house because she didn't want the kids to see me pregnant. I was feeling weak so I confided in one of your best friends at the hospital that night everything, including how women had called the house at night looking for your husband- and how he would disappear telling us he was coming to visit you....and when we showed up to the hospital he was nowhere to be found.

I thought I was protecting you by keeping all this from you while you recovered. Instead what happened was your friend who said I could ""trust"" her basically told you EVERYTHING I said. 

I'll never forget the last time I saw you. You were in the hospital bed, there were flowers everywhere and get well soon gifts. Your facial expression still burns in my memory. You were smiling when I walked in the room, then you caught sight of me. The smile melted from your face. I was so pissed that you would look at me that way. I was so hurt from everything I disconnected from the family and moved to PA.

A year later you told me things got worse. You told me they amputated both your legs and that you had a stroke paralyzing half your body. You knew I was in town and I didn't stop by. God how I wish I would have had the balls to knock on the door and see you one last time. Truth be told I just felt betrayed by everyone. I walked all the way to the front door and turned around because I just wasn't sure I could do it. You told me you were so hurt that you almost DIED and I wasn't even aware because I didn't keep in touch.

I was so angry that you were mad at me for trying to protect you that I couldn't even bring myself to answer your last email. For you to defend that piece of shit who was out at the bar while you were in the hospital damn near on life support was the most insulted I have ever felt. I wanted so bad to tell you everything, but I didn't want you to have anymore stress in your life.

You died a month later, and I've kicked myself in the ass ever since for not being there for you every single moment like I should have. I find myself reading your last email again and again. I can't delete it. It makes me cry uncontrollably every time I see it. 

You have to know I didn't send this to you because you were sick, and you didn't need any more stress. I didn't want you to have to deal with that shit while going through physical therapy. 

I miss you so much. One memory I think about a lot was the last time we smoked a joint together in your van after the kids fell asleep. We went to a diner at midnight after and got some pancakes. I felt proud to be your little sister.

You were so radiant, so beautiful. I hope you know that. I got a beautiful tattoo on my back that reminds me to carry some of your grace with me everyday. I love you.

There were so many red flags that I should've noticed early on - the declaration that we would be best friiieeeeendss within a few hours of meeting, the constant dismissal of everyone else in our hall as loud, vapid sluts not worth knowing before introductions were even made, the fact that you harshly judged others' character by the music they listened to...

You made it clear early on that you didn't give a shit about my well being.  The time my phone broke and I was waiting for a new one to come in the mail, and you wanted to go to a party on another campus and you promised me you wouldn't leave without me because I couldn't contact you?  And then you left me stranded at another school without a way to get ahold of anyone for a ride because you didn't want a third wheel between you and your crush?  

The frequent racist remarks you made towards me and tried to pass off as jokes.  The comments on my weight.  The constant stream of ""so-and-so is ugly/bitchy/annoying/slutty/stupid"" when you've never even spoken to so-and-so.  

This year, you moved in to our room first, and arranged furniture, etc. in a manner that severely hindered my use of the room.  Top bunk &lt;2 ft. away from the ceiling, my desk shunted into a corner away from windows and power outlets, my storage spaces in the path of the doorway (which needed to be kept clear).  I know I usually spend the night at my boyfriend's, but that doesn't mean I don't have the same right to be able to use the room we both pay for.  And you constantly resisted my attempts to sit down and compromise on a new arrangement.  

You told me you were planning a party for an exchange student you befriended.  I said it sounded like fun and asked for the time so my boyfriend and I could stop by, and you said no, you didn't want that, because we'd be bad influences.  We drink too much apparently, if you are of the opinion that 2-3 drinks a week is excessive.  

The breaking point was when I told you about my change of majors.  You knew I'd been struggling with depression on and off for years, that I hated my major, hated my classes, and was dreading another two years of the same.  Your response?  ""Wow, I wonder how your mom deals with having two lazy-ass kids.""  Fuck you.  Fuck you for dismissing my goals and preferences, and fuck you times infinity for bringing my brother into this (who you also haven't met).  

You're a terrible person.  You're incredibly irresponsible.  Your tuition bill the last two semesters has been paid by your boyfriend and the guy you friendzoned and still pathetically string along for the ego boost (but it's not *your* fault, you're responsible with money, it's *totally* all your mom).  The boyfriend who does all of your homework for you (otherwise you would have failed out by now, I don't think you've actually passed a test so far in your academic career).  The boyfriend you're probably cheating on (I can't think of any other reason you would make plans to room with ""J"" next year, especially after your boyfriend accused you of sleeping with ""J.""  Also can't think of another reason ""J"" would say your boyfriend is no good and give you an ultimatum to break up with him, which you actually gave serious thought).  

I feel sorry for your boyfriend, and I feel terrible for hoping this, but:  I hope he finds out you're fucking ""J"" and breaks up with you before he graduates next month.  Then where will you be?  No poor sucker to pay your tuition and do your homework for you anymore.  The only friends you have are either just as terrible as you, or are too afraid to say anything.

I try ignore this but I can’t help wanting to know how he’s doing.
We met a year ago at a friend’s party, we met up (with friends) a couple of times but that was that. I developed a crush, he didn’t notice.

We talked through Xbox live, and I finally had the courage to ask for his number. We texted multiple times and overall just laughed.
I told the friend who hosted the party about my crush. He said I should confess but I didn’t.

Half a year later I did, and he said he liked me back. A huge weight fell off my shoulders and I was so happy I couldn’t sleep that night. 
We went on a date the week after that. We were planning to go out for dinner and catch a movie. We hadn’t seen each other in half a year so it was very exciting. 

Our date kind of.. failed..
We were originally going to see the movie at town A, but the movie started later than the schedule said, so we had to go to town B. 
Since town B was further away for me, I didn’t have time to properly choose an outfit and do my make-up and hair. So I kind of looked like a slob.

After arriving It occurred to me that town B was a lame ghost town. The only thing to eat was pizza, but we didn’t have enough time for that. We had to be in time for the movie. 

So while we waited for the movie, we walked around the town. Me in front, talking like an idiot about stupid things. Holding on to a topic for too long, not knowing what else to talk about. He walking behind me, answering my questions and not being very excited.
We headed to the movie theater where we had to wait an additional 15 minutes. They seemed to last forever.. Not in an enjoyable way.

We were hungry, cold and just wanted to go inside.
When we could pay our tickets (which I ordered) he took out his wallet to pay, but I jumped in front of him like an idiot ‘No, I made the reservation’. He put his wallet back, looking defeated. My heart crushed at that point.
Well, he wanted to make up by buying some drinks and snacks, since we were starving. 

I looked like a fool by the way. Wearing my glasses, a –what my friend later called- granny coat, en my hair flopping next to my head. Plus the big 3D glasses on top of my own specs. He looked really cute though.

We sat there, I was too nervous to eat so I didn’t really see the movie because I was busy holding back my growling stomach. And he just sat there and let out a sigh from time to time. Awkward… though it already was.

So after the movie, we walked back to the station. He missed his train and I missed my bus so he waited with me at the bus stop. 
We chatted a bit and the mood actually seemed a bit more relaxed than before. 

I misunderstood him when he told me that he missed his train. I thought he missed the last train so I asked him to go back to my place so my parents could give him a ride.

He also misunderstood something.. (At this point I was really clueless, but no it didn’t involve sex) and the conversation turned awkward again.
Well, my bus arrived, and we ever so awkwardly said goodbye. Not a peck on the cheek, just a quick glance.

After I sat down in the bus I saw him walking to the station, like he just wasted a night in his life, and I had to hold in my tears.
I texted him, telling him that I was sorry for ruining his night, and he answered that I didn’t, and that he had fun. Nothing more, we didn’t speak much after that.
A few days with little to no talking later, I asked him how he really felt about me. 
He said he liked me, “but not “like” like, if you know what I mean’. Yea I knew, he just didn’t like me, simple as that.

So after that we have me, bawling my eyes out, and talking to my BF (the party thrower). He said that my crush was probably gay. Even his brother and near family/friends think he is.

So yea, I fell in love with a (probably) gay guy who doesn’t talk very much, is a bit of a weirdo but super hot, doesn’t like me while he says he does, and will probably never speak to me again.

I considered him a friend, then I wanted to see him as my boyfriend, now I don’t even know where we stand. I’ve invited him a couple of times to hang out with me and some buddies, but he always has something else to do.

If I ask him if I’m bothering him with my invitations, he says that I’m not. (But he probably doesn’t want to hurt my feelings again)
I still think about him a lot, even though I haven’t seen him in 3 months now. 

But I still want to, he was just a nice guy and fun to hang out with. Yes I had/have a crush on him but I just want to hang out for fun, not for flirting. If you know me personally you’ll see that I don’t even know how to flirt. I just want to see him.

I’m not hot, attractive, funny, or super interesting. And I’ve never even kissed let alone held a boys hand except for my fathers. And I’m already 19! I’m actually a really boring person, who doesn’t do anything special, or have interesting goals, or fun friends.
 
God DAMMIT, I just want to him to talk to me again.

I won't ever forget your beautiful, shy smile, your pretty hazel eyes, or the care and empathy you (used to) show when you saw someone hurting. I wont ever forget how I was able to let loose and be myself around you, however unintelligible and crazy as I could be. Our sense of humor was weird and when they'd get us in the same room together, it was just plain ridiculous. From the time we first met, it was as though we had known eachother for years. We'd finish eachother's thoughts, like we were (frighteningly) connected at the brain. 

When you found out it was you I was interested in, you were wonderful; you told me you're not into that, but that we'd still be best friends, regardless. I was cool with that. I respected you enough to be ok with things being the way they were; broken hearted, but grateful to still have you as my best friend.

But then that asshat took you away. He made you into someone that I didn't recognize anymore, someone who could be just plain mean and vicious and uncaring. I hate him for that, but I hate you even more for giving into it, when I know that's not the real you. You started playing mind games, being rude, blunt and hateful, just like him. Again, that's not the you I knew. 

I finally gave up trying to get you to understand that you're worth a million, bajillion times more than the way he treats you. He is an abusive asshole, plain as day. I hated watching your face change when we pulled up to your place, from happy sparkling eyes to sadness and stressed. I hate that fucker for the way he treats you. And I hate you for the way you treated me.

I tried to put you out of my mind, put our memories of the time we had together behind me, and I was finally able to. Now they're back and I'm sad and horribly hurt all over again. I don't miss the pain and hurtful words, but I do miss you.

I will always love you. You are simply, an amazing, funny, silly, beautiful person. Please don't ever, ever, ever, forget that. You deserve so much more in this world than to be treated the way he treats you.

My confidence sucks. Do you remember that one night in the park? I made you laugh (One of many times. Fuck, you look beautiful when your face lights up! We also have, like, an identical sense of humor!) and the moon reflected off of your eyes in a way that literally made my stomach flip. I momentarily thought about grabbing you by the hips and giving you a kiss. I'm pretty sure you wanted me to do that. But, part of me also assumed you would have just screamed and ran away. It's just that no one has ever made my palms sweat or made my mind race the way you do. I'm a 26 year old dude and you make me feel like I am 13.

I had my chance and I blew it. We spent a lot of time together and, at any moment, I could have said or done something and I didn't. Now I'm a million miles away, but coming back soon.

Time, it turns out, is the enemy of my mind. I wake up (and woke up) perfectly fine. Content in the knowledge that whatever we shared, it was spur of the moment, temporary. An exchange of desire (maybe even passion and lust though I may be optimistic), a beast of impulse. While the exchange means a lot to me, it is not something that I hold on to, hold against you, nor is it something I expect to become a part of our relationship (whatever it is, may be, or was). I appreciate the care you took. You were right to be concerned, and perhaps this letter is a small confirmation of that. After all, I am moved to write for *some* reason. As I've promised you several times now, I am your friend. That's what you need. It was not right of me to take advantage of your state of mind to get something I probably didn't deserve. I mean it when I say that I'm your friend. And I mean it when I say that I want to continue our friendship. But I know that I make it hard, almost impossible to do that. Because the truth is, I want what I want, and you know that you can't give me what I want. I know this too. So we can pretend to be friends. But the truth is, we can't. Because you're the one that will get away. It's complex, and unfair, and deeply selfish. But I want to have the cake and eat it too. And I'm just afraid that I won't be your friend. God knows I would be deeply resistant to being put in that box. It would constantly be a struggle for me. And as a result, a constant struggle for you. You would have no reason to trust me. And I don't blame you. I would be the ultimate *that guy* that would, in your mind, have ulterior motives. This whole episode seems to me to appear to your mind to confirm that. Ultimately, I wonder if I'm as genuine as I imagine I am, as nice as you think I am. Ultimately, I feel as if you deserve better from me than what happened.

But I also feel like it takes two to tango. And I feel as if, this is me being presumptuous, that you have underestimated your feelings for me. I may, in the end, not be too different from other guys in the sense that sex is on our minds, but I believe I am different in that I want to be with you for all of you. Your hopes, your dreams, your trials, and your failures. Just like I hope someone would be there for me. This is not to say you are, were or will be a bad person. And I hope you don’t read it like that. I just want to point out that it does take two to dance. And maybe you wanted to dance a little, and then stop. I'm right there with you. Ultimately, you are hard to read, because I feel as if you've come to this image of yourself as a future oriented person, but still stuck in your present. You want to live without being relied upon, but at the same time, you deeply crave that kind of intimacy and connection. In this way. I feel as if I've broken your moulds. Not too much, but enough that maybe you're lost in the cracks. I feel, in a way, we both want to have our cake and eat it too. Is it possible that maybe you've underestimated your feelings for me? I would like to hope so. Because that would really be what I would like. But on the other hand, I'm not sure if I am reading you correctly. Maybe I'm asking the question for selfish (and therefore, wrong) reasons. Regardless, I still fully understand your need for independence and self-discovery. I don't know what you want or need from me. And I know it sounds incredibly impossible, but whatever it is, I promise you I'll do my best to be that and only that. What we shared was great. memorable, and enjoyable, but ultimately, it is not a part of what I expect for us to be, and I hope that it's not something that has changed the way you see me. I guess what prompted this whole letter was how things have turned. I know the space is important in processing and understanding what happened. But I want to say that there was nothing there but the two of us needing something, and being in the wrong place at the wrong time together. It *doesn't* mean anything. And it shouldn't, because you mean more to me than whatever that was.  It's just like you said. It's not a big deal. And I really want to say that to you. I did, but I don't think you believe me. And I want to say it again, but I can't because I feel as if you also need the distance right now. Whether that distance is there for me, or for you, I'm not sure. I feel as if the risk of attachment isn't as one-sided as you made it out to be. That's okay, but it makes this letter to you that much more important, even if it’s just for me and will never be sent. Because your friendship is what matters. I know it's naive to pretend that it didn't happen, but I think it'd be a shame to let it change a great thing.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1j2ilo,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1j2ilo/its_complicated/,
1374691717.0,12,self.UnsentLetters,1iz1vq,Dear Human I Married: Be a father and a husband.,kindbutsad,18,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1iz1vq/dear_human_i_married_be_a_father_and_a_husband/,"I'm old and worn out. I'm 22.

I'm married with a kid who's 2 year olds. I love my kiddo to pieces.

Everything else....? I'm 50-50.

Husband, you refuse to help me care of baby boy. You've got a case of the ""women do women things"" attitude. You'll play with him for a few minutes, then shoo him away because you wants to play video games, surf the web, look at porn, whatever.

You work an 8 hour job. I get it. It's rough. But guess what? Other men work, too, and the decent ones have time to play with their kids and help their wives out with what little they request of them. My own brothers have wives, and they help them out caring for the kids! And they have more than 1!

I can't go shopping without a phone call asking when I'll be home or come home to baby son up WAY past his nap time. Change a diaper? OUT OF THE QUESTION. NO. NOT MY JOB. 
Oh, he cried the WHOLE time! Feed him? I fed him popsicles!!!
That doesn't really count....

It doesn't help that most of the interaction you with your son is yelling at him. Then you wonders why he runs away from you? Surprise, surprise. I guess that's the price you pay for being a hard-ass by yelling at a curious 2-year old boy. Underfoot? YELL AT HIM. Messes up your video game? YELL AT HIM. Won't stop handing you that book he wants you to read to him? YELL AT HIM.

Boy, that kid is a pest, right? Couldn't get any worse. What a brat.

I can't even take a bath alone without baby son coming in and wanting to join, but sometimes I just want some alone time. Will husband distract him with a book or a game while I soak? NO NO NO. Why not? I guess it's not his responsibility to look out for the happiness and well-being of his child.

The concept of “daddy” doesn't come from providing money and provisions; hell, we're on food stamps, so the government is paying for our food supply, not you! Not that that's bad, but, as I said, money and provisions don't make a father. Is baby boy going to look at the food and his room and say “Wow! Daddy is so great and loves me so much because look at how he provides for me!”
Lemme just say NO.
A dad is a man who loves, comforts, plays, teaches, shows the attributes in himself that he wants to instill in his child: patience, gentleness, kindness, self-control..... 
You are what you're becoming.

I don't do everything right, but I do my best to provide positivity, love, and support no matter what happens and what decisions are made. 
However, when does it go from being too kind to be enabling? If I call you out on something, suddenly it's all about what I do wrong. What crimes I've committed against him. What I don't do. Suddenly, that responsibility for your own actions turns to blame which is shifted onto me.

“WELL MAYBE IF YOU KEPT THE HOUSE CLEAN....!!!”

What? Then you'd start wanting to help me out? Then you'd start being a better father? Then you wouldn't be so angry all the time?

When you becomes the one who's wrong, you get hostile and turns it so that you're no longer the one who can be blamed for anything.
There's always a reason, an excuse, a “logical” explanation for the shitty things you do.

“It's my childhood!” “I was always blamed!” “I was the black sheep!” “It's EVERYONE else who makes me feel angry!” “I'm unstable!”

Find your excuse. Stick to it. If need be, if it's what it takes to keep you sane, get on pills. Go see a therapist. Go to a support group.

At this point, I don't give a shit.
Do something.
But stop treating me, the one who genuinely loves you and cares for you and only wants the best for you, like shit.
Like I'm unworthy, subhuman, the scapegoat, the REAL problem, the bother.
I've been treated like that ALL my life.
I know I'm not special, but I try to be kind and understanding.

You, however, continue to tread on that thin line of my breaking point.

I'm starting to not care that the things I do “annoy” you.
Typing, going out by myself, not cleaning, urging you to take responsibility for your things and your actions, my humble jobs that I know you don't approve of.

I GET IT. I SUCK.

But if you hate it so much, stop forcing yourself to hang around me.
But if you love me, WORK WITH ME.

Compromise, talk, listen, care, think, accept hard things.

I also feel pressured like I'm constantly in a tight spot to keep up with my own life, but I do my best not to let the negative feelings of what I'm unhappy with in my own life spill over onto you. I do my best to see how those things can be fixed, and I do my best to accommodate for a happier lifestyle.
BUT.
The thing I can't change is YOU.
And you, whether you mean to or not, are becoming a bigger and bigger mountain I need to climb, when life is a big enough mountain for me.
I didn't want you to become that. I wanted you to be the one I walk hand in hand with while we faced that stupid life-mountain together, boulders, difficult hikes, avalanches, and all! 

If you're unhappy, you need to look at your OWN life and stop looking and everyone elses' life around you. Find out what YOU can do better, instead of finding what everyone else can do better to make your life easier.

Okay?

This is not a slam or a call-out.
This is a firm reminder.
A reminder that I love you, but I can't fix you or make you happy all of the time, and you are being unreasonable for expecting me to.
A reminder that, yeah, life sucks, but it's life. Okay? Everyone has shit they gotta do keep living. Doesn't mean you can't enjoy it or you can shirk because you think “you've done enough for the day”.

Being a father and a husband isn't something that just stops because you're grumpy and tired and you've worked hard all day.

Okay?

Look.
Just think about your actions and your words. The affect us, your wife and son, good and bad, whether you mean it or not, your words in any mood can pack a wallop.

Think about what you want to do.
Okay?

I love you.

Stop making me doubt that I do.

It's been five months since you called me while I sat on my dorm bunk.  In two months, I learned just how terrifying the world of suicidal thoughts is.  I learned just what value you had to me, though I knew all along.  I learned that there was nothing I could do but watch as you walked away.

After all of those spent tears, all of the roses in desperation to get you to return to me, all I saw was that it was all your fault.  You've said it yourself to me, it's always been you.

I would like to start off with the fact that I love you and I am glad you made some changes and try to be in my life. I try to be understanding. I really do. I know that alcoholism is a serious disease and a very hard thing to go through... but you had kids, man. You needed to make those changes long, long ago.

That said, why the hell did you not get your life together early enough? You left me alone at 3 years old to take care of my infant brother while he was still on a heart monitor? So that you could go to the bar? Jesus! What is wrong with you?

All my early memories that involve you also involve yelling and then me trying to figure out what I did wrong, yet again. It hurts, Dad. It really hurts.

And I know that Mom cheated on you. I understand that you were angry. But you can't fucking stab people on the front lawn! And you can't try to kill yourself in our bathroom, less than 15 feet away from our open bedroom door. I was 6! Do you know how terrified I was? Do you have any idea what kind of mental damage you inflicted on me?

And I get that you were in jail, but you could have written to us more than one time that year. After that dreadful night -- the night that still haunts my dreams -- you practically disappeared from my life. You went from being my father who lived with me and sometimes was awake and happy enough to go to my events to someone I saw about once a month. You were like a fun uncle.

Except I never really felt like you came back into my life. Not really. Slowly, our visits faded from once a month to once every other month to once every couple of months. You stopped calling. You never wrote.

You didn't come to my middle school or high school graduation, but you came to BOTH for my brother. I always felt like you loved him more.

I was in the spelling bee, I was in the Faith-A-Thon, I did forensics, acting, choir, soccer, basketball, and volleyball. My team won the battle of the books 3 years in a row and I was the highest reader out of my whole school for 2 years. You didn't show up for anything. You never acknowledged me. I got a scholarship for high school. I had a 4.0 from 4th-12th grade. Why was that not good enough? Why didn't you love me?

Mom always told me that you did, and that it was just in a different way. I wanted to believe her but it was so hard.

Then I got into college. One of the best colleges in the state... and you still weren't proud of me. You still wouldn't contact me. I HATED you. Sometimes I worry that I still do.

Then, one year after Christmas, I decided that I wouldn't call you; that I would wait until you called. I wanted to see how long it would take. You didn't call me for 5 months -- and then you only did because Mom told you I was pregnant.

Like I said, I am glad that you are making an effort to be in my life. I am glad that you are making an effort to form a relationship with me. But do you know that you never said sorry to me? Ever? About any of the things that you put me through.

I think I was stupid, and still am; there's still a ray of hope in me that someone listened when I prayed.

I won't pray anymore. I won't plea. I won't cry to something in the heavens, hoping they would make my troubles go away. Also, I won't take shit form anybody anymore; there's no karma, no justice. It's a cruel world and I'm all alone.

Everything I went through, worked so hard for everything I have; blood and tears! hoping I'd be rewarded. My only constant reward is pain. From now on, I believe in no prayer. I will not stare at the ceiling and ask for whatever. I'm broken beyond repair; that's all I am, after being put through everything. ""I'm alone"", I'll keep saying it until I completely absorb it.

No prayer of mine was answered and I prayed for years for evil, rotten people to die and instead the good are ripped from their loved ones and die of cancer and war. Where's the justice in that?

If there's someone high above, he took my friend's father and destroyed a family while keeping my piece of shit father alive to torture me and my family. Justice? If it is, I can't see it and I don't think I'll ever be able to.

Feed me more rubbish, say it's a test; how many tests does one have to go through before even reaching the age of 25? Why don't the people who take everything for granted, don't believe in a god and have never prayed get to to have normal loving fathers and I get a sick, selfish, lame excuse of a human being? and it doesn't stop at that, you had to make his disease hereditary, so I can get it too. I know I have it, I don't need a test to tell me that. I loath him so much, I'm bound to end up like him; but again, no justice!! so we'll see.

I foolishly prayed for death, that didn't come either. What's new! I don't get to live like I want to, why should I die when I want to? Too much of a coward to do it myself, but maybe, just maybe, someday soon I'll give in to the sweet nothingness that is death.

Listen. I know I was oblivious. In hindsight, I missed so many signs that you wanted me as much as I wanted you. Or perhaps I was just scared that it might be too good to be true. I left your friends house party once and you asked for a kiss before I departed. And so I kissed your cheek softly. The disappointed look in your eyes hardly registered at the time. Oblivious, yes. 

You told me that the reason you were leaving Colorado for Orange County was to confirm your memories. To make sure that your childhood actually happened the way you remembered it. 

Did it? Does your memory serve you well? Mine does.

Finally I was able to get past the numbness and I lay on the floor sobbing. With perfect timing she woke up, or maybe I woke her up.  I then had to bring her down stairs and make her dinner while trying to do the no-sound-crying (the most painful way to cry) just allowing the tears to stream down my face.  Then I couldn't breathe, I was gasping for air and had my phone in my hand, wanted to call you and tell you to just talk to me for a minute while I tried to gain control again.  I have no way to contact you, I won't even see you again for 6 months, no talking, no texting, no email or facebook (you really went off the grid).  So I paced the room with my phone in my hand making choking noises while she ate Mac and Cheese.  I not only can't talk to you, I also have no one else to call and talk to.  I have never felt so alone and cut off from the rest of the world, actually I have but I haven't felt that way in 4 years.
  I lost my best and only friend.  I have no one to watch our daughter while I go through all of this and she keeps on asking me where you are and crying for you and it is so hard to keep my feelings separate from hers, I know that her pain will be so much worse than my own.  She spent every day of her 3 years with you, she has never been away from you longer than a week and she still thinks that you will come home any time.
Her pain makes my pain more painful and all I can think about is the pain, my body aches, my head hurts, my guts hurt, my chest hurts and I feel like I am going to vomit.  I just want an idea of how long this physical pain will last, I have never gone through a break up where I still cared about the other person at the end, usually I stay until it hurts more to be with them than without and I have never had to experience this pain before.  
Is it two weeks?  A month?  When am I going to feel okay again?  I know it isn't supposed to last forever but I can't even imagine how it will feel NOT missing you.  I remember reading that it takes half the time you were together to get over someone, so two years?  I don't think I can feel this way for that long.  I also read that it starts over each time you see or talk to that person but I have to see and talk to you all the time after you come back because of our daughter.  Does that mean I will never get over you?  I just hear about how important NC is and I can't have it.

 I miss you.  A lot. 

 I feel unresolved.  Maybe it would have been better if we decided never to talk again.  It would have hurt so much more than it did, but then maybe I could’ve gotten over it.  It would have been quick.  Quick but painful.  But right now it’s slow and painful.  I can’t fully transform my feelings from being completely in love with you to seeing you as you say you see me - as just friends - because I can’t see it coming from you.  Do you really see me as a friend?  It’s like pulling teeth trying to talk to you.  And you don’t answer texts or phone calls.  You ask how I am doing but then don't really listen or respond to the answer. Do you even care anymore? You did tell me I care more for you than you do for me.  My fears are validated.

I feel like our relationship - as a friendship, since that’s what it started as - is built upon deep conversations.  You know some of my deep dark thoughts and feelings that no one else really knows.  I can count on one hand the number of people that know those things about me.  That know the most at least.  Does that mean anything? I used to feel like I could tell you anything and you wouldn’t judge me.  Now I kind of feel like if I tell you, you won’t give it the time of day.  You’ll send some shallow, short response that’s not reassuring at all.  And maybe all I need is someone to listen - but I don’t even feel like you’ll do that for me.  

Maybe this is all my fault.  As I’ve said before when I’ve been hurt by friends, maybe I expect far too much from my friends.  I mean, that’s understandable.  I don’t need a lot of shallow friendships, so I have a few really close, deep friendships.  I thought that was what the other person wanted too, but maybe I was wrong.  Maybe I’m better off keeping everything inside, not trying to form deep friendships, and have lots of shallow friends and smile and go throughout my life like everything is perfectly fine. Have I changed? Is that why this relationship seems so different and difficult? 

I just wish I could reverse time.  I wish you had never kissed me.  Remind me why it is you did, if you felt nothing for me? It was absolutely wonderful and I was blissfully happy for a couple weeks but maybe if you hadn't there wouldn’t be this strangeness and you’d still talk to me and we’d still be normal friends. But see, I don’t know if there is strangeness.  Maybe this is all in my head.  I HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE YOU WON’T TALK TO ME. 

I'm afraid of being forgotten.  And left behind.  And I feel like you've both forgotten me and left me behind.

What am I to you?

You moved up to help your brother paint his house or something, far away from where I am now. It's weird, before you left when you said to me ""When I leave... IM NOT COMING BACK"" in the car to the local IGA, I didn't care. You were absent long before you left, you were full of negativity and probably depression but instead of doing anything you decided to let it out on us verbally. Making us feel like shit every time we came home from school.

Yet I still felt sorrow at the fact I didn't feel sorrow, if I had built my way to the position you were in I probably would have done the same thing. I could understand.. I just didn't care. The night you left, you walked up to my room in a haste, excited to get out of here. Gave me a weird side hug and said goodbye as I refused to move from my attention from the computer but as soon as you walked out my door, I regretted it, I followed you to your car saying bye and drive safe but never ""I love you"".

Anyway, once you left we never spoke like my brother and sisters did to you. I never sent an email, I never answered the phone. 6 months later, what was only 4 weeks ago, the phone rang and echoed in my house as I was home alone. I had to answer it, not knowing who was there on the other end, it was you.

""Hellooo.""
""Hi *my name*, what's going on?""
""Oh hey, not much. Everyone's out currently. What's happening there?""

I used the word there because I didn't know where you were, I didn't want to say 'up' there or 'down' there because I didn't care until you said:

""I'm watching the sun go down...""

What could have been seen as foreshadowing of the impending news was in fact a hand that you extended to me, wanting me to connect with you. Maybe you felt regret, maybe you were lonely, whatever reason you obviously wanted things to be better between us. My heart  was confused and undecided as those 6 words broke through the perpetuating layers of resentment I created to protect myself from you, from you leaving us. I stumbled, trying to prevent an awkward pause:

""I..uh got a minifridge in my room""

You responded with hearty laughter, a contrast to what your previous stance was and how passionate you were to dismiss the possibility of me getting one.

We talked not for long, about small things; changes in the house, who's birthdays are coming up, when I start my exams, before it came to a conclusion though you told me how you stopped smoking and had not been facing any withdrawal symptoms. I could not feel happier for you.
""Yeah, I went to the doctors with my x-ray and they said I had the lungs of a 116 year old man""

You continued:

""Apparently I probably will have Emphysema""

I didn't feel so happy anymore. It was a moment of clarity, I could compare it to all the pettish school-yard fighting and drama and was able to see the frailty of life. You obviously didn't want to talk about it , as you were alluding to the conclusion of our conversation with ""...well I'd better let you go now!"" but I didn't want to let you go or that small 2 minute bond we had, I wanted you to say that you loved me. I know you do, I'm not stupid and I know our relationship isn't as straight forward as that. You find showing affection to be awkward and out of your person but what if it was the last time I heard from you. You should have. You don't know how fucked up your body is from decades of aggressive smoking. You really should have.

---------------------------

Coincidentally an hour later, *Uncle's name* called (My mum's brother), he just wanted me to tell Mum to send some underwear and money down to him (In Gaol). We talked for an even shorter amount of time, yet he found the words to say ""I love you *My Name*"". He is literally imprisoned, whilst you were merely imprisoned by your misplaced sense of stoicism. 

Before I started writing this, I felt full of anger and disdain but I've been thinking back to when we were kids and you were there for us. You were fun, protecting, happy, you made me feel safe, don't get me wrong you'd keep us in line but you showed you did it because you cared, somewhere along the line. Maybe after the injury, you lost all that. As we grew older, we grew apart and you chose to abandon us altogether.

I love you, I wish I hugged you before you left and I hope you come back soon, at least for a while.

I miss you everyday. Sometimes there are days where I don't remember you, those days are good, because, they don't remind me how much it hurts, how much losing a friend hurts.

I still can't believe how we're not friends anymore, because of one stupid fucking argument. I believe that what I said, didn't really hurt. And you know me better than anyone else, you should've known that I'll probably get back to you after a day or so. But you decided to cut me off from your life.

I could've said something a lot more worse than what I said. Actually, I can't god damn remember what I said. All I know is, you were pissed because I hang up on our Skype call. 


I'm upset that you said we have nothing to talk about. We have tons to talk about. Maybe a year is a bit late, but I've been holding back whether to contact you or not, because I wasn't sure with how you feel towards me, were you still mad or not, and besides, our mutual friend told me you never want to talk to me again.

And he's right. I just wanted to try and fix this. I'm glad you're not mad at me. But why didn't you want to try again? Was our friendship *that* meaningless to you? 

Thank you for everything, from the late night skype calls, to us actually hanging out because you wanted to teach me how to play a game. Thanks.

Take care. I hope you're well and happy.

I have so many questions why, yet your not here to answer them. 

You never wanted a child with special needs, you got two a prefect one and a unhealthy deformed child. Dad didn't want you to name a child who was not going to live so you named my sister, dad named me. You and Dad had the choice to hold me until I die or surgery were I had a negative 10 percent chance of living. You picked the surgery and I lived. Why did you pick the surgery over holding me? Dad told me that you loved my sister more because she was beautiful and healthy is that true?

The earliest memory I have is laying on a brown couch thinking I was going to die. Where did this memory come from? Why do I remember it so well? Grandma told me that the memory was true her sister was in town she wanted to see me when they came to pick me up after calling they found you and dad in the back room getting high with my two sisters in the room with you. They found me on the couch barely breathing and rushed me to the hospital. Is this true?

Why did I have to have open heart surgery at the age of 3? You told me I fell down got a virus in my blood stream. Grandma told me that because you where too busy getting high to take me to the doctors when I got sick, after being so sick for months when she took me to the hospital when her sister was here to visit they found out that the virus in my blood was eating away at my heart. I contacted my old doctor, she told me she had called child services on you and dad so many times but they never took me away from you and what Grandma told me is true. I have to thank you, because you I got to go to heart camp.

Why when I was in the first grade through high school you would never wake me up, never make me breakfast, never pack my lunch, never help me with homework, never made sure I made it to the bus on time. Why did I have to do that on my own, why did I have to wake you up so you can wake up my sisters, get my sister backpack ready, get their school clothes ready, make them breakfast and take them to school? Pick them up from school make them a snack, help them with there homework, why by the time I got home, I had to do the dishes while you started dinner, why after dinner I sat doing my homework alone while my sister played outside?"" I do not think I will ever get this answer, but now I live with my SO. I interdependent, I have a job, I have friends. My sister is almost a year clean for drug addiction, she lives in a sober living house, my little sister is in prison and has been for the last 7 years, dad is now homeless.  

Why did it take you two weeks after I told you my ankle hurt to take me to the ER? Why did you cancel my bus when I fractured my ankle, only to forget about picking me up? Why when I normally get home at 3 pm didn't you look for me when I was not home at 6 pm. Why didn't anyone notice I never came home from school? I asked you about this a week later, you told me that since I didn't go to the office that you decided I will get home when I do, if I missed dinner it is my fault. You have a special need child mom I didn't understand this, I didn't know what to do.

Why when I made my first friend did you tell me I shouldn't make friends with someone who is retard. She was not retard, she had brain cancer. She and I had all the same classes does that make me retard too? You told me if I had normal friends then I will be normal. 

Why did you tell me that bullies would always bully me that even if you did something they would never stop, why did you tell me just to deal with it?
I guess this helped me more then hurt me, I dealt with bullies all my life and I still do to this day.

Why did you tell my teacher in front whole class that I wanted to kill myself my freshmen year. God I hated you for doing this. Thankfully I made friends with ""normally"" people yet you helped me make friends with the special ed students who felt the same way I did. 

Why did you always always take my sisters to school and pick them up from school yet you made me walk 2 miles to school and back home while you pass me when you took all of my sisters friends home. You made me feel hated, unwanted, not good enough. I will never know the answer to this, but I will make sure I never do this to any of my children.

Why did you pick drugs over me? Why did you have to die? Why do I love you and hate you? It has been almost 10 years since you died, you taught me so much how not to treat my children, yet I still have good memories of you, I still miss you like hell, I wish you were here. I wish you could see me who I am today. I cannot wait to have children when I do I will make sure they feel nothing but love from me, I will never single them out, I will never let them feel the ways you made me feel. I love and hate you at the same time.

I'm not going to lie, and say I've never felt like this before, but it *has* been a long time... and, after years of being the only person I knew who enjoyed any of the hobbies and interests that I find enjoyable, finding a beautiful, popular young woman who shares *all of them*, and is... compatible, with my personal preferences by way of romance... who believes a lot of the same things I do, but with whom there are enough differences to keep things interesting and *alive*... yeah. 

I never expected this.

This is the most hamfisted thing I've ever written, and I'm totally at a loss. As a kid, I would've been heartbroken over this. Got to admit that, when I'm low over something else, I feel something along those lines. That said... you are the high point of my life, and your friendship means more to me than money, or security, or lungs.

Our lives are just too...different? emeshed in others?

Maybe we loved in a past life (perhaps will love in the next?). I know you feel it too, this connection. The chemistry is hard to fight, we practically think in tandem; feeding off eachother for inspiration. Its a little dangerous to our current relationships for us to be alone. I know we've never spoken about this aspect of our 'friendship'...the part thats a little less than innocent... but not truly sinful either. I know we've never been unfaithful to the people we've dated over the years, or even intimate...we never had our chance. I didnt realize it at the time, but I have dated everyone but you...men with the same name (even your brother)...but never you. 
Now we fit together better than ever...and are so unhappy in our everyday lives, although I think that you're just frustrated for the moment. I know you love her, and are happy with her in the life you have built. I'm just glad to be in your life, and that you want to be in mine.

Dude.  Since I was about 13, I've been waiting to hear those words from you.  I've loved you since we were kids.  First I thought it was a stupid crush, but it never went away.  When it was clear to me that we weren't meant to be together as a couple (right about when I got back from Guam, and you were already with J, my final hopes dried up.  But, while I was overseas for two years, thinking of you kept me sane.) I decided to try to be the very best friend I could be, to you, just so we were in each other's lives. I didn't care how we spent time together, as long as we did. Here we are 23 years later, and there we are.  

I love you too.  I always have.  I wanted to say it to you last night, right back, but I somehow couldn't.  Then I couldn't find a good time after that, and as we got steadily drunker, I gave up. I didn't want the words to fall out of my mouth in a drunken tumble, easy to take back.  

It's been stuck in my throat for decades, I guess.  I don't love you like a brother, either.  I've said that out loud before, but no, that's a lie and we both know it.  I don't know what we are, except that I want us to be around each other in some way forever.  After our 10 year bitter hiatus, when we got back together without missing a beat, I know we're meant to be something.  I love you. I always have.

Till last night, I felt foolish and lovesick, whenever I thought about it.  I'm 35 fucking years old. I'm a grown woman, still cultivating a ""crush"".   Look at our lives! Then you said that, and I don't know, I feel way less foolish about things.  You've shown me in a thousand ways, nonverbally.  But to hear it?  To actually hear it.

This will be the first time letting anyone know. I saw a picture of you and my legs started trembling and my hands were shaking and I felt light inside my head, like I could fall over any time even though I had lunch right before that. I knew I had to tell someone. For some of months now or maybe even years I have been thinking that I might be in love with you. 

I don't like it.

We are very close friends and if even if we were to get together I am not sure we would enjoy doing so. I love you, I don't want things to change. It scares me. It is just that cliche. Heck, I don't even trust myself enough to know whether or not these feelings are genuine. 

You have had a boyfriend for such a long time, have broken up with him half a year ago and do not seem to get over him. I want to help you but I don't think I can anymore than I already do. You are the one to help yourself and seeing you struggle with your own emotions breaks me sometimes. I know you know that I am here for you.

My favorite movie is Lost in Translation. You hate it for some reason and I am sure we have debated it a bit where I waved whatever you were saying away. We went to concerts together and celebrated parties and birthdays together, I know what kind of music you like and you know what books I prefer to read. I sometimes think we have a relationship in all but name. Even though you are not attracted to me, and there are more beautiful women out there.

I have to come to terms with myself that however sad it may be, you will never love me the way I want you to love me. I will never tell you how I feel because I fear the consequences. If this were a movie I would know what to do, but this is not a movie. Real life seems to be like that.

I may be forced to tell you how I feel some time. Because I cannot bear to be with anyone at all right now and thoughts about you cloud my judgement towards other women. To me you are perfect, with all your flaws and imperfections. Perfection is a way of perception I tell people who deny the existence of anything perfect.

Yours sincerely.

i’m pretty disappointed in you

_three boyfriends at once??_

plus anyone else who you fancy for a few weeks

you obviously have learned nothing

you’re just as self-centered as always

still don’t think to consider how other people feel

it’s pretty disgusting, to be honest

like seriously

i don’t understand how you could be so sad about what happened with you and me

and always mention how if you could go back and change things, you would

and then continue to act and do exactly the same things to others

do you not learn?

i know you’re not stupid

i think you just don’t care

i really can’t respect you

because seriously

have you _ever_ had a relationship where you didn’t cheat?

and while i really don’t care anymore

because i am so far beyond letting anything you do affect me

it does make me like you even less

just the fact that you keep doing the same thing over and over again

i mean, everything you do makes you seem really immature

and whatever

you do what you want

i really can’t sympathize with complaining about your ""friends"" revealing something you wanted to be secret

well, i sort of can

because it means you have shitty friends

and i think it’s pretty much accepted everywhere that you shouldn’t do that to people

except apparently in the people you like to be around

i can’t say i’m very surprised

there’s a reason you and i have very different sets of friends

i can’t stand most of the people you choose to associate with

and i assume you feel the same about mine

so yeah.

if you didn’t want people to do that

maybe you should have considered the fact that they were a shitty person before

but then again

you never were a very good judge of character

or maybe you are

and the things that you like are things that i hate.

.

but hey

whatever

as long as you’re happy

i wish you’d quit doing shitty things to people

and quit being so obnoxious and immature

…i heard from so many people about your little “conversation” the other day with those company reps, with you telling them how awful their product was.

about how much they wanted you to shut up.

just stuff like that

i guess i can thank you for some things

like making me realize how much i dislike you

for how i can be okay on my own

something that a lot of people i know seem to have trouble with

and i don’t understand why

being dependent on someone seems like a really terrible way to live

I am writing to you from work because you are all that I can think about but I honestly don’t know where to start. The last month has been a complete whirlwind for me. After my break up and your divorce, we seemed to have found each other in the right place at the right time. We have been friends for years now and, honestly, I never imagined we would be here. I never thought you and your wife would get divorced. I never thought my relationship would end either. But we are both good people and we both deserve to be happy. And you make me happy. VERY happy. You told me that you were falling in love with me and I agreed that it was a mutual feeling. We’ve been talking every day, multiple times a day for the last month. Considering the circumstances of your living situation and mine, we obviously need to take things slowly as to not cause confrontation with our previous partners. Cool, I get that. But when we are all out at the bar and you leave with her because she is your ride, I feel like my chest is going to implode. I know you sleep in separate rooms. I know she already has someone else. I know nothing would ever happen. And I want to believe you when you tell me you don’t want her around. That I am the first thing on your mind when you wake and the last before you fall asleep. I want to believe you so badly, but it is so hard for me to watch you both come and go places together. I am not in any position to tell you that I don’t like it. I am not in the position to be upset. So instead, I bottle up my fears and my jealousy and I hide them away in the catacombs of my heart. Maybe someday I will tell you. Until that day, I will remain silent and strong. Things will take a while and I am prepared for that. You are worth the wait.

It was kind of arrogant, kind of condescending, kind of controlling for me decide for both of us that we should cut all ties and contact.  I didn't really want to, but I felt I needed to do *something.*  Even basic communication was failing, because we apparently couldn't ever be calm and rational at the same time.

I wanted what was best for you, and between my opinion of myself and the only clear statements you *ever* made were that you were confused, or that talking with me was self destructive.  As such, because I cannot bear doing harm to you, and I needed to protect myself as well, I decided for us. I still fear that if I had not, you wouldn't have for far too long to be healthy for either of us.  Hurting you that way seemed like it would be harmful than sticking around and occasionally lashing out, less harmful to me than being told I'm horrible when I'm being rational.

I cut off contact out of my love for you, and I'm sorry for all the hurt that may have caused.

Incidentally, when I asked why I should bother talking to you?  That was not a rhetorical question. I honestly wanted an answer, even it was just you saying that I shouldn't.  I was genuinely hoping for an actual reason, though.  Oh well.  My own fault for the tone.

I do apologize for making the decision I did.  If I had it to do over again, I think I would have done the same thing, honestly, though I wouldn't have done it so harshly; for all that I love you and want to do right by you, I had finally learned to put myself first.

Here we are again; the same spot we always find ourselves in. Not talking, not communicating. It is as if we are barely friends.

I'll confront you about it, again, ask you; ""Why are we not talking?"" Again, you will tell me that I didn't speak to you either, again I will point out that I am not the only one capable of starting a conversation. You will agree with me, again, and we'll agree to change and move on. Again.

And it'll last a week, maybe two. Every time we go through this circus, every time we act out this scene of our lives, I tell myself that ""This time, it'll be different. Maybe this time, it will last."" We'll have a short conversation every day;

""How're you?""

""Good thanks! How're you?""

""Fine thanks!""

And that will be pretty much the extent of it.

But I'll look back, every time you contact me, at the way we used to be. How much we used to talk; how well we used to get on and inside my heart will break just that little bit more than I thought it could, because we are like strangers to each other.

Because it won't last. It never does. We'll go back to how we were, then a few months down the line, we'll re-enact this scene like a broken record. Every time time it hurts a little bit more than the last, because it's like losing you all over again - even though I know I never really had you.

I'll make excuses for you, again, like I always do. Whenever my closest and dearest friends see that look cross my face, they'll ask me what's wrong. I don't even need to explain what's the matter, now I just say your name and they ask if it's the usual, which it usually is. That I miss you, that I can't reach out or connect with you, that I've lost you yet again.

They tell me to be the bigger person; to let you come to me. I'll try, I'll try to leave you to your own devices, but whenever I think of you I am always reminded that I'm not really a part of your life and I want to be so badly. But I'll try. I try so hard to be the bigger person, but I come out feeling the ant.

Because even after everything we've done, I still love you; I love you dearly, but I am not *in* love with you. I still care so fucking much about you but it feels like I'm giving my heart to a brick. Maybe it's because you find it hard to trust me, maybe it's because it's just not part of who you are, I don't know.

Sometimes I wonder if you are sitting at the other end of this, metaphorically writing your own version of my story. I know that I've hurt you, you know you've hurt me. We have both been the victim and the perpetrator  in this. I think we are both equally ashamed, but we seem to be stuck in this rut, it seems neither of us can pull ourselves or the other out. Do you want out? Or is that just me...

You said I could have any man I wanted, but I never got you. With you I simply cannot win. I have never won, and I never will do either.

And tonight I will keep an eye on my phone, ready to re-enact our scene all over again. More hurt, more worry. I wish if you didn't want anything to do with me, that you would just say, rather than wretching me through this all over again.

I don't think you understand that in the 2 1/2 years we were together you were my life. I never got close to anyone at my school because I wanted to make sure we got our time together. When talking to friends, they never fully had my attention because I was texting you. On the weekends, all my time went to you. It was my only chance to see you and I saw my school friends every day. I was so in love with you and I sacrificed making my own friends to be with you and our mutual friends. But when we broke up you somehow got them all to yourself and the girl I though was my best friend. You left me with no one who would be there for me. Sure, I had friends to hang out with. But none who knew me well and would be there for me in a second like I would for them. You took that from me. I've gotten closer to people this year, but nowhere near as close as I was to our group of friends. I don't know why I am so upset at losing them though. They obviously didn't care about our friendship as much as I did if they actually listened when you told them not to talk to me. 

I don't hate you. I pity you. I feel bad for you because if you keep treating your friends like you own them, you will NEVER know true friendship. You may think they are there for you, but I know now that I'm out of that group that you all talk shit about each other when the others aren't listening.

I don't want to marry you because married people aren't suppose to lie and cheat on each other.

You're not suppose to live your life knowing that your spouse wants other people more than they want you, values the thrill of newness more than they respect you, values the attention of others more than your feelings.

You don't make money fast enough to trade it for my love. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the nice dinners and the endless drinks you pump into me. That time you spend with me, when I am the sole object of your attention, I think those are the only hours I am truly happy. But when you go to bed at night I'll lay there and wish I didn't exist. I'll cry into the dog's fur. I'll stop breathing... stop, pause, hold my body still so the tremors and the wailing don't betray me. And you, clueless, sleeping with your back turned to me. It's the only way I know how to sleep anymore.

I wish I didn't have to be with you. I wish I had never taken you back all those years ago, the first time it happened. I wish I hadn't wasted my youth on you. But most of all: I wish I could survive without you. I wish anyone, anyone would come by and save me. I would leave you in a heartbeat if someone else came along and wanted me.

So how can I marry you, knowing that we are living on borrowed time? Knowing that I'm only stuck here because this is my only option... this or homelessness or death.

You probably won't remember our initial encounter, I'm not even sure you noticed me that day. I was walking home from school feeling thoroughly stressed when you suddenly passed me on that old bike, with the most genuine smile I've ever seen. In an instant you were gone - and all the stress and the worries were too.

I never expected to see you again - fast forward some months and we meet at a mutual friend's party. That evening I got to know you a little, it turned out that we'd soon be working together. 

Two weeks on the job and some family troubles leave me pretty devastated in the morning. I'm trying my best not to let anything show, still you notice, sit me down, and offer to listen. And without really knowing you that well I sense that I can trust you.

The weeks go by and the job leaves me almost no time for any leisure activities. Coupled with all the sly talk at the workplace and my notoriously bad organizing skills I'm slowly becoming more and more miserable. After one particularly nasty day I'm completely overwhelmed, again you notice. I decide to tell you about all the troubling things, the constant fears, the thoughts of failing. Stuff I usually only talk through with my 2 best friends, both of which I've known for 6+ years.
You're listening intently, gently urge me to keep my nervously fleeting eyes locked on yours. And then, while talking, I break. Eyes closed, I'm ashamed of the tears streaming down my cheeks. Suddenly you're *there*, warm hands on my back, holding me until I'm calm again. When I open my eyes again you're still wearing that soft smile you never dropped during our conversation.

That day you stayed an hour overtime just to listen to some angsty teen. Sure, sometimes you're quite snarky and many of the people here love talking about you behind your back but I honestly think you're great. 

Thanks for being the first one to tell me that I acted confident, thanks so much for listening and picking me up over and over again.

You helped me through so much, and i can never thank you enough for that. I guess i never will now... I promised you i'll always love you. And i will. Until the day that i die.

You're smart. You're a good leader. You're a good husband and father. You live your faith. You're all-around ace and I'm glad you raised me.

But now that I'm growing up and expressing opinions that you don't always agree with, you keep holding tighter and tighter and trying to mold me into a person I never was and never will be. I'm not as devout as you are and don't plan to keep up the facade once I'm on my own. I don't believe in the patriarchy. Sometimes I swear. I would like to drink alcohol on occasion. I'm gay, and the day you find out you'll ask me ""why didn't you tell us?"" The only person you should be asking is yourself. I know you don't want to lose me. I don't want to lose you either. But for my own sake I will cut you off if you can't bring yourself to let me be my own person.

Every time I see an email or Facebook message or text or voicemail from you I want to delete it without seeing what you have to say. You're always telling me how I should change and squash myself into a box and keep my opinions to myself, but it's always cloaked in ""I'm worried about you and I love you"" so I won't think you're just being critical. But every time you say stuff like this I just want to get further and further away from you. I know you'll always love me, but I'm scared to death that you don't *like* me. That in order to gain your approval and to have a good relationship with you I'll have to change some very fundamental things about myself. I shouldn't have to do that. You shouldn't ask for it.

See, I don't think you realize how good you have it. It would be different if I was bringing drugs into the house or stealing from people or even just being a little asshole like people my age can so often be. I'm a good person. I have one speeding ticket under my belt, which I took care of on my own. I help out around the house. I'm doing good in school and taking out loans so one day I'll be able to say that I put myself through college. All I want is to be different from you, or at least the parts of you that I don't want to be. You are lucky you have a daughter whose disagreements are ideological and not over some creepy older boyfriend with a neck tattoo.

You would have made a great feudal overlord. You bought animals and a farm not because we have some continuing heritage of farming but because you like to be in charge and to look out triumphantly over your dominion. You have to be in charge of your wife and your children and if they disagree with you on anything you mansplain and condescend them into agreeing with you. I see what this has done to my mom after twenty-three years of marriage, and although I know you love her, I don't think I can forgive what you've done to her, maybe without even realizing it. I'm not going to be a part of that. I'm going to get out before I'm on a cocktail of medications, before I start rationalizing my ""choice"" to let my identity be subsumed by yours.

The sad thing is that we have so much in common. We're both INTJ, whatever that actually means. We look kind of the same. We both like Star Trek. We both have little patience for the silliness and shallowness of others. We don't have to be so different. I want to have a relationship. Ball's in your court, Dad.

We need to stick to a planned and written schedule and changes to it need to be communicated between us in writing and the kids need to be told verbally what's going on. 

I am not going to continue our text message conversation, so I'll document it here in email and be done with it. 

You sent me a text today at 4:34 (10 minutes from when you are supposed to pick them up):

""Hello, just a reminder I will b home at 8:35 pm thanks""

I go back looking or any record of such a statement and of course there is none because you never said anything about such a thing.

I reply at 5:36

""Thats not a reminder ..a reminder means you told me before""

at 5:48 you reply

""Well, since I did the same thing last Tuesday, I thought I would remind u that I'm doing the same thing again tonight.  My class ends at 8:30""

See, this is why a written schedule is good.  One it removes the assumptions and two it eliminates the errors.  You did not do this last Tuesday, I have it documented and if you remember last week the kids had music lessons on Monday that i took them to after picking them up from school, our son had DI after school on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.  You picked him up from school on Tuesday at 5:30 and came to get our daughter from my house.   I remember the conversation with her that we were spending less time together because of the music lesson day change.  Your incorrect here, you do not remember what happened last Tuesday.  Today you simply flaked and did a no show is what happened. 

When I took the kids home at 8, I stayed until 8:20 when I texted you:

""the kids are home alone""

To which you had a catty reply:

""yep just like they were home alone yesterday all day"".

That was the end of the text conversation for me.  It looks like you want to argue over text and I am not interested in that. 

I do not really understand how you can honestly compare the two things.  I had to work on Monday, and I had to go in for a major meeting.  I texted you the night before and made sure you knew.  I did get to the house as soon as I could, but by then most of the day was over. 

You compare the kids being home then because I was working, (during a workday, the horror), in order to support them and you and cannot possibly reschedule the meeting because it is a global priority 1 issue.  You compare that to you flaking on the schedule and going to the gym...  and somehow end up mad at me as being an asshole. 

In the past during our marriage I would have fallen for this.  I love that about you, how you twist things around and make me the bad guy.  In the past I not only would have carried your guilt gladly, I would have felt shamed for it.  I would have apologized, I would have felt like a jerk for upsetting you.  I would have beat myself up mercilessly while drinking myself through the depression i was facing during that time.  And you would have the smug satisfaction of having me to blame for it. 

Then imagine my surprise when my son calls me at 9:15pm, crying.  I ask him what's going on, he says he misses me.  I calm him down, tell him it's ok and that I love him.  He calms down and is laughing after a few minutes feeling better.  He hands the phone to you and I can immediately hear the poison in your words.  You came home and had no one to give your guilt to so you gave it to the children.  When our seven year old started crying you had him call me.  When I cheered him up you launched into some other angle to try to manipulate me into your game and take responsibility for something I have no responsibility for.  When that didn't work you had to go. 

So again, let's just stick to the written schedule for care of our children until the divorce is final and then we can follow the court order.  ",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_18v4ow,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/18v4ow/dear_stbex/,

First off, there's something special about this. Despite the fact that this is technically ""unsent,"" you will see it. I have zero doubt in my mind that you will.

In the short time that I've known you, you've turned on lights I never knew were off, awoken me to my terrible failures, and - in a roundabout way - made me see the good in myself. You've made me feel more of ""a man"" than I have ever felt, yet brought me down to Earth in a way I didn't expect. 

In spite of how better a person you've made me in this short three month period, I have many regrets. Most of those you know plainly well, but there is one more I'd like to tell you: 

I wish we met each other earlier.

It isn't that unlikely. I could have sought work here instead of school, gone to undergrad here, or even have grown up in the same city as you had my folks decided not to move when I was young. Had the wheel of fortune turned ever so slightly, we would've met much sooner, and likely have been together at a more opportune point. 

I, in my formative teen years, suffered a pretty horrible trauma that I still haven't gotten over, and I am reminded of constantly. The greedy side of my heart wanted to tell you about it so I could get the physical and emotional comfort I had sought for so long, but the sensible, mature side said that now isn't the time. I'll tell you when I'm ready.

Had I met you earlier, this may never have happened. You, the shining example of my older years, would have given me the confidence and courage to avoid the circumstances leading up to what happened. I could've said ""no"" much more forcefully, and escaped something that helped twist me.

You, in your formative teen years, were abused and hurt by adult men in your lives. One touched you; the other came back just to tell you how hopes and dreams mattered less for girls than good looks. You blossomed into a magnificently gorgeous woman in your own right, but not because of them; rather, it was in _spite_ of them. 

I am a dreamer, and when you told me these things, they horrified me. Selfishly, it horrified me when you once compared me to your father, but all else equal, the fact that your father stomped over your dreams to do the good and justice you crave for infuriates me. Had we met earlier, I could've encouraged you to keep following your dreams, and offer myself as a better example to cling to than those people.

I truly, truly wish we met each other earlier.


But I can't ask to have a life I didn't have. I can only hope to live this life as righteously and happily as I can. 

For my own horrific failures, we are breaking up. Anyone who looks back at my comment history will get a nice snapshot of all my emotional ups and downs over something that is unequivocally _my_ fault; mea culpa. I wish we met earlier so that I couldn't have failed you, but such is life: I will take this one magnificent mistake, remember it always, and push forward.

But even in all your anger and disappointment, you love me enough to offer one strand of hope for a happy future together, years down the line when I'm a better man. Day will rise.

I still wish that we met each other earlier, even after typing all this - that would have been our perfect world with no divide. But the future is a wondrous thing.

To you, J, I have a deep and profound appreciation. It will come again, I swear.

But then after spending a long time writing it, the real me got back into control of myself and I realised all that hate came from one of you. I know who I am, the real me almost never gets angry. I am very understanding and empathetic, so stop trying to making me believe I’m a bitch.




**To the Parasites,**


**You all came to make little nests in my brain at different points in my life. GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) I believe you were first.** Of course, I was too little to know what you really were. My earliest memories were of night terrors, I know now that you were the cause of that. I have countless memories of you sitting me down and us having a wordless discussion about death. We would sit together and try to imagine what it would be like not to exist. I wasn’t as afraid of death back then, because all my closest relatives were very religious. I didn’t want to die or anything, I just felt I knew I’d be okay even if it did happen.


 A few years later, still a child, you started whispering things in my ear. You made me so aware of everything, of other people, and my own body. You had no more knowledge of the world than I, and I being so very little, didn’t really know much of anything except that I loved chocolate and really had a thing for stickers. So when you asked me questions, it triggered something in me which lasts to this day. You stop me from doing such a basic human function that most people don’t even think about it when they’re doing it. You gave me a fear of choking, and of others choking. To such an extent that it would stop me from eating. You made me think I was a brat, you made my parents think I was just being difficult, and frustrated them to no end. But in reality, you were there with your hand around my throat every time I took a bite of food. And I had no way to explain what was happening to me, as I didn’t understand it myself. You still do it to this day. But screw you, I’ll eat anyway. If I choke, so what? Someone will help me.


You fill me with “What if?”s, you make my heart race, you kept me up most nights during my schooling. I thought I was just weird, hearing noises in the night which most would know were nothing. But you perceived them as life threatening, you’d make my heart pound, choke me, make my whole body shake violently with fear. By the time I was in grade 11 and 12, I would only ever sleep once a week at home. My brain had to make up for it by having naps in class, every class, no matter how hard I tried to stay awake. You really messed up my grade you know. You do a lot of terrible things to me, I just want to be normal.




**I think the next of you to mention is OCD.** You’re barely around, and I like that. You only really come out when GAD is being extremely stupid. When I’m in a panic at night, you make me check all the locks  over and over for the entire night. It’s like you have short term memory loss. I check them, we find they’re all locked. Then you forget I just did it and make me do it again until the sun comes up. But we haven’t done that in a while, and I’m proud of that. Good job.



When GAD is being annoying during the day, we get obsessed with symmetry and neatness. We count our steps on the ground, making sure they’re even amounts on both feet. Or play counting games with our steps (which I have no choice but to partake it. When we feel this way, and we see our room is a mess, it stresses you out so much. You give me a burst of energy and I do nothing but clean and straighten until it’s perfection. But then again, this doesn't happen that often these days. And I know you only do that stuff in your own weird way of wanting to relieve the stress, I get that. 



You do think about weird things though, which I could do without. For example, earlier today I spilled pins on the table. Now you won’t stop showing me the image of me sticking all of them into my arms, making me feel curious as to what it feels like, we won’t be doing that though. A lot of harmful thoughts like that. Though some aren’t as harmful and just a little weird. You are extremely curious, and make me want to smell and taste everything. I don’t let you taste anything that could be fatal though. We’re actually doing pretty well. But a little of the credit for that goes to Ms Depression over there, who makes me not care about that stuff.


**Depression, it’s hard to say when you started building your little house up there in my brain,** but you joined in the party in grade 8, my first year of highschool. You kind of just sat in the corner for a while not saying much, but you were still there. Sometimes I didn’t really feel anything, or just felt sad for no reason, but I brushed it off. I figured most teenagers have this kind of thing. Didn’t really have any friends which may have been why you showed up then. But you started to head for the exit when I met someone in the last half of the year. A friend of my brother. We all liked him a lot, he was my best friend, and eventually became more. Though the next year he had to move to a new school. Luckily we both didn’t have much of an interest of being in school, so we’d meet up. I didn’t really see much of you Depression around that time. But due to a few circumstances, I had to break up with him. It wasn’t my choice, I still cared greatly for him. I don’t know if I was old enough to love, but I thought it was. I couldn’t explain the truth, so I said nothing, giving no reason. Just breaking off contact. I regret that. I considered myself ‘his’ for years after that.



Depression decided to creep slowly back in, slowly dig it’s roots deeper into my brain. By the time I realised it was there, it was too late. When I was about 15 or 16 I thought I was going crazy. Depression kept getting into the front seat, driving my brain and my body. It hid my happiness from me all the time, I could rarely ever find it. Around this time I stopped believing in god. I still sometimes wish I believed, and I think so much about that sort of stuff, but I just can’t convince myself. I suppose it’s GAD that wants to believe it, because it’s so afraid of dying and not existing anymore. It got so down that it would hurt me, whenever I got the opportunity. I would hide in the bathroom at work, school and home, and cut the heck out of my body. Sometimes depression didn’t do it. Sometimes it was me, out of pure frustration and confusion, that would cut. 



When I was 18, in the last year of my school, you controlled me a lot of the. You stopped me from eating, from sleeping. You wouldn’t let me concentrate on studying. You kept telling me you wanted to kill me and end it all. I still don’t know how I didn’t do it. GAD actually helped. There were times when I was in such despair, thinking about offing myself, that GAD would pop up and tell me how afraid of death it is. Sometimes Depression didn’t give a shit, and yelled louder. The main reason I suppose was the real me, my empathy, not letting myself do it because I knew how badly it would hurt my family. Thank goodness I ignored Depression, the bitch. A few years later, Depression is still around, but now it doesn’t always control me, and I rarely ever hurt myself. Sometimes it’s like weights chained to my body, not letting me get up and do anything. But sometimes I get up anyway. Sometimes I use it, I manipulate it. I take advantage of it and try to channel it into sometimes creative/constructive. Sometimes I get diddly squat, sometimes I get something that’s sort of decent. We’re doing okay right now, but it tends to get bad when the worst of the bunch comes out. Maybe I’ll save it til last, as I’m not even sure myself what it is exactly.




**Next up are GAD’s siblings. SAD (Social Anxiety Disorder), HA (Health Anxiety), and PD (Panic disorder).** I don’t have much to say to these ones. SAD, you make me panic when I try to play an instrument infront of people. You made me fail music class. I knew the songs forwards, backwards and inside out. But you rendered my fingers speechless. You also make things difficult for me to do anything social. You make me spend a lot of time hidden away. You suck. But we’ll get through it, one day it’ll be okay.



HA, thank you for worrying about me, but it’s a little excessive. Back off. Not everything is cancer or some horrible life threatening disease. A papercut will NOT kill you. And no, I REFUSE to google every little thing that pops into your thoughts. Keep it to yourself please, it’s stressing me out. 



PD, boy you ‘re a pain. You’ve given me a lot of panic throughout my life, mostly at night. When you come out, SAD goes away completely, you made me ask a stranger to borrow their phone. The worst panic attack you gave me was at my relatively new job. I hadn’t had a panic attack like that before. I had experienced all the other symptoms before, except the going numb part. My arms, legs, stomach went tingly and I lost feeling in them, and my fingers and toes cramped up so bad, that I thought I was being possessed by something. I had never been more convinced I was going to die. I also screamed. The first time in my whole life I’ve ever screamed infront of anyone. Because of you, my co-workers probably thought I was a freak. And the people in the ambulance, and my SO, and my family, and the doctors. So thanks for that. But now because it has happened, and I know what it is, I don't freak out about it as much.



**So back to the parasite that has been giving me the most grief as of late.** I don’t know for sure, but I believe this parasite may be called **PPD (Paranoid Personality disorder).** It fits the symptoms. It is always whisper things to me. Makes me paranoid. It convinces me that the people in my life closest to me are betraying me in some way. That my SO is cheating on me, or hates and is pretending to like me for some sick joke. Whenever my SO says something, it reads deeper meaning into them and assumes the worst. If my SO smiles, it tells me he’s happy because he’s been talking to another girl. If he’s ever texting anyone or on facebook or whatever, it tells me he’s flirting, or making plans to meet up with another girl. It tells me the people I live with are trying to kill me, poison my food when I’m not looking. If anyone says ANYTHING, it reads ridiculous meanings into them. I know that it’s ‘it’ thinking those things, and that maybe ‘it’ believes them, but the real me doesn’t, and thinks ‘it’ it a lunatic. It makes me think other weird paranoid thoughts too, but I can’t be bothered to list them all.




**Then there’s the little gem of the family. The one I love, the one I never want to leave. Then one I’d happily set up a 5 star hotel in my brain for it. The one I call ‘up’. Up is my favourite thing in the world, because it makes everything more beautiful, and makes me appreciate all my other favourite things even more. When Up is awake, Depression is asleep, so is SAD, PD and HA. “It’ and GAD are still up, but cower in the shadow of Up. Up doesn’t give a shit what they say. Up is a ray of sunshine. Up fills me with energy, motivation, hope, happiness, creativity, ideas, strength and love. I feel like I can do anything and everything. I want to achieve everything. I bounce off the walls, working on at least 10 things at a time, jumping between them. Up is a shield to negative thoughts for my brain. They try to get in but get disintegrated instantly. Sometimes it stops me from saying anything because my mind is too busy taking in everything around me, everything looks and feels stunning, especially the sky, and trees. But when it does make me talk, I talk a lot, it adds up to a year of talking in just half a day. If I’m out at a party and Up is there, I talk to strangers as if they’re good friends of mine. And that’s without alcohol. I lose the feeling of needing to depend on other people for my happiness. I love music very much, so many masterpieces out there. But when Up is listening with me, I seriously get what I can only describe as orgasms in my brain. It’s like the feelings my *cough* lady parts get when I have an orgasm. Except in my head. And even better. Then everything feels so good, I feel like I feel the music through my body, in my soul (if there is such a thing). I feel with every fibre of my being that EVERYTHING will be okay, that EVERYTHING is wonder and amazing. I get this feeling of being one with the universe, I know that I’m just a tiny little dot in the scheme of things, if that. But I feel so happy about it, so happy and grateful to be alive to be experience life. I keep saying thankyou, I’m not sure to what or who. Just whatever it is that made it possible for everything to exist, and me, and the feelings I feel. When Up is out I don’t resist, I let myself become up.**




**Just one day** of feeling that way, is worth years of torture the other horrible little parasite put me through.



I started this letter with horrible feelings. I felt so sad that I’ve never met anyone who can understand what it’s like to go through the bad things, that often gets me down. When people close to me call me paranoid and weird. Make it clear that they think I’m faking it when I say that sometimes I just have no control over it. They’re mental disorders. I’d stop feeling depression, anxious, paranoid etc if I could. I do my best. I rarely act out on it. I almost never act out on my anger, because the real me keeps reminding me that if I wait and calm down, I will know that the anger is not me, it’s “It”. Occasionally it’ll spill a few words out my mouth. Never anything mean, just speaking how upset it is as it thinks I am hated. On the outside I appear relatively normal. On the inside it’s absolute chaos. It’s not as easy as just turning it off. All I can do is try to dismiss all the horrible thoughts and feelings and keep distracted, and not let the parasites control my actions too. I do try my best, I really do. But there are times I just can’t handle it. I never feel like I can handle it, but sometimes it gets completely out of hand and I let my cover slip a bit.



**To the people close to me,** 



If this happens, I’ve told you why, I’ve told you I’m sick, so please don’t be mad. Please don’t put me down. Just because you’ve experience anxiety a few times in your life, doesn’t make you an expert. That is just a bit of anxiety. Not pleasant yes, but believe me, having the disorder is quite different. I’m not mad I swear. I wish you all could understand, but you cannot and it’s not your fault. It’s because you’ve never experienced first hand the chaotic mess off it all, and I’m glad you haven’t. It’s hard to empathize I know. In fact, the only reason I’ve become such an empathetic person is because of GAD. There’s a positive I suppose. So next time I’m having a horrible time of things, and if I unintentionally let my guard down and complain a little about it, please don’t be mad, and please don’t tell me there’s something wrong with me. And don’t tell me it’s not that big of a deal, that you’ve felt anxious or sad before so you understand all of this mess. Then proceed to say to just get over it. To ‘just stop’. 



**And please don’t taunt me, it really hurts.**



**Remember it’s not me and it’s not my fault. It’s not even a part of me, it’s not my character or personality. 
 They are just parasites in my brain. Messing up my chemicals. And I’m doing the best I can with that.**

I thought I was 'okay' for the last few days. I've been hanging out with friends, but I could never get you completely off my mind. Everyone says that it will get better with time, but will it? I don't see it right now, but I'm told there is 'light at the end of the tunnel'. We had a lot of good times, and a lot of bad ones. Oddly enough, I can remember the good times the best. I don't think I'll ever forget laughing with you until it hurts, or how it felt at the top of 'love' mountain. I never wanted you to be a distant memory in my past, but that seems to be okay with you. The constant fighting and bickering over menial shit sounds so silly now. We used to have something amazing, and the feeling was incredible. Then again, what I'm feeling now is pretty incredible too.

I only can wish things would go back to how they used to be, but i know they won't. I said some hurtful things to you on Tuesday when we finally ended it. I didn't mean them, I was just trying to make you feel hurt and betrayed like I did. It was an immature thing for me to do. Not hearing any pain in your voice really hurt. 

It's not like I didn't see this coming. I can't even count on my hands how many times we have gone through this. When we first started dating you broke up with me within a WEEK because someone told you a lie. We got back together but within a month you ended it again, which  I later found out was because your ex from 2 relationships ago was coming to visit you on valentines day. I had to borrow money for my mom for those flowers I bought you, and they just went to waste. None of those times that we broke up, did I feel like this. I could hear it in your voice this time, we are done for good. 

I loved you being there to support me. I wish I would have treated you more like a 'princess' throughout this entire relationship, and that your family loved me like you wanted. I took what we had for granted, just like my mom told me I was. I didn't believe her, I was too good for that. 

After we graduated Highschool, we had about a 1 month breakup. Even though we were still commuting together to that Community College class, I was beginning to get over you. I was talking to other girls, and even had a good lead with one.  You were talking to other guys too, and would regularly brag about making out with dudes at the club. I skipped your graduation party to hang out with that girl, but got burned in the end. Later that night I caught her making out with my best friends bro and it killed me. I remember they put my drunken self in b's old room, then I called you crying and calling you the wrong name. You didn't hang up on me, and listened until I fell asleep.

Then it happened. The next day I woke up at B's and drove back to my dads. My mom called me while I was sitting at my computer, and immediately I could hear that something was wrong. She was very emotional, and told me that there were complications with my Grandmas surgery and she wasn't going to make it. I visited her a few days earlier and fed her jello. It caught me completely off guard, and I had no one. After I went and hung out with the family for a little bit at my Aunts, I came home and you came over. You laid with me in bed and rubbed my back as I sobbed. You were my angel and I miss that. We stayed together for a 2.5 years after that, until now..

 I don't see us getting back together again, I told you never to contact me again and I don't think you will. You said that you wouldn't 'move on' right away, but I can't tell. I don't even want to know. I'll move on, but it might just take me a while.

I think I can only wake up once you awaken to my interest, but that book was shut and shelved before I had the chance to say hello. That ring embodies surrender and commitment, and it is the nail in our rickety, cheaply constructed coffin.

I will likely sit here, collecting dust as my own self-destruction inevitably peaks out from around the corner and promptly snowballs my direction. In fact, that seems to be an annual event, and one I remain prepared for.

I will go to work. I will come home. I will review the news. I will watch TV. I will think about you. Then, I will dream about you. The cycle will repeat itself until I'm no longer required to see you. Unfortunately, with ties as they are and loyalties as they stand, *I will always have to see you*. 

Are you wondering why I hid behind music and pictures the last month? It's all I can do to keep the fire drenched, to prevent the feeling of my chest caving, the flashes of a life I wish I led. It's always a group engagement, and I could never let the other eyes catch the magic you stir in me. Kingdoms could fall from such selfishness. 

5 years have I known you, but a conversation with you is out of the question. I'm much more comfortable as an observer, quietly watching you move the tides, calm the storm, play the music, and remain the moment's only constant. Sometimes I get the feeling you want to see the movement you cause in me, but I remember that the life you lead is not one to walk away from; nor is mine.

With only impossibilities on our side, it's obvious our time wasn't allotted for; we weren't scheduled for mutual rebirth. I just hope the vivid picture of a life I long to see stays intact, just long enough for me to pour out these heart beat missteps and shaky breaths into a medium for public absorption. Maybe I can connect with another dreamer, or receive final confirmation that what's within me does not warrant the world's attention.

I feel stifled.

I never asked for this. I never wanted to come home every night and update you about what I’m wearing, who I’m with, where I went. I think it’s stupid that I have to spend my time trying to defend myself against your accusations that I have herpes. I hate waking up at one in the morning to texts asking why I’m not speaking to you. Because it’s fucking one in the morning, and I’ve been up since 6:30 for class— that’s why. I hate that when I’m upset, all you do is probe and push and make assumptions about how goddamn bitchy I must be and how much I must fucking hate you. It can’t possibly be that I need space, like I’ve always needed for all the fucking times I’ve been down. No, it’s probably because I’m a childish heart-stomping whore who can’t stand telling you every single fucking one of my thoughts.

I don’t have room for melodrama and neediness. I don’t care that you’re “updating” your OK Cupid account. I hope you find some fantastic OK Cupid girl who never parties, never gets cold sores, and doesn’t have a mind of her own. I hope she’s transparent and vomits everything she ever thought or felt. I hope you find some girl that doesn’t mean it when she says, “I don’t want anything exclusive,” and does everything you want her to do. I hope she sits quietly at home humoring you and your requests and waits by herself while you “go out” with your stupid ex-girlfriend that you were so hung up on less than a year ago. And I hope to god she never walks out of line for fear of stepping on your sensitive little heart.

This past week was so incredible with you.  I didn't care that you were sick.  I didn't mind spending 2 full days with you in bed just laying around, sleeping on and off, watching movies and shows.  I just wanted to be with you.  I felt such an incredible connection with you, all the way through to the core of my being.  I have never met anyone like you before.

When we met so many years ago I was so infatuated with you.  I had a serious crush for sure.  But I was seeing someone and I knew you wanted more.  I was so young and awkward, but we had so much fun together.  I wanted to be your friend at least to be able to continue to get to know you, but you walked away.

Then I saw you.  I wasn't completely sure that is was you until you noticed me outside.  My stomach started to flip, my heart was racing.  I couldn't help but think of the chances that you would be there.  It took everything in me to stay calm and collected.  To act as if the chance meeting was just that.  To act as if we never talked again that it wouldn't matter.

We Facebooked... I tried to keep a distance.  I had made a decision previously to not allow another intimate relationship in my life until my daughter was 18.  It had just been too hard.  Too taxing on my soul.

Your smile is infectious.

I gave in.  That first night we hung out was excruciating in so many good ways.  I felt such an strong pull towards you.  Did you feel it to?  After that I would just try to find  ways to get you to want to hang out with me again.  It wasn't difficult.  That first kiss.  After all this time, all this waiting and wondering what it would be like.  Perfection.  It was like you new everything I liked instantly.  When you bit my lip I thought that I was going to fall to the ground.

We could have conquered the world.

This past week.  What I would give to live it over and over again.  But it all ended as abruptly as it started.  The news.  Is the entire world against me?  Why did I have to let you in?  Do I even care?  Even if I told you that it didn't matter, and that I just want to be with you, would you change your mind?  Would you let me back in?

It has been so long since I have felt this way and it was so wonderful.  I don't want to be sad anymore.  I want to love you.  All of you.  To show you that someone out there loves you for everything that you are no matter what.

I will probably never get that chance.  I will probably never find this again in my lifetime.

P.S.  I can't help but get the feeling that you want me to hate you.  It seems like you think it would be easier if I could hate you for this.  I am sorry but I can't.  I wont.  I wasn't even going to text you today.  YOU TEXTED ME.  And then silence.  Just be honest with me.

When we first broke up, I spent an extremely long time thinking about what was wrong with me as a person.  I reached the conclusion that I didn't deserve to be with someone as good as you… that you were out of my league, and more broadly that I was emotionally incapable of making the compromises and changes necessary for a functional relationship.

I spent the last three months thinking like that.  I tried, at first desperately and later with a degree of resignation, to be your friend, in hopes of salvaging some level of self-respect.  I turned down the opportunity to enter several relationships on the theory that I was saving the girl from the inevitable pain of my failures (Even when the girl in question was far more compatible for me than you ever were).  I considered myself to be fundamentally broken as a person, and every time I saw you at work reinforced that belief a little more.

I’m done feeling like that now.  For various reasons I won’t go into here, I’ve started looking at things objectively.  I looked back on our relationship with wiser eyes, and I’ve come to a few realizations.

You used me.  Our entire relationship was you using me.  It started because you enjoyed the ego trip of dating a much younger guy, continued because you enjoyed showing off that you had gotten a much younger guy, worked for a little while because I was willing to bend over backwards to make you happy, and even after all else had failed you waited to break up with me until I’d finished all of the outstanding projects you needed done around your house.  You knew how easy I was to keep content (all I wanted was company and occasional sex) so you took advantage.  I was a toy, a tool, and a salve... but I was never an equal.

Not only did you use me, you also deliberately sabotaged me to feel better about yourself.  When we started dating I was healthy, working out, building projects in my spare time, and generally spent almost all of my free time improving myself.  I drank occasionally but always responsibly.  With your encouragement I stopped doing all of those things… I became an alcoholic right alongside you, stopped building things, stopped eating healthy, and worked out a whole lot less.  I don’t think you liked the idea that I was better than you in some respects, so you tried (succeeded) to drag me down to your level.  Then you used all of those things you had encouraged me to do as an excuse to justify breaking up with me.

Do I think you did these things consciously?  No.  But the fact remains that you did them, and you only could do them because I was emotionally immature and vulnerable.

In a way, I thank you.  Hard lessons always take better, and I’ve learned far more about what I am worth as a person because of what you did than I would have otherwise.  I can, thanks to you, finally stand on my own in every aspect of life.

Does that mean I forgive you?  No.  The way you acted for the last year did some severe damage to my life, health and psyche, which I’ve only begun to repair.  It will be a long time before I trust a woman again, thanks to you… but at least I finally trust myself.

Goodbye, Allison.  I don't believe I'll be thinking of you much in the future.

Sincerely

Saregos

I hope you are well.

I have no idea why I'm contacting you, but writing this brings me some peace. I don't want to cut you off. I at least want you to let me have a digital temper tantrum.

It's sad that two people that brought eachother happiness can also hurt eachother.

I cut you off because I couldn't handle the break-up. I'll use Pink Floyd to say I ""built a wall"". I became ""comfortably numb"". Maybe I want closure now. Evidently I'm not over you. I was and am very mixed up about the whole thing and had massive guilt issues to the point of feeling suicidal. I don't expect people to understand, and this can be very shocking and confusing to others unfamiliar with major depression. It might help to read up on it, though, you did tell me you don't get the ""guilt stab"" that people talk about when hurting others. You are also psychologically manipulative. That's your problem for which you should seek help to address. In any case, my depression has carried on for about a year since I broke up with you, and I've been for counselling, therapy, and am now seeing a psychiatrist, with a view to start a course on some form of antidepressant. I often don't like myself.

When we were going out, you ""whined"" at me a lot about how your ex-boyfriends relationships failed, to me. How you didn't like yourself. How you were cheated on. How you cheated. How ""whiney"" they got. I tried to understand you and aid the catharsis, but I was also smitten with you. I'd have listened to you say most things. I wanted to protect you and love you better. I tried to succeed where you said they had failed. Part of me still does, which I don't think is healthy for me.

I hold you in such high esteem for your intelligence and beauty, and I think you'll go far. And you were very honest and upfront about your expectations -- qualities which I admire -- but back then I totally ignored them due to being smitten. I got hurt trying to pretend to meet those expectations and impress you. I tried to be your knight in shining armour, and when I fell off my horse (really more of a rat by that point), I reached out for help from you and you kicked me when I was down. Don't do this to others when they don't meet your standards. Are you sorry for doing this? I think that with a little empathy and support I could have gotten back on my rat and ridden to Camelot. Or something. Learn this or learn to stay away from people with any weaknesses, or there will be a lot of pain in your wake.

I started to set standards for you, for which I am very sorry. I think I was some seriously bad news for you which you didn't need. I reiterate: It's sad that two people that brought eachother happiness can also hurt eachother -- but I am not that person you fell in love with (I never was nor want to be), and neither are you to me. I pretended to be someone you'd like, and I ignored that which I knew was incompatible about you to keep the relationshit ""alive"". I think I'm closer now to accepting you for who you really were.

With this in mind, I look back to how we were as friends, and though I still was pretending to you to some degree, I feel I was much more myself when we were friends. That's how I'll remember it.

I've had a year and a half to push these feelings as far away from my mind as I could. For awhile, I did a pretty great job. I wrote about you constantly, until I couldn't anymore. And then I let go. I accepted that you never wanted to see me or talk to me again, I accepted that you were with someone else and I accepted that I'd never wake up next to you again.

Unfortunately, accepting something and moving on from it are two incredibly separate things. I've tried to move on countless times, but no one has affected me the way that you have. It's pathetic that I'm still stuck in this purgatory, but nobody else is you and that's proven a problem for me. Even so, I let go and I stopped thinking about you a million times a day, I stopped checking your tumblr and your last.fm religiously.

And then I saw you at that party a few weeks ago. It was the first time I'd seen your face for longer than a passing moment in over a year. I felt gutted.

And then you emailed me. I nearly had a heart attack before I even clicked on the email. It was just common pleasantries, but it still felt like a huge deal to me. I've made a fool of myself in the past, getting drunk and emailing you when you had no interest in speaking to me. But then *you* contacted me. And I wish you didn't.

Five steps forward and ten steps back. A mutual friend told me the other night that you broke up with your girlfriend. Maybe you were just contacting me to be nice and to catch up, but I couldn't help feeling a glimmer of hope. 

Just the fact that you thought of me made my head spin. There is no bone in my body that wants to stop talking to you, even though we don't talk about anything serious or substantial. I never stopped craving contact with you.

But the thing is, I cannot move on if there are parts of you lingering in my life. Truthfully, I don't want to move on anymore. I want to tell you these things, I want to tell you that I miss you and that if you'd ever take me back, I'd shamelessly come running. But that's not an option and I'm fully aware of that. I write these words here so that I do not send them to you, making it impossible for us to ever be civil or to ever have a friendship down the line.

So, please don't contact me anymore because it messes with my head far more than I'd like it to. There is no such thrill as finding your name in my inbox, but I can't deal with the mental repercussions. I'm still not ready for a friendship or a meaningless correspondence because I am still in love with you.

Even so, I will always be here if you need me. No matter what. And if you ever miss me the way I miss you, if you ever want me the way that I still want you, after all this time, I am ready to love you so much better than I did the last time around. We ended things on an ellipsis and the story we began is one I'd like to finish someday.

Until that happens, I'll be starting all over again trying to move past this. And if it never happens, I wish you the absolute best in life.

Does it please you, perhaps, to know that I wake up, time after time hurting myself in my sleep, believing that I am the monster of my own nightmares? Do you think it pleases me to know that I will wear multiple scars FOR THE REST OF MY FUCKING LIFE because you lied to me about the death of a child you never even had? Do you think it pleases me to know how long it took to finally start getting over the events of last summer, only to have it all erupt out again because you decided to apologize by email, six months down the line? You think it pleases me to cry, yet again, over something that in the end meant so little to you that you couldn't even open the door to talk about it? You think it pleases me to remember how I sat in my car that final time, for nearly a full hour, begging you to come talk to me when your only response was that you were too comfortable inside watching TV and to try again tomorrow?

You think it may ""please"" me to know that all of this happened only because you lied, over and over again, but it's okay now because you've decided to take a shallow responsibility? That it may please me that I nearly killed myself over the things you accused me of? That I, for lack of a better word, became you? Because you were too busy hiding lie behind lie to protect yourself from everyone who cared about you? Yeah. It makes me feel so much better to know that you've grown up, you've moved on, and that you're not acting like you used to. Surely, that helps me come to terms with how selfish I must have been when I asked you to put the idea of marriage on hold until, you know, we were actually dating? Surely it helps me come to terms with the confusion I felt for all of those months. And yes, it helps me come to terms with being a piece of shit, scumbag rapist like those who have abused both of us. More than anything, it helps me come to grips with causing the miscarriage of my child, borne to a woman I genuinely fucking loved. It makes it completely all better now because, hey: that never actually happened. All those tears didn't have a purpose. All that shame didn't have a reason.

Let me understand this: You expect me to believe that you did and said those things BECAUSE you loved me but were afraid of being happy?
Thanks, but no thanks. Get Fuck'd.

You want to ""counter your bad actions""? You want to apologize? Apologize to my parents who couldn't understand why, in a matter of weeks, I went from talking excitedly about the girl who they watched sitting on the porch with me, to needing a therapist - much less the rest of what they endured to watch after my breakdown - all in a matter of weeks. Go apologize to Jade who still hates me after you threw her under the fucking bus so that you could keep telling yourself nobody cared about you. Go apologize to my best friends, who I cut away simply for trying to help me. Apologize to those who I lashed out at when they tried to comfort me. Apologize to those who I broke down right in front of, none of them truly even knowing why. Apologize to my manager, who took me aside and listened for hours as I spilled my fucking guts out, after she noticed the self-inflictions on my arms and neck.

I wanted nothing but to love you. I wanted nothing but to be there for you. I wanted nothing but to care about you the way that you insisted nobody would, because I fucking saw that good in you that it apparently took you six months to realize wasn't me trying to get you to unzip your fucking jeans. I wanted NOTHING but to help you overcome the demons in your life, because I suffered from my own. I never once asked you to be a perfect person. I never once demanded a thing from you except for you to let me love you. You think this is something that I will laugh with my friends about? I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm ashamed of what I became and what I am, even right now writing this. I'm ashamed at seeing red for hours after you sent me your explanation of why you wouldn't take my phone calls. Do you remember that? ""Sorry, I was too busy getting my brains fucked out."" I'm ashamed that I am still so fucking gutted every time I think about you. I'm ashamed that I die a little on the inside every time I use my hands when I talk and remember commenting about that quirk of yours. I'm ashamed that ""An Unquiet Mind"" sits on my fucking counter-top and I still don't have the nerve to finish reading it. I'm ashamed that I've let myself become emotionally crippled, and refuse to let anyone get close anymore. I'm ashamed that I find something to hate about every girl I've ""dated"" ever since then because I go out of my way to find things that remind me of you. I'm ashamed that I called it off once simply because a girl said she had family in Arizona, or rejected a girl because she might have looked a little too much like you. I'm ashamed I couldn't admit that to their faces. I'm ashamed that I can't glance down Foster Avenue without wanting to fucking wrap my car around a tree because I'd think of you. I'm ashamed that I feel like leaving flowers for a girl as a surprise is the most sickening trope in the book, because all I can remember is how excited I was to leave them for you. I'm ashamed that you have robbed an entire night of sleep from me as I wrote, and rewrote this more times than I can count now. I'm ashamed that I've been thinking about this letter for sixteen hours now, when a ""Fuck You."" is more than you deserve. I'm ashamed that I let you in. I'm ashamed that I trusted you. I'm ashamed that I wasted my time and my energy. I'm ashamed that I let you use me for as long as you did. I'm ashamed because I did it even though you told me you would hurt me. I'm ashamed that I still keep trying to understand why you did all of this to me for nothing. I'm ashamed that I still remember the good times, and how I would trade anything in the world to have them back. I'm ashamed that I'm ignoring every sensible part of me that is screaming at me to not write this, screaming at me to delete this letter, screaming at me to forget about you. I'm ashamed I'm not going to have the courage to send this to you. What I'm ashamed the most about though, is that even now, a tiny little part of me is begging me to beg you for another chance at starting over and trying this all again, because I'm stupid enough to believe you might even ""be a genuine person,"" finally. I hope that statement ring as hollow for you as it does for me, because I'm ashamed that I remember those words, too.

You made me hate myself.
You made me realize that I was just another piece of manipulative garbage, like everyone else who abused you.
You put me on a path of self-destruction far greater than I understood at the time.
You instilled on me one mantra, over and over, and I live by it now: If you love me, prove it. If you love me, prove it. If you love me, prove it.
I obviously never succeeded, and because of that you made me believe that the fault and burden lied solely upon myself: I wasn't ""passionate enough"", I was ""selfish"", I was only trying to ""get into your pants.""

You've got your life set down now. It's what you wanted.
You've got your husband, who treats you better than I ever could.
You've got your school, that was going great last I heard, and by now I'm assuming you've finished dog training courses.
And in the end, you even found time to do what you set out to do: You hurt me. You made me jealous. You broke me down in nearly every way imaginable.

I don't want to believe you are sorry. It nullifies too much pain. Believing you could want to go back and start over leaves me open to more manipulation, and I wont give you that opportunity. Believing that you are sorry makes me the villain for hating you. It takes far away too much of the anger that comforted me to know that you're as something as cheap as sorry. And yet, somehow unfortunately, the truth is that deep down, I want to believe you, because for fucks sake, I loved you and I hate that I still love you, if only because I still hurt this bad over it. I want to believe you because I promised you I would be there for you no matter what, because I was loyal. And you know better than anyone that I stuck it out for you far longer than any human should have to endure. Boyfriend or husband or not, I wanted to be your friend first before anything else and wouldn't even give me that, because you couldn't understand what it meant to love someone. You don't deserve to understand love. You don't deserve the privilege, and you don't deserve the right to be let in as far as these letter will take you. You don't deserve to be my friend because you never proved to me that you wanted to be one. And you sure as fuck don't get to come back six months later, to try and absolve either of us of the guilt and regret, through a fucking email.

You hurt me more than anyone on this planet has ever fucking managed to do, and I hope you understand the absolute immensity of that statement.

Congratulations, Becky. I'm bitter and angry and hateful.

I want so badly to get closure with you, to say that everything is behind me, maybe you've moved on, and I want to as well, oh god how I want to.. maybe this will help:

I hope you know that I haven't forgotten you, how could I, with everything we went through together. The first night you kissed me, that summer night in the grass. All those emotions that I couldn't understand. Getting in trouble for staying out till 1 in the morning when I had to be home by 9. 

Then, as we got closer and closer, till on that cold november day when we told each other about our feelings, on that bench by the creek. Walking home, with a huge smile on my face, oblivious to the freezing cold around me. How could I forget the days we sat together and talked for hours, about everything.. The midnight calls from you and your drunken best friend, asking about my roommate. 

How could I forget: Those nights we met up in the cemetery, sharing a smoke together. The day you came back from Rome and your mom caught me after I was supposed to have left. Adrenaline rushing through my veins as I raced home, because I lied and said I was going on a bike ride when I went to have tea with you.. 
The night your mom caught the 4 of us at 3 AM with wine and cigarillos.. 
Passing notes in Anatomy class, or being 3rd wheeled by that little imp H.P., or 5th wheeled by J.L.. though he was oblivious to it. 
The 'walks' we went on.. how we kissed each other, as if we wouldn't see each other ever again. 
When you told me about what happened to you in Mexico. Something that no one knew. How horrible it was, how I wondered how a god would let such horrible things happen to you. Oh how I wanted to fix you, to be your saviour.
You were the first girl to tell me that I was attractive, no one ever told me that before, it meant a lot.
How I cried in the airport when I read your letter. How much we skyped over Christmas break.

I can't forget that one of the first thoughts when I broke my arm was that now I could spend more time with you, I laughed at that thought, even through all the pain..

Then when you told me about what you did over the break, how I wrote it off as nothing. I thought I forgave you right away, but it wasn't as simple as that. How I tried to convince myself that it didn't mean anything. I was just scared, scared of losing you.. I didn't know how to react. As if cheating on me wasn't anything to bother about. But we weren't ""official"" because we were both scared, you more than I, of what it meant.

We drifted apart, because you said you just wanted a friend.. what was I then? I needed more. I wanted you to say we were more, because I knew we were.. So I didn't relent, until it couldn't last any longer..

I know I will never forget the pain of first heartbreak. Wednesday. The retching pain that tore me apart inside when we were over.. I couldn't eat, I just cried. I swear I thought I was going to throw up because of how much it hurt. That made breaking my arm look like fun, at least I had morphine for it. I would take an hour to walk home because I had to sit and say and sometimes yell to myself ""she's not coming back.. get over her"" over and over and over. Every time I said it, it was like another knife in my heart, but I had to get over you.
We didn't speak for weeks..
 
Then, in Switzerland, at the same bloody place we started to get to know one another, we rekindled, after I told myself I would stay away from you. We even went back to that church, you played the piano and it reminded me of the days after school, at your house. It was all too much. Then you wrote me more letters, explaining even more of what happened to you. We sat next to each other in silence, in that big hall. 
As we became friends again and when we caught the other couples kissing, how I wanted to kiss you, but we just laughed about it. 

Then our trip to London.. I avoided you, it only lasted a day, you noticed and confronted me. I just wanted to get over you.. Then that imp caused even more trouble, I lied to him in front of you, because I didn't want you to know I still had feelings for you. Then you walked in on me in the shower, I never told you this, but I did that on purpose. I knew somehow that you were going to come to use the bathroom, I left the door unlocked and I knew you would come. Then how you later told me that you wanted to stay in the bathroom with me, but didn't. I laughed because that's what I wanted too.
Then the plane ride home, we held hands.. it felt so good, it felt so real. But my stomach was in knots, what the hell did it mean? I thought we were over.

Spring time came around, we started to talk a lot more. We had our adventures in the woods, finding that little bridge, walking in the water. All the little things we did together, I can't forget them. 

Then how we drank that bottle of wine and kissed like we'd never kissed before, you urging me to go further, but I was too scared. 

The last time I saw you, in your cap and gown, the paintings and letters you gave me. The tears we both shed, promises of the future were made, we would reconnect somehow. I gave you one of my favorite sweaters, you were so hot to me when you wore it.. 

Then, we were thousands of miles apart. We wrote each other.. (I kept all those letters by the way) how I would excitedly open a new letter or postcard from you. Then you weren't afraid to go over the edge with me, you said you wanted the world to know, which is what I wanted, 5 months earlier. The first day were were officially dating I had to call you long distance with my sisters phone to ask what was wrong, because something was.

How could I forget your best friend told me what you did in that first month. I was the reason you and her couldn't be friends, she had to tell me.. 2 more guys?! This time it hit me like a tonne of bricks. What the fuck did you do that for? It wasn't working out, how could I trust you now? You said you were going to tell me, all I heard was lies.. 

I broke up with you, because I knew it couldn't work. It didn't break my heart, like it did the first time.. I knew you were going to cry, it wasn't how I wanted to do it, over skype in a coffee shop. 
You meant so much to me, so fucking much.. why did you have to hurt me like that? I wasn't even sure I should break up with you, but a friend of mine told me I deserved better, but to me.. you were the best. 

2 weeks later, you've got a new boyfriend. I hear you even want to drop out to move in with him, thousands of miles from home. 

You haunt me. I am always reminded of you and I hate it. I think I loved you. Now I feel like I wasted a year and a half.. I laugh now, but I really wanted it to be forever when it was happening. There is so much more that I want to say, so much more that I could say. My journal and note-books of poetry are just part of what's left of you in my life. I haven't spoken to you in months.. 
I told you I wanted to be your friend still, after everything was over, but I can't. I can't. I don't know if I ever will. My friends called you a bitch, a whore and much worse.. I said you were better than that. I said you were a diamond in the rough, but after everything happened I'm not so sure. You told me that I changed you, for the better.. That I was someone who made you want to be a better person, but you really make me think otherwise. 

I hope your happy, doing whatever you do these days. I feel so stupid for all this. I was so naive, so in love or was it lust? I am really not sure anymore. 

Sometimes I wonder if you knew what was happening the whole time, that you were a psychopath who manipulated me and used me.. because you didn't seem phased by any of it. 
I'm sorry for what happened to you, I know you have lots of things to work out, but I don't think I can let them make excuses for what you did. 

Damnit. I just want to move on from you. 

Also, I know you knew this, but I still think your dreadlocks make you look gross.

Wow. That was a lot more than I was intending on, but I needed to get that all out of my system. It's crazy because there is a lot more that I could have said..

If you ever see this I hope you don't think me crazy for picking this up again but I am both a writer and an artist and I tend to obsess over things until they are well and truly dead, like what happened between us.
I looked over my old journals some time back and it made me cringe how often I wrote about you. I remembered things  I had already forgotten about you.
I'm not sure where I'm going with this-let me try again.

I don't know where you are now. I don't know if you're still with Maddie or not but I do hope you're well.

One year and one month ago I told you I loved you. And the next time I saw you you were holding her hand. The months wore on and I saw you kissing her and interacting with her daily at school. I was never jealous. First of all I considered her to not be within a hundred yards of your type, seeing as she wasn't known for her pleasant attitude among other things, but I won't get into that. Second, you were never mine to lose. It would be silly of me to be so angry and jealous over something I had never had in the first place. I knew that because I was fat I would never be anything more in your eyes than what I already was. Don't deny it-the greatest benefit of being a quiet person is that you become skilled in people watching. When I was in love with you I had a bad habit of watching you when no one else was looking, and you were always hanging around those pretty types. The tiny, thin, pretty and loud girls who played helpless and dumb to get your attention. I was always the opposite. Tall, fat, quiet, sometimes cold and very normal looking girl who was pretty capable and introduced you to the second law of thermodynamics when we first met. I'm not saying those girls weren't smart, because they were, but they chose not to show it often. 

We didn't talk often but when we did it always left an impression on me. I was convinced you were the kind of guy I wanted and I could tell others thought we would make an ideal couple. But in the end I was never an option. I was bitter at first until I realized something. You watched me all the time. During lunch, especially when your girlfriend was sitting on your lap. Did you think me stupid? Did you think I'd never notice? That year was a good one for me- I began to change for the better and I knew you were watching throughout. Whether you liked what you saw or not remains a mystery and to be honest now I don't care, but I could tell towards the end of the year you had developed something for me. Whether it was a crush or something even smaller than that, I don't know but I sure noticed it. You tried making me jealous and when that didn't work you settled for watching from nearby which I wasn't aware of at first until that day your girl friend decided to sic herself on me. Not cool, by the way. Practice subtlety for the next girl, it's the least you can do. 

Graduation came and went, we shook hands, wished each other luck and that was that. The only problem is I haven't been able to get you out of my head since. It's become such a problem that I'm sure if I were a witch I'd Obliviate you out of my memories. We had so much in common, up until one year ago we got along so well; you were everything I could ever hope for in a guy. We both sing and play instruments, we both whistle, love Pokemon and HIMYM and countless other things. Whenever I was near you I was myself-you were the only person who ever brought out the best in me. And I can't help wondering that if we both hadn't messed up so badly, would it have worked out? Would you have given me a chance? Would I have trusted you?Would we still be together even if you're in Iowa and I'm in Michigan? I'm bitter. In fact, I'm angry. I didn't realize before-I guess I really needed to say this. I only wish I could see you so I could say it to your face. I'm not ashamed in saying it.

There's no way of knowing. I'll likely never see you again unless you decide to show up to our high school reunion which we both know you won't do. 

 Now that I've lost weight and feel way better about myself than I did then (take note that I've done all this for myself and for no one else), now that I feel a bit more in control of myself both emotionally and physically and feel that I have grown as an individual, I can't help but wonder what would happen if you could see me now. I hope you'll regret it, now that I'm starting not to.

So I say to you again: Good luck. Go ahead and study engineering and date more petite girls because they make you feel needed. Here's a secret: tall girls can do that too. Go ahead and play guitar for them as they sit and smile while I would have sung along and maybe danced horribly as well, but it would have been ok as long as it was with you. Go and try and get them into Pokemon: theirs will never be a match for my Typhlosion and Milotic. Go and try to recognize the song lyrics they sneaked into their sketchbooks. Watch her knit, sneak around her so she thinks she's alone when she sings to herself, laugh when she at the faces she makes that no one else can see. When you're with the girl you're going to marry, ask yourself if she does any of those things. I hope you remember me then, and realize that for a while, we were perfect for each other.

I'm taking this quote from HIMYM and I hope it stings, you son of a bitch: ""Go ahead and start your crappy, disappointing life that will never be nearly as happy as the one you could have had with me.""

It hasn't been that long, but we've got along together so well and have so much in common.

When we are together you seem to have so much fun and really enjoy us as a couple, and my company.

But when we aren't, you don't call. You don't message. There is practically no effort on your part. You seem so distant to me. You're a really good person but I want to know if this is something casual to you, or if it's serious.

I know it doesn't help that you do work a lot. It makes it even worse when you're moving state in just over two months for your career. But I would be willing to move with you if we could make something of this.

I've tried my hardest to see you more and I really do want that. You say you do too...but I don't know if you really mean it.

It could be just I have the worst timing ever and you're too busy with work and getting ready for the shift.

Or it could be that you're not actually interested and you're just lying to both of us.

I offered for you to come to Christmas lunch - you declined to spend it with your friend who will be alone as well. I can respect that. But at least give me another time that you are free to catch up!

While there are some little things that cause barriers between us seeing each other more often I really want to make it work.

But maybe I shouldn't - because I don't want to be strung along. I just want you to tell me where we are at so you aren't in my head 24/7.

I know you dont need me today as much as you did yesterday. Its comforting to see you moving on. That means youre a lot closer to happiness. 
I hope you find her soon. I hope she will be to you what I could never be and I'll watch marvelling how easy she makes it look. Like I used to. 

I'll watch you hold her hand. I'll watch you smile with her. I'll watch you weep into her arms while I weep alone. Not because I will forever be alone but because you are precious. You a memory I could never share, a fire that will never burn out. If you're reading this you will know that you are my rock, my metal, my father, my teacher, my guardian. You'll know because our passion almost killed us, it broke barriers and set the stage on fire.

1353646701.0,13,self.UnsentLetters,13njys,To the guy I met at the gym,letsmakethisright,16,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/13njys/to_the_guy_i_met_at_the_gym/,"
3 weeks ago you approached me unexpectedly at the gym. You told me some of the nicest things anyone has told me in a while. You gave me your number, said that you ""hoped I would call"" and then took off. Now normally I wouldn't think twice about this type of thing; if my experience has taught me anything it is to be extremely wary of someone that can be so swayed by outward appearances. But there was something different about you; you were not overly persistent and tiring nor overly cocky and presumptuous. You were unassuming, calm and confident in yourself. You were different. That is why I feel the need to explain myself; why I never bothered to call.

When you caught a glimpse of me at the gym, you probably thought that I was the most magnificent thing that you had ever seen. You said so yourself: you were ""speechless"". ""Lucky for me"", you probably thought, for ever coming across someone so beautiful. Want to know what I would say? Unlucky for you. Of all the pretty faces out there, mine was the one you caught, and that is why you are unlucky.

Everyone that has ever gotten to know me has come to the abrupt realization that I do not and will NEVER fit the mold of someone that is attractive. I've been told it's ""the halo effect""; letting someone's physical beauty influence other elements of their being - thinking that someone attractive is without fault. But then there's me, the one exception to this rule of thumb: Painfully socially awkward - and not even in the adorable, endearing kind of way; cracked to the core with abandonment issues and subsequent distrust of everyone around me; and of course don't forget the silly, immature, borderline childlike tendencies. Yes, there you have it: Me. Factor in the physical attractiveness and you have two opposite ends of the spectrum comprising a single person. A person that baffles her acquaintances; a face that oftentimes, is unrecognizable even by its wearer.

The way I am has definitely caused me problems over the course of my lifetime, and I'll be the first to say it: being attractive, although it has its advantages, often leads to more problems that one could ever imagine. First, there are the assumptions before someone even meets me; for the guys, a beautiful, faultless girl. And for the girls, mostly the same - although this makes me idealized by the former and hated by the latter. And then when they do meet me it's even worse: The guys come to the conclusion that I am ""different"" (seriously, this has been said to me numerous times) and although this is intriguing for a while, become bored and yearn for the stereotype they thought I fulfilled. As for the girls, they instantly realize that I am not someone that glides to and from rooms, that always looks immaculate or knows exactly what to say; and this is their chance to put me down - a phenomenon that basically comprised my entire high school experience.

I guess this explains why I never bothered to call you, and yes it is for purely selfish reasons. For once in my life, I wanted to embody this perfect angelic image that people associate with me and not subject one more person to this paradox. I didn't want you to take a huge bite of vanilla cake, only to taste chocolate, and be disappointed by it. I am not ashamed of the person that I am, but the effort put into these comings and goings are taxing. It would be much easier on both you and I if you simply remembered a beautiful girl that never called and I, a nice guy that just wanted a chance.

I had a dream that I was coming to see you. It was exactly how I had pictured it all in my mind. Me getting off the plane, bewildered and tired. You, wearing your suit, grinning ear to ear. I ran up to you, flung my arms around you. I had tears in my eyes. And you got down on one knee, and said ""listen, I know we said we would wait but... will you marry me?"" 

And then I woke up. In my cold, lonely bed. Without you. 

That's how it's been for the past month now. I wake up alone. No good morning texts. No meandering thoughts about the day. I miss it. I guess. But it is my fault, after all. I should have never done the things that I did. 

Sometimes I get angry. The mean things you said to me were inexcusable. When you told me that I was going to regress without you, it really hurt. 

But I promise that I'm still here. I'm still waking up every day and going to work. I still exercise. I still eat healthy. I'm almost to the weight I wanted to be when I saw you again. I look really pretty... for the first time in my life. I think you would think I'm beautiful. 

And I'm going back to school next semester. Biochemistry. I'm actually starting to shadow a few doctors. I want to go to med school. I want to help people someday. I think you would be proud of me. I'm doing everything that would make you proud. 

I wish you weren't gone. I wish I could still hear your laugh, the way it filled the room up. Your smile, your eyes, the way you used to hold me close to you while we slept. I miss it. I can't believe I messed up so badly. I tried to fix it, I hope you know that.

I feel like I'm going to be alone for most of my life. I hope this isn't the same fate for you.

I don't even know if you have looked at any of the things I've written on reddit. This isn't a throw away. 

My love,
There are so many things that I want to say to you. Things that I know will only make things between us harder. I can't stop loving you. I can't stop being in love with you. There are thousands of miles of water and land between us but every moment of my day I try to stretch my arms farther and farther trying to reach you. And now it seems that I can no longer call you mine. I can call you my friend (at least I hope I can still) I can call you by your name. But I can't call you mine. I know that you are going through a lot of things right now. I know you need to rebuild you before you can think of trying to be with anyone else. I know you think you're losing you mind and that you are a fuck up. But you're not a fuck up. You are the most wonderful man that has ever existed. You have inspired me to open my eyes to the world around me and try to spread happiness to others. I can't begin to describe how deeply you have touched my life. From that first ""hey"" my life was altered. A new path paved with bricks of truth and love. Then it all fell apart. I can't help but feel that it's my fault. I threw my problems into the pool of your mind and made it over flow. I'm truly and deeply sorry for that. You are my reason for breathing every day. And now I can't claim that anymore. I want to be what you need me to be for you, a friend, a lovely friend. As much as it breaks my heart to say it, I know i'm not what you need. You said I deserve someone stronger, someone who can be here for me and hold me when i'm breaking. The fact is though there is no one else that I want. You are the one I want to hold me when my tears fall, the one I want to have their arms around me when I wake shaking from my nightmares. But I can't have that. It seems as though that is something I can never have. For what seems like a lifetime I've been waiting for someone to come along to show me what compassion and true love is. I thought you were that person. I thought things would be different. I was wrong. I'm okay with that. I understand what you need. I know it's important for you to get your life together. I know you have to learn to love yourself before you can love anyone else. Did you really truly love me? Or did you only think you did? Was I wrong about that too? So many times you said it so many times you wrote it. 
This past month when you were getting help, I wrote you every single day. I looked forward to getting those messages no matter how short just to know you were still fighting. You said I helped you get through it. I'm glad I could be there for you helping you get through it. 
I don't know how to go on right now. It's like someone has just ripped my chest open and just has there hand around my heart, slowly squeezing it, threatening to rip it out but leaving there just to torture me some more. Maybe i'm not meant to find love and happiness, maybe my purpose in life is to help others pick up the pieces of their lives and move on. Maybe i'm meant to become a distant memory. All I know is that I've been left standing here with my heart shattered around me, and I can't put it together because i'm out of glue, I gave it all to you so you could put your head back together. And I don't know if I want to put it back together anymore. It's just been shattered so many times and some of the pieces have gone missing. 
I'll end this unsent letter. I don't know if you will ever read it. You might. If you do know this, I love you, i'm in love with you, I always will be. There is not any other person in this world who I want to be with. I can't pretend that I don't feel this way for you. I will do my best to be your friend and not complicate things. ""I have loved for a thousand years, I'll love you for a thousand more.""

Yours forever and always,

I know I'm not the easiest person to be friend to, but knowing this makes me all the more grateful for having you all. Banality be damned, I feel like we have something really, truly special and unique. We grew up together, our lives entwined (and entangled) forever because of our shared histories. We *are* each other, even from ten thousand miles away.

I know we all have our own lives of love and work and grad school and so on so we don't talk much these days, but I've never felt closer to you all. It probably has something to do with ""distance making the heart grow fonder"" and all that. And I know *I* can be distant at times, lost in my own world of ideas and ambitions, but were I to choose between any of that--scientific paradigm shift, toppling the evil corporate empire, a novel for the ages--I'd always choose you, any of you, even though you'd urge me not to. Because I wouldn't want to be steeped in a world of empty victories, celebrity to the droves I care little about. *You*--each and all of you--are the gossamer web that gives me place and meaning, the family I always needed in ways I never realized, the home I can always return to. (Only, now my home is scattered across the globe.) How, then, could I pick anything over you?

But really, more than anything, I'm happy to see where you all are now, the successful, brilliant, beautiful crew that I always knew you were. We limped and crawled through college and beyond (and sometimes still do) together, but now that clouds have cleared, the world can see you for the effervescent luminaries I've always known you to be. I've long believed that the Universe was somehow bettered for having passed its atoms through you, but now I have objective, external proof that this is true. My heart bursts with pride for you, for how you've pulled yourselves up and out.

Listen: I've never been good at love. You all know this, as do my many fleeting lovers. But somehow, over the years you've shown me how to love (you, myself) in a truer, deeper way than I ever thought possible, and for that and so much more, I love you.

When I was child I used to think when I became older things would get better.  I remember thinking when I'm an adult I'll be free of this.  I'm still waiting.

As I'm getting older the realization of the reality of my situation is abundantly clear.

After 33 years things never got any better.

I grew up in a home with a man that used to beat my Mother with pieces of wood, pieces of furniture; until she screamed.  She always told us she'd leave him if he hurt us.  She didn't leave.

When I started puberty the abuse turned into something more.  He tried touching me, he tried watching me..he tried things no father should ever try.  I told her.  She didn't leave.

I got out.  I thought I was free.  But I entered a relationship that was similar to my Mother's.  He hurt me for 9 years, but I left.

I married a man that I thought loved me.  He cheated, he lied, he abandoned me, he made me feel unworthy..

33 years.

If anything I've learned a few things.  Sometimes no matter how badly you want to be loved, to be worthy, to not be left behind; sometimes that's what you're meant for.  I'll never understand why, nor do I really want to know.  What I do understand is no matter how much I loved the people in my life, I was never worthy of their love, their protection, their unconditional support; everything I had given them.

33 years.

I know I'm forever making a mess of things. I want to be better. I want to be the wife you deserve. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I just don't know how to show you that, or to tell you why it is so hard.

I wish I could tell you why I'm so fucked up. Why I suck at relationships, why even if I want sex, at times it terrifies me. I wish I could tell you about the nightmares, the flashes of memories that cause my panic attacks. I wish I could tell you why I slept around so much before we met. That it was the only way I could deal. The drugs, the alcohol, the cutting. It was always just a way to deal. To forget. To mask the pain. To pretend it didn't happen. But eventually I had to sober up, and there it was....the past staring me in the face.

I wish I could tell you about the abuse. But I try very hard not to think about it anymore. But it's hard. The reminder is always there. Heaven help that sick pervert if I ever see him on the street. I hope he dies the most agonizingly painful deal imaginable. 

I wish I could tell you what having drug addicts for parents was really like. Sure, they are mostly sober now. And dad seems to have his shit together. But even they don't remember the things I can. Mom sleeping around for whatever drugs she was trying to get, even in the same room as me when she *thought* I was sleeping just inches away. The random men she brought home that gave me creepy looks and I was always so terrified would find their way into my room in the night after she had passed out. Lots of sleepless nights with a knife under my mattress.

I wish I could tell you how it felt, knowing your own mother didn't love you. I know now she was truly incapable of love, but at five years old, I just couldn't figure out why I wasn't good enough. How their custody battle just felt like a way for them to injure each other more, neither truly caring about me. I wish I understood why my grandparents love wasn't enough to make me feel whole. Why I still don't feel whole. 

I wish I could tell you how I found a way to deal. What the hell kind of person starts sneaking and drinking as a 8 year old? Seriously? How fucked up is that? And how fucked up is it that no one ever noticed. They were all just too drugged and drunk to know we even existed. Drugs started just a few years later. By 12, I was snorting pills I could find and smoking pot. Fuck the people that didn't notice. And fuck the people that did but didn't care. And fuck the people that would pass a 12 year old a joint. Sick bastards. By 14 I was drinking heavily.  Again, it was never hard to get. Whether it was my mom supplying the booze, or a friend's. It was always there. I spend my weekends in a drunken drug-hazed stupor. 

Then back home and back to school I went where I had to act like little miss perfect. I hated having two lives. But I couldn't let them see me for who I really was. By then dad had remarried and she wasn't as blind as he was. Still, plenty blind enough though. There I was Miss Honor Roll,goody two-shoes, bookworm, nobody. Sure, I had friends, but very very few who ever even saw a glimpse of the real me. And I'm sure they thought I was bullshitting. That helped when my drinking began to spill over into my weekday life. Who would have ever suspected that bottle of water I kept in my locker was vodka? 

 I wish I could tell you that the reason I had sex for the first time at 14. How I decided it should be with one of my friends that I trusted and cared about instead of some random guy at a party when I was too fucked up to say no. I wish I could tell you that it was so awful that I didn't do it again for 3 years. But I'm glad it was a friend, because the next time it was some random guy at a party. And I was too drunk to say no. I still think he slipped something into my drink that night. But what could I do? Who would have believed a drunk 17 year old girl?

 I wish I could tell you how that sent me into an awful spiral. How I threw myself into a relationship with J, a toxic guy that constantly cheated on me and bragged about it to my friends. But he was the first one to tell me he loved me. And he touched me and kissed me and held me. I thought it was love. I was so naive at first, just 17. I finally saw through him a year later, and got my own revenge. At a party one night, I left him, and I took home his best friend instead of him. I honestly thought I'd just fuck M, and that would be it. Make J mad and jealous and move on. But then I fell in love, truly, for the first time. And less than a year later he broke my heart into a million pieces. 

I wish I could tell you that the almost two years between M and you was probably the lowest I've ever been. Sure, I'd been through worse than a broken heart, but this was different. With him I had finally let most of my guard down. No, he didn't know all my secrets, but I allowed myself to love. I wasn't going to do that again. I refused to put myself in a situation to be hurt again. So casual dating, friends with benefits and dating married men is how I spend my time, sober or not. And there weren't a lot of the sober days during that time. 

And then, almost by chance, you came into my life. I've told you how I wanted to stand you up that night. That the only reason I went out with you is because I had the munchies and wanted the free meal and drinks. I don't think I've told you how strange it was to be in your presence, and agreeing to go out with you again. How I didn't know what to think when you didn't make a move that night. Or the next night. You didn't even kiss me until our 6th date. Definitely not what I was used to.

I wish I could tell you that I didn't mean to fall in love with you. That I did whatever I could to push you away. But you stuck around...and I fell anyway. You've not learned some of these secrets, but you've torn down my wall and made me love again. 

I wish I could tell you, that sometimes I still feel like I'm pushing you away, just daring you to leave. Because that's all I've ever known. Abandonment I can deal with. It's the loving relationships that give me issues. That I don't think I deserve to be happy. I don't think I'm worthy of love. I've never felt like I was good enough. For anyone. Especially not with you, someone who is so much better than me. I know life hasn't been easy for you, you've had your heartache and pain too. But our upbringing was still like the blackest night vs. the warm glow of sunrise. 

I hope we can make this marriage work. I want it to. Because I can't imagine my life without you in it. I want you to be the one by my side as we face the world. 

I hope someday I can be brave enough to share some of this with you. But even typing it was a struggle I didn't think I could manage.

You're not gonna like what I have to say, and you might disregard it, and you'll probably think I'm out of line, but I want you to hear me, because I care about you, and I'm worried about you.

You're not an empathetic or introspective person. You've never had the opportunity in your adult life to really slow down and think about yourself. You've always been in pursuit of filling some kind of void. You recognize sorrow, but you don't identify with it, because you've never felt it. You know what solitude is, but you don't know how it feels. Filling that void has always been extremely easy for you, and you've taken advantage of that at every opportunity.

You never truly felt the weight of what you did to [1], because you were already admired by someone new, you had someone to lean and depend on. After [2], you strung [3] along to fill that void. Then there was me. Now, there's [5]. Whether or not anything is going on between the two of you is irrelevant. Whether or not there's intimacy or romance is irrelevant. It's still the same pattern. You found someone enamored with you, someone you can easily depend on, someone that will be there for you.

I told you, a long time ago, that when I first started flirting with you and coming on strong, I didn't care if you were still with [2], I didn't care what was going on between you and [3], I just wanted you. I never considered that, down the road, there would be someone similar, who didn't care about me. I don't want to sound like [2], but you really do have an aura. You have an effortless charm, and there's something so inviting about you as a person. People feel comfort around you. People feel at home in your presence. It's so easy to fall in love with you.

That's allowed you to continue to live the way you have. And that will be the case for a while. You say you haven't been single in 10 years, and you need to experience that. Those are empty words. You have no idea what it's like to be lonely. You probably don't even remember the last time you spent a night alone and just thought about your life. I doubt you've ever spent a night in your apartment alone. You've always had friends and romances to lean on, and I think that means you can't really appreciate them.

When I was stuck with the [burden], I was in a dark place. I had no one to depend on, no one to turn to. I didn't see a light at the end of the tunnel. I actually contemplated suicide. I'll never get back to that place again. I know there is happiness to be found after loneliness, but I needed that experience to understand that concept. Being broken up with has shown me that life doesn't have to fall to that point. My friends have been so amazing to me. I appreciate them more than I ever have, and honestly more than I could have imagined. I'm grateful for their part in my life, because I know what it's like to not have that. I know from losing you, from living with the [burden], from losing my house, from losing my mom, from never having had a dad. All of these experiences have been awful, but they've made me empathetic, they've shaped the man I've become. I'm obviously not perfect, there's a lot of things I need to work on, but I'm introspective enough to recognize that. It seriously sucks recognizing that there's a really fundamental character flaw in yourself, but the only way to fix it is to be aware of it, to experience the drawbacks of it.

You haven't felt the weight of dumping me, because you instantly filled that void. I've been depressed for six months, and you probably never recognized it. Maybe you really did love me, but you never felt the weight of that love, because you've never had to go without it. I loved you in a much more fundamental way, maybe partly because I understand what it's like to not be loved, but mostly because I could empathize with you as a human being, and I saw something extraordinary about you. You could never empathize with me, not really.

I'm just scared that you'll continue this trend. You have [5] right now, next will be someone else that falls in love with you, and this will continue for 5, 10, 20 years. There will be a time, though, when you've exhausted the trend. There will be a time when someone breaks up with you. There will be a time when you have no one to lean on. Your friends and your siblings will have settled down. They won't want to go out every night, they won't want you around all the time. You won't meet someone that will so willingly and immediately live with you. I don't know why you do what you do, but I'm scared that once you're not able to do it anymore, the weight of solitude is going to hit you like a train. You will have never understood what it's like, and it will be awful for you.

I just think you need to slow down, contemplate, and feel. You need to think about what you're doing with your life. You need to think about your life at all. You need to stop distracting yourself and escaping. It will make you a more empathetic person. It will make you a better person. It will make you a better writer. It might be an awful experience, but you'll never feel real love unless you know what it's like to really understand another person.

I fucked up. I'm sorry

It was a mistake. My mistake. Over the course of those short months you’d wiggled your way into deep, locked-up recesses of my brain, into places that I thought were completely closed off—places I thought nobody could see, let alone access. And then I ran away because you’d tousled up my neat, comfortable hair and I didn’t know how to cope. My world was safe and stable for so long, but you, with your disarming blend of wit and boundless generosity, found a way in, in an invasion that was wholesome and blissful and atrocious all at once. Paradox was always your forte.
 
The thing is, no one had intruded upon these sacred grounds since—I don’t even know… so panic-mode took over and I fled our soulless city of marble and monuments, the streets where everyone walked too quickly for me and too slowly for you. I fled because the bulwarks and ramparts I’d constructed were fortified against the cynicism and egoism I saw everywhere, but they were powerless against your unexpected, unselfish grace and unimpeachable kindness. These were strange, terrifying things, and I didn’t know how to respond, so I fled because, as you know, given the choice between fight and flight, I always choose the latter.
 
What I didn’t stop to consider was that I’d be leaving you wounded and alone, after having given me so much. Even worse, when I asked for silence so I could sort all this out, you obliged. I needed space, I said. You rarely denied me anything, but I wish you’d denied me this. Maybe, possibly, things would’ve turned out differently.
 
During those weeks in another city, what I found was that my internal world was arid and lonesome without you. You’d shaken me up, and when it settled, I discovered a better man, a braver man than I ever recall being. You believed in me, and somehow you convinced me to believe in myself, to believe in all those stupid, infantile, wonderful things that I’d given up on in the twilight of my youth. I started composing music again. And writing. I didn’t know it then, but I was a dying person before I met you. It through you and with you that I realized this-- that all my daily habits and routines and securities were just ligaments on the skeleton of a moribund beast. The architectural safeguards of a lighthouse that did not even shine. Our messy, terrifying world was infinitely better than the fossilized sanctuary I’d trapped myself in. Solitude was my prison, and you’d freed me, unshackled me from the delusion that to be a mature adult means I must be an unconscious, passionless, broken-winged creature.
 
When I came back to visit, I was practically pulsing with anticipation, ready to unload my grand revelations, the ones you’d waited so long and patiently for, week after week, month after month. I wanted to tell you that not only was there a place for you in my world, but that there’s no place without you. I never got the chance because somehow, over the course of those brief, eternal and excruciating weeks, you’d moved on and given up. I still haven’t digested it all, but your silence could not have been sharper. I knew that I’d come back expecting impossible things, not because of your words, but because of the presence of your absence, your eyes that never met mine. And so I didn't touch you or kiss you, though it was all I wanted, knowing that you were already far away and beyond reach. The only thing I fully understand is that this was goodbye. Final, irrevocable. So I let you go, because it was the only thing I could do, with hardly a protest to escape my stupid, stricken, fumbling lips that are forever yours.
 
I still agonize over that final moment, that spectre of a last chance, but could it have changed things?
 
I fucked up worse than I ever did before. I’m sorry in a way that I never understood until now. What can I do? How can I fix this? What the hell am I doing? Tell me, talk to me, answer your phone or respond to my texts. Give me something, anything. Because I can’t live in a world where our realities are mutually exclusive. Not after all this. And, above all--
 
Come back to me. Please.
 
Yours, always,

Even our first connection, I remember so vividly. And how I wish this curse would just go away. 

Worst of all, I remember the exact moment when my heart dropped to find a letter from you in the mailbox. The picture you drew ingrained itself in my head. The beautifully detailed rose with the words ""*pleasantfiction* and Diana"" under it. No words could describe it other than the gasp I took when these unworthy eyes looked upon a now destroyed masterpiece. 

It hurts to see that you've moved on. And I'm still stuck here waiting for the train that will take me somewhere that doesn't remind me of you. Unfortunately the outer edge of the universe doesn't have a train station yet.

I know we drifted apart every few months since we were 18, I'm sorry...I was trying to stop feeling like this. But now, two years since you left, 14 years since we met, six years since I decided that I could die for you, I still dream of you. My last dream was devastating, you told me that some guy proposed to you and you said yes, at least it was just a dream. I understand is a little selfish to think that way and if it ever happens I swear I'll try my best to hide it and be happy for you, or at least fake it.





I want you to be happy and have a wonderful life. I never thought I could deserve you. That's the reason I never said anything, that and the fact that I'm also a coward...maybe I could've tried to be a better person for you. You are water on a desert, a flower during winter. You are the reason I write love songs that I don't show to anyone, not even you. On a day like this that I feel sad without a reason I always think of pìcking up the phone and reach for you, but I won't do it, I'll just be a regular friend that gets lost only to call every few months to check if you are ok. I can't even be a good friend feeling like this. We were such good friends, and now we are the shadow of a memory.





Should I tell you that I love you? Should I just keep trying to forget that you are perfect for me? I really hope that as life moves forward I get to be next to you again, my beautiful girl with the sky in your eyes. I just want to be able to see all the colors in the world while you smile just one more time.

You say that every time I tell you that I miss you. You know I don't mean it that way though. You know I mean that I miss being with you. And yeah, we did have that conversation once. You said that I kind of still was with you. And you're right, friends with benefits is something. But it's not what we had.

I know how lucky I am to even have you in my life anymore, but I can't help but wanting more. I messed up. I messed up big time. 

I get excited every time I get to be with you. I'm so excited for this weekend that I can hardly contain it. It feels like our relationship is new again. 

You said that you don't want a relationship yet, and I'm okay with that. I'm willing to be friends with benefits. I love being friends with benefits with you, I still get to kiss you. It could all end though cause of one girl. Your best friend. If she walks in on us having sex then you're going to get up and run after her. I can feel the sting of it already. If she admits any sort of feelings or is hurt by the fact that we've still got something going on then you'll want to end things with me.

If I lose you then I don't have much else. But if I lose you then it'll be my karma. I deserve to be miserable and alone.

I gave you my resignation last week and have never felt better about it.  You have ripped off clients for years and now the people who work for you, I can't bear to watch it any longer.  I have lost sleep over this. The way you treat people has finally caught up to you.  This hasn't been a job. It has been a complete and total dysfunctional clusterfuck.


Up until recently, all you gave me was a paycheck. I couldn't have one single sick day without twelve phone calls. There were no benefits--nothing.  Now you can't even guarantee me a paycheck.  You can't pay anyone and the lies... oh my, the lies.  They make me sick.  You walk around here saying ""you aren't taking any salary"" insulting everyone's intelligence.  It makes the people you have left working for you lose respect for you--if that is even possible.

I have driven you to pick up your daughter from school, then taken the both of you home almost on a daily basis after work because you're on what.. your third DUI now?? I've lost track--yet you've not given me a penny for gas money.  It just somehow gotten lumped into my duties for the day.  YOU DON'T TREAT YOUR EMPLOYEES THAT WAY.  If anyone were to look up the word ""turnover"" in the dictionary, they would be presented with a picture of this company. It's sad. It didn't have to be like this. You had amazing people working for you--in and outside of the office.

Go ahead.  Bat your eyelashes and say to yourself, ""I can't believe that you have so much anger about this.""  You're wrong.  There is no more anger.  I've tied the relief valve open, and this is the last of the venting.  I've wasted far too much emotional energy on you, and I'm tired of it.

With regards to the anger, think about this.  You no longer wanted me as your husband.  But rather than have the guts to stand up and say something about it, rather than have the courage to do something about it, instead, you got involved in an emotional affair with a co-worker.  When I asked you about your relationship with him, you got angry, you changed the subject, you did everything but tell the truth.  And when I finally confronted you about it,  you looked me in the eyes, and you lied.  And then you blamed everything, including me, for what you did.  Everything except yourself.  And that's fine.

So, what was I supposed to do?  Tell you two to have fun?  You were already doing that.  No.  Honestly, there was nothing I could do, other than file for divorce.  You had this all planned out.  You told me as much at one time.

And yes, I was angry.  I was depressed, I've been through all the Kubler-Ross stages I don't know how many times.  But here I am now at acceptance.

I'm sure I'll cycle through Kubler-Ross a few more times.  But I'll always end up back where I am now.  At acceptance, which is where I need to be.

No more finger pointing.  I know now what kind of person I was married to. I accept the fact that you manipulated me over the last few years.  I accept the fact that you treated me like a doormat over the last few years.  And I accept the fact that those things happened, only because I let them.  I accept the fact that you cheated on me, along with the fact that you cheated with me, and that should have been the biggest red flag of all.  I accept that I made mistakes in our relationship.  But, above all else, I remained loyal and faithful to you.

That's it.  I'm done.  No more anger, righteous or otherwise.  I need to get busy living, rather than being concerned about a cheater.

Why? I have no idea. I've always been that person. Even when I first began to notice guys, I had a tendency to daydream and I began creating a mental image of what my prince charming would be like.

I'm also the girl who had crushes on guys who never felt the same way. I'm the girl that would run home and cry in bed until falling asleep. I was basically told I was not good enough and I somewhat learned to believe it. I knew I had so much to give but nobody seemed to want it.

I'm the girl who had yet another crush about three years ago. Many years after I thought I had outgrown that concept and had dismissed it as a ‘puberty/teenager’ thing. Many years after I had given up on the idea of truly falling in love with someone because life just *had* to be more practical than that. A prince charming would never come my way as such. Why did I have fall for someone then? I don’t fucking know.

I’m the girl who noticed the friend of the guy she was unofficially dating. The guy with the sweet smile (a smile I saw a few times and immediately stored in my mind);the guy with the blue eyes and with the smart, curious, and reserved personality that I quickly learned to respect and admire. A guy who I believed would enjoy many of the little pleasures in life that brought me joy. A guy who is possibly just like many other guys!

But crushes are not about just any guy right? Somehow, he was special to me.
He represented an idea I had been able to avoid for so long and he had come out of nowhere. This scared the hell out of me because I knew I was not good enough and I was already damaged. I was dating someone I didn't truly love just because I had already messed up a previous marriage and needed an 'emotionally uninvolved' relationship for a while. 

I’m the girl who made a bunch of mistakes from that point on. I’m the girl who lied in order to get closer to her crush. I’m the girl who deceived him, pushed him to become interested on someone who was me and not me at the same time. I’m the girl who made it all go crazy, soap opera, drama wrong just because I had no control over my feelings. 

So he moved on. Without saying much, he chose to distant himself. 

I’m the girl who cried days and nights thereafter. Not because of a rejection but because of my own actions (I never gave him a clear chance to reject me since I never presented my feelings as being truly mine). I had convinced myself that he was someone special and I had behaved like a child about it.

I cried so much because I would not forget him or forgive myself as easily and I didn’t. He stayed somewhere in my mind. 
He still lives there and I need him to go away. 

Years later, I’m the girl who has made every effort to get her life going, to act like an adult. I'm the girl who force herself to look for someone a bit more real. A guy with qualities and flaws that she would need to work through. A guy who would make her sad and happy and not just happy all the time. 

So, I’m the girl who found a decent partner and had a child with him; a guy who loves her and wishes to spend the rest of his life with her. A partner who does not believe in soul mates ,fairy tales, or true love. A partner who is every now and then fighting against his girl's fantasies and impossible dreams.

This girl needs help. This girl needs to erase something from her mind before it ruins her life forever. 

I’m the girl begging for a favor. I’m begging my crush to return and break my heart. I’m asking him to take a few minutes of his life and to please reject me loud and clear.

What you left me with, was a handful of questions, memories, doubts and self-regret. 

I know it is selfish of me but would you please help me?

 I can’t even begin to tell you how much I hate you..
LOATHE is not a strong enough word. You have made my life a living hell. I’ve had to tell those stories to the love of my life and it was humiliating. The first time you got physical, you were mad and shoved me into a wall, then it progressed to more, you’d shove me harder, two or three times, you’d hit me. I suddenly got ver talented with a make-up brush and long sleevesd shirts. The day you threw me down the stairs at your mother’s house and I slammed into the door. The time we went to the Sears Festival, I met a few friends.. some of whom were boys.. and you lost your shit, you punched me in the face, grabbed my hair and pushed me onto the sidewalk... but a chunk of my hair stayed in your hand. The day I finally dumped you. You followed me for blocks in your car, and then drove into a driveway only inches away from me, you swung your door open and hit me with it, you got out as I was winded and pushed me onto the sidewalk and started kicking me in the torso as I covered my face. Thank god Pierre Richard was in that field and yelled “What the fuck is going on over there?” it gave me a split second to run. I ran as fast as I could accross that street and to Pierre where I collapsed, he came to my side and asked if I was ok, I said yes, he helped me up and I ran. I have issues beyond issues from what you did. I have flashbacks of what you did to me, I have trust issues because of it and it causes problems in my relationship now. I finally have an amazing, loving, faithful man who would NEVER lay a finger on me in anger and because of YOU we have issues. Because of what you did it took me a long time to trust him.. when I should have the whole time. I still have issues trusting him... I DO trust him, but I have to remind myself sometimes that he deserves every ounce of my trust. You have destroyed , I’ve had to rebuild everything about who I am after you. You are a useless sack of shit, you are the scum of the earth, you don’t even deserve the title of “human being”, it makes me sick to my stomach to even think someone as repulsive as you exists in this world. You are the single most disgusting, repulsive, nauseatingly vile person I’ve ever had the displeasure of coming into contact with. I wish you would just die already. I wish you would die a slow and painful death, I wish you would suffer for years the way I have and then rot in hell for the rest of eternity. I loathe everything about you.

Because of you I can't trust anyone. I have lost all will to live because I've been destroyed by two of the people I trusted and loved the most.

I hope that one day you realize what you have done. Both of you. But that one day is going to be too late. I dont trust that your relationship will work because how can any relationship work when it was started by hurting someone else?

As you know, I'm a professional self-employed web developer of 10 years. I have been fiddling with computers and technology damn-near since I could crawl.

A couple of weeks ago you came to me wanting a simple couple-page site that would be a business-card site for a product you're developing and that you don't have any cash. I told you I don't mind giving you a few hours of my time for free. Since the product is aimed at parents who are potty training their kids, we descide that the website is going to be very colorful and you would design a 2D vector character we can have walking around on the site.

We finally agree on the functionality (basic pages) and I asked you to shoot me your ideas and I would get the design going and give you a mockup. Instead you send me ""final"" artwork in a weird format that looks like shit. I now want to scream not only because I would never had agreed to doing this site with your artwork (i'm tired of teaching people), but the fact the format you gave it to me in required rebuilding it in Fireworks. I'm frankly somewhat embarrassed to put my name on this. I don't want my clients judging me because of your horrible artwork.

Anyways, that aside as we start nearing completion of the site you tell me you want a shopping cart. I explained to you that we didn't agree on that at the beginning and adding that functionality now is going to take more time. I know you think it's a simple feature but the entire functionality of the site is going to have to change.. you wanted a flash-like website so I wrote it all in JavaScript. Your proposed changes are going to require more work than I can afford to put into this project. I have other clients too ya know, and they pay.

Since then you keep asking for more and more ""little favors"" that have each taken a couple hours to complete and I'm starting to feel taken advantage of and I'm sick of it. What's funny is that when I bring up the notion of having a web budget you finally confess about how the website is actually a business your girlfriend's grandparents just started up and you just offered to do it, why, because you did a shitty one in High School 10 years ago? So instead of just telling them you couldn't do it, you then decided to get me involved and waste my time too. Thanks for volunteering me to work on a project for free, you're the friend I've always wanted.

To make things worse, the next day you tell me that people are concerned over a posisble copyright violation. Turns out the graphics you sent me (the 2D character you desined) was in fact traced from a line of childrens books! I can't imagine WHY your g/f's Grandparents were so upset about the posibility of getting sued.. I expect this from the average Joe but you're a musician! You should of known that ripping people off isn't cool and that you will get caught.

The night you choked me. Wasn't fun.

When you would call me and tell me you didn't like one of my friends, I knew it had to do with their gender. You only had a problem with them if you weren't around. 

You started to drink more when I quit our place of employment. Working with you was amazing until I realized it only made you happy I was there, so you could keep tabs on me. 

After I changed careers and started to create a life for myself. You ran away. You couldn't handle my stable, independent, even-flow of a lifestyle. Everything was going well. You couldn't handle that while yours fell a part. You put to much effort into ""watching"" me. 

It wasn't funny when you called me at my new job every day to see who was flirting with me. Or if I had found any new men to sweep me off my feet. 

I don't know who made you this insecure. I don't know who screwed your head up.

We've known each other for a little under a decade! I absolutely hate that I've never met you in person. I've never held your hand, never hugged you with all the love I could muster, never punched you as hard as I could for all the times you've been a jerk. But I love you so, so much.

I tell you I love you and I'm pretty sure you know. I'm pretty unabashed at letting you know most of the time. We've seen so many ups and downs. For the times you broke my heart and tried to let me understand, it hurts to know I love you even more for being so kind. Yeah, you've had more ""total sweetheart"" moments than you've had ""ruthless jerk"" moments. Can you believe it?

Sometimes I wonder if it's because of the distance between us that you never pursued anything other than the strange relationship we have now. But then I remember how different we are and I still kind of cry from time to time. Do you still see me as a kid? It kills me that you don't know me as well as I thought you did.

My best friend. It's probably under delusions of grandeur that I call you this to everyone else, seeing as we've never physically been in the same room, much less the same state. I hope you never read this. I can't get over you; I still can't let go. I've told my friends I'm pretty much 100% over you, but just secretly, in my heart, I'm still holding on to that one time that you say you love me more than just as a friend. It'll never happen and once I swallow that, it'll make me cry all over again. 

I want to find happiness and fast-forward to the point in my life when I get married to the man I'll spend the rest of my life with so that I can finally let go of my perception of you. But I want you to be there whenever you can, because my emotions would be so much more screwed up than they are now if you suddenly dropped out of my life forever. Some day, when I'm older, I'll fly up there and give you the punch in the gut you deserve and never let you go from the hug that follows.

I love you a hundred tons. I wonder if there'll ever be room for that someone in my heart? I hope so, though. After the first time I cried over you, I told you my biggest fear was that we'd change. We have, in some good ways, and that's okay. 

I miss the time you were probably being reckless and we flirted so frequently. You called me one day and we talked on speakerphone for like, five hours. Ugh. There's just something about you that I've been so attached to and I can never get rid of you, even if I want to.

When we were together I always felt you'd defend me as I would for you and you were the only person I could trust. 

Today morning, I received a phone call from a mutual friend of ours who casually dropped in conversation that you were getting married this July - while I could not express anything to my friend, it felt like someone had reached inside and taken the heart I so carefully cobbled back together over the past 2 years since we haven't spoken to each other and tore out all the stitches. The sense of loss is... overbearing to me. For most of today, in fact, I've turned down phone calls from friends and just sat with my photo albums which I had stashed away at the back of cupboards, hoping to never have to look at them and seeing pictures of you and me, happy as can be, and I felt for the first time in a long time, that life has been irrationally cruel to me.

Tonight as I sat on the terrace of my building looking up at the stars, I remember a conversation we had when we sat on the roof one summers night drinking coffee and chatting under the night sky. I asked you what you thought our place was in this world, and you had remarked, quite simply, that it was to make other people's lives more bearable. I have, in time, come to understand this to be true. We both discovered the joys of reading The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy together and you introduced me to Kafka. 

I told you, on the night that we broke up, that if you need me, I'll always be there for you. I respected your decision because I respect you deeply as a person and you spoke the truth. I want you to know that the promise I made you still holds, RS, and I hope that the man you marry knows how lucky he is and treasures you as much as I did, and still do, albeit quietly. I am deeply grateful for having met you, and for allowing your grace to touch my life at a time when it felt that I would be bitter and alone. 

Thank you for being my friend, RS. I still wear the pendant you gave me as it reminds me in this day and age of what it means to have a real friend walk alongside you during the worst moments of life. I wish you luck as you embark on life's great journey with your fiancé.

I'm sorry that I suck. I'm sorry I was terrible to you throughout our entire relationship. It was my fault for dragging it on for so long when the realization came to me that you were more like a playmate to me, a friend, a brother, than a lover. I was selfish.

I'm sorry I was abusive to you. I called you mean names, I said terrible things that put you down. I don't mean to justify it at all. I was wrong. I have my reasons for doing it, but it doesn't detract from how it was wrong. No matter what you do or did to me, it does not warrant that sort of verbal abuse. We were wrong for each other and only brought out the worst in one another. I should have not tried to force everything and make it work. It was like putting two wrong pieces of the puzzle together. No matter how hard I'd try to make things work and fit, it just wasn't right.

I should not have tried to put myself more into the relationship when I wasn't really ""into"" it. I shouldn't have lent you money to put as a down payment on your car. I shouldn't have accepted the engagement ring. I just continued to push myself time and time again, to be into you, as much as you were into me. And when things weren't going well between us, with you falling more and more into an addiction with games, I tried to pull you out by pushing myself more into the relationship. Just hoping that you'd come out of it and see how I felt about us as a whole. I was desperate. I saw you as an investment starting to go bad and I tried to salvage it. I shouldn't have had that mentality. You were a person, an individual, not an investment.

When ""we"" ended and just stayed friends, I should have ended the friendship. I thought things were different between us than ""normal"" people and that we could transcend an expired relationship into more of a friendship plateau. Again, I was selfish.

It was wrong of me to be upset at your new girlfriend for forbidding us to be friends. She had every right to be jealous/mad. Whatever was between us, was just not normal. I felt thrown away and betrayed, but I shouldn't have felt that way. I was the one that treated you bad and threw you away originally. I was the villain. I was not entitled to anything. 

I'm crazy. I know. I'm sorry. But that's all I can say now that you're gone. I'm sorry. I fucked up and I hurt you deeply. I just hope that now a days, you're doing well and that you're happy and that she, and all your new friends are treating you much better than I ever did. 

**Edit**

I guess I have to clarify and make clear that this was an isolated incident, since now someone has brought up the fact that I am a bad person. This was one relationship, which happened ended about 3 years ago. I am ashamed of my own actions during the relationship. I should have known better. The relationship as a whole was extremely unhealthy, to the point of where I was raising him like he was my child. He did not work for an extended period of time, simply because he did not have the drive to do as such and it was extreme stress upon me (and that's the tip of the ice berg). We both had our faults. ""With every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."" I reacted poorly to him. He reacted poorly to me. It takes two. However, I'm not here to chastise him for what he's done. What is done is done. The point of the entire thing, was for me to get it off my chest. I wronged him, regardless of what he did, I apologize for my part of it. I know I did bad. I'm not here to air his dirty laundry or details of the relationship as a whole.

It is hard to understand why everyone is so mean to you.  I know how painful it is, how empty it makes you feel.  I know about the long nights when you can't sleep, instead staying up trying to figure out why this is happening to you and what you can do about it.  I also understand your fantasies about making them all sorry, what they will be like in 20 years, and what you would like to do to them to get revenge and hurt them as much as they hurt you.  I know how unfair it all is.

There is nothing I can say to make it OK, to make it fair, or to get them to stop.  There are many things in this world we can't control - other people are at the top of the list.  But there is something you can do that will help.  You can help what you think and do.

I know you are scared of them.  I know you think you are different from them, and not just different, that you are worse.  I know you feel like you are fatter and uglier than all the rest of them.  I don't think that is true, but what matters more is what you think.  Here is a secret of theirs: they all hate themselves, too.  They all worry about their big nose, their bad haircut, their shortness, or freckles.  Here is another secret of theirs: they hide it.  This is the primary difference between you and them.  Not that they are pretty, cool, thin and you are not, but that you aren't able to pretend to be something you are not.  This is why they hate you.  They want you to be like them, to hide their scared insides.  They are afraid to be themselves, and they want you to be afraid, too.  That is why they are mean to you.  That is why they exploit your weakness, why they are so eager to bring you down, and revel in their success at seeing you miserable.  Maybe they think it will make them feel better, and maybe it even does make them feel better in one way for a little while.

But they don't know you, and they only have as much power over you as you give them.  Right now, you are giving them power.  Why?  Why do they have so much more power over you than your friends, your family, God, and your own self?  Your only fault is to not know yourself and trust yourself.  This is the very thing they all tell you every day.  Every time one of them calls you a name with that disgusted tone of voice, what he is really telling you is that you are not being true enough to yourself.  When you realize this, maybe you will even laugh!  Maybe this is one way God is speaking to you, to try to remind you of what is important to you.  Although the other kids' reasons for being mean might be one thing, the reason you are hearing them is different.

The most important thing to remember is this: the things being said to you are lies.  They are not technically or figuratively accurate, and they are certainly not some kind of prediction about your future.  They will only bring you down if you let them... if you let them.  Did you hear that?  You are in charge of your brain.

In the end, this is part of your life.  You can't wish it away and replace it with another path.  It is only one part of your life and is only as important as you make it.  Remember what I said about you being different because you weren't able to hide your fear?  Well, that is really your strength, too.  When you hide your fear, you don't allow other people to try to make you feel safe.  You keep other people out.  Is that what you want?  Or do you want a life full of amazing, interesting, lovely people?  This is the good part of you, your honest relationship with the world, and the benefits you get from it.  You have a much fuller life because of it.  Isn't that a beautiful thing?

Lastly, knowing what an amazing person you are and what a rich life you can have, you need to forgive your tormentors.  I know this seems impossible.  But you need to do it if you want your power back.  Ask God for help, and anyone else.  You do have it in you.  Do it soon.  The less energy you put into them, the more you have for the rest of your life.

Know that you are a beautiful person, inside and out.  Trite, I know, but true nonetheless.

Now here I am, more heart broken than I've ever been.

First of all, I want to thank you. Thank you for making the last two years of my life so memorable. You introduced me to a whole new way of living, you gave me the confidence I needed to talk to people. 

But that's not what I want to thank you for, before you, marriage was just not in my plan. Why would I get married? I want to be a successful film director, I'm going to be travelling a lot, so unless I find a man who's willing to be dragged around, any marriage of mine would just fall apart. Why would I take such a sacred bond and destroy it? I know now. In the two years we were together you changed me view to ""No marriage, ever"" to ""Maybe marriage, if it's with him"". If you got down on one knee and asked me to marry you, I would say yes in a heart beat, no matter what I said in the past, I would say yes. You were my best friend, we argued over stupid things like best friends do, we were able to do the same thing every night for weeks on end and still be entertained by it, I never wanted to be with anyone but you. Who wouldn't want to marry their best friend if they could? But that's not how life works, I guess we were just too young. I mean how could I possibly have thought this would have worked? We were perfect for each other, but what good is having the perfect person at the wrong time?

Regardless, if I could go back in time, go back two years ago and repeat history, except avoiding our bumps in the road, I would do it. I know this is probably not true, but I honestly don't see myself loving anyone as much as I love you. You aren't perfect, but that's why you were perfect for me. You made me feel safe, you made me feel wanted. Now I'm unsafe and unwanted. I feel like I had a magic carpet bringing me through life the past two years, now it's gone and all I have left is falling. 

Secondly, I want to beat the crap out of you. I thought I was good to you, I took care of you, I loved you, I made you feel wanted.. At least, I hope that's what I did for you, and if I didn't, I'm really sorry. If I ever get another chance with you I promise that every day we're together I will take care of you, love you and make you feel wanted. Honestly, the past summer in America with you, I think I may have taken you for granted. I expected you to just know that I loved and wanted you, but I don't think I truly showed you that. God I hate that I love you so much. I hate that you left me while I still loved you so much. I really wish I could just wake up and discover that this was all one big horrible dream. But it's not. I wake up, I look over and see nothing but my stuff in our old room, I go to the bathroom and see you sleeping on the floor and I cry in the bathroom until I feel I can leave with out anyone suspecting that I was crying. I want to cope, I want to be strong, but I want to be with you more than either of those things combined. 

I want to be with you. I want you to want to be with me. But that's not how life works. I just wish you knew how much I love you, I wish I knew how much you used to love me. I really hope everything works out. For now I'm unsure what that means, but I'm hoping it means we both realise we can't live with out each other.

It is astonishing that you even continue to persist with me after attempting to crush me in the most pathetic, petty way possible. But dropping people like they are nothing, only to later pretend like nothing happened and you actually do care, repeat ad nauseum, is your M.O. It took me years to see this, but I was wise to your games even when we were together. I should have seen it coming a mile away, like I see your emails and text messages coming now. It is as if you work in a 6 month cycle of acting like I am negligible, only to turn around and act like I was your first ""true love"" again and again.

I was not your first true love. I question if you have any idea how to love. I should have realized that when we were together or got back together the second or third time, but I was convinced that you could change because you were MY first true love. I guess that is the big mistake of anyone who ultimately gets burned in the end. I am grateful for the learning experiences you put me through, and although it has taken me years to bounce back, I am stronger and more wise than I was before. Who I am now could not exist if it were not for who you are, and there is a terrible harmony to that truth.

Your fluffy emails about your happiest moments being shared with me are nothing but lip service to your own ego and your own fleeting desires for a genuine human connection. I know you wrote me with the hopes that I would respond as I always did, wording things in your scripted ""yeah man, whatever you wanna do, you are inconsequential to me, and it is me doing you the favor in even contacting you, because I have shown you many times that you are disposable"" manner which you always do. Yeah, maybe we could meet up some time if I'm ""up to it,"" except that I will never again be up to it, and I will no longer tolerate you in my life. I do not want you to even know that I even continue to exist. I want you to question my whereabouts and my well-being until you forget about me again and again. I am certain you have many of these cycles in your head for many people in your life that you have also revealed their worthlessness to. 

I won't be analyzing your letter too much because it is a contrived joke like they always are, just like everything you attempt to express as genuine. Your attempts to connect with people are only calculated strategies to serve your ego until you no longer have any need for them. You are a parasite, a vampire, and someone who I feel sorry for. Knowing you has shown me the true meaning of karma because you live this every single day. I have seen it first hand for years. I hope you grow and change and find happiness in your future, but I wonder if you will ever know what true happiness is. Your desires are fleeting, your capacity to care about others is trite, and you are someone who only deserves pity from those who see through your games.

You will never receive this response from me, but know that after years of contemplating, no response from me is the best side of me you will get.

Should we have any further unfortunate coincidences of crossing paths in public, know that I will look straight through you and walk by in silence.

Probably just wanting to pose before myself in my mood of emotional doubts and longings. You were right not to have any patience with that. 

But were you right after all? Perhaps some blind force of avoidance pushed you away from me, almost without you being conscious of it. I am not like you. I am dragged right into the whirlpool of emotions until everything just blows out of proportion. 

But there are entire months, when I don't think of you. And then it just comes back. I remember you being frustrated but beautiful (so beautiful), and I remember you being rather serene and looking back at me as if you don't remember me very well. 

One question still remains. What have I done? But really, what? What have I done to you to make you act the way you did. Nothing. And yet, I know the answer. You just did not like me, plainly did not. Well, most people don't or don't take notice of me at all, so why did you have to be any different. 

I can forgive but I cannot forget. If only you just realized what you did. Then I'd be at peace. You were right not to give me your heart. I would accept it fully and then slowly distance myself from you, when the time would come. But you wouldn't even notice. I would never cut it so abruptly. 

Most of all, I miss being the compassionate one. If only I had you turning to me when things are not going your way. Not that I would not be happy, when everything is well. Quite the opposite, there are so many words of praise I never said to you. You never had a loser attitude, I liked that a lot about you. 

It's inevitable to idealize you,  in the absence of any meaningful connection between you and me. Why does not anyone come to blur the memory of you? But I don't really care about others. They are all pale shadows, but still rather bright, compared to me -- the greyest shadow, or just plain transparent. No, I don't really care about anyone. 

Sometimes it made me a bit impatient how you seemed to never see something about myself that seemed obvious to me or hear what I was saying. At other times, you knew me so clearly, in a few words, without giving it much thought, you summarized my problem, myself and my life. 

The mornings are frosty for you and the sky is high up and blue; and we wear scarves and jackets, when you would sunbathe in short-sleeved shirts. I don't miss you but if you suddenly said you did, I'd have to put my hand over my mouth not to scream that I love you.

A scorpion and a frog meet on the bank of a stream and the scorpion asks the frog to carry him across on its back.  The frog says, ""How do I know you won't sting me?"" The scorpion replies, ""Because if I do, we will both die."" Conceding the point, the frog takes the scorpion on his back, but half way across the river, the scorpion strikes.  As the frog begins to die, he asks, ""Why?"" The scorpion replies, ""It's my nature.""


**The morale of the story is that we cannot change who or what we are, even if it kills us.**


I’m hoping you are in fact, not the scorpion in your own tale. I want to believe you can change your stripes and fully embrace a metamorphosis towards *good*, letting the self-destruction cease indefinitely. I’m comforted thinking about you at your most authentic self, ignoring the naysayers, and doing what makes *you* happy and fulfilled.


But if you are inept of change, only going through the motions of what *should* be done…I don’t know how to process or accept that. 


Keeping with the animal analogies, I refuse to be your *Great White Buffalo*.  Can’t I just be your friend that was there along the way, indirectly guiding you towards this path of virtue?

You are sober. I’m proud of you. You’ve done this alone, and you’ve done well. 

You have your lawyer filing your divorce next week. Good. Why you’ve let her walk all over you for so long is something we need to face sooner than later, but you are heading in the right direction. 

You’ve been doing really well with work. Pushing forward and taking care of what needs to be done despite the difficulties. 

You are doing well with your son. Keep doing what you are doing with him. You no longer need to fear that you will be like your father. You just aren’t.

OK so on to the fun stuff.

You hate where you live. Relax. It’s not so bad. It may be small, but it’s what you can afford. You are just not in the position to change it right now so try and make the best of it.

Your occupation is doing you no good any longer. It was the right choice at the time, but now it is doing you more harm than good. You want to return to school, but work consumes too much of your “free” time. Find something else. You are not making the best money, and can most likely find something comparable financially, with the benefit of actual free time. 

It’s ok to be lonely. I know you struggle with it, but look at what you’ve learned from it. Things may have gotten you mixed up lately, but returning to your old distractions will not help. You know what you need now. Let yourself just be, and maybe one day you will find someone who isn’t just what you need, but needs you in the same way. 

Your depression doesn’t pass on its own. You need to eat more. Get some exercise. Feel good about yourself again. 

This is your life. No one is going to help you through it. Relying on others to do what is right is exactly how you got so messed up. You made their burdens your own and was left holding the weight. You forgive them, and continue on as you always do. I think it’s time to forgive yourself and change your direction.

You were a waiter at a resturant I went to. Ginger hair, freckled arms. You wore black slacks and a white button up shirt with the sleeves rolled up to your elbows.  You had the kindest eyes and a smile that made me melt. You were perfect and we fell in love instantly. I wish I could remember what your face looked like. Its been so long. Remember when we fell in love? It felt like an entire life passed me by. We got married. We had kids. We grew old together. What we had wasn't puppy love, or love that faded. It was that deep soul crushing love that I felt through my entire being. I never loved anyone as much as I loved you.

I remember the feeling of waking up. I felt so warm and turned to smile at you. You weren't there. That sudden realization that you weren't real, that our lifes together wasn't real, that our love wasn't real made me sob uncontrollably. I never wanted anyone/anything more in my entire life.

I've only dreamt about you twice. I don't really remember the second dream but you were a time traveler or something of that nature and you came and rescued me. There was not falling in love this time, we were already in love. I tried to dream of you as long as possible this time because I knew you'd be gone again when I woke up. And you were. I didn't sob this time, but it still made me incredibly sad the rest of the day with this pain in my chest that wouldn't go away.

I haven't dreamt of you in over a year. I miss you so much. And I know its pathetic since you arn't a real person. But love that we had felt real. You felt real. We felt real.

Sometimes I seretly hope you're my soul mate. That somewhere in the future you are there, waiting for me again.

But since I haven't dreamt of you in a long time,and you are real, am I going to the wrong path to never meet or? Or am I getting closer to you? Or maybe you just don't exsist at all.

Are you blind to everything we shared? I know it can't be because you dont feel what I do and see what I see about us. We've talked about that in depth and the fit is just there. We just are. You said yourself that he betrayed your trust and yet he gets one more chance while I get cast aside? Bullshit. Yet here I sit, surprising even you, with how calm I'm being about all this.

You're just so afraid of what the change might bring that you can't allow yourself something new. Someone new. Someone who wants nothing more than to make your happiness priority over all else.

I feel like just because it wasn't easy to actually save up for a ring, LIKE YOU WANTED TO, you just gave up on us completely. Stating I deserve better and that you have nothing to provide for me. 

Such BULL SHIT! 

I feel like I waited around and supported you for so long and nothing came of it, except a broken heart. I was so patient with you and you finally came around to certain things and you just decided to throw in the towel because it was too much work. You didn't say it but it sure feels like it. 

Now we live apart and have been broken up for 2 months after 6 years of being together 24/7.

I'm starting to feel like a little rag doll because you use and dispose of me depending on your mood.

I want to remain friends with you but you are just so freaken complicated! One minute you love me and you are working on yourself for US. The next minute you still love me but you're not in love with me and you are working on yourself for yourself. 

You block me from contacting you as if I'm the one always contacting you, but unblock me whenever you feel like you miss me and want to initiate a random conversation. I play along because I see nothing wrong in talking to you like friends, but then you flip the switch on me as if I need to be reminded that we are just friends and nothing else. I don't understand, you're the one contacting me! I don't reach out to you and I don't beg or plead to get back together or anything of that sort. 

You need to make up your mind and stop being so complicated. If you want to move on then stop contacting me! You can't have the best of both worlds and if I'm not what you want then let me move on from this stupid emotional roller-coaster that you have me on!

A bit more than that, but we will just stick with half a decade. I would have done anything to have you stick around, to see me through my recovery from the hell that was my head at that time.

But, despite all of my offerings, that is not what happened. You left me, saved my life from an accidental overdose, then prompty kicked me out of the home that we shared. I moved in with a psychopath who now hates me because he thinks I ""stole his girlfriend"" due to the fact that while I was living there, she hung out with me more than she did with him. Now, he is on a quest for revenge, with unlimited access to semi-automatic weapons. This should be nice. Considering the fact that he knows exactly where I live, I keep my weapons loaded. 

Now, I moved out of that madhouse, and into my own place in Maryland. I live by myself, for the first time in my life. Sometimes, I enjoy the solace but other times I'm terrified. I try to have visitors as much as possible so that the solitude doesn't drive me mad.

I understand that you think I am angry with you. I should be, but I am not. I understand that feelings change. As I  was falling deeper and deeper in love with you, you were falling out of love with me. It finally got to the point where a small incident that wouldn't have even fazed the us of years past tore us completely apart in the present. 

I replay that in my head every single day, and every single day it nearly kills me. I know I need to forget you, move on, etc. But you were, are, and possibly always will be the love of my life. You have damaged me to the point where I can not trust anything anyone says. I have been in the position since you left me where women told me that they loved me. In every situation, it has made me close all forms of communication. I don't know if it's that I don't believe them, but I certainly don't feel the same. I think you still hold such a large place in my heart that there isn't enough room for anyone else. 

This certainly can not be healthy for me. Especially when I hold no place in your heart. I don't know why, even after 6 months, I refuse to and can not let you go. Even after you have teased me twice by saying that we could hang out, only to cancel plans. Even after the only three times that I have seen you since were for your own selfish reasons. 

I'm not angry. I am devastated, hurt, and very upset, but not angry. I mean, we were engaged. You even said that my first proposal wasn't good enough, making me do it again. You even said my original ring was not good enough, conveniently losing it and buying yourself something nicer. I was totally ready to enter the next phase of our lives together. Apparently, you had been having your doubts for years. So, why did you say yes? If you knew the answer was no, why did you say yes......twice?

This has damaged me to the point where I don't ever think I will be able to feel ""Love"" again. It has left my heart cold. I can only hope that one day, maybe you will be able to see how much I always have loved you.

I’ve been wondering a lot about a lot of things lately. I’m still stumbling around the place, trying to find my footing, trying to figure out what it is that I want to live for, the things I want to create, the person I want to be, the person I am…

I’m always in conflict with myself. I tell myself that every minute of time given to me is an absolute blessing and that I cant spend a minute doing whatever I want to. but recently, I’ve been wasting too much of that on sleeping, on eating, on pointless daydreaming that serves no purpose other than to distract me from the work I have to do.

And with all these extraneous things clouding my thoughts, some things seem to be in place. My love for music. How a good, happy movie makes everything feel alright. That feeling I get when I know that I’ve done something right. That rare moment when I finish something I’ve been working on like a drawing, and I actually like it.

But a particular constant in my head have led my thoughts back to a few months ago. Back to those wandering conversations where it felt like a whole world opened up and I felt at peace with everything-when even the most careless, pointless comment would find its little significance, while the heavier, darker thoughts were dwarfed by the vastness of the universe, of the possibilities that I realized was out there. The warmth I felt when I realized that for once in my life, I can be exactly as I am. That I can tear off this mask that I’ve been forced to show others and reveal to someone else the raw form of who I am.

And it was in these moments that I shared with you that I finally felt at peace with who I was. And I miss that. I miss you. I don’t know if you check this blog anymore, but if you do, I want you to know that you mean so much to me. and I don’t want this to just disappear the way things do when they fade with time. But I don’t want to steer you off course, if you’re trying to look for your own path. I’m just guessing that by the time you remember this and read back on these entries again, things would be clearer and simpler for both of us. I’m sorry I couldn’t do anything to help you feel better. But I guess finding answers is a task that should be done alone..

I don’t know why it has occurred to me so late that in those few months that we got to know each other, you filled such a huge gap in my life. I don’t even know the exact point when I realized. Maybe it was when I realized that my playlist is still full of the songs and artists that you recommended to me. Maybe it was when I finished reading The Little Prince for the third time in a week. Maybe it was when a few weeks ago my friend played Falling Slowly on her itunes and for some reason, I felt my heart break a little.

You know when I said I hope we still know each other in a few years? I meant it. You know, like, seriously. And stuff. And when you said that we'll *always* know each other, I, like, totally appreciated that.

Words like *'always'* and *'forever'* tend to leave a taste in my mouth that won't go away. The eternal is a scary thing. I think that's why religion is so popular. But it's okay, I know you only mean it for the next 50-60 years in which we're statistically likely to be alive.

If 'knowing each other' means more than just 'being Facebook friends and occasionally throwing a few 'likes' back and forth', that'd be good. If it means living on different ends of the continent, I want to Skype you frequently. I don't want to hold you to any kind of commitment, I just want to make it clear that whether or not we're a couple, I always want to be your friend.

I was stupid to think I could move on so quickly. Really I was just covering up my emotions with a distraction. It didn't work. I broke down. I realized what I was doing. I ended it. Tried to get back with you. And you said no. 

Worst day of my life.

I love you. More than anyone. More than anything. I feel so empty now. I feel alone. I feel like I no longer have a purpose. I feel like I just pass through each day, only half of myself aware. I want you back. And you said no.

Our break up was mutual more or less. We came to the agreement at the end of the horrible conversation. But I had legit reasons, and I'm glad you actually came out and said them to me in your email. I think that's what sucks the most. Because you get it now. 

But you said you couldn't change now or maybe ever. You said you couldn't give me the love, compassion, communication, and sentimentality that I need and that it wouldn't be fair for either of us at this point. And maybe you're right. But to be completely honest, I don't want the same things I wanted before. For a minute, I was ""with"" a guy that ideally would be the perfect boyfriend. He wanted to take me shopping, he wanted and did go all out on Valentines day, he was cute and cuddly acting, he was sentimental, he was everything that you are not. And after half of month of that, I realized that I didn't want all of that, despite what I thought before. 

Truth is, I want you. All of you. The good and the bad. The nice you and the jerk you. 

I had this realization about what was truly important to me. It's not the sentimental crap. It's not the cute texts. It's not all the stuff I wanted before. No. It's you. Everything about you. The good and the bad. Our similarities and our differences. 

I don't care about before. I don't care about what I wanted before. That's changed. I want to make things work for us. It's like we have both said, relationships are give and take. Being with you would mean there are things that I would have to give up, things that you as a person are not capable of giving. I know this now and I'm okay with it. Those things are no longer important. 

It still bothers me that you told me that I deserve someone better than you. It also bothers me that you told me that maybe with a little more life experience we can make things work down the road. First of all, I don't want ""someone better."" I want you. Second of all, I want to experience life with you, not separate. I want to grow with you. I still want a future with you.

Let's be real here... you're not going to change. Frankly I'm not even sure why you said that. You're stuck in your ways. If you weren't, we wouldn't have broken up. I know this. You know this. So why say things might be different in the future because maybe you'll change?

You said when you're finished with school, maybe we can try again. That's three fucking years away. That thought makes me sick. Sooooo many things can happen in that span of time. You may get a girlfriend. And then I'm out of luck for good.

I don't really think you understand why I am so upset. I've been through quite a few relationships. I have always been the one to break them off and not once did I cry over them because I actually loved and missed them. Until you came along. Granted it took almost a month for it to hit me, but I'm a mess now. I cried every time I had to leave to go home from seeing you, I cried every time I sent you off, I cried at the thought of losing you, I cried for things I never cried for over anyone. Usually when I'm done with a person, I'm done with them for good. The day we break up is the last day I ever speak or see them again. But I came back wanting a second chance. That's a big deal for me. Having that realization of, holy shit I actually love this guy, like real love, like love I can't live without, is a huge fucking deal for me.

I don't want to share my life with anyone else. I don't want to be with anyone else. I don't want to take care of anyone else. I don't want to love anyone else. I don't want to be happy with anyone else. I don't want to miss anyone else. I don't want to fight with anyone else. I don't want to fuck anyone else. I don't want to become comfortable with anyone else. I don't want anyone else but you.

I have felt so empty since all of this. I have felt like a shell of myself, smiling and functioning on the outside but completely empty and lost on the inside. Are you feeling the same way? I wish I knew.

I wish I could tell you all of this, but I've already said enough as it is. I'm doing my damn hardest to not cross over the crazy ex girlfriend line and blow up your phone and email. It's really hard to just sit here and not fight for this. But I know you're not going to budge. You're going to fill your brain with logic and reason and block out everything else. 

&gt; I love you.  As a friend, and a person.  You're one of my favorite people ever, and you deserve to be happy.  

How much though? Do you still love me like before? I wish I knew.... And maybe I do deserve to be happy, but I don't want to move on. I don't want to be happy with anyone else. I wish you could feel how I feel. This is by far the worse pain I've ever felt. You think I'm miserable... but you really have no idea. This is enough for me to call it quits on relationships forever.

You're about to graduate and there's a pretty little blonde girl you're going about to interview for a position at the Kernel. You're going to hire her then you guys are going to have a 5-hour long Facebook conversation that ends with exchanging numbers. Then you're going to invite her over to your house where you hit it off, play cards, and you finally get the nerve up to make a move on a girl. It works out man, trust me.

This is where we go off track. You know how you're thinkin' about going to law school? Don't. Fucking. Do it. You know how you're starting to think your drinking is getting a little out of hand? If you go to law school, you'll be a full blown alcoholic in three years. And listen up, that's important coming up. You won't get a job and you'll be an unpaid slave in $60,000 worth of debt. You'll wake up wanting to kill yourself and blaming your sadness on other people. You start to ruin your family. You lose friends. You wind up sitting alone in an apartment with the love of your life 50 feet away and she doesn't want to talk to you.

You know that girl we were talking about? Cherish her. Love her. She's the best thing that ever happened to you and you're going to blow it with alcohol and other women. You know how I know that? You're fucking depressed. Don't shake your fucking head like that. You know that's why things didn't work out with Cloe. You know that's why you have a shit relationship with Megan. Maybe they weren't worth it, but I can guarantee this one is. She's unbelievably gorgeous, she's going to love you to death, she's smart, funny, and thinks the world of you.

Oh, and she's an unbelievable mom. Yeah, let that sink in. You're going to be a dad. And don't get all scared, because you can do it, man. She's the smartest, most beautiful thing you'll ever see. And she'll be smarter than you ever thought about being.  And that girl? yeah, she's even prettier after she gives you the gift of a daughter. 

Remember how we were talking about alcohol and depression? Yeah, go to a doctor tomorrow. Then buy her something special that you can give her when she brings you cookies in the basement of the Kernel. Or when she makes you a CD that you listen to over and over. Or maybe when she just smiles. She deserves it. And I know this isn't going to be easy, but you've got the best girl in the world there. It's okay if you screw up because she's going to give you more chances and more of her life than you could ever dream. 

And when other girls present themselves in your life? Tell them to go fuck themselves. You're about to have the only two girls you'll ever need. Focus on your career. Focus on yourself. Don't screw this up.

So three things: 1) Don't go to law school; 2) Go to the doctor; and 3) Get your head out of your selfish ass and love this girl forever.

I wonder if we would've gotten along as well as we do now, or would our little inside jokes and running conversation trends have evaporated in this alternate world? Or are we alike in that aspect as well, the age difference being just another pesky little triviality that establishes us into two different people (much like our differences in opinion regarding Let the Right One In and its American counterpart). This is one of those times where I wish I could read your mind, but then the surprise would be ruined.

Sometimes if I close my eyes hard enough, I can conjure you up, down to the smallest detail - your brown eyes with those flecks of green (reminiscent of mossy trees), your long eyelashes, your nose with its funky ridge, that little freckle behind your left ear - and all it takes is a bit of wishful thinking to wrap my arms around you and press my face into your neck. To catch your scent, or feel the warmth of your body, your fingertips brushing against my skin. Sometimes - when I'm feeling brave - I imagine pressing my lips against yours, the thought of kissing you even for a second leaving me breathless and dizzy.

Sometimes I forget that you should be unobtainable. And then I remember that I'm too stubborn to just drop it (what kind of hopeless romantic would I be?). After all, you've become a daily necessity of mine.
Sometimes I get hung up on the trivial things that I don't know about you. Like how much chest hair you have, or what kind of underwear you might be wearing. Sometimes I let my mind wander to southern proportions, but my glasses fog up and I have to start all over again. I'll admit it; you've become my favorite masturbatory fantasy.

Sometimes I stare at your butt for extended periods of time when I'm walking behind you. 

Sometimes you slip up, and say the most perfectly wrong things that make me think that this thing isn't so one sided after all. Or I'll catch you staring long after we've said adieu. Sometimes your hands brush mine on our more mobile conversations. Bonnie Raitt said it best. ""We stand just a little too close. We stare just a little too long."" Sometimes we just smile at each other long after the conversation is over, and I want to throw myself at you. Other times, you worry about me too much, but the concern really is touching. 

Sometimes there just isn't enough space to write down how greatly you've affected me. And forever would not be long enough to actually tell you.

I'm completely and utterly smitten with you, sir. And sometimes I think you know it.

But then one night you said you loved me too. I never expected to hear you say that. I was not prepared for the emotions that caused. We had never actually met and you lived 1800 miles away in another country. I was more than happy to be your friend, your confidant. I never expected more.   

But when you said you loved me it did change things. I looked forward even more to the time we spent chatting and we did spend a lot of time doing that. Even if it was just for a few minutes every day I grew accustomed to always ""seeing"" you every day. And then you got back with your ex. It seemed my doubts about your love were true, or at the least that love meant different things to us both.  It's not that you are back with your ex that's the problem. It's that we have gone from feast to famine for me.

You said we would still be friends that I meant more to you than I knew. But your bf was getting the password to your fb account so I had to be ""careful"" about what I said there.  

And that's where it gets rough. I see you online now more than ever before, but you hardly ever talk to me now. And I cannot talk properly with you because your bf might see and get jealous even if it's innocuous. And I never know when I see you online is it you or is it him? I can't like your posts, I can't comment on them. It's so frustrating!  

I am beginning to think that it might be better to stop being friends. Honestly I think it would be easier for me not to see you at all than to see you and not have you talk to me. And it fucking sucks so much that I cannot fucking just talk with you about all this because your bf might see and get offended AND you never have time for me anymore. I get you're busy but would it really be such a big deal to spend some time with me?   

It was so much easier to just be your friend, going back to that after you said you loved me would be tolerable if you just spent some time talking like we used to! Hell if you even spoke to me for more than 30 seconds in a week. I feel like I am trapped in Hell. I can see you there but I cannot talk to you and you will not or cannot talk to me.  

I honestly don't know how to handle this. I am beginning to resent you and I don't want to do that. Blanking you and removing you from my friends seems the cowardly thing to do.

I HATE THIS AND HOW IT MAKES ME FEEL!

You never knew what it took from me to finally ask you out. You never realized I knew you'd been sleeping with him for over a year then. You never realized how much it hurt when people told me about meeting you at a party the night I was in the ER.

This isn't easy to say or type or...whatever.

	
I can't do this....I know I said I'd try....but this is different. Its not just    her.....I imagine its never been 
just her. I told you before that I never got jealous    of women because they never presented themselves to you in this way before. I  can't do this because I can't keep hoping that I'll be ok one day, cause I'm  not....and I don't see myself being ok anytime soon. It doesn't matter that its her,  it could be any other person and I'd still feel hurt. You can move on with this new  person to help you out. I'm on my own here. And thats how its got to be. I've been  on my own for most of my life and its gotta happen again I suppose. Right now you  keep going back and forth between us and you try to make it seem as though that  should be enough. I'm sorry but its not. Let me tell you something, If you were  sick...or hurt in any way and you needed me...I would have been there. I'd have  dropped all else to be there for you. You have shown twice in 3 days that you won't do the same. You left with her that first day I was sick. Then you do the same today. I would have been at your bed side the entire time, like I have in the past. I wouldn't have gone off with someone else or hell I wouldn't have even thought about myself getting sick because I was taking care of you. I would be there for you.....and its clear time and time again you won't be there for me unless its absolutely dire....and that difference is what makes for a best friend. You throw around these words like you know what they mean. I've been a “best friend” and believe me.....from what you've told me and from what I've seen, you haven't. I can't have half hearted best friends or even friends in my life now. In the past 3 days, I've seen you a total of about 3-4 hours. I bet you spent more time than that with her that first day I was sick. You might have been here yesterday, but you opted to stay away for your own safety. It may be a change that's so subtle that you'll deny it, claim that its not even there, but I'll see it, just like I saw something between you too(remember how you denied that). You'll ignore it and be angry with me or call me dumb or crazy. Then it'll happen more, which you'll deny/ignore because its become the norm to you, then this process will continue until you either only text me or call me occasionally(kinda like Matt) and we'll maybe get together once every few months or I get ignored almost completely. You say to give you the chance to show me different.....I've been sick for 3 days.....and seen you much less that she has. You might have argued most of it.....but you were together, you chose to go with her. And like I started with, its not about her.....all of those “hers” in this message could be “hims” or a completely different “her”, doesn't matter, would still be the same situation. 
	Look, the biggest part of all of this is that you've moved on. I can't handle that, I just can't. I love you with every bit of my soul and to know that you've chosen to tell someone else that you love them in that way makes me feel like I've been had my heart torn out while its still beating. Its that fact that kills me but its also the one that makes this decision for me. Whats done is done and we can't go back. I can't pal around and try to be friends while I still love you, I just can't. It hurts too damn much. I die a little inside when you call me baby. I know you've called her that. Whenever you want to hold hands or even sit on the couch together like last night.....It just stabs at me inside in a way you can't possibly understand.
	Now please understand that I'm not saying these things out of anger....I'm crying as I type this.....I don't want to let you go, but I also don't want to feel this way anymore. You moved on to someone else so very quickly and left me in the dust that I don't know which way to turn. Don't get me wrong, I still hold plenty of resentment for the things you've done, but that is not what this is about, its about me,  taking care of me. And with you in my life.....I can't do that and I won't be ok.

I have you to thank for everything wonderful so far. I also wish for more great things to come. Now would have to be the best time to give warning, even though I've already expressed it numerously.

I hope you understand well that I have a lot of emotional baggage. Most of it unneccessary as you would say, and a great deal of me. I am proud to say that you are one of very few people to see me in raw form as a person, but also one of the few that I fear most in disappointing. It is here now that I best say that from hereon that your life's journey with me in the picture will never be the same. Just like how you have become entangled in mine.

I am a doom not to be taken lightly. I will never be able to give you anything much in return for all you've done for me, but what I can give you is the permission to take what is left of the being known as me. Whatever was left from the wreck I must call my own life's pathetic journey.

I know, you're gonna tell me I'm not pathetic, and you know what? You're right, I'm not. I am simply a scared little one on the inside, a valiant noble who knows no bounds except in the face of danger, whatever that may be. A small speck of dust and carbon on this mysterious little planet.

Alien is what I really am. Alien to the customs of reality, abnormality and society. I guess, what I'm basically trying to say is that I'm just really strange and really stupid, even for someone of my caliber.

Please, do not mistake and think it ""melancholy"" or other choice words. Think it best as me being a me I should have never shown you, and will try my best not to show ever again. As much as I love and am grateful to have you in my life and be proud to be your girlfriend, what I am not proud of is making you sad with worry when you do not have to. So, from hereon even when I am troubled I will finally take up the rite of adulthood and admit it- I need to take responsibility for my actions. Even if it means hiding my pains and worries from you. Because no one but myself should have to deal with the things that go on in my life. No one should have to ever listen to me complain ever again. My opinion is useless, much like how I am except in times of need. I will finally admit it, I'm growing up. And while I would probably say that I do not like it one bit, I will not tell you this in person for reasons stated above. Circular? Probably.

My life is a drama, and sadly there is no escape for you out of it. I look back fondly of the 23 of December 2012, the day we mutually agreed (you asking me out) to join together as a couple.

To be honest, I don't think I've even tried to really get over you. Sure, I've stopped thinking about you as much and the pain has dwindled with time. I know how you must look at me now, I must look so pitiful to you. Your loser ex boyfriend who can't get over you...I doubt you even know. You're too happy with your life. You've got a great future ahead of you. 

I think about calling you every day, but I don't. I just sit here, wallowing in my own misery. I wish you could know exactly how much of a mess I am without you in my life. You were my best friend. You always were, from the second I first started texting you, to the second I first laid eyes on you, to the very second that you crushed me. That's the problem I think. I wouldn't ever date you again, there's too many conflicting emotions for that, I just want my best friend back.

I have a story to tell you. One time, a few months ago, I had some magic mushrooms. I had the most eye opening experience of my life. I was looking at some horses in the field next to my friends house and I watched my life play back before my eyes. My entire life. When I snapped back to reality I cried. The memories that I relived were so amazing and so devastating. Especially the parts with you, those are the only parts I truly cared enough to remember. 

I'm finally starting to look at other women. Starting to think about a future without you. It's taken me a while I know, but I wanted you to know that I'm getting better.

I do not know what caused us to stop being friends but I’m willing to apologize anyway. I know I should have spoken to you sooner and sorted everything out – you are quite stubborn and never like to do the talking first – but  it's been almost two years and probably far too late now.

I miss you so much and I want to fix everything. The problem is even if we sort out our differences, I’m afraid we will never be close as we were before. I fear there will be an unspoken awkwardness between us.

This saddens me very much as I know there will never be anyone else I can have an intelligent conversation with and I will be left comparing everyone to you. However, I feel it would be greedy of me to ask for another chance to be friends and I don’t want to make you unhappy. 

I am grateful for the time we were friends. You made me a better person and opened my mind up to many new things such as your type of music and you turned me into a grammar nazi, which is something I’ve always admired about you. You are kind and honest and you’re still one of the very few people I trust completely. 

You always made time for me and never judged me. You were funny and full of ideas and ambition which is something I've always respected about you. Even when you were rejected from your dream university, you never gave up and this inspired me to have the same attitude.

I want you to know that you are already perfect and that you shouldn't change for anyone. I will always be around for you if you ever need someone to talk to and I will never ever forget or stop thinking about you.

**one** it was starting to get cold. The sun was setting. We were talking casually. I was straddling you speaking with my hands. You grabbed my wrists and pushed me back so that the sunlight hit my face. You kissed me while I was in mid-sentence. You put your hands on my face and then quietly said ""continue"". 



**two**  receipt of the first haiku. I said to myself ""*this*. This is good. This guy is good"" my first wall went down. 



**three**  the debut of the ""you are so lovely"" clips. Such sincerity with just a touch of sass. 



**four** turning down the music, buckling my seatbelt as I'm about to drive away. As I'm really bout to leave you. You closed my door and tapped it. You dropped your head. I stopped breathing. I unbuckled, hurdled out of my car and jumped in your arms. 


**five** the first time I heard her tell you she loved you. 


**six** walking into the bathroom at trivia and discovering the bruise on my neck. I absolutely panicked. I felt sick. I felt guilty. 


**seven** When I reached the ceiling. It was the most tragic ecstasy. My only response were tears. 


**eight** Judge Ashe, Rebel, and biscuits tales. 

**nine** ""constant conversations"" played at the passion pit concert. I left my group. I closed my eyes. It was the only time I can remember praying as an adult. 


**ten** yo-yo. Sixish weeks in. I knew I didn't want to lose you. I knew I couldn't have you. I lied and said I'd honor an ""expiration date"" with puerile expectations. 


**eleven** the weekend we took a break. I kept a time stamped  diary entry that i never shared. The very first thing I wrote down was this "" I don't like participating in a world where I can't share my experiences with you. I'm going to pout today. I won't be productive. I know it's irrational. It's not healthy. I don't really care. What is this proving? We aren't talking  by I'm still consumed with thoughts of you. I am possessed even without you present.

**One. Meeting You.**

""I have everyone at this party figured out, but you."" Chocolate brown eyes trained on me from the chair a few feet away. I hadn't been listening to what he'd been saying to whomever was listening, but he had my attention. Strange-looking guy. Cocky.
""Me? Oh, I'm just an observer."" I said quietly. A game.
""Bullshit. Josh over there is an observer."" He gestured to Josh, who was sitting, silently, too-drunk, tight-chested on the couch between Meaghan and James. Meaghan and James were talking animatedly, drunkenly - lewdly. Swapping sexual war stories like you might see a bunch of old veterans do down at the local street café and bar - their Acapulco shirts fluttering about in the breeze generated by the hot air and howls of laughter emanating from their mouths. Red-faced, shameless, foul. Fun.
""Oh,"" an eyebrow quirk, ""I see. Well, what am I, then?"" I did my best to be inscrutable; put on a Mona Lisa smile, peeked out from under my bangs, unblinking. At the time, I didn't know what this looked like - I just knew I was being coy. Months later, he'd tell me the effect made my eyes ""happier... no, sultry, if you prefer."" Still later, ""bedroom eyes.""
""I haven't figured you out yet."" He was a little drunk, waggled his finger at me gently, always staring me down. ""...but I will."" A pirate smile. Not strange-looking. Interesting.
I smirked a sigh, and still keeping eye-contact, half-stood, leaned over to him, and whispered very quietly in his ear: ""I see you -- you're a bad person. But that's ok... I am, too.""


Strangely beautiful - not as I remembered him from the first day, at orientation. He was then conventionally handsome; sat beside me, laughed a lot at my meaningless nervous banter, and then he was gone. Like a figment of my imagination. ""I thought I'd imagined you"" we both said to each other that January.

And that's how it began. ""Strange"" as we both were - are. Strange as we continue to be - together, a perfect binary.

Still later:

""That's what this is, you know."" We were sitting in a cafeteria, drinking coffee, leaning into the table, saying terrible things, gauging the other's reactions.
""What's what?"" Eyes always locked. Our conversations important.
""Folie à deux.""
""What?""
""Insanity of two. Two people sharing the same delusions or hallucinations, in synchronicity.""
""Oh... I don't know about that.""
""Then what?""
""We're the same person, don't you know that?""
""Maybe binary?"" I hadn't said it out loud before.
""Maybe. I think we're the same, though. Except that you're nicer... and I'm clearly better-looking.""
""Oh, how humble of you.""
""You make up the humility.""
""Of course. Folie à deux... we make up for one another.


**Two. Open Letter.**

Dear Teal Wonder:

Why can't you seem to notice that I think you're wonderful?

I see your faults, I acknowledge them, but I don't care. You're stubborn, often conceited, argumentative, reactionary, insane. You hold a grudge, smoke, bite your nails. You probably don't shave often enough - you're scruffy-looking. You are mean unnecessarily, but I think it's because you don't think you deserve to be cared for. I think you're so afraid of people rejecting you that when they get close you start to try to push them away.

I don't care that you're like this. I can't fix you, but I can live with these things, because your qualities outweigh these human faults.

I don't care that you're physically imperfect in those ways you jokingly shrug off because you're self-conscious. It doesn't matter that you walk with a subtle limp that you hate and are embarrassed of; or that your one cheekbone is a little higher than the other because of a fight you got into in high school. I don't care if you're super-skinny because you stress to the point where you can't eat; I don't care that you drink too much coffee, or get cranky when you're busy or tired or hungry. I don't care that you look very young when you shave - I hate that you feel like you need to hide behind your beard. I suspect, for all your bravado, you aren't comfortable in your own skin. Can't you see you're handsome? Can't you see you're beautiful? 

It breaks my heart a little every time you tell me you think you're stupid; you're ugly; you're undesirable; that you'll die alone. That you automatically assume I'll reject you. I only say ""no"" because morally it's the right thing to say to someone who has a girlfriend he hardly sees, hardly talks to, hardly talks about. But she exists. If she didn't exist, I'd be the first person in line. Sometimes, you're exasperatingly idiotic. (I am too, though, so that's ok.)

Why can't you see that you aren't going to chase me away? Your jabs are insincere, testing the water. But we connect better than most, and I'm not going to just throw that away because you're afraid of me, afraid I already make you happy, and will probably continue to make you happy. I'm afraid of being happy, too, but I won't let myself fuck this up; we need to know each other. Can't you see that? Of course you can, you just haven't admitted it to yourself yet.

Why can't you just let me need you, and admit that you need me, too? I don't have romantic expectations; I'm just talking about basic human connection.


I think you're amazing just the way you are -- to the point where it takes my breath away that you can't see what I see when I look at you, and talk to you.


**Three. 3 AM text messages.**

""Your eyes glisten with the tears of Khruschev, who wanted to hurl all the women to space. Your hips sway like the ships of Persia, turned into bridges to hasten defeat. Your mouth is the heart of the prison of Sisyphus, who only pushes to pass the time. Your hand is firm, like that of Atilla, who would have painted the canvas of others. Your womb, the oven of Alexander VI, producing sweet bastards to shake the earth. Your feet are the faces of twice dead Jesus, he's coming back to find his wallet. Your neck supports the weight of Atlas, with none of its use and all of its dangers. Your belt is become the wall of Hadrian, save that it stops the southward invasion. Your heart is the seat of animal secrets, don't tell Harvey or he'll cut you alive. Your face is the place that forces dreams to sleep. One day Cayce will wake you to party with Nostradamus.' It's the closest thing to a panegyric you'll ever receive. Cherish it.""


**Four. Gentle Co-dependence.**

""Where are we getting supper?""
""Where would you like to go?""
""...We are getting supper, right?""
""I presume so.""
""[laughing]...We need to stop assuming each other's company. Oh dear god."" 


**Five. Serious Co-dependence.**

He pointed out a small advertisement in one of the local newspapers (low-budge') today, offering classes on learning how to develop healthy relationships: ""Codependents Anonymous.""

We looked at each other over S. and C., as we sat there for hours and hours in the University Hospital waiting room, and laughed and just looked at each other.

S. and C. wanted to know what we were laughing about. We told them. They said, ""don't you need to be in a relationship to be codependent?""
I looked at him, and he looked at me, and he said, ""What you don't seem to understand is that I've been trying to take our relationship to the next level for months and months, but she just keeps friend-zoning me, man. But I'm persistent; I mean, just look at her. She's beautiful. Sometimes, when I look at her, I get that raw, dull ache in the bottom of my heart. I just want her so bad."" And I know he's being ludicrous for the sake of being ludicrous, especially because of his grand-standing streak and his theatrical tone, but the best lies have truth in them. Especially when we just stare into each other's eyes from across rooms as often as we do, and it's pretty electric, and we know what the other's thinking. 


**Six. Conflicting messages.**

**A:** 

""Then why are you people here?""
""What do you mean 'you people'?""
""I love you?""
""I know.""
""Yeah. Yeah.""
""Sure, sure.""
""You're the sister I never wanted.""
""I'm acutely aware. Though I would hope you wouldn't talk to your sister in the same manner.""
""...Well said."" 

**B:**

""He's a professor at the Centre for Medieval Studies at [university].""
""Ah. I almost went there for undergrad.""
""You should've.""
""Why?""
""We could've met, had great sex. I could've avoided several terrible relationships.""
""Maybe. But I'm not Asian, and you prefer Asian women as a rule.""
""It was before I took a fancy to that category of the female population. It could've worked.""


**Seven. Leaving.**

""We're soul-mates. Two sides of the same coin. Don't you know that?""

""I want us to be eccentric old people; penpals for which the transatlantic postal system is obliged to stay open."" 


**Eight. The last time, really.**

We went to a yuppie restaurant, because we never had before.

We had a 3-course meal. I had steak (was impressed with it, which is a rare sentiment for me to have in a restaurant) he had what was apparently a very nice pork loin. I wore my (and his) favourite dress, he wore an adorable sports coat. We joked about marriage, about knowing each other when we're elderly. We made plans; to see each other one last time before I move to England, regardless of whether or not the cottage plans he has with me are viable.

""I like it when older people get stuck fashion-wise, and manners-wise in the decade in which they flourished. I think we should be falsely nostalgic -- all of the time. I'll wear suits, and a fedora. You'll wear evening gowns - mostly only in midnight blue. We'll behave as though we don't understand this isn't normal.""
""Yes, we'll live like we're constantly under the impression that we're being secretly filmed for a film noir. It'll be the 'The Big Sleep' or 'Strangers on a Train.' And when we get too senile, we'll forget that we're pretending. Everyone around us will notice the other has gone a little funny; one of us will be the last to find out. We'll keep insisting of the other, 'nah, they're fine; they're just being themselves.'""
""Yes. 'Come back next week; we're in character. Don't you know?'""

He fed me some of his soup, because he knows it makes me uncomfortable, but I'm too polite to refuse. So I gave him the evil eye while eating the soup off his spoon.

He paid for my supper; that made me uncomfortable, too, because I don't like burdening anyone, though it was sweet. We sat in the window for the meal. We got smiles from older couples who walked by.

""What are we doing now?""
""We could always have a shotgun wedding.""
""I'm not pregnant.""
""We can fix that...? *deliberately creepy wink*""
""You're ridiculous.""

We got coffee; I only got an espresso. It was an excuse to prolong the hangout. We both knew it.

""What am I going to do without you around? Maybe I'll make you my muse. I'll muse upon you, and then I can make art. Because, you know, I have to eat... even if I can't actually do art, per se.""
""You could very well do that.""



I keep joking, lately: ""Twenty-two days!"" ""Twenty-one days!"" And every time I say this, he looks so, so sad. So, so hurt. He bends his face down, and looks up at me, sideways, like a sad puppy. I told him, ""I only joke because I'm sad."" He said, ""I know. You're the other half to my soul. I'm sad you're going, too... Maybe by the time you get back for Christmas, I'll be able to deadpan properly when talking to you, though. That would be funnier than me laughing every time you look at me, or speak to me and catch me out in my bullshit -- as it is now.""

I'll never forget how you idly played with the the nail on my right right finger as you held my hand and stared into my eyes with the saddest of looks.


**Nine. Now.**


You're an idiot.


I'm an idiot.


We're really both idiots.



It's all so magnetic. Don't you feel it? Of course you do. I know you do. You told me so. We're just in semi-denial. You told me you'd be there on Monday. ""How could I not be?"" And then you said something jokey, and hokey likening me to some ring from some high fantasy novel. You said I beckon like that.


It seems we both feel the pull all the time. It's unproductive. It's there.


I was trying to convince you to work hard to get the two dates we settled on free. I know you're studying for an LSAT rewrite, but I don't care. I know you don't care either, you're just doing this for your parents. And that hurts me, because I can feel your soul ache about it from here. You don't want to be a lawyer. But your parents want you to. And you don't want to be a failure in their eyes.

You said, ""I'll aim for two, promise one.""
""Ok. Stress that I am important and won't be around for 'like' a year.""
""They know you're important.""
""Do they?"" I really wish I knew what you said about me to them. It's a passive gnawing curiosity.
""Yes.""
""Good."" Then, ""I would've been disappointed otherwise.""

I was the senior on the way out the door and you were the freshman seeing something new but already we could all see you knew who you were and against all that stubbornness you were amazing.  Another life and you might have been compared to a one dimensional California girl, but to me you were funny and serious, sad and happy, scared and proud, and so much more.

I imagine the only reason we ever talked was because I had been friends with your cousin the year before.  I was thankful every day I had that ice breaker to start a conversation with you and eventually ask you out to see a movie together.  Of course I was too afraid to ever do anything or let you know how I really felt.  You were everything I wish I could have been and everything I ever wanted in a girl.  

We drifted apart immediately the day I moved away.  I was too scared to see what was in front of me those days and how much I should fought for something.  We started talking again years later but by that time it was as old acquaintances, not friends.  I resent all those years where I could have done something and didn't.

Years have passed since we've last seen each other and every girl I have ever known has been compared to you. None of them have gotten close to being what you could have been.  You were the girl that made me want to go to school.  You were the girl that almost had me out of my self imposed shell.  You were the extrovert saving the introvert.  My best friend.

I don't think I really loved you, even though I did say it eventually. But I did love dating you. 
I looked forward to seeing you. I loved burgers on Tuesdays and wine on the roof. And you were the best I've ever had in bed ;) . 

More than all of that I miss having you as my friend. 

I don't regret that I left. We didn't have a future together... I'm sorry but we really didn't. Our dreams are so different. We had an expiration date. We both knew it. 

If I could go back, I would have handled it better. Although I'm not sure it would have made a difference. I wish I understood exactly how it ended so badly... no one cheated... no one lied... I know you aren't the 'friends with your ex' type, but I wish you didn't hate me. Or, I wish I understood why exactly you do. 

I know it's silly and pointless but I think about you. If I could be crawling into bed with you right now, I would be, and you'd bring me coffee in the morning :P. But I'm not willing to give up what I left for. I chose a potential future over a right-now relationship. I don't regret that part. I regret that you were the one I hurt and that you were the friend I lost.

I want you to know that you were a great boyfriend. Please don't lose that. I envy the girl who's future matches with yours. The girl who's totally and completely right for you. Whoever she turns out to be... she's a lucky girl.

She's not me though. I knew that and I still know it. 

Believe me, I played through and fantasized about the life we had planned for this year so many times. There were days I missed it. I wanted it. But those days were few. And I know I would have resented that life if I had chosen it... I would have resented you. Which probably would have been worse.

Half the time I wish we had never dated. Maybe we would still be friends. I would love that. Then again, it was such a wonderful time while it lasted... and I wouldn't change it for the world. 

I do love you... not in the way you wanted. But I want the best for you. Most days. Some days, I feel like a bitter, angry ex and I hope you're miserable... but that's normal. Most days I hope you're well. I miss making you smile. Sometimes it hurts that I don't have the power to do that anymore. Not even in the romantic sense, but in the 'bring you beer when your girlfriend breaks up' with you way. I hope someone bought you beer when we broke up. It's weird, but I'm glad you rebounded so quickly. I hope that was a good experience for you. Oddly, I actually mean that.

I hold on to the hope that we will be friends again, in the future. I know it will probably be the very distant future... but expect a call in a year or two. Maybe we could get coffee? 

Until then, good luck with everything. I hope we'll be getting that coffee in California, between your grad school classes.

I like you, I always did. The only reason I kept you away was I thought I was no good for you. I also thought we had an age gap, but I didn't know for real, and I was too afraid to find out. You were the dorky little girl, but I can never forget how great you looked in that red and black dress. That was the first time I felt attracted to you. I remember you said your mom thinks the red brings out the color in your eyes. I don't think any woman could have looked the way you did that day. We got to see each other almost every other day all this time, but we rarely spoke. But I was looking at you one day and you looked back. I still don't know what happened that day almost a year ago. It's hard for a guy like me to believe a girl like you would be into me. I always thought of you, but I could not speak to you. It would kill me every day to not respond to your long gazes. You put yourself out there so many times and I didn't say anything. I'm sorry. I wished you would stop doing this to yourself. I didn't believe our love could exist the way you did. I thought if I didn't escalate, no one would get hurt. But I feel the hurt every day. I'm sorry for all the hurt it must have caused you too.

I worked so hard at improving myself over the summer, but you were practically gone by the end. I rarely get to see you now. I was getting desperate to talk to you. I asked you out one time I was able to, maybe not through the right medium I guess, but you politely turned me down. I'm glad you don't hate me for all this. At least you don't show it. I will definitely move on someday, but you aren't a girl one can forget. I wish I had one conversation about this with you - one chance for closure. I wish I didn't have a twisted view of the world back then. I wish we had talked. You have made me a better man today, and I'll keep getting better. Please forgive me for whatever I've done. I wish I could make it right some way.

This is half letter, half confession. As you know, we have a very awkward relationship. Our discussions are alway filled with spite and sarcasm. The tension unbearable as we flirt and play. The immediate thought of repercussions if we move one step too far. Until then, I will take your stares, focusing beyond my eyes as you daydream of what could be. I see your thoughts in your eyes, blushing skin and nervous lips. Those lips. Those lips are my weakness. Not having those lips is the most unbearable part of my day. That smart mouth. The things you say to me are unfair. All I can think about as you spit your sarcasm is how I am going to punish that smart mouth. Always writing checks my rope, whip and cock intend to cash. A nice tight harness and collar should do fine but I want you to remember what you have done to me. I want my rope to bite into your pale skin. As I bend your body in ecstasy, you will be reminded. My whip will sting as your words have stung me. I want to tie those gentle hands away from your touch and defense. I want you to feel the helplessness your stares, your words...those lips have made me feel. I want to touch and tastes every portion of your body. I want you to beg for me to take you. I want to feel those words come off your lips...those lips. Then, I will take you into my arms and I will have you. I will bury myself into your body, gently pulling back your hair so that I may taste your neck. Then you will know my wants, my needs and my desires.

Today we spoke. It hurt me to hear that I have caused you pain. This was never my intention. The next time you dream, I hope it is much different.

I spent three years with you.  I supported you.  You never found a job, and I doubt whether you ever even looked at all.  You harbored resentment towards me because I ""forced"" you to leave your life in another state to be with me.  Need I remind you that you were KICKED OUT OF YOUR HOUSE, and I OFFERED YOU A PLACE TO LIVE?  I spent three years of my life working my tail off in order to provide for us.  I wouldn't have minded if I had any sort of reason to believe that you were trying to find work.  But I never got that feeling, and instead, you got angry at me because ""the man should provide, not the woman"".  It's 2012, motherfucker, I'm the woman with the job supporting us, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Unfortunately, I also had to take care of the house, do all the cooking and cleaning, while you sat on your ass and played video games all day.

Since we broke up, I've come to realize that I was in an emotionally abusive relationship.  I had problems.  We all have problems.  Anxiety and depression were mine, combined with disordered eating and a terrible self-image.  Instead of being there for me, you belittled me and told me I needed to be stronger, and only weak people have problems.  You made me feel unattractive when you wouldn't even kiss me without being asked.  You showed me no affection, and never told me you loved me (unless I said ""I love you"" first, and then you'd respond, but I never got the sense that it meant anything).  We didn't have sex for the last half of our relationship.  I tried to initiate - I bought lingerie, my hands would wander, and you always pushed me away.  I felt unattractive, unloved, and worthless.  YOU made me feel unattractive, unloved, and worthless, with your constant belittling and thinly veiled insults.

I'm in a new relationship now.  He loves me, he makes me feel beautiful and wanted, he helps me with my problems rather than pushing me away, and I do the same for him (as I tried to do for you).  We have our problems like any relationship, but instead of pushing them aside, as you always did, we work through them.  We never go to bed upset with one another, even if it means we only get two hours of sleep.  He texts me randomly throughout the day just to say hello (without expecting anything in return, unlike you, where the only text messages I ever got were you asking me to pick something up for you).

I'm glad you're gone.  You thought you had broken me.  You tested me, deliberately and maliciously.  You were rude to everyone in my life, and to me, and used the excuse of ""conducting a social experiment"" to be an asshole.  Even our mutual friends have determined that I deserve better than you.  They hate you for what you did to me.  They hate you for breaking me.  But I've put myself back together now, by leaning on the people I love for strength (something you always deemed weak).  I truly hope that you find whatever you're looking for.  I don't wish the worst upon you, because I'm above that.  Even after what you did to me, I have compassion.

I'm stronger now that you're gone.  I'm happier, I'm healthier, I wake up with a smile on my face rather than dreading the day to come.  I don't walk on eggshells anymore, because I don't have to be afraid that the smallest thing will set you off.  I am open.  I am honest.  I am compassionate.

You have been an amazing part of my life. From that first summer to the last time I saw you. I know things havent always been asx good as that first summer, but life has a weird way of working. Over the past few years, I have gotten to know you. You are one of the most beautiful people I know, inside and out. I have come to respect you and look up to you. You have shown me a great example on how to live. I havent always learned from you or even from my mistakes. Life presents us with so many distractions, so many excuses, so many influences that we are sometimes blinded from what truly matters. I have let those distractions govern and influence my life since I got caught up in living the ""fun"" life. I havent been myself very often, letting people or ideas sway me. It's odd that one of the things I love about you the most (youre ability to disregard what other's think and make a choice because that is the choice you truly believe in) is also one of the things it has taken me longest to see. I have gotten caught up in the petty things around me because I thought they would bring me happiness...youve shown me I had all I needed right in front of me. Youre always trying to tell me how great my family is or how blessed I am; and youve shown me how special you are. Im sorry I did not always listen. I am listening now. To you, to [my higher power], and to myself. My pride has been the biggest thing holding me back and it has taken me this long to realize it. You take joy in the things you accomplish because they make you happy and not because of what others think. My pride did not allow me to show you, others, or even myself what was important to me. It seems odd that I want to thank you right now but I do. I want to thank you for all the memories, all the joy youve brought me, all the experiences and adventures weve been on together, for the love youve not only shown me, but also those around you, and most of all for saving me. Youve save me from myself and I am not sure I will ever be able to thank you. I need to go back to being myself and because of you, I am working on it. I wish I could thank you for it by showing you, but sometimes life doesnt let us have what we so badly want. Ive been fighting for you _, I still am fighting for you. I hope you are fighting for me and for us; because, I am fighting you you with all my heart, thoughts and actions. I know I do not always do it the best way but I need you to know it is only because of how much I care. It has been said that the hardest part of moving forward is not looking back. When I look back and see you, it is so hard sometimes. I am always thinking of you. It is hard to move forward, but what I do know is that I want you there. You are the person hold closest to my heart. Right now, it does not seem like we are together in any way (or even will ever be together), but that does not mean you're not important to me, Ive forgotten you or that I do not love you. I love you more than I thought possible and more than I even let myself see. We may not be together, but I love you ___. Forever and always. I want the best for you and I want you to be happy. Its been hard coming to terms with this but that is more important to me than us merely being together. I am fighting to be the one who makes you happy, but you are the only one who knows who makes you happy. I hope you find a way to be happy even if it doesnt mean being with me. You are an amazing person that deserves it. No matter what happens, I still want you in my life. I know sometimes it may be hard, but youve been my best friend for a long time now. Its part of what I hate most about not being able to talk...its like I have lost my best friend. I hope we continue to be friends __ and find a way to share the joy of life together even if we arent. I know you will do great, succeeding at your goals and dreams. You are not someone to get discouraged and I know you will find a way. And when you do, I hope I can share in them with you. All of the times Ive written to you, and this time especially, I do not mean to cause you guilt, stress or anything like those. I hope you take this letter with the love I put into it and not negatively. Ive thought about everything we have ever spoken of having and I have realized all that matters is what we have now. I should have shown you that. I do not want to take pride in anything besides others. I want to learn to allow myself to take joy in what makes me happy and not in what I or others think will make me happy. I want to take both pride and joy in you being with me, whether we are together or not. I should have always. I know that now; thank you for showing me.

I miss you so fucking much it hurts. I remember most everything we did together. I have the shittiest memory these days, but I will NEVER forget what we did. 

We grew up together. We lived next to each other. You were only a little younger than I was, but then you learned how to ride a bike before me. Jokes on you, because I could use a skip-it better. 

Your mom always joked we would get married some day, we even slept together in the same bed for a few hours. We were four. I remember being tired but not wanting to go home, so you offered your race car bed and then got in to keep me warm. That nap was so...

I remember the car/town rug/playmat you had. It was the coolest thing, and we played for HOURS on that thing. You were the happiest person in the world when your mom bought you a new toy car or truck to play on it.

And then we were growing up, and your mom had to move to an apartment, since your dad left. It wasn't far, though! We still hung out ALL the time, and when winter rolled around you would trudge through the snow to come sled on the hill with me.

Then you had to move again, this time not in walking distance. We still talked on the phone, and invited each other over. You held Halloween parties, and even though I was your only female friend you always invited me. I always invited you to Easter/my birthday to search for eggs and paint them.

Then MY family moved! We were closer again! Woohoo! We got to see each other more often, and you helped me through a rough patch. But then you went to a different school. But no problem, you made sure to ask for my help on projects, and listen to my suggestions for new books to read.

Years went by, and finally I am in my senior year of high school. I picked super easy classes, because why not? Chorus was silly, but whatever. You always supported my choice of sax in band! 

And then that day came. I forgot my chorus folder, and it was first period, so my mom dropped it off in the office. I went to pick it up, and she had left a note on it. ""Call me."" So I asked for the office phone and called her.

I have never gone from happy to suicidal so quickly. My mother told me that you died in a car accident. A drunk driver. I couldn't say anything, just stood there. She asked if I was okay but I didn't answer. I guess I must have, though, because she said goodbye and hung up.

I walked back to chorus and sat down. Then I stood back up and fled to the bathroom, where I bawled my eyes out for four hours. 

I never ran out of tears, and I couldn't ever stop crying. My grades dropped significantly and I skipped a ton of my classes. I couldn't do it without you. I just couldn't.

I wish I could have said goodbye

I wish it hadn't been in December.... you loved winter. It wasn't fair. it isn't fair.

you made me who I am... or was. I used to be shy, but you got me out there and made me social. now, I can't talk to anyone without thinking the worst.

I went to collage. My first year, I had to take the train and then a bus. Sometimes the bus was hours late, so I used to either walk or call for a cab. 

I walked up to a cab one morning, hoping for a ride instead of the shitty bus. I was in luck, they were about to pick someone up from the school! I talked to them the whole ride, and I got their cab two other times. 

The third time I saw this dude, I asked for his name. 

He has your name.

I stopped using cab services. I know it's stupid of me, but I couldn't. That's the tenth person I've met with your name since you left me. 

I made sure I tipped him well that ride, and wish him the best of luck with what he really wanted to do. He wanted the same thing you did.

I almost joined you that day.

I don't know how I'm still here, but I think it's because I know if I killed myself, I would never get to heaven with you. I couldn't stand an eternity alone.

Just... I miss you. I cry myself to sleep at night because I think of you and what could have been. You were so bright, and cheerful, and going places. It should have been me...

I've been taught to be respectful, no matter what the situation is. I make it a personal goal of mine to do a good deed everyday, no matter how small or big, no matter to who.
As a matter of fact, when you walked past me to leave the train and turned your head to me, I thought you sneezed. I almost got annoyed that you sneezed on me. The train was not crowded and you certainly could have turned your head to sneeze the other way. Either way, I shrugged it off, and as you hurried out the door, I wanted to say ""bless you"" but you left so fast.
The doors closed.
I then realized you didn't accidentally sneezed at me. You didn't even sneeze on me purposely. You spit on my right arm and left your phlegm running down my jacket.

It's late, and I'm tired, and maybe the sleep is getting to me. I've spent the last few days with unsure hands, and thoughts that I anchored down before I left. 

It's been three months. 

Three months since I came back, and three months since I started eating again. It's been healthy and nostalgic, and at times it has seemed as if we lived six years in two days. 

Three months, it's been three months since I've tried finding my voice again. 

I cannot simply forget what happened, and the things that I learned on that summer night, and what I know now as fall sets in, it all comes together in one nauseous moment. I'm reliving two days for twenty three years. I am out at sea by no fault of your own.

I've forgiven you, I've set it all aside, but at times I find the wound is not healed, and seas are rough. I know it shouldn't have meant anything to me at all, but you are loved, and I cannot change that. 

You are loved, for six years of my twenty three, you are loved. 

Sailors look to the shore, and we look back - 

Waves and wind buffet across us, but even the rough sea becomes calm. 

You are loved. 

In all of the uncertainty of the world we live in today, I know that you are my rock in the sea. As tides and seasons shift, I look, and I see you guiding me back home. 

I know you never meant to hurt anyone, it was the uncertainty of a world so uncertain with itself.

You are the reason I miss the east coast so much, not because of the beach or the fast lifestyle.  I would trade all of that for you any day.

Do you remember when you asked me what we were?  The words that came out of my mouth that day are the most regretable things I have ever said.  I should have just made you mine right then, and told him to go fly a kite.  In my heart I'm pretty sure that's what you wanted me to do, but I panicked, got choked up, and didn't know what to say.  I think you realized how bad I felt when we had to say goodbye.  I never want to see you cry like that again.  I should have known I was making a mistake... I thought my family and friends here were worth it, but they really weren't.  When you leave home for a long time it's not always how you expect it to be when you get back.  I wish I could convey the emotions I have inside me to you in some way, but I can't even formulate the words to describe it.  I get a feeling that I don't belive anyone else has ever had when I think of you.  It's almost haunting.

I've learned a lot about myself sense we last saw, or even talked to each other.  I've got a lot of problems that I hope so desperatley that you can accept.  I'm going through a lot of changes, leaving a life behind me yet again, only this time I'm not running away, I'm headed straight into the depths of it.  Hopefully I end up pointing the right direction, and when this all pans out, I hope that I'm in a position to come find you.  I want your head to lay on my chest like it used to, I can almost feel your nose brushing against me like it did when you would squeeze me tight.

Your boyfriend is my closest friend. I see the way you treat him and it upsets me. Obviously, I have no say in the matter-- he's a grown man, ten years my senior, and he can make his own choices-- but there are times when I wish I could tell you to have some respect for him. Last night you called him to say you were mad and you weren't coming over so he made other plans. I was hanging out with him when you called him repeatedly until he answered and then you yelled at him. You called him from his bed and demanded that he come home right then and bring ice cream. Seriously? You're a grown woman. 
I wish you would treat him like a person. He's a human being with feelings, just like you. He is not your pet, to deal with as you please. You have no respect for boundaries and it seems like you don't have much self-control at all. You threaten to leave his house and pack up all your stuff dramatically, and you drive around the block and come back. Even after he asks you to go, you refuse. You bug him all the time about wanting to live together when obviously that's something he doesn't feel comfortable with. He's trying to finish school. And sometimes, even in front of me, you ask him trick questions that have no correct answer. No matter what he says you're bound to get upset. How can you think that's acceptable behavior? 

 I see the way you get so caught up in things that don't matter very much. Yes, he makes stupid jokes sometimes. Calm down. You don't need to make a scene, screaming and crying in front of his friends, because he joked about sausages to a vegetarian. Look on the bright side: he has a sense of humor and he's great at cheering people up. There is nothing to be upset about. And if you think about it, really think, and there are still things worth getting this worked up about then dump him. You can't change who he is, and I'm not sure why you would want to. 

Anyway, it would be out of line for me to say any of this so I will continue to bite my tongue. I will listen to him vent his frustrations and I will be there for him when he's depressed, because that's what you're supposed to do for people you care about.

They're all tied up with all that crap I went through, all that crap you pulled me out of. I want to stop complaining to you so bad, but it's either keep talking about it or stop talking entirely. You were the one who asked for the whole story, the story no one else in the world knows, and once I started talking I just couldn't stop.

Well, darling, I *am* broken. I'm bent and bruised and weak and crumpled to the ground. But I have not been shattered completely, not so long as you're there. I don't want to just take from you. I can still give. I'm not empty yet, so take whatever you can. You deserve it. 

I'm not used to being loved like this, so I can't quite believe you won't go away. I can't just take and take and take and not give anything in return. I can't do this to you anymore, but what else is there for me? 

I don't have to be broken. I won't always be, even if it seems like it now. Someday I'll put myself back together--or maybe you'll put me back together, but I think I'd like it best if we did it hand in hand--and I'll be stronger than you can ever imagine.

I'm not used to mentioning you in the same sentence. Maybe it's because together you've made me feel like I shouldn't be quizzical about where I've come from, who made me, and what I could have had.

Mom, you lied to me. Straight out lied. You told me that I went behind your back for the 1 1/2 years I saw my father without telling you; you'd done the same for me by not telling me about my father for 12 years. I think I'm in the right to be butthurt about that.

You married an asshole.

Your wedding day flashes before my eyes with little effort; a 5 year old me, in my white cream dress, hugging your leg on the balcony of our of flat begging you, with tears in my eyes, not to marry him.

10 years later, and you've demanded a divorce how many times? And how many times has he refused to talk about it, all of them you say? I warned you. I told you this would happen, that you'd regret it. I sat in the registry office on your sister's lap crying and that wasn't enough.

Mick, wow. Wow, wow, wow. Perhaps you've failed me as much as my father has. You could have stepped up. You could have been a father figure had you gone about it the right way. But no; you took a Nazi dictator fashion of parenting, or, at least the Nazis rewarded positivity towards their regime, unlike you.

I have worked hard in the last couple of years to obtain outstanding GCSE results. I'm aiming for 5 As. I have one already in Maths, which I took a year early, and I'm telling you this now because YOU NEVER BOTHERED TO ASK ME WHAT I WAS STUDYING. My father did. The second time I saw him that week; 'How's school? College? What are you doing?'.

You've dwarfed me, imitated me, pushed me to the end of a bottomless pit and holy fucking Hell, when I get out of here, you are so done. You're going to regret not looking out for me.

Dad, I have no respect for you. I have no respect for my stepfather either, and as far as I am concerned you have both failed me.

I have gone through Hell and back to get answered. All you've done is deceive me, challenge my beliefs and refuse to acknowledge that you basically left my mother in the gutter. You deserve to die alone with my stepfather, for neither of you deserve anyone else.

You have all in one way or another sickened me over the past 5 years. I have beaten homophobic bullying, tried to come to terms with who I am, study my fucking ass off to the extent that I killed my own social life, started self harming, had a glass thrown at my head, been thrown at a table, taken a punch to the face, ran through the streets barefoot and slept on my friend's sofa after arriving at 11PM because I didn't feel safe.

I'm going to make a better life for myself. In this town, about 90-95% of people are unemployed, happy to slump out in PJs all day and live off the state. Not me. I want to go to university, go to America and work for NASA, marry the woman of my dreams in New York and make a better life for myself.

What is the tom foolery that is twenty first century culture? I can't even step outside without being bombarded by a plethora of hedonistic baloney!

We'll start with the radio. Long gone are the days are the sounds of Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington and the like. Instead it has been replaced with the wub wubbing, two quarter rappers, singing beavers and the woman who thinks you're a farming implement. Frankly, the idea that these people are actually artists is all wet. 

While on the topic of art, let's talk dancing. A broad rubbing her bottom into the crotch of a man is not dancing. Pumping one's fist in the air for one is without care is not dancing. And don't get me started on this broke dancing. That's just a shitty form of gymnastics. Yes it requires skill to do the flippy doos and who has, but most people who do it lack rhythm and it is questionable if they are even listening to the beat. Those who refuse to swing, lindy hop, jive, waltz and other actual dances should be given the bums rush!

Let's talk about dressing. Gentlemen, unless you are about to defecate, pull up your trousers! I don't want to see your undergarments! Also, turn that hat around, it's on backwards you nincompoop! If you don't own a hat, get one. And by God if I see another baseball cap, I'll deliver you such a caning that when you first hold your grandchild, your hands will still be smarting! Real men wear real hats. Also, clothes that fit wouldn't hurt either. 

Ladies, allow me to quote Cole Porter, ""In olden days, a glimpse of stocking was looked on as something shocking but now God knows, anything goes."" You bimbos think about that for a moment, I can walk down the street and expect to see some girl wearing the same quantity of material that I use to floss my teeth. Back in my [grandfather's] day, we called ladies like that harlots and they only dressed like that while on work! Sorry, allow me to correct myself, even common street whores dressed with greater dignity back in the 20s than most girls do today! 

Political rascals, I have a bone to pick with you as well! Back in my [grandfather's] day, when we had a depression, we didn't stage a sit in of wall street! We just said, ""great"" then went off and shot Germans and we did all that with a president who was crippled by polio! That oboe man you have for president isn't going to save you. And stop blaming the 1% for being criminals. Back in the day, men like Al Capone were the 1%! Also, sport, that communications degree is worth less than a degree in mimeograph repair! So dry up and get working!

Also, you fellas who keep saying you are ""forever alone."" Listen up! Your lack of honey is just good old Mr. Darwin making sure you suckers don't muddy up the gene pool! In my [grandfather's] day, we wouldn't stand for no swanky swells sitting inside on their fancy moving picture machines complaining about how they never get between the gams! You want a broad? Go out and get one! Also, broads don't go for any ragamuffin at the juice joint, they want someone whose putting on the Ritz! Having a chinwag with broads isn't that scary. You know what is scary? Storming the rooting-tooting beaches of rooting-tooting Normandy!

I hope you had a good 4th. And I hope you are doing well. Just wanted to say that.

My response:
No, you just wanted to contact me to try to start up the conversation again without having to take any accountability and test where I'm at so you know if you can continue stringing me along or using me as emotional support or to see if I'm upset with you or whatever it is you are doing. I saw you do it with your ex as well and it's incredibly immature and selfish.  No wonder you didn't tell him you were seeing me: he would feel bad and you can't have someone feel bad because of your actions, even if it means lying to their face, right? I can't believe I expected that from you when it was right in front of my face that you don't do that.  Forget not doing those actions in the first place... you don't give two shits about that. You just want people to feel a certain way that benefits you regardless of what you do. You want to feel good no matter how bad your actions make others around you feel.       

Also, I find it incredibly transparent that you sent this on the day [friend] is having his party.  I imagine this is so you can drink away any bad feelings you might have if I didn't contact you.  My guess is that liquor is involved.  Always playing it safe aren't you?  Wouldn't want to have to feel any pain, right? On a more serious note, I'm quite worried about your inability to control your drinking and your use of people who enable you to do so but that is no longer my problem.  I hope you can get the help you need to work through those issues. 

But, since you are fishing for it, I'll tell you where I am at: I'm annoyed that I had to change my schedule around and give up most of my shifts to someone who is not even going to be working there in a month and I am going to be broke this month because of it. I'm annoyed that I had a breakdown of sorts at work as a reaction to the whole situation and I'm in trouble because I couldn't even think straight that day because I couldn't wrap my head around your actions being so different from what you told me because I actually did trust you and took your words to have more meaning than they actually did.  I'm pissed at myself that I ever let you bend a single boundary of mine while receiving no budging from you at all. I'm pissed that I stayed with someone who didn't respect me enough to respect my boundaries. I'm embarrassed that I believed some of the things you said and didn't realize earlier that you were only telling me what you thought I wanted to hear so I would stay around when you really never had any intention of long term, always scanning the horizon for something else. I'm embarrassed that I didn't leave the second your actions stopped matching up with your words. I'm embarrassed that I was with you for nine months without being introduced to a single friend of yours. I'm embarrassed that I was stuck on the sidelines as nothing more than an option for you and I let myself be ok with that.  

But I'm starting to feel better about the whole thing despite all that because in the end, I'm still a really decent person who doesn't do things like that to people and I no longer have to deal with that level of selfish emotional immaturity.  If you are going to contact me, at least have the courtesy to have some depth or honesty or insight. Don't text me this ""I hope you are doing ok"" clichéd bullshit.  My guess is that you will probably go on the defensive in reaction to this letter instead of actually discussing any of it.  It will probably be some emotional response or maybe you will just deny it. Regardless, you will do your best to feel good about the whole situation instead of actually addressing the actions.

I want to end with the fact that I care very much for you, but I now see things weren't as I thought they were.  I can't continue to care for someone or be a part of someone's life who doesn't respect me, my boundaries or truth.  It is a very unhealthy dynamic for me to be in. I need truth and I made the mistake of expecting it from you. I'm not saying you don't value truth but our understanding of what truth is is very, very different. Please let me grieve the relationship ending. Any terms you enjoyed before the breakup are no longer valid. I thought we might have a future together, even as friends if not lovers, but I have no interest in maintaining an emotionally immature one-sided relationship that caters only to you and I no longer see friendship as an option.

You never shut up, you never leave me alone, youre so fucking needy its ridiculous. Youre always eating, and then bitching that there is no food in the house, you utterly disgust me with how much you consume. And stop eating shit that i was clearly saving! do you know how frustrating it is to come home from 13 hr shifts looking forward to that last piece of my birthday cake, and seeing your fat ass on the couch eating it? really? fuck you. 

You are a truly disgusting human being. you never pay your bills and now my credit is taking the hit, and then you have the nerve to ask me for money? what the hell?! stop fucking blowing it all on cigarettes. Its clearly a habit you cannot afford, and im damn well not going to pay for it for you. 

You make the assumption that i always want you around. Fuck no. I want to get away from you. Stop assuming my friends are your friends. they aren't. My friends want nothing to do with you. I don't want you following us wherever the fuck we go, whether it be in the apartment or out the door. you have your own god damn friends. 

Stop trying to bond with me over depression. That is not something i want to share with anyone. Its a fucking disease, not  something to connect with someone over, or be super bestest friends with someone over. I love how you magically discovered symptoms of it 2 days after i try to kill myself. And then you brag about being on medication? really? are you that desperate for attention? to be in the spot light? I have news for you, its not something you want attention for. Its fucking hard, and it never gets any easier. And on that same note, when my friends come to check up on me, they dont want to hear every fucking detail of every fucking problem that you have!

Stop trying to bond with me over my fucking piercings. No, i don't want you to get the same ones as me, because i don't want to be twinsies with you. Get your own fucking style. Stop trying to be like me. You aren't ""a badass"", hell, im not a badass, but for some reason you act like i am. Thanks for the compliment, but enough is enough. 

Stop telling me what you think everyone thinks you said. Just stop. My mom never mentions you. My dad never mentions you. they don't give a fuck about you, your problems, your life, your job. NOTHING. You know what they care about? me. their daughter. Believe it or not, you do not come up in every conversation that i have. all of your ""oh, i bet they totally think im a bitch."" or ""oh, let me guess they were pretty surprised about my ____"" no. they didnt say that. You need to stop making yourself this grand being that haunts everyone's thoughts. 

Stop telling me that you can make every male friend i have gay. For the love of all that is holy, no one fucking finds you attractive, especially them. I hate to break it to you, but they like BOOBS, and not man boobs like you have. No, you cannot make them gay. No, you are not this ""sexual god"" that you think you are.  No, my friends wouldn't ""totally sub for you"" Your are the furthest thing from the symbol of male dominance. No. Just fucking no. And stop arguing with me when i tell you they won't either. JUST FUCKING STOP IT. You are driving me fucking insane. 

Stop acting like a girl! oh my god, i have boobs and im more of a guy than you. Stop telling me that you are ""totally PMSing"" with me, or that i must be on my period because you can sense it... two weeks before my period. You have no fucking clue what you are talking about. Please just stop trying to figure out my bodily functions. they are none of your business. 

Stop telling me my cat loves you. She doesnt. Why else would she run for my room when you come home? She only puts up with you because when im at work youre the only one who can feed her. stop thinking youre taking her when we move out. Shes licensed in my name, i pay the bills for her, hell, i pay the bills for your cat. You can barely take  care of yourself, let alone anything else. 

When i come home from work i don't want to talk about my day, i don't want to have in depth talks with you about life, i don't want to hear about your day. I want to be left the fuck alone. How many times do i have to tell you that? On that note, since when does quietly reading a book in my room indicate that i want you to barge in and start telling me every little detail of your entire life? Just leave me the fuck alone! 

Guess what? no, i am not re-signing this lease. No, we will not be roommates forever. No, i will never in a million years get a house with you. I can't wait to get away from you. From your constant talking, from your constant hounding, from asking me for money that i don't have for stupid shit you don't need. Only 7 more months. I am gone as soon as i can get out.

I rolled over and I leaned to kiss you good morning. It's been almost three months since you cheated on me and left me. It's been almost a week since you told me you hated nearly everything about me and found nothing redeeming. It's been over two weeks since you sent a text to one of my new friends to ask about my drinking problem you've heard I developed. 

I didn't develop a drinking problem. Sure I drink more than before this happened, but that's due to having never had a drink before. I drink socially. I'm allowed to. 

I'm still hurt and I still miss you. It's not that neurotic ache of emptiness, I just wish I knew what my best friend was up to. We were together for almost two and a half years. Two of which were the happiest years of my short life. Two years we spent arguing who loved who more. Two years we spent enthralled in each other. Two years spent learning and being best friends. Gone? Gone because you didn't feel enough affection in these last few months? I fucked up. I recognize now all the hints and signs you dropped that I never picked up on. I loved you, I tried showing it in the best way I could. I wanted you forever, so I tried to give you what I thought you wanted. I thought you would hate to never know another man so I told you that you could sleep with another man if you needed it. If you needed to sleep with someone else in order to know you wanted to be with me forever then I was okay with it. I could suffer the indignity. If, if it meant I had you forever. That isn't what you meant, you didn't want the opportunity to sleep around,  you wanted me  to tell you I wanted you all to myself forever and ever. You wanted to know I was still mesmerized by you. Wanted to know you were the only person for me. That I wanted to be the only person for you. I did. It hurts to know you're so much happier without me. It hurts to know you don't miss me. That I can't talk to you.

I didn't try to steal you friends or spirit them away. I never blasphemed your name. I never seriously belittled you to them. I teased in the manner I always have, it made me feel better but I always made sure they knew I didn't really think you were a whore or a slut. You aren't. I let you fall in love with someone else. I let you fall out of love with me. 

I'm not a fool, nor so melodramatic to believe no one will ever love me. Honestly, I've even had success with a few girls. Not a ton but enough to boost my confidence. To remind me I could be desirable to someone. I'm enjoying being single to a degree. More than I thought I would. But I really miss you. I wish I knew how to not be bitter towards you. I wish I knew how to stop being so angry and full of hate towards you. It's not constant, but it comes in waves. Waves where I hate you. Where I can't stand you. Then waves where I'm disgusted with myself for feeling that way. 

You were the love of my life. You were the summer sun in the sky. You were the reason I rushed home every day. Every single day. The reason I smiled or laughed. We grew up together. In two years we became adults. You made that last year of high school the only one that mattered to me, gave me memories I'll always cherish. I loved you. I still do. I can't say I'm in love with you anymore. I'm too hurt to still be in love with you. But I miss you. I wish I could get over my pain so we could be friends again.

Life was shitty, I refused therapy, I wasn't in school, and I spent all my time on WoW. My life was nothing, and I was ready to die. Then out of nowhere you appeared in my life. I don't know how it happened, but you turned into my beacon of light. You talked to me every day. You stayed awake with me all night even though you had work the next morning. Remember when I only slept for 7 hours over the course of 8 days, and you talked to me every moment that you could manage? Best and worst week of my life.

Though you were 9 years older than me, I fell for you eventually, and I fell for you hard. What more could you expect? It's not like I was co-dependant on you for my happiness, though. If anything YOU were the one depending on me. I just enjoyed the company and believing that someone cared about me. Though, for the first few months the majority of our conversations were about how a previous girlfriend had smashed your heart a few years back, and was jerking you around again. You tried to pursue her, ended up hurt just like I'd predicted, and babbled on to me for months about how you just wanted someone to hold and reciprocate your love. 

Eventually we ended up together in a long-distance relationship, but I was underage so I couldn't come visit the first year. I knew I shouldn't have flown out to see you the day after I turned 18. I'm not stupid. I know better than to meet random internet guys that live 2k miles away and are 9 years older. If I can be honest though, I lacked so much self respect that I thought I wouldn't care if anything shitty happened to me. *Well I guess I can't feel any worse than I already do. This has the potential to be awesome, and I'm willing to risk it.* Even though you'd talked me out of suicide, I was still suffering from my awesome mental instabilities.

Anyway, I was wrong. So very, very, wrong. After I spent 3 awesome weeks there, mostly okay with everything that went on, returned home, and you completely ignored me for weeks; I snapped. I went on a self-hate filled rampage of sleeping with other guys vying for your attention. Of course I got it again eventually, but you'd already had what you wanted from me and it didn’t last long. After all of that you've had the balls to come back around multiple times in the last year to try to convince me that ""I've always cared."" and that ""I still love you and I want to give you another chance."" Me? Another chance? Yeah, because I'm the one who took advantage of complete, innocent, naive, trust and used you. I even found out a few months ago that you cheated on me. Twice. Before I met you irl. Thanks!

Really, I was just hoping that someone actually cared about me. I'm lucky that I pulled myself together a few months after everything happened. You saved me, but for a while there I wished that you hadn't. So you know what asshole? Take your shitty depressing memories back. I don't want them anymore.

A small update: It’s been a few years since I wrote this, and I’m still not exactly sure if I wrote it to him, at him, or to get my thoughts straight on the matter. It’s been a rough road.

1332208316.0,12,self.UnsentLetters,r4f5u,Long Letter to an Ex-Girlfriend 3 Years Past (X-Post /r/Self),Green_Bird_23,14,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/r4f5u/long_letter_to_an_exgirlfriend_3_years_past_xpost/,"Alt-account here. I wrote this letter to an ex-girlfriend. I want to send it, but I realize it would be a bad thing if I did. So I'm posting it here. Just to get it out there. To tell someone my story without too much judging. I can't talk to my friends about it because I have a girlfriend right now whom I love very much, so this is my only outlet. I hope you can share your thoughts after you read it. Names have been omitted to protect the innocent and not so innocent. WARNING: VERY LONG

&gt;First and foremost, let me put it out there that I’m not trying to or intending to break up either of our relationships. This letter is meant as a therapy of sorts; possibly to get some questions answered. But then again, the last time we even spoke you made it very clear you never want to talk to me again. So this letter is more than likely unwelcome, but 3 years later, there are somethings that I need to say. 

&gt;It’s hard losing your best friend. I have to admit, losing you not only as my significant other but my best friend, the person I instinctively called when I had some hair brained scheme or some adventure in the city to go on. Memories of you are easy to come boy. Places, people, a t-shirt, a photo, a song, a movie, they all remind me of things that happened. I can’t listen to “Linger,” or The Format or Matchbox Twenty without thinking of you. Either from the first CD you gave me or our trip out to GM to see Matchbox Twenty. We paid an arm and a leg ofr seats in the absolute last row of the arena, not to mention the two hour subway and bus ride out there and getting lost on the campus.

&gt;Or it’s a t-shirt. Like the Salute Your Shorts Camp Anawanna shirt you got me for my birthday. You gave it to me standing outside your dorm after we had dinner. You left me early that night because you had work you needed to do.

&gt;It’s a movie. It’s “Nightmare Before Christmas.” We went to see it on Halloween. It was a late show and we got out after the subway had shut down, but unluckily for us, there was a cab strike that night as well. So we ended up having to walk the three and a half miles back to campus. I know it was three and a half miles because I looked it up when we got back and I called to tell you. Or it’s “Pulp Fiction” (OH MAN, I SHOT MARVIN IN THE FACE!) that became an inside running joke for us. Or it’s Wall-e, which I still can’t watch without getting emotional and upset. 

&gt;There are other things that don’t even need a trigger. Things like meeting your brother in Chinatown, or meeting your parents. I don’t know if I ever told you about it, but I had eaten with my family before meeting your parents and I was so nervous that I threw up in the parking lot of the McDonalds near campus. that was the same weekend we took the incredibly awkward trip for dinner with my family. 

&gt;A. holds a lot of memories. Eating at that Irish pub on K. St, trying to find that lacrosse store in that godforsaken suburban hellhole. Me using the stick as a magical staff on the escalators. We had just gotten back from break, and after that you wanted to go to the Staples in B. You were cold walking from the subway station, I gave you my coat, boasting that I had been a scout and scouts don’t get cold. 

&gt;There are not so good memories though. The awkward Jimmy Eat World concert comes to mind. Or that disastrous first date we had on your birthday. I’m surprised now that you still eventually wanted to be friends with me after that. I completely admit I don’t remember what movie we saw, but I do remember practically begging you to go out with me while waiting for Capitol Steps. I also remember being VERY touchy feely, probably to the point of being creepy. For that I apologize. 

&gt;After that, you pulled away, but I still saw you twice a week in class. You got Stephen Lynch tickets as an apology gift. A couple of days later, I got detripled. You let me cry like a girl, which in retrospect, I did a lot while you knew me. Then you helped me move. Reflecting on our relationship, now I feel like that was one of the defining moments of our relationship. Really, there were four, that being the first. 

&gt;The second was Valentines day. We weren’t dating yet. I had just gotten the bad news about an old girlfriend that I still cared about. She had just been diagnosed with cancer. It was late, I called you upset and you came over. You listened to me talk and cry and rant into the early morning. Eventually you said you needed to sleep, so I walked you back to your dorm. You hugged me, told me I would be okay and then kissed me on the cheek. That’s when I thought you felt the same way about me as I about you.

&gt;The third was the first kiss. It was just over a week later. on the 22nd. of February. We had been watching, “The Golden Compass,” (which I finally got around to reading). I walked you back to your dorm. It was cold and I was wearing athletic shorts and flip flops. It began to flurry and I hemmed and hawed and finally asked to kiss you. You said yes and I felt that all was right with the world. 

&gt;The fourth I’m guessing you know. The break up. You know what happened up to that point. It was drizzling. After you left me standing in nearly the same spot as our first kiss I call my mother and then my friend. We went down to the Earth Day concert in an effort to cheer me up. It rain on me, I got absolutely soaked and the concert was canceled. The effort failed The world was reflecting my agony. 

&gt;In thinking about these times, it makes me realize I needed you more than you needed me. It’s painfully obvious to me now. The clinginess, the insecurities, the paranoia all spread from this unrealized need I had. I caused the break up, no denying that. But if it’s any consolation, I’m no longer that person, in large part because of you. Though not completely secure, I no longer have anxiety attacks; I no longer worry or wonder.

&gt;But there are questions that remain and maybe that’s why all of all the girls I’ve dated, you’re the only one I still hold a candle for. I have no illusions that we’d even be together again, and I’m very happy with who I am with now, but I’d be lying if I told you I was over you. And because of that, questions remain. 

&gt;Question that frankly, I need answered. Questions like did you cheat on me like I suggested? Questions like why did you agree to be friends wand give me a chance if you never intended to date me again? And what did that CD you gave me in Penn Station really mean? There are other questions too, but you get the idea. 

&gt;I don’t know you anymore. People change a lot over the span of 3 years. I’m no longer the clingy boyfriend. I’m no longer the mediocre achiever in school. It may take me 5 years to graduate, but that’s better than never graduating at all. I went through a personal hell afte rthe break up. Things I’m not proud of, things I wish I could change, but it’s my past now. I’m now in a happy relationship with a girl I love very much. A girl I see a future with. So I’m trying to move on.

&gt;The what-if’s remain though. What if I had been a little different, what if you had reacted different. These will never be answered. But the questions I’ve posed to you can be. They’re the whole purpose of the letter, to lay to bed the lingering questions and doubts. I want to move on and I need to move on, but it’s difficult.

&gt;I’ve lost many friends over the years. Some important, some I barely knew. But your friendship and love are the one I miss. I guess because to me, you’re the one that got away. Nothing to do about that now. All I can say now is I’m sorry and I hope you don’t hold it against me. 

**TL;DR: Got dumped by a girl, still not over her.**

There aren't enough words or actions in the universe for me to accurately express my gratitude. I know you say it's nothing and that you love me and that you'll always be here for me but I don't think you understand what that means to me. I've been dismissed and ignored and actively disregarded by so many people in my life up until this point and it still shocks me that you notice. That you care.

You saved my life over the summer. I was going to go home from school and hang myself, it was already decided. But then you friend requested me and you wanted to talk to me. You weren't overbearing, you weren't pushy, you didn't have ulterior motives. You just wanted to talk. And that's exactly what I needed. I didn't even want a relationship at first - I was still pretty sure I was going to kill myself. But there was something about you that kept me going. You were funny and you were engaging and you understood my little quirks and shared your own. I remember nights over the summer where I'd get home from work and I would be upset and poised to hurt myself. I'd sit at my desk and wonder if it was a scissors or knife night when I'd look up to a message from you. And I'd respond absently but hours later I'd find I'd completely forgotten about hurting myself. And I began looking forward to every time we got to speak.

You saved my life last night. I don't know what came over me and how a little worry turned into genuine suicidal thoughts, but you were there. You saw me falling apart and you saw me losing grip and you held on to me. I saw you crying, I don't know if you noticed that I did. You were so worried, and so was I. But you didn't let go. You held me all night even though you weren't supposed to be there. I felt safe with you. I always feel safe with you. 

I cannot thank you enough for what you've done for me. So I will simply continue to love you with all my heart. And with your arms around me when we fall asleep, I know I can overcome this.

If I don't say this I may explode, so here it goes:

Fuck you for thinking I'd be helpless without you. Are you that fucking arrogant to think that I'd fall apart if it weren't for you? I'm a completely different person when you're not around, but you don't know that because you're not there to see it. And you don't even let me be that person when you are around. You seem to have no faith in my competence, intelligence or strength and I'm sick of it. Truth be told, I'm BETTER when you're not around. I make things work and I do a good job of it. I did that for 15 months, for two years, for years and years before that and every single day when you're not around. The only reason I force myself to be so weak around you is because I've learned that that's how you like it, and that's the kind of person I am: always being the person that people like me to be. The meek wife, the good sport, the compassionate listener, and sometimes the strong leader that holds things together (but I always leave that role for you when you're there to take it.) 

What would I do without you? I'd fucking figure it out, like I always do. The only reason I didn't last night is because I knew you'd feel awful if I came home on the bus. You would have felt useless, and I know that uselessness is a terrible thing for you. I honestly felt more comfortable sitting there miserably waiting to hear from you than taking care of it myself, because I always put your feelings ahead of mine. And even if I actually send you this email I will probably continue to do those stupid things because that's the kind of person I am. 

You've been too fucking arrogant and cocky lately and you know I could never tell you that to your face. But I'm tired of holding it in all the time. It's going to catch up to you soon, and if I never say anything then it's going to be just as much my fault when it does. And no one else is going to tell you. I don't know what will come of this email, but I had to get it out.

I'm sorry if this upsets you or ruins your day, but I'd be sitting here festering and having a completely terrible day myself without saying anything. 

Love,
Your wife

I can't tell you that I love you. I want to tell you so bad. I'm pretty sure that you know. I must be patient. I don't want to rush you. Put pressure on you. But I'm beginning to get the feeling. The feeling that if I don't tell you that I love you that my heart is going to explode.

I love that you make me feel this way. I thought that it would never be possible for me to feel this way again. You have taught me, in less than 2 months, that I never even understood how good being in love could ever possibly feel. I love you because you understand, support, and care about me in a way that no one else ever has. 

I will be able to express this to you someday. But it's completely inappropriate at this point. We were friends for such a long time. I like to think that I knew you well before we decided to stop denying how much we wanted to be together. And now I'm finally getting down into the crevasses of your psyche. And I love every part of it. Every goofy face, every violent crazy thought, every wackadoodle opinion about the way the world works, every insane thing that comes out of your mouth. I love it all. 

I know that you like to pretend that you are hesitant to fall head over heels in love, even though it is obvious that we both are. I know that you are afraid to feel that vulnerable again. I know that you want to make sure that we do this right. And that makes me love you even more. So, understand that while you are sitting there pretending to be calm and not totally in love, I'm doing the same thing. Not because it's what I want to do, but because it's what you need me to do. 

A thousand times, I love you.

1321115505.0,11,self.UnsentLetters,m9uqn,To the man who I used to call Dad.,fitfulsleeper21,12,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/m9uqn/to_the_man_who_i_used_to_call_dad/,"Dear Dad,

You weren’t my biological father, but you were my dad for 15 years. You raised me and loved me and I could never call anyone else dad.  When I was 15, you and mom had a bad breakup, and it was a hard time for all of us. She said a lot of bad things about you and I suddenly became the messenger between you two. You sunk deeper into drinking, and when I visited you I just felt awkward and stuck in the middle of the mess.

But, I was in high school and had a busy life, you moved to another town, so I didn’t see you much and that gave us space to deal with all going on. I visited occasionally, called sometimes to check-up. But I was always the one calling to check-in, you never called me first unless it was for me to tell something to mom or get something of yours that you left at the house.  I talked to my stepsisters (your daughters) and they said you were pulling away from them too, so I tried not to take it too personally that you were growing distant. As months of little contact went by I told myself it was because you were going through a rough time. And you were, I still know that.

The first big effect was that you stopped coming to my soccer games. You were always my biggest fan and I missed your presence. But, I knew you lived far away and it was hard to get someone to drive you all the way there. 

I don’t remember which order these next events came in exactly, but the pain from each are fresh in my memory.

I remember going to thanksgiving that year and feeling oddly out of place with my now ex step-family. I remember that Christmas, when I gave you your present, you reached down and gave me a bag back. You had given all your daughters different colored bags of soaps and stuff, and I was so happy to have been included. But then I realized you given me the bag that had been intended for  the sister who wasn’t there. You hadn’t remembered me after all. While you played cards I spent the next hour in the corner eating alone with my ex and making small talk with the other relatives before I made an excuse to leave, and I had wished you realized how awkward it felt for me to be there since the break-up.

When I had a lead in the musical, I told you the dates and looked for your face in the crowd. You will never have any idea how crushed I was when on the last night, I still didn’t see you. My friends came, my ex bf’s parents came, my bosses came. But you didn’t. I cried in the bathroom, feeling so stupid and like it was a scene straight out of some clichéd lifetime movie.

Another Christmas came around. You hadn’t called and invited me to the usual family-get together for Christmas so I figured you must not be doing anything. Mom had to work so I was driving to my ex’s house  when I decided to call you, it'd been a while since we talked. I could hear noise in the background as I wished you happy holidays, and you told me you were cooking and the girls were over. I told you to send my love before I hung up, and I cried again. You hadn’t invited me.

On my birthday in January, you didn’t call me. You didn’t send a card. I heard nothing.

Nothing. At this point I was angry, too angry to even cry anymore. Angry with you, because I am not good at keeping contact with people but I tried to keep you in my life, and I wanted you to try for me. I knew you weren’t the type of guy who was open with emotions or anything, but I felt like our relationship was barely there anymore and you didn't seem to give two shits. 

I began to doubt myself, if you wanted me in your life at all. You had four other legitimate daughters, I was just the daughter of a woman you weren’t with anymore. I angrily told myself that you were the adult here, and that if you wanted to keep a relationship with me then you damn well better call me.

You never did, so I stayed stubborn and never did.  June came, your birthday came and father’s day came and I didn’t call you. I was bitter and wondered if you even noticed that I didn’t.

I think the last time I spoke to you was when you showed up at my high school graduation. We have a picture together, we caught up briefly that day. I think that was it. 

3 years have gone by since then without another word between us. Your daughters and your sisters still call me occasionally and talk to me on fb, but not you. You have no idea how much it hurt me to lose all contact with you, and I literally dialed your number numerous times before hanging up. I kept wondering, did you love me anymore? Was I now a completely fatherless girl?

I am not good with these types of things and you were always such a stoic man who didn’t talk about his feelings, so I didn’t know what to even say or if you would even want to talk about it. But I wanted to call you and straight up ask: 'do you want me in your life at all? Be mature, tell me now and let's be done with this.'

But I couldn’t. I was still waiting for you to be the adult and to take care of me and reassure me and all those things adults are supposed to do. That fathers are supposed to do.

You added me on fb a year ago and I never said a word to you, nor you a word to me. I lost my phone long ago and lost your number so I had the excuse that for a while I couldn’t contact you anyway. But, now with fb I have no more excuses. My only excuse is my bitterness and my hurt feelings. I’ve written you messages that I’ve never sent, asking all those questions that bother me, if you want to be my dad or not, asking if you even care about me anymore, if you want to reopen a relationship.

But I’m too scared to hit send. I'm too scared to ask. I'm a coward and even when I think I am a mature adult, I revert back to an insecure little girl when I think about you.

I found out a few months ago that you have a new baby boy. Other than being kind of grossed out that someone would still sleep with your old fat butt, I feel like that was the nail in the coffin.  You have a new life, a new family. I am not the baby anymore.

I told myself that I gave you up a long time ago, but I still think about you sometimes and the memories almost always make me cry. I think about stretching out on the bed together watching Quantum Leap and Andy Griffin and all those other old shows that I only ever watched with you after I got off school. I think about your nickname for me and how you were the only one to ever call me that. I think about how whenever we got in the car and I would ask where we were going, without fail you would say Africa. I think about how you would ride bikes with me to every soccer practice, how you would be the only one to come to my games since mom worked all the time. I think about watching the movie ‘Santa Claus’ with you every Christmas and going to the movies on Sunday afternoons, just me and you, and that your favorite movies were the Back to the Future series. I think about how I could get whatever I wanted out of you because I was the baby. Your only defense was telling me to go ask mom, because we both knew that whatever I asked, you would probably give-in. I think about the distinct smell of your work-clothes and the way you would fart loudly in front of my friends without a care in the world. I got all my worst humor from you.
 
I told myself that I don't need you in my life and I've been fine without you, but I still miss you. I’m a new person now though and I wonder what it would have been like to have had a dad in my life while I was going through the things I was in college. When my ex broke my heart, what you would have said to make me feel better. When I traveled through a new country and learned another language. What you would say now about my doubts about my major and my doubts about my future and my fights with my roommates and my loans and my problems with mom and all that life stuff. 

I’m not who I was when I was 15 and I don’t think you are who you were when I was a kid, or at least the person I thought you were, and we are strangers now. It's been 6 years since you left home, 3 years since we've even seen each other, but it seems like a lifetime has passed and I don’t know you anymore. I see myself walking down the aisle alone when I get married, and it hurts so much to have lost 2 fathers in my life.

I know I should toughen up and contact you already before I live to regret it like I did with my real dad, but even with that guilt looming over me, it’s easier said than done. I feel like we missed that moment, that too much time has passed and that our lives are too separate now. And anyway, I don’t think about you much anymore, so I'm fine right? 

But when I do think about you, it's at times like this when it’s late at night and I feel sad and am thinking about the past. When I’m thinking about my regrets and the people I’ve lost and the people I miss. 

You’re up at the top, and I just thought you should know.

I managed to do that again with another dear friend.

Yes, you were originally intended to fill the space of the first one, and there's no point about lying about that anymore. 

But you saw through the vitriol, and you did something about it. You felt the hate as your own and shanked through the darkness to help me rise out of it. And then you cracked through the shell, just a little bit. 

[This year won't end well if I keep finding people who want to break me open.]

That's what you did, though. You showed compassion, caring, and just a little bit of coyness; both of us know that up until now I haven't been lucky enough to experience these things. And then you, the shy one, kicked down even more unseen barriers. So we started to scrap together some sort of mutual affection out of dust and lint and whatever we could scatch together and built some makeshift companionship fueled only by the occasional textual discourse. But I treasured this kicked-together jumble of emotions, I treasured it like it was my life-savings. I don't know if you realized that it was important to me, or if you fully comprehend how signifigant this is.

Why did you leave me? Would it not have been better to talk this out as I had suggested? Instead you leave me with barely three lines of excuse. I still can't place my finger on what attracted me to you. Objectively, you're not the best looking. You're intelligent but not particularly outgoing. You are a bit submissive too... There's nothing about you that particularly stands out and yet I find it all appealing. Your faults are surprisingly cute too. 

I loved that small coal that kicked into my body when I slowly realized you liked me back. No, I don't care how naive or childish this sounds, either. I want to experience this too; I never had a chance to complete these cycles as a child. I don't want to do this whole masquerade, though. I don't want to give up this precious sliver of BEING that you'd gifted to me. I don't want to be numb again, and it was my mistake for claiming that that route would be better. 

I just want to talk to you! I just want to talk to someone! I deserve this as much as any of the other 7 billion fuckers on this planet. I know you have your life and your friends and your school and your job but I don't have any of these, and now I don't even have you. 

But what can I do? You have cut me off completely.

I guess I'll just wait for you to come back.

Still. In my mind I've compared it to Twilight - the intensity and depth of that relationship. I've had longer, more constructive relationships since, but none could touch the magic ours had. 


We learned a lot from each other and spilled our souls to each other and we were best friends. The problems started when you wanted to be my only friend. You were the loner who was too cool for school and I was still the insecure girl whose default setting was to doubt everything. I've seen the rougher sides of a lot of peoples' personalities, and I was always looking for the catch, the ""real"" reason you wanted to be with me. But you made me believe.


There's one vivid memory I love returning to now and then. It was summer vacation and my mom had just left for work. I of course was sleeping in, but the night before you'd asked me to leave the door unlocked after my mom left. I did and went back to sleep. You found me asleep and woke me up with a kiss. The sunlight was streaming through my blinds, and that state I was in where I was still waking up, gave it all a dream-like quality. The obvious happened, but afterward when I was trying to keep that moment magical forever, you just stared at me with this look and told me I was beautiful, and that's the first time I believed it, ever. I have plenty of memories, though.


I'd probably start crying if I ever were to tell you this to your face. I'm trying not to tear up as I write this but I've had a few years to come to grips with everything. I love the feeling I had then, the newness and the mystery, the wonder, the joy. You. You did something to me that no one else has ever been able to do. I don't know what it is, but even after every dick move and flippant comment and the just plain immature behavior, it hasn't sullied the rest.


I don't really let myself think about you. You come to mind in one way or another at least every day I'd say, but times like these are really the only times I let myself slip back into that, where I let myself remember the feelings I had then and how wonderful they felt. I remember the shoebox full of all the little love notes and letters you'd written me, just as I remember how you hoarded all of mine. I threw mine out when my guy at the time was showing insecurity over them. You told me on one of the rare occassions we talked that you had thrown yours out also. I didn't want to believe it, because as logical as I am, it feels good to feed the starving longing sometimes. I do think you threw them out though, as you aren't really one to hang onto things once they're.. no longer options.


I still go to the park where I feel like I can still feel you the most, feel ""us."" I park on the street but don't get out, I just look out the window and let the memories wash over me. I'll unbuckle, light a cig, recline my seat, turn off the radio, and think. Any time I'm feeling overly stressed out or out of sync, I'll just park there in that spot and contemplate shit. I think being there has less to do with you specifically, and more to do with how carefree and innocent I was then, and I can just let go of my current frustrations or worries and just escape back to that... That fairytale love.


You opened my eyes to a lot of things. The fact that we ended badly doesn't take away from all you gave me, we 17-year-olds just weren't ready for what we wanted.  You showed me that my sheltered world wasn't all there was to be had. You loved me and you let me love you, and know you, and I swear I wish I could knit a sweater out of the feelings you gave me, and never take it off. But, like with all things when growing up, shit happens. You couldn't handle what happened to us, and there's no way I wouldn't have handled it.


I think we're the kind of people who are always going to be drawn toward each other, which is why I think our situation now is best. We have our mutual friends, and we hear of each other from time to time, but that's it. We both still live in the never-changing town we fell in love in, but in never seeing one another, that fact seems almost surreal. But the bench where you made me your girlfriend is still there. The stop sign on the corner where you told me you loved me for the first time still stands. And all the memories of our sweet, sweet love, are forever in my heart.

when i first realized i liked you we were sitting with our backs against the wall near the north entrance where the pottery exhibits were displayed.  you read me a letter by he-who-shall-not-be-named-#1

i remember when i realized you were one of my best friends.  i was dealing spades at the penultimately southern-most roundtable and you of course were my partner.

i remember when i knew you were more important to me than anyone else in my life.  i woke at 4am on a blustery december morning, it was still pitchblack and you were waiting to go back east to visit your family.  we sat on the carpet with our backs against the cushions near the library entrance, right next to where you had once knocked my head against the wall while jumping on me, so that i would call you martha, mistakenly for wayne's awkward [ex]-girlfriend- this jumping on me i would come to love, you begging to 'play'.  but on that winter morning you gave me a slender bracelet braided with sinew with an ovid checkered bead which i would wear on my ankle to hide even when it left bruises from my shoes.  [a year later I would be wearing another of your beaded bracelets on my wrist while working at the pretzel stand when it exploded and mixed the purple plastic in the tubs of fixings.]

i remember the next month when they sat me down and told me i could never speak to you again and the lies they told about what had happened to you which made me cry and rue their malicious mendacity to this day.  how our friend walked me to the field afterwards, late to dinner, and the snow thick on the grass, and we sat on the bench in the snow and cried together.

and when i realized i loved you.  another early morning at the house though now it was spring. which couch we laid upon i clearly recall, the lime green sweater-vest shirt you wore which matched your eyes and where your head rested as we laid together for the first and only time for almost a year.  an ineffable kiss broken by the sound of he-who-shall-not-be-named-#2 coming in through the riachi warrior entrance and me sprinting like a flash towards the dorms, running barefoot over the sharp stone paths which i felt not at all, leaving my sandals and backpack conspicuously there as evidence.  i jumped in the shower giddy and laughing nearly yelling for the next ten minutes 'it was worth it' waking up the dorm to their sleepy curiosity.

i remember a month later when you were sitting on a bench near the pond and i decided to go for a run around the property line, and each i circled i got to see you there for twenty seconds as i ran by, and so excited i would run the circuit again more than a mile just so i could see you for twenty seconds, and i did so 7 more times telling myself that perhaps you sat there each time for the same reason, that evanescent duration we shared

i remember a few weeks later when we walked back from the millhouse together near midnight with our best friends and we shouted and cursed and laughed at the silly crap we had had to put up with, how it all was a joke.  i wonder what i would give just for those five minutes of reckless solidarity once more the four of us shared.

i remember when you first introduced me to your dad and our parents talked.

i remember the cards you would make and the three things you would draw on them.

i remember when we began acting like cold war spies, leaving a notebook in the cubby at the end of the hall in which we would tease and gossip. i remember when the doubts came that you were merely mimicking what i had written.

i remember how i went to arizona to visit a school and while i had gone you had sang for everyone and how disappointed i was that i could not hear.  i recall the song even though i wasn't even there...

i remember she gave us 15 minutes to speak and we both sat there staring at each other, unable to talk.  nervous yes but content to be in one another's proximity.  this situation means more than i can still comprehend...

i remember when you gave me your adoption papers and i recall your consanguinity as i do the city in which you were born and your birthdate.

i remember when you got to run last light and played my favorite songs, favorite because they reminded me of you. in time all music seemed to be referring to you.

i remember the last week i was there when you were running what was almost a pastime for us, one would run and the other would 'be on', and sloane hugging you and you flirting back not three feet from me and how hollow i felt then.

i remember your confession in our notebook later that week and how i decided i couldn't do it, that i just hurt too much.

i remember when i first got to see you 'free'.  the parking lot at the airport, at night because my plane was delayed, where i gave you the ring it took me a month to save up for.  i still remember it costs 330 dollars discounted from 800 because i knew an employee.  i still remember what i wrote on the wrapping that ramble of janis joplin and how i wrote it in blue pen and i believe a smiley face.  i recall what we did first next to the beach where later that week we would take pictures and though i have no pictures of you at all i still remember exactly that i am biting your cheek and you are wearing a black shirt.  i remember your face even though i haven't even seen a picture in more years than i care to state precisely.  i remember how your hair feels, how your breath tastes of the morning, how you move in your sleep, your diffident smile when you show your teeth, your giddy smile where you push your chin down and turn sideways, i remember the heat of your skin, i remember too much, more than i care to, more than you probably care that i recall. i remember the cologne i used to cover up your smell.  i remember the rest of that night, the couple in the next room i never met, sleeping all of 3 hours in the bed in what was supposed to be my room, how we smoked on the porch looking at the moonlight on the ocean over the trees.

i remember the lighthouse, the little shack near the jetty where we would go every day to get smoothies and chowder, the other store where you played keno where i once took a picture of you in the car while the sun set amaranthine behind you.

i remember the shop where you got your tattoo and the woman who did it, and the hard orange plastic benches across the street and on the other side where we bought matching black mugs with green glaze inside, the only thing of ours i retain, out of sight, too many reminders remaining all the same manifest within existence

i remember how you got a parking ticket and how we took pictures and fought it and won.

i remember how we went and played mini-golf across from the movie store and you bragged that i got three holes in one and i was happy that you seemed to be proud of that feat.

i remember how we went to a picturesque beach with white sands and no waves, low sandbars, deserted just for us, with tussocks of grasses blowing with the zephyrs standing at the very edge of america looking out at the atlantic.  i recall afterward what movie we went to see and where we sat in the back row.

i remember the arcade upstairs from the place where we bought a birthday necklace for our friend, the crappy italian place we ate at, the music shop with all the imported cds, the club where we went to get your brother and the red shirt i wore with your purple beaded bracelet which woudl explode in time, the army surplus store down the street where i bought a blue corduroy jacket across from the slight park and farther down from the beach where we walked at night.

i recall the restaurants we ate at with your family and the tables where we sat and positions.

i recall the bed we slept in and wasted entire days in searching each other's body.

i remember details insignificant to all but my memory, which yet takes no pride in its fidelity.

i remember more than my patience allows me to submit to construction for a history mattering to no one

i remember intimate years whose description i elide and years stained by the shadows of your body removed

i remember too much.

The best friend in this letter isn't the [one from my first letter](http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/gfp3q/a_long_unsent_letter_to_my_best_friend_just/)

The one from my first letter was my best friend friend in elementary school, in Junior high, and all the way from after high school graduation.

But for the 3 years of senior high, I barely saw him because we were in different schools. I had a new best friend for those 3 years, the one in this letter.

---------------------------
Hi,

Let me explain the situation, because if you ever read this letter, you would probably not understand where it's from.

We used to hung out in High School. I was in 5th year of school [In Québec, we only have 5 years) and you were in 3rd year. 

I was 16, almost 17, and you were 15 already. You were 18 months younger than me, but it didn't bother me because you were a lot more mature than even the senior girls.

I made you laugh, I made you think. You smiled when you saw me. You liked hanging with me and often, I dreamed that the whispers to your best friend when I was approaching where confessions of love toward me.

Her smile and discrete looks in my direction with wide eyes fueled my imagination.

About a week before my 17th birthday, I told my then best friend about my intentions to ask you out and a few hours later, I did.

You almost cried, admitting you would have loved to go out with me. That you indeed found me quite interesting.

But, you said, you had a new boyfriend you liked less but still, you couldn't dump him only a few minutes after agreeing to go out with him. 

You told me: ""As soon as we are done, him and I, I am going out with you""

I was confused, angry at my timing until I realized that your new boyfriend was my now ex-best friend.

To this day (yes, I am still in touch with him), he assures me that he didn't plan to stab me in the back.

He had his eyes on you for a while and simply wanted to know if he had a chance before I asked you out. He didn't really plan for you to say ""yes"" because he was convinced you wanted to go out with me.

In fact, he claims that he didn't really ask you out, he asked you if you would have considered to go out with him and out of his badly formed question you decided to go out with him.

You would have been my first girlfriend. You were his first girlfriend. A nerd never dumps his first girlfriend so you too dated until after graduation.

And so, I was stuck. I kept waiting for you and him to break-up and when I did learn you had broken up, I no longer had access to you.

But, somewhere, in the back of my mind, the idea that you would say yes to me if I ever found you stayed, fueling my imagination.

Every girl I met in college would be compared to you for a little while until I forgot your smile, you face and even your words.

I got myself a girlfriend and your name even left me, until she dumped me, 3 months later.

Then oddly, for a reason I could never understood, you came back in my mind. Maybe because you are hotter than my ex.

Except I was now 18. The images I had in my mind were that of a 15 year old girl.

Did that make me a pedophile for wanting a 15 year old girl? Never mind that you were now 17, the pictures in my mind of you never age because I never see you!

When I was 19, I got a new girlfriend, way hotter than even you ever were in my wildest imagination.

I married her. We had a daughter together. We are happy.

But from time to time, I think about you, and I have weird desires for you.

I long to caress your 15 year old body and I worry once again that I am a pedophile in one way or another.

But then, I question why I would want you when I am happy that I am with my wife.

And I realize that it's not the 20 or 30 something me that wants you. It's the 17 year old me, still hanging in there. Still wondering when he would get to date you.

My wife says that perhaps you didn't want to hurt me that day. Maybe you never wanted to really date me.

I believe her, but the 17 year old in me never does.

**And then, one day, I found your phone number.**

I didn't call right away. It took almost 1 month to admit to my wife I had found your phone number because the 30 something year old in me see no interest in calling you.

It's the 17 year old who wants answers.

And then  it took me another two months to actually call. What would I say? What would I ask?

You answered. You voice didn't echo anything in my mind. I couldn't recognize it. Perhaps age changed it or perhaps my memories are twisted.

Still, we talk. I get the confirmation you are the right girl. You remember my ex-best friend.

You remember high school.

But you have no idea of who I am. Zero. My name doesn't ring a bell. You have no recollection of who I am.

That day, the 17 year old in me finally died realizing that all his desires and waiting for you were a lie.

I never forgot any girl I ever had desire for. I may have forgotten a last name here or perhaps have the wrong first name, but if I ever spoke to one, I would have remembered her.

So, my question is, why did you say that the in high school? Why didn't you just tell me that you were not interested like all of the other girls I asked out until my ex said yes?

I miss you. I won't admit it to anyone and I'll deny it when asked, but I do. Overall I feel like I'm coping, but sometimes it just hits me, SMACK, right in the chest. I get all choked up as everything comes rushing back, the love, the passion, the fear and the hurt. 

You came over and I could see it in your body language, you wanted to break up. You wouldn't look at me, let alone touch me. You came in and said mean things like I don't love you, I don't want you anymore. When you finally met my eyes, I said one word: Bullshit. And I saw it, a crack in your armor. When you left, we hugged, and that's when your walls came crashing down. You did not let go of me for two hours as we sat there and cried. If that's not love, then I don't know what is.  

You used to say “I was made for you.” How I came into your life and changed what you thought you knew about life. It's true. I *made* you realize that you are capable of love and being loved. You are WORTH loving. I saw you for who you are, not what you pretend to be. I think that's what hurts the most. We'll see each other around and you won't even talk to me. The person I loved for so long pretends I don't exist. But we both know, you avoid me because I'll put a dent in the façade you are trying so hard to maintain. I see right into your heart and it scares, no it terrifies you.

I got through all your walls without you even noticing. When you realized how intimate our relationship had become, you panicked. I was too close and you were too vulnerable, and you needed to get me out, now. It saddens me to see your insecurities take over your life, and how unlovable you think you are. But I can't take down your walls at the same rate you put them up. 

The last thing you said to me was “trust yourself.” The thing is, if I look deep into my heart, I know you love me. You wanted freedom, so I gave it to you. But if I trust myself, I just know that you care, and one day you'll come back. But I also know it will take years for you to face this. So I'll admit it, part of my heart was waiting for you. How much longer will it wait? Not much. The battle between the immense hope I see in you and the hurt that weighs down my heart is becoming too hard for me to bear.

So, time is running out and I have tried, but I don’t have the energy anymore. 
I can’t love you, if you won’t let me.

I brought you here to show you a little about myself and tell you things you may have not known. I feel it’s only fair since I know much more about you than you know about me. 

This is the Charles River and that is my building. When I get stressed at work or when I get fed up with things I just look out that window over there, in the conference room and somehow I feel ok. The view is something so wonderful and beautiful how could I be to the contrary? If I look at this before leaving the office I will leave with a smile on my face. My goal in the next couple of years is to be able to name some of those buildings and streets and actually visit that area rather than fantasize about it :)

I don’t have to tell you my life story; I don’t have to tell you anything but somehow my gut tells me that this is the logical next step. Both of us are bottled up with emotions and have big issues with expressing them. I want to change that. What you told me Sunday night was empirical. Humans in general think emotionally and while language seems to be a great barrier in expressing them it’s a means to a solution. 

In elementary school I was the “teacher’s pet” I was not too popular in class but was loved by my teachers. In middle school everything went to hell, I got many things I wanted but was bullied by so many of my “friends.” High school started out weird. Freshman year I didn’t really make too many new friends. Sophomore year was interesting, I had some really great teachers and that was the year I met Doug. We hung out a ton… It wasn’t until senior year that I began to grow up. I signed up for AP classes went from a C student to an A student and made a ton of friends. Freshman year of college seemed like the appropriate segway after that, I started making friends; I started finding who I was. Suddenly, second semester I ended up in the hospital and at one point I was told that my situation was worsening. At that point all I wanted was for the doctors to leave me alone. Why work on someone that is hopeless… I told them and my parents to just let me die. I didn’t know better. For 2 years I lived in misery and depression. I kept telling myself my best friend was “Johnnie, Johnnie Walker.” I was lost. I knew I wanted things in life but could not find the means to achieve them. It wasn’t really until Doug pushed me into moving into this apartment that things started finally falling into place. I knew Doug and had met Carol but I didn’t know my 3rd roommate…hahaha The first night I spent in this apartment was interesting because for once I noticed a highly motivated, smart, and beautiful young woman. For some reason she felt safe with me, secure enough to tell me her biggest fears and her greatest desires. For some reason we were put together and somehow had this strong connection between us. I secretly had a crush on this person for a long time. Heck when I got back from India and she fell asleep next to me, I felt like I was given the best thing in the world. It wasn’t until one of my friends suggested I finally make a move that things changed. I don’t know what love is. I don’t understand many people but what I understand about myself is that when I am near this person I feel different. When we fell asleep together it felt like I could conquer the whole world. I ended up losing this person because we couldn’t communicate with each other. I’m not stupid, I know some chemistry exists between the two of us but it can get so frustrating when you lose all hope. For most people I guess they would move on but for me I tried harder because I wanted something, someone, more than anything else in the world. I ended up hurting the one person I literally cared about the most. I fucked everything up. All I want is that feeling that I can conquer the world back. 

I can’ tell you what to do, I can’t diagnose you like a doctor but when you have a headache I can kiss your head and hold you tight. And when you feel angry and stressed I can tell you that you are not alone. I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future but know that when I do things from now on, I usually know what I am getting myself into, you don’t need to lookout for me. You deserve whatever you want. Let no one, especially me, hold you back from that. ",,False,,t5_2seir,True,,,True,t3_gfpn3,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/gfpn3/love_letter_to_an_ex/,

All by yourself. It was one of those beautiful spring days, a little breeze just barely tapping our faces and the sun beaming down but not too hot. You said you’d come out there to work on Algebra, and sure enough, you had your math notebook, but I never once thought you were doing Algebra. Who hikes out to an empty rock overlooking a river with a gorgeous view of the mountain only to sit and do polynomials?

I think you were doing philosophy. I think you were doing meditation. After you died, Hamza, I thought about that day and couldn’t help but wonder what you knew deep down of life and death. Or perhaps of the uselessness of Algebra.

Or maybe it was simpler than that. Maybe you were staring up at the mountain, at your little oasis village perched up there, a green patch in a brown rocky abyss. Maybe you were debating whether you were being called to the big city or called to the countryside. All the while you were being called to the grave instead.

I never grieved for you, Hamza, because I don’t think I was ever given the chance to believe that you were dead. The desert is frozen in time in my head, the whole country the very same as it was the day I left it. And when I left, you were still alive, a happy-go-lucky eighteen year-old with the world ahead of himself. It’s hard to believe that could have changed, and I’ve sometimes wondered if I were to go back and see the rest of your family again, would the grieving come then?

Or maybe this is grieving. Maybe my way of grieving is remembering you sitting there on that red desert rock contemplating life and seeing myself in you. Maybe that's why you haven't died in some way, because I feel myself schlepping you around everywhere I go. 

And I'll try to continue to and hope I can live a tiny smidgen of the life I wish you could have had. ",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_1kjl90,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1kjl90/hamza/,

The truth is I’m feeling hurt but I don’t feel justified in feeling that way so I’m trying to separate myself a little not let myself continue to be so connected and get so hurt. I’m trying to work out some sort of balance where I feel connected but protected.

I truly value our friendship and I love spending time with you. I would put aside most things just to eek out a few minutes or hours to sit and chat with you. You make me feel fantastic. I know that our friendship has limits because of our spouses, as much as I find you wonderfully attractive and under different circumstances would love to jump your bones. I'm happily married and so are you. It's really hard for me to be your friend though because of how awkward it is to spend time with you. I can’t just call you up and ask you if you want to grab a beer solely because of my gender and your spouses jealousy issues. You’re the only opposite sex friend that I have this issue with. My spouse on the other hand could care less. So I’m reserved to asking only when your spouse isn’t in town and that makes it seem all the more shady. That being said I'm not sure if you don't go out much just to appease them or if it's your choice. Either way the constant rejection when I ask you to hang out is rough on me. I know we joke about it but it really is truly hurtful. You spend more time with my spouse than me and we are the ones who were originally friends. 

You ask me to be honest with you and act surprised/irritated when things are going on in my life that I didn’t tell you about but I find it hard to transfer information when we talk only a few hours a week. A lot goes on in our lives and you spend most of the time that we talk discussing your life, which I enjoy but it doesn’t leave much room for me. 

I don't call, ever, and you're probably wondering why. It's because of your spouse and the issues that our calls and texts caused a year ago. It's not that I don't want to talk to you, believe me I do, it's just that I don't want to cause trouble for you and I fear losing our friendship all together. I can't tell you about this because then you would know how I feel about your spouse and their issues and that puts you in a weird place too. 

Also things have been different, despite the fact that I told you nothing had changed, since you shared something that you weren’t supposed to. I had confided in you, which I really don’t do with anyone ever and you broke my trust. I have never had a friend that I could talk to and tell everything too, my spouse included. Even though I love them I try to shield them and not overload them with my shit. When we reconnected I was more honest with you than I’ve been with anyone ever but since you broke my trust I’ve lost that and it hurts so much. I desperately seek a friend who I can be open and honest with and who genuinely cares about me and what I have to say. I thought I had that with you, but I don’t. It’s unfair to blame you or put that on you but part of me mournes what I thought could have been.

Two last and totally petty things, it really hurt my feelings that you canceled plans at the last minute on the 4th and that you skipped hanging out with me on my birthday to go to the gym.

So there is your honesty. It’s not meant to be hurtful, just honest. Hopefully now that I’ve put all this out there I can move on. I still would like to be your friend and still love spending time with you but hopefully this gives you some perspective on where I’m coming from and how I’m feeling.

Even as I type this I'm crying while thinking of other ways to die. Last night, you threw me into a panic attack. I couldn't breathe. When I came to, the first thing I did was tie a cable around my throat. It didn't work obviously. Sadly I'm still here. And I don't know how to get out. I love you and I know you love me but were only ruining each other. We're not happy. You're lying if you say we are. But I think we both fear being alone. So instead we stick together; only to make each other more miserable. Maybe I'm Just fucked up but it's starting to feel like a game. You yell and scream and call me names and push me around.

I can feel it. And then what? What will be the next level of the game then? I fucked you up. I know that and I'm sorry for what I did. I take full responsibility for us being where we are now.

I probably have no right to say this, because I never had the balls to tell you I wanted more from you. I think you know I do though. And I think you just don't want more from me. Those are guesses, but I know you fairly well by now, and I'm pretty confident in those guesses.

I believed you when you said you were taking a break from dating, so I didn't push anything. You said you really needed a friend right now, and I was so excited to have met (re-met) someone that I was actually interested in knowing, that I was psyched enough with that. 

When we found out that we both are into kink, and in a compatible way, I was floored. We started dirty talking and it was so fucking sexy. You know exactly what I like to hear, and it was so exciting. Our communication was stellar, we were careful of boundaries, and I was just loving the journey. I got so scared when you said we'd have to stop in the fall so you could focus on school. I've become amazing at protecting myself from emotional pain, so I told you I understood, but we should stop right then, because it would be harder to end the longer it went on. I know I did this because I was scared, and I regret that. It's the kind of thing that I'm working on not doing because it limits me so much. 

Is it just me, or did you pull away a lot after that? We talk so much less now. I went away right after for a few weeks, but since I've returned we talk like half the amount. I'm always so terrified of pushing myself onto someone, but I've definitely taken the initiative here.

And now tonight, you casually mention that you're dating someone. Wow. Cool and everything, good for you, but whatever happened to taking a year off dating?? It's not like you met her and were so excited about the chemistry or whatever. You met her on a dating site. Why are you on a dating site if you were taking a year off dating? You don't owe it to me to keep me updated on everything going on in your life, but UGH. That's frustrating. 

Maybe you're just one of those people who changes their mind about shit all the time. I could see that, it wouldn't shock me. It's a character trait I deplore though, so that's too bad.

Anyway, I just needed to write this. I can't say this to you because I'm so sick of being that emotionally vulnerable girl that puts everything out there and gets hurt. I'm disappointed and frustrated and I have a first date tonight and I'm SO not in the mood. UGH.

I love you. So so much. And I miss you just as much. I'm incredibly grateful I had 13 months with you and I'll never forget what that was like. I want you to know that the last time I saw you, as I sang to you in your peaceful final sleep, I promised you I would always keep your brother safe and you should know I've been doing that very thing. And you have a new brother now, but I'm sure you've seen him from wherever you are. He reminded me so much of you when he was the same age. It hurt, but he helped me more then he will ever know. 

I also want you to know that what happened to you wasn't fair and I'm so, so sorry. You deserved to grow up, to know the world, you deserved to have a full life. The person that was responsible for you leaving too early is paying for what he's done and I know it still doesn't make up for it, but it's something. :( 

I know you watch over us, and I know you see how sad I am sometimes. Sometimes it only takes a second for everything to crash down around me. I try so hard, every day. Every single day can be a struggle. It always will be. Some days I can see the happiness that surrounds me, and other days I'm so alone and scared. My life will never be the same. It's affected every part of me. And sometimes to think about you, even for a second, hurts my heart more then anything ever could. I feel like my heart has been physically broken sometimes. I feel like there's a chunk of it missing, a piece of it I'll never get back. It hurts. I'm sorry if you ever see that, but it really has changed everything. Even the way I think. I trusted and at one point loved someone, and look what they did. They took something from me, from your brother and from you, that we can never get back.  I don't even know how to trust my own judgement at times now, because if I had of never let him into my life this wouldn't have happened. But... if I hadn't of let him into my life, I never would have known you or your brother. And I'm happy, even if it's hard to be, that I once held you in my arms. I put you on a potty. I fed you with your tiny little spoons. I bought you pretty little hats. I grew you inside of me for 9 months. I can't wish that never happened. 

Everything reminds me of you. Movies, songs, other little babies, innocent comments, your new little cousin. 

I try not to blame myself. In the back of my mind I have a million 'what ifs' that I fear will never go away. What if I ran away with the two of you, never looking back.

You deserve better.,why_am_i_mr_pink_,12,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1ibmla/my_dearest_baby_you_deserve_better/,"My sweet angel. You were brought to me on the 4th of July and god knows how you were ever able to be as perfectly healthy as you were. 

I didn't know you were with me until I was 4 1/2 months pregnant. I drank almost every weekend and smoked weed. Hurting that innocent brain and body of yours. When I saw you in the ultrasound, I broke down. I promised I would never hurt you again. I promised I would never let anyone hurt you and I thought nobody could take better care of you.

As I was going into labor, I selfishly took the epidural because the pain was too much. Your birth was as easy as it could have ever been. My sweet, healthy 7 lb baby. Your latch for breastfeeding was perfect despite the drugs I took during the delivery. Nothing was wrong with you and although I am not a Christian, I had to thank God for giving you mercy for your stupid mother's mistakes. 

Breastfeeding you is the best I can offer yet, I don't even give that my best. Blood and rips come and it's all my fault. 

Now as we go into our lives together, I'm wondering if adoption was the best option for you. Right now I can't ever imagine leaving you. My heart breaks at the idea of losing you, but what if you could have a better life somewhere else? I'm just a 19 year old. You don't deserve me as a mother. Yes, I am doing my absolute best, but what if that's not enough? What if I can't give you the best opportunities that are out there? And what if you could be better off with a couple who is married.. God, I can't. I can't give you up. I won't. I just wish I was in a better situation for you. I wish you didn't have to come into this part of my life where I am still depending on my medicated/ bipolar mother. We're leaving soon, to your daddy's house. But, what if that turns out to be just as terrible? Then where can I take you? 

You deserve better than this. You deserve a better mom.

You were the one that got away, you really were. And then, holy fuck, I get to see you again, and you tell me you've wanted to see me all this time too?

But no, you can't actually, y'know, *talk to me* once we started seriously flirting.

We talked about life and morality and reddit and all the things we wanted to do to each other. You said you'd teach me how to kiss.

But some 'asshole' switch flipped in your brain; I don't know how or when.

I should've known, ""We ought to chat"" was your way of saying ""We need to talk"". I mean, fuck, it's all synonyms. You sneaky bastard.

I was getting all excited, telling my friends that I might have a boyfriend, a crazy hot, funny, smart guy that wanted to cuddle and kiss and fuck me...

I was going to ask you to prom.

But you knew that already. Right after you told me you couldn't... couldn't *be* with me. Because you're... scared?

Jesus, fuck.

I still have those rubber ducks-- I don't know if you remember that birthday party, that one where I was the only girl you invited? Well, you gave little rubber ducks as party favors, and... Well, they've been sitting in my shower for 7 years.

What the hell is wrong with me?... god, I have been *pining* for you forever, and hating myself for it, just thinking how fucking insane I am for wanting so badly to meet you again... and then you go and validate all of that, you tell me all these sweet things...

I can't believe that you were lying when you said all that. I just can't.

I believe that you were scared. Scared of hurting me, of fucking me up.

I also believe, however, that you are the biggest pussy on the planet and you made a huge mistake.

I don't even need to send this, because I've made all these feelings clear to you already. I've been so honest and forthcoming about all of this because I thought that's what you *do* in an adult relationship.

I thought you were doing that, too.

But I guess your brain was just going too fast for your mouth to keep up... I just wanted you to talk to me... You went and got all anxious on your own...

I hate waiting for you. I despise it.

But I'll keep doing it, because it's all I know how to do.

Don't get me wrong-- I'm gonna date other guys. But I won't forget you. And in a year, when we're both here for summer again, I'll call you. Please, be ready for me by then.

A girl, holding him and believing him. ""Will you promise to be my boyfriend forever?"" ""No, I can't..."" ""Why not?"" ""Ring things. But I can promise that I'll love you forever.""

Later, ""I can still love you as a friend. Hahaha."" Now, it isn't even that. A girl, alone, loved by many people but not the one she wanted to spend her life with. A girl, wanting to die and thinking of the one person she gave her all to. A girl, writing this and knowing you could find it if you wanted to. You don't want to. You don't care anymore.

A girl, wanting to let this out but not wanting to bother you. Sometimes I just want you back. It's been a few months, I'm getting stronger, but my logic won't triumph over my emotions. I know that you're wrong for me, that we will never have a future together, and that it is better off this way but my heart says ""Come back to me, please. At least say my name. At least give me a few words."" 

Listening to fireworks and remembering how kissing you didn't give me fireworks like in those dramas, but kissing you made me smile because you enjoyed it and you loved doing it and your sounds as we hugged and did more. It wasn't a fairytale. It wasn't beautiful beyond reason. It was raw, realistically lovely. You smelled like a human, our kisses were messy, sometimes I felt like shit even when you were around, sometimes I doubted my love for you, you even annoyed me at times, but I still loved you. I still do love you. Maybe not in a desperate way anymore, but I will always have this place in my heart for you.

It's been really tense all month, between us, and between me and all my other friends. All I feel is annoyed and worried. Sometimes I love you, and sometimes, you're cranky because of your jobs or just life in general and I feel like a horrible person because it seems like many of the things I do annoy you. I think I was a very different person when we met; more into the little things that make life happy, more outgoing and excited for life. My plans for the future have reduced greatly since then if I were to look at it from old me's point of view. Maybe that's why we're not in love anymore. And with the complications we'll be going through in the next year, I don't feel like hanging onto you is worth it.

Will update later tonight. 

Edit: Hi. Maybe I should be asleep. But I've got lots of things in my mind now. 

My self confidence has gone down lower than it's been for a while. I haven't felt this bad about myself since fifteen moths ago when I was pretty much losing my mind over everything. I don't have a single close friend other than you and the girl from my dorm that is many hours away right now. I think I care for lots of people, but I'm not close to any of them because I can't open myself up to them. Even when they ask how I am, I shut them out. This would be less of a problem between us since I can trust you to not judge and to help me sort out my feelings, but you're the same as me right now; closed and sarcastic and refusing to show much emotion. 

If I could I would give you all the time and money you need to be able to travel around while writing your first novel, because I loved you more when you still wrote. I bet you think the same about me. Oh love, if only we could just write and make music and art for years. I miss that so much. Sometimes your lack of creativity makes me think you might be depressed, but you are sure you aren't. 

Is it possible to love someone to bits and still dislike being near them? You, all my friends, my family, even my coworkers to extent, you're all wonderful beautiful people but you all make me so stressed and upset and angry. I just feel mad at everyone. I don't even know if I want to leave you, love, I don't know what to do at all.

If I were able to, I would let you go. I would forget about you and let you move on and let myself move on. Like everyone else who says ""lets be friends,"" we would become strangers. In passing, we'd be cordial, of course, and we'd pretend we wanted to catch up. We'd make plans and never follow through, we'd make half-hearted promises, we'd forget each other. And that would be okay. Except I don't think I can't do that. I can't bring myself to abandon you because you don't want to be in a relationship. I know you need someone. Maybe I'm just being pretentious and self-absorbed, maybe I have an overblown sense of my ability to help others, but maybe you need me.

If we were in a movie, you would fall for me. Every time I was there for you when no one else was, you would slip a little further. Every time I smiled, you would notice that I am beautiful; every time I listened and helped you would remember why you think I'm such a good person. We would be inseparable, those two people who are ""just friends"" but everyone knows are really more than that. Eventually you'd tell me you were wrong to reject me, that you just weren't ready, that you cared for me and you always had and always would. I would love that. Except we're not in a movie. And I respect that you're not interested, and that you have the right to reject me. I'm beginning to see that I'm wonderful, but even with that I know I may not be what you need or just what you want.

In real life, it will go a little bit like this: we'll have to force awkward conversation first. I'll have to initiate, because you know it would be callow and mean of you to push before I've healed. We'll stumble along and say the wrong things: I'll say too much and you'll say too little and I'll blush when I remember how we used to be and you'll laugh uncomfortably. We'll remember why we want to be friends, and it will get better. I'll be there for you on those days when you hurt for no reason and try to stop hating yourself, and you'll keep me on the ground when I want to fly away. One of these days, I'll be over my feelings for you. Eventually I'll fall for other boys and hopefully you'll heal enough to fall for other girls. It'll break my heart a little, again, the first girl I see you dating. I don't know how you'll feel if I get a boyfriend. Maybe I'll always want you to be a little jealous. Maybe I'll always want you to realize we should be together.

Regardless, our lives aren't some Taylor Swift song or a rom-com about the two socially awkward college students who fell in love. The chances of us ever being together are slim-to-none. On the other hand, though, I can't force myself to throw away your friendship just because I developed feelings and you don't reciprocate them. So we'll be friends. Just friends, not ""just friends."" And we're gonna be okay. Okay?

Yet; I'd rather begin this letter by telling you that you truly are not a nice person. I was taught by my family and now several years after our relationship imploded violently, my new friends and partner, that if you don't have anything good to say, don't say anything at all. But letting you know that you are not nice is honestly the most positive way to describe everything. 

Over the course of our relationship that spanned 3 years, you managed to isolate me from all my friends, destroy me financially, jeopardize my health, question my mental stability and tarnish any notion on what I believed was 'love'. I honestly believed that what had happened to us was entirely my fault, but after re-building myself from the shattered lows that a human being can find themselves, I realised that that was completely wrong. 

Now, I must express that what I will say next might seem to contradict what I said earlier about '...if you can't say anything good', but this needs to be said. You need help. You have a list of issues that need to be addressed. Here we go; You are racist, confounding, irrational, ignorant, homophobic, self-obsessed, insanely short-tempered, drug addicted, criminally fraudulent and a borderline hoarder. At first in our relationship I ignored everything because I believed what we had was 'love', but really I was blinded by lust and wasn't thinking clearly. And towards the end of our relationship I needed to leave because of such a brooding unhappiness that I became a former shell of who I was, depressed on thinking that I was trapped with our relationship within the house that we had purchased. 

The legal process was traumatic and I was rendered homeless for  years, and the harassment from you and your family on top of this was just unscrupulous. Yet, I found myself again, and I became the man I am truly proud of. Someone that I can be proud to display to the world, and persevered to see the greener pastures after the intensive hurdles linked with the legalities of real estate. Though, I'm glad that you managed to keep the house with your financial partner.

So, years have passed and I feel like you need to know that the character you possess is one that is fatally flawed, but it can still be redeemed (and I don't mean that in a moral way through religion, but rather through self-reflection). And I hope that someday you find someone who is your better-half, and that you treat them correctly.

It has been an entire year and some change since I've been in your class. In that time, I went to the art school of my dreams, dropped out and started over. But I don't think I could've gotten in without you pushing me. People may bitch and moan about English classes but yours was truly the best. You're sarcastic and wonderful. Even though you snark at people and keep everyone at arm's length you can inspire as well. You did that for me. You read every goddamn screenplay I wrote, even the shittiest ones. You were my mentor. My Dr. Cox. I think that's what made class so perfect. Because, as you know, in high school, I liked to see certain aspects of my life in Scrubs terms. Mom got sick the second year I had your class and unlike many of my teachers I could talk to you about it without it getting uncomfortable. I probably wouldn't be half the writer I am today without you. I always think about going back and visiting you. But to be honest, it's a tough thing for me. I left a lot of things back there. My mom lost her second battle with cancer during my freshman year of college. I didn't even get to see her. I found out she passed from a text that said ""Sorry for your loss"" from a neighbor. When the last time I had seen her was maybe a day or two before. I should've gotten a call from her husband who had married her a week before her death. But he never contacted me or returned my calls. We saw each other last at her wake. It has not been an easy year and contributed a lot to me dealing with a ""quarter life crisis"" and leaving school to pursue other interests I've found over the year and a half I spent there. I do not regret my decision. I know she only wants my happiness and I intend to give her that wish. I'm starting a webcomic and working on illustration in general. So I guess that's it for now. I just wanted to update you on my life. And tell you that a lot of this was because I thought back to the lessons you taught me through the years I had the privilege of taking your class. Maybe our paths will cross again someday. Maybe I'll get the courage to go back. But for now. I just want to say thank you for everything and I wish you the best in life.

Look what you did. 

I know you couldn't have changed it if you wanted to, but come on. How could you leave me here like this? Everyone is going crazy now. Mom is getting Aunt Aly involved in every little thing and I think they're about to do something bad. I miss you a lot and nobody seems to be getting that. Rick misses you too. You were so influential to him and all Mom can do is keep discrediting it like he's some kind of little bug or something. I need you to be here. I need my daddy. I need someone to make things okay in this family again.

Mom,

You need to open your fucking eyes. Aunt Aly has always played head games with this kind of shit and you know it. Last week she was fighting with Aunt Zuza about money they weren't even supposed to be splitting up, and before that she made Aunt Zuza pay an absurd amount of rent each month so she could finish her basement. SHE IS USING YOU. You can't even see it because you're latching onto anyone who will give you any sort of attention. She's not your friend. She's your sister who has fucked you over so many times before, fucked over everyone else in her life, and is like a little vulture when it comes to deaths in the family. She makes sure she sucks everyone dry and gets everything to herself. Watch your back with this bitch is all I'm saying, even though I know you won't listen. You've really shown who you are these past few weeks and honestly, I'm not so sure I like you without Daddy.

Aunt Aly,

""I would gladly spend the rest of my life in a fuck-me-in-the-ass federal prison in exchange for the privilege of reducing you to your component parts."" I read that somewhere on this damn website recently, and I feel that way towards you. You're a sociopath, I'm convinced. Your Stockholm Syndrome daughter Ella isn't the kindest either, and frankly I'm pretty positive I wouldn't have to deal with half the shit I do in terms of my own mental health. You contributed to my depression, my eating disorder, and my past 2 suicide attempts, and I'll be fucked if you're not contributing to this one too. You are the most disgusting piece of shit human being I have ever met in my life, and I know you're up to something. I know you're fucking with people and their feelings. You like to talk about how you don't take shit from anyone because you were beaten by your ex-boyfriend. ""A 6 foot man beat the fuck out of me, I don't take shit from anyone! Fuck you! I'm not used to having a 14 year old boy tell me to fuck off,"" was what you told me when I stuck up for my younger brother. Here's the thing, Aly. I've had the shit beaten out of me by a 6 foot man too, and I've beaten him right back. I don't know who I'm fucking with? Haha, okay. Try me, cunt. 

To everyone else,

I'll kindly direct your attention to this letter when I'm sitting in my own hospital bed instead of going every week to visit my dad in his. This is about control. It's not about food, it's not about how many calories it has, it's not about being skinny, it's not about anything other than control. You have all taken away all control over every other aspect of my life - my room, my clothes, my car, my school, my hairstyle, when my boyfriend can see me, EVERYTHING. The reason I've ended up here is because you all couldn't see that the reason I was struggling was because people were making decisions for me when I should have made them for myself. People who shouldn't have been making those decisions, were. It's been building for years and frankly, I'm almost happy about this. You're all reading this while I'm a bag of bones in a hospital bed, and now I'm the one on top.

You broke up with me...but **you** wanted to spend the next 3 weeks as if we *didn't* break up. I stayed in your parents' house...I met your parents...I met all your relatives...I met your animals...I met your friends...I ate your parents' food...I met your coworkers...I celebrated Christmas away from *my* family to spend it with *yours*...your parents bought me Christmas gifts...and then I flew back home...to nothingness...your parents' gifts are in the back of my closet...You did this...and I blame myself...against your best wishes...

But how can I not blame myself? I did everything for you. I kept smiling for you. I told you, all the time, that everything's going to be fine. You still hated the distance. I did everything I could to make it easy for you. I fought to keep any toxic thoughts to enter your mind...but I failed...they entered...and did their damage...and I'm to pay for it...with true heartbreak.

They say true loss comes from when you love something/someone more than you loved yourself...consider this one of the truest losses I've ever faced.

You're amazing. You're gorgeous. You're sexy. You're smart. You love all the things I wish I knew more about. 

We were best friends for 8 years...I remember the very moment that we met...I think back to high school, and it's all you...either you...or my knee injury...the knee injury you were the cause of...the knee injury that reminds me every single day of its presence...The numbness of a surgery scar...

After I got back home, I was in denial. We're just taking a break. It won't be long until we get back together...everything will be fine in a couple weeks...in a month...in a couple months...you tell me to leave you alone...on Valentine's Day...because I,in my denial, was all ""HERPDERP LET'S BE VALENTINES""...Oh someone asked you out at work? Yeah, just tell Facebook...I texted you...I made you cry...I left you alone....

4 months later...and you're probably doing fantastically...I wouldn't know...Facebook's in the past...no mutual friends that I talk to...but knowing you...little miss compartmentalization...you're doing just fucking fine...and I...I work...I write music...I go out with friends...I see a therapist on the weekly....I jog...I work out...I can't cry...I can only build up a rage...

I can't dwell. I know everything that I *should* do. I know everything that I *need* to do. I know what's *logical* but my heart isn't ready to say goodbye to you.

I shared a dream with my therapist. The mall represents my life..and the individual stores represent chapters of my life...in the first dream, you're in a store and I'm telling you to hurry up because we got to see the rest of the mall...but you want to stay in this one store for a little longer...the second dream...we're walking along the mall and you're yelling at me. I just don't want to let you in a store because we got to get to the other end of the mall. You're yelling at me and you're mad at me. I just want to walk the length of the mall with you...and you won't let me.

But you're not in my head. I'm in my head. You didn't make me fall madly and deeply in love with you. I chose to fall madly and deeply in love with you. You didn't force me to want you to be Mrs. Stuckonthemonkeybars. I decided, on my own, to want that.

In order for me to move on to the next chapter of my life, I have to let you go. I have to say goodbye. But what if I'm abandoning...you?...me? Why am I so scared of letting you go? 

It kills you to know that I didn't 'learn' anything when we were together? Well, I was falling for you. I didn't have time to 'learn' anything...but now I know...I've learned everything you wanted me to learn. Yes, it's bargaining.

I know you won't, although you can find it easily if you wanted to. You know what my username is, and you know that I use reddit quite often, but you won't read this, and I am absolutely sure of that. 

I guess that I'm writing this for some closure and to format my thoughts before I talk to you. I need to get it out of my mind and onto some form of writing so I can actually be coordinated when I try and talk to you about everything that's happened. 

I haven't had any close friends before I met you, it's strange I know but I was introverted and really didn't feel like making friends. This changed when I met you. You practically forced me to become friends with you, and for that I am grateful. Because of you, I have people that I care about and people who I can trust. However, you were and still are my closest friend, even if you're currently drifting away from me. 

I didn't stay friends with you because I had feelings for you like many people thought. In fact I considered us as simply friends for a while. However I found that as we spent more time together, as I spent minutes, hours, days, even weeks in your presence I found that I did have feelings for you. I found that you had taken a knife with your name on it and stabbed me in the heart with it. Everytime I saw you, that knife would push in a little deeper. Every time I heard your laugh, listened to your voice, or recognized your smile, the knife would twist sharply into my heart. 

I never told you about this though. I didn't want to ruin our friendship. I observed as suitor after lovestruck suitor was turned away with a smile and a quick no. I didn't want you to push me away like that, I didn't want you to cut off our friendship. You found out anyways, but it was a subtle recognition that you thankfully never called me out on. We continued to be friends and you leaned on me even more as a confidant. 

It was around this time that one of your suitors actually managed to make you feel something. When you told me, I was crushed. I felt my desires shatter like fragile stained glass, and while you talked to me about how strange you felt, I picked up all my feelings and tried to keep calm. Your new beau made me realize that I could never make you feel that way, and that I could never be with you like you wanted to be with him. 

You told me that you were ""Happier than you ever felt in a long time"" and that he ""made your heart race and your face flush."" Every word that you said was a stab into my heart. Every breathless sigh you exhaled made me wither on the inside. I couldn't respond properly to whatever you said during that time so I merely listened and let your voice wrap around me. I found some small comfort in that. 

You noticed that I was upset, as you normally do in your piercing way. This entire situation came at a bad time, another friend of mine and I recently had a falling out, so I was harsher than I should have been to you. You asked me what was wrong, asked if the situation between you and him was upsetting me. That sentence rushed over me and made me feel alive again, to know that you cared about me made me feel better than any drug could ever made me feel. 

Then you told me that I could talk to you about it, that you valued my friendship. With that, you made me remember why I obsessed about you, why I fell in love with you, why I stayed up waiting for you to text back. 

I don't know where I go from here though, you've been growing more distant from me since then. Your new lover doesn't like me very much I know that but if he makes you happy, if he completes you in a way that I can't then I want you to be with him, if it also requires me to go away and merely watch you from a distance then I will even if it splits me inside. I only ever want you to be happy.

There is a lot of pent up stuff that needs to be let out. This week is the last week i'll talk to you for a long time. I'm going to prom with you and then its over. I know you love still being friends with me but its getting too hard for me.

Something has changed with you. The girl I knew just a year ago was happy and energetic and willing to do new and exciting things. You weren't afraid to wear what you wanted and what was comfortable. You wanted to go places and explore you were excited about going away to college. 

A year later everything has changed. You are now obsessed about modesty. When I saw you yesterday you didn't look comfortable in 85 degree weather wearing a two dark shirts and a black skirt and leggings. You no longer wear comfortable clothing because you are afraid it isn't modest and that you are sinning because its your fault that wearing shorts and pants make a man have lustful thoughts about you? I don't get your new 
views on religion, I wish I did but i don't. You've gone from being excited to go away to college to turning into a person scared to leave the security of her family and church and you've become a commuter to the local college. 

I'm glad you want to still remain friends but I still have feelings for you. Feelings that you will never reciprocate, not anymore. I loved you. Our friendship isn't truthful on my end. I need to stop talking to you, seeing you and everything else. I don't think you know how hard it is going to be for me to stop. It breaks my heart to do it. You make me happy and sad at the same time. Hopefully after some time away, I don't know how long, I can be real friends with you. I hope you understand and I hope you can find someone to love you who can understand you better than I ever could.

When you kissed me goodbye in August I fell asleep. That’s the last moment I remember. I remember the look of love on your face, the desperate clinging to each moment, the incredible feeling of your soft lips on mine, the tears, and the reassurance that we’d be fine. I remember each beautiful strand of blue in your amazing eyes, the warmth and comfort found in your arms, and your calming sent. Your voice that awakened something so deep in me I never knew existed. The fear of losing you was like a dull ache, but the fear of losing myself was what drove me mad. 

Somehow I fell asleep and wouldn’t wake up for another seven months. 

I remember waking up. It was literally a deep breath of fresh air. My head was cloudy and confused. I remember smiling and my body letting out a sigh of relief. All the tense discomfort of seven months seemed to fade in one moment and I couldn’t help but laugh. I felt like myself again. 

I was allowed to go home and I started living again. I gained back all the weight I lost, I sang and laughed and smiled very frequently, and I felt light. I felt like dancing and celebrating. I wanted to go crazy and scream and run wild. After seven months, I was finally myself again. I was alive.

Then the memories came back. I reread text messages in horror; replayed events in my mind feeling appalled. Surely this person from these memories does not exist… Surely I’ve never known her.

In anguish, I realized the truth. That monster… she was I all along. All that time I felt like I was asleep and I let a monster take over, it was a lie. I knew what I was doing all along. Depression, immaturity, insecurities, intense emotions: none of these are excuses. 

I had my reasons at the time, but looking back I’m horrified at how I acted. I’m beyond embarrassed and honestly ashamed at the way I treated you. You didn’t deserve that. You’re an incredible person and it kills me to realize what I put you through. 

I’m sorry for changing on you. I’m sorry for taking all of my pain and frustration out on you. I’m sorry I didn’t trust you. Above all, I’m sorry for hurting you.

I know you’ve said before that I don’t need to apologize, but I feel like I do. 

My pain and regrets aside, all I want is for you to be happy. I wish I could talk to you about all of this. I wish I could figure out what you want. I don’t know if I should go away and leave you alone forever or continue a casual friendship. 

Four months later and you’re still on my mind every day. I still want you more than anything and still love you more than life itself. 

I wish I could talk to you. I wish I could feel your warm embrace and see that happy light in your eyes. But I blew it and it’s too late now. I know that.

I want you to know that I’m better now and I want you to be happy in every way, shape, and form. I value your happiness above my own, so if you’re fine without me I’ll disappear. 

I meant it when I said I’ll always love you. The intensity will fade over time, but I will never stop loving you.

I spent so much time and effort on you, looking past my wants and needs to make sure you were happy.

How am I selfish? My entire existence was...and still is...devoted to you! I confess I was a bit clingy...you would be too, though, if you spent your whole life not knowing love. It's true that you've never known true love in this life....but I've never known any form of love until you came along.

I guess I was like your third husband in that regard...you said you left him because he needed you too much, after all. Did I just remind you too much of him?

I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I love you.

But I just. Can't. Help it &gt;.&lt;

I've tried to move on, really I have...but my heart just can't deny that you were that One, that special soulmate. Without you....I'm nothing. We've even previous history: you yourself are the one who remembered me when we first met.

You were my best friend for years. I hated you so much sometimes, you were a manipulative little brat who consistently put me down but I still loved you. You made me laugh more than anyone else, despite all the emotional pain you caused me, and all the shame you made me feel.

I put up with the fact that, through the first few years of high school, you literally pissed yourself every day because you had a bladder problem and your single dad didn't know how to help you. Thanks to you, we were *both* labelled the smelly kids even though I was perfectly fine and you were the one that had no bladder control. I put up with that, because I loved you. You were my best friend. 

You made me walk through a graveyard in the middle of the night on my own, even though you knew I was deathly afraid of the dark and couldn't cope with anything like that. You threatened me, and laughed at me all the way home. I locked myself in the toilet at your grandparents' house and cried as you laughed and laughed and laughed. I told you I hated you for making me do that. You told your grandparents that I'd said I hated you, and they shouted at me. I put up with that, because I loved you. You were my best friend. 

When you made us walk across that flooded river when we were 13 and told your grandparents I'd forced you to do it, I forgave you. You were my best friend and I was an idiot and I loved you to bits. 

I remember when your grandmother, your poor dad's mum, was dying and you threw a temper tantrum because he said I couldn't stay over because he was too busy *looking after his dying mother* I just sat back and cringed and wanted to go home. That poor bastard finally asked me to stay to shut you up. I felt so sorry for him, I was so embarrassed and ashamed, and I really hated you then. 

Your mother died of cancer when you were 5. That is, of course, heartbreaking and I felt so sad for you every day. I never stopped thinking about it. But you used your mother's death as a way to manipulate people. You knew your grandparents and your father were fighting over you and you played along. You got everything you wanted. You got everything *I* wanted, just because you knew you could get it and I couldn't. I remember when I wanted a parrot, so your grandparents bought you a parrot. I remember when I wanted to buy a beautiful gothic dress but couldn't afford it, you stole your dad's money and bought it for yourself. Why the fuck did I forgive you for that?

You slowly drifted apart from me. You started spending time with pretty, popular girls. I was too boring for you, I spent far too much time trying hard in school and you just wanted to fuck everyone. I remember the day you got bullied and you told your new friends all about it, but not me. My heart broke that day. The bitch I put up with for all those years didn't need me anymore. I cried so much. I never knew a friend could break my heart. 

I've heard so much about you over the past 6 years, since we stopped being friends. I heard you got engaged to a criminal who threatened to kill your dad. I saw your Facebook picture of you and him posing with guns. You abandoned your poor, lonely dad. He'd spent every penny he earned on spoiling you and he had nothing for himself. And then you got fucking *engaged* to a man who threatened to kill him. 

You walked past me in the street one day when I was 18 and we had a brief hello. I cried all night. 

Well, it's been 6 years since we properly talked, and today I got a call from my mum. You turned 21, so you got your mother's inheritance. Your mother who died of cancer when you were 5. You got £82,000. If I had that amount of money I would pay off my student loans and take my sister to America. We've dreamed about going to Arizona for years. But you absolute scum piece of shit spent it on ""perfume, drugs and clothing"". You, Sarah, are a cunt stain. 

If you remember anything about me, hopefully it's that I wouldn't wish anything bad on anyone. But you. I absolutely loathe you. I feel so horrible for your dad and your grandparents, but they are to blame for how you turned out. You spoilt, manipulative, one-upping, disgusting excuse for a living organism. You are the most vile human being and I hate you. I really fucking hate you.

You have no idea how much it means to me that you remembered your old childhood best friend and spent the time and effort to find me and get back in contact with me. I loved you then, and I love you now. You're beautiful and I can't wait to keep on re-meeting you.

Read-
You've been my best friend for around two years now, and you know the most about me over anybody. You've been there for me through everything and you've helped me with everything I need help with, even though I hate admitting that I can't do it on my own. It doesn't even matter that we've never met face to face, I'm closer to you than practically anybody I'm physically around. You're like a brother to me, and I love you.

Tori-
What happened? We were best friends, man. For forever. I don't know what changed.. All the inside jokes we used to share, all the conversations-through-looks, how we had the same sense of humor.. I miss it, and I miss you. We went through so much together, some good, some bad, but we never had any arguments, ever.

Erica-
I love you, and I'm going to miss you so much when you move. I can't even get the words out.

Shannon-
You're such a happy person it's crazy, and I'm not used to being around people like that. But you've seriously been such a positive influence on my life and I'm proud to say you're my friend.

Kailey-
You're the one that talked to me when my relationship with Sam went rocky, and you helped me a lot. I hope I can do the same for you, and have a positive impact on your life.

Sam-
Oh my God, Sam. I miss you so much. I know we were only together for ten months, but I loved you with everything I had. I still do love you, but I can't say it's a complete love anymore. We were an unstable couple, and we brought out the instability in each other. It was an unhealthy relationship, and I hurt you. I'm so sorry for everything I did wrong, and I just want to make it up to you. I want to talk to you so bad, but I won't let myself. It's immature, but I want you to be the one to reach out to me for once. I just want to hug you, at least one more time.

Ana (for those not knowing what Ana stands for, it's short for Anorexia)-
Fuck you. You ruined my life. You are not my friend; you are my disease. I have dealt with you for too long. I hate you. You are a sickness; you are my sickness. You are my home, and I fucking love it.

Me-
Zoe.. I'm so proud of you for finally trying to get better. You've accepted the fact that you are broken and fixable, and you're doing something about it. I know it's hard, especially since you've been living with all of this since you were really little, but it will be okay. You're not as suicidal as you were, and that's a damn amazing accomplishment for you. Your depression is getting better. You're finally dealing with the trauma you've suffered through since you were six. You called your father out on his bullshit, and finally reported him. You're talking about what you have problems with. You haven't self mutilated in months now. You're learning to be comfortable in your own skin. It's a hard battle, but it's one worth fighting. Relapses have happened, and realistically will continue to happen, but you will see it through to the end. Your sentence will be a long one.

Readers, if any-
You are beautiful, inside and out. Whatever you're dealing with right now, be it depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, self harm, eating disorders, any type of addiction, a broken heart, and type of grief or loss, abuse, neglect, anything, you will get through it.

I know it would only ever lead to pain, at this point in our lives anyway. But sometimes when we fall asleep together I realise how much I miss your closeness and your warmth and your scent, oh god...


I just always want to be near you. When we fall asleep together it hurts when I wake up because I realise that we can't be together, despite the lingering gazes and slightly too long embraces.


But those moments where I'm between awake and asleep are the best, because I don't remember of any of our problems and all I know of the world yet for that day is that you and I are together and you're warm and I put my head on your chest and you hold my hand and we mumble half asleep musings and you kiss the top of my head... but then we go and reality kicks in and it drags my heart down that we can't do this. Not now anyway.


I want us to end up together. But I'm scared of getting caught up in the world outside our bubble. When the time finally comes what if you'll have forgotten or I'll have forgotten and all that we'll end up to each other is a faint memory of the scent on a pillowcase.

I wanted to tell you that it doesn't matter if I met someone else, it doesn't matter if I spend my days talking to her, because I still think about you. 

Since we're not talking right now, I just wanted to tell you that I still think about you. It's dumb, because I'm always the type of person who chases after what I can't have. And after I've gotten it, I get bored. The game has been won, and most of the time it's too easy. 

The night that I met her, my friends and I went to a dance. She was there, with her own friends. There was a dancing competition that I entered in. I won my first round (the announcer called me ""Kicks"", which I thought was funny), and my second round was against *her*. Well, her and this other guy. Neither of us won that round, but we talked afterward, danced on our own. And she is quite possibly one of the loveliest creatures I have ever seen. 

I feel bad for writing this, but I wanted you to know. I wanted you to know that I still think about you, that I still care about you. It's been nearly a month since you've contacted me in some way. Am I allowed to text you in the mornings and hope you have a good day? Am I allowed to try and remember what your voice sounded like, the way that you smiled? 

Even through meeting people, I do still think about you. I wish I could tell you that I haven't really hurt myself in almost a month now. I wish I could tell you that even my biggest scar is fading, after about six months. I wish I could run towards you and jump into your arms. I wish that those arms would be open, instead of closed like I know they are right now.

I cried about what you said. 

And then I let go of my crying and thought about what you said, and I mean really thought. In my other letter I asked you to give me until August. I won't change that: it's one last chance for me to see you before we both leave. That is, if you're willing. 

I know I've put you through hell. I'm fickle, I change my mind about people, I'm temperamental when it comes to relationships. Hell, the last time I was actually in a relationship that lasted longer than a month was over a year ago. Since then I've said fuck that, wait til next year.

Due to weaknesses borne of either of our faults, though I never let them ""get in the way"" and ruin a friendship I wanted to believe in.  Still would like to believe in.  But your nature and ""track history"" as I understand it, strongly suggest this is repetitious behavior and that it will manifest again, with me or any of your other ""friends.""

I would love to define ""friendship"" for you, as only you must undoubtedly understand it.  A friend is: Useful to me, for my means and amusement, until they are proven too limited or too irritating that they must be given ""the silent treatment.""  Let THEM crawl back to you.  You shall not spare consideration; you shall never yield myself to compassionate understanding; and, above all else, you shall never apologize - because it never dawns upon you that your shortness of temper is, too, a cause to friction.

Yes, I know I have a tendency to be forgetful; I know I am not the funniest, most riveting conversationalist; and, I am well aware that my personal, at-home situation isn't the best or healthiest of situations, but that's being dealt with.  I know all of this.  Do you know that I regard you as my dearest, most important friend?  I have cause to re-evaluate those feelings, now.  Do you know that, in all likelihood, after you've driven away all of your other would-be friends and relationship ties, I'll still be there, faithful till comes doomsday?  Because, I will.

I'm sorry that I had to move, that we had to be separated by time and distance.  I'm sorry, too, that you and ""your ways"" ostracized you from your only real-life friends, save for one that you yourself will surely do away with before too long.  I'm sorry that you need to relegate your life to an exchange of online messaging in thought-arenas of gaming-related environments, communicating in third-person descriptions of thought flowing into action; a negotiation of numbers versus numbers; and, of course, acting as a referee to your circle of fellows.  But, they are not friends to you.  Their only value to you lies so far as their willingness to game with you.

In a perfect world, I would've indulged you.  I would've wanted to ask you out, or I would've spent more time walking you to or from work, and I would've been content to call it a friendship.  Of course, here we are, again: I disappointed or annoyed you in some largely unimportant way, and you hide from me in chat, the e-mails stop, and the text messaging also halts.  Because... I don't measure up to our intellectual games of amusement?

I often witness, and realize, how you haven't matured out of your childish behaviorism.  Your knee-jerk reactions to make me pause and think: Good LORD, did that just come from you?  You might be well educated, and you might have an admirable work ethic, but I realize you can be all those things and still not be an intelligent, reasonable person.  Anyone can work like a robot, hard and long.  Anyone can study and push themselves to accomplish.  But, friendships and inter-personal stuff like that... That requires a special sort of circumnavigation.  And you lack the compass.

I ask myself: Why? Why should I hang around and wait on the hope that you'll realize you're being a little hard?  That maybe, I am hurt by these actions of yours?  That, when I go without our usual pleasant exchanges... I don't know what to do with myself, in my restlessness?

I used to love, just love, the sight of you; the warmth of your smile, and the welcoming tone in your greeting.  That one, and last, day we had together, last year, with the errands and the movie... Our longest day together, and I wished it wouldn't end.  Because, when it ended, I had to move.

So what if we're friends, and that I want to love you, and that I might not measure up to your standards... I want to be your friend first, and I will prove that I can still be that, even when you're at your worst.  Because, you beautiful dolt, I won't ever abandon you.  That goes beyond friendship, inches past love, and if that makes me dumber still for wanting to stick around in a semi-friendship where the ice is thin and there are traps all around, then so be it.

I'm sorry though. I know we're just friends, but I can't help it. You're the nicest guy I've met. You're always helping someone out, or making them smile when they feel shitty.

It's been six months since we last spoke.  Six months since you returned the ring that I excitedly bought you and nervously got down on one knee to give you. Six months since there was light in my life.  

I think of you everday, I wish I could stop, I truly wish I could quit.  In the morning I wonder what you'll be wearing, how your hair will look and what perfume you'll have on?  By mid-day I'm hoping work is going well and your customers are sweet.  In between I think about the good times, the bad times and what I could have done differently.  By now I've replayed countless interactions and am telling my self that not writing you, calling you, will somehow bring you back to me.  Every thought of you is both a joyous reminder of the best of anything I've ever had and a dagger stabbing me every which way.

You once told me that you were worried about me. Worried that you would one day get a call that would tell you that I wasn't there anymore - that I'd left this world to go to the next. Well sweetheart, I don't think that you need to worry about a call like that anymore. Not because I won't follow through with it, but because there's no one left who would call you. 

We've faded from each other's lives. I look back at the pictures we've taken together and we look older. More mature. Harsher and kinder each in our own ways. You always were the more sensitive one. You haven't even spoken to me since the last time we saw each other. 

The first time you told me you loved me it was over Skype. And at the end of that six-hour call, you told me that you wouldn't say it again unless you were saying it in person. Well, the day that we saw each other came. And something was different. I wasn't all there, I know I wasn't. But I was happy to see you. 

I wish I could love you in the way that you love me. But darling, I just can't. I'm sorry. It isn't just that my heart belongs to another, it's that you and I would never have worked.

I'm crazy. You're mostly sane. But do not, I repeat, *do. Not.* hurt yourself in the way that I do myself. You promised me that no matter what happened to me, no matter what I did, you would keep your heart beating. Tell your own shadows to fuck off, or better yet, send them to me.

Please just talk to me. Just talk to me. Even if it's to tell me to fuck off, that you never want to see me again and you hate me for everything I've done to you. I don't care. But just one more time. I'd like to hear your voice, your laugh. To see those blue eyes that so match my own and at least know you're okay. I just want to know if you're okay. 

We've faded from each other's lives, and I'm sorry that I don't love you the way you love me. I still think of you, though. You cross my mind like a paper fluttering on the wind, like the clouds that roll across the horizon. Your eyes are the color of the sky, sometimes. Blue-grey that is a much warmer color than mine.

You hurt me so badly. You swallowed me whole into your clockwork heart, chewed me up in the mechanics. The cogs tore at my skin, the stale air I breathed in found its way to my heart and made it shrivel with pain. 

But still, I didn't climb out of you; I stayed trapped inside of you every day, taking knocks from your robotic self. Putting up with it and never letting go, determined that underneath all the metal you were a real man.

Still you whirred on with me clinging desperately on; my resolve wavering, my grip loosening, my strength lessening… Until, finally, I let go and you spat me out onto the sidewalk.

An angel flew down and picked up the pieces of me. Gently, he showed me how I could hold on to his wings and he could lift me away from it all. He took me in his arms, he kept me safe. Through the tears of loosing you, he held me close, his wings a buffer against the pain. He wrapped his arms around me as I gazed across the skyline and thought of you. He offered me everything you hadn't. I fell for him, and he caught me.

Your programs forced you back to me and, as my angel held me up, your metal started to melt away as you spoke to me again. But you were still a robot, you weren't an angel. 

As the human inside of you struggled to get free, I told you how I’d fallen for an angel and he had caught me. Your cogs seized and stopped turning; your programs crashed, as you learnt how you had lost me. A fault only the human among the robot could be to blame for.

With one final push, the human inside of you grappled free and finally you stood before me. The man I always knew you were. My angel set me down and I sat next to you, held your hand and listened as – for the first time – you let your guard down. I saw the real you, as you confided in me. 

All that time, I had been holding on to a robot. Suddenly, the robot turned out to have a heart. I know now your heart’s latched itself to me and I realise the responsibility I have.

Although our relationship only lasted eight months, it felt more like eight years. The days I've spent without you, though only about a week, feels like centuries. I thought I could do it without you, but I'm stuck spending my time doing nothing but thinking of you anyway knowing you're not thinking of me for even a second. When I broke it off, I told you I was unhappy, but really I was just making you unhappy and I couldn't take it anymore. I was so cruel to you and it was only after you weren't mine anymore had I realized why. I never told you about the problems I was having with my father.. I just didn't want to bother you... but I ended up taking all the anger I had towards him and directing it towards you. I just couldn't stop myself from being mean, and for that I'm sorry. We separated without closure and still you act like you're completely fine while I'm stuck here living in  the Hell I've made for myself. I have to act like I'm alright in front of you, like the decision I made is still one I hold myself to.

Wow its been a long time since we spoke - Like a really long time, to go from meeting you, to being with you, to living with you, to not being with you, to still have to live with you, to this......

I still sometimes wish and fantasize about how things would have been if you didn't end it, if we were together throughout the second year of university whilst living together, no idea what kind of person I would be now...

But maybe a break from relationships is really what I need, gives me time to get my shit together before I even think about sharing my entire being with someone - I told you after the first 4 months of ""us"" I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you, and thats how I felt for the next 6 months, then you ended it, without reason


You left me madly in love with you and cut off all contact from me for that summer - A close friend died a week later, sure you spoke to me then for a little bit, but you just cut me off 

Maybe I needed cutting off, I was quite clingy by the end of it, only because you'd force me to, just so's I could get a reaction or something out of you

I really didn't see it, and I still can't put those pieces together


after 6 months of us being not ""together"" you started seeing another guy we lived with. that was unfair. I am convinced that I did not deserve that, and that if you'd seen it from my point of view, you'd recognise how depremental to me that that is/was

It got me to move out for the next year though


It got you completely out of my life


I saw you the other week. Actually I've seen you a couple of times in the last 6 months, we've never spoken and its always been amongst a crowd. I fantasize alot about bumping into you and we decide to get a coffee and you apologise, and I saw its alright now, I'm on to bigger things, and I wish you well - but thats never going to happen


The choices you've made forced our lives to be parallel from here on 

And so I will never get to tell you about myself

About how I cook almost all my meals, about how I spent a while living with my sensai studying guitar in his house, about living in portugal with my brother for a month, about how I value logic over emotion, about my plans to stay on to do a masters, about earning my fathers respect


I am over you, but that doesn't mean I'm ready for any kind of relationship - You did hurt me badly, but its lead me down a path of self discovery and self improvement - I would like one day to tell you, and we can be friends, and maybe things will be ""ok"".... but I know logically speaking that that won't happen.

You literally kept me like a pet until you found a new one. You left me for him in the worst way. You lied to me for months, you spent christmas with him in Colorado instead of with me and my family. We lived together. We loved each other. I had to find out from the people you told me I couldn't trust. Now I see that you didn't want me talking to them so that they couldn't tell me the truth. You manipulated almost every aspect of my life. You turned me against friends, your family, and my family. You ruined my sister's wedding, called her best friend a whore, and stormed out to cause a scene. You blew through $28,000 in less than a year. One of our biggest fights was because you didn't think I knew what Quentin Tarantino looked like, in a film I've seen before. You put me in therapy. I lost 15 pounds from depression after you left. I wanted to die.

But I didn't

I found God, truly, for the first time. I found who my friends were. I found inner strength. I found how much better I am without you weighing me down. I found that I can look better. I found that I can feel better. I found that I can live without cigarettes. Without marijuana. Without cocaine. Without LSD. Without ecstasy. Without getting drunk every night. I found that I can play music better than before. I found that I don't have to be stupid. I found that I can stand up for myself. 

I found that I can be someone else. Someone so much better.

And then I met her. She's not like you. She's better than you. You may think she isn't as pretty, or dresses as nice. But you know what? She's nicer, smarter, cooler. She has a job. She doesn't sleep in until 7pm. She's funnier than you. Hell, she's funnier than me. All my friends like her way more than you, and they make it a point to tell me. So does my family. So does your family. And she doesn't sleep with my friends. She doesn't let me walk home alone so she can stay and party, promising me she'll be home later, so I can wake up to an empty bed. She doesn't make me feel scared to ask her for a favor. She doesn't yell at me. She talks with me, not at me. She cooks better than you, too. She goes to church with me. She's proud of me. She listens to my music, and loves hearing me talk about drums. She doesn't think my tapping is annoying... ok, she does, but she tells me instead of letting it fester until it blows up in a huge fight that has us screaming on the street in front of our building at 3 AM. She goes down on me (a lot). She loves it when I go down on her. She doesn't make me awful for talking about other girls. She lets me have friends that are girls. You tried to make me break up with friends, just because they were girls. You made me have to hide my friendships like they were something bad. She hangs out with my friends and doesn't talk shit on them. She's not insecure like you. She's not a coward like you. She doesn't sneak behind my back. She's brave. She's what I deserve. She's more than I deserve. 

Can't you tell? Just from how much more I can write about how she's better than you? I know you will leave him for someone else. Like you left me for him. Like you left the guy before me for me.  

I thought you were really pretty, and I still do, but your looks will fade. They already have started. I've seen how your skin is disgusting underneath the powder and creams. The drugs you take are eating you from within. I bet thats why you went to makeup school. So you can hide that.  

If there is one thing I could say to you though, just one, I'd say this: You fucked up, and now that I know what love *really* is, I can honestly say I never loved you.

I'm done. Either get help or get out. It kills me to say this, because I love you more than anything. I just want you to get better. I just want to get better.

You had an acerbic and caustic wit, and people admired your haughty sarcasm and your judgment of what was good and bad, right down to emulating your tastes in other art.

The work you yourself produced was admired by both the other old hands and the new blood, and although you stopped producing much of it in the last few years, your name was still a legend and you stuck around while your contemporaries had moved on, giving us insight into how things had worked back in the days of the old masters.

When I came to know you, myself with a passion for your brand of art, I got a taste of how unpleasant a person you were early on, but I still admired the way everyone respected you. I admired the way you developed characters, setting, the way you depicted things; I felt in you I knew a kindred spirit who understood the joy of building in your head a whole world, and showing people a view into a small part of it, to glimpse briefly the majesty of this universe concocted, all in your own head.

I'm not going to pretend I didn't do and say some very stupid things (though they were never to make fun of and belittle people, as you did in perpetuity), I'm sure it was obvious I wanted you to be my mentor. I admired you as an older and accomplished man and I wanted to emulate you, to develop to a point where I felt I had your skills, to command the same reverence you did and to make beautiful things just as you did.

I overlooked the fact that you were a failure in pretty much every other aspect of your life, particularly as a student, and that your relationships failed too, and that you were completely incompetent with women -- well, actually, more accurately that you were a *complete fucking loser* with women. I didn't care about any of that; I still wanted to be like you. I wanted the back catalogue of work that was far and away the best of anything our colleagues had produced. I wanted the respect that came with that.

More than anything, I wanted to be your protégé, and to earn your respect. I wanted you to say just one nice thing about me or about my work without qualifying it with some snide remark. And I worked so hard, and you never did.

And I don't know why I fucking cared, because as a person there is nothing about you that's even remotely admirable, and you're so nasty and dismissive that it makes the work you produced that I once admired so ardently become ashen to me. You're coarse, you're mean, you're vulgar, you don't have any compassion, and for some reason it has taken me ten years to realise it.

So, fuck you. *God fucking damn it, fuck you.* I wish I'd never met you. I wish I'd never known you and I wish you every misery, and I hope you feel one day deep within your gut a sudden wrenching despair when you realise people actually used to admire you and you treated them like shit. I hope one day you're miserable, and I hope I get wind of it somehow so I can laugh long and hard at you.

When you die, I want to hear about it, so I can visit your grave and stand over it for a while, just to reassure myself that you're dead and that the world has thereby become a perceptibly better place. I hope, I hope so much I outlive you so that I can have this peace.

No, it wasn't all you. It took some self work and I'm still working on getting better. I still have those day were I wouldn't mind dying in my sleep or getting hit by a car. I still sometimes slice my skin, but I'm working on that.
Things have changed between us. I have changed a lot and you have remained the same. You still avidly drink Mountain Dew. You still smoke too much. You still laugh the loudest. You still post too much on Facebook while watching football. You're still you and I changed. And I think you met me at a difficult time in my life and I am so glad that you held my hand through it. I love you so much. And now we don't talk as much. We exchange smiles and sarcastic comments and sometimes even a hug. And that's okay. Everything is going to be okay.


Love, Anna

As I mention in the beginning of it, I have employed Dr. Brad Blanton's Radical Honesty approach for revealing things to an ex-girlfriend that occurred during our relationship.  Dr. Blanton advocates coming clean with one's partner in great detail, even when it comes to revealing acts of sexual infidelity, despite the painfulness of the process for the speaker and the listener.  I apologize to the readers for being so graphic, but it is how I would actually draft the letter.

Dear Blank,

I am responding to your letter, at your request.  I'm sorry it happens to be two years later, but once I end something, I try not to look back; I feel this is best for everyone involved.  It is now so much later, though, that I can finally reflect much more rationally and maybe help give you some information that will give you closure with respect to the past.  I'll try to respond to your original letter as it was written back then while still filling in the rest of the story.  I apologize if this response is a bit graphic, but I have read and agree with much of Dr. Brad Blanton's philosophy of being ""radically honest;"" the good doctor supports telling the truth in great explicit detail.  I'm sorry if that adds to the hurt (and maybe the grossness for Redditors), but it should also add to the clarity.  You shall learn about not just the end, but the entire path -- anything that was hidden or covert or withheld.  It will likely be painful, but know that it is the truth, and the truth shall set us all free.

You say you don't know how we got to this point?  Well, I guess it is up to me to write the story, for I have most of the info.  It is both of our faults, really.  It is mine in the sense that I am responsible for my own life.  It is mine in the sense also that I am always trying to please people -- never trying to hurt.  I'm not trying to sugarcoat that, for it is a horrible trait that leads to dishonesty and obfuscation at the minimum.  It is yours in ways that are for you to conceive of and think about on your time, though I shall briefly mention some in the course of telling this story to give you perspective on my own thoughts and ideas at the time.  But know that I am not writing here for the sake of blaming you.

I knew very early on in our relationship that things were not meant to go the way they were going, probably shortly after we moved in together.  Before then, we saw each other a lot and spent a lot of time by ourselves.  After that, we moved in together and you brought your daughter to live with us, and -- despite E. being a great kid -- you knew I never wanted kids -- ever.  I tried to accept the fact that if I had to be with the one I loved, I would have to be a little understanding and make that concession.  However, you just made it a huge hassle rather than easier.  Rather than pay attention to your child and maybe stop getting high for a day, you would just yell and scream at her for, in my opinion, no reason.  I can even remember this happening when I had people over from work; how embarrassing!  In addition, you made no effort to keep a tidy house and you had already gotten fired from your job with no intention of finding a new one.  My fault in all this: (1) I was not forceful enough in spelling out to you what I wanted -- I could have and should have said what that was the first time you did something I didn't like; (2) I did not push you to go to work -- in fact, I probably encouraged you to stay home.  Your going to work a couple of times costed us more money than you earned and made it not even worth it.  I don't know the details of this anymore, and it doesn't really even matter at this point.  

My dad passed away and you went on vacation after the funeral.  I know you already had everything booked and I pushed you to go.  I just felt I had a better grip on things if I had alone time, which was true.  Nevertheless, that should have told me something.  You were supposed to be my partner, so I think that just showed that we didn't belong together.  Furthermore, how could you possibly go?  I put myself in your position, and there is absolutely no way I would go anywhere, no matter what you said or wanted, if that were to have happened to you.  Just something I've thought about post-mortem (NPI).

We then bought that big house; I don't quite know why you allowed me to buy such a thing.  I couldn't afford both houses at the same time, and we could never sell the first one.  At one point, I had to steal just to keep up with the payments -- literally.  I'll never forget that for the rest of my life now.  All the while, I fell behind on my taxes and credit cards.  I did everything to keep the image up that everything was okay, just to keep you happy.  This is my fault; I deeply feel that you would have tried to help me if I communicated the problems I was having, but I just felt like I was supposed to hold it all together somehow, no matter what.  Nevertheless, when I had to cut back on wastes of money like having the house cleaned, you did very little to take up the slack; hell, you couldn't even walk the dog.  The walls were closing in on me from all sides, and I never felt that you did enough.  

Everything just pointed to the fact that from the time we moved there onward was a mistake.  Not long after we lived there, I fucked A. at work.  Something about her always turned me on; I'm really not sure why, because she isn't that good looking nor is she my ""type.""  Though I fantasized about her, I never actually thought this would happen.  We were drinking outside one night after work and then we started making out.  I wouldn't dare get caught by other people at work, so I quickly gave her my keys and told her to wait in the back seat of my car.  By the time I got there, she already had her pants off.  We drove to a nearby spot and I fucked her as hard as I could.  I must have been overcome with drunkenness and lust for fulfilling my fantasy, because I gave it to her raw, no condom.  Her pussy was not that tight, and she really needed to be fucked hard to cum.  This was the first time I gave it to anyone other than you raw, and I was worried for months about having gotten her pregnant.  Anyhow, I had a bit of remorse toward her for having sex while she was drunk (just kind of a thing I have), so I invited her out to a nice dinner the next day.  I took her into the city to a nice place you and I had been once, which was a mistake since she had no class whatsoever; the chef practically had to make her a grilled cheese so she could eat.  We then went to the movies out of boredom where I felt her up a bit and then I dropped her off back at home.  She went back and told everyone at work about our encounter within 3 days, at which point I immediately cut all ties from her.  She actually got fired shortly thereafter, but that was unrelated.

Another girl I started talking to was B.  B. had just started at work and was pretty hot by most guys' standards; I wasn't overwhelmed, but she definitely looked decent.  We seemed to have a lot in common; we were both compulsive organizers and so we joked about this constantly.  I sent her pictures of how my closet was arranged and she sent me pictures of hers; I think I won the contest, personally.  Anyhow, she kept jokingly inviting me over to her apartment in the city to view her closet so she could prove how she had won, and so one night I was free and I actually took a ride over just for laughs.  Things started out innocently enough; she finished getting dressed, while I watched some TV.  We sat on the sofa and had chatted for a bit, and then she showed me her closet.  Somehow, we eventually started making out.  I went down on her and made her erupt; her pussy wasn't the most delicious, but it was cute and she came hard.  She then took my cock out and started blowing me.  She was really good, though I preferred your style personally.  We moved from the couch to her bed and began sixty-nining.  She continued to writhe as she came again and again.  Finally, she informed me that she wouldn't swallow, but that I could cum right on her tits, and so she jerked me off while I was still eating her out and I blasted all over her nice melons.  I toweled off and she showered.  I then went back to work and then home.  We saw each other quite a few times, though I wouldn't go through the act again.  Usually we'd just go to dinner or go to the movies, where occasionally she would jack me off while I fingered her, but that was it.  Eventually we grew apart as I didn't like the whole cheating thing that much and wouldn't fuck her.

I felt guilt for these incidents for a long time, and that is why I turned to the Internet for assistance.  I drafted that post to that forum to see if any guys could give me advice about the situation I was in, because I desperately wanted to fix it all.  Unfortunately, you found a reply that had been e-mailed to me on my PC while I slept.  I denied that I was the original poster, and it took a long time for you to believe me.  This sucks because I could have truly come clean then and there and we could have decided what to do.  I mean, let's face it -- it was time to move on anyway, so might as well go through the pain and do it.  But no, I, the ""nice guy,"" smoothed it over and prolonged our relationship.  By the way, yes I did love you, but at that point, it was certainly not like in the beginning.  Also, you were not my ultimate attraction, and by that point I frequently regretted that I had not found a girl who was more to my taste physically.  I'm sorry; this is a horrible thing to have to confess considering the image I put on to keep you happy and living the dream.  This too is my fault.

The rest, well, I guess we had better get on with it.  When everything happened with your brother, I really felt at my wits end.  I didn't blame you or him (though I probably should have), but I took it as an opportunity to break us up so that I could maybe move on.  This was not fair to you, but you would not relent and allow that which ought to have happened to happen, and I didn't know what else to do in my weakened state.  I think you knew quite well that it was over.  I couldn't pay the bills anymore, and we had big troubles that had mostly come from your direction.  We just didn't belong together anymore.  I'm sorry I led you on when that was just the truth.  You had to have seen it too though, no?

We could have technically gone back to the first house to live, since it still hadn't sold after 2 years, but I wouldn't let that happen.  I thought that if that happened, this charade would go on indefinitely, and so I lied and said we couldn't go due to legal problems I was having.  What a coward I was.  If I truly loved and trusted you, I should have just been honest.  And if I didn't love you, then I really should have been honest.  Either way, there is no excuse for my behavior here, and I'm sorry.  Surprisingly, much of my thoughts on what to do there was based on the advice of others; not that I am not to blame, it is just surprising how many other people must pull the same treacherous shit.

I had been friends with C. for a long time, and she was the only one at the time whom I trusted, and I shared my story with her.  When she asked me if I wanted to come and rent one of her rooms, I accepted.  I could have gone to the other house or somewhere else, but let's face it -- knowing my track record from all the above --, somewhere deep inside me, I think I wanted to fuck her too.  I figured if I was around her long enough, something would eventually have happened.  What was my attraction to her?  I don't really know; she is not really my type of girl *at all*.  I guess it just goes back a lot of years; lots of sexual frustration and tension gets built at our work I guess and these things just happen, especially between two people who become close.  My guess is that she too felt this same way about me, but my rational side just wouldn't give it up to her because I felt that work life would really be compromised.  Thank god for *some* rationality from me at least.

While I lived there, I know you had a hard time while staying with your crazy relatives, and I'm sorry for that.  It was time for you to learn to be independent, but that didn't really seem to happen.  It was nice going to see you those couple of times while we were apart in the hotel.  You showed up looking great.  Off came your dress and those plump drooping nipples of yours filled my mouth.  Your pussy was fresh and smooth for me, and I french kissed her for hours as she quivered while mashed against my face.  You were on top and blew me and, as I was ready to blow my load, gripped me hard by the base of my cock and drained me right into your throat.  Your pussy then expoded into my mouth with my nose in your ass.  I flipped over, and you jerked me until I got hard again and then rode me while your pendulous tits slapped together in rhythm till I came a second time and filled you up.  We went to sleep, and in the morning you would be gone to work before I even was awake.  Things seemed like old times almost.  You convinced me that we needed to get somewhere to stay fast, and so I found us a nice apartment in the area.  As the day neared for me to move in, though, I really started feeling nervous.  Meanwhile, A. stopped into work one evening just to hang out and asked to talk to me in the office.  We had a couple of drinks and before I knew it, she had my cock out and she was on top of me cramming it in her box.  She had put on some weight, which I really felt when I grabbed her ass.  I almost came right then and there.  I quickly remembered the regret I had had from last time, and so I told her to stop for fear we'd get caught.  Earlier that very same day, a girl from work who had been bothering me for years to bang her had invited me to her apartment.  I went there just for the heck of it.  She blew me with a condom on and then I fucked her.  It really was nothing great, and I was kind of sorry I did it -- but she was hot at least, for whatever that's worth.  Weird how those two things happened in one day.  Sorry, not trying to make this harder for you, but I just want it all to come out so that there are no more secrets or lies.

As I unpacked my belongings in the new apartment, I just couldn't help but feel that things just weren't right.  I was right back in the old trap I had wanted to escape for years -- and voluntarily!

As we got settled there, I began spending my days with my friend D.  Many times, on my way to work, I would drive up to her apartment, and pick her up, and we would spend the afternoon together.  We were truly just friends.  We had gone to yoga together and a few other things and just had great intelligent conversations.  I even told you about her, because I felt there was really no harm in the friendship.  She always pushed me to better my life, and I her.  She always asked when we would go on a trip somewhere to hike or do something worthwhile, fun, and enriching.  Well, as you well know, my uncle passed away and I had to go to Z., 1200 miles away, so I asked D. if she wanted to come down after the funeral and services finished to stay for a few days, since we probably wouldn't get another chance to go away.  I packed my car and took off driving.  I do wish you and I had hit it one last time, because I do miss you and your beautiful body (evidenced from two paragraphs above), and I can't begin to imagine how you miss me.  I met up with D. before leaving as she had asked me to carry a few of her bags.  We went and had a quick meal, and I set on my way.  After she flew down, we shared a hotel room, but had no interaction.  By the third night, however, she was really horny and asked me if I minded if she masturbated.  I never care about that sort of thing, but something came over me while she was doing it, and I began ""helping"" her.  Before I knew it, I was inside of her and we fucked and got each other off until dawn. For whatever reason, we instantly felt a bond of love for one another.

At that point, I knew I had crossed the Rubicon and that there was no way I could go back to you.  It really didn't have anything to do with you, but it definitely affected you.  You know how bad I am with the phone to begin with, so as you started to give me a hard time while I was away, I was less and less interested in talking to you and eventually just avoided your calls.  I'm sorry about that; that is some stupid defense mechanism I have, and I kept you in the dark needlessly.

Once I came back from Z., I stayed at D.'s place for a couple of nights.  Then, I had decided that I had to let you know somehow that it was over.  To avoid the pain as best as I could, I went and took all of my belongings while you were out and texted you later about it.  This is probably my lowest moment, because after all the time we had together, I ought to have been able to face you.  I don't know what exactly my problem was, but I kept hiding more and more within myself.

I never had been like that before, as you well know, so it is a sad commentary on myself and our relationship that I began to act in this way.  The rest is just details that you pretty much already know.  I know I didn't make it easy for you, so the parts that were not easy for me as a result are understandable to me.  My childish way of dealing with all of this must have been so painful for you when it could have been so much easier.  For this, I am truly sorry; you know me, so you can understand the pain that follows me as a result of these actions.  I know E. was especially hurt, and I wish I could go back in time and handle it properly if for no one else's sake than hers.

All those great times you mention, I miss them too.  Holing up in the bedroom and making you cum for hours, blasting it on your pancakes, blasting it on your face, swallowing your essence while you swallow mine -- that stuff was great.  I can't believe that after all these years, I only have two pictures of you naked, because I wish I had ten thousand just for the occasional *urge*.  All that said, the past is the past, and we do not belong together or thinking about one another.  I really wish you well.  I hope you can find the kind of guy I pretended to be, someone who will really cherish you for who you are, who will be loyal, who will be *honest*, who will be kind to E., and who will help you to be the best person you can be.  As I complete this, I have felt every good and bad emotion for you -- hell, I even craved your body while writing it as you can see --, but I now am letting go of whatever I have held.  Yes we had great times, yes we loved each other, and yes it is long since over -- never to go back.  In the coming weeks and months as you digest this (or don't since you won't receive it), I encourage you to also think about every last feeling you've had as I have done.  Analyze what you did wrong, what you did right, what you could have done better; this is the only way we can use this whole experience as a positive so that we can grow.  One you are done with that analysis, I invite you to release this as as I have -- all of the pain, anger, guilt, remorse, longing, whatever it is that you hold regarding our relationship -- just let it dissipate.  Blank, I bear you no ill will and wish the best upon you, but we shan't cross paths again.

When we were together, we were fools. It's funny, I think, that we're always the most logical ones—the two highly rational ones of our close-knit group of friends. And yet when we were together, we let our emotions run us, let them take over our logical sides. So very uncharacteristic for the both of us. It was a bad idea, and we knew it. And we accepted that.

Being with you was like being in a fairytale I knew was a lie. I knew it wasn't the real world, and that I'd have to return to reality eventually. So I savored every moment in that fantasy with you. 

It's not like we pretended we were different people, and it's not that we were lying to each other. It's just that we created our own reality. “If things were different,” you'd said, and then we'd gone and pretended that they were, we'd carried on like we were in this new reality where your relationship with her had never existed. Our emotions were the same, the words we said were real, we just pretended the past was a different thing. 

But when we'd left fantasy land for the night, and I'd returned to my place and you to yours, she usually greeted me with a grin and a hug, and I remembered how real life worked, and that she had been your girlfriend and was still my best friend. I remembered how much she had loved you, still loved you. You broke up with her a while before we got together, but she still had feelings for you. If she would have found out, she would've hated you, never trusted me again, and neither of us were willing to risk that.

She never did find out, because we ended it before we would've had to tell her or anyone. I guess we both just knew that we couldn't keep hanging onto the illusion and expecting it to turn into reality. I think that in the end, our logical sides won out, wore down our capricious emotions and finally regained control. 

I remember that night, when you told me you were having second thoughts. I think I laughed for relief. Not because I didn't want to be with you, but because I knew we were both ready to return to reality. I was worried one of us was going to hold on longer than the other to our fantasy world, and that entailed pain, and I didn't want either of us to have to go though that. So I was so relieved because the next day, we were still good friends but no longer lovers, and it felt happy but it also felt real. That night, I laughed again with relief, and then I cried because we were quitting that sweet, pretty, comforting fairy tale. 

I'm still astounded no one figured us out, but I guess we were good at what we did. Even now, when we're around them, we act like nothing ever happened. For them, and most importantly for her, nothing ever did. For me, though, it's such a different story--it happened, and I don't want to ever forget that, because you gave me so much. 

Thank you for caring so much about me. Thank you, because when you said “I wish you could see how amazing you are,” I believe you meant it. I believe you still mean it. I don't know if you know how much I needed that. I'm still self-conscious and stupidly shy and I still don't like myself as much as I know I should. But you pulled me so many steps toward loving myself, and I couldn't have done it alone, and I don't think I've thanked you for that. So thank you. You're making me believe in my own value.

1355899682.0,11,self.UnsentLetters,153izn,To the love of my life...,throw_away_5678,14,3,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/153izn/to_the_love_of_my_life/,"I want to start by saying that is likely that you won't stay the love of my life. I'm young and there's the chance that I will meet someone that can take the place you hold right now. I am aware of that, and honestly, it saddens me a little. I am capable of reason and that's why I know that you can one day become this silly memory in my head; someone that will prompt me to laugh at myself and my romantic tendencies.

I am self-aware enough to understand that I could be clouded by a feeling that I love and hate. I've always been a masochist, and right now, I want to do away with logic. After all, you and I, we are both living, breathing beings living in this world. You're not a figment of my imagination or my fantasy for my future. You are someone that I've grown to love. You are real and so am I.

I love you... But I am 99% sure you will never know I love you. I won't dare tell you. It's too messy and I need you in my life. I leave a 1% chance of doing it because I feel that if we could meet the conditions for me to tell you, I would. Some say that relationships need timing and chemistry. We have the chemistry down, but I've never been good with timing and every circumstance that could improve our timing is working against us.

I don't need to tell you about our history. You were there for it. But you don't know the backstory, my thoughts or how I got to this place, and I want you to see it through my eyes. I want you to understand why and how I got here.

I met you almost three years ago, or so I say. When I sat down to think about it, we met before that, but I paid no heed. I let myself think right now, at this moment, if maybe if I had paid attention our story would be different. But timing... You left soon after that and didn't show up until the moment that I met you.

Whatever brought me to talk to you is not very relevant, although I would argue that if I had been less naive I wouldn't be where I am. You were with someone else and it was evident, but after some time, I didn't want to see it. Between noticing and not noticing, I became interested. 

I wasn't always interested in you, it wasn't love at fisrt sight and I didn't think much of our flirtation. I did the same with everyone else and no one really got through to me like you would. You were funny and fresh and I felt cared for. I saw someone that noticed when I was around and when I wasn't –most people don't do that with me– and I don't know what it was, but I was hooked. I never had what I had with you with anyone else. No one ever made me feel like I was so amazing just by talking to them. 

I was happy talking to you, getting to know you, joking with you and, without warning, falling in love with you. I thought that everything you did was special, and not because I was blind to your faults, although I was, but because we were so alike. We would agree on everything, think the same way. I grew to know myself a little better because of you.

Then we hit our first bump. I know to you we were only friends, and you were doing what you thought was best for you and the relationship you were building. I don't fault you for it, and if I do it would only be for leading me on. But I agreed to the circumstances that were presented before me. It is as much my fault as it would be yours. I put myself in a bad position and I cornered you. I know you don't regret it, but in all honesty, sometimes I do.

When your significant other asked you to stop talking to me, to cut me off, you were upset. I know I was partly at fault for you not working out. I wish I hadn't had that effect because I want, above all, for you to be happy. But you were outraged and I know that took a toll. Even if he apologized and the waters calmed down, I know it must not have been the same. 

I am sorry for being an obstacle. Maybe looking back on it I should have walked away but I couldn't; I couldn't because you saw me as your friend but I see you as something else, and like I said before, I want you in my life. 

You and I seem to be the a case of not getting what one wants, but what one needs. I always needed a friend like you, and I got it. I am thankful for you because, even though I am in love with you, I love you and care about you. Sometimes I feel you're like a sister to me; the sister I always wanted but never got. I've learned so much from you and you've made me a better person in a lot of ways, and I've only come to know this through being without you, but I'll get to that shortly.

After our impasse, our relationship really grew. I learned so much about you and at the same time so little. We laughed, we joked, we exchanged views and had fun in our little ways. I think I know you but then I think I don't, so a lot of times I just think I have a crush on you, but then I see myself thinking of you and how I could fit you in my life, and I know it's something else. I don't pull these efforts for anyone else. we really became friends then. Before that we were just two people who flirted with each other and had similar ideas, but afterwards we were connected.

Sometimes I wonder if you are just clever enough to keep me at arms length. I do think you have your suspicions about me and my feelings, but you are not devoid of interest towards me, so you probably want me around but in your terms. Or maybe I slowly stopped having this infatuation with you.

At some point we started to drift, not because we stopped caring, but because I wasn't so high on you that I was able to pull away little by little, to the point I didn't notice when I stopped being so into you. We grew busy and what used to be a frequent interaction started to dwindle. I let myself step aside and I started to participate in new things, and these things would slowly pull me away from you because of time. 

I have to confess that I thought you didn't care for me too much. I used to think you noticed me when I was around but not when I wasn't. I know I entertain you and that with me around you would not ignore me. I wouldn't think too much about this, not because it hurt to think about it but because I truly think you're a kind-hearted person.

And with that, little by little, I wasn't there anymore. So I decided I would cut you out of my life. Given our circumstances, I never thought my being gone would matter to you. You would just see me as somebody that you used to know, even though we never met in person. Even though you knew me in ways most people don't. We were close but not so close that I would be hurting you by leaving. 

At first I was a little sad that you would not be a part of my life, but I took it as something positive for my life. I needed to give myself the chance to meet new people and see new perspectives. I would sometimes think of whether you thought of me or not, but I never dwelled on it. You became a reference to me; someone I would remember under certain circumstances. Someone would speak of abortion or animal rights and I would immediately jump back to when we discussed it. The best analogy I can think of about how my mind worked around you at that time is this: you were like an odd link I once clicked on during some random google search. It wouldn't show up all the time, only when the link fit the search, but it was in my browser history. You probably didn't get that, because you are not tech-y, but I like to think you get the gist.

In time, I stopped thinking of you. I still knew that somewhere in the world there was a girl that has your name, lives in your city, studies in your college and your degree, but I didn't need to dwell on the idea of you, as opposed to when we first met. At that time, I would imagine myself explaining the nuances of my life to you, as if I carried you around in my shoulder. How being two minutes late to the bus stop meant I would have to ride to school without sitting down. Other times I would relive our conversations or imagine how you would comment before a particular circumstance, I would carry you with me everywhere, but like I said, in time I forgot.

I've never told you this, but I write songs. I've written songs since my parents got divorced, over 10 years ago –It was my release and it pulled me through my adolescence– and one day, not sure when exactly but I am sure it was before meeting you, I met a girl. She was a season fling. I was on vacation and she was a good diversion to my obsessive mind, so I developed a crush. When I returned home, I wrote this:

*I know it will be hard for me*
*And it will take a while*
*But someday you'll be a memory*
*And won't hurt me anymore*

Dramatic overtones aside, I always knew in the back of my head that I would forget her. And just like you, I would imagine doing things with her and having her around, but I was sure I would grow inert to the memory of her, so I was sure that someday you'd be a memory that wouldn't hurt me anymore –and yes, I know it's lame to quote my own song, but I think a lot  in song lyrics.

So when I saw myself slowly forgetting you, I felt myself coming out of the woods. I would be normal again. I wouldn't have this feeling of inadequacy all the time. I didn't find myself needing to pick up my guitar and committing to paper what I wouldn't be able to tell you. I wasn't writing songs about how much I missed you or how I would do better once I got over you, because that was happening and I was coming out on the other side. I could relax and stop measuring my words so that I wouldn't give away my secret, because there was no secret anymore.

I didn't allow myself to indulge in finding out how you were doing. I was sticking to the plan of forgetting you and it was working. I was moving on. But six or seven months passed, I'm not sure how long, and I started getting flashbacks of our friends. My time in Canada made me think of all our jokes and out time together. I always tied you to the kind of life I was living while in Canada, and seeing myself in that circumstance made me reminisce. Maybe somewhere in my mind I thought that if I could achieve that life someday, we would have more in common; enough to make our 1% grow a bit.

Then I returned home and I forsaked those thoughts. I was focused on my duties again and I didn't have time to spend on the random thoughts that kept coming up. 

But then one night, I don't know why, I found myself at our hangout. I didn't feel a conscious need to be there, but I was there, and I saw you. It didn't take long for me to say hi. After all, I had no feelings for you anymore, other than the kind of love old friends have for each other. It was nice to say hi and I don't regret it. Not one hour had passed and we were back where we were, like we never missed a day. 

And here I am, seven months more or less after that night, and it feels like it's been so little time but so much has happened. Needless to say, I didn't stay out of love with you for long. Everything that was there clicked together and before I knew it, I was carrying you in my pocket again.

The truth is that you give me a sense of happiness that I just don't get anywhere else. It doesn't make me whole, because I still miss you. We have a ton of distance between us and that doesn't help me dissipate my doubts about you and me. Somedays I think we would work well together, and I can take you down and you can bring me up. Other days I think that if anything happened, either our friendship would find itself destroyed or we could finally have the most honest relationship ever and we would be happy having each other in our lives but without turning any unnecessary stones.

Having said that, the only conclusions I can reach in regards to you and me are that I live in a limbo, where I can't reach one conclusion to what the you and me that is an us will ultimately be, and that you make my life better. Better is not easy or simple, but I already know what it is to live in a world with you in it but without you around me. 

I don't want to believe you don't know who I am, but somedays it's the easiest way to cope. I tell myself you're busy so I don't have to ask myself hard questions, like whether or not you figured me out and you're just giving us a conclusion by stepping aside. I don't like asking myself if you miss me, because I fear the answer will be no. 

It's possible I am fooling myself, and you are not indeed the love of my life. I could very well be exaggerating my feelings for effect. What effect, I am not sure, and maybe I don't love you all that I say I do, but I know I miss you. 

I am getting the sense that we are reaching a conclusion and I won't like it, but I can't make you responsible for my feelings. I can't burden you with the guilt of knowing that I feel the way I feel. It doesn't feel fair to me that you blame yourself for my feelings. They are mine to deal with. 

You've always been the brave one and you are moving us forward, I just fear finding out that our roads will eventually separate. While I know that nothing lasts forever, I don't want to let you go, and I want you to never let me go. But maybe that is what we need.

You will probably never read this –and the fact I posted on a throwaway account makes that even harder– and that is ok. But if I could tell you one thing, and one thing only, and if I ever get to tell you this in person I'll consider myself lucky, it would be this:

You have been loved. You may have noticed or not, but I love you. At some point in your life, you made someone else very happy, even though you never planned or asked for it. When you feel down, and you think that you and your life is worth little, when you think you're too flawed to be loved or whenever you feel alone and misunderstood, I want you to **know** that just the fact that you exist makes my world better, and that makes you exceptional. I don't know if there will be someone that will love you more than I do but, if it's for your benefit, I hope you find him or her. 

You are amazing and full of good traits, and I will always *always* love you. I pray to god that you are happy and, if he has some blessings to spare, blesses me with you.",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_153izn,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/153izn/to_the_love_of_my_life/,

I have seen beautiful stars, such nice scenery on a lot of planets, but nothing compares to your beauty, in my eyes, you are the perfect girl.

Sorry, I'm getting sentimental, I was just thinking how life will be sunny with you. And how finally I will return to the place I belong, to home, with you!. Such happiness cannot bring other thing than tears to my eyes.

I will not make this any longer, because, maybe, you know that my love cannot be measure with words. So, until I find you, [I'll never smile again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UefWW9f1xQQ) .

I just want you here with me. I want to be in your arms. I want to hear from you. It's been a week, why haven't you said anything?

I know it's what you're like; I know you've probably forgotten me, some other girl's caught your eye, perhaps... I know I probably pushed you away because I've been so unstable recently.

But I really like you. You're so gorgeous, that cheeky smile of yours, the way you never seem to be serious, your voice - it makes me melt, so I could be putty in your hands. The words you say to me make me feel like a million dollars, and like I'm a mile high in the sky. Your patience with me makes me feel like I actually matter to someone. Your attraction to me - you deluded, blind-man - makes me feel like the sexiest woman alive.

I don't know what it is you see in me, I know I've been nothing but trouble recently and I'm so sorry to have dragged you through all of that. I'm getting help now.

I knew from the minute I saw you that you would grow to be irrevocably important to me.  I walked through those shitty steel doors, and as soon as I saw your face, it was almost if I could feel my life start to crumble away, years ahead of me.  

Your smile, the way you held yourself, and your glowing innocence melted into my pores and I knew I could never forget you.  I had to have you.  And somehow, deep down in my soulless frame, I knew I would.

I don't remember if it was in wiping your tears, hearing your laugh, or that haunting smile that truly captured me...maybe it was all of them.  But in those moments, I became uncontrollably magnetized.  It was intoxicating.  

When you finally had enough of the lies, the deceit, and the heartbreak, I was there for you still.  You were broken.  Your innocence stolen, from you.  The innocence I wanted so very badly to protect.  But I couldn't do it.  I was only a little too late.  But I would give anything to turn back the clock and be there before him.  I wouldn't - couldn't, have hurt you like he did.  

The best I could do now, was to put you back together again.  Piece by piece.  And I think I did.

I shared with you my life, and my love after that.  I've never felt such bliss, and maybe never will again.  Your kisses were like morphine, your touch an indelible high.  When we finally made love for the first time, I swear I could feel my very self slip away in your euphoria.   

Even in our less than perfect moments, there was beauty to be found.  We hurt each other countless times, and in countless ways, only to come back to one another, longing for reconciliation and acceptance once more.

But this time simply cannot be.

The first time I saw you, I knew you would matter.  I knew eventually we would be together.  And I knew we would love each other, and we most certainly did.  But like all good things must, it came to an end.  An ending that was chosen by you, and not by us.  

Somehow, somewhere, on our long road to perfection, you compromised the dream.  You shared your love with another, leaving me trapped in your vice.  Trapped with nothing but fading memories, and a shattered heart.  Trapped alone in my head, with no one to rescue me.  No one to put me back together, as I'd done selflessly and lovingly for you.  No one to fix me, and restore what little humanity I have left.  

So here I sit, in the present but stuck in the past.  Wondering how it went wrong, and why.  Writing the most painful feelings I've ever had, and still have, hoping that somehow, someday, you'll find them.  And maybe then, you'll feel like I feel.  

But somehow, deep down in my soulless frame, I know you won't.  Your love has left me forever, and found solace in another.  And now, I am truly shattered.

I sometimes wonder if you remember it all the way I do. If you remember how you bullied me relentlessly all through elementary school. How you stomped on my feet and crushed my hands and pulled my hair. How you always lied to the teachers and claimed I was the one who'd done those things to you, so then it was just our words against each other and you were never punished. How you smirked and laughed at the sight of my blotchy, tear-stained face - you loved so much to upset me, and I was an easy target. You gossiped about me behind my back and mocked me to my face. You were an expert manipulator. In front of my parents or my brother, you'd act totally sweet so that, for the longest time, no one would believe me when I told them how cruel you really were. That was probably the worst hurt you did me - making me feel so alone and abandoned. Remember 6th grade, when you pushed me too far and I finally snapped, screaming ""I hate you! I hate you!"" in front of everyone, students, teachers? I hope you felt at least a little shame, but I honestly doubt it.
I don't know why you hated me so much but maybe it was because I had things you didn't have - a happy family, a way with words. I understand that I was a little strange, especially early on - odd habits, a little lost in my own head - but I think it says something about you that you were so threatened by my strangeness that you just had to make an issue of it. Deep down you probably hated yourself, maybe even more than I came to hate you.
I hope you're a better person now than you were then. Some might call it unfair to judge a person on their behavior under the age of 12, but the emotions are still raw for me, and when I see you around town I just refuse to acknowledge you. You once had so much power over me, but now you have none. There's a part of me that still feels so much rage towards you, a vindictive side that fantasizes about shaming you publicly or seeing you miserable and defeated. But ultimately I owe it to myself to move on. You brought so much pain and anger into my life, and I think the only way I can win this fight you started so long ago is by forgiving you. I forgive you for hurting me, even though you've never apologized. It's been more than ten years. You were just a kid, even though you seemed like some kind of all-powerful witch at the time. You were scared; you were selfish; you wanted to feel in control. I forgive you; or I am trying to forgive you. I am far stronger and far freer than I was, and you have no more ways to hurt me. I know that I deserve respect, and I hope you've learned the meaning of the word by now.

You seriously bring this petty shit onto facebook where other people can see it?  Can you not treat our mutual friends like normal without acting like a high schooler over the shit?

I'm not your friend anymore.  None of this shit is important.  I don't care about seeing your name in places.  It doesn't take me back and make me feel nostalgic, it makes me feel absolutely nothing.  You're a stranger now.  You're not important--you're someone I'll never speak to again.

So what is the problem here?  Apparently our mutual friends feel the need to fill me in on what it is you think of me and honestly if you don't care, start fucking acting like it.  I'm tired of having to walk on eggshells around certain people and minimize contact with them so that you don't ignore them.  You can have your goddamn friends if the fact that they talk to me bothers you so much.  You're lucky they aren't pissed at the way you're acting too, or else you'd be alone.

But that's what you want, isn't it?  You want to be alone.  You want to be alone and miserable so that some stranger (a ""cute, nerdy"" stranger with facial hair if past occurrences serve me well) will come along and be alone and miserable right next to you.  Am I right yet?

I don't hold anything that happened between us against you.  Mostly because nothing happened.  You literally went from being my friend to being a stranger in a matter of days because you were afraid of history repeating itself.  You were afraid of being abandoned, so you abandoned me first.  Great move.  I wouldn't have done that to you, and I think you really just wanted an out.

I have hated the guy for a couple of years now. I can't stand him at all, and you've known that. I have told you over and over again I never wanted you to marry him, that I almost didn't go to your wedding because of him, and you agreed with me, after he kicked you out for the last time.

Just two days ago you and I were talking with my roommates about how you were going to do everything you could to gain the upper hand in the divorce and how much you disliked him right now. Two days ago you were laughing about how much of an ass he was.

Okay, so I get that you're worried for him. He doesn't deserve anything bad to happen to him, according to you. He is still your husband. It pisses me off, and in my opinion, crosses a line when that worrying you do goes beyond yourself and you expect others to care too. No. 

My answer is no. I will not pray for him, I will not worry about him, and I will not talk to you about how scared you are. I do not like him, I do not care what happens to him, to be frank. You're a good person, and I love you. However, I don't love him. Please, don't expect me to care because you do. It doesn't work that way.

I've seen doctors, psychologists, been admitted to hospital. No one I've seen in these past few months understands the love I had for you. I went through SO much with you, and you still treated me so badly...
They ask 'but if he did this to you, and this to you, why did you stay with him? Why didn't you just leave?'

Because I loved you, and despite everything, I would come to see you, get you things, constantly trying to prove myself to you........ stupidly trying to make you LOVE me when you told me you hated me, that I was worthless, that I was a slut and a whore and an idiot.
Even thinking about that logic is messed up :(

Life without you has been the hardest few months of my life. I've gone through a rollercoaster of emotions I didn't even know was possible.
I've screwed up my studies... again and now I don't know what I'm going to do.

People assume I hate you. I don't hate you at all. I was terrified of you, so terrified of what you could do... but to be completely honest, ...

...all I wanted, and this is the complete truth. All I wanted was for you to be happy. To be better. I felt that if I was in your life, you wouldn't be happy since you always told me how angry I made you.

I felt like I had to sacrifice it for the both of us to be able to lead happier lives..

I wanted you to go and talk to someone. To work out your problems. To find you exactly why you react the way you do...


I heard you were sick and it killed me to not be able to be there for you. I'm so glad you finally got it checked out (i told you) and that you are okay, and safe.

I feel that what's happened has in a weird way been necessary. It's made me realise a whole lot of things, and I hope it's made you take a big step back and look at things too. I hope for the better...


It kills me, but this is how it has to be, at least for a while longer...

I think we both needed this distance for some time. It would have given us a greater appreciation of one another, might have lessened the severity of a few fights we had over the past two months.

I really miss you, right now. I miss you, and our city. I can't stop thinking about it, can't stop dreaming about it. It's not a 'grass is greener' outlook, as I know I had the chance to come see you. I was just an asshole and threw it away, because I'm still confused. I hate when people can't figure out what they want, it's one of my biggest pet peeves. It's awfully hypocritical of me, and I truly hate myself for it. Perhaps, in time, I'll learn to be less critical of myself and my flaws/faults.

I feel at a loss now, worried that you're reveling in the fact that we can't be in contact with one another for some time, patting yourself on the back for finally realizing you're better off without me. 

Anything I try to get away from or move on from never truly allows me to be free of its grasp, and you are no exception. Each channel I turn to, each book I read, almost every web page I stumble upon.. There is a reminder of you, the city we spent so many hours in together, and what we had. Severe weather alarms have been blaring all afternoon, pointing to our city and what's taking place. And you couldn't be farther away from it. To you, it may as well not exist right now. You are almost in another world, another time period. There's a good chance you won't even be able to get to a phone to contact me.

You're over 4,000 miles away, and a number of timezones separate us. The jet lag lulled you to sleep hours ago.

I drove by myself for the first time ever, and went to orientation for my community college.

I spent over an hour sitting in a corner by myself, catering to my anxiety and pretending to be tremendously interested in my class schedule.

You were in the first tour group that walked by.

I recognized you, of course. 

We’ve shared meals, and we share a best friend.

But you and I have never had a conversation just to the two of us.

It was always just me fringing on whatever nerdy things you guys were saying around the fries stuffed in your mouths.

But today…today you sat with me. 

You talked with me. You laughed with me.

You helped me figure out where to go, and what to do.

You stood with me in line to get our ID photos taken, going as far as to get the form from the front for me. 

You weren’t afraid to dance slightly to the song on the radio that I was too afraid to even admit I liked.

You let me talk at you about things that had been bugging me, like the turkeys that had been in the road that morning, or the Introduction to Computers class that I have to take, while remaining (seemingly) interested.

You let me show you the textbooks I had gotten from the bookstore that I had previously avoided due to the sheer volume of people flowing in and out of the doors. 

You waited patiently for my conversations with various other friends to me, strangers to you, to be over before you would turn back to me with your eyebrows slightly raised, a new or old topic of discussion ready to be broached. 

I was really dreading this day, but by mid-afternoon, I was dreading it being over. 

We left together, after simply sitting together and talking about Doctor Who, Star Trek and our varying skill levels in math for hours that felt like seconds. Because you're scrawny, I picked you up to prove my earlier point that it automatically ends in a smile, which is what I wanted to give you.

You told me to have fun driving, as you knew I was worried, and I wished you the same, as I’m awkward.

You drove out first, but I ended up pulled up behind you at two separate lights before I had to change lanes and go a different direction.

I’ve never been more simultaneously relieved and saddened at one occurrence. 

I don’t (think I) suddenly have a crush on you just because you saved my day, but I am filled with an intense desire to show my appreciation for what I’m not sure you know you did for me today.

Of course, you won’t read this. You’re probably playing WoW or League of Legends right now, and I really doubt you look at this subreddit.

I just wanted someone to know that my day was made so very much better with the help of one person, one person that I never would have expected to make me smile.

Thank you.

P.S. The combination of your uncontrollable grin, the brightness of your eyes, and the light flush of your cheeks after I set you back on your feet was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen. If I was to fall for you, it would be because of that smile. God, that smile.

I don’t really know where to begin here. I guess I’ll just start with the end. I decided I wanted some distance because I just couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t take how much I cared about you, how everything you did affected me so much. And mostly I couldn’t handle how little I seemed to matter to you. I don’t want to end our friendship. I still can’t imagine my life without you in it in some capacity. I just need to withdraw for a time. Because where we are now, is crippling me.

And please don’t think that this is because you don’t matter to me, or that I don’t appreciate all you’ve done. You do matter to me. I do appreciate all your help.

When we met, I was an empty shell. I was wandering from day to day, not really caring about things or people and just letting time carry me forward. I didn’t wake up looking forward to the day; I didn’t go to sleep satisfied with its conclusion. I just drifted on. And then that dance, I was captivated by you. I was so surprised by you and I felt there was so much waiting to happen. I couldn’t just ignore you like I was everybody else. I didn’t know anything about you, not even your name, but when we would randomly meet in the halls I had to stop and talk to you, even if for a sentence at a time.

The next year, when we really started talking, I couldn’t help but trust you. You seemed so bright and vibrant and I was drawn to you. I couldn’t have fought it if I’d wanted to. But I didn’t want to. I needed someone I could trust, someone who could help me get out of my shell and give me hope. And you did. You gave me hope, Mal, for the first time in a LONG time. You gave me a reason to keep going, a reason to look forward to each new day because you’d be in it. And I fell in love with you.

I didn’t know what to do with that at first. There were some seriously awkward moments when I was terrified that I’d done the wrong thing. I came close to panicking and shutting you out. And in retrospect, I kind of wish I had. You’ve been good for me, Mal, but in light of recent discussions I think maybe I might have been better served without you.

Every new guy you had in your life hurt me. A lot. I was so horribly jealous of them because they’d get to know you in a way I felt I never would. And I felt slighted by that. I felt like I was a much better person than they were and I was much closer to you, and yet you repeatedly chose them instead because “you didn’t want to ruin our friendship.” I laugh, now, since you’re still friends with your exes, and the last exchange we had was you basically telling me to fuck off. But I digress. So for each new boyfriend, after my initial spurt of jealousy for Nathan, I just smiled and buried it. Supported you, encouraged you, tried to spend time with you when I could.

I remember one time, you were over and you looked at me and said “Maybe I should let you pick my boyfriends from now on,” and I was SO hopeful you meant me. But I was scared too. And then on the drive home I tentatively brought it back up, and said I’d thought I could do a decent job in that role. And you looked at me, like I was a cross between a mental patient and an alien, and stammered a little before managing to say you had no idea I thought of you in that way. I probably wasn’t good at communicating that. I wasn’t good at communicating much of anything to you. But I thought you’d have figured this out by now. We were going on two years of friendship and I’d been so close to you for so long. You came to me for advice and comfort and solace and I thought, clearly mistakenly, the fact that I kept providing it showed my interest. So that really crushed my confidence for a while.

The next spring, when I was “with” Nikki, I thought your reaction to that was because underneath it all, you really did care about me and want me to be yours. I thought you got so worried I’d replace you with her because you wanted to matter that much to me. I remember telling Nikki that I thought it was hilarious that you were worried that she’d replace you when you were never more than a friend to me. I was just trying to allay her fears that you’d beckon and I’d leave her in the dust, and yet, if you had beckoned, if you had said you wanted a real relationship between us, I would have left her in a heartbeat. But that window slammed shut the next day. And then reopened the day after that, when I told her to go back to Kyle, which is a decision I will probably regret to my grave. But it was too late. I’d manage to alienate both of you and royally piss him off too. I’m good at that.

And then we started talking about marriage. You have no idea how happy that made me. I didn’t care that you made it a conditional agreement to take effect in six years, I was just so thrilled that you were seriously discussing the possibility of us getting married. It felt like a dream was coming true. I thought that maybe if you could see how wonderful that dream was, how good I thought we could be together, you’d remove the condition. We’d date. Get engaged. Get married. Live a long and happy life together. That wish only got stronger when you kissed me. I was so in love with you, Mal, and I wasn’t really thinking about your position because it looked like you were starting to return the sentiment.

And then suddenly, nothing changed, yet everything was different. And there wasn’t any fixing it. We drifted apart while remaining close. I can’t really explain it, but this summer, after that wonderful night of my return from college, we were never really together. We were alone in the same place. It took me a while to notice, and even longer to admit that I didn’t know why it happened or if I could reverse it, but I got the hint. Especially at your open house. I am still impressed by how you managed to avoid me for ten hours. Even when we did speak, it felt like you were reprimanding me for being isolated and alone when I thought you knew I hated people. The more people around me, the lonelier I got. And you were my only friend there, and try as I might I could never find you. That was basically the end for me. I tried so hard to get us to spend time together after that. I wanted desperately for us to be us again, if we ever were, not you and your project. Nikki and I got in a huge argument because I’d told her how in love with you I was. How completely you dominated my mind. How even though part of me was incredibly frustrated by it, I treasured every minute you deigned to spend with me. I have never felt more like a toy than I did telling her that, and the worst part is I honestly enjoyed that status because at least you played with me. At least I wasn’t lying discarded in the back of the closet. And I think it drove Nikki a little crazy. And we argued about it, and got better, and then a few days later you went through my phone, an action I’m still questioning, and got wildly suspicious and angry about us being friends. I remember telling Nikki only a few days before that no, dear, if Mal were to force me to pick between you and her I’d take you and she kept telling me that I’d cave, that I’d do anything to keep us friends. That was when I snapped. A few days later, when I finally saw you again, I was with Nikki and we hung out for a bit, then I faked a phone call so I could take her and leave. I figured it was pretty clear that I wasn’t terribly important to you. In someone’s words, “[I] give in to [you]. [I’m] a fucking puppy, a toy. [You] play with [me] when [you’re] bored and use [me] to make [yourself] feel better,” and that seemed pretty obvious. I was just a comfort friend anymore, someone on whom you could rely to make yourself feel a little better and then wander off and ignore and not really pay heed until you needed me again, and like your little bitch I was I’d be there, happy and obliging and thinking maybe this time she’ll see.

Well, I’m not. I’ve got all the girls in the world to ignore me and your doing so isn’t that special, and it is taking a toll on me. So, I’m out. I don’t want us to drift away entirely; I still enjoy being friends with you and I still love you and I’m pretty sure I’ll always be willing to drop everything and come running to your side if you ask, but I can’t let myself do that. I can’t let you just walk all over me without even the decency to take off your heels. Okay, that metaphor sucked. I hope this will wake you up a little. I hope you’ll decide my friendship is important to you and I hope you’ll make the requisite changes in your character for me to come back. I really do. I desperately want to help you and to be your friend and to try and repay you for the life you gave me. But where we are right now? It’s killing me, Mal. It is. I’m throwing away happiness left and right over you. I stunted my relationship with Kat because I felt conflicted about you. I gave Nikki away because of you. I can’t even think about getting to know girls at my college because I still was in love with you. You gave me my life back, Mal, and I don’t think either of us would want me to let it wither because of you.

So I’m writing this to try and communicate, for once in our friendship, how I really feel. I want you to know that I do love you, with all my heart. You’re so incredibly important to me and doing this cuts me to the core. I fight with myself every day over it and it takes all my control and some outside help to keep from running back to you, from flinging myself at your feet and apologizing and swearing never to leave you again. I feel so awful for abandoning you, for leaving when I swore I’d always be in your life. It’s some of the more excruciating pain I’ve ever felt, and you should know that means a lot, but I’m doing it because I believe I need to. Because I believe that maybe this course will help you, maybe help us, and because a tiny sliver of hope says it will help me. And for once in my life, I think I should be selfish. I’ve given you so much, and so far it’s been wasted effort. I can’t keep pouring my life into you in hopes that eventually we’ll bloom. I need to live for myself, or at least for someone who will return the favor. I need to stop defining my life based on your opinion of me. You gave me life and hope and other people, Mali, and its time I actually used them rather than clinging to your leg. You’ve been saying this for a while now, but I think I’m only now really hearing.

I love you Mali. I do. I’m scared of standing up on my own. Of venturing into the unknown without your hand to hold. And I will always, ALWAYS, be your friend when you need me. But I hope you understand when I say, at least for now, goodbye.

Honestly, years of being the world's greatest dad, years of being my hero, years of happiness, all thrown down the drain. Sure, when I was five I thought everything was fine. I knew you and mom weren't together anymore, and while I didn't understand why, I was just happy I still got to see both of you. Things weren't perfect, but in my eyes, we were still a family. 

And then you met her.

I thought Cary was a nice enough woman. She treated my brother and me fine (at first) and didn't try too hard to be a mother figure to us. When you got married, I thought, great, you could have a chance to have a wife again. I was so excited and genuinely happy for you. Most eight year olds would be bitter and resent their parent marrying someone else, but I was just so damn happy that I got to wear a pretty dress to the wedding. I could tell you were happy too, and that was all that mattered.

When Adam came along, I loved him. I loved Don too, of course, but he'd already been my brother for seven years and Adam was just a precious baby. At the same time, I saw things were changing. You stopped taking me during the week. I was confused, but mom said that it was only temporary, I forgot about it. You had your thing to do and it wouldn't be so bad to wait a while for things to go back to normal. Well, they didn't.

Then Eva was born and you started taking me only once a month. The reason you gave me? Because you didn't want her to take away your kids like mom took us away from you. This reason is horse shit. My mom always took us to your house and made sure to paint you in a good light. She supported us seeing you, more than you did. Cary may not have liked us around, but you are our father just as much as you are Adam and Eva's. What made them so much more important to you than us? But I held my tongue. I was already seeing you so little as it was, I didn't want to lessen that time. But I should have said something. If I did, maybe things would have been different.

Fast forward a few years, you actually turned us away at Christmas. Who the FUCK does that to their children? On mother fucking CHRISTMAS!

I wish I could talk to you about all this, but you always freak out and tell me I'm being stupid. That hurts more than you probably realize.

I just can't keep asking you to spend time with me when it's so painfully obviously that you'd rather not. You go to sleep half an hour before I wake up in the mornings. You wake up and head to Reddit. I am not about to let myself feel jealous of a damn website. No. I don't have the best self-esteem, but it's higher than that. From now until the semester starts, I'll keep myself busy. I can't sit here and watch for signs that you're bored with Reddit so I can catch you and ask you to spend time with me before you grab the television remote.

First off, I love you. With all my heart and soul.

I have been alone my whole life, I have never had a girlfriend or female relationships in general. Never could I connect romantically with any women, even though I have tried more than anything.

Then one day, you came into my life. The most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I didn’t trust you, how could I. I have only ever been messed around by women with head games and false promises. How could i suddenly trust the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. We were forced into a situation where we had to see each other every day. Time passed, eventually I saw you for who you were, trying to make life easier and better for everyone around you. I started to trust you, you started to trust me. Our messages became more and more personal. We connected on a level I didn't know existed. I found myself again the fool, head over heels for someone who couldn’t be with me due to circumstances. Going out of my way for someone I thought I knew at the time was only using me. Then it happened. You sent me the one message I have never received from any woman, you told me how hard things are because you are in love with me. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever received from the most beautiful person I have ever met, inside and outside. Because of your beauty, men were falling over you like flakes in a snow globe. But you never connected with anyone in the message world or in the real world like you connected with me in front of everyone. It was perfect. I was for the first time in all my years alive, happy. I never felt true love and happiness up until that point.

Everything in the world was amazing and new again. When I was reluctant to tell you these things for fear of making your life harder due to your circumstances. You would then tell me exactly what i was thinking and wanted to tell you. We were two perfect lego blocks that fit. I did start to struggle, the times you were gone started to weigh heavy on my heart. I missed you more than anything, you would then later reach me and tell me how you missed me. This would give me enough fuel to push through the dark days until you came back to me.

Years passed, then on that one day when you had to have ""the talk"" with me. You explained to me how hard it is for you in your circumstances to have me in your life. I felt horrible that I was the cause of pain for the one person in life I never want to cause a frown or harm in any form or way. It hurt, I was upset but wanted to hear what you had to say. You continued with tears in your eyes of how much you love me and because of that, have to let me go because it was causing you too much trouble and hardships. I knew if I truly loved you, I had to cut you off. The hardest thing I have ever done. It became too hard to bear on a daily basis. The pain inside is ripping me apart. I have not cried since decade ago when I lost a much loved family member. For the first time in a long while I cried myself to sleep that night. Since then I have lost count the amount of times I cried from that point. The most perfect thing in my life, I had to throw away. I still cannot deal with it and try to avoid the subject in my head.

Some time passed, the pain got so bad I started to do anything I could to kill it. All advice pointed to keep myself busy, hobbies, exorcize and friends. Nothing worked, even though I put a smile on my face and pretend I enjoy it, I don't. I feel torn up inside and can only think of you every second of every minute of every hour of every day. And that is killing me. I started smoking pot to see if I could find revelation in an alter state of consciousness, it helped at the start. But that did not last and I then later am more depressed when high, thinking only of you. I started to drink, then that became more and more. It only made things more horrible to bear when I was drunk, I would struggle to hide the fact that the only thing in life I would feel at that point is that I Miss You.

Life is still going on, I fight the demon everyday which the depression of not being with you. Before you, I was not happy but also I was not sad. I didn’t feel anything and could go on without caring thinking women must have something against me personally as everyone else never struggled to find someone like I do. And those who did, did not end up with a 100% failure like I did. Now you are gone and all I have left is an empty void. You seem to also not have the constant smile on you that you had when we openly loved each other. I have to see you and sit next to you everyday and can’t speak to you. Main reason is because I cannot bring myself to cause you pain, because I love you. If in order to help you means I must live in hell for the rest of my life, then I will accept it, because I would do anything for you. Even though I feel deep down that all I want is to have you back in my life. We don’t have to be married, couple or relationship. Just having you there would mean everything to me.

Since you are gone, the whole world has lost its color. The only time I see something that is not in a shade of grey is when I catch a glimpse of you. The color would then stab my heart as a reminder I am to leave you be. Good bye my love, my friend, my everything.

Maggie,

I just miss you being into me. We used to sneak off and make out and things just because we both wanted to. *You used to be into me.* That thought won’t leave my head. You *used* to be into me. What happened?

I also think about why I’m so into you. I mean, you’ve really mistreated me a lot, and you don’t really seem to care. That’s a shitty combination. There are so many times when I’ve just said “Fuck you; I’m done.” in my head, become angry at you, and then inevitably thought of your face and felt all the anger melt away against my will. In the years that we dated, you claimed all of my heart and then, in a long and painful fashion, squeezed it to a shrivelled pulp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Nothing Better - The Postal Service*

Remember that time I cried during this song when you picked me up from the train station? You cared about me then. That was recent. You hugged me really meaningfully. Thanks for that. Despite the tone of this letter, I think you're a good person.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


*Simeone’s Dilema - WHY?*

I’m treading on thin ice with this song too. Bad idea, I know.

I took for granted how amazing the feeling of being loved is. We used to spend so much time together. I loved every last moment of it. Even when we fought... my god, I was just so happy to be with you. You wanted to be with me, too. You laughed at me. You reached for my hand. You played with my hair. You know, that’s why our time together sucks now. You don’t enjoy being around me, then I recognize that, and we both have an awful time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The first part of Friday night was so shitty. I’ve never felt worse. It all started with the fact that I wasn’t invited to the party. I don’t really care about that, but you said “It’s an alcohol party. You wouldn’t even have a good time.” Meanwhile, I’m just upset that you don’t want me there. Before, you would have wanted me to go with you.

Then I went home and cried and wrote you a note. Not because of the whole party thing. Just because I was feeling particularly bad. And I just wanted you to read that fucking note. Then you called me, and you weren’t willing to help me. You didn’t feel sympathetic for me, even though you caused this fucking mess. Helping me was a bother for you, and you were angry at me. For what? Ruining your plans? There I was, on my bedroom floor, hiding from my parents, sobbing. And you were worried about your plans. You felt nothing. How did I become so insignificant to you so quickly?

*Talking Shit About a Pretty Sunset - Modest Mouse*

You somehow thought that I made you come over. How could you draw that conclusion from a conversation that ended with me saying “Don't come over if you don’t want to talk to me.” Also, how could I make you do anything? That doesn’t make very much sense.

Anyway, you got here, and you witnessed me absolutely lose it. You watched me cry, exclaim all my feelings for you, apologize, and *finally*, **finally** tell you that I think you really fucked up. But somehow, you were mad at me. At least at first. But then, I think something clicked. You seemed to feel guilty. Maybe you weren’t, but I hope you were. You should feel guilty, anyway. Not for leaving me, but for not being up-front with me. That’s the one thing I deserved, and I didn’t get it.

After that, we lied in the grass together under the stars. Why did we do that? After deciding not to speak to one another until I got back from school, we lied in the grass under the stars and talked for a very long time. Just like when we were together. It felt just like it did when we were together. We used to do that all the time. All of these things you said and that I gathered--that you were over me, that you didn’t enjoy time with me--dissipated for a moment. Did you feel nothing for me that night? Nothing at all? If you truly have no feelings for me and if you truly think we’re incompatible, explain that situation that you instigated. (And while you’re at it, explain all the times we hooked up after I went to school.)

And you wonder why I can’t get over you. It’s because of shit like that, Maggie. You say you’re not into me, and you usually act like it. But sometimes our time together is lovely and beautiful. It’s those lovely and beautiful moments that make giving up thoroughly impossible for me. Do they mean nothing to you? If they do mean nothing to you, stop putting me in those situations, because they mean a lot to me.

And now you don't give me a second glance. Neither does any girl after she finds out my problem. 


If there's anything you taught me, it's that my disney ideals should be tossed out the window because women are cold creatures. I don't know what men like in a women, I can only go on my experiences and my friends, and we all have similar thoughts. But your kind isn't doing me a favor through my dark times. My depression is spiraling out of control, and it would be bad enough if the severe anxiety wasn't adding fuel to it. But now, I can't even go to many places to unwind, or drink my troubles away. Being in the darkest time of a person's life with no emotional support is something I wish not even my worse enemy goes through. The trouble is, I wanted ""love"" since I was in the fucking FIRST GRADE. It's pathetic. I don't know why I'm like this, but I am. If I surpass this, I can surpass anything. But I don't think I will.

I was a brat, I hated everyone, and I was going no where fast. You changed that, love. Something in you changed me. When I first saw your post, I knew there was something different about you. I messaged you and we started talking. I couldn't believe someone like you was interested in a fuck-up like me. I thought I was left for dead and had nothing to live for. Then we Skyped for the first time and I realized that this was *real*. You made me giggle like no one else had before. I got butterflies from thinking about you again. You gave me something to believe in. A date everyday. You were my ""something to believe in"". I got attached too quickly, though. You told me not to but I did. I wanted to. You were perfection in my eyes. There was literally nothing I could do to stop it. You made my heart swell to an Ungodly size anytime someone asked about you. Babe, I know I've told you this before but I can't ever seem to get the words out right. Now, I think I've got them figured out. Sometimes I forget I'm in a relationship with you; you've become more than that -- my best friend. On the flipside, though, you make me cry. More than I'd like to admit. You don't seem to realize that I am probably one of the most sensitive people you will ever meet. Sometimes I just want to cut myself off from you and see how you react. Sometimes, just sometimes, I wish I could know how I make you feel. But I'm staying and I'm keeping you. As long as you'll still want me. *I love you. Don't forget that.*  ",,False,,t5_2seir,False,,,True,t3_solr4,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/solr4/im_keeping_you/,
