So, here we are... 3k users and I said we'd start the contest around that number of subbed bugs. Crazy thing is I have no idea when it will end. It will end, that's for sure... however I don't want to rush the creative process in the least. **The designs submitted may be used to mint our very own round eventually, that is the goal.** I will mail one .999 1 ozt [""blank""](http://i.imgur.com/ljLRSXD.jpg) to each of the winners (or to one person if they win both sides). These were obtained from the Mulligan Mint by /u/GrymmWRX for the purpose of this contest. I'm sure they are out there somewhere from some mint or workers, but I had never even heard of or seen a blank planchet of .999 Ag before I received these. How cool of a prize is that? He donated them out of his pocket and I can't thank him enough. Anyway, I can promise that this will be reposted at least a couple of times throughout the process and 1 weeks notice will be given before the end of the contest. We can put a message on the top of the sub that everyone will see when it loads. So, now for the details we have thus far. (Things may be added or changed, nothing is set in stone other than the prizes, one for each side of the round).

----

Please do not incorporate Snoo (the reddit alien) or ""reddit"" in the design. Apparently they want a large chunk of the gross sales if we do that. Not feasible with a silver round.

Please make sure the designs are saved in the file format .ai from Adobe Illustrator. If they are saved with the pdf compatibility option, we should be able to click on them and view with any pdf viewer.

Multiple submissions from the same users are allowed and encouraged. However, I can say that I would prefer to split the prizes so two people each win one round AND keep in mind just because you have more submissions, it does not increase your chances of winning. The main factor will be for a design that is most excellent and professional.

Upvotes will make a difference, but the final decision is up to the mods and then myself if needed.

Keep in mind that you are giving up any and all rights to your design by submitting it. This means that should yours be chosen, your only payment for use of your art will be the prize you win from this contest and the ability to be able to say that your design was stamped on rounds for distribution. By entering the contest you are giving us permission to use your design in the process of creating silver rounds.

More rules may be added and/or existing ones may be changed. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask away. Myself and any of the other mods can answer questions you may have regarding the contest. **WE DO NOT KNOW YET WHEN ROUNDS WILL BE MADE!** Trust me, as soon as we know details, you guys will know details. I have zero ability to keep a secret typically so yea... you'll know when the time has come.  :)

Good luck to everyone and get creative. The only thing that you can't change is the shape. It has to be a circle. Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2t1b5,False,,,True,t3_1d1qnu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1d1qnu/contest_design_an_rsilverbug_round_win_something/,moderator

[This prize](http://imgur.com/a/uHu8C) was donated generously by /u/GeilKrampus and he and his friend /u/rhalliwell will judge the contest. If they are in a stalemate, /u/nugget9k will be the deciding factor. Please thank him for the idea and prize, I'm just posting and running it for him pretty much.

This is not for ""dirtiest"" or most ""beat up"" round. We are talking about the design being ugly.

This contest will run for a week. So if you feel the need to shop for an ugly round to win, go for it. You have until next Thursday night to post an image following the rules.

You must take a photo of the round with your reddit username and date showing in the photo.

You must have an account at least 90 days old.

Now, the really cool part of this is... anyone in any country is welcome to enter. If the winning person is in the US, I will ship the Freedom Girl to them at no cost. Also, as long as he doesn't have an issue with it, if you win and don't want a Freedom Girl for whatever reason, I'll attempt to come up with a prize from my stash you like and just keep this round myself. If you are in a foreign country and want the Freedom Girl, I will check on shipping costs and if they are more than US shipping, you can pay the difference for the prize.

We have been to several funeral homes and websites that cater to these needs, and the prices were exorbitant. 

Many places had prefabbed silver or gold tubes, but they were unbelievably tiny and cost around $1k for like 5 grams of metal.

I spoke to a funeral home about a custom project, and I would provide the metals. For a 5 ounce project, they wanted over $2k for one (I needed two) - no discount for two. And they would only cast in .925

Then I met pheenix - I know many of you would call me crazy, but I trusted him and sent the metals. I researched his online rep, and it was very solid.

I sent him metals to make 2 bear claws which were my son's favorite animal. He had two favorites - T-rex and bears - one living and one extinct. He made the claws and sealed my son's ashes at the top with .999 copper slug that I sent him. He also cast in .999

He treated my son's ashes with the greatest respect. He made a dream possible for two parents that really couldn't afford the asking price from funeral homes. 

He was so professional and respectful. My son died a year ago - just a small child. He created two pieces that are of relic quality. He did it for such a reasonable price that I am giving him a gem uncirc ase and generic round for a sterling bug just to send money his way. I am also going to send him a crazy gift package in the near future. 

He was so kind, so respectful, that I have made it a personal goal to see his business succeed. Good people like this deserve to have a thriving business. He epitomizes what I wish everyone was like. Him and I are opposites in general beliefs, but he still remained professional and you would've never known we even chatted about that stuff.

In the near future, I am going to contract him to cast a couple things and pay him a true artisan's price. 

Here is a photo of the completed project -

I worked at Lehman Brothers for many years and was convinced that paper was the way to go.  Then I was laid off, Lehman went under shortly thereafter even though my contacts inside the company said everything was going to be ok.  Everything I worked for was just gone.  Lehman paid company matching and bonuses in company stock and  I was a firm believer in the Employee Stock Purchase (ESP is appropriate because you would have to be a psychic to figure out what upper management was really up to) and invested heavily.  Yup.  I was a sheep.

I learned the hard way about diversification and worked hard to rebuild my investments from their shattered remains. I listened to advisors that didn't have anything to gain or lose from my investments doing well or poorly.  

One (very old) advisor in particular looked at my asset mix last year and commented I didn't have any PM holdings.  I went and out and SLV and GLD.  

At our next meeting, he laughed and said I was doing it wrong and pulled out a tube of gold eagles.  I think gold was ~1600 at that time.  I couldn't comprehend that this little tube was worth $32K+.  He pulled an eagle out and let me hold it, feel its weight, then put the printout of my GLD purchase in my other hand.    He then took the eagle and put a $20 bill in my hand.  There I am, holding a $20 bill in one hand and a paper share of GLD in my other,  both feeling empty and weightless compared to the eagle.  I immediately understood and was hooked at that point.  He made sure I understood that paper, fiat and physical each have their strengths and weaknesses, how to put each one to work for me, never get them confused and above all have fun.  He pulled out a silver eagle and handed it to me and said this should get me going.  He died before our next meeting.

Many of you know, but I get daily PMs from those who don't (I don't failt anyone for this)

I'm stressed as all hell at work as I have to lead a team to scour through 11,000+ phone records and uncover  nearly 33,000 pieces of information about them all.  Basically a months worth of work with a 2 week deadline and half the requiredanning.

School isn't so bad. I'm slowly but surely working in a 12 page paper in the manhattan project. With kids at home, this is a challenge at best.

Next Thursday, a doctor will make a 2 inch incision in my foot, sever a tendon, and remove a nerve. If I don't have this done, my military career is basically over due to the physical fitness standards (I can't run). I've got 12 years in and can't afford to throw that away. Recovery is expected to take a few months.

In order to focus on the above items, plus domestic responsibilities of a married man with 2 kids, I am taking a break from casting until further notice with 1 undisclosed exception. I don't expect this break, or going dark as one redditor put it to last past the first week of July. I currently have 2 projects on hold that involve approx 2 troy pounds of .999 silver in total.

Once I resume casting and complete those projects, I will make a sort of ""I'm casting again"" post. Until then, I will be happy to discuss prices, weight of my castings and basic information. If you would like to acquire one of my castings, I'm afraid that you must wait until everything prior to this sentence has transpired.

I will keep a link to this thread handy, and not to be a doucher as my brother in law says, I will kindly refer any requests to place an order to this thread.

I thank everyone for their support and for taking this hobby to the verge of an actual business. 

For those who choose to down vote this thread or not find anything I've said in this thread acceptable... That is your right, I respect that.

Buckle your seatbelts because things are about to change.

My first job as new moderator will be (after cleaning out the spam filters)... electing another moderator.  I know that we are all getting tired of election polls, but I do feel that using votes from past elections would not be fair.  In past elections the people who nominated themselves got downvoted, and some very qualified bugs were not nominated at all.  

I am going to come up with a fair way of of conducting a election for the second moderator.  It is likely going to be a poll post, where I have a comment with each candidates name and only upvotes count.  I already have a list of people that I am including, but If you want to make sure you are on it please PM me.  I want moderators who are on Silverbugs morning, day, and night so we can quickly resolve filtered posts.

After elections are over, Me and VP we will look at picking some additional moderators and will likely not be poll.  I want Silverbugs leadership to be a team effort and not a dictatorship, as I think this would benefit the community the most.  One vision I have is that instead of general moderators we may have specific roles.

One direction I would like to take is a greater focus on contests and events.  This is exciting and something for us all to look forward to.  We will need lots of help here with organizing and fundraising, so please be patient in the meantime.  It may take some time to get set up but I do promise you that this will happen.

Please message me if you have any needs, concerns or ideas.

Much more to follow. ",,False,self,t5_2t1b5,False,,,True,t3_17kpd5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/17kpd5/moderator_nugget_reporting_for_duty/,moderator

1366498247.0,43,self.Silverbugs,1crng2,Worst I've ever been treated at a LCS.,tonguejack-a-shitbox,50,7,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1crng2/worst_ive_ever_been_treated_at_a_lcs/,"So I have been trying to forget this but I just have to vent to someone. At the recommendation of a fellow bug on here I stopped into a LCS in Memphis TN Friday while I was there for work. I do want to say I do not blame the fellow bug for what happened what-so-ever!! To get to the point I decided to stop in and see what deals he may have and get to know another shop owner. I frequently travel and deal with business owners on a daily basis. One of the things I do to break up the day is look for local ""treasure shops"" as I call them. So anyway, I go into the store and look around for a minute until the guy working the counter (assumed owner the way he talked) greeted me and asked if he could help. I told him I had heard about him through an acquaintance and was wondering if he had any silver rounds or bars for purchase. He looked at me like I was nuts. I can't remember exactly what he said because I was just blown away but I can remember specific phrases. He told me I ""needed to use some judgement"", that no one has any of that right now and if they did they aren't selling it. ""You need to learn when to buy silver"" HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT!! He told me that I need to learn to watch prices and come in when they are higher and more silver is available. No exaggeration here! He asked ""would you sell your silver right now? well neither will I"" He then told me he actually had plenty but he wasn't selling any. I am missing out plenty here, he was legitimately lecturing me on buying silver but he was telling me to buy at higher prices. I was speechless, I just told him my guy back home had put silver aside for when I got there, I guess it's the first thing I thought of that wasn't about how much of an asshat he was being. I know it doesn't matter much but helps for context, I was a Drill Sergeant in the army at one point. I don't do well when someone speaks down to me, it doesn't fit my personality. Anyway the kicker to the whole thing is I have this coworker that isn't into silver much and he was riding along with me. He was there for the whole thing, completely looked like a jackass in front of him thanks to asshat LCS owner. Of course, I heard about it the entire ride back home. I actually got a text earlier today that just said ""you need to use some judgement lol"". It is funny when looking at it from his side but it still pisses me off. Oh well, I am in Memphis monthly so his loss in the long run. Picked up 12 ounces at my guys place and a 1/4 gold eagle while I was at it.

I already sold the one I had on hand to another person so I told him no and that I could get some for him at the LCS.  His response was something along the lines of ""Yes that's great.  Grab me as many as you can""  Went to the LCS and they had several at a decent price so I got 5 of them (first mistake).  I tell him that I picked up the coins and get no response from him for a couple days.  Send him a more assertive email and he is like ""oh yea ive been busy.""  And says to me ""I think I'm only going to take 3"" (then why did you tell me to pick up as many as I could???)  Wait another day for a response and he tries to lowball me by asking for a lesser amount than the original agreed upon amount.  I meet him halfway and give him my address.  Another day passes (we are at about a week now) with no response and I ask him what's going on.  He says ""oh I live in Canada... I can't ship there""  I try to reason with him but responses are at minimum 2 days wait. He now refuses to complete the trade and I am stuck with the coins I got for him.  The saying really does ring true here,  ""no good deed goes unpunished.""  Well, I learned my lesson there... don't buy coins for someone to trade unless you have a good trading relationship with them currently.

**tl:dr**  dont buy coins for other people on reddit in hopes of trading with them.

EDIT:  I went to bed right after I posted this.  Thanks for the support.  Since people are offering to buy them, I have 3 1983, and 2 1982.

We all enjoy seeing pics posted of silver, obviously. So here we go. 

Stage a picture of your stack in a way a pirate would stash it, most likely in a chest (anything is acceptable though, be creative).

Include your reddit username, /r/Silverbugs  and the current date written on a piece of paper in the picture.

Host the picture on imgur.com and post the link in this thread.

Only users that are at least somewhat active on reddit are eligible. Meaning you should have posts somewhere on this massive site (and not just the freebie subs looking for stuff). I just want people that contribute to this awesome community to be the ones that win prizes. This is an insanely huge site, there has to be a sub you will be comfortable to post in. Do it.

I will take upvotes and comments into consideration, but the final say will be mine. Downvotes don't matter to me.

I will pick a winner this Sunday morning when I wake up. That should give everyone plenty of time to think and set up some awesome pics to submit.

Oh yea, the winner gets [this.](http://i.imgur.com/kfSwREq.jpg?1)

So, here we are... 3k users and I said we'd start the contest around that number of subbed bugs. Crazy thing is I have no idea when it will end. It will end, that's for sure... however I don't want to rush the creative process in the least. **The designs submitted may be used to mint our very own round eventually, that is the goal.** I will mail one .999 1 ozt [""blank""](http://i.imgur.com/ljLRSXD.jpg) to each of the winners (or to one person if they win both sides). These were obtained from the Mulligan Mint by /u/GrymmWRX for the purpose of this contest. I'm sure they are out there somewhere from some mint or workers, but I had never even heard of or seen a blank planchet of .999 Ag before I received these. How cool of a prize is that? He donated them out of his pocket and I can't thank him enough. Anyway, I can promise that this will be reposted at least a couple of times throughout the process and 1 weeks notice will be given before the end of the contest. We can put a message on the top of the sub that everyone will see when it loads. So, now for the details we have thus far. (Things may be added or changed, nothing is set in stone other than the prizes, one for each side of the round).

----

Please do not incorporate Snoo (the reddit alien) or ""reddit"" in the design. I have a few emails out asking permission and I'm still awaiting a reply. I don't want to use it and then have a problem down the road for the makers should be go that route.

Please make sure the designs are saved in the file format .ai from Adobe Illustrator. If they are saved with the pdf compatibility option, we should be able to click on them and view with any pdf viewer. (We may be able to work with other formats, so if you have an idea in mind just enter.)

Multiple submissions from the same users are allowed and encouraged. However, I can say that I would prefer to split the prizes so two people each win one round AND keep in mind just because you have more submissions, it does not increase your chances of winning. The main factor will be for a design that is most excellent and professional.

Upvotes will make a difference, but the final decision is up to the mods and then myself if needed.

Keep in mind that you are giving up any and all rights to your design by submitting it. This means that should yours be chosen, your only payment for use of your art will be the prize you win from this contest and the ability to be able to say that your design was stamped on rounds for distribution. By entering the contest you are giving us permission to use your design in the process of creating silver rounds.

More rules may be added and/or existing ones may be changed. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask away. Myself and any of the other mods can answer questions you may have regarding the contest. **WE DO NOT KNOW YET WHEN, OR EVEN IF ROUNDS WILL BE MADE!** Trust me, as soon as we know details, you guys will know details. I have zero ability to keep a secret typically so yea... you'll know when the time has come.  :)

Good luck to everyone and get creative. The only thing that you can't change is the shape. It has to be a circle. Thanks!

Reminder from /u/chuckscoin ~&gt; It's obvious, but please don't forget to include ""1 Troy Ounce .999 Silver"" -- Not in that format exactly, and not that exact wording, but you must specify weight, and include .999 somewhere, or else many LCS won't accept them when you decide to turn them in.

My boss explained to a guy on the phone while in Tim Hortons that he bought some silver coins he's looking to resell. So the guy asks him a few questions and he's responding. This is how the conversation goes: (keep in mind they're on the phone)
Friend: ""What's the difference between bullion and scrap silver?""
Boss: ""One is pure and the other is 90%. So the pure is going to cost more than the other.""
Friend: ""Okay, I'll buy 10 oz, in coins.""
Boss: ""10ozs? Cool. It'll be $250, you cool with that?""
Friend: ""Yeah, I'll meet you later at your store around...5:30?""
Boss: ""I'll tell my guy to set it all aside in case I don't make it.""
My boss stands up and goes to leave and the lady a booth overs tells him ""Sir, I don't care what you do, but don't make drug deals in a public place please."" Confused my boss asks what she was talking about and she starts getting loud ""All your talk about ounces and meeting someone at your store and it costing $250! I SHOULD CALL THE POLICE!""

Neither of us knows anything about coins, but from what I've read online, their value depends greatly on their quality, year, mint?? etc... I'm beyond overwhelmed as my husband and I are about to purchase a house, and this would really help with a down payment. My sister and I agreed to split everything right down the middle, after we sell it.

My greatest hesitation is that we're going to get completely screwed. We obviously don't know what we're looking for, or even where to begin. Is it worth my time to go through every coin to look for something rare? There's thousands, at least. 

We're starting with a bag of dimes, and separating the Roosevelts, Barber dimes, and Mercury dimes. It seems like we have about the same amount of Roosevelts and Mercury dimes, and only a handful of barbers. Should we also be searching and dividing by years? It seems impossible as there are just so many. Should we just take them in and sell all of them at once?

1366428588.0,34,self.Silverbugs,1cpzif,Understanding a few little fundamentals in the silver market,argoff,37,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1cpzif/understanding_a_few_little_fundamentals_in_the/,"You may have all heard this before, but I saw some posts that indicated that some people haven't, so I thought I would post this.

Supply:

On the supply side of the silver market, it is important to understand that most silver production in the world does not come from silver mines, but comes about as a byproduct of copper mining.     As in, the price of silver could go up drastically, and many miners would still have no incentive to ramp up production.   Also, even if they did, bringing silver production online takes a few years and tens of millions of dollars, if not billions.   So the supply side of silver is very tight, and will remain that way unless something drastic happens.  (ps this is also probably why jp morgan, the largest silver short, decided to get into the copper futures market recently)  

Demand:

On the demand side, most silver is used in trace amounts.   It is used to do things like plate connectors, or in things like enhancing a reflective coating of a glass surface.   As in, the price of silver could increase dramatically, and people will still not cut back usage of it in industry because that cost is a very tiny amount of their overall cost structure.  

Monetary side:

On the monetary side, this side is the most interesting.   In a normal market when prices go up, usage declines, but in the silver market, the more prices go up, the more it looks like an attractive store of value in relation to gold.   So prices going up in silver will actually cause the supply and demand problems of silver to get worse.  Especially since the gold market is far larger than the silver market.

The big banks:

This is why the big banks must keep the price of silver contained at all costs.  The moment silver starts to look like an attractive alternative to the much larger gold market, it will literally have a nuclear explosion in price that won't go away for a long time.

How do the banks keep the price of silver down:

Simple, they promise to sell it.   Like if I go into a neighborhood, and buy a house for 500K and then put an add in the paper promising to sell it for 200K.   The predictable result is that all the sale prices of other homes in the neighborhood will go down as well.   The banks use a much more sophisticated way of doing this using naked shorts, but the effect is still the same.

So why would the banking system want to invest in a way that loses money on silver:

They may lose billions dollars on silver, but gain hundreds and billions of dollars taking money from the federal reserve loaned to them at say 1%, and putting them into US treasuries that pay maybe 2%.   Games like this are only possible while they can continue to force people into the dollar market.   Once people stop trusting the dollar, then the federal reserve will actually have to start restricting the supply of printed up money to contain the panic, and those 1% loans will be gone.

So why does the government let them do this manipulation:

Because as the 1% loans go, the 2% treasuries will go too.  The government will actually have to pay real interest on the money they borrow, and people will start to see their government programs for the wealth sucking shams that they are.  It will cause  a political backlash that can and will make the austerity backlash look like a ice cream party.

So what is going to happen in the silver market:

The government will probably continue to sanction price manipulation, and the banks will probably continue to play their games, and try to keep people away from the silver market, either by shorting, or by forcing money into alternatives that make other investments look more attractive for awhile.   They will keep doing this until something ""breaks"" in a big way, when that happens it should not be surprising to see the price of silver go nuclear and possibly blow the gold price out of the water of which gold will also go up quite a bit because they play a lot of similar games in the gold market for the same reasons as well.  They will probably continue to print up money till the US has an argentina like currency crises, which will probably be the trigger event.

So when is this going to happen:

I don't know.  I never thought the housing bubble could go on as long as it did, but it did.  I do know that the US debt to gdp ratio is awful, that the banks would all be dead by now if not for a trillion dollar gov bailout to hold them over till the fed could lower the prime rate to zero and loan them ever more increasing amounts of money at 0% apr.   The numbers make the US look like a classic banana republic ready to have a currency crises.   

PS: also, any economic decline also means less industry and less demand for copper, which means even less silver. 
PSS: I should also mention margin.   A lot of times when silver rises, the banks will make it extremely easy to buy silver futures on credit (margin), and then later yank the rug out and demand repayment causing a panic out of the silver market.  I haven't looked at their cost structure here, but wouldn't be surprised if they make money shorting silver.

So... a few of us here and there have made a flat design out of our stack and some have even made some small teetering actual stacks and posted the pics. This time I want to mix that up a bit and force people to be even more creative.

I want to see a picture of something you BUILD with your stack. Not a flat picture, not just a tower. Think more along the lines of legos. Make some ""thing""... something fucking amazing. The more extravagant and most recognizable ""thing"" will probably win... so think about what you can ""build"" with what you have and give it a whirl.

Make sure the picture has a piece of paper in it that has your reddit username, the date and /r/silverbugs written on it.

Make sure your account is somewhat active on reddit, even if it's just in one or two subs. In other words, I would like to encourage people to not ""just lurk."" Speak up, be social and share your knowledge! I have contests every month or so here, so even if you're a lurker now, start being active and chatting a bit and enter the next one.

The winner will ultimately be decided by me, but I typically will go with the greatest number of upvotes/comments. I may choose one I like personally more than the majority, so I have to include that disclaimer to prevent whining.

Ok, so why in the world would you do this? Well, because I have 5 complete sets of dime cards available and the winner will get 1 complete set ($50 value!). The set includes a Capped Bust, Seated Liberty, Barber, Mercury and a Roosevelt as seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/bJzL4). Only one other Capped Bust dime card like this is out there to my knowledge so these sets are pretty rare to have complete and will be most likely as I don't have a large supply of inexpensive Capped Bust and Seated Liberty dimes nice enough to make them.

The contest will end Sunday evening at 9PM EST. That is when I will announce the winning ""sculpture of silver"" and get the info on where to ship the prize to.

Thanks a bunch everyone for keeping this place fun and informative and keep up the posting of various pictures and articles. This is the best online community I've found to date and I will continue to support it via being a mod and having contests and giveaways.

Keep on stackin'!

PS - After the contest is over, there will be a new permanent trade post made and stickied for everyone to post on and edit over time. These will only be unstickied for contests (so far).

First things first, I want to thank [u/Zuizide](http://www.reddit.com/user/zuizide) for handling this contest and doing an amazing job.  We both have high hopes of accomplishing something really awesome for this community and it's members and it's been a goal for a loooong time.  But I think we should all come together and agree on some things.  We have a lot to figure out.

As you can tell, we're trying to figure this thing out as we go.  I mean, we don't even know if we can use r/Silverbugs in the design at this point! And I completely realize that we are asking a lot for 'any and all rights' to design for the [blanks](http://i.imgur.com/ljLRSXD.jpg) and bragging rights.  But there are important reasons for that.  I will promise you on my reputation here that I am not out to screw anyone.  That is true for all the other moderators as well.  Anything we can do to make this a win-win for as many people as possible is my goal.  As things are now, I am already floored by some of the designs I've seen. But I want to somehow sweeten the pot for the winners.

I do have some ideas.  As nice as the prize is, I'm going to throw in 2 additional blanks to the contest.  These blanks will be 2 that were 100% made in house with material that is .9999 pure silver and [SQUISHED]( http://imgur.com/CdO5HsN) by me personally and were destined to become proof blanks.  I'll post pics once I am holding them.  I don't know how I want to incorporate them into the contest yet, but I think it would be cool for users to collaborate and make a coin together!

I would also like to offer a [tube of 20](http://imgur.com/mpvA5wK) copper blanks for a good copper variation reverse.

But we need ideas!  Like slogans we hold dear, like 'if you don't hold it, you don't own it', or 'in silver we trust'...also the old 'SiLVeR BiTCHeZ!!!

He told me that it is guaranteed to go up double or triple in the next five years and that I'm crazy to want to use a bank. (isnt that too good to be true? If it was so guaranteed why isnt everyone running out and buying it?)

He said that the world economies are crashing and it's a safety blanket that is separate from paper money. I don't know about all that, I know things are bad but is it really *that* bad? all I know is that now we have zero flexibility with our money because it's all in coins. He's even sold some of his stuff to buy even more. 

If we have to buy something there is an extra process of selling coins, but the way he hordes it I doubt he will ever sell them. Can someone here tell me what to tell him to stop putting all his money in silver and gold? Then maybe I can show him this topic. To me it feels he is just throwing his money away, when we were supposed to be saving for a home and retirement.

But a post like this (which I like for the record) gets almost no downvotes and is technically off topic.

Now, I went through all the hoops to make sure that they weren't stolen and that I had my ass covered in case the deal went south. I even made sure the person was aware of their worth too, since I felt bad about pretty much ""stealing"" them from him. 

Now for the unofficial contest part. I'm feeling extra generous right now and I would also like to give back to the community, so whoever can guess the price (CAD) that I paid for each CML (50 total), I will send you 1 2013 CML postage included. There will be prizes as well for Tue runner ups (havnt decided the prize or numbers.

Here's the picture :)

While this one didn't have the most upvotes, it was very basic yet at the same time had great symbolism. The ""smoke stack"", the iceberg coin info in the way of it and the larger ""iceberg"" it's about to hit really did it for me. You thought about it and used your imagination and I really liked that!

I thought about this also for a while and I decided that although these prizes aren't ""great,"" they are something for those that I also enjoyed a lot. Each user below will get a Silver Dimecard from me for their submissions. I can't afford to give everyone one, but I figure a couple more prizes is better than just the one set going to the winner!

So congrats also go to;

/u/musefanpl for [this series!](http://imgur.com/a/vx0KR)

and last but not least...

Would each of you please PM me with a name and address you want your prize sent to and I will get them out the day after I get the information.

Thanks so much to everyone for participating in the contest and please remember... if you have any ideas for future contests and/or are willing to donate to the prize pool via silver, cash, bitcoin, whatever... anything helps and I can get you info to donate. I will hold contests regardless, but with donations I can give away more obviously. Also, if you want you can donate a particular prize AND specify how and what the contest is for that prize or prizes. Your name doesn't have to be put out there if you prefer anonymity, however I am more than willing to give you full credit as well.

Alright guys, if everything works out well, my 13 or so years in the food/bar industry will be coming to an end soon enough.  So I would like to enjoy it while I can!

If you are a Silverbug in or around the DFW area, It would be my pleasure to meet you and serve you a fine meal.  I only work on weekends.  Saturday in time is 3:30pm, Sunday is 5:00 pm.

I work at Pappadeaux in Arlington, Texas...ask to be served by the silver guy, they know who I am!

If you tell me you're a Silverbug, then you get a dime.  I only have 5 up for grabs and hopefully I can put my 2 weeks notice in short order!

The coin symbolically acknowledges the receipt of respect, which is due to the new rank and position. 

I am a part of an Air Force ROTC Detachment.  I see these guys (and gals) transform from timid, brand new college Freshmen, to leaders of tomorrow's Air Force.  I've been doing this for four years and this graduating class was extra special since we've gone through the journey together.  I even promised some of their parents that as long as their child put in the effort, I'd take care of them and see them through the end, and I did...

As a result, a few of them thought I deserved to be their ""First Salute"".  Its a great honor for me, and I know it meant a great deal to both of us. I'm proud of all of them, and just wanted to share this experience with all you Silverbugs!

I used a razor to cut the paper rolls to look inside then used scotch tape to seal it up.  I then used all the rolls to buy gas, food and groceries, or you can just give them back to the banksters in the box they came in.  I think all the half dollars have been picked over due to one coin out of the 2000, and I saw the you tube video about that guy who got $60,000 in silver in 1 year doing the same thing.  

Also interesting was when I paid for gas with the half dollars.  I gave the young clerk 30 Kennedys.  I said they were half dollars and I would like $15 on pump 4.  She counted them all out and said, ""This is $7.50"".  I repeated to her that they were 50 cents each, she tried counting them again but it was obviously tough for her.  I guess people have got so used to swiping cards of digital currency that they have no idea what coins were at one time, no wonder so many people are in debt.  Another clerk at another place asked me ""so these are dollars?"".  And another clerk gave me more change back when I used half dollars as payment.  I corrected the clerks and did not make any extra money from anyone (other than the bank).   I can't believe it is really this bad, we live in interesting times.

As for the one coin I found, I gave it to my nephew and talked with him about the melt value and the dangers of inflation.

We were running a little late but managed to find street parking about a block away with a parking meter. We only had to pay for parking for about an hour, and after 8pm it would be free. The problem was we didn't have enough quarters, we needed one more to guarantee we wouldn't get a parking ticket. So my wife turns to me and asks, ""you don't have any quarters?"" I reply, ""I have a silver quarter."" (I always carry a 1942 Washington quarter in my wallet, since I received it in change a few years ago.) 
""Is it worth more than a parking ticket? or paying at a garage?"" she counters. I had to admit it wasn't and then I found myself feeding it into the meter. I felt a little sick, especially when I heard the telltale silver 'ping' when it dropped.  
But I've decided to look on the bright side, perhaps some other silverbug will find it, maybe it will start a new stack for a young bug out there.  Maybe someone will get it in change like I did, or some lucky coin roll hunter will discover it. I hope so. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest. 
PS rest of the night was fun, no parking ticket, and still cheaper than garage parking.

The idea of exchanging bitcoin for physical assets is an alluring option so I thought I'd make a small order from Coinabul.
So yesterday during the dip (I think we're already dipped below that level as of now...) I made a simple order for 3 American Silver Eagles, and get the invoice.

U.S. Silver Eagle - 1 ounce coin
USSilverCoin1Oz
3
฿0.77
 Subtotal 
฿0.77
 Shipping &amp; Handling 
฿0.12
Grand Total
฿0.89
Grand Total to be Charged 
0.88812880019033 

Ok, so they rounded up, no sweat. Within minutes (time it took for my wallet to catch up the sync) I sent .89 to the provided address. Easy Peasy.

Fast forward to today: I receive a new invoice, saying my order was placed May 15th, as opposed to May 14th as the original invoice states, and now the Grand Total is .93.

I forwarded them the original invoice plus a screen shot of the Bitcoin transaction details to the address they provided and asked them to fix it. And now we wait.

I did read here about problems with Coinabul in the past, but I also saw mixed ideas on whether they were honestly trying to get their stuff together, and 3 Eagles isn't a life changing loss should they fail to deliver.

To be continued.....
8 days later and I have my 3 new ASE's in hand, and they are in great looking shape! Over-all not too bad for a small order... http://imgur.com/Edxaknx

Thought everyone would be pleased to know that I just completed shipping a sale to Humlee. Some of you might remember me trying to sell the silver a while back.

I have to say I'm plenty impressed with the level of trust between members here. Because of Humlee's trust I was able to buy textbooks for my Calculus and Japanese classes, as well as food in the fridge enough to carry me over to next month.

The coins are both the same coins, same denomination, year, grade, and even same respective grading companies.

Someone goes on to notice that the Draped busts are only 5 serial numbers apart and therefore was likely once part of same collection and graded at the same time.  That and the 1783 silver coins were also from the same collection in the same shipwreck.

1374532812.0,23,self.Silverbugs,1iuf50,Attempted scam after silver delivery (sort of),throwawaysilver1,33,10,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1iuf50/attempted_scam_after_silver_delivery_sort_of/,"I recently ordered about 60 pounds of silver bars from a reputable precious metals dealer and had it shipped to my office via UPS. It arrived OK. My secretary signed for it. No problem.

Two days later, the weirdness begins. My secretary told me that a stranger had been leaving messages all morning. Finally he got through and talked to her. According to her, he identified himself as “Dxxxxx Cxxxxx” and told her he is looking for something he ordered online and that got sent to our office by mistake and he is on his way over right now to demand it. He says he knows the weight of the box and he knows who signed for it (he said the first name of my secretary). He asked her if we received any heavy shipments lately. She didn’t answer. He says it might have been silver coins or ammo. This part is fishy because it doesn’t make sense that he didn’t know exactly what it was that he supposedly ordered. He says it’s one of these two things and he can tell by the weight (on the UPS tracking form). He says he is both a coin collector and an ammo collector and he has recently ordered both of these, so it could be either one of these. He tells my secretary that he is on his way right now to our office to get what’s his and he knows for a fact that she signed for it and again states that he knows her name is xxxxx.

I call the police. They are on their way. I meet the man at the door. Tall white guy late 30’s. Has a 5 year old daughter with him. He shows me a piece of paper. It is a printout of a UPS tracking order. It matches exactly the legitimate one that I got from the silver company that I used to track my order previously. He says he is here to “get to the bottom of things”. Said he ordered something online (either silver or ammo) and according to the company that he ordered from, it was sent to my office. I asked him why they would send it to me. He said he is not sure but it says on the tracking slip clear as day that it was sent to us. I asked him if he asked the company that he ordered from why they would send it to me. He said he didn’t know. They don’t answer their phone. They only communicate with him by email. He said that the fact that he had the tracking form was proof that it was his package. I said that anybody could have hacked access to UPS. He said “No. It’s impossible. I should know. I happen to work for UPS. It’s impossible to get someone’s tracking info”. I was about to ask him to prove he worked for UPS. Not sure why I thought to ask that other than to debunk his fake story.

Anyway, now the cops arrive. I tell them the story. They take his ID and check his plates. Both match the name that he gave me. They ask him what he wants. He said he just wants to get information to help him find his missing stuff. The police ask if he had insurance. He said yes. They tell him to file a claim. He leaves the office. After he leaves, the police ask me if I had anything sent to me that I didn’t order. I told them NO, that I had legitimately ordered silver for myself. He lectures me that it’s dangerous and a bad idea to own physical silver and that if I liked silver to just buy some silver certificates. I thank him for the financial advice.

I called the silver dealer to tell them story and they did not know of any such scam. I called UPS. They were very diligent and took all the information and called me back a few hours later to tell me they had no employee with that name and phone #.

I called back the phone # of the suspicious guy, DC and tried to get more info out of him. I basically was trying to find out for my own satisfaction if he was truly a customer looking for his lost package or a scammer. I asked him the name of the website that he ordered his supposed silver from. He said SBBULLION.COM  I couldn’t find any such thing. Every time I asked him a reality check question, such as “Why is it I can’t find such a company on the internet?”, “Why is it that you don’t know exactly the type of silver (or ammo) that you supposedly ordered?”, he just kept deflecting the conversation back to “I have the tracking slip. And I’m just trying to get what’s mine.” Finally he said, now my kid is upset and my wife is upset because my kid is asking if daddy is going to jail. Are you going to keep calling me and bothering me about it? I didn’t do anything wrong. What did I do wrong? I just wanted to get my ammo”. I promised him I wouldn’t call him back without a good reason.

Any thoughts?
– How did he get the tracking info?
– What was he trying to pull? Did he seriously think that my secretary would just hand over the package to him?

EDIT: ImpalaPooge below may have solved the mystery. If so, this is a real victory for me. 1. False Alarm, nobody is stalking me and my silver 2. I'm now smart enough to be on high-alert paranoia mode, as we all should be
You guys are awesome!

EDIT: JUL 23 I am working with my silver dealer and UPS to get to the bottom of this. I understand the value to this community to learn the truth from this. I still don't have all the facts, but when I do, I will come back here and share as much as I safely can. As of now, I'll just say it has gotten even more interesting. A reasonable (harmless) explanation has been proposed to me, but there are still some details that don't quite make sense.

CONCLUSION JUL 31: Good ending. According to the silver dealer that I bought from, the suspicious guy, DC, is their customer. He ordered from them (under a slightly different name?). UPS gave out the wrong tracking number. The first 10 digits are a given match because it is the same shipper, but due some glitch, the tracking # that DC was given spit out MY shipping information. I have since had some friendly conversations with DC and may have lunch with him. I am 95% convinced he is a nice friendly fellow. He is a little absent-minded and has recently ordered product from many different dealers (which could explain why he didn't correctly identify what he was looking for). He is a normal guy other than having a few wacky thoughts about how the government is conspiring to rob people by devaluing the US dollar and how a few corrupt elite are taking away people's freedoms, crazy stuff like that ;)",,False,self,t5_2t1b5,1375287242.0,,,True,t3_1iuf50,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1iuf50/attempted_scam_after_silver_delivery_sort_of/,

I look a little closer and realize... its a pile of eisenhowers.  Asked the cashier if I could buy them from her and she was more than delighted and I left my number because apparently they get them several times a week and they are a huge pain for them to deal with.

We have decided to make a few tweaks to the sidebar and in doing so we thought it would be good to have you speak your minds with other ideas or enhancements.

First, The list of ""Reputable Silver Dealers"" is a list of the commonly used and talked about silver dealers here.  So you will see this list change over time.  Most recently there have been various complaints about Goldmart and we have decided to remove them from the sidebar but still leave them in the Wiki Page.  My main beef with them is that listed on the Better Business Bureau's website they were given an ""F"" rating because on 3 occasions they were reported and failed to satisfy the customer.  To me this is unacceptable to recommend to others.  All other companies that we list have an ""A-"" or better.  I like goldmart, I will continue to personally use them, but I feel that there are more deserving retailers that should have the spot on the sidebar.

Second, /u/GasStationSushi has put some great effort in our [Silverbugs Wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/wiki/index) and I hope everyone had a chance to check it out.  To make it more visible we have been discussing putting a link to it on the sidebar.  If you would like to give him an applause, you may do so here.

Thirdly, One bug had mentioned that our list of silver dealers is biased towards the US.  I agree that it would be good to include retailers from other nations, But I would only want to include them if we can get several people to vouch for the business.  So hopefully our bugs abroad can help us out here.

Finally, If you have anything else to say on our sidebar please voice your concerns or ideas here. 

And No! We can't put the spot price on the front page.

A gallery of various things I've cast in silver. Many are ""first attempts"" just to get an idea what the item would look like. Any of them can be recreated (pun intended) assuming I can find that little rose quartz bar.

Future attempts have improved greatly (except the bear claw and the silverbug which are currently unique) but with any hand cast and hand finished item, each one will be slightly different from the next.

The bear claw is 150g and everything else is under 1oz. I'd be willing to recreate anything for a fellow silverbug provided costs are covered (silver and shipping mostly). I'm willing to use your silver or mine. Anything beyond that, I consider a ""tip"". Tips are not requested, required, but sure as hell won't be refused ;)

note: I tend to round down and understate purity. Let's say I cast a 20.5g item out of a batch that was assayed to 95%. I would call it 20g and .925. The intent is you get more than what you pay for.

If you're interested in any of these items, or have something you'd like cast in silver, let me know...I'm sure there's something I can do. I'm willing to attempt to cast just about anything. 

I also accept silver, gold, litecoin, bitcoin or paypal.

I wanted to make a suggestion to add a FAQ to the sidebar.  As someone who has been here since we were less than 1000 members, I have seen the same questions over and over.

* I have __________.  If I take it out of the package will it loose value?

* I want to clean my 1883 CC Morgan Silver dollar (NO DONT DO IT).  Will it lose value?

* Should I buy rounds or bars?

* Why pay the premium on ASEs or CMLs?

* Is ____________ a reputable dealer?  Has anyone purchased from them?

* How do you store your silver?

* What safe should I buy?

* What is the deal with sterling?  Does anyone stack it?  What if I melt it down?


The list goes on and on.  In an effort to (1) clear the board for more quality posts and keep it free of clutter (2) to genuinely help those who are seeking answers and are new to silver, we should make a FAQ.

Also, I splurged for a fiji taku because its the prettiest of the major ones imo.

I grabbed $600 out of my account and hit bank #1. 

I'd decided I was going to do Half Dollars, but I'd do dimes if they didn't have any. Bank #1 had no half rolls, but did have 10 rolls of dimes. Alright, it's a start.

Bank #2 was on my way home so I stopped in, they had a lot, so I got $500 worth. 

I decide to head home now and begin cracking these rolls. I figured I'd be happy finding about $20 in mixed silver. I fly threw the dimes...nothing. Next up, the halves. First roll, one right in the middle, a 1967 (only 40%, but i'll take it!). Next roll...entirely 40%. Two rolls in and already twenty-one 40%'ers..damn! When all was said and done.....162 40% halves, and 1 90% (a 1950 franklin). Yes..one hundred and sixty two 40% halves out of $500. There were several rolls that were nothing but silver. Others were sporadically mixed. Several BU 1968/1969's. I'm guessing someone found their grandparents stash and just cashed them in at the bank. 

Needless to say I went back to said bank and asked for another $500...absolutely nothing. Not one silver coin. The first $500 was hand rolled, the 2nd $500, machine rolled. I'm going to go back tomorrow for another $500 and asked for Hand Rolled. 

First time doing this..I don't think I should expect the same results as box #1 very often.

We will be holding a contest to come up with the next generation look and feel of this subreddit. Do you have great ideas for a new header and logo? Upload them to imgur and post them in a comment to this thread. The mods will chose the top entries, and we will hold a vote next week to chose the best set.

Entries should include:

1. A header
2. A logo
3. A screenshot of a subreddit with your design in place (can include additional CSS)

You have until Sunday feb 17th at midnight EST to submit your entry. Multiple entries are allowed, as long as there is significant difference between them.

The winner will receive:

* a silver Washington quarter from le me 
* a barber dime from /u/nugget9k
* 1962 Mexico Un Peso 1968 Canada 10 Cent x2 from /u/zuizide
* [1/10 oz liberty](http://imgur.com//kHRMCEU) from /u/GrymmWRX
* One silver dime from our cetacea loving friend /u/I_Fuck_Whales
* (if anyone else would like to sponsor the competition and sweeten the pot please let me know)

Some tips:

Headers' width and height are variable. They can be center, left, or right aligned, include padding, margin, and more. I suggest creating your own secret subreddit and practicing on it (you will need to for the screenshot). If you need any help with the css for positioning, coloring, etc. please reach out to me, I'll be happy to help anyone with it.",,False,self,t5_2t1b5,1360945576.0,,,True,t3_18b5ax,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/18b5ax/silverbugs_logo_and_header_design_contest/,moderator

I hadnt gotten into silver early enough to jump on the debt and death coins (as I probably would have been all over) but searching, I could only find few (unimpressive) skull coins/bars etc. I did take note of the small hand poured skull and cross bone bars floating around, but I am truly surprised there isnt more of this.

It's become obvious that we are at a standstill on our design a round contest.  It seems to me that a major aspect of this is that there are still plenty of unanswered questions and things that are up in the air.  We still don't know what we are allowed to include as far as representing ourselves as a community hosted by reddit.  

We also don't know who will be creating the designs once we are at a point to move forward with our community selected winning designs that we can all agree on represent us the best.

I would argue that, if our designs are good enough, then who cares who makes them...where can I get some should be the question.  We obviously want to get them done at a bargain price, but what if we have a design sweet enough that reputable dealers would be willing to offer them?

I don't have any financial stake at all in this project going forward...other than the blanks I have offered so far as prizes.  I just want to see some designs that capture who we are on silver, and I have seen some [designs already posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1e5bb4/contest_design_a_999_1_ozt_rsilverbugs_round_and/) that I would love to have in my stack.  I just want this to be a win for as many people as possible.  

I realize that some of you have a distaste for this 'custom round fad', but I would argue that having our own user-generated bullion would add credibility and visibility to our community.  We could get people interested and help grow in a positive way, which I think we can all agree would be a good thing.

The text below is from /u/slim_chance who graciously donated the awesome prize. If the winner doesn't want a Ron Paul round, either myself or /u/slim_chance will send you something else. I'm sure one of us can come up with something acceptable for you. All that being said, here are the details.

*****

I'd like to hear your reason for stacking.

The winner of this contest will win [this 1oz Ron Paul round](http://imgur.com/a/alDVK), so put on your thinking caps. All you have to do is write an essay on why you stack silver. Sounds easy, right? Well, here's the catch:

You're not allowed to use the word ""Silver.""

And you are limited to only six words.

As far as rules, the best use of six words will be the winner, whether it's funny, thought-provoking, or insightful. We'll limit submissions to one entry per person (with accounts &gt;1 month old). This contest is sold by weight, not by volume, and the use of memes is discouraged (for example: bitchez). Entries must be exactly 6 words, not contain the word silver, and form a complete sentence (or two, or six, but each must be complete sentences). Some leeway will be given on that last bit.

The contest will end Monday morning at 3:00 am on July 1st, NY time (Midnight for the west-coasters), with the winner announced after reasonable deliberation. (Worldwide entries permitted if you're good with it, I'll send them an ASE if they're not that into Ron Paul).

Some examples would be:

""The JPMorgan, the, except in German.""

""Inflation-proof, bank-proof, bailout-proof: it's time-tested wealth.""

""Metals make me merry and mirthful.""",,False,self,t5_2t1b5,1372693569.0,,,True,t3_1h4zso,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1h4zso/contest_dont_steal_the_government_hates/,moderator

I purchased 21 1oz coins off of a personal friend for spot value, he decided the value of silver wan't going up the way he had initially planned, plus he needed the cash, so I was more than happy to take it off of his mind.  He had 20 Libertads and 1 ASE, all of which he had purchased through GoldEagleCoins.  Now, I can finally comprehend why women are happy when they get jewelry.  I love my shinies, and it makes fiat currency look and feel worthless in comparison.  

I use the Kcast Gold Live! widget on my Android phone and glance at the price of silver once or twice a day.  I'm 22 and I've been busting my ass off at my two jobs, working 80 hours a week, pinching every penny I can until I can buy another 20oz roll of ASE's, maybe CML's.  It sure feels like, and I very much hope, that I'm doing the right thing.  I've read Ron Paul, Mike Maloney, watched SBSS, and have Peter Schiff's books lined up and ready to read.  Looking at my savings account, it does trouble me that my purchase dipped me below the 4-digit mark.  It pains me that I'll have to bust more ass before I can make another purchase, but there simply isn't another option.  This is the best safety net for if I have a medical emergency, otherwise it is far too tempting for me to spend what I've earned.  The name of the game is to preserve existing wealth.  I'm sure there will be a whole lot more newcomer threads in this subreddit for the months and years to come.

I'm Ademo - the only employee - of Suns of Liberty Mint besides ""Silver Dave"" the founder. We're a new mint but have been making hand poured pieces for years. 

Recently, we've launched our signature product the ""Fine Silver Quarter."" This is 1/4 ozt, square shaped, .99+ piece. They are made using .999 fs and cost the same as your traditional - yet boring - Silver Eagle. Yet, you get four pieces. 

We're excited by the feedback and orders since June's launch of the ""Fine Silver Quarters."" We'll be designing the 1 ozt pieces soon and will follow it up with a 1/10 ozt piece. 

You can find out more about us at http://sunsoflibertymint.com . I understand that some in this group have already heard about our ""Quarters."" We thank you for your business. 

If you have any other questions feel free to ask or contact myself via the site.

Is it worth anything?

I currently have no interest in the numismatic side of collecting and am stacking mostly for the metal itself.  I'm drawn to OPM's stuff for the low price over spot, the fact it's produced right near-ish to me and I think their ""industrial"" designs are quite striking.

So I guess my question is what do you guys gravitate toward and does the premium of branded bullion also (hopefully) appreciate or is a $2.50 premium spent now going to (likely) sell for the same $2.50 in 20 years?

Also, what makes a brand a ""brand"" vs a ""generic""?  What's the difference between OPM and PAMP Suisse, for instance?",,False,self,t5_2t1b5,False,,,True,t3_1jvyps,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1jvyps/generic_vs_branded_bullion/,

Got excited after waking up and seeing the new spot price, so I showered early and headed there before work. As I pull into the parking lot I notice the OPEN sign not lit up. Walking toward the door I look at the store hours, know I'm not mistaken and wait for the door to be unlocked. I check the door myself and it opens as the owner is walking towards me. Has a forced smile on his face and asks if there's anything he can help me with. I immediately notice no coins or bars around and ask him if he has any.

He tells me that he's been robbed multiple times this past month and that his store was actually broken into last weekend again. Says he's packing up shop and that the thieves were particular in stealing all of his silver-he doesn't have a single thing of silver left. He asks if i'm interested in gold at all and I decline and apologize for his misfortunes. 

It was more of an Antique/Coin/Jewelry shop, but right off the freeway and I'm guessing an easy target in large because of the location.

That makes about 1lb of sterling and 5oz of .999 on hand (plus 18x 40% halves I don't really care much for)

Since I'll be getting that acetylene torch, casting should be much easier since ill be able to get the silver significant hotter.  This will open up a wide range of capabilities such as:

Casting other metals (copper, palladium, gold) in larger amounts. This means the possibility of larger castings.

Ingot casting with more professional results (cast your old junk into bars).",,False,self,t5_2t1b5,False,,,True,t3_1f2v6t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/1f2v6t/sterling_is_back_in_stock/,
