At worst, I imagined someone ""donating"" to their weed dealer; at best, $20 to a charity and an interesting story behind it.

This was not to be the case.  At the cost of $38 *per month*, my Santa is sponsoring a child - potentially for many years - through Compassion International.

It is so horribly cliche that *this* is really what the season is all about; selfless giving, concern for others, helping your fellow man that when individuals *do* break the norm, it is frequently under-appreciated.  Not by me, man, not by me.

Your act of generosity has inspired me to do the same.  I'll also be sponsoring a child through CI, for as long as I can afford it.  Through your actions, you've helped two kids, not just one.

There is a lot of stuff we can and will improve on (more on this in the weeks to come) but I'd like to acknowledge the volunteers that make help make this work.  Everyone take a moment and give a virtual round of applause to these fine people:

_(in alphabetical order):_

---------------------------

**[BaconBiscuits](http://www.reddit.com/user/baconbiscuits)**

BaconBiscuits is one of our fearless mods.  She happens to be on a different continent that the rest of us which has its benefits and disadvantages.  She helps out when all of us are probably asleep but also has to go at it alone, which is a scary thing sometimes!  She is proactive, great at communicating in our subreddit and also helps to give out awards on redditgifts!

**Cheers BaconBiscuits, we love what you do!**

---------------------------

**[someguyfromcanada](http://www.reddit.com/user/someguyfromcanada)**

SOMEGUYFROMCANADA sends me funny emails late at night and volunteers in so many ways it's ridiculous.  He is constantly helping out community members and making sure things are running smoothly.  He also goes through every freaking gift in the gallery giving awards  (seriously, it is insane).  In addition to this I need to call out a role he took this year that is probably unknown but now we need to scream it from the rooftops:

SOMEGUYFROMCANADA singlehandedly made the whole Guinness world record thing happen.  He made it his personal project before we actually got paid to do redditgifts.  He got tweet campaigns together, sent emails to them, basically he harassed them until they could no longer ignore us.  Without him, we wouldn't be doing this world record thing.  After we get the record, he will be getting a framed world record plaque!  

**Everyone raise your glass to an A+ community and team member!  **

---------------------------


**[weffey](http://www.reddit.com/user/weffey)**

Weffey is one of those rare people that reminds you that you aren't doing enough by the sheer amount of stuff she is able to get done in a day.  Weffey (like the others mentioned here) is a long time participant and reddit member.  She is in constant contact with me about stuff going on here.  I get IMs from her at all times of the day and she is constantly keeping me on my toes.  Weffey is probably the most prominent award giver and is the person managing the whole awards thing.  Not to mention, she probably reads every single post and comment in our subreddit here (seriously).

**Weffey, you are the oil that makes this machine run!**

**Everyone join me -- HIP HIP, HOORAY!**

The shipping deadline is December 14th, but we hope you’ll ship before then!

**Announcement**

This year we have released a big new addition to redditgifts that we call the **[redditgifts marketplace](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/)**.  Before you ask, NO, it is not required that you use the marketplace when you participate in a redditgifts exchange.  However, we think you’ll find it convenient and over time we will get a really big list of people selling their products to make it a great place for all of your gift giving needs.  In the meantime, we have put together a pretty great list of reddit friendly merchants to help us get off the ground.  Take a look around and buy a gift for your secret santa match, a family member or even yourself!

**Why should you use the marketplace?**

 First, it will make your exchange process easier.  We’ll fill in the address for you and mark it shipped for you when it is shipped!

 Second, you’ll be supporting redditgifts!  We are a staff of 3, full time employees and your support through the marketplace will ensure that redditgifts stays around for years to come.

 Third, the stuff in the marketplace is pretty freaking cool!  

And don’t forget, we have a VERY limited edition [reddit Secret Santa T-shirt](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/rsecretsanta-shirt/) for sale until Deecember 1st.  This is a perfect gift for anyone!",,False,self,t5_2rc6h,False,,elfhat,True,t3_13tpu1,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/13tpu1/matching_has_been_completed_let_the_games_begin/,moderator

Got this from my SS. Help a redditor, his wife and his developing baby out!
------------------------------------------------------------------
You're going to do exactly as I say, if not - I'm cancelling your gift, I'm holding your cat random, I'm headed to your parent's house to smash up your Mustang and I'm going to buy your wife the largest pair of pants Motherhood Maternity has to offer. I'm talking parachute status here.

You're going to make a post in /r/secretsanta and within that post you are going to include your wife's Steam ID. Oh, she doesn't have a steam account? FUCKING MAKE HER ONE! Then, you are going to do your damnedest to get that post to the Secret Santa front-page. Quote this message, I don't care.

I've already hooked you up and prepped you/wife for the upcoming child, I feel like I need to do something special for your wife (who's about to go through some of the shittiest-best months of her life). By the way, my wife fucking loved chocolate and peanut butter, invest in Reese's (and the best blowjobs of my life were during the week after the baby was born).

So, no screwing around - make it happen, or on 3 June 2011 - me, your brother, and Flogging Molly are going to trash your place, steal all your booze, and hang Sarah Palin posters on the wall. And I'll poop in your rock climbing shoes.

I noticed some of them wrote that they plan on giving their gift to someone else because they already have too many of a particular items or a ""better quality"" product. 

Example: 'Oh I love these tennis balls that you sent me because I am an avid tennis player but I already have tennis balls that are more high end and have enough of them to last me until the zombies take over. So i'm going to give these to someone else who isn't as into tennis but a novice who doesn't need the higher quality'

I'm not sure why but it bothered me. I mean yah it's good to give something to someone else when you know you aren't going to use it instead of it sitting and gathering dust. But is it really necessary to post it for your SS to read. Maybe they put a lot of thought into your gift or maybe not. I don't know it just bothered me and I wasn't even the SS.

If you were sent something like ... *4 paperclips for instance* ... we will look into it, but if you just don't like your gift, please say thank you and make your santa feel good!

I'm sure everyone on the entirety of Reddit has now seen the letter DoctorYuyi received from their original Secret Santa and I just wanted to post a message to everyone in regards to it.

As you're all aware of the situation that occurred, I suppose I can just get down to business. No one should ever have to subject to such hateful, unacceptable behaviour or disgusting abuse. I think we can all agree on that. Also any sort of hateful behaviour like this will be taken very seriously by the team, we do not take this sort of thing lightly.

But in relation to the exchange itself, I would just to reiterate something very, very important. This isn't directed at anyone in particular, but more as a sort of reminder to everyone generally:

This exchange is comprised of around 39,000 people from all different backgrounds, religions, beliefs and lifestyles. And it is entirely wrong for anyone involved to judge people based on these things. It doesn't matter what your own beliefs about their lifestyle is, that's not what you're there to judge. What you signed up for was to give a gift to a random stranger related to something they liked, not to judge them for who they are. So who cares maybe if they're an atheist and you're religious, or if they maybe aren't fond of something and you are or whatever; it is in no way anyone's place to say that their match is right or wrong and it is on a whole new level of wrong to actually send a letter like the one received earlier. 

The user who wrote the letter has been banned and removed from the exchange and DoctorYuyi has been rematched. Hopefully their new match is awesome! So I think what we should all do now, is offer our support, learn from what has happened and carry on with our awesome exchange!

Thanks everyone, hope everything is going well c:",,False,self,t5_2rc6h,True,,elfhat,True,t3_myviq,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/myviq/in_light_of_recent_events/,moderator

So, I was able to find on ebay a package that included Kardashian nail polish and Beiber perfume/teddy bear. I thought it was a perfect combination of things that she would like. Then the ebay seller contacts me, and apologizes- but they have to substitute the bear for another Justin Beiber teddy bear. I told her that was no problem- I personally could bear-ly tell them apart. The ebay seller still feels bad, and wants to include something extra in the package, and asks me what I would like. I tell her that I don't know a whole lot about Beiber or Kardashian's, and that she literally knows as much about the person receiving the gifts as I do. She was confused by this- and probably fairly creeped out that I would be buying Beiber paraphanalia for someone I'd never met. I explained Reddit SS, and she thought it was so cool- and wanted to help me out. 

She got in contact with an old friend of hers, that is Kim Kardashian's hair stylist- and was able to add an autographed photo to the package. I thought it was so cool, and so did the giftee! Thanks Ebay lady.

I always knew that this would be an awesome event to participate in and how potentially awesome having a santa might be. But tonight, Reddit has shown me how amazing people are. 

When I got home today after work and collected my mail there was an unidentifiable letter...until I turned it around and saw an orangered! It's from Reddit!!! What! Wow! I then momentarily thought about exercising some self-discipline, but haha, who's kidding who here...I tore it open and delightfully found three pages of *handwritten* letter to engulf myself in! The last time I actually received a handwritten letter was...I don't even remember. I won't go into the details, but by the time I got to the middle of the second page, the tears were flowing. Maybe I was overreacting, but the thought of this perfect stranger taking the time to write me this incredibly sweet letter was ... well ....amazing. This person, my santa, took the time to write me a beautiful letter and they don't even know me. At the end of the letter, my santa wrote: ""I hope this made your day a little better - if not, save it for a day when you need it."" Well, this just made my day. A WHOLE lot. 

Thank you santa, you are a very special person and I'm so glad you are my santa :) Can't wait for the other things!

**edit**: some of you were asking for a bit of the letter I received that was so amazing. I'd be happy to share some of it (I didn't include it before because I didn't want to bore you guys lol).



* ""Dear Becka, This is Santa. Before trained narwhals pulled your alias out from the ""names of redditors"" soup, I vowed to write you an actual handwritten letter. Santa's last grandparents died this year. These were the last people that Santa sat down to write actual letters to mail for. Those letters were written years ago before twitters and iPhones. Hopefully you are excited to receive this letter as much as they would have"". YES I was just as excited. 

* ""All in all, you are an amazing person. Somebody who makes the world a better place just by being in it. You are someone your friends and family always love even if they don't show or say it. You are so good at being you- don't let anyone tell you or make you think differently. You are a beautiful person inside and out. I'm happy to have been matched with you"". 

Santa, I hope you don't mind that I posted some of your letter. I'm just very proud of it and you!

When you get a match, you spend money on trying to find an amazing gift for someone, you spend money on shipping. The most frustrating thing in the world is when they do not even post your gift or confirm receiving it. For the last couple of matches I've had to submit proof to the admins of actually purchasing and shipping my gift... and it feels really bad. 

If you are one of these people that just doesn't care enough to thank the person, or even CONFIRM that you received one, please do us all a favor and don't participate because it ruins the experience. I understand some people get busy and can't post right away, but leaving it for over a month... Because of these constant burns I have decided not to participate in anymore exchanges... and it sucks because it was a fun and interesting thing to do. 

I am a student with very little money. Please appreciate and respect people enough to actually post the hard work that they have put into putting together a gift for you.

I apologize for the rant.

tldr; confirm your gift and stop being lazy. It feels terrible for the person to have to submit proof after putting in hard work.

While redditgifts is about the giving, we want to do everything possible to make sure that you also receive a gift, and a good gift.  We have a ton of changes planned that we will be making and announcing over the next 2 months or so, but this is the announcement for the first change, to matching.

In our matching process from now on, we will be making an extra effort to take care of people who were shafted in previous exchanges.  Let me explain:

In order to qualify as a shafted participant, we will look at the most recent exchange you participated in that is ""completed"".  A completed exchange is what we do after we've sent out all the emails and given people adequate time to prove shipping and report non received.  Generally this is about 24 days after the shipping deadline.  You must have also marked your gift not received to be considered shafted.  This means you went to the link on redditgifts that says ""No gift?"", and does NOT mean you posted to the gallery saying you didn't get anything.  *remember though, when you report your gift not received, we ask the sender for proof, so if you lie ... we will research.*

So, if you are one of these shafted people, here's what we are going to do:

We are going to make our best effort to match you to a known good gifter.  What is a known good gifter?  That is someone who in their last completed exchange, marked a gift as shipped that was also posted to the gallery.

We will also let your gifter know that you were shafted previously.

Stay tuned for a whole bunch of new things in the coming months!",,False,self,t5_2rc6h,False,,elfhat,True,t3_1c7pbv,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/1c7pbv/announcement_we_are_changing_our_matching_process/,moderator

Gifts. Redective - The Reddit Detective.",NoShirtNoShoesNoDice,399,64,188,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/12y33l/i_just_finished_creating_a_small_site_to_help/,"http://www.redective.com/

The idea for the site came to me last year when a friend of mine was participating in the Reddit Secret Santa 2011. I remember her saying that it was so difficult figuring out something to buy because it involved really digging deep into a Redditor's profile. One year later I decided to do something about it. [Redective](http://www.redective.com/) is the result! :)

-------------------

**EDIT**

Many changes have been made including the ability to search the frontpage or specific subreddits! Enjoy :)

-------------------

**What does it do?**

It scours Reddit and tabulates the data it can find about your Reddit Secret Santa and displays them to you in a simple form. You can sort every single column and use the filter system (the ""Filter Results"" link at the top once you've performed a search) to only find what you really want.

**What else does it do?**

As well as Redective doing its examining thing, it gives you the option of searching Google, Reddit and Reddit Gifts automatically just by selecting the appropriate method before clicking the Search button.

**How does it work?**

Head on over to http://www.redective.com/ and you will see a box to enter a username. Type in the username of your Reddit Secret Santa then click the Search button. That's it. Redective will take care of the rest. The more active a Redditor is, the longer it will take to get the data, so you may have to be patient. The results you get are:

* *Subreddits*: Want to know where your user generally posts? As an example, apparently I hang out in /r/gaming, /r/movies and /r/PHP. Is that me? Absolutely. I watch movies, play games and I'm a PHP web developer. From that I can see exactly what I should get myself this year :)

* *Word Frequencies*: Perhaps it's best to figure out what your Secret Santa likes by looking at the words they most frequently use? All common words that I could think of are automatically excluded (such as 'the','and','no','yes',etc) so only those that are relevant should be displayed. What are my most common words? 'never', 'always', 'movie'. erm. Never and Always cancel each other out, so let's go with movies.

* *Hours Active*: Find out what hours (according to your computer's timezone) your user is generally active. This is a novelty feature that probably isn't very useful, but I included it because I think it's fun.

* *Overview*: An overview of every comment and submission that Redective could find. It's helpful to see exactly what the user gets karma for so you have more of an idea of their specific interests.

**Does it work?**

It seems to work. I've tested it on a Windows machine using [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) and all of them worked great. I've also tested on an Android phone using both the default Android browser and Opera Mobile, and both work fine.

I don't see why it wouldn't work for anyone, but I get this sneaking suspicion that it will fail with Internet Explorer. If you are using Internet Explorer, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE consider an alternative. As a professional web developer, supporting Internet Explorer is one of the most frustrating parts of my job. Help de-stress me by switching :)

**What are those options?**

The options allow you to customize how Redective works. Generally you won't need to change any of these, but you are free to do whatever you feel with the exception of the *Wait Seconds* option which I have set an absolute minimum of 2 seconds between requests to the Reddit server. After all, we don't want to hurt Reddit :) I've set it to 3 seconds by default.

-------------------

I **really** hope people find it useful and above all, I hope it helps with your gift giving this year! :)

- Lots of people will not ship by December 6th because they know they have extra time to get it there before the 25th.  
- Also, LOTS of people on reddit are college kids who have exams right now. Kickme may have made the 6th the deadline but Secret Santa can't be their priority just yet. 
- Gift givers: unless its a paperclip or toxic waste YOUR GIFT IS GOOD ENOUGH. The suggested cost of a gift PLUS shipping is supposed to be around $15. Anything beyond that is gravy. There is no expectation that your gift to a stranger on reddit be better than what you will be giving to your real life loved ones.

Here's the thing--the point of these exchanges is to stalk your giftee and have fun picking out cool and thought out gifts for them, NOT to worry about the state of your own gift. Focus on the part of the exchange you have control over, and realize that some of us like to keep our giftee in the dark up until we ship because it's fun to surprise them with an awesome gift.  You don't need a message, you don't need to get your gift weeks ahead of the ship date, and you don't need to constantly worry about what you're getting.  What you do need to worry about is making someone else happy with a well thought out present.  Are some people going to get shafted?

I later received a message from an amazing [redditor](http://www.reddit.com/user/Logical_Phallusy/) telling me that he wanted to get me a gift. I told him what I really needed was a bed and he told me to go pick one out and he would order it online.

I was skeptical but I went to mattress firm and found a bed I liked and sent him the link. The bed got [here](http://i.imgur.com/poTJB.jpg) yesterday.

Back in March my bed got stolen along with pretty much everything I owned so I have been sleeping on my little brother's bed for a while.
Not only did he finally get his bed back so he won't have to sleep on the uncomfortable couch anymore, but for the first time in my life I have a brand new bed. The awesome Redditor didn't tell me to get a little cheapo bed either, he told me to get something comfortable that I could use for years. 

I'm still trying to accept the fact that the only gifts I got for Christmas this year were from two random strangers on the internet. I got re matched and my new Secret [santa](http://www.reddit.com/user/p00ndawg/) sent me a beautiful painting almost immediately. 

You are both awesome and really made the last week of 2010 awesome. Thank You :)

So we held the shoot yesterday and it was a total blast. The model, Meliza, did a great job and my Secret Santa, Redditor sounds_like_yon, was a great teacher. At first I was really uncomfortable telling Meliza what to do, but by the end of the two hours everyone was really working well together. 

We took tones of pictures of course, but here are some of my favorites from the shoot. Feedback is welcome.

This was definitely one of my best Christmas presents ever. Thanks Reddit!

Edit: [Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/28289918@N06/sets/72157625862176113/) is a Flickr gallery in case anyone can't follow the original link.

What I learned:

1. A gray background (even a white one) can come out white or black depending on the set-up.

2. In studio photography, shutter speed is much less important than shooting in available light.

3. There are a hell of a lot of ways to light a subject. I won't go into all of them here, though. 

4. It's important to have some clear ideas of what you want to accomplish well before you start. 

5. Sometimes the best looking poses involve exaggerated postures and are the most unnatural/uncomfortable for the model. 

Interesting side notes:

1. The gas mask and the knife were supplied by the SS's friend who also came to help out.

2. The bubble gun quit at the start of the shoot. The one we got was a random shot during set up when Meliza was just playing around.

3. We only got 3 candy shots and none of them was perfect. There was one where Meliza came out great but the candy wasn't in frame, and there was one where the candy was good but Meliza was out of focus/bllurred. I had to Photoshop the two together.",,False,self,t5_2rc6h,True,,,True,t3_fg9k8,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/fg9k8/my_rematch_taught_me_studio_photography_he_rented/,

I'm a university student, living in my first apartment with some friends, and, like everyone else, I signed up for secret santa cause I like getting people cool gifts and this is a neat idea. Well. 

First I began receiving some mysteriously amusing Christmas cards - attached were paperclips, random letters of the alphabet (spelling out AACCDK...), and dates from november 26th to december 1st. Six cards in total. Me and my housemates put the cards up around the house, cause they're hilarious - a dog humping santa's leg is my favourite. 

This house decor would've sufficed, but clearly that's not all. My secret santa messaged me, informing me that he already sent out some ""troll gifts"" and my real present was ready, but he worried that I would have to pay the tax on international shipping. So what did he do? He drove to Montreal from New Jersey to ship it using the Canadian postal service. I thought that was ridiculously kind of him, but turns out his kindness gets EVEN MORE RIDICULOUS. 

I missed the package yesterday, and went to pick it up at the post office today. The french postal clerk was alarmed by the size, it was giant, and didn't think I could carry it home. Well, she was right, so I came back to pick it up by car.  

I opened it up having NO idea what could be inside. Turns out the box was filled with individually wrapped smaller items. It was like opening a treasure chest of awesome. One by one I took out:

* 5 posters
* 3 bags of starbucks coffee (MUCH NEEDED.)
* 8 CDs (including a No Doubt greatest hits CD, HOW DID HE KNOW ABOUT MY LONG TIME OBSESSION WITH ND?)
* A No Doubt videos DVD (how did he knowww)
* A 25 piece set of kitchen utensils (yesss)
* 4 sets of Ralph Lauren perfume/body lotion
* A where's waldo t-shirt!!
* The Onion's ""Our Front Pages""
* Stickers!
* Star Wars USB key
* An antistatic Wrist Strap (thanks for reading my previous comments =)) 
* and a Christmas Story Nightlight, probably the cutest thing I've ever seen.

The picture doesn't do these gifts justice - this is incredible. There's no way I can keep all of this - my friends are getting some stuff so this is like a donation to your Poor n' Stressed Canadian Students Society. 

I don't know your reddit username, but captain James T Kirk, I am beyond grateful. Thank you so much - you singlehandedly made my Christmas 2010.

Love, a fellow female SSer",pippx,362,70,283,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/e5ohy/dear_fellow_ssers_getting_matched_with_a_girl_is/,"I've read a few comments in /r/SecretSanta and remember seeing quite a few last year expressing fears in being matched with a girl.

For those of you who have this fear, **please** keep the following in mind:

* Remember that we are girls *on reddit!* That means there is a decent chance that we are into some of the same stuff as you. I've only met a few girls on reddit who are super duper girly types and aren't into things like LEGO and gaming and science and nerd-tivities, but they are far and few between. **DON'T PANIC.**

* Shopping for a girl is not all that different than shopping for a guy. Get us something cool and interesting that will make us yell ""SCORE"" when we open it. The chances of you being paired with a girl who spends all her time on reddit talking about pantyhose and nail polish and PMS and chocolate is probably not too likely. Even a girl who *does* talk about those things over in 2X probably spends time in /r/books or /r/gaming, and would rather get something related to one of those interests instead of a gift card to, oh, say Bath and Body Works. **DON'T PANIC.**

* Stalk us just like you would stalk any other redditor. Don't read every comment and attach ""said she"" at the end of it. Better yet, if you realize your match is female, forget about it. Read her comments without bias, and remove any pronouns from your thinking. Instead of thinking, ""Hey, *she* really loved Harry Potter..... I guess I could buy her Harry Potter underwear or something..."" think, ""Hey, my match really loved all the Harry Potter books - I'll buy them this sweet handmade book cover from Etsy to keep their favourite one safe!"" (OK granted a book cover is probably a wee bit more feminine thing to buy than masculine, but you get my drift). **DON'T PANIC.**

In conclusion: we like cool shit. We like toys. We like games. We like things that are fun and different that will make us squeal with delight when we get to call it our own. And, most importantly, don't feel obligated to buy us something obviously feminine! **DON'T. PANIC!**

*edit:* I had no idea this post would get any amount of response comparable in volume to what I am seeing going on! That was way wordier than it needed to be, but I really am thrilled! Some excellent things have been noted throughout the comments, and I am so pleased to have added something to the spirit of SS. It would appear that the majority of female redditors agree with me on this, which is an epic win! It always makes me happy when I say something that tends to speak on behalf of all ____________________, so it's nice when it's actually seen as pretty accurate. 

**P.S.** While I wouldn't say that this is a *problem*, I would say that it has been, and continues to be, an active concern in the mind of the occasional male redditor. At least a third of the comments on here consist of ""Really!? That's a problem!?"" and my answer is always, ""Yes, really, that's why I posted this!""

This time three years ago, redditgifts was stoked to have 4300 people signed up. We’re incredibly excited at how the redditgifts community has grown and for the biggest Secret Santa yet!

A few quick points I want to get out of the way:

1. If you’ve emailed support and we haven’t gotten back to you yet, know that 5days has spent her weekend glued to the keyboard trying to make sure all the outstanding emails are taken care of.
2. The site **will be** under heavy load on Monday. We will do everything in our power to keep the site up, but if you start seeing “you've made a huge mistake”, know it’s most likely us, and not you. Give it a couple hours and try again.
3. Matching should be done mid-morning Mountain time. We’ll start sending out emails when it’s done.

**The Redditgifts Marketplace:**

With this year’s Secret Santa, we’re super excited to announce the **[redditgifts Marketplace](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/)**! We’ve been working with some awesome reddit friendly businesses to get their products available for purchase. You are not required to purchase your gifts through the marketplace, but we have worked full integration for the exchanges into the checkout process. When you check out, you’ll see a drop down in the top right hand corner with your exchange matches. Then, when you pick the desired giftee, we’ll pre-fill in the shipping info, and finally, when the business marks your items as shipped, we’ll even mark your exchange gift as shipped, and let your giftee know something is on its way!  **Please support redditgifts by using the marketplace for your holiday shopping this year!**


Common questions that will come up over the next few days:

- **When do I need to ship by?** December 14th. If you can’t ship by then, you can message your giftee and let them know. That doesn't mean you can ship on January 14th and not get in trouble, it means if you’re going to be a couple days late, that’s ok.
- **Can I change the likes and dislikes I put in when I signed up?** Yep, just go to [this page](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2012/settings/).
- **Can I ask my giftee questions?** Absolutely! To the right of their address on the ‘retrieve match’ page, there’s a link to send them an anonymous message through redditgifts. No throwaway account required!
- **How much do I need to spend?** We [recommend](http://redditgifts.com/faq/#how-much-am-i-expected-to-spend) spending 20$ USD, but some people chose to spend more. Remember, just because you chose to spend more doesn’t mean the person buying for you will. 
- **Is the person I'm sending to the person who's sending me a gift in return?** No, unless it happens by pure chance [the person you are gifting to is not the person gifting to you](http://redditgifts.com/faq/#how-are-we-matched-up).
- **What was the name of that site I could use to look up someone’s reddit activity?** Because redditors are awesome, there’s a couple. We’ve [linked to them](http://redditgifts.com/faq/#ive-received-my-match-now-what) in the FAQ. 
- **Something’s come up and I can’t participate any more, how to I back out?** There is a [cancel participation](http://redditgifts.com/faq/#can-i-cancel-my-participation) link on your exchange status page. You MUST do it BEFORE matching. Once matching has happened, we can’t back you out.

T-Shirt Exchange and Pokemon Exchange. Both of those have come and gone, I'd sent my gifts out and my giftees both loved their gifts!

 I did get my gift from my T-Exchange but I never received a gift from the Pokemon Exchange. It didn't really bother me too much, after a month or so after the ship by deadline passed I got a message saying my gifter had sent their package but after another few weeks of it not showing up, I figured they either lied or it was lost.

Fast-forward to two days ago I got a package in the mail with my Reddit name on the address label so immediately I assumed it was the Pokemon Exchange I had been waiting for. Once I opened it and saw what it was, I couldn't believe it! A brand new Nintendo 3DS XL!! I was shocked. I opened it up and started playing with it right then, I'd never had a handheld game system before and this was VERY cool. It totally made my day if not my week!

Then, later that night I logged onto Reddit to post the greatest gift I'd ever gotten from an exchange to notice I had a message waiting to be read. And quickly I realized after the first sentence I was going to be quite disappointed.

I made a small album of the package and the message.
http://imgur.com/a/evWeH#0

After reading the message I knew I had to get this back to the rightful owner as much as it pained me to pack it back up and ship it away. A couple messages back and forth and I had Nintendo on it's way the next day to the right person. He was very nice through the messages and very promptly sent me a payment through paypal to cover the shipping and a little extra for the trouble. After it all though, it made for a pretty funny story.

TL;DR: An Ex-Gifter accidentally sent me a Nintendo 3DS to tease me :(

the first two links that come up are as follows:

instantly, she started laughing hysterically and my jaw dropped, appalled. through her laughing, she added ""you'll never get a job!"" which didn't concern me nearly as much as my secretsanta thinking i raped little kids. i rushed to reddit to try and clear this up. 

please upvote this so hopefully my secretsanta will read it and not send me a bomb in the mail.

she's still laughing. maybe i'll start going by william (my first name).

So I got her a machete and a stuffed bear to help her get through the coming zombie uprising. 

I arrived at her door assuming that she would not be home, but thought I would ring the door bell anyways. 

Well, I was right that she was not at home... but her biker-looking father was. There I was, a bigger guy, with a dirty beard and a reddit t-shirt on, as the I tried to explain to him that I didn't know his daughter, we meet online and that I just wanted to drop off a gift when it came to me... although I had the best intentions this looks really really really sketchy from an outside prospective. Good thing my girlfriend was in the car so I didn't look like a total creep, but I left the gifts and quickly left...

So, Reddit, the lesson I learned was always assume you match is under 18, and consider what your actions might look like from a outside prospective.

We all know you love indie makeup companies and that your neighbors love red cars (I removed the actual street view of my house) but since this gift is for Arbitrary reasons...you'll have to earn it. Put down that copy of ""Everyday Use"" by Alice Walker, turn down the M.I.A., finish chewing that slice of pound cake, swallow that last sip of Jamocha shake from Arby's and focus. 

Now, being a Sociology whiz from Georgia State University I'm sure you've already figured out where this is going... 

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make a post in /r/secretsanta. Then, you are going to do your darndest to get that post to the Secret Santa front-page. Quote this message, if that's what it takes. 

Fail to do so and I will destroy all chicken tetrazzini, square pizzas, 5 Guys burgers and cajun fries &amp; Chunky soup known in existence; I'll hide all of your plain yogurt and replace your M&amp;Ms with generic chocolate drops; I'll go down to that bakery near your house and buy up all the red velvet, hummingbird, and key lime cupcakes so you can't have any and I'll come into your store, buy something, and slide you my method of payment instead of handing it to you! 

So, no screwing around - make it happen, or I'll make you wait until February 24th...and then I'll call it a Birthday present...so take that! 

I hope this doesn't freak you out so much that you go grab your Addy doll...I'm actually hoping you'll think that this is cool and fun.

(my first gifting was fun though that's why i signed up for more)

All I can think is ""Well no wonder you didn't get anything the first time"". 

And I think my suggestion for helping fix that is either we should get to be picky when it's a rematch, since we're not obligated to. Or maybe there should be a requirement for the like/dislikes to actually have something written in it (with a minimum length) or those people are kicked out. Because I really enjoy the exchange and the rematching until I get someone who hasn't made an effort on their part, and I think it must be the same for others? 

Maybe another way to solve it is to have two exchanges, one that costs a high amount of credits (for proven gifters) and one that still costs 1 for people new to it who want to build their credits?

A year later, they brought on [me full time](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/10/introducing-three-new-hires.html) as a second devloper, and [garyjense to help us grow the marketplace](http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/1cvtaf/welcome_new_redditgifts_employee_garyjense/) just last month. Over the last few months, we’ve been working hard at bringing you more [great exchanges](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/), launched the [Marketplace](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/?source=elves_announce), and most recently brought back the [reddit shirts](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/shirts/reddit/?source=elves_announce). What you haven’t yet seen that we’ve been working on is, **[redditgifts Elves](http://redditgifts.com/elves/?source=elves_announce)**. 

Much like how redditgifts is a sister site to reddit, Elves is our version of [reddit gold](http://reddit.com/gold/). Over the years, many have wanted a way to support redditgifts and ensure the future of our efforts *(we hope to be able to do this for a long time)*.  With Elves, we are providing a way for you to contribute to the future of our happy society here on reddit.  In return, we’ve put together a list of great features that will only be available for elves!

- When signing up for exchanges, Elves can choose to be matched with other Elves.
- An easy way to submit exchange ideas, and comment and vote on the ideas already placed in the proverbial suggestion box.
- The power to give awards in the gallery to posted gifts.
- A special way to browse the gifts you’re following in the gallery.
- Flair in /r/SecretSanta.
- Access to a private elves subreddit where we will discuss upcoming exchanges, the future of redditgifts and general awesomeness
- A trophy on your reddit and redditgifts trophy cases that will signify your contribution to the future of redditgifts!
- For a limited time, we will be sending Elves who purchase a year long subscription [two special edition notebooks](https://d2npbuaakacvlz.cloudfront.net/images/elves/notebooks.jpg) made by [Miro](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/merchant/Miro/?source=elves_announce).

We are selling Elves in 3, 6, and 12 month packages for $9.99, $14.99, and $24.99 respectively. You can also buy Elves in a bundle with reddit gold at a discounted rate of $17.99, $30.99, and $44.99.

I want to stress, more than anything, redditgifts will remain free to use, if you chose to buy a subscription to Elves, much like reddit gold, we will be giving you extra features and some extra privileges on the site.

1338837383.0,247,self.secretsanta,uko0y,A gift for all of you - especially you who have been shafted!,viramola,267,20,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/uko0y/a_gift_for_all_of_you_especially_you_who_have/,"**Hello everyone!**

For my Cookbook Exchange 2012 I decided to make my very own cookbook with traditional Swedish cuisine - Swedish Plain Fare. 

My giftee liked it a lot, and have even cooked a few recipes from it.

Hanging out here on this subreddit and on Redditgifts I occasionally see those who have been shafted. Some who keep on giving, even though they have been giftless for several exchanges.

Well, had I the funds I'd make you all my rematch giftees. Instead I decided to share this cookbook as a gift to all of you.

Now, I'm an amateur cook, and first time ever cookbook maker. I cooked all the food myself, photodocumented it and did the layout. The recipes themselves are recipes that you find all over Sweden with different variations. 

Swedish Plain Fare is every day cuisine and is normally known as **Husmanskost**, husman being the word for homeowner.

So please, accept my humble gift. It's free and I want nothing for it! Download it, print it, toss it, share it, cook from it... it's yours. It's not huge, and I'm sure it has plenty of flaws but I've made it with love.

It's a big thank you from me to the wonderful people here. Please let me know if there's anything bad with the file, if you want higher resolution pdfs, something wrong with the recipes or if you want to ask about Swedish cuisine. 

*Puss och kram from Vira.*

**TL;DR I made a cookbook in English on Swedish traditional dishes and I wanted to give it to you, free to download on Dropbox**


Edit: I am floored by your reception of this. Waking up this morning and checking if I had any replies... it moved me. Thank you so much. 

Oh and I made it quite small so it would be easy to download, but let me know if you want me to add a bigger version if you yourself want to print it out. 

Edit 2: You guys. I'm running out of things to say because of your amazingness. 


Edit 3: A bigger version, sorry for the delay!

TLDR: My giftie's mom turned over his/her gift to the police.





&gt;Okay, here's what happened: I completely forgot about this re-gift thing. So much so that when I find a big box from Georgia on my front step, I had no idea where it came from.
I found it on the way out of the house. I was going to an appointment today so I got in the car with my mom (can't drive yet) and opened it up. First thing I took out was the Walking Dead. Whoa, sweet! Still have no idea where this came from but...okay, then I take out the gun. I can tell it's a toy, but my mother starts freaking out. ""WHAT IS THAT DID THEY SEND YOU A GUN OH NO OH MY GOD"" I tell her to relax, and pull out the next thing, a heavy unidentified...metal thing? Keep in mind that I had no idea where this came from. So seeing a big heavy unidentified metal thing in thick bubble wrap made me a bit nervous. My insanely paranoid mother, of course, starts flipping her shit. I don't know what to tell her (still too occupied with the surprise of getting a huge box to ponder over where it came from) so I say ""Alright, relax! We can tell the police, just to be safe! I'm sure it's nothing."" 
I don't know what the hell it is, so I figure we can just stop by the station and have them open it. Just a few minutes, no big deal. Better than opening it in the car.
We were going right by the fire station anyway, so we pull in and tell them. I tell mom to stop blabbering and say ""Look, I just got a package from Georgia, I don't know anyone in Georgia, it's pretty heavy, could you take a look just to be safe. I'm sure it's nothing."" They empty the box and set aside the two bubble-wrapped things. We walk away a few meters from the car; the firemen are asking me ""Are you SURE you didn't order anything online?"" I think for a second. FUCK, FUCK, FUCK it's my reddit gift. FUCK.
So I spend ten minutes trying to convince the firemen that really, it's fine, it's just this secret-santa thing I signed up for, and I myself had sent a package to a stranger a couple months ago, and it's not a bomb, and we can just open it and be on our merry way. But no, we wait for them to send a local cop, who opens it and confirms that it's just a nerf gun and a bottle. My mother, who has been panicking and crying over no doubt dozens of imagined disaster scenarios, won't listen and still thinks someone is trying to murder me. 
They throw out both the gun and the bottle, just to be safe. I tried to fish out the deck of cards and stewie-ball, but they were already in the bottom of the barrel and covered in foam pellets so I couldn't find them. I'm trying to convince my mother and the firemen that really, honestly, it's just a gift and that you are being nice, really. One of the firemen starts telling me never to do this again, never to trust anyone on the internet, it's too much of a risk.
They leave everything in the garbage, even though the cop confirmed it was fine. But my mother just won't have it. The skull is too weird for her. There is no hope of fishing the football or cards out. I did manage to salvage the Walking Dead though. 
So we leave and I am finally able to convince my mother that the package was perfectly fine, after much yelling. I feel terrible that they threw away the gun, you obviously put lots of work into it. My mom is a fucking idiot.
I'm reading the Walking Dead, though, and I absolutely love it. You truly went above and beyond. I guess nobody can just be nice to strangers, ""in this post- 9/11 world.",,False,self,t5_2rc6h,True,,,True,t3_jlu0c,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/jlu0c/my_gifties_mom_turned_over_his_gift_to_the_police/,

In my opinion, this is an amazing feat, even though we still aren't sure what percentage of these people will follow through.


That being said, there are more people in need of a rematch.  I am not writing this to ask people to give more, that is entirely up to you.  I am writing this to let those people still shafted know that you probably will not be rematched.  If more people sign up to give more, I will still rematch, but I don't think it is very likely at this stage of the exchange.


Remember though, this is about the giving and there is no promise of rematch, but we do try.

After seeing some great responses, this is what I'm thinking right now.  We ask 10 questions, in addition we have our existing likes/dislikes field.  Of these 10 new questions, you are required to fill out 5 of them.

Unfortunately i don't have a good algorithm to detect when someone has answered a question well, but I think this will be a good start.  Here are the questions I'm thinking:

* What are your favorite colors?
* If you could travel somewhere right now, where would you go?

We've released some changes to prepare for the near future where we will be having more than one exchange running and accepting sign ups at the same time.  In order to do this we have added a new page for you to [manage your exchanges](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/manage/).  To get to this page you just click your exchanges link at the top of the page on redditgifts.  From this page you can see all the exchanges you're participating in and any upcoming exchanges (none yet).  You can also see how many **exchange credits** you have.  

WTF is an exchange credit you might ask?  It's pretty simple, when you sign up you get 1 credit.  When you enter your first exchange, that credit goes away and will return (plus one) when you complete that exchange.

To complete an exchange you must have satisfied all of these requirements:

1. retrieved your match
2. shipped your gift
3. had the gift you shipped received and posted to redditgifts **or** proven shipping via a receipt or something nice like that to an admin.
4. posted the gift you received **or** confirm that you didn't receive a gift.

Note, for those people who have been so generous to give a gift to the shafted for an exchange they didn't even participate in, they will get a credit for that as well.  **You can get at most 1 credit per exchange**

My fridge is full. Tomorrow is my birthday. I planned on getting a $25 steak. Directly north of my apartment is a very rough part of Houston. Houston is brimming with beggars. Every time I go North on Silber Rd. I pass by a homeless man with two dogs. Every time his sign is the same. ""Need dog food and something to eat."" I've told myself too many times one day I'd get something for him. Driving past him today I pulled my car into the Wal-Mart and picked up a giant sub sandwich, two gallons of water, chips, four cans of dog food, a bowl and some granola bars. It was $21. Parking my car and meeting him on the corner I said, ""These are for you."" And pulled out the cans of dog food and bowl. He shook my hand and said, ""My name is Joe"" as he started to cry. ""Good evening Sir, I'm Chris."" I handed him his sandwich and water and he said, laughing and crying, ""Oh shit, I'm gonna eat the hell out of that."" I shook his hand one last time and told him to have a good night. I'm not trying to seek glory, but rather to say that sometimes we need some perspective. I have a lot, probably too much, and I wanted to make Joe and his dogs' day better like I promised myself I would for months. Basically, do good things, because Joe really really god damn appreciates it.

As long as you aren't just buying some random crap without checking out your giftee, or aren't trolling Secret Santa by sending paper clips or some shit, you're going to be fine, and even if your giftee is not blown away by your gift giving brilliance, they're still going to be grateful and graceful. 

So, stop stressing it, really, and have fun with it! Merry Holiday of Your Choice to all of you in advance.",,False,self,t5_2rc6h,False,,,True,t3_e3j67,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/e3j67/yes_your_gift_idea_is_fine_seriously/,

Last year secret santa was big.  We were on TV in Canada, were all over the press, we reached to nearly 4500 people in 54 countries ... it was amazing.

This year, in 36 hours we have passed 10,000 sign ups in 75 countries! Seriously!  Check out the [statistics](http://redditgifts.com/statistics/) page, you can see other redditors on the map around the world!

Here in the north pole (actually a small house in Alameda, CA) we are really sick.  We have fevers, bad coughs, etc. etc. ... we blame it on being in DC last week[.](http://i.imgur.com/avo3I.jpg)  So it might take us a bit longer than normal to get back to your emails ... bare with us.

Here are the issues we know about and are dealing with right now:

1. We only have one server that we run redditgifts on.  We had a ton of traffic yesterday and the majority of it was not passive read traffic, it was people signing up (writes to the database and api calls).  So, no matter how efficient I write the code, there are only so many processes one machine can handle.  We just have to deal with this, we dont make any money on redditgifts and getting more servers really just isnt an option.  Sorry.

2. Emails - We send a lot of emails ... like a ton! Since yesterday we have sent more than 21,000 emails.  This means that we get flagged in some systems.  So, **check your spam folders**.  Also, comcast won't even receive our emails.  Do you work for comcast? please fix that!

3. Verification - Since yesterday we have had over 7400 people sign up on redditgifts as new users.  For each one of these, we have to make an api call to reddit to verify that they have posted their code.  Each of these calls seems to take anywhere from .5 seconds to 30 seconds.  The way the code is written we can only have one process doing this at a time ... so what usually takes less than 30 minutes is now taking a long time.

**plugs**

This year i'll be plugging this stuff from time to time.

**donations** - We're hoping that some of you will say thanks for the hard work, or something, and help our local schools [here](http://redditgifts.com/donate/).  We could really use the help.


**coupons** - We have set up a few [coupons](http://redditgifts.com/merch/) for you guys this season, so keep them in mind if you want to use one of these fine retailers for your gifts.",,False,self,t5_2rc6h,False,,elfhat,True,t3_e0voy,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/e0voy/first_36_hours_recap_weve_broken_10000/,

I was a bit disappointed, but hopeful that it was actually a prelude to a real gift. 

My Secret Santa contacted me a few days later and told me that he was eager to send the 2nd part of my gift, and that I might get it shortly. On January 11th, the door-lady at my apartment told me she turned away a package addressed to my apartment number since it was addressed to [my SS's name] and not to me. I was excited to hear that I was actually getting a gift, but it was sitting at the local UPS warehouse. I drove to the warehouse to try and pick it up, but they wouldn't let me - again, because it was addressed to [my SS's name] instead of to me. After a few days of going back and forth, calling UPS as myself, and as [my SS's name] they finally agreed to attempt delivery of the package once more, but this time I should be down in the apartment's lobby waiting for the delivery truck, in case there was any confusion. After a long wait, I finally got the package in my hands and tore it open on the elevator (I was too excited to wait until I got to my room!)

[Here is what I found](http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/office-depot-mailing-list-subscription/)

It seems that, in addition to the paperclips, my Secret Santa also signed me up for the Office Depot mailing-list, which includes a large catalog shipped to my door and a weekly advertisement mailer!

I tried to call Office Depot to remove myself from this mailing list, but they said that it would be impossible, unless I was calling from the phone number used to order the initial package.

So thanks Santa! Now I will never forget this gift-exchange, since I will be getting junk mail for years to remind me! ",,False,self,t5_2rc6h,False,,,True,t3_f5bzf,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/f5bzf/possibly_the_most_anticlimactic_moment_in_this/,

This year we decided to open up signups earlier than ever and we also decided to promote more than before.  I think these were good decisions to make for a number of reasons, but they are causing some side effects that I didn't anticipate.  Namely, I think they are making people impatient (especially old-timers) and I think people might be losing sight a bit of why we are here and why we are doing this.

**For the old-timers**

Remember last year when this whole thing happened? It all happened in a few weeks, we all put a lot of work into it and then redditgifts was born.  When redditgifts was born, there was a flood of activity in this subreddit and across reddit, people were astounded at how many redditors lived right next to them, people asking many, many questions about how shit is going to work, and the answers were few and far between because we didn't know yet, but we figured it all out together.

Well, this year there are WAY more new-timers than old timers and they are fucking excited, just like we were.  Most of them didn't even know this thing existed and that is great!  As old-timers we should help them out.  They ask questions before looking for answers (we all do that), they make repetitive posts ... basically they just found out that santa claus exists and it is blowing their mind, just like it probably blew your mind when you were 4 years old or whatever.

**let them be excited, let them post, let them have their christmas eve**

This is important, very important.  The more excited people are they more they will remember to participate and that is what we need.

**For the new-timers**

Welcome to our community, I am really fucking stoked that you are here, and I want more of you here!  Here we are nice, we do nice things for each other, but we're human and sometimes we get pissy.  Forgive us.  Here are some links for you to get you up to speed a bit:

If you want to see how many people are participating, where they live and stuff like that, check out [the statistics page](http://redditgifts.com/statistics/).

If you have a question, first check out our [faqs](http://redditgifts.com/faq/), if your answer isn't there, maybe you could add it there after you figure out the answer!

We have a lot of gifts to look through to give you ideas of cool stuff in [the gallery](http://redditgifts.com/gallery/).  Also, we give awards for cool gifts [over here](http://redditgifts.com/gallery/awards/).  Check those out, they are super rad.

One last thing to note, please post to the subreddit.  We have a lot of passionate people that hang out in the subreddit who will answer your questions.

1258000440.0,196,self.secretsanta,a3i0s,"SecretSanta - Start here for whats next, schedule, rules, guidelines and suggestions",kickme444,219,23,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/a3i0s/secretsanta_start_here_for_whats_next_schedule/,"** The Basics **

The idea for the reddit secret santa program came up on november 10th and a lot of redditors have shown interest.  I have read just about every comment and put as much thought into all of them as humanly possible and come to some decisions for how this is going to run.  Here is what is going to happen, if anyone is asking how to sign up, or what to do, please direct them to this post.

* **Step 1.** If all goes according to plan, on November 17th, I will release a website that you can use to sign up.  When you sign up you will be asked to post a code inside a reddit comment which a program will check for to verify that you meet the secretsanta requirements (see below).  Assuming you are verified, continue to step 2.

* **Step 2** On December 1st you will receive an email indicating who you need to send a super-fucking-awesome package to.  The email will contain: reddit username, address, shipping instructions and special comments.

* **Step 3** You will have 10 days to ship your item.  PLEASE ship by the 10th and before if at all possible.  The hope is that everybody will get their packages by December 24th.

* **Step 4** Go back to the website and mark that you have shipped your item.

* **Step 5** Go back to the website and mark that you have received your item.

* **Step 6** Take pictures of your super awesome secretsanta gift whether you like it or not and post them (we'll get instructions for this later).

**PLEASE REMEMBER** - I am doing this for two reasons and two reasons only: 1. I really love christmas. 2. I really love reddit.

 If people become dicks, I will really not want anything to do with this.  In the event this happens I will gladly surrender all work I have done on the project, but please ... don't ruin fucking christmas.
                      

**Rules, suggestions, guidelines**

* If you are not absolutely sure you will send a gift, PLEASE do not sign up!

* This is working on the honor system.  **Don't be an asshole, please!**  It will feel shitty to put effort into a nice gift and not getting anything in return.

* **User must have been a redditor prior to November 10th.**

* I hold no liability in any of this.  By signing up, you understand that you might put together a super-fucking-awesome gift and get jack shit, or something you hate in return.

* Deadline to signup and verify your information will be Dec. 1st at 2pm pacific standard time.

* Deadline to ship and verify you have shipped your item will be Dec. 10th.  If you have not verified, emails will go out and the inquisition will start!!!

* Your name will be posted in a thread if you did not ship your item.  If this happens, you should probably never show your ugly face on reddit again!  You will not be allowed to sign up next year.

* Suggested value of gift + shipping should be $15 (USD).  Handmade awesomeness is suggested, thought required!  If you choose to ship to a different country, increase the amount of money on your gift.  If you want to spend 2,000 on your gift, by all means.  But don't feel shafted when you get a handmade piece of felt bacon in return.

* Your gender will be shared if you choose to.

*  If you choose to only ship to your own country and the numbers do not work out, you will not be participating.  You will be notified as such.

* It is HIGHLY ENCOURAGED that after you receive your item, you post pictures to the subreddit or website gallery if we implement this.

* It will be up to the sender whether they choose to divulge their reddit identity.

* You will be able to provide shipping details if needed

* You will be able to provide some comments for the person gifting you.  These are not required, but if you have some food allergies or hate bacon, use this space.

* You will have the option to gift more than one person

* **Gifts Prohibited Are**
  * Food items
  * Nothing NSFW.  Seriously, I don't want to open a giant plastic dong in front of my small children.

First of all, Happy Holidays! It's officially Christmastime; as soon as the advent calendars are broken out, that's when you know it's truly Christmas! Especially when I'm sat writing up stupid essays and can see [all of this](http://i.imgur.com/SAkZk.jpg) outside my window! Man, when it snows in Scotland it *snows*. I haven't ventured outside since it started, it's sort of went a bit [like this](http://imgur.com/AxreO) any time I've considered venturing outside.

But anyway! Moving on!

There are just a few points I wanted to address as shipping day approaches.

1. If your Santa has not retrieved you in x amount of days, STOP WORRYING. A lot of Santa's don't re-retrieve until they plan to ship; this is so incredibly common so stop worrying about it. I know it's nerve-wracking but go off and focus on your own giftee.

2. If your Santa hasn't messaged you, STOP WORRYING. Messaging isn't obligatory. Most only send one if they have a question about something, if you don't get a message then it's not a big deal.

3. See the gift you got your giftee? *It's awesome*. So stop worrying that because people have got crusies and kindles and all sorts that your gift won't match up. Your giftee will love your gift because you put effort into thinking of something they would like; that's the whole point of it! So stop thinking they'll be disappointed or something because you know they really won't be. (Unless they're a douche, which is entirely possible but unlikely, we tend to be a friendly bunch)

4. If you've sent a message to your giftee and it wasn't through the anonymous option on the retrieval page then I'm sorry, but there's nothing we can do about it. 

5. Those of you who are desperate for a message from your Santa, please don't post asking to be messaged or post some comment somewhere that's sort of guilt-trippy or post a comment that makes you seem like you're pissed off that they haven't messaged you. Because that isn't fair to your Santa. They could be off buying and making the most wonderful thing and it wouldn't be fair to then make them feel bad about not sending a message when they didn't think they had to. Put yourself in their shoes!

6. DON'T under any circumstances, bad mouth your giftee in any way. This includes complaining about them being vague or complaining about them not posting yet. It's not cool to see someone saying you suck so just don't do it. About the posting thing, a lot of students are doing finals and end of term coursework and may not be at home. They could have used their parents address because that's where they'll be when they have the time to open the gift. Also I understand people who have work or kids or anything like that will also be busy, so please be considerate to any and every circumstance.

7. If you receive a gift, POST ABOUT IT. This is a requirement! If you don't post, you will get banned. You need to mark it as not received if you didn't get a gift otherwise we can't deal with your bad santa! So bottom line is, if you get a gift then at the very least you should be sending a quick message to say you did get it if you don't have the time for a big detailed post at that time.

8. If you can, please keep some kind of receipt for shipping. You never know what can go wrong with shipping, so just in case it would be handy to have some kind of confirmation. If your shipping method isn't online or doesn't include tracking or something, just remember to ask for a receipt. This makes it easier for the team to keep your account alive and kicking if your package gets all late and muddled somewhere or if your giftee says they never got it. 

Wow, this is a looooong message! But I do feel it's necessary to point these things out to you guys just to keep everything happy and fun and as stressless as it can possibly be! I mean, Christmas time is stressful enough so lets ease it up on each other.

Other than that, you guys are giving some pretty damn awesome gifts! I can't wait to see what else you've all shipped off to each other!

[As you can see](http://imgur.com/Muj0g.jpg) Chef tofu (the cat) is obviously more excited about the box than the treats. For the trolling my present was boxed within a box, and on the inner box was a letter taped to it. This letter posed my SS as a 40 year old mother of 3 and devout christian who took the opportunity of the gift exchange to spread the word. My SS did their research and knew that I was a liberal college student who didn't believe. Disheartened I still opened the box and found all my goodies, another letter, and a large image of the troll face.

Thanks SS

It was a nice time, we had grilled cheese sandwiches with ""gourmet"" cheese and tomato soup.  Throughout the lunch we were speaking about the whole secret santa project and some of the technical hurdles I had faced and was currently facing. One of the hurdles has been scale.

When I got back home from lunch I had a nice email from the reddit team offering to pay for a new server for redditgifts.com.  I quickly jumped at the offer.  Less than a week later and with a lot of help from friends, we are now serving redditgifts.com from a new server with room to grow.

A big round of applause to the reddit guys!

The specs of the server are as follows.  This is hosted by amazon ec2 and is currently a ""large"" instance.  This means that should we need to, we can add new servers very quickly to spread the load.

No worries, I didn't actually fall over but I am totally blown away by [fieldexpedient2's](http://www.reddit.com/user/fieldexpedient2) awesomeness, read on and you'll see. 

FIRST of all, pens glorious pens!! His [note](http://i.imgur.com/sDSOM.jpg) got me giggling and I dove right in to his ""five year collection of vendor pens"". He wasn't kidding, it was quite a collection. I didn't want to rush unpacking the gift so I took out the pens in handfuls and laid them out. 

There were [two water bottles and a notebook on top of the pens](http://i.imgur.com/17aDM.jpg) and as I pulled out the pens I discovered many useful items; [sets of highlighters](http://i.imgur.com/bferb.jpg), magnets (how do they work?), mini notebooks, gum, a flash drive, chapstick, a tiny hp mouse (my mouse died out on me a few months ago and haven't gotten around to replacing it, now I don't have to, works great!), mini sharpies, [a witch ring](http://i.imgur.com/AazS0.jpg)  (wearing it right now! haha) mints and a small black box. Now, I was already giddy about the pens, such a massive collection, I couldn't wait to sort them out, take pictures, post them on redditgifts then go off with a notebook and test out the pens. 

As I took the little box out, I didn't really look, I set it off to the side with the non pen items as I was intent on getting the pens out. I looked at it again as I started another row of pens and saw SONY written on it.. I grabbed it, looked at it.. wondered what is it? a phone? flipped it to the back, ""Mobile HD Snap Camera"". Oh. Em. Gee. I put it back down, not wanting to get my hopes up (long story short, my siblings and I.. we always try to trick eachother by putting gifts in boxes of other things.. like shoes in a toaster box or candy in a jewelry box, etc) and proceeded to take out the rest of the pens and sort them out as I glanced furtively over at the box thinking NO. WAY... 

I finally finished unpacking the box, took some pictures and then grabbed the box, sat down and photographed the [unboxing](http://i.imgur.com/iahvC.jpg). It really was a [SONY Bloggie Touch](http://i.imgur.com/gZxKY.jpg)! Woah! It is beautiful! No need for an SD card, built in 4gb memory, and very easy to use. I didn't know such a thing existed, a camcorder this small? (I'm a bit behind on the advanced gizmos, this is my very first 'touch' piece of equipment, woohoo :) 


So to continue my too long story, I had taken so long unpacking the box that by this time I was running late so I headed out with the Bloggie (did you know it comes fully charged?) and when I got back home I had way too much fun going through the pens with my sisters. There were a ton of interesting ones in there, some light up, others have highlighters on the ends or come with built in sticky post-it dispenser, cool logos, etc. All I know is I am set for life on pens! And as for the [Bloggie](http://i.imgur.com/MuJo5.jpg), well, I don't think I mentioned in any of my comments that I lost my point and shoot in January :( and I am putting my DSLR up for sale due to an unexpectedly long term of unemployment and very untimely medical bills. So this is... just perfect and so incredibly generous, [I can't thank you enough!](http://i.imgur.com/1J6e5.jpg)

Being an avid thrifter and frugal college student I knew the perfect place to buy a truly one of a kind and special gift: the local thrift store! Then I got to thinking, wouldn't that be the perfect gift exchange? Thousands of redditors from all over the country, or even the world, heading out to their local thrift stores and picking up some of the craziest, strangest gifts that you would never be able to find in stores. And what's more, this exchange stems from stores designed to be save money, so no one will end up spending tons of money.

In light of these posts I feel that my gift will be somewhat disappointing. I don't earn a great deal of money, my gift will almost certainly be very cheap (though I will put as much thought into it as possible).

I signed up because giving gifts is awesome, and to brighten some anon's day, even in a small way, is exciting.

Basically I just hope you're not expecting anything too extravagant if I'm your secret santa.


EDIT 1: Most of you are saying the same thing in your replies, so forgive me for not addressing each personally.

The standard response seems to be that any gift with a little thought is appreciated. That's exactly how I hoped most people would see it, certainly how I see it myself.

I'm sure the vast majority of you would be happy to recieve any gift, no matter how big or small, from a fellow Redditor. This has given me confidence that whatever gift I choose will be appreciated.

Thanks for the replies.

EDIT 2: Wow! I didn't expect the amount of upvotes this has received.

It's comforting to know that the majority of people have signed up with the right intention - to give a gift rather than receive one.

I'm really looking forward to finding out who my giftee is now, and I've got you guys to thank for restoring that feeling.

With today being the official start of signups for the 2012 Secret Santa, I'm seeing a lot of posts like these:

""""This is why I am not wanting to sign up. I've gotten shafted too many times in the gift exchanges to want to do a non PLUS version of this. Hell, even when I DO sign up for the PLUS, I STILL get shafted! Hell, I even got shafted on the damn TIE exchange. I didn't even get rematched on that one.""

""Yes, I put a ton of thought into my gift. Spent around $75 USD only to be stiffed by my secret santa. What do we say to r/secretsanta when they ask us to participate? Not today, not this year.""

These make me really sad, but they also make me think.  Are we focusing so much on the Guinness record, that we're having a lot of unmotivated, flaky people sign up without following through?  Is all the hype around the record causing someone to join because they want to get a certificate from Guinness but forget (or don't care) in a week?

I think the record has caused the admins to focus on quantity over quality, which is leading to a much shittier experience for lots of people who take the time to stalk their giftee and ship gifts.

EDIT: According to the mod '5days' below, the reason for not having a Plus exchange is bandwidth-related.  They just don't have the manpower, which is completely understandable.  It's okay to only have one exchange if we can improve the quality of that exchange.

I am a 22-year-old mother of an 18 month old, and am 36 weeks pregnant with my second child. My fiancé barely make it living paycheck to paycheck. He works as a car salesman making only $18,000 a year base salary, and anything else is based on commission. I was working full-time until I got laid off in October. I tried to find another job, but despite it being illegal to discriminate against pregnant woman when hiring people, no one is willing to hire me because I will have to take time off when the baby comes. Therefore, everything has been an enormous struggle for us since then, and getting ready for the baby to come has been basically impossible.  

I was only introduced to reddit about 6 months ago, and have been a member for only 4 months. Like most of you, reddit has quickly become my “go-to” site, and I have enjoyed becoming part of this amazing community. This was my first year participating in the redditgifts Secret Santa Exchange, and I my experience has been nothing short of amazing. 

My Secret Santa sent me the first part of my gift a few weeks ago. I was surprised to receive two items from my baby registry, because I had never mentioned my baby registry on reddit or on reddit gifts. My secret Santa must be an amazing reddit stalker, I thought. Then he informed me that this gift was only part 1, and that the 2nd part would be arriving on December 14.  

Well on December 14th, we came home to a HUGE box at our door. Upon opening it, I first saw this letter from my secret Santa:


Season’s Greetings jesspest,

This is the third redditgifts Gift Exchange in a row in which I have participated.
Ordinarily, when coming up with ideas for gifts, I use my giftees’ reddit histories to find good gift ideas for them. In real-life, I am known for being attentive to people when it comes to gift giving. And I, for the very most part, end up giving people what they really like.
However, when I found that you were my match, the ‘Gift Exchange’ took on a whole new meaning. Redditgifts, in some strange way, knew about how generous I am during the holidays because as I read your reddit history, I realized that you are in a position in which you really need things. And in thinking about what to get you, I also realized that there are people in your family who could need and use a lot of things as well. Therefore, I quickly snapped into action.
Now, I am hardly well versed in knowing what to give very young children, let alone new families. But I am sure that you and yours (including yours on the way) will be delighted with what I have chosen as gifts. 
And as for you, given what little information I gleaned from you yourself, I can imagine what kind of parent you have become. One who would do everything for her kids, and one who would pay little attention to what she herself needs and wants. This was what really put me in a bind because normally, as I said, I am pretty good at figuring out what my giftees would like. But in your case, I thought to myself, “If this woman leaves me absolutely no clue as to what I should give her as a gift, she must be an amazing mother.” So, having made this assumption, which I have absolutely no doubt is true, I feel that I should reward an amazing mother accordingly. 
As you and I both know, reddit, as an entity, is based on karma. And when I read your reddit history, I also realized that you and your new family could use all the good karma you can get, especially at this time of year. I charge you to take all of this good karma that you received when you opened this package (and the “package” before this one), and do good for others around you. The smallest of things that anyone does for his or her fellow man is what makes this world go ‘round.
And with this, I wish you and you’re the very best this holiday season.


I was very touched by the letter, and it was amazing getting to watch my son open all the gifts that our secret Santa sent him.  Our secret Santa also sent lots of clothes and toys, addressed specifically to Scarlet Jean Louise, our baby girl who isn’t even born yet. Guess he really is an amazing stalker to have known her name, lol. He also sent a few items for everyone in the family. And then there was only one gift left in the box, which was labeled for myself. It said, “For when your kids are napping or you get a few spare quiet moments to yourself.” I opened it to find a KINDLE! And an Amazon gift card! 

I just want to say thank you to my Secret Santa, Cdtco. Your gift is by far the most heartfelt gift I have ever received from anyone. You far exceeded my expectations for Reddit Secret Santa, and I wish you the very best Holiday season!

Some of the info was a bit....off? The age and dates of stuff didn't add up. 
And the address was odd (no house or apartment number) but it was a country I wasn't familar with. I thought about his interests and sent something hoping for the best through Amazon.eu.

I got an e-mail yesterday that one of the gifts had been returned to Amazon as there was no such address. I had included the phone he gave on the amazon order so I wonder if that was fake too.

 I also had something else sent from a country he said he wanted to visit but I haven't heard if it was returned to the merchant yet.

",linds360,217,50,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/1431xc/to_anyone_thinking_about_copping_out_on_their/,"Yeah it's long. I'm not brief, but it's the story of a girl who grew up and dealt with humiliation. That shit hurts.

I'd actually forgotten this memory for a while because it happened when I was 15 (31 now,) but for some reason it came back to me today while I was sitting in Friday traffic on the way home from work, so I thought I'd share. Here goes...

I grew up being a huge Superman fan and ever since I can remember I always wanted to be the next Lois Lane. While I loved Superman, I didn't want him to save me, but I sure as hell wanted to write like Lois did. I loved writing about anything and everything. 

As a kid I would document my mom's moves in the kitchen minute by minute or report on which bird feeder was favored by our winged guests that day. I always had a pad of paper in hand and a pen tucked behind my ambitious ear. I was addicted to writing - news especially. It made sense to me. 

When my parents finally told me the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy were a lie, I wasn't surprised. Not because those ideas are far fetched, but because if it was *really* news, I'd had heard about it long before my parents made this report to a me. I just figured it was old news and certainly not worth reporting. Not on my memo pad at least. 

(Sorry, I may be providing too much background...moving on.)

Fast forward to high school. I grew up and never lost my Lois Lane ambition. I bounded into high school ready to write up a storm because this was the first time I would have an opportunity to write for a *real* paper. The High School had its own paper and I couldn't wait to run into the newsroom and write. 

Turns out only Sophomores were eligible to be in the Newspaper class, so I was turned away. However I was tenacious (read: annoying) and wouldn't take no for an answer, so the administration agreed to let me be a newspaper ""intern"" during that class period if I agreed to also do homework for an 8th period class that I was not part of but would be given all the notes for. That class was Health Education. I am happy to report that I have never had an STD or been pregnant, but I digress...

I said YES YES YES in so many ways. I remember jumping up and down because I was so damn happy. I told my mom when I got home from school that day that I had made it! 

I waltzed into that room during 8th period the next day thinking I'd be asked to write a BIG story. I had my pens and paper ready to go. 

Not one single person looked at me. Oh they looked, but turned away almost immediately. I was defeated, but not broken.

Days and weeks went by. I was able to sit in on editor meetings and watch the writers turn facts into stories, but nobody looked at me. Nobody wanted to see me. 

I was ok with that, until December came along and the whole staff was involved in a Secret Santa exchange. 

I thought this is my chance. This is how I will show everyone that I can give a good gift and maybe then, they'll know me. So I made my mom take me to Bath and Body Works. I worked at TCBY at the time so I didn't have a lot of money, but I really wanted to WOW the newspaper team, so i spent a week's worth of my paycheck and bought my giftee lotions and body scrubs and lip balm - the whole nine yards. I was so excited to have her open it. 

And she LOVED it. She really did and I was so happy.

Then came the other gifts.

One after another and not one of them had my name. Again and again people opened their gifts and a knot welled up in my stomach. 

OH MY GOD... they are not going to call my name. There wasn't going to be a gift for me...

My Secret Santa had skipped class that day... 

I wanted to run and hide. ""You can't hide under the desk, silly. Fake sick, Just FAKE SICK.""

 I had no idea what to do. 

When the Newspaper Adviser realized what had happened, he went to his briefcase and pulled out a tool set (no doubt meant for some other purpose) and gave it to me. 

I held out my hands and took it while holding back 9th grade tears. My teacher was the only person who gave me a gift. Why on earth did nobody in this class understand how hard I've been trying to become a part of them and now, here I am, taking a tool set from my teacher. Do they not see how hard this hurts? Have they never been here? Why does it have to be me?

Why does it hurt so much just to be me?

I guess there's a reason I blocked this out - it was the saddest gift I've ever received in my entire life.

So I end this story here. If you're a giftee please give your person something. If you don't have any money send them a card - it might mean the world to them. 

*EDIT:* I should note that I became the Editor and Chief of that school newspaper and made sure that no one ever was meant to feel the way I did. Freshmen and Sophomores were welcome to submit stories and feel a part of the experience.

It was a great paper up until I left and I left it in great hands. That Advisor became Principal of the school - no joke. He's a great guy. 

I'll provide proof if needed. Oh and I became an Art Director... if you care :)

I hope you're all getting prepared for shipping day! Currently, I'm writing essay 2 of 3 but I'm taking a break because to be honest, I never did like John Locke; we were never friends. Some of you may have heard of Hurricane Bawbag in Scotland just now, it [ripped our goddamn fence down](http://i.imgur.com/Gp3rb.jpg) but I've been sitting at the computer in my pyjamas eating apples all day so I'm fiiiiine.

Moving on!

A quick few points as shipping day approaches:

1. If you cannot ship by the 12th, *let your giftee know*. This is so important, I can't stress how much anxiety you'll be putting your giftee through by not telling them if you're shipping late.

2. When you receive a gift, *let your Santa know*. You can make a photo-less post in the gallery confirming that you received something and will update it later. Your Santa will receive an email from the site saying you received it and you can update the post when you have it in your hands.

3. Make sure you've checked all the customs regulations if you're shipping abroad; you don't want to get you or your giftee in trouble by sending something contraband. 

4. If you're sending food and haven't asked your giftee their allergies, *DO IT NOW*. You want them to be happy, not in a hospital bed!

5. Consider your giftee's living situation. If they have children or live with their parents and your gift is maybe a little NSFW, [do what this Santa did](http://i.imgur.com/ts7qc.jpg) and let your giftee know. I know I certainly wouldn't want to open a big box of dicks in front of my parents!

Okay, I think I've covered what I can for now. Any questions, as usual, you know where to find us.

Happy Holidays!

I hope everyone is excited and ready for when they get their match! I just wanted to post one final message to everyone before matches go out just so we're all clear on what's happening and just some favours I'd like to ask of you all in order to keep the subreddit all clear and productive!

First of all, this is how the day is going to go:

1. *Matching will be done randomly **later on today** so please don't make posts asking why matching hasn't happened yet!*

2. *You will be able to retrieve your match at around **9am Pacific Standard Time.** If you want to check what time it is there in relation to where you are, you can [click here](http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/usa/pacific-time/)*


Okay, got it? Good! So everyone who is posting desperate for the team to get going with the matching, it's still only about 6am over there at the time I'm writing this!! 

Secondly, I'm pretty sure the entire team is going to be manning the Secret Santa fort later today so that we can deal with questions or concerns or problems that may arise. (And with nearly 40,000 participants, problems are pretty much guaranteed!) So if you have any of these, please get in contact with us; ***problems with the site, questions about your account or how to work RedditGifts and general moans do not add to subreddit discussion so please do not post these on the subreddit.*** Also keep in mind that we all have real lives as much as you do and sometimes can't dedicate all our time to this. We are very dedicated though! I mean I'm currently hurrying to finish a 2500 word essay so I can give you all focussed attention later!

Also, if you see a post on the subreddit similar to something you were going to post (i.e being excited about match day, wanting matching to happen etc) then comment on that post instead of creating an entirely new post! It just helps keep the subreddit a bit tidier and then there's also able to be more discussion if people who would have made posts are commenting on earlier posts instead.

At this current time of writing, it is 2:22pm in the UK and about 6:22am PST, so European redditors: if you have any questions or concerns at this moment in time before matching happens later today then you can get in touch with me. 

**Important point!**
READ ALL THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU!!

We've had posts in the spam filter and also questions asked to us where the answers are very easily available and obvious as to where they are located. Like where to sign up; it's linked in the sidebar!! You should be reading the sidebar and going to the links relevant to you.

*Information about dates:* In the Secret Santa 2011 menu on RedditGifts, available by clicking on ""exchanges"" in the top right menu.

I want as many people as possible with questions or in need of tips to read the [RedditGifts Big Ass Guide Book](http://www.scribd.com/doc/69018698/The-Big-Ass-Guide-Book); it's there for a reason and can answer some general questions you may have. 


And finally, have fun and Happy Holidays!


*edit*: One last point based on posts already created since this one. Celebrities are matched in with everyone else, there is no preferential treatment for them.

Part of doing secret santa is the happiness that the gift giver receives by seeing their gift in the gallery ... I failed on this front.  But all is not lost... this year I am given a chance at redemption.  This year I must publicly explain myself, repent my past bah humbug-ness, or be labeled a scrooge forever with only a bag of coal and a bruising letter of shame.

Here are my instructions:

**1) Have a picture of the gift you received.**

I got what I deserved:  http://i.imgur.com/Of0oD.jpg

**2) Have the text of this message**
*""There is a package on the way to you.

You are to look at the gift and read the message on the packing slip. 

You are going think about what the message says. If you are unclear what it means, you will reply to this note. 

You can either report it as a received gift and slink off into the night.. or you can do things my way for greater reward. 

In that case, DO NOT post to the gallery yet, rather you will make a post over in r/SecretSanta that is in regards to the message on the packing slip. 

The post will: 
1) Have a picture of the gift you received. 
2) Have the text of this message and
3) post the text (in full!) of message on the packing slip. 
4) Have an explanation from yourself and a bit about why you do certain things in certain ways. 

You'll know what I mean when you read the message. 

All 4 elements of the post must be met. You will have exactly 48 hours from the time stamp of when the package is delivered to do this. If you do not post, you will receive nothing else. How you post &amp; what you say will also determine what, if anything, you get after this. Like I said, it's completely up to you. 
""*

**3) post the text (in full!) of message on the packing slip.** 
The packing slip said: ""A gift note from T.B.
Andy, you do not understand that the joy of Reddit SS is getting to see your giftee post in the gallery.  You Sir are being a GRINCH by only stating exctly what you got without enthusiasm, thanks, or even a picture.  BAH, HUMBUG!""

**4) Have an explanation from yourself and a bit about why you do certain things in certain ways.**
Now is my turn for a TOSH.0 web redemption.  I agree.  I have not fulfilled the reciprocal nature of SS.  I would first like to explain that I have been very active in my part of the SS of gift giving.  I have signed up for the international shipping option, I have sent a 3 pound box to New Zealand at considerable cost, and gotten thoughtful gifts every year.  Last year I convinced my wife to do SS, she got stiffed and got no gift.  So I bought her a gift and mailed it to our house so that she would not loose faith in Reddit.  (She still does not know)  So I have been an active and faithful participant for 3 years of gift giving.  But I have failed in gift receiving.  

Until pointed out by this years Reddit SS, I did not realize the full significance of the gift gallery.  I am not an ungrateful person and I thought I had been doing my full SS duties.  I did not realize that it was anything more than a place to identify that you have received a gift.  In this way I failed being a full participant in SS.  It was not a lack of enthusiasm but I do understand that I made the other people's SS less fun and fulfilling.  I am sorry.  Thank you for allowing my Grinch Redemption.  To Happier Holiday's ahead...

Now a video representation of how I made the other SS people feel:

I know it began a couple of days ago really but I haven't had the time to post something so for the purposes of this message, lets pretend it's the 1st of November! :P You may have noticed my slight absence recently - I had a couple of essays due and I had to hand stitch my Princess Leia costume for Halloween!


So as the insanity of SS11 begins to unfold, I just wanted to put a wee message out there to all you lovely people. 


First of all, welcome newcomers! And I know there are a looooot of you out there considering we've reached over 25,000 participants! Holy Batman that's a lot of friendly people in the world!! You newcomers may not know the ropes of RedditGifts yet so a wee while ago I created The RedditGifts Big Ass Guide Book; it has a whole bunch of tips on how exchanges work, buying gifts and shipping so check it out! It's linked in the sidebar of the subreddit! I hope you have a really good first exchange, this is honestly the friendliest bunch of people in the world so take full advantage of this amazing experience you're about to be part of!!


Secondly, to all the veterans out there! You all know the drill and stuff so I don't need to direct you to any guides or welcome you to the experience. However I will say that some of you vets get worried about shafting or being matched with a newbie or something like that so don't worry this time! You all know how wonderful these exchanges are and that no matter what happens, it's normally a pretty damn good experience! But anyway, have a really awesome exchange and I can't wait to see what you guys send out and receive!


I'd like to just sort out some things I think are important to the community in terms of asking questions and will help me and the other mods to answer you as quickly as possible. 


If you have a question related to...

1) *Your RedditGifts account:* please contact the team through the website on the ""contact us"" link at the bottom of the page. If you feel you aren't receiving attention fast enough, then you can mail us through the ""message the moderators"" link on the subreddit.


2) *Posts caught in the spam filter* : ""message the moderators"" tab and we'll sort it out.


3) *Quick questions about exchanges*: Check the RedditGifts Big Ass Guide Book and if your answer isn't there, message me! I'm more than likely to reply quickly to you if you have a wee question. 


If you wanna post something for the community to discuss, that's totally fine! But it can be a bit difficult to navigate the subreddit if people are posting questions they could direct elsewhere!


Lastly, please keep this a positive and happy experience! It happens every exchange where around shipping day or the weeks after shipping day, lots of people seem to get really down and want to share that with everyone else. Please try not to post too much negativity leading up to shipping day and the weeks after! I've said before, if you want to vent or just want someone to give you some ideas as to why you're in your current situation, I am here for you! Just send me a message and I will try to turn your wee frown upside down C:


Right, have fun everyone! I can't wait to see what you all send out!! :D

I've not had much luck unfortunately but whatever, it's been fun!

I do want to warn everyone about this scam, though: people asking you to mark your gift as received even when you haven't received your gift.

This happened to me in my second exchange. Several days after the deadline for shipping I got a message from my Santa telling me that he had sent my gift but that he had lost his tracking information. He asked me if I would mark my gift as received b/c he was worried he might get banned or whatever if I didn't do so right away. I trusted him so I marked the gift as received. Guess what? I never received a gift.

Flash forward to today. My Santa for this exchange sent me a long sob-story about how his car broke down so he had to spend a bunch of money to get it fixed. He has my gift, he swears, but he can't afford to ship it until next Friday. In the meantime he'd like me to mark the gift as received. This time around I responded with a polite message stating that I will gladly mark it as received but only when I receive it. 

For all I know my Santa this time is telling the truth. If so, I feel bad for not doing as he's asked. But having been burned once before I think I'd be an idiot to be so trustworthy again.

I can't afford to sign up to be a rematcher, but I decided to do something else. 

I went out and bought a simple, practical gift, some gloves. I wrapped them up and included a note saying, ""I don't know you, and you don't know me, but I want you to know this: You are amazing. Happiness is all that matters, so never waste your time on things and people you hate, live your life for the happiness of yourself and those you love. Smile, every day."" There is a girl living on my street who would stand at my bus stop every morning with me who I'm fairly certain goes to the same school as me, but we've never spoken or interacted. I noticed each morning that even though we stand beside a very busy street in a very rainy town, she didn't wear gloves and pulled her sleeves up over her hands. I gave her the present. 

That was all. She smiled, thanked me, introduced herself and then the bus arrived. We continued on with our day. Then about half an hour ago someone knocked on my front door. It was the girl. She handed me a gift bag and a card and told me her number was in it and that maybe we could talk and hang out. Inside was a very adorable stuffed reindeer. I was so flustered it was hard for me to explain to my brother who she was. That was so unexpected and makes me feel absolutely amazing inside that she thought so much of the small present I was able to give her that she'd give something back. 

I hope everyone else is getting just as much out of this exchange as I have. I have very bad social anxiety so even talking to the girl was incredibly hard for me for the few seconds it lasted, and I'm so very glad I did.

1. **IT IS ABOUT THE GIVING.**
2. You should be ok with not receiving a gift.  Complaining about not receiving a gift is **not** ok.
3. Receiving a gift is just a nice side effect of it being **about the giving**.   We do everything we can to remind people to send gifts, to remind people to post the gifts they received in order to maximize the amount of people who receive a gift.

It's printed on canvas and it's pretty damned awesome but I really don't think it was meant for me, I was not signed up for any exchanges that warrant this style present. 

So, if you can prove to me that you are the santa for this gift (provide my address, the address it came from or any details not listed here) then I will do everything I can to help you get this to the right giftee.

However, after some obvious googling and stalking he discovered my two passions: acting and cooking.

[This was his gift](http://imgur.com/B1GG8.jpg).

 A hollywood star with my name in it, a set of perfect Henkel knives, and $20 in case I didn't like either of those things.

I am using that $20 to make a donation in his name to the Atlanta Food Bank, so 2 more families will have food on their tables for Christmas.

The letter that came with it was a fucking trip. He's apparently in the medical profession, and due to him concentrating more on gifting rather than mending the sick, scores of people died. However, he has now armed me, so the body count may yet rise.

His letter finished with that 'his bitches call him Andy'. Well, I am proud to call him Andy.

[update] for folks offended by my use of the word 'vagina', I guess is I was being a dick. Of course, now all the dick in the world are offended as well. Oh bother.

Hey guys,

So I'm a reporter at CBC and get to funnel great stories from here into a different medium, and demographic.

I told them about the Secret Santa and they want to make a story about it for tomorrow.

Here's the catch:

They need to speak with a Montrealer for the story. Everything has to be viewed from a local perspective first. And the interview would take place tomorrow on CBC Radio One (cbc.ca/montreal; listen live!), during the morning show.

Send me a message if you are a Montrealer who took part.

EDIT: Thanks everybody! So far I'm in contact with 4 different people and this is going to be a great story to air on Christmas Eve. I'm so glad we're able to share such an amazing story with our listeners.

You guys rock!

EDIT 2:

It looks like my producers has booked two people already.

It will air during the morning show tomorrow between 6-830am. I'll try and get a more precise time later today.

Thanks for you help guys. It would of been nice to have as many people as possible on, especially kickme444 and 5days.

You can listen live [here](http://www.cbc.ca/listen/streams/r1_montreal.html), but I will also try and get a clip of the segment.

Merry Christmas!

I had a brilliant time participating in my first Secret Santa this year - really my first secret santa ever since i am a joyless little jew and we dont get to have friends or fun. 

but reddit brought me both. i sent a really special gift that i was so excited about and was only a little disappointed when i didn't receive a package. i have more fun giving usually anyway (dont get me wrong i love presents.) even though reddit told me i was rematched, i had forgotten about the whole thing. 

then today, just as i was commenting on a particularly beautiful cock with a narwhal drawn on it, i noticed something..
special...
something colorful..

about the top of my screen. and there it was. all little and orangered. someone, somehow, had written a private reddit message... to me!! 
little lurkery me!? PUNCTUATION!!!!!

my SS rematch wrote me under the name tsukifan, saying hi and asking me to comment a bit more so they could know more about me. that was 13 days ago, so i hope its not too late to start commenting. but that wasnt the best part.
my Santa told me they ""loved my webpage"". strange, i thought, i don't really have a webpage. so when i rolled over and saw www.somethingsomething.com/aviv i thought... ah, poor santa, they found a different aviv. i clicked anyway.

and there, to the tinny tones of an instrumental .wav of alanis morrisette's ""ironic""... was my website. a website i made when i was 11 years old, with the help of my german nanny. i had forgotten all about that... i had forgotten those stupid happy times, that i was a kid once. i had a really hard childhood, and its easy to remember the bad things. but when i saw that website i made at 11, it reminded me that through all the shit, i kept a pretty retarded, plucky demeanor. i was 11 and i had a cat and i loved golden retreivers.

i just wanted to share that... i had too.

----------  

**PREAMBLE**: As per [the rules](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2011/rules/):  
&gt; 9- Rematching will occur based on the generosity of redditors. If people do not sign up to give, we can not provide a rematch. **Please do not ask to be rematched.**  

----------  
----------  

Now that shipping day has come and gone, people are really starting to wonder about rematching. Here's what you need to know:  

- **My Santa never pulled my information or they never shipped, where do I sign up to be a rematch recipient?**  
Nowhere. You don't need to do a thing, we already know.

- **My Santa claimed they sent something, but I've received nothing, what do I do?**  
Patience young grasshopper. Twenty-Five (25) days after your Santa marked the gift shipped, you'll be able to click on the ""no gift?"" link on the exchange status page. If it's been less than 25 days, please be patient.  

- **Do I need to sign up to be a rematch Santa to be put in the rematch giftee pool?**  
No, you only need to sign up to give if you *want* to give again. Your entry into the giftee pool is automatic.

- **How will I know if I've been rematched?**  
You'll see *two* giftboxes instead of one on the exchange status page.  

- **When will rematching happen?**  
Round 1 will be *about* a week after the shipping deadline.  
Round 2 will be *about* a week after round 1 and is done in waves.  
Round 3 will be *about* two weeks after round 2 completes (roughly late January).  

- **Rounds? What are the rounds?**  
Round 1 = People you were never retrieved.  
Round 2 = People whose information was retrieved, but not shipped to.  
Round 3 = People who had a gift shipped, but received nothing.  

- **I want to be a rematch Santa, how do I do that?**  
Head over to http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/secret-santa-2011/rematch/ and sign up.  

- **I signed up to be a rematch Santa, will I receive again, or only give?**  
You are signed up to give again only. You will not receive anything except thanks. 

- **How will I know if I'm a rematch Santa?**  
Much like on matching day, you'll get an email.

- **When do I need to ship by?**  
There is no hard rule on when you should ship by, but we strongly recommend you do it within a couple weeks.  

- **I signed up for more than one rematch, will they all be in the same round?**  
Potentially not. You may get some new giftees in the first round, and others in the second or third.

- **Can I still sign up to be a rematch Santa or change the number I'm willing to give after round 1 is done?**   
Absolutely!  

- **I see there are more people potentially needing rematching then there are people who signed up to be rematch Santas. What happens then?**  
We will try to rematch as many people as possible, if there are not enough rematch Santa volunteers, then unfortunately not every one will get rematched.  
*NOTE*: The number of ""rematch signups"" of the stats page is the total number of gifts people have signed up to give.

- **I'm still confused... Help?**

The change to matching so far is showing great results (more on this in a few weeks when we have more data) and today I've released our next change - **rating the gifts you've received**!

First I'll say that these ratings are not for public consumption.  The person who sent you a gift will never know what you've rated the gift they sent.  This is something that will help us identify bad participants and take possible action to disallow future participation.

From now on, when you post a gift you've received, there will be a section for you to rate the gift.  However, it would be *extremely* helpful to us if you would go through the old gifts you've received and rate them.  To make this easier, we've added a new message on old exchanges you've done that need ratings.  Please go to your [exchange management page](http://redditgifts.com/exchanges/manage/) and follow the links to rate your gifts!

Edit: I've removed the part about changing the matching process, there is no code in place that ratings will effect the matching process.",,False,self,t5_2rc6h,1366922818.0,,elfhat,True,t3_1d3ukm,http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/1d3ukm/next_round_of_efforts_to_improve_participation_we/,moderator

I think you may have given me your username somewhere in your gift, but I've looked through the book over and over and I can't find it. I just have to say that for one thing, I never thanked you for your gift -- It was a particularly crappy time of year for me when I did receive it, and while it was a beautiful gift and your painting and especially your book quickly became my most treasured possession I just never got to posting pictures or thanking you for it. I'm ashamed to say that even when things started picking up and even though your book has been sitting on my shelf for a long long time, I never got around to taking any pictures or trying to find you, though I'm pretty sure I did post something to the redditgifts website. A short description I'd meant to supplement with photos I never ended up taking.

Life has gone downhill since then. I'm in more of a rut than I was before. Tonight in particular something just brought on the most ridiculous onset of depression and I was just curled up in my bed crying, and without thinking I reached out for that largely untouched drawer where I kept your book and read through it and it just comforted me so much.

And boy I have absolutely no excuse for not thanking you, for not sharing the wonderful gift you made for me, and for letting you know how much you have inadvertently managed to help me through some of the worst times of my life this past year. I wish I could share pictures of your book right now but I don't have a means of doing so at the moment but I will fix this as soon as I can. Either way, I know this comes more than a year late, but my god if you're reading this somehow and you recognize this gift as yours, thank you. So very much. 

( If it helps this book came with two others, as well as a painting of a poem that you'd commentstalked as one of my favorites. Also some rocks. )

And please tell me who you are so I can jump on you immediately and apologize for taking so damn long to at least try to thank you for such a beautiful personal gift from you and your family.

We had [over 400 entries](http://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/172fy8/want_your_own_shitty_watercolour_be_creative_and/) and we think this was pretty fun!  As a reminder, we now have a **[marketplace](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/)** on redditgifts where we are putting together a great list of [merchants](http://redditgifts.com/merchants/) selling their amazing stuff.  One of these merchants is of course Shitty_Watercolour and you can **[purchase your own, custom shitty watercolour](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/custom-shitty-watercolour/1053/)** for between $30 and $40, depending on if you want a physical copy or not.  We hope you'll support the marketplace and Shitty Watercolour!

OK, on to the winners.

**The top voted idea was from /u/TwinkleTard and their idea was:**

&gt; 100 duck-sized horses fighting one horse-sized duck

**The 2nd most voted idea was from /u/barbedcatpenis and their idea was:**

&gt; Dogs playing poker except instead of dogs, it'll be icons of Reddit.

&gt; - Nicolas Cage
&gt; - Grumpy Cat
&gt; - Neil Degrasse Tyson
&gt; - Overly-Attached Girlfriend
&gt; - Neil Patrick Harris

&gt; Any of these could also be replaced with others such as (but not limited to) Bad Luck Brian, Bill Nye, the reddit alien, etc.

Maybe we'll get prints made of these and sell them on the marketplace because frankly, these are pretty amazing ideas!

Since graduating with my music education degree in May of 2009, things have not been great. Long story short, everything in my life fell apart. Ended up working a shit job, never had enough money to pay all the bills and live comfortably. Like many others my age I am scraping by with what I have.

About 4 months ago I noticed my rats Pipsqueak and Mama Delilah developing mammary tumors, common in female rats, at an alarming rate. I was literally living paycheck to paycheck trying to build up some sort of savings, and when I noticed that the tumors were continuing to grow I called a bunch of vets in the city to get an estimate on what the surgery would cost to have done.

The cheapest vet I found quoted me a price of $150 per rat plus an $80 consultation fee, which was money I simply did not have. I have since been saving up what I can, but I recently took on a new job in the video game career which pays significantly less than my last horrible job, but actually places me on a career path that may lead somewhere really good, and makes me considerably happier. So the finances got tighter, but still I saved.

I participated in the 2010 Arbitrary day and loved it. For Secret Santa I sent my giftee this year a gift of homemade beer, along with a few other things, just something small and nice that I thought he'd enjoy. I never, EVER, expected such a generous gift on my own doorstep.

My Secret Santa sent me a plethora of gifts for my rats and my kitty cat Alice, but the most powerful gift was hidden inside a Snak Shak chewable edible rat hideaway hut. It was $300 in cash so that I can have the surgery done on my rat Pipsqueak. Unfortunately, Mama Delilah passed away last week from the combined stress of the tumor and a sudden myco flare-up. 

This $300 is by far the most generous thing I have ever received and it more than covers the cost of Pipsqueak's consultation and surgery. I am planning on donating the remainder of the money to a local shelter called Austin Pets Alive! Which is a non-profit volunteer-run shelter which strives to make the city of Austin a no-kill city.

My Secret Santa has so far stayed anonymous, and if they choose to stay that way, I understand, but I'd like to say this:

The last year of my life has been, by far, one of the worst I can remember, and it was made worse by feeling so helpless in terms of making my rats better. I had all but lost all of my faith in humanity, but you renewed it. Every time I get frustrated by Reddit, by the political squabbling and petty disagreements, by the trolls and the misogynists, I have to stop and remind myself that there really are truly wonderful and generous people on this site, who are willing to do something as generous as to donate $300 in cash to a complete stranger so her pet rat can get surgery. My heart is truly filled with an overabundance of love and gratefulness right now, and I cannot thank you enough for helping my little monster, for giving me faith in people again, and for making this a truly memorable holiday.

Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. A hundred million thousand times thank you.

It seems what she most wants are donations to cover emergency medical costs (in the event they come up) for a new Service Dog. She and her partner already have the funds needed for the initial cost of getting the dog ($5000).

I work with Dog Rescue groups so I know all about emergency vet bills.

I will match every dollar you guys donate up to $1000 between now and New Years Day.

Here is the website with details: http://anamazingtail.synthasite.com/

And a link to the page where you can donate (Paypal link on the bottom) http://anamazingtail.synthasite.com/you-can-help.php

Like I said, they have the initial $5000. They just need emergency vet cost buffer.

Also, if she would still like a physical gift I am more than willing to send something.

Edit: Currently at $5449. I am working off that number as $0. Anything above that I will match up to $1000

Edit: For those that haven't looked through her website please take a look at this: http://anamazingtail.synthasite.com/a-bit-about-me.php

It explains fully why this is important and needed.

For those of you that have given or are giving....This is YOUR giftee! This shows the community support we have on Reddit and it rocks. I thank you for committing my full funds and I am sure nonpareilpearl thanks you for it. This is what the SS, to me, is all about.

I thought it would be good if we share some of our favorite sites for gifts. This can be crafts/diy, shopping, interesting stuff, etc. Anything that may help us find or make the best gifts we can. 

It's always easy to say ""Go to Etsy!"" but then you get there and it's like the biggest mall in the world without the ""You are here "" map. You can get lost in there. So lets get specific and share Etsy shops and other sites to get inspired! Post links to blogs that focus on cool stuff and things to make too! Those can be super helpful.

Here are a couple of things that I have found recently.

[Star Wars snowflake patterns](http://mattersofgrey.com/diy-star-wars-snowflakes/). I've printed the patterns and I'm going to start tonight. If my person doesn't like Star Wars, I'll have some awesome snowflakes for the office windows : )

[Nice looking soaps from Rocky Top Soap Shop](http://www.etsy.com/shop/RockyTopSoapShop). I'm very intrigued by these. I am too sensitive to try them myself but I know some people who love a good bar of soap.

The only way it will work is if it has a good-hearted, strong community behind it, like we have here in r/secretsanta.

So, here is [r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/).  The idea is simple and something that I think many of you people here can get behind.  When you have a few extra bucks and want to do something nice for a redditor who's hungry, you send them a pizza.  If you're starving and are lacking dough *(hehe)* you can request a pizza.

I go to check it out and in it my SS says he needs an email address to send me a gift card.   I'm like, great, ok, here comes spam.  Right, right?  

Wrong!  Absolutely and undoubtedly wrong.  

After a few hours I receive another email from [The Children's Place](http://www.childrensplace.com/) saying I have a $25 gift card to use.  I look at my email again and there's another message from my SS.   

I log in to redditgifts.com and check out the message.   Here it is in it's entirety:


&gt;From: your secret santa 2011 match to you

&gt;So as someone who is also going through the joys of divorce and single fatherhood I know what you are probably going through. I ended up with a restraining order and full custody of my son. Single fatherhood can be rough at times, but it is great. As part of your gift I wanted to send you a gift card to the children's place as I have found it to be a great place for cheap and nice kid's clothes. They are having a 25% off sale today through the 12th so please buy something nice for him. Next week I will be sending you something for you. Enjoy!


After reading this message I teared up big time - here at work - sitting at my desk.  Just amazed at the kindness my SS displayed and wow'ed by the crates of sliced onions somewhere in the corner over there behind my desk.  

This isn't a post trying to score karma points or kudos for being a single dad or any such nonsense.  This is a post meant to thank my anonymous Secret Santa here on Reddit.   While I've already thanked him on redditgifts, it's important for everyone out here browsing the reddit forums to know that this community is powerful, more powerful than what many people might think.  

Thank you again Secret Santa.  Thank you Reddit.  And thank you to an awesome community of kind, empathetic and generous people.

[Edit 1] Just a short edit to link to my post in 
[redditgifts](http://redditgifts.com/gallery/gift/my-secret-santa-my-little-son-and-crates/)

~~Also, just to clarify, I used to have 2 reddit accounts before closing one down.  The one that I deleted is listed in the link above.  Please note that the redditor who was so generous is well aware of that information.~~ 

[Edit 2]
Re-linked my old redditgift account to this one. 

And again, thank you!

[Edit 3]

Since I've received this gift my Secret Santa has informed me that the above was the 1st of a 2 part gift. The first part being for my son, the 2nd part for me. 

Now my Secret Santa is sending me clues from the Reddit username holliscallnumber. In each post he adds in a numerical clue (Hollis call numbers) that I would be privy to know due to my job. I've deciphered them with some help and then just a few days ago my Secret Santa sent me an alphabetical clue that I had to decipher using a cypher wheel. 

With that all in hand, I now have to go to a local establishment at a certain time and date to get my next clue. 

I'll keep this post updated as I learn more about the 2nd part of my Secret Santa gift!

However, there are a few things that really make me feel just forgetting about the whole thing:

1. My giftee is annoying as fuck. And I don't say this lightly; please don't get the idea that I'm just looking for an excuse to bail out because I'm too cheap to buy a gift. I was really into this whole thing. Anyway, I was a bit late in shipping my gift, so I created a throwaway to contact my giftee to inform him that I'm alive, not a troll, and most certainly sending him a gift.

2. He was a complete douche about it, and implied that he found the time to ship his gift to his giftee on time, so why didn't I? Uh. I sucked it up, apologized, made an effort to be-friend him.

3. Checked his comment history: he is annoying at best, misogynistic at worst.. and someone whom I feel is the kind of person I'd never get along with, had I met him in real life. Yeah, I know how judgemental I sound right now, I don't really know how to put my exact dislike in words. It's just that now the whole Secret Santa thing has lost it's joy for me because it isn't heartfelt.

4. Also: All his messages to me begin with 'Oh hai' or some variation, ends in 'lolwut', and when I asked what else I could send his way (something he could use for a trip he's taking soon, perhaps), he asked me for money. Or an iPhone (lolwut). Goddamn I don't know if I'm just having a crap day which is why I'm so irate, but just re-hashing this is irritating the fuck out of me.

Before I get abused by people who think I'm the one being douchey, let me clarify that I don't plan on bailing out on this; I'm sending a gift because I signed up to do so, it's still the right thing to do. I'm just really pissed now because I had imagined this scenario where I get a giftee that I can really relate to, get along with, and perhaps be a friend in real life.

Also, my SS has not checked my info since he retrieved it last 26 Nov. So yeah. I'm grumpy.  &gt;:(
