The fall of GosuBuilds.,NoseKnowsAll,196,14,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1eheys/the_rise_of_imbabuilds_the_fall_of_gosubuilds/,"I am no longer working on GosuBuilds for reasons that I have fully outlined in an [post in the starcraft subreddit here](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1ehep0/the_rise_of_imbabuilds_the_fall_of_gosubuilds/).

The TL;DR copied from the above link is:

I wrote almost all of the builds on GosuBuilds. Fed up with the owner of the site only wanting money and not contributing at all, I offered to buy the website. Couldn't afford (and was unreasonable to give) the ridiculous $1000 he asked for, so I left the website. My new website is [IMBAbuilds](http://imbabuilds.com), a build order site I will constantly update made exclusively for the community.

Thanks /r/AllThingsTerran for all the support and feedback you've given me throughout the year.  I've taken a lot of it into consideration and I've truly tried to make this site the best I can based on you guys' comments.  Sorry for those who have checked GosuBuilds recently and not seen any updates.  And sorry for not getting this up and running faster - I was moving home from college in the past week and things have been rather hectic.  

I'll answer any questions you might have either here, in the /r/starcraft post, or by email.

Thanks again for all your support,

The guide will be simple enough for players to not depend on a coach and do this. Like the physical workout program, the P90X is pretty much a workout routine over the source of 90 days to improve physical fitness. All people really gotta do is follow the P90X vods for about 2 hours a day for the next 90 days and they get some form of significant improvement. With that in mind, there is no such ""P90X"" program for sc2 players to improve over a set time. I have seen players play THOUSANDS of games and yet they dont really improve at a reasonable rate. With that said, the program i will make is designed for the middle tier players in mind (Like gold, plat, diamond area). Since i will be making each day's ""routine"" specific and noob friendly as possible, this can take me some time as i will have to beta test it with candidates willing to put effort to follow the thing to see the rate of improvement and things to change. I will annouce candidates later to test it while they can give me their feedbacks and suggestion what to improve on. This is a work that is compiled by coaches, Grandmaster players of all races, and several friends and teammates in order to create the best possible self training program (And the only one of its kind) for sc2.

I hope this will come in great success so everyone can feel better and stronger and more confident about their play ;)

All these god damn buildings to be building from. Marines, in my opinion the most versatile unit in the game, completely useless under my command. Medivacs flying to their death left and right. Spidey mines hilariously ineffective.

I only play 3v3 as Terran (Platinum), and every game I just want to apologize to my teammates. The enemy will have 12 BLs and I'll be struggling to figure out how to expand to a third and why my stupid mules are just standing right next to the mineral line.

I'll swarm you from 3 different angles with every Zerg unit in the tab, but damn me to bronze if I ever feel like I'm not being constricted in the feeble meatsack you call a race.  

So this is to you, Terran jerks: your race is really, really difficult and quite frankly feels like a scooter with one wheel, but some of you make it look like a purebred stallion from hell.

Edit: As in I only play Terran in 3v3 games, non seriously, and have less than 200 games as Terran. The MULE thing was hyperbole. Sometimes I miss, and I fix it immediately.

I know recently we have fallen on hard times. Our glorious leaders and progamers have fallen under a shadow and have become disillusioned, and our tournament standings are reduced everyday; the slurry of PvPs, ZvZs and PvZs is enough to send any Terran away in frustration. 

This problem, this shadow, also extends to our ladder games. TvZ has left us all mindboggled, frustrated, as our attempts to damage Zergs are met with no luck. TvP is not a much better story; our brave infantry melt before the terrible, terrible damage of the protoss deathball. But such is life! I am not hear to offer an answer, or condolences. No. I can not offer you that, brothers. All I can offer is advice.

AllThingsTerran has become a breeding ground for complaints, justified complaints, but we need to rise out of our misery! Rise out of our frustrations, and fight onwards. Fight the good fight. We are terrans! When we win, we know it is not because of an easy mechanic, or because we got lucky; we win when we outplay. We win when our hands leap across our keyboard, making broad, powerful strokes with our mouse, and we micro and macro our way to victory. And, my friends, you cannot deny that when that zerg or protoss type their gg's, no feeling is better. Yes, we could switch to Z or P and it would be easier; but winning would not be so sweet.

So yes, times are tough. But we are terran! We shall persevere, and win, and soon this shadow shall be lifted and a grand, glorious return of the terran shall soon be reinstated!

And that's it! If this gets love then I'll go back in and edit the list a little (I may have missed a video or two, please comment! And also I might organize them by matchup), but for now I think it serves its purpose! Hopefully this can help some people (myself included) out; we all know EG's Terran Lineup is not their best, and it's a little less videos than the other 2 races, but Hell, it's awesome that they're doing this. Big thanks to DeMu and ThorZaIN :D

I'll summarize what he says in the video:

It's 1-rax expand into 4-port banshee's. It's not very refined yet, but still chops the hell out of the 4/6 Queen styles, which 4 banshees kill in 2 volleys. If they open gasless but then grab them and start to produce muta's in retaliation you can make enough vikings to shut that down. It's vulnerable to early aggression because you have to cut marine production, but it's a great response against Zerg greed. The build is very supply intensive, it's a supply depot and a half per production cycle. Once you get 8 banshees, you 2 shot spores and it's GG. You also need to cut SCV's, so if your push fails (unlikely) you lose. 


The Build Order goes:

9 Supply
12 Rax
15 OC
16 Expand
17 Supply
18 Double Gas 
22 Bunker and 3rd Gas
@ 150/100 Factory

4 Starports -&gt; 4rth Gas
4 Techlab
4 Banshee's should come out around 8:35

An sample lecture would basically be this (But abit more professional)... **http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/15tlyo/how_to_get_better_vods_on_improving_your_play_as/**


This will be a weekly based (Saturdays 8pm EST) and will cover several topics anyone can learn. These lectures will be highlighted as a VOD on my twitch and soon to come youtube channel (ugh). This will go for about a month to see if its successful or not. If successful, we can keep going and if not, we stop the series. Most of these lectures will be similar to how i usually personal coaching to students. Please note: That because the audience have a wide range of skill level, the lectures will generally be based on higher level stuff so everyone can benefit for it (I think).

Each lecture will generally range somewhere between 1-2 hours depending on topic reviewed. There will be Q&amp;A as well. The stream will default abit lower bit rate so even people with lower download speeds can watch. If anyone misses it, there will be VODS.


With that said, the very first lecture ""Lesson #1"" will begin this **Saturday at 8pm EST**. Lesson 1 will talk about CC First in TvZ and TvP. As usual, i will explain possible transitions, all notes to remember, things to be aware of, pros/cons, and benchmark differences and such. I will see you soon for our first lecture ;)

Any questions please post below or message me. Thx!

1348032745.0,66,self.AllThingsTerran,104ge0,Blizzard I'm begging you : In HotS allow addons on either side of a building,Midnightblues,86,20,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/104ge0/blizzard_im_begging_you_in_hots_allow_addons_on/,"For the longest time the fact that addons can ONLY go on the right side of a building has been the biggest pain in the world. In a game I just played, I spawned in the lower left position on Cloud Kingdom. Going CC first, I basically have to wall in with my buildings in order to survive a baneling bust or some similar all in. And when I add an add on to one of the buildings in the wall, my only buildings this early in the game, it gets picked off by six zerglings, and there's nothing I could do about it, regardless of having a marine in a bunker, and rushing to repair. 

In a lot of cases, a marauder hellion timing push in my case, this basically kills any and all chances of my build working, through no fault of my own, simply because I can only place add-ons in a vulnerable, easily prone to attack location. Even if it didn't, there's no reason that they shouldn't be allowed on either side, other than it being graphically difficult at the moment. It makes macroing in the mid to late game insanely more difficult than it is for Protoss or Zerg, who can add buildings with little to no regard for where they go, whereas Terran has to place buildings perfectly in order to allow add ons, lest they be required to rearrange and lift them later, adding to the chore that is Terran macro. 

QXC wrote a blog post about it a while back : http://www.complexitygaming.com/forums/entry.php?b=1989

Please, Blizzard? It's a new expansion, a perfect opportunity for this change to be made. It's a huge pain.

Here's some of the Terran builds that I've been seeing a lot this weekend that have had success.

MKP's TvT build from Game 1 and Game 2.
__________________________________________

This build didn't win him the games but I thought it was a really good example of aggressive TvT utilizing a fast hellion drop into a marine/tank/banshee all in. It's intended to be aggressive but can also be used in a reactionary way imo, maybe getting widow mines instead of hellions or opting to get fast tanks.

10 Depot

12 Rax

13 Gas

Orbital Command

Factory @ 100 gas

Take 2nd gas

2 marines and then a reactor on the barracks @ 50 gas

Swap barracks and factory and start producing 2x hellions. Also start your starport

Tech lab on barracks

After you get 4 hellions load them up in the medivac and boost them to your opponents base for a drop. Go for workers and try not to lose the hellions or medivac. 

Put the factory onto the tech lab you just built on the barracks and put the barracks onto the reactor. Also start a tech lab on the Starport for banshees or a raven.

Make marines from reactored barracks, tanks, and banshees from the starport. MKP did banshees the first game and used them to harass Jjakji's mineral line before he pushed. This is a good idea but DO NOT LOSE THEM!!!

Push out with 3 tanks, lots of naked marines and 2 or so banshees. This is about as all in as it gets, so hopefully you can win. 

___________________________________________________________
Flash/Innovation's Reaper opening in TvZ

I've seen this build and slight variations of it a ton this weekend from Terran players. The new reaper is very fast and has a lot of potential when Zergs opt to go for a later pool.

10 Depot

12 Rax

12 Gas

16 Reaper @50 gas/OC/Depot... Also send the scv who finishes the barracks to scout and start a bunker at the natural of zerg. Don't let him die.

Harass with your first reaper, but do not lose it. Make sure you rally the new reapers. I haven't seen anyone go for more than 3 reapers, just use your judgement on whether to get the 3rd one or not. Keep going for workers and letting them heal in the bunker if it gets up. With 3 you should be able to take out a queen easily as long as you micro well and don't get caught by lings and stuff.

Back at home during this you should start a Command Center, then a reactor on the Barracks and a factory when you can afford it. You want to get hellions quickly to deal with the inevitable counter attack. 

Now that you have 4-6 hellions and 3 reapers you can harass a TON. Deny creep, kill queens, kill lings, deny expos, and just basically have complete map control. Just be sure to keep an eye on this little force and not let it get surrounded by lings or something. Innovation actually outright beat Leenock with this hellion/reaper aggression killing 3 queens and bbq'ing drones. Its very very powerful and seems incredibly fun to do! The biggest weakness to this is the zerg going fast muta, so just be mindful and use a reaper to scout! Reapers are basically Terran observers that can kill drones, so use them as such

During the reaper/hellion harass if I remember correctly we saw both players adding on a 3 CC, 2 ebay's, and more barracks. Its up to you whether to go for the quick CC, from this point its really what ever you want to do and is pretty much completely situational, but this is the opening which is the part to learn.

Also something to keep in mind about this opening is that Polt also did it where he went 11 rax/11 gas and proxied the Rax, and there is also the new 8/8/8 variation of the reaper opening, but I feel that while the 8/8/8 is probably the most powerful, its really risky because if they find the proxy or get an early drone scout in and see the 8 gas (lol) then it will be pretty hard to get the 2nd rax up like you are supposed to. So the 12/12 or 11/11 is a little safer and still has the potential to do damage. Go make Zerg's cry!
______________________________________________________

TvP Widow Mine opening

I saw this build a ton this weekend from players like Innovation, Taeja, and MVP. It seems to be the way to go, as the old standard (1rax fe into 3 rax) seems to be weak to a lot of new protoss timings. I'm sure this build is posted somewhere else, it seems to be very popular, but I'll go ahead and repost it just so I have a TvP game in here!

10 Depot

12 Barracks

15 Gas

16 Marine/Orbital Command

2 marines then reactor on the barracks

Command Center

Factory

So youll want to pump marines from the reactored barracks, widow mines from the factory, and get a starport going asap for the medivac.

You can do a drop with widow mines and marines, you can try and storm the front which can work, but be careful of the MS Core and try not to lose everything. This build kind of relies on doing a bit of damage so try and make it happen. This build also gets you enough marines to hold off early aggression such as Momma Core harass and gateway stuff, just make sure to plant mines in good spots if you fear these things and to throw down bunkers if you are scared. 

After your pressure the Protoss you want to start adding on additional rax, 2x ebays, and a third. A weakness of this build is that you will be quite behind in upgrades like stim and +1, so you need to get those going asap. The plus to it is that it allows you to pressure and possibly kill a ton of workers with the mines as well is take a defensive posture if needed. :D


I didn't put supply depot timings and stuff like that, just build them when you need them. Also these are just openings to get you into midgame. What you do after this is very dependent on how your opponent reacts to this stuff or what he throws at you, so adjust as needed. The main thing I've taken away from the last two days is that reapers are good now, and that HOTS has a lot of awesome new options for Terran to use for harassment. I'm sure you guys have been noticing speed medivac drops are pretty goddamn good, use them! Anyway, thats just a few of the main ones I've noticed. I have more, but I'm watching VODS to make sure I have them right, I'll post more tomorrow. Hopefully these help you on ladder :D

I want to announce that I am stepping down as a moderator of this subreddit. I joined the sub when the community was a whopping 75 people, and it has been crazy to watch it grow up to nearly 4k and the growth hasn't stopped.

I haven't been playing for a while now, but when I was playing for hours everyday, it was this community and the StarCraft Strategy team speak that helped me improve my game and gave me moral support. In particular, it was NoseKnowsAll and Echo who helped me the most and would coach me. I can't thank them enough.

I don't think I could ever give back to this community the amount that it gave me, but I am happy with the custom css and design I created way back when. It was awesome to hear your encouragement when it was first put up, and it is awesome to see that it has stood the test of time for the most part.

Why am I stepping down? I don't play anymore, and I don't feel like I'm a member of the community anymore. We have more than enough great mods, and I don't want to waste space in the sidebar. I haven't had access to my bnet account since July or so, and I haven't tried to get it unlocked because I don't really have the time or urge to play anymore either.

It has been a great ride, thank you /r/AllThingsTerran.

Auto-repair alone prioritizes units (other SCVs) over structures and that isn't what you want when repairing bunkers. As long as the SCVs are right up against the bunker, hold position will force them to repair the bunker instead of bunching up and repairing each other.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,icon-rank-masters,True,t3_16gaj5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/16gaj5/bunker_repair_tip/,

First of all I want to talk about TvP and the widow mine opening. In pretty much every TvP this weekend everyone opened up with the widow mine opening that goes like

12 Barracks

15 Gas

17 OC

Reactor on Barracks after 2 marines and then a Factory and Starport etc.
etc.etc... A popular variant of this opening is in the other thread

Well one thing I also noticed was the potential for this build to be excellent for offense and defense. Especially against builds like Blink Stalkers. A great thing about this build is that first of all you have that early reactored barracks to pump out marines to hold off MS Core pokes and stuff which were pretty common, but also you have all the tech you need to stop certain all ins. For blink stalkers instead of widow mines we saw Innovation and MVP put a tech lab on the Factory and get some tanks and well as some bunkers to hold off the Blink Stalkers. This wasn't really viable in WoL because you needed the upgrade for siege tech, but now the tanks come with it! So if you need em its really easy to pump out a few tanks to assist in your defense. 
 
This widow mine opening has some really cool aggressive options with players both trying to drop mines in mineral lines or just straight up pushing the front with marines and mines. One cool thing I thought about was dropping 1 mine in the mineral line and then boosting the medivac to quickly drop the other mine on the ramp where the probes will probably retreat, you can get some juicy kills if he just doesn't see it and even if he does you have his based mined until he gets detection :D For the price of 75/25 its pretty cost effective.

Innovation vs Flash Game 3

Hellion/Marine Elevator Opening

This series between Flash and Innovation was probably the best TvT I have ever seen. The multitasking, constant drops, mech vs bio game, decision making and everything was just awesome. I highly recommend watching it if you haven't already. So in Game 3 Innovation does a really cool Marine/Hellion Elevator opening that was very powerful and at the same time not too bad on the economy. The swapping of add ons several times is also something I really liked, quite ""Innovative"" I think.

10 Depot

12 Barracks (Scout on 13)

15 Gas

16 OC/Depot/Marine

After 2 marines start a reactor on the barracks

Command Center

Factory

2x marine production from Barracks until Factory finishes, then swap for reactored hellions and make marines out of the naked rax

Starport after Factory finishes

(Remember to make your natural into an Orbital Command)

Once you get 4 hellions and a Medivac, load up 8 marines into the Medivac (which you should have from earlier) and have the hellions follow across the map to elevator into your opponents main. When elevatoring your units in try to find a spot where he won't see you doing it, it will be a lot better. Be careful of widow mines, sack a marine to set it off if you are worried. If your opponent isn't prepared you will do massive damage to his economy, just try not to lose all the units, make good trades if you have to trade

Back at home Innovation swapped his Barracks back onto the Reactor and started a Tech lab on the Factory for tanks. From here you could decide to all in with tanks marines and even some banshees if you want. Another thing you can do that we saw another players do in similar situations is start a Tech Lab on the Barracks as soon as you move out looking to start stim/cs soon. Let's assume we do it that way instead of the all in from here on..

So tech lab on Barracks/Widow Mines from Reactored Factory and probably add all your gas, that seems like the logical thing to do anyway.

3rd CC and 2x Engineering Bays because you will be behind on upgrades.

And add on more barracks while seeing if you can harass more with drops while also placing widow mines in good spots such as watchtowers, places on the map that make sense, etc. Or you could just make tanks and skip mines, its up to you. Remember these are just openings, you have to play the game, not the build order. 

____________________________________________

Flash's CC First TvZ

Flash had a ton of games where he went CC first against Zerg. Here's kind of the average game of that.


10 Depot

15 Command Center(Flash opted to build it on the low ground, which is pretty ballsy. I would just build it at the top of the ramp like most people do)

16 Rax

17 Gas

Factory

Orbital Commands when natural finishes on both CC's

After 2 marines start a reactor on the Barracks

Flash goes for a 3rd CC here :o

Swap factory onto reactor----&gt;Reactored Hellions

Tech Lab on Barracks

2nd Gas

Start Stim and 2 engineering bays. Use the hellions for map control and denying creep

Add on more Barracks, get those upgrades rolling and eventually switch to widow mine production out of the Reactored Factory.

That's pretty much the opening, the coolest thing about this build and really most of Flash's games was his use of what Day[9] called Biomine. It's a lot more mobile than marine/tank, it lets you do stuff like attack the third @ around 9-10 minutes with a smaller bio force using mines to 
kill lings/banes that rush down a ramp at you while also having the other part of your army speeding around the map in medivacs dropping everywhere.

___________________________________________________

Polt's Reaper Expand

In Polt's games vs Creator we saw him opening up with a reaper, not really for damage but for scouting. Reapers are really fast and with Protoss lately liking to do a lot of proxy stargate and different shenanigans the reaper can definitely help you get a good read on what your opponent is doing.

10 Depot

12 Barracks

13 Gas

Reaper

Orbital Command @ Main

Command Center

Depot

Tech Lab on Rax as soon as the Reaper is done

Start Stim right away and add on 2 additional Barracks

2nd gas around this time

Factory/ E-bay

Get add ons when the 2 Barracks finish

3rd Gas

Starport @100% Factory

And I mean at this point its starting to look like good old WoL TvP. You can go for the 10 minute timing attack w/ drops or pressure at the front or both. The strength of this build is allowing you to get a good read on your opponent early on at a low cost, as reapers do not require tech labs anymore. Not the most innovative new build, but I like it. It can also make protoss overreact to your reaper, maybe thinking there will be more coming. 

____________________________________________________

That's all for tonight, it's like 3 am and I am exhausted from this amazing weekend. :D Such a great tournament and an awesome way to start off Heart of the Swarm. I can't wait to see how the meta game will pan out in the next few weeks. Hopefully this stuff can give you a start in HOTS! I also post some stuff in /r/allthingsprotoss and /r/allthingszerg if you want some Protoss or Zerg builds from this weekend. The Terran ones are probably better though, since I main Terran. Anyway let me know how these work on ladder and also if I made any mistakes in the builds. I think they are fairly accurate though :D GLHF!

Lastly, if any of you see a particularly SICK build with HotS units come out of any pro, and it doesn't look like we've written anything related to it up on the site, link me to the VOD/replay.  **And if you can come up with at least two VODs/replays of a pro doing the same build, I will literally drop everything and get you a fully written up build in like less than one day.  That's a guarantee!**

Here's where I could theoretically link you to our Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, etc, but instead here's a helpful micro nugget that maybe not all of you know of:

In TvX, when you move out with an early widow mine drop, first medivac boost in towards your opponent's main ramp and drop a single widow mine there before you do anything else.  If you have a burrowed widow mine on his ramp, then you've slowed down your opponent sooo much at being able to move his army between his main and natural, and you'll have more time to position/set up your drop in either his main or nat (depending on where your opponent's army is not).

Every now and then I see the familiar plea for a simple 2 base all-in for TvP as an alternative to the dreaded bio vs deathball late game.  Well, plea no more, for below is a quick guide to an extremely powerful Thor/Marine/Banshee all-in that I've been using with a lot of success for a few seasons now.

Want to know what it's about without all the effort of reading (I mean, who has time for reading these days?  This isn’t the dark ages)?  Well, here's an example of me executing the build vs the self-proclaimed ‘God of Protoss’ CombatEx, as cast by Ibigandscary over at /r/castit.  Plenty of mistakes on my part, and still pretty one side: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb7Nn8NdbqI

Update: cast of me beating SlayerSArthur with the build: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8288cQF71w

**Concept**

The idea is simple.  You keep the Protoss economy under control and the army contained through constant Banshee harass, and then move out at ~15 minutes to hit them hard with mass repaired Thors out of 2 Factories (never die (especially with +2 Armour), do good DPS), Banshees out of 2 Starports (very good DPS, can target fire down key units), and Marines out of 3 Barracks (mineral sink, help clean up Zealots and other Gateway units/Immortals, as well as any Stargate play).

Tired of having to double the APM of your opponent?  Well this is as close to an a-move attack as you're going to get with Terran, and most Protosses find themselves at a complete loss for what to do.  It's perhaps for this reason that it was so popular in Korea for a period last year, being utilised by Nada and Jjakjji amongst others in top level tournaments.

Disclaimer time.  The build noted below has been modified from the one I originally copied from Jjakjji.  I get gas at 15 instead of 13 so that I can get a faster expansion, I don't get a reactor on the original rax to save on gas, and I take a third base where he went totally all-in.  These changes have their strengths but also their weaknesses (eg. 15 gas is more vulnerable to some early timings than 13 gas, but you’ll have a bigger army for the final push).  You can reverse my changes if you're so inclined.

**The Build**

This is the rough build order, though obviously you'll want to use your judgement (eg. in the CombatEx game I delay my Marines and Bunker because he goes Nexus first, thus meaning no early Stalker poke, and as a result I can afford to get my CC much faster at no extra risk).

10 Depot

12 Barracks (@completion 3 Marines)

14 Depot (complete wall-off to prevent scouting)

15 Refinery

17 Orbital Command

@100 gas, Factory

Second Refinery

@100 minerals, Bunker at natural to fake 1rax FE -- want to start this around 4 minutes at the latest so it's up in time for the Zealot/Stalker poke.

Command Centre at natural.

@Factory complete, Starport, Tech Lab on Factory.

Depot

@Starport complete, switch onto Tech Lab, Cloak, Banshee.

@100 gas, Armoury.

Tech Lab on Factory.

Third and Fourth Refinery.

Second Banshee.

Depot (Depots after this as necessary).

Thor.

+1 Vehicle Armour Plating (@100%, start +2 Vehicle Armour Plating).

After Second Banshee, Raven, then constant Banshee and Thor production.

@200 spare gas, add second Factory and Starport.  Constant Banshee/Thor production out of both.

@300 spare minerals, add 2 more Barracks.  Constant Marine production.

@400 spare minerals, add Command Centre then Ebay.

@~14 minutes, start researching Strike Cannons, add 1 Viking.

@~15 minutes, with +2 Plating and Strike Cannon complete, push out with Thors, Banshees, Marines and 16 SCVs on auto-repair.  Secure third with PF, continue rallying units.

**The Wait**

While you wait to build up your army you should be constantly harassing with Banshees.  Send them out and kill every Probe you can, if you can't get to a Probe, kill Stalkers, Sentries, Pylons, tech, or hell, even a Nexus.  Basically anything you can get your hands on to keep him damaged and paranoid.  When they get injured bring them back to repair, then send your every growing fleet out once more.  Do your very best not to lose any.

**Dealing with Aggression**

There's a chance that a Protoss will try to hit you with a 1 or 2 base all-in before you do your push.  In the case of 1 base all-ins, you should scout this coming with your original scouting SCV (get it out of the Protoss base by 4 minutes, send it back in at 5 minutes -- no expansion, something fishy).  If it looks like a 3 or 4 gate, stay up your ramp and bunker.  You win.  If it looks like a Blink, Void or Warp Prism play, you may want to also go for a Thor before the Starport since otherwise you risk a build order loss (with Thor first you can either expand as normal, or try a 1 base Thor all-in, depending on how you feel).

For 2 base all-ins, you should generally be fine so long as your macro and control is up to scratch.  Building a wall at your natural like so to bug out Zealots http://i.imgur.com/NhO3O.jpg will help a lot, and beyond that just keep repairing, keep your units from wandering too far from the wall, and snipe down anything that you can (including obs).  You may want to get Strike Cannon earlier to snag Immortals or Colossus, but dealing with this sort of thing will come with experience.  If you hold it off without nearly dying (even if they don't lose all that much), you should be able to walk over them easily with your push.

The 15 gas build as I do it only really has 1 weakness - a fast 1gate FE into 3 or 4 gate.  If executed correctly this should hit before Cloak is done or a Thor is out, meaning that you really only have 3 or 4 Marines to defend with.  The only way to deal with this is to suspect it, bunker the top of your ramp, and repair until your Banshee is out.  5, 6, 7 or 8 gates, on the other hand, should be a build order win since they have no detection.

**The Engagement**

For the most part the engagement is an a-move affair, but there are five things that you must remember to do.

First, where do you engage?  Well, obviously if he comes out to attack you he’ll have a large say in the matter, but if he has a lot of ranged units, Immortals or Storm, you’ll want to meet somewhere you can get a concave or your Thors will just be dancing about and not firing.  If he doesn’t come out to meet you it will depend somewhat on the map.  The key is that you don’t want to take too long getting into his production, because you don’t want to marginally win the battle and then lose to reinforcements.  So on a map like Cloud Kingdom I’ll go through the third (assuming he has one) because it’s basically on the way to the natural anyway, but on maps like Daybreak or Entombed I’ll go straight to the natural so that I can go for the kill rather than cripple.

Second, you want to cloak your Banshees and set them to target down any Colossus  (if there are no Colossus I usually just set them on a-move, but you can target down other things if you're so inclined).  At this time you'll also want to put down 2 PDDs from your Raven.

Third, you'll want to Strike Cannon any Immortals that are in range, which will 1-shot them and prevent them from firing in the meantime.

Fourth, you'll want to try and kill any detection in the area so that the Banshees can't be hit.  This is why I get the Viking -- so that if there are no Colossus the Observers will be shot down automatically -- but the anti-air range of the Thors is good enough that you should be able to hit it by selecting 2 Thors and target firing it.  (This isn't essential to do, but it helps.)

Fifth, if the Protoss has Storm (the only ‘normal’ thing I really fear when doing this build) you'll want to make sure you don't lose clumps of Banshees to them by splitting them, moving them, etc.  This can be tricky, but most Protosses don’t get Storm.

**The Aftermath**

When it comes down to it, this is a 2 base all-in.  If you attack and get wiped out, you're probably going to die before too long.  However, as you moved out you did get that third base up and mining (hopefully with both Refineries), so if you attack and do some good damage (maybe take out the army and third or something) but don't manage to get the killing blow, then you should be able to reload and take another swing soon after – and with the additional income you can invest in some more tech, upgrades, production, or whatever you want.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,1350714025.0,,icon-rank-masters,True,t3_10k3n5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/10k3n5/2_base_tvp_guide_marinethorbanshee/,

1364274110.0,50,self.AllThingsTerran,1b0x1s,Things you HAVE to know about Terran/Starcraft II ,Xenocider,60,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1b0x1s/things_you_have_to_know_about_terranstarcraft_ii/,"For the longest time I've been receiving questions like ""How do I macro better, how do I raise my APM, why is Flash so good, and most importantly, how do I **really** improve"" I'm going to condense the answers to these questions and more in this one post


To start off I'd like to address how the average ladder player (maybe you!) will confront playing on the ladder. ""I really want to improve, I want to have good mechanics, but I'm terrible in everything, what do I do? I guess I'll just keep playing and things will get better"" This is true, no matter what if you just play the game you will get better, even if by the slightest amount. However this is not the correct way to approach improving in SC2, if you want faster macro, faster APM, you have to know what you're doing. It's all about the game plan, a good EPM (effective actions per minute) and good macro come from knowing what's going to happen next. 

Essentially, your APM and your macro reflect how much you know about the game. I'll give you an example, imagine you're going a hellion 3oc vs a 9 roach rush off 2 base. The roaches come to your base and you have hellions + 1 marauder off a techlabed rax that you reacted with. You stave off the roaches but took damage and you're both relatively even in terms of economy/supply. What's next? Do you know what's next? Do you have a plan? Did you even react enough to hold off the roaches in the first place? 

This is the most important part in SC2 macro/mechanics. If you throw down 4 more raxes is that enough for a 3 base economy? What about upgrades when do I put those down, and when do I attack? When you have the answers to all of these questions, only then can you make leaps in your macro/mechanics. This is just one example of course, and there's over thousands of these in SC2. 

This brings me to the next point of, why are Kespa T so damn good at SC2? Kespa T have something that other players in the world just don't have, and that is precision in everything that they do. When Innovation does a build he doesn't fuck around, when he's at the enemy base I can guarantee you that his +1/stim/combat shield will all finish at the same time, and that his 3rd base will align to get him enough gas for his +3/+3 upgrades 10 minutes later into the game. This of course really isn't that complicated, it just requires /focused/ practice. 

All it takes is a look at your replay, ""Did I need one or two more barracks there? Maybe an extra gas as well."" I read so many posts across all forums saying ""Damn X mechanic is so broken, there's LITERALLY no way to hold X"" then what about you? How structured is your build and your game knowledge that would allow you to hold off that mechanic? Improving in SC2 isn't really that hard, Up to the highest level of play (and even then) the strategy isn't complicated, 95% of games end with a ""o I'll drop here and.. maybe send my army at a seperate base... and well there's a win I guess"" 

As long as you find a build you can improve with (a standard macro focused build, not some extremely greedy 4oc build) and play 1000 games in each matchup while reflecting back on each game, you can join top 16 GM.

Conclusion: Too many people make Starcraft out to be much harder than it really is, all it takes is a good attitude and free time and anyone can improve a great deal. When you structure your layout and develop a solid plan for every time in the game in each matchup, the entirety of your mechanics will follow (micro/macro/map awareness/etc) If you lose to something like a stupid all-in, look at the replay and never lose to it again, don't just rage-reque you'll never learn. Finally; if you really want to improve stop doing all-ins, you will seriously never improve in the long term if you just 8/8/8 every game, it will give you short-term happiness but long-term depression! 

Don't fall for the prostitute reaper cheeses! Macro will be harder in the short term, believe me I was once a low-masters T and if any of you reading are low-masters T you'll understand that there has been no greater hell ever created which equals the anguish of being a low masters T.

P.S: People like Polt have ""relatively"" low APM but extremely high EPM which is why I wanted to make sure it came across that game plan = EPM not just spam click APM, if you want to increase your APM and have it actually impact your game go practice.

This ended up being a lot longer than I was planning, but at least I have something to send to people that ask now.

This is my first ever post on /r/starcraft, and I have decided to create a controversial thread, where I will attempt to convey my opinion to the community of the point at where the Starcraft 2 balance is regarding the Terran race. What drove me to write this article as a zerg was firstly seeing all professional Terrans lose to other races regardless of their insane skill, added to the fact that Terran is now so easy to roll over with the two other races.

Personally, I started playing sc2 around March 2011, where I stopped playing Warcraft 3 and transitioned to sc2. Ever since, I worked my way out of bronze (I started at the beginning of season 2) and since the end of season 5, I have been in mid/high masters. I am a Zerg, and I remember the majority of the matches first few matches I played against Terran, I would usually think ""Terran is just imba and broken"". This was at the time that Terran was dominating the professional scene, and I was myself terribly frustrated by Terran strats and build orders that would just tear me apart. I would watch the GSL, MLG's and many other tournaments and in the initial months of the year 2011, Terran players (especially Korean Terran players) would just dominate tournaments. However, this trend has been severely reversed ever since the Terran race has constantly been nerfed, leading to an eventual huge gap in balance between Terran and the two other races.

As far as I can recall, in nearly all of the recent patches, Terran have been continuously been nerfed. Every time Terran players created innovative and creative builds that would completely annihilate their opponents (blue flame elevator popularized at MLG by team SlayerS, Thorzain’s two base mech against Protoss), there would be a wave of balance whine within the community, and instead of players searching how to counter these strategies, they would simply wait for blizzard’s nerf. The Terran ghost nerf was the icing on the Terran nerf cake, seeing as the ghost was the only Terran unit that could deal with T v Z late game tech switches (Ultralisks and Broodlords), which now leaves the Terran race stuck with the same army composition throughout the late game, as the one which they had in the midgame (marine/marauder/sieged tanks/medivacs).

Regarding engaging battles, Terran have the hardest time of all three races. When they are faced against Protoss and Zerg, where the Protoss can effectively a-move his zealots (with charge) and use his colossi and high templars to deal area of effect damage, and where the zerg can easily a-move his zerg lings/ultralisks/banelings and fungal the Terran army to stop him for microing, the Terran has to be patient and spread his siege tanks, spread his unit to avoid spells such as fungal growth, storm and force field that rip the Terran army to shreds. Even with all this micro, the Terran is not always assured to win the battle, and countless times have I seen games where a Terran wins all the fights in the mid game/late game with good micro and has a solid macro behind, but still lose to Zerg and Protoss due to both races replenishing capacity. An incontestable fact is that Terran is the least forgiving race of the game, because if due to one micromanagement mistake they lose all their army, they will not be able to replenish their army as fast as Zerg or as Protoss.

Many Images and Professional interviews merely echo my thoughts:
The recent “Terran Holocaust Image” - 

http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/2509/tgth.jpg

DongRaeGu’s MLG winner Interview – But Z v T became…as long as I don’t make a mistke – regardless of whether my opponent plays well or not – as long I don’t make a mistake, I play thinking I am going to win. The queen range buff was just so huge.

MarineKingPrime’s Idea of Balance - 

https://twitter.com/MKPS2/status/210345589035114499

Even if these sources are select, and there might be a bit of bias present, but the uncontested fact is that Terran is the hardest race to use in the game, and that this high skill race does not always offer high reward.

Again, this is not a post to talk about which race is the strongest or whether Zerg or Protoss is better against Terran, but a post about a mere contemplation of the constant nerfs the Terran race has undergone, and me voicing my opinion that Terran is the weakest race of the game by far. Thank you for reading this post, and if you have any feedback or suggestions on how to improve my future posts, I would welcome them greatly.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,,True,t3_wmsga,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/wmsga/the_never_ending_tragedy_of_the_terran_race/,

I am sure some of you already know what i am talking about. For those who have no idea what this is, please read this

http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1b6f8z/hi_i_will_be_attempting_to_create_the_p90x/

Just for summary, this is a supposed 30 days of free coaching in a step by step procedure where a lower level player will have a great sense of guidance what to work on and improve in a lecture based style. So instead of playing many hours wasting time experimenting what is right or wrong, the training program shows you the way. This will save additional time for those who work with limited play hours (Thus the limited time they play, they get more out of it), it will also help lower level players improve instead of wasting countless hundreds to thousands of game with no direction or aim, and it will help those who need good coaching but cant afford it. Just remember this program isnt a ""Automatic i will get better"" guide... Just like a normal workout program, you only benefit it if you actually attempt it and try. And obviously the more time you invest, the more you get in return. 

I have not tested this with anyone yet (Meaning this isnt a complete thing yet). The beta test of the program generally covers the first 7 days. I have so far been working on the 5th day, meaning i should be done maybe during the weekend. The lectures and such are there, however it needs to be also simple enough for anyone to understand and work in a proper chronological order in terms what to work on. Anyone who wants to take part in this beta testing will have to be reminded that THIS ISNT A COMPLETE PRODUCT YET. And because you are doing the program partially, you wont get the full benefits as if its a complete product. If anything, it will ""spoil"" you and give improper direction of improvement as a possibility. So please be aware what you are getting yourself into. If you are seriously into this to get the most out of it, you should wait till after its complete.

The test subjects i will require are gold, plats, and diamond league players. Each tester will be given a beta copy with no instructions. The instructions are already there inside the thing to see if people can understand it without another person explaining it. I will create the beta group on bnet (Will be invites only) and get personal response, suggestions, improvements, and any form of feedback needed to change the program. There possibly will be gramatical and spelling errors, etc. If anyone is interested in ""spicing up"" the quality such as better picture, format of how the folder are organized, grammer check, instead of doing the program itself please message as well.

Please post below your league, character name and code, points, best and worst matchup, and style of play if you are interested in taking part of the program. I will need alot of feedback to make MAJOR MAJOR adjustments to make sure everything perfectly works. Those who are taking part in this test should be serious about this and not take it as if its about fun or sense of self improvement. You guys are part of a group that will help many players improve to great lengths to make sure we kick protoss and zerg ass. Their tears will empower us. I hope everyone read this carefully and good luck.

And i need to figure out where i can upload this beta version in the meantime. The official version (When its ready) will be on my team's website.

Meanwhile at Camp Terran, we need to build an engineering bay in order to get a Turret, which is starting to become frustrating, especially against Protoss cheeses. 



Blink Stalker All-In? Gotta build a turret to help prevent observer/MSC spotting the high ground. 

Oracles? Yup, you're gonna need a turret son, because those floating seashells will melt your marines quicker than you can say gg. 

DT rush? Sorry, you used all your mules to keep up in terms of economy, better get to building that engineering bay. 

While it is true that we have these things called ""scans""--the problem is that by the time a cheese hits, we'll have 1 or at most 2 scans available. This is exacerbated if there are worker losses and you need every mule to keep up a defense. 

It also tends to discourage TvP mech play, as an engineering bay is primarily used for infantry upgrades and basically useless but we need to get it anyways, because turrets. 

Removing the engineering bay requirement would decrease the prevalence of cheesy openings in TvP and promote macro-oriented games, as well as make the handling of cheese tenable in lower leagues.

I've made some videos going over some openings that I have been doing for a little while now in the HoTS beta. I've only been playing it for about 2 weeks or so, but I've logged a couple hundred games.

I'm not the greatest (mid/high master forever now) and HoTS is a new frontier. There may be some things that I just can't foresee that these builds are terrible against, that's why any feedback is totally appreciated and maybe we can get some discussion going.

**TvT:**

Reactor Widowmine FE: http://youtu.be/WDNJVIhlRco

1/1/1 Marine tank all in: http://youtu.be/vlpvafAwccA

Both of these videos feature *shutting down hellbat drops*. The widowmine opening seems solid,..maybe, have a look and give me your thoughts.

1 base Hellbat/Tank all in by Kitten: http://youtu.be/GsmaoJdcRCY

The 1 base build is unrefined and just a quick fun all in, but the hellbat drop into mech play feels really nice. I will be making another video in the future talking more about the mid and late game, which is ultra fun in HOTS. Feedback appreciated here as well :)

**TvP:**

This build is really awesome, Kitten is a really awesome NA 1 base terran and has already come up with great HOTS builds. I have a feeling a lot of people are going to love this build. Try it out and maybe find some cool variations to share with everyone if you would be so inclined :)

### The replay

The replay for this Master Class is Teaja vs Stephano from Dreamhack Valencia. The replay is a couple of weeks old, but that shouldn't be an issue.

[Replay Link](http://drop.sc/267488)


### How does this work?

Watch the replay, then provide your analysis in the form of **small, digestible** bits of information. We don't want essays, just a few sentences per comment. Feel free to make multiple comments if you have different insights to provide.

Additionally, feel free to ask any questions you may have about the game: For example, ""Why did Taeja do X, could he have done Y?"". Be specific with your questions!

Friendly debate is encouraged if you disagree with analysis provided by a fellow Terran. Keep it civil.

Here are some of the things I learned.

* You do NOT have to all-in protoss in order to win the late game.  Instead, focus on keeping the economy of both players lower in order to use your bio army to its best.
* Delay ghosts in favor of more medivacs/vikings/bio.  With more pure ARMY, you are able to do some of the things that I'm about to talk about:
* With a larger army, you can split up half of your army in order to force your opponent AWAY from the deathball.  Half of your army attacking the 4th, 2 vikings denying a warp prism.  Threatening a quadruple drop into the main.  All are totally viable.
* **YOUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO DENY YOUR OPPONENT'S THIRD FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.** Polt every single game he played was capable of denying protoss their third until at least 3 minutes after he got his third.  This is because he was heavily committing to army and multi-pronged attacks.  At some point, he was able to make a successful move.
* Don't overcommit to any one attack.  The easiest way to lose is ball up everything and just go for it.  However, every single time that Polt made an attack, it was in order to somehow sneak a double drop into the main/deny the third/etc as above.  Only until he had overwhelming army advantage did he just outright attack.
* Remember that medivacs are fast.  You can 99% of the time just get everything out of there by loading up into the medivacs and just boosting away.

1370640945.0,47,self.AllThingsTerran,1fw1f5,TvP: CC first. Safest build we have.,StrykerzD,51,4,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1fw1f5/tvp_cc_first_safest_build_we_have/,"So I've seen an abundant amount of posts about TvP and how hard it is, difficult, etc. Rather than copy pasting what I believe on every single thread, I've decided to make my own thread about the issue.

With that being said, I believe a certain variation of CC first (what quantic apoc has recently done, what mvp used to do in WOL) is the safest and most reliable style we have currently in the meta game. All of this reaper open and reactor openers were good when protoss played EXTREMELY greedy. Protoss have wised up a bit to this, and now we find ourselves getting no information, no economic damage, and dying to something we couldn't see.

So why is CC first safer? Well, you get a barracks at 15 and 16 supply, which means you have more marines than you would doing any other form of fast expansion. I also follow this up with two extra barracks, totaling four, rather quickly (~28 supply). This means my army is huge, at a sacrifice of tech (medivacs) However, that's never been a deterrent for me, and in past experiences, have been why terran are losing so hard. We have medivacs, but not enough dps to stay alive.

To continue, I play cc first what appears to be EXTREMELY greedy. I make a third base around 6:30, with 4 rax and double gas. I get a total of three tech labs and one reactor after I start stim. This allows a massive influx of marauders be it vs blink all in, or immortal sentry.

What's the major downfall of this style of cc first? Well, the medivacs primarily. Lately I've found myself dropping later and fewer times vs protoss due to the nexus cannon's beefiness, so this doesn't really bother me anymore.

Here a few replays, some vs all ins and some macro games on NA and KR of me solely using this cc first build.

a. When loading units into bunkers, but you just want the 4 supply to go in, and the rest of the selected army to stop in their tracks and not surround the bunker.

b. When loading units into Medivacs, and avoiding some Bio following the Medivacs because they can't fit

**2) Select Current Worker (I have this bound to Q):**

I find this helps eliminate the step of specificaly selecting workers from your constructing buildings and rallying them to a new position (typically the mineral line). For example, When I add 2 more Barracks, rather than trying to box the SCVs and send them back, I'll just add the Barracks to my Production Control Group (I keep Rax, Factories, and Ports all on 4), press ""4"" then ""Q"" and it will select all the units that are constructing buildings in that current selection. This is also great for Supply Depot SCVs as well, as they are often strewn around your base. I Ctrl + Click the Depots, press ""Q"" and then I have all those SCVS selected.

**3) The ""Choose Ability or A.I. Target"" has much more depth than people give it credit.** You can use this for ANY ability, even when it's just bound to ""R."" If you didn't know about the basic form of this, I'll explain real quick. When you rebind this to ""R,"" your sniper round and heat seaker missiles are now selected AND casted with the same key: ""R"". This means you can just hover your cursor over a unit or group of units and hold down ""R"" to cast it repeatedly. But what you can also do is press ""E"" for mules, then hold Shift + R and they will drop wherever your mouse cursor is until you let go.

**4) Lowering and Raising Depots can be bound to 2 different hotkeys.** I use ""R"" for Raise and ""Z"" for lower.

**5) Medivacs follow the Last In -&gt; First Out priority system.** So if you load up 6 Marines followed by a Widow Mine, that Widow Mine is going to be the first thing to pop out of the drop, unless micro'd specifically.

**6) When adding your additional SCV's to gas**, you can select workers that are heading back to the CC with minerals in their hands as well, send them to the Refinery, but press ""C"" before they get there and they will return the minerals, and then head to the refinery.

One of your Hero Terrans popped over recently for some information on 2 base play from Zerg and how to scout it. I figured I'd repost the information for everyone to share and enjoy :D

&gt;Some Zerg tells that a 2 base all-in or 2 base tech aren't often what you initially think - I don't have a list of VODs, but I'll (sadly!) give you some secrets and 'tells' you might not be aware of. Assuming you open with maybe an scv scout, into 2 reaper/4 hellions + stim/insurance marauder, you can check for a lot of things.

&gt;I'll start with the SCV scout, and the follow up reaper: If you scout hatch gas pool instead of hatch pool gas, you can start thinking about the possibility of aggression or tech. We took our gas earlier! In ZvZ you can often tell that early aggression is going to happen because of the earlier gas, which isn't the initial thought as the pool is slightly later.

&gt;Our 2 base plays, be it tech/timings/all-ins will often have only 2 queens, so our creep spread is minimal. Your hellions won't have any tumors to deny, MAYBE one if the zerg doesn't inject as well or has a slightly different build order.

&gt;Hyun has a early Roach pressure build that is the next earliest thing to worry about. We can open standard, hatch pool gas, but make a roach warren after our 2 queens on 28 supply (4:30). If you scout something that early, its a play designed to kill SCVs (most pressure builds are). There will also be a flood of 3 overlords at once, so if you see a group of overlords leaving our base at once instead of one at a time, this can also be a tell for a roach pressure (they require a lot of supply!). The initial batch should hatch around 6:00, and it should be 12~ in number. This is why I like making a marauder first (and sometimes second) out of my tech lab rax when I play terran.

&gt;Pressures or all-ins after this time can include a roach baneling attack, roach speedling, speedling baneling. Often the difference between a pressure and an all-in in these scenarios is whether you consistently see reinforcing speedlings or not. If you see the reinforcing speedlings, you can think about sac-ing some SCVs in order to stay alive, otherwise try to avoid it! More marauders and bunkers, and ideally siege tanks will stop these dead in their tracks.

&gt;Scouting the 2 base all-ins without seeing them can be awkward, but we can potentially be fully saturated on 2 base quite early - which means you can see a large spurt of zerglings or roaches around 7:30. This is either Zerg saying ""I need to defend your hellions because I'm going 2 base tech"" (spine crawler can hint towards tech), or ""I am going to execute a timing/all-in now, as I have all the drones I need"". Dropping a scan at 7:20ish can help you if you're super unsure.

&gt;6 minutes is when a standard macroing Zerg will place their 3rd base (assuming no reaper) and additional geysers, and 7:00 is when x2 evos should be placed. If you don't see any of these, this is also a potential tell towards 2 base.

&gt;As for 2 base tech, our lair tech can potentially go down around as early as 6:50-7:00, which means a spire will finish at 8:40, mutalisks finish at 9:13 and they're in your base at 10:00. Infestors will also be out at a similar time to the Mutalisks, but if you scout a 2 base infestation pit you should also be aware of 2 base Swarm Host Nydus (I don't think this is very good vs Terran personally).

&gt;In summary, some tells of 2 base tech/pressure/all-ins are: Lack of creep (I don't need creep for this game/I need all my energy to be put into injecting my hatcheries for larva), lack of queens (2 is obvious, 3+ is still possible but it could go either way), no evo chambers at the front to deny hellions (I don't need upgrades for what I want to do), continued mining gas even in front of your SCV/reaper (I really need gas for what I want to do), spawning pool NOT wiggling after 100 gas is mined (I don't need this gas for speed), spurt of aggressive units around 7:25 (I'm saturated, now time to do SOMETHING!), multiple overlords leaving the base early on spotted by your reaper or hellions (roach pressure).

&gt;I think that mostly covers it... if you want to practice on EU with me, feel free to drop me a message at Stark.1785 on EU. I'd be happy to help you out in person.

&gt;Edit: I hope my fellow locusts don't kill my in my sleep for telling you all this :C

For the last 2 tests i had, i had lazy people who had no devotion who just wanted to see the guide hoping its some auto win stuff to get them better but its not. Its literally an instruction manuel like a unspoken coach telling you wat to do to improve. Its up to your own efforts and hard work to get there. This is merely a blue print or a map to your sucess to reach your destination.. i can only show you the way.

The next version will have details on the news section of the group. As of now there are only 6 days of the program and it mainly touches TvT. v0.30 will have up to day 10 planned.

**F&amp;Q**

* I can take part in the test?

A: Yes you may take part in the test regardless of league. I will need input from all leagues and skill level

* How should i help?

A: You the thing seriously as if your entire days worth of play is this. You follow it and not half-ass it. The guide is only is as good as the reader who tries it (Same logic as the weapon to the user). After completing each version, you can email me your reports (Make it detailed please) about what is good, bad, needs to be changed, and what you feel comfortable/uncomfortable about.

* I just want to be in the group to see the guide's progress rather than test it

A: Then you came to the wrong place, and it will hinder your play if you try to attempt the guide when its a finished product. Dont bother coming if you wont take this seriously. The whole point of the guide is to help people rather than benefit a person's selfish need.

* Will this cost money?

A: No its free. I will only accept donations at the most. If possible, i would love supporters for my stream since i am trying really hard to get a twitch partnership.

* I already did the initial beta test, does that mean i have to start over back to day 1 to do this or can i skip a few days?

A: You can choose either. But look at the changelog carefully since previous days WILL BE MODIFIED thus changing your entire experience.

* Should i wait till its a complete product to do this or should i have a head start doing it?

A: Wait till its a complete product. If you attempt this when its complete, you WILL get better the most effective way. If you take it now, it will only stunt your growth. You should ONLY take part in the test if you are serious about improving it for the sake of sc2, helping depressed/frustrated noobs, and the whole terran race.

* What skill level should i be before taking part of this test?

A: I highly recommend MINIMUM GOLD LEAGUE. Do not bother if you are bronze or silver unless you are completely desperate. Its not an easy program but it will def show the way how to play.

* I got promoted due to this incomplete guide, will i expect something better if i do it again once its complete?

1365846029.0,43,self.AllThingsTerran,1c9gbb,GosuBuilds update: 1 month after HotS,NoseKnowsAll,45,2,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1c9gbb/gosubuilds_update_1_month_after_hots/,"Well, it's official.  It's now been 1 month since Heart of the Swarm was released, and I hope you all agree with me when I say: ""Wow - what a great month it's been.""  So I decided to just do a month re-cap of everything that's happened at GosuBuilds.

We uploaded a grand-total of 21 builds in just over 30 days.  All of them can be viewed [here](http://www.gosubuilds.com/new-hots-builds/).  We had a guest submitter, Slur, write up [Polt's 2rax Reaper FE](http://www.gosubuilds.com/hots-terran/hots-tvt/tvt-2rax-reaper-fe/), and another guest submitter, Modest, write up [MKP's 1/1/1 all-in](http://www.gosubuilds.com/hots-terran/hots-tvt/tvt-mkps-111-all-in/).  Unfortunately, no Protoss or Zerg guest submitters have stepped up to the plate, but I've definitely talked to some guys out there (you all know who you are) and I couldn't have done some of the builds without you.  Thanks for that :D

Now let's look at what we're looking to do going forward.  

* More builds!
* More builds!
* Get some pro replays of more builds!

The problem I'm having, simply put, is that I can't find any new HotS builds out there that seem standard enough to post about.  This is why I'm looking for your guys' help on this matter.  **If any of you get your hands on some pro (basically Code A or Code S) replays/VODs of standard builds that are or are not already uploaded to GosuBuilds, please let me know - I'd be super appreciative of it.**  

Here are some builds that I know exist, but haven't seen a pro execute repetitively, so have been unable to write-up a good build for:

* gasless 1rax FE vs Protoss that's actually safe vs oracles
* normal 1gate FE vs Terran that isn't ridiculously weak to either reaper opener or widow mine drop
* any standard ZvT build at all
* voidray all-in in PvT
* FFE into stargate in PvZ
* phoenix build in PvP
* gasless 1rax FE into 2 base hellbat drop vs Zerg

If there are others here that I failed to mention, let me know in the comments.  Again, thanks so much for everything this month has brought us!

This isn't about balance or even the game itself. This is a problem I do feel is very serious, but there is hope, because I feel like there is something we can do about this.

So let me start off by saying this. I got this idea from reading this thread on reddit:

http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/vm9lp/dan_to_you/

Now, hear me out, I do not agree with everything the OP said (in particular that Mech isn't viable in TvT and TvZ) but it got me thinking. We really have no famous casters that actually play Terran and nobody representing us on shows like SotG.

I do feel like this is a serious problem, but before I go on this little rant please take a few seconds and read what I posted in the thread linked above. (http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/vm9lp/dan_to_you/c55opmo?context=3)

Now, with that said, I do really think that we can bring Artosis to switch back to terran. How do we do this you might ask? Well, it's simple, we start a petition. If we all rally behind this we might have a chance to bring Artosis (one of my heroes) back to playing terran.

Now, you can agree or disagree with my opinion that terran is seriously underrepresented when it comes down to famous casters and shows, but Artosis has said many times that he considers switching back to terran (on Gomtv, his personal stream), so maybe we can give him a little ""boost"" and make him switch back. Imagine an artosis hour about terran, oh boy, or imagine an artosis tvt cast and he actually knows everything about the race (and I do think he understands terran pretty well considering the fact he doesn't play terran, but some of the stuff he says is just flatout wrong in my opinion).

So what do you think fellow terrans, can we do this together? Can we bring Artosis back to our awesome race and finally have a famous caster that is actually representing our race?

I am a huge terran fan and love this race and I love artosis, so sorry if you guys disagree and feel like I'm wasting your time, but please just think about it.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,1340694986.0,,icon-rank-masters,True,t3_vmao3,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/vmao3/fellow_terrans_we_have_a_mission_lets_do_this/,
1339646266.0,40,self.AllThingsTerran,v13iw,Three Very Powerful TvZ Builds,Aristherius,43,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/v13iw/three_very_powerful_tvz_builds/,"I've noticed a lot of Terrans having trouble lately with their vs Zerg, so here's my two cents as a (crappy) High Diamond player on how I handle the matchup. The idea here is that I basically give you guys 3 builds and how to do various things.

WARNING: These builds are pretty APM/ Multitasking intensive, and also require to probably be able to marine split decently (if I say so myself, I can split rather competently.) For me to learn marine split, all I did was just go into Marine Split Challenge (map by Griffith) and just do it for a couple days non stop until I could finally do it right.

Enough dragging- onto the builds!

**FIRST BUILD: 1 Rax FE into Hellion Banshee into Standard Marine Tank Medivac.**

This is a very useful build (my go to standard) that essentially lets you hold every single early allin and get a monster economy with monster upgrades with monster map control (get it? MONSTER.)

BO:

I'll just list the standard 1rax FE here (well, my greedy one, you could play safer but I don't really care)

9 supply (you can scout here, or use the scv building this to make a rax and then scout, which is what i tend to do)

12 Barracks

16 Orbital, 16 Marine, and then CC before second depot (this is dependent  on you, you can make the second depot before the CC but I find it makes no difference so I just go CC first)

And that's it for 1Rax FE!

This is where the build changes a bit.

Get double gasses either before or after the second depot, saturate when finished (of course)

Make the factory when you have the gas by the Barracks, then make the reactor on the barracks (you should have 2-3 marines)

when the CC finishes, make it into an orbital and use the building SCV to make a bunker near your CC to stop runbys and early pressures ( this is also dependent on you, you can make it at the ramp and risk an early runby by have a later payoff as it's part of your wall, or have it by the CC to stop early runbys but risk it not reaching the ramp)

From now on, use your supply depots to wall of your natural!

When the factory is done, make a starport immediately and then swap the factory onto the reactor, start hellions, and make a techlab with the rax for the incoming starport. When the techlab is done on the rax, lift it and make a reactor with it. Pump marines from it afterwards.


Start an engineering bay around 7, research +1 weapons from it when done. 

Make hellions up until you have six, and right when the 5th and 6th hellions finish you should have your banshee out (you only need 1!)

Send your hellions to clear the watchtowers, do a small poke at their ramp, but don't lose them. If you do lose them, make sure you micro like hell and kill as many lings as possible. If you lose them to roaches, that's stupid because you can outrun them.

You should also start two additional barracks' around half way the banshee (you should have the money). Put a techlab on one (stim immediately) and reactor on the other. Pump marines constantly.

Now then, you should have 6 hellions and a banshee out, around the 8 minute mark or so. Swap the factory and starport addons, start double medivacs and tanks with siege. Grab your natural gasses at this time.

The banshee is the true beauty of this build. This baby will BLOCK EVERY ALLIN THEY SEND AT YOU. Seriously, it kills roaches, focuses banes, and does everything. THIS IS WHY YOU MUST NEVER EVER LOSE IT. I like to do a light poke with it at their main to scout any funky things, but never ever commit to an attack with it other than a couple of free drones. With this banshee, you completely deny their map vision. Simply keep it (or patrol between if more than one tower) at the tower, and you single handedly deny everything they see (other than overlord in your base.)

If you sense or see an impending allin coming from your zerg opponent (for some reason zergs try to allin 1 rax fe to punish it, but it NEVER EVER works if you have decent macro and reaction time), simply send your banshee back home and deflect it, rebuild, laugh at them, and send your banshee back to the towers or stay at home if you feel another wave is coming.

Now then, around the 12 minute mark, your banshee should be denying map vision, if your hellions are still alive they're now with your army, and your army should consist of a lot of combat shield marines with +1, tanks with siege, and around 4-5 medivacs. Build a 4th and 5th barracks, second engi bay, armory, and 3rd cc and push out. He should have absolutely no idea this attack is coming.

Unless he doesn't have one, ALWAYS attack the third. 

This is where things either get complicated or laughably easy. If they have mutas, just kill them as they can't do anything to our marine tank medivac hellion army. Seriously, they won't have enough mutas to even scratch the marines before they evaporate. But make sure you split properly versus the incoming ground force as well, especially banelings (this requires lots of practice, and this build also relies a lot on marine splitting).

If they went Infestors however, things just got needlessly complicated. Fungal growth will not only deal insane dps to your army, it will also allow banelings to roll roll roll while you try to split an immobile army. To deal with infestors, I always just split on the spot. Whenever I get close or sense an engagement, I just split. This is also why this build relies a lot on splitting. When the engagement eventually comes, you should be split and use your tanks to focus down the infestors (this is really really good for you.) 

At this point, you either have killed their army and third (good), they killed your army but you killed the third (okay), or they steamrolled your army and you didn't kill the third (gg)(I also don't know how this happens if they didn't see your attack coming.) 

Generally if I kill their third, I use the army i have at home ( I NEVER stream in units, it's just bad) to connect with the army at his base, and then kill him, simply because 2 base zerg just can't hold a marine tank push like yours.

Anyways, just go grab that third behind this attack, start +2 +2 for your bio, upgrades for tanks, and make more barracks' and factories, and whatever you need to do.

Pros: Banshee for map control, sets up standard Marine Tank Medivac Army, Hellions destroy lings.

Cons: Pretty weak without a decent ability to split, honestly.

**SECOND BUILD: Polt's Marine Marauder Hellion Timing Attack**

In my opinion, this is an absolutely awesome build that I love to use because I love bio as a terran. But once again, this build will usually require you to have a powerful marine split ability.

BO: Standard 1 Rax Fe with double gasses

Instead of making a starport this time, you make two faster additional barracks' and an engi bay at 6 mins (start +1 as soon as you can, but don't cancel anything). With the swapped factory rax, double produce hellions ( you don't have to constantly because you won't have enough income, I tend to have around 5-6 by the 10 minute mark) and make a techlab on the rax, with stim started and marauder production. With the other two raxxes, make a techlab and reactor. Start Combat Shields, and double pump marauders and marines. 

This force will also hold most early allins (except for 1 base bane bust), as the marauders will tank anything and your marines will dps everything and hellions have a summer bbq with the zerglings. Try to focus banes with marauders.

By the 9-10 minute mark, you should have 5-6 hellions, and a bunch of marauders and marines. Push out. Your hellions should have denied tower control most of the game, so he shouldn't have a clue this is coming. Once again, hit the third.

While you move out, start a starport, and 3rd CC, Engi bay (2), and armory. 

The things is, if you did this build right it SHOULD hit before any lair tech is out. But because I'm bad, I tend to hit around when their tech structure of choice is midway, but this works for me anyways because they still don't have mutas or fungal to properly deal with an on the spot splitting MMH force with stim and shields. You also need to stim very conservatively, because you don't have medivacs. Only stim when you ABSOLUTELY NEED TO, such as an engagement. Otherwise, try your best to stay away from stimming.

If you killed their third, hooray. Scan and see if you can kill the natural too. Otherwise, go home.

From here, switch the reactor factory with the techlab barracks, start tanks, medivacs, and lift your 3rd orbital and grab it. It plays out like a standard TvZ after this, but you should have a big advantage. This doesn't mean you should turtle either if you killed their third base, get a couple of more units and just kill them.

Pros: Strong timing, denies map control, MMH will destroy anything pre lair tech.

Cons: Requires hellions to stay alive so constantly pay attention to them, also requires strong split.

I've discovered that Plat and low Diamond Zergs alike have completely forgotten how to handle it. You probably wouldn't want to see replays of a lowly Plat Terran, so I'll just describe my experiences.

## Disclaimer

I completely acknowledge that 2rax pressure may not work for upper diamond and above. This is just something for fellow low level Terrans to ponder. 

## The build

12/14 rax into expand, with the expansion in the main. I don't all in, because I still enjoy macro play. I bring the two SCVs that build the raxes. I expand during the pressure. It's important that the expansion doesn't come up too late, or you're forfeiting any advantage you may have gained. I get double gases ASAP after I throw down the expansion. 

## Why it seems to work

### Zergs are lazy with overlords

It amazes me how many Zergs are no longer keeping an Overlord in a good position to spot bunkers. 

### Zergs forgot how to micro

In the last 10 games I've done this, only one Zerg even pulled drones. Even that Zerg, though, didn't know when to pull away. Overall, their early game micro is very sloppy. Mediocre stutter step micro goes very far. 


### Their first instinct is predictable. 

The Zerg will generally assume you've over-commited (make sure you don't!). Their natural response is to baneling bust you. This is why we grab double gas after the expand: We can have tanks out and ready before they bust us. 


### Zergs in general tend to go full retard once they see the first marine and SCV

And this is precisely why I'm doing this build. The goal isn't to kill the natural, the goal is to make the Zerg player physically uncomfortable by keeping them nervous/anxious/tense. They're used to sitting back and droning up without interruptions. I like to view this build as a reminder to Zerg that if they want to macro without interruptions, they can go play a custom.

In some games, the Z is so shaken by the early pressure that their midgame is absolutely terrible. You may find yourself wondering ""Where the heck is their army?"" when you push out. It's entirely possible they won't have one because they forgot how to transition out of dealing with early pressure.

1. A single seeker missle takes out all larva at a hatchery, so when your zerg friend is trying to remax you can instantly prevent an entire 19~ eggs from being formed. 

2. A-moving zerg units don't target auto-turrets when there is any other attacking unit nearby. IE, if you block off an area behind a mineral line (daybreak cannon rush style) and drop in between, the zerg player will have to manually attack the turrets to prevent the AI from going haywire.
     This can also be used during battle to either create a wall to run around or mess with Banelings that do not have building attack enabled either.

3. The auto-turret does more dps than an unstimmed +2 Marine, and has 3 times as much health with 1 more range as well. Use liberally.

4. This doesn't matter as much in a normal game but building armor reduces queen DPS vs turrets to less than 2 (150 health, you do the math on how imba that is). Also applies to 0/0 zerglings.

5. Seeker missles accellerate once they are within 1~2 range of the target, and so become inescapable. AKA if your zerg friend is trying to dodge you, there's nothing wrong with getting up super close. I can't tell you how many muta clusters I've killed by making him falsely think I was only going to fire from max range. 

6. The only units that ravens really suck vs TvZ are Ultralisks and Roaches. Thankfully as we covered before auto-turrets are good for harass if they don't go broodlord infestor.

7. Contrary to popular belief, you CAN cast raven spells while fungalled. Sadly this is mostly limited to dropping a desperation PDD, but I've saved countless raven lives by spamming turrets under them to prevent the farthest ones from being chained to death. 

8. After 4 in-game minutes a 15 hatch will have just finished 99% of games you play. This is the lifespan of a durable material auto-turret(use upgrades wisely!). 

I will also take this opportunity to answer any questions you may have about the raven.

Polt dominated at MLG Anaheim 2013, defeating NaNiwa, Dear, and HyuN on his way to winning first place and $10,000.  I was super super impressed with one of his TvZ build orders (that he used in g1 and g5 of the finals).  In this build, he showed off a new style of TvZ, getting every single map control unit that Terran has in order to safely secure a third base, lightly harass your opponent, and most importantly get great scouting information.

I, like I'm sure many of you, have had issues with scouting and defending early Zerg all-ins.  This build is very strong at taking every aspect of map control possible, and so I couldn't resist writing up this incredibly versatile way to play TvZ!

During this week while IEM was going on I came to the realization that since I never played in the HOTS beta that I would have to use my wings builds when I first started playing, and I just couldn't have that. 

So I spent all of my Saturday watching and re watching VODS and copying build orders from Sting, Dream, MVP, and YoDa the four Terran players that made it out of their groups.

Here are the notes that I took. 

http://imgur.com/a/CHtqn

Sorry if you can't read my handwriting, and yes I know there is no proper formatting or anything. If I stop counting supply its because there was likely an engagement of some kind that made supply associations a bit useless. 

I wasn't planning on sharing these notes but there were some really cool and *new* builds being put on display. Also these are just a few builds I picked to copy there are different variations of a lot of these builds that the same players used. 

Hope some people find these useful.

This is Bomber's TvZ build, as follows, ripped straight from [Day9's Daily #530.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkv-geeYe8A)

1.	10 Depot
2.	12 Rax, One Marine (Cut Marine Production)
3.	(Simultaneous) – 16 Orbital Command, 16 Gas # 1
4.	Command Center # 2 Started ASAP
5.	@ 50 Gas, Reactor onto Rax # 1. Resume Marine production once reactor finishes.
6.	@ 100 Gas, start Factory 
7.	After Factory, start Command Center # 3 ASAP
8.	@ 100 % Factory, hotswap Factory and Rax. Begin Tech Lab on Rax.
9.	Build 2 Hellions. At Hellions 80 – 90 %, Begin Gas # 2.
10.	 At around the 7:00 min mark, begin double engi bay and double gas on natural (#s 3 and 4) simultaneously. Once the engi bays finish, IMMEDIATELY begin +1/+1.
11.	 After sufficient hellion number has been reached (2 – 6), hotswap Rax # 1 and Factory # 1 again. Resume marine production, and begin tank and siege tech once you can afford it.
12.	 At around the 8:30 mark, begin Rax # 2 and Rax # 3 (one Reactor, one Tech Lab).
13.	 At +1/+1 50%, begin armory. 
14.	 Start Rax # 4 and Rax # 5 at roughly 9:00 (2 and 3 not even done yet).
15.	 At around this time, establish your third with marines, missile turrets, a bunker, and a tank.
16.	 Throughout this whole time, continue pumping marines, tanks, scvs, and depot wall offs. If spire is scanned, a few turrets are not a wasted investment.
17.	 Begin Stim research a little past 10:00.

18.	As soon as 2-2 begins researching, kick into over drive mode. SIMULTANEOUSLY: take two geysers at third, start Rax #s 6, 7, 8, start Factory (Tech Lab) # 2, Start Starport (Reactor) # 1, get combat shield, and research level one vehicle weapons at armory.

19.	 Once the two gasses at the third are done, cut scv production, but transfer around to even out the mining. 

20.	 Round out build with Rax #s 9 and 10. Final projected addons for Rax should be 7 reactors, and 3 Tech Labs.

21.	 At this point, marines should be produced 17 at a time, tanks two at a time, and medivacs two at a time.

22.	 Attack at 14 min. Protect tanks with marines, bring a handful of scvs to repair tanks, and use medivacs to drop marines once they are out of energy. Target expansions, but drops should take out tech buildings if possible, esp greater spire, baneling nest, and infestation pit.


I would like to point a few things out: although Day9 markets this as a 3 base all in, I have found that taking a 4th is easily possible behind this. Either way, I recommend you watch his daily on it. 

The weaknesses to this build are quite obvious: a good zerg player will make establishing your third a nightmare, your nonexistent harass of him will let him expand and creep spread all he wants for 14 minutes. This build is extremely reliant on the Zerg Player sticking to the current meta (mass expand, turtle to hive tech). Don't expect it to work to a massive attack early on, although your early tanks should stop any baneling busts. But if you get roach dropped before your production kicks in, just gracefully GG out.

gl hf everybody!

(WARNING: A long post xD),ProbablyAccidentally,46,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1all7a/just_a_friendly_reminder_dont_worry_so_much/,"I'm a fairly new member to ATT. I've been posting here and there, but I've definitely gained a lot of insight and knowledge, not to mention help from the community and all the love and support it provides. So today, I've decided to give a little encouragement to all the Terrans out there by sharing a little story about my girlfriend.

She started playing WoL about a year ago when I first met her, because she seemed interested in it and I offered to let her play on my laptop once. Since then, she's been absolutely hooked, playing for hours and hours each day. She grinds out ladders not to get better, but BECAUSE IT'S FUN. Does she know any builds? Nope. Does she care? not at all. Expo at optimal times? micro? macro? benchmarks? 50 scvs? nope nope nope nope nope. She simply plays because it's fun. Win or lose. She's had 0 RTS experience, and yet it's so fun to her. She grabs rich minerals because ""oooh it's so pretty"" and she constantly builds supply depots, way past 200 supply, because she ""likes building them."" Xel'Naga towers? ""pretty towers."" She doesn't watch streams, she doesn't look up strategies and discussions, she has no idea what imba and OP mean, SHE JUST PLAYS.

What I'm trying to say is this. A lot of times we stress over a lot of things, which prevents us from enjoying the game. ATT is freaking awesome because of all the discussion and the members' willingness to help each other improve. Sometimes, though, you can tell that some of us are just really anxious and nervous about the multiplayer aspect, particularly losing, and we want to learn the game inside and out before we even hit that 'Find Match' button. You don't have to! Just go out and play, and you'll learn all that on your own! I know how frustrating it gets to lose, but when you start playing a lot, you'll start having fun, you'll start taking losses as chances to learn, and you'll improve a shit ton. So just go out there and play. You absolutely have to play in order to improve... and you also absolutely have to play to begin with, in order to enjoy it!

With HotS out, the game is getting even more exciting. I'm having fun learning new units, and my girlfriend is having a blast. If we can learn to enjoy playing, then trust me you will climb that ladder eventually. You can always reach out to the community for help or questions.

My gf texted me last night (at 5 freaking AM) while I was sleeping. She said that she's going to sleep, that she misses me, and that she won a lot on sc2 and finally reached gold. I'm so proud of her. And I'm proud of everyone here too. We can do it guys. Now let's go kick some alien ass on ladder.

Open up a custom game vs ai and practice a basic build and hit 10 minute benchmarks like 50 scv's. Practice efficient scouting: check for gas, check for expansions with a later scout, use scans liberally. 

*Plat-Diamond:* Open up a custom game and practice maxing by 14 minutes on a decent unit composition. Learn to use positional hotkeys on at least your first 3 bases. It takes some getting used to, but neglecting these will hurt you in the long term. Have 2-3 army hotkeys minimum. Playing custom games like darglein's micro trainer can help you improve your apm/multitaking.


**TvP:**
Below diamond, don't even bother with ghosts. Practice scouting effectively and responding with the appropriate defense. Don't be afraid to scan and check for tech/expos. Hit the [10 minute push](http://www.gosubuilds.com/terran-build-orders-2/terran-vs-protoss/1rax-fe-into-medivacs/) perfectly and collect your wins. Practice basic stutter step in darglein's micro trainer. 

Diamond+: Get the 10 minute push down perfectly. Practice ghost control in darglein's micro trainer. Learn to be spot on with upgrades or you might end up having 1/1 or worse when toss comes with his 3/3 push. Drop liberally, but make them have purpose. 


**TvZ:**
Below diamond:
Practice the [bomber build](http://day9.tv/d/Day9/day9-daily-530/) taught in a day9 daily. It's a solid way to max by the 14/15 minute mark. Your mechanics and macro needs to develop more before you try builds like hellion banshee. If you can do the build decently without macro slip ups, you will easily dominate any zerg up to masters.

Diamond+:Bomber build is still great. If you choose to do builds like hellion banshee make sure that you control units effectively and continue expanding/producing in the background. Too much focus on micro will cause you to lose the game. Not enough focus on micro will cause you to lose the game. Be careful using higher level builds that are multi tasking intensive.


**TvT:**
Below diamond:
Play a safe defensive style. Scout for gas and expansions. Use scans liberally. The TvP 10 minute push will win you most games if executed properly. Learn good missile turret placements.

Diamond+:
Don't be over eager to end the game. Scout well (gas/expos) and be one step ahead of your opponent. Make sure to leave marines at his third and along attack paths he can take. Liberally use missile turrets and sensor towers. A safe defensive style with good information gathering is the best way to win TvT. The actual build you open with is stylistic, and I leave that up to you.

**TLDR** Practice using positional hotkeys and maxing by 14 minutes in a custom game. Then, practice micro and multitasking using darglein's micro trainer. Don't bother with fancy builds like hellion banshee under diamond.

Here's the comment:

&gt;For using Snipe, select it and then click near the middle of their army on the minimap. It'll automatically hit the closest biological target to where you clicked, and as long as you didn't click near the front (where the zealots will usually be) it will hit HTs the majority of the time. This is an easy way to Snipe HTs when they're mixed in with the rest of the army and you're having difficulty seeing/clicking them.

Just to add to this, you can also hold shift while sniping on the minimap for even faster sniping.

Tanks in TvZ are gotten to deal with infestors and banelings so that your marines can be protected. However, tanks only ever get a few volleys off and are almost never cost efficient. Tanks have some notable disadvantages and I feel like they should almost entirely be skipped. 

Before I further expand on why I feel that tanks are bad (generally) in TvZ, let me state when I feel they are of use. Tanks can be useful against baneling allins or heavy baneling usage. Tanks allow for good positional play to pressure or attack the zerg with. And, tanks do a good job of zoning infestors away from your marines so that you can spread them and maximize their efficiency.

But the reality of TvZ is that tanks are often overrun by zerglings in the mid game and fair *horribly* against ultralisks and brood lords in the late game. Tanks in the midgame can easily be replaced by marauders and an increased medivac count, similar to how Marineking has been playing recently. With good micro, an appropriate marauder count, and a fleet of medivacs, pure bio becomes way more cost efficient than marine/tank. 

The advantages are obvious. You don't have to upgrade your tanks (since you aren't making any, of course) and so you can go double engineering bay every game and get an upgrade lead. No tanks allows you to get more medivacs, which makes your bio really cost efficient. You're more mobile and are able to pressure the zerg without fear of getting caught unsieged. Lastly, the late game broodlord or ultralisk transition is no longer scary. Broodlords can be easily countered by a switch to vikings, exactly as you would with tanks. Tanks are very bad against ultralisks because of the inability of your tanks to splash them. The fact that marauders are already out makes that transition very simple to deal with.

I've felt this for a few weeks now, ever since we all had to reconsider our TvZ. If you disagree, don't downvote. Reply and make a good counterargument.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,icon-rank-masters,True,t3_wxyex,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/wxyex/tanks_in_tvz/,

This isn't an exciting new build or a killer bit of micro, but I hope it will help a little bit without having to turn anyone into Flash to accomplish it.

As time has gone on Zerg has gotten pretty good at defending Reapers, so I'm quite happy to open up with a couple of Marines.  But what to do with them?  Go Overlord hunting, of course!

Zergs still expect Reapers, and so they get pretty careless.  If you kill an Overlord it's a pretty big deal, and will set the Zerg back a good 30 seconds or so (especially important vs all-ins) as well as messing up their build order and denying scouting.  If you kill 2, and you have a solid build behind it, the Zerg is left miles behind just a couple of minutes into the game.

To do this you will need 2 Marines after your Barracks finishes.

Below is a rough guide of some ladder maps where I frequently kill off their first Overlord -- and sometimes their second too.

[Disclaimer: in my limited experience, lower league Zergs are much worse at sending their Overlords on these paths and so you're less likely to get the kills.  You'll have to test the Zergs you play against yourself.]

**Akilon Wastes**

Success rate on first Overlord: 90%+

Success rate on second Overlord: ~25%

Normal Overlord paths: http://i.imgur.com/rmQNHB0.jpg

As the figures suggest this is the best map to go hunting on.  There are two paths that nearly every single Zerg uses, and both of them provide an easy kill.

The first task is to find out which route he's going.  I do this by sending my scouting SCV (after the Barracks completes) on a slight detour to check for the non-natural-bound Overlord.  If it's there, my Marines will go kill it, if not, the Marines will head to kill the one heading for the natural.

In the case of the natural you'll need to position one Marine to cover whatever high ground it's heading towards and one to cover the low ground.  In the case of the other path you might need to rally the second Marine to the natural, or send one to each side of the void just outside it and the third.

Most Zergs will go for the natural first.  If they do, and you kill it off relatively quickly, you have a very good chance of killing the second Overlord too.

**Derelict Watcher**

Success rate on first Overlord: 90%+

Success rate on second Overlord: 5-10%

Normal Overlord paths: http://i.imgur.com/2l4ZirN.jpg

The first Overlord will almost always be sent to the natural here.  Again, I send my SCV (after Barracks to do a quick runby of the pathway towards it that I've marked.  This allows me to rally my Marines right into its path.  If it isn't there it will either be on the second path or going over the third instead.

I will usually send my first Marine to scout the third, and the second to check the second path.  You should be able to kill it if it goes either way.

If you kill it quickly as it heads to your natural you can head over to the void that the other Overlord should pass over.  By putting one Marine on each side (or finding it nearby) you can sometimes get a bonus kill.

**Newkirk Redevelopment Precinct**

Success rate on first Overlord: ~10%

Success rate on second Overlord: ~1%

Normal Overlord paths: http://i.imgur.com/CDJj9xo.jpg

This is a tricky one, since they usually send their first Overlord straight to your main, but it can still be done depending on what they do with it.

I'll send my scouting SCV (after Barracks) to check the path towards the natural, just to make sure it isn't there (if I haven't seen it in my main already).  If it is going that way it's an easy kill.

If it's heading to your main you'll want to send your first Marine to the expansion with the rocks, and then rally your second into your main.  If the Overlord is too far north, or too slow to react, you can pin it and kill it before it gets into dead space.

**Star Station**

Success rate on first Overlord: ~5%

Success rate on second Overlord: ~0%

Normal Overlord paths: http://i.imgur.com/e3v3fwz.jpg

There's really only one direction the first Overlord goes here, so it's very predictible.  Personally I almost never kill it because I go for a 12 Barracks in my main.  However, even at that I do a lot of damage to it, which allows me to kill it easier later on when it's trying to scout.

You can get this kill every time if you're willing to make some small sacrafices yourself (which I will likely start doing in the future).  For example, I once saw the Russian pro player Happy build his Barracks just outside his natural, I think at 11 supply, and he got the kill from that.

**Other Maps**

The other maps are difficult because they're either 4 player or small enough to get somewhere safe before the Marines can do their work.  But there's no doubt some damage you can do if you experiment a bit.  For example, on Neo Planet you might be able to get the Overlord at your natural with a Barracks lift.

Skip to 41:00 to watch it in action.

This build gives you a max marine/tank/medivac army with +2/+2 (bio), +1 attack (vehicle weapons), stim, and combat shields at 14:00. I immediately copied this build to my notebook, and thought others might enjoy it.


* 12 Barracks
* 17 Orbital, Gas #1
* 3:24 CC
* 3:40 Depot
* 3:57 Reactor on Rax (no marines produced)
* 4:48 Factory, 2x Marine
* 5:01 CC
* 5:10 Upgrade Nat. Expo to Orbital

* 6:04 Depot
* 6:21 Gas #2
* @2-4 Hellions Swap factory and begin marine/tank production
* 6:42 Upgrade 3rd CC to Orbital
* 7:00 Gas #3

* 12:50 Begin push 

Notes: This build is very difficult to execute correctly, and good scouting/reacting is required to avoid dieing to early aggression.  However, this will crush opponents who try to tech up on 3 bases.  In my experience, if I live to 14:00 without having taken serious damage, the game is mine.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,1353663019.0,,,True,t3_13nscl,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/13nscl/bombers_incredible_tvz_build_vs_stephano_lonestar/,

I can play Zerg at a diamond level and protoss around Plat but Terran I can't even play at a silver level. Every game I play ends with one simple mistake and me getting obliterated by my much worse opponent. For example, I held off a zerg's roach ling rush off one and macroed up a huge tank, marine, maurader(he was roach heavy), medivac army with 2/2 to end the game. I didn't think to scan and a ton of roaches popped up on top of my tanks and it was over. 


I've always wanted to play Terran because it seems like such a fun micro oriented race and also its a challenge but it seems like there are a million different tiny mistakes to make where you just lose. Unsieged tanks, forgetting turrets etc. I think it would take me hundreds of games before I could start remembering everything and not just work all game just to lose off a simple mistake.

 I don't agree, I don't think you'll get much further than platinum, and further more I think that most Platinum players could have almost as good macro as Bomber, if that was the _only_ thing they focused on. Well, rather than babble back and forth, let's just put this to the test and that's where I need your help ATT. The question is, how close to ideal (Bomber) can players from different leages get, if _all_ they focus on is Macro? Well to test this out we need players from every league.

I need 3 Volunteers, 

* 1 from Gold ([CannedBeef](http://www.reddit.com/user/CannedBeef) is our first volunteer, [delta4zero](http://www.reddit.com/user/delta4zero) is our second.)
* 1 from Platinum ([Shalashaka1022](http://www.reddit.com/user/Shalashaka1022) is our first volunteer)
* 1 from Master league ([NoseKnowsAll](http://www.reddit.com/user/NoseKnowsAll) is our first volunteer) 

I will be doing this at Diamond league level. Obviously if more people want to try it out, you are welcome, as more data is always nice. 

**THE EXPERIMENT**

So I have been provided with a Bomber replay from [yomcool](http://www.reddit.com/u/yomcool) where he takes almost no economical damage. 

[REPLAY HERE](http://drop.sc/187497)

The goal of the test subjects is then to as best as possible match the build, and thus the macro, of Bomber. To achieve this goal they are given 5 games of ""trying"" before the final game. 

The final game should be played on Daybreak LE against a very easy AI. The AI should not bother you, in worst case just rally units to the middle of the map and they should deal with anything. 

We will compare the performance of the test subjects at the 5, 10 and 15 minute mark. To fairly compare it against Bomber, any units Bomber looses will be added to his count. 

I'll update this thread with any data that you add. 

So, does this sound interesting? Want to find out how bad your macro really is? Then please take part in the Great Macro Experiment!

**THE BUILD**

Rather than post a really long, tedious build here, I'll just link to a [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/dRVWPTA8)

A short description for someone familiar with Terran builds is that it's a 1 depot 1 rax expand, 2 more rax before taking only 1 gas. Take 2nd gas at 6 minutes and start your factory and engineering bay as soon as you have 100 gas. Get your third gas at 8 minutes, add reactors and techlabs at 8:40 and start your third asap afterwards. Then add 2 more rax, add second engi bay and armory when +1 attack is finished and then just keep building units/scvs until about 12-13 minutes, then you add Ghost academy and 3 more rax.

**THE RESULTS**

* Gold -  [CannedBeefs replay](http://drop.sc/298109)
* Platinum - [Shalashaka's replay](http://drop.sc/298122)
* Diamond - [Fjafjans replay](http://drop.sc/298089)
* Master League - [NoseKnowsAll's replay](http://drop.sc/298040)

**TL,DR; How good is the macro of lower league players if _all_ they focus on is macro compared to Bomber? Let's try it out.**

EDIT: whoops, posted this before I got the replay -_- Still, if you are interested I guess you can post. 

EDIT2: Replay posted, will look at it now and post build order. 

EDIT3: Forgot to clarify! Play games either vs no one at all, or an Easy AI. You should not have to worry about ANYTHING except Macro, with macro defined as building as much stuff as quickly as possible.

Then I realized I don't have to play ""gsl viable"" builds to win in patinum lol.

Recently I have started playing much, much more aggressive, often going 11/11 or viking/raven/banshee vs zerg, 1-1-1 vs toss or this marauder expand thingy (kinda came up with that one messing around), and weird 1 base shit vs terran. 

 I often pull scvs, lift my buildings and all in super hard when I am significantly behind.  

I build bunkers in my opponents base while pushing with bio.

I emp orbital commands

I use the auto repair function when i play skyterran or mech.

I'm sick of toss and zerg getting badass lategame armies.

I play to win.

I get a ton of fucking BM and whining, about 3/4 games, players seem to get really butt hurt when they play someone who doesn't use ""metagame"" or 'standard builds.  I mean what the fuck do they want from me? let them expand uncontrollably and attack me with mothership/templar/colossus or corrupter/BL/infestor?

Sorry about my whining, just needed to vent, been winning tonight, been BM'ed almost every game.

So I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome our 300+ new Hero Terrans!  It's great to have you here, and I hope that you grow to love this community as much as we do.  Once we hit 1000 members I'll make another mod post to update everyone on what they can expect from us in the near future (we're still working on that tournament, guys!).

Finally, I'd like to officially thank MrGordonFreemanJr for making that post in /r/starcraft.  They brought in a combined 1000+ new members across the three communities, and we're incredibly grateful.

I would like to share the replay with you because I know this is a place where it can be appreciated, and I am too excited from the game to fall asleep :D  Also, by no means is this great play or a calculated, refined response to the scenario; it is a 90 minute scrappy game with mistakes from both sides fueled by a refusal to lose.  

Game is master level (both players ~800 points [not for long!])

Context:  My opponent pressures early so I play very safe, with the intention of maintaining my advantage into the later stages of the mid-game.  However, my opponent macros up a decent colossus count, and my attempts at follow up aggression are well handled (I really botch an attack at his 3rd, when it looks like I am about to win).  After he counters, things stop looking so standard; I respond with many drops.  The game goes crazy from here and there is a very tense build up where I am always on the brink of defeat.

Fun facts about this game:

Workers Killed: SpaceWhales(123) / ProtossHooker(113)

Final Units Lost: SpaceWhales(805/$66,749) / ProtossHooker(409/$52,700)

1rax FE, depot walloff, cc, 2 more rax, double gas, techlab, stim, double reactor, factory, medivacs and upgrades and 3rd.

Basically the same as all other TvPs.  So how is he getting 100+ supply by 9 minutes?  

* His depot walloff =&gt; he has constant marine production =&gt; he doesn't need a bunker to deal with the first zealot/stalker =&gt; he can get his 2rax and double gas earlier.  Skipping this bunker means he kick starts all upgrades and the rest of his play around 10ish seconds earlier than if he hadn't skipped the bunker ([Citation Needed] but you get the point).  
* He starts 2 reactors on his barracks and he does it BEFORE his factory.  This means that he can start serious marine production VERY quickly, and he has these marines for the fight.

Ok that makes sense.  So why is this actually not as good as everyone here thinks it is?

* Starting the CC after 2nd depot =&gt; 2 less SCVs than you would otherwise have had.  You have a slightly smaller economy than normal 1rax FE.  He kickstarts his upgrades and rest of his play sooner, but does it at the cost of several SCVs.
* If an early 1 base allin comes (read: 4gate) like what Sase and Grubby have shown capable of doing, he will insta-lose because his bunker is later than normal to take advantage of no protoss players doing this anymore.
* His reactors early means HE CAN'T MAKE ANY MARINES UNTIL THOSE THINGS FINISH.  Again, allins (like Naniwas immortal push or a 3gate void) would walk all over him.
* His reactors early means his factory is 100 gas later.  This means his push is around 30seconds later.  Thus, even though he gets the food supply and has stim and lots of marines pretty early - HIS ACTUAL PUSH (which is timed with the medivacs popping, just like all TvP pushes) COMES 30 SECONDS LATER.  Yes, it hits with more punch than earlier factory builds, but notice how every single game he did it vs normal collo timings, his opponent already had their first collo done and their second half-way done.

Just had to say this now before you guys get all out-of-hand.  He's doing things in a different order than what other people have been doing recently, but it's more or less the same.  Personally, I don't like his way because to me the cons outway the pros.  

In other news, his midgame dropship control is fucking sick.  He controls 3 armies in different locations on the map like it's no problem at all.  I love how he delays ghosts for a while in favor of committing more with huge amounts of multipronged MMM play in dropships.  Also, I got him to sign my starcraft box.

I was a former Terran Masters player. I stopped playing around July of last year. Basically I got burned out from too much SC2. Laddering, watching streams, /r/starcraft, etc. 

Anyways I picked up the game again and thought I'd share my experience after 3 days back. 

I had a LOT of rust the first day. What was surprising is my muscle memory remembered all of my hotkeys. I forgot my builds and my macro's pretty horrible now. I did my placement matches and landed in Silver. 

About 50 matches later I'm now in high platinum. 

The game plays very differently vs zerg now. Before it was zerg,muta,banelings. Now it seems they go mass zerglings / infestors or zergling / roach / infestors.  

I'm opening with the popular gasless fast expand into hellions / banshees. Amazing opener. The hardest part is when the zerg gets really aggressive before my banshee comes out. 

TvP feels pretty much the same as before. Quite a boring an predictable match up. I saw some videos Byun goes for a dual prong attack with hellions and marines that I'm looking forward to trying out.  

TvT. Is going mech still viable? When I stopped playing I remember blue flame hellions were all the rage. This was always my weakest matchup and I was able to succeed by playing MKP bio style. Now I'm in platinum I'm going to take the time to learn more standard styles with tanks and banshees.

I started watching some pros play, the triple orbital's new to me and I'm looking forward to incorporating it into my play. 

I kinda like how Terran's ""underpowered."" I love TvZ's and look forward to more of them as I move up. 

I definitely like the map pool selection now. Looks like they finally got rid of metalopolis and xel naga. Also I like how a lot of the maps are designed for 1v1 with set spawn locations. 

Downloading a lot of Taeja replays!

Anyways that's all. I did think about a race switch before I came back, but I realized why I love Terran

- Drop play
- Micro intensive. I love shutter stepping with rines and banshees
- Highest skill cap level to get ""good"" with
- I hate watching ZvZ and PvP, I can't imagine playing those matches.

Lets make it even harder in HotS...,Antares_,42,10,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/108xot/terran_struggles_late_game_in_wol_lets_make_it/,"Ok, so I don't see a logic in what Blizzard says and what they do. Not long ago, David Kim admitted that Terran has very strong early and mid-game, but struggles in early late game and sometimes end game. What they did in HotS? They buffed Zerg and Protoss late game a lot, while Terrans get even more powerful in early and mid game.

Ok, they buffed BCs, but still they are very hard to transition into, just like Carriers and thus not very viable before 30 minute mark. 

Especially in TvZ, how is Terran now supposed to win against late game Zerg composition, with Ultras (+burrow charge), Blinding Cloud + Fungal combo, or even speed Hydras? And since they get Swarm Host it's going to be even harder to brake them mid game.

TvP? It was hard enough to win while unharrased, now they get Entombed and much easier transition into Carriers. You can no longer go with a mid-game timing, because the second you leave your base, Oracles will reduce your mineral income to 0 and unless you kill Protoss, you die to a counterattack. You'd have to put Turrets around every mineral line, but it's ~800-1000 Minerals to get fully protected on 2 bases, depending on the map. 1000 Minerals is 20 Marines/10 Marauders. If you lose that much army, you can't go with a timing either. 

After watching some streams, I really agree that David Kim should get raped with a Tyre Iron, so maybe he'll pull himself together and do something good for the balance. Also, what is even more stupid, the only top tier Terrans who got invite are ForGG, DeMu and Illusion.

The screen shot is from one of my games where I went mech yesterday before I realized the changes had been implemented.  You can see that I have 24 damage with an extra + 3 vs. light from my +3 vehicle attack upgrades.

Each upgrade gives +2 damage with a bonus +1 vs. light, regardless of whether you get the blue flame upgrade or not.

I made a post about this in /r/starcraft yesterday asking if people thought this was a bug or intended with the new change....  for some reason people felt the need to downvote it.

I'd like to bring it up and ask the same kind of question to ATT.

Do you think this is a bug or intended?  

It doesn't make a huge difference one way or the other... but I find it very strange.   You have a unit that has no bonus damage to light (without blue flame), but if you give it a regular attack upgrade, it now gets bonus damage to light.

It's clearly a carry over of how the upgrades worked before this change, and it might be intentional, but I don't know.   

The only thing I can think it would really have any significant/noticeable impact on is that with things as they are, a hellbat without blue flame that has +1 vehicle attack can still 2 shot a drone (42 damage vs. 41 health with 1 hp being healing) whereas without this bonus damage to light it would still take 3 shots to kill a full health drone (1 hp regens) with +1 vehicle attack against no armor upgrades.

Edit:  It also makes a difference in being able to 2 shot a probe that has +1 armor or +2 armor (no shield upgrades), if you have +1 vehicle weapons.

If I had to guess, it's because he got tired of losing to all of the different zerg all ins that are ruining the winrates of terrans like Innovation and Flash. This build completely demolished Hydra's roach bane all in and allowed flash to counter attack and win the game instantly and you (should) have enough units to deal with 1/1 roach timings.

* 3rd cc when you can afford (flash timing at 11:30)

Deviations:

Make marauders from tech lab rax if roaches

If zerg is all in with roach bane, skip 3rd gas and make bunks.

**My thoughts**

This build is much less forgiving than 3 cc builds vs standard zerg play. If you micro badly - you will lose your army cost inefficiently and not have the better economy from 3cc builds to make up for it. Also, if you are not on top of your production cycles - you can still lose a bunch to all ins and not have the triple scv/mule production to help you come back.

However, this builds gives you something that 3cc cannot - a safe way to play standard TvZ where your success is only limited by your ability to do multiprong attacks and macro behind it. You get quick access to widowmine + bio drops that innovation loves to do and you can really stretch out a zerg, but it's just as important to make sure that you are expanding on time and keeping up with upgrades.

So if you're losing a lot with 3cc - try this build out and enjoy learning a new style :).

I mech against P and Z, and do a Mid game harass into Bio/Tank in TvT.  I may do a decision flow chart for these if they are well received, but its already up in my head so I'd only make that if people would want to look at it.

It seems like it's common for non-Terran players to talk condescendingly, but it also seems to me like there's a lot of pro players who play Terran, and really well at that. I'm pretty sure that in the case of my last opponent, it was just the product of a ragequit. But he still took the time to say it.

This build seems to be designed to apply an early pressure on a zerg who go for 6 queens and 3 hatchs without gas. I tried to use it and it worked pretty well in some situations.

But first you need to scout your oppponent and to be sure that he doesn't go for a fast speedgling or a roach/ling all-in! So you can scout him after he started his first hatch to see  if he takes one gas, then scout him again or scan around 5 min to see if he goes for a double gas (probably a roach all-in or fast tech) or a 3rd hatch.

If he doesn't go for a fast gas, here the build (it's pretty easy):

CC first or fast CC after your first barrack.

Add 2 barracks (to be on 3 racks).

Take 2 gas

At 25 gas go for a tech lab on one of your racks

At 100 gas go for combat shield on this tech lab.

Keep producing scv and marines/marauders, when the combat shield is almost done, go put some pressure at the zerg's 3rd. If he isnt ready he can lose it, and if he doesn't take a 3rd you can force as many units as possible until go back to your base.

The goal of this build is to force the zerg to build units or even kill his 3rd if he isn't ready.

After that build you can transition into 1 EB, fast medivacs, fast 3rd, siege tank, add 2 racks and go for a more normal game.

If the zerg go for a fast speedgling, you can go for hellions/banshee or fast siege tank. If you see him going for a roach/banelings all-in, try to go for a fast siege tank and to make some bunkers at your b2 and b1.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,,True,t3_x4vlf,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/x4vlf/slayerss_combat_shield_build/,

**When doing a gasless 1rax FE in TvP, get Combat Shields instead of Stim first.**

With the prevalence of Oracle openers, this basically gives you the opportunity to counter attack and actually tank enough damage from the planetary nexus to still do game ending economic damage.  

Basically all you have to do is get the engibay for two turrets (one per mineral line) to defend, while attacking just before your combat shields finishes with as many marines as you have.  An Oracle expanding player is going to be super low on units because they're trying to tech up like crazy to get out the necessary AOE to deal with medivac timings, and then you just walk up the ramp to their natural, kill some units and laugh as combat shields makes your marines near invulnerable to the few zealots, stalkers they may have running around.

Some notes:

* If you know your opponent is not getting oracles, then feel free to get stim first instead.  This attack is more of a coinflip vs standard play than an ez win vs oracles.
* Stalkers, mothership cores, and planetary nexi each take an extra shot to kill a marine with combat shields than they do one without combat shields.
* You WILL most likely lose all of your marines in the push eventually (not before doing lots of eco damage), so don't forget to get out the factory and starport tech/stim/upgrades and continue macroing while you're doing the damage.

 I will try to get to all of you, but I have around 50 people that have asked for coaching. I will try my best. For now, I will cease request for new students (I have alot of people already added me, since this thread is dying down, but I will answer any questions that you have in this thread to the best of my abilities about terran).

Those are skypes.

Hello everyone, my moniker is Slur, and I am a mid masters (~800-900 pt level) Terran.

I have been playing starcraft for around 1 year now, and have been playing Terran since January. 

I had a few jams, the main one in low/mid diamond. I stayed there for almost a whole season, and would never have made it out of my permenant slump (I had around 3 full pages in match history of losses, with little wins. I was on massive tilt.

I would never have gotten out of that tilt and into masters if it werent for two amazing people. They coached me for hours and taught me everything I needed to know. I owe them my masters promotion.

I want to pay back the community, as he said. I want to coach people and help them improve. I only have one student, but I feel as if I could coach well. It will also improve my play.

A few things beforehand, some rules for my coaching.

* My coaching is FREE 

* You should listen to me. I think I know what I'm talking about. I do not know alot, but if you are under diamond, chances are I have a bit more experience/game sense, and micro/macro. 

I'm not good with wording, but here is an example:
You go on skype, and you ask a question about a certain style. I give my opinions on it, and ask you to work with ONE build that will strengthen your mechanics substantially, and help with macro/terran in general. You ignore my advice, and continue to do whatever you wish, and say I am wrong, etc. 

* I do not know everything. I am not good, merely a masters player, but I am pretty sure I will know more then the majority of Diamond/lower players.

* My styles are NOT all ins. I do not like all in/cheese and feel you should never do them if you want to improve. For improving you should do the 1 build I give you for each match up, and focus on macro. It doesn't matter if you lose, as long as you learn.

* I play extremely macro-heavy with smart aggression. 

Anyways, here's the info you'll need:

I am EST time zone, I am normally on from 11 am to 10 pm , but I am starting school soon.


**Slur.918** is my Game/Code

**Slur.660** is my EU game/code 

**MGInfinite.933** is my KR game/code

I will almost always be on NA. I do not like EU for practice because they do alot of cheese on ladder.

The main way to contact me for coaching, replays, etc:

**SKYPE - ColonelSlur**
This is how we will talk, communicate, etc. I will voice chat with you, you can send replays over skype or upload them to drop.sc and I will watch them with you. You can msg me on skype anytime and I will respond asap (on DnD most of the time)

**REDDIT - ColonelSlur**

You can PM me here anytime and I can answer questions.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have practice partners beforehand, or we will both be wasting time looking for people for you to practice with. I recommend :

**Diamond+ Practice** - This is an SC2 IN GAME CHANNEL that Diamond+ can join, ask questions, and say something like ""looking for 1v1 mid diamond"" and have the ~40 people in there to answer you.

**http://www.reddit.com/r/sc2partners/** - This is a VERY good subreddit. You just make a post, for people AROUND AND ABOVE your skill level ( you should always be practicing with poeple slightly better then you , aka mid plat -&gt; high plat. low diamond -&gt; mid/high diamond. high diamond -&gt; mid masters. )

Please please PLEASE keep in mind that I am in no way good. I am only mid masters, there ARE people that know 100000x more then me, but I know a fair amount, so please listen. 

I WILL ONLY COACH PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE GENUINE DESIRE TO IMPROVE. Please do not give up. You can do it , and you have to understand, while there are slumps and tilts and frustration, you just need to set those aside and improve. People will help you. I will help you. We all know terran is a bit funky atm, but you can NOT give up or cry. Remember, there are people that improve very much as terran. All match ups are more or less balanced (in mid masters).

The match ups are all depended on the Terran. If you can micro/macro, you will win. if you can't, you will lose.

Terran is the most powerful race. Toss/zerg have very little of a skill cap. Toss can just a move/storm, and zerg can just a move, fungal. Terran can a move/stim and micro to SO MUCH of an extent. Your micro is either if you lose, win, or destroy. If you are good, you will win. 

In my observations, Terran is a bit hard in HIGH PLAT/LOW DIAMOND and SILVER. Those two places are where terrans are lacking and the toss/zerg have been able to find a way to win.

AKA toss learns colossi/storm but terran does not have ghost control at that moment.

zergs know how to fungal effectively but terrans do not know focus fire/dropping.

Lastly, I do not stream, simply because no one would watch, but here are some VERY good streams to watch, to improve:

http://www.twitch.tv/xenocidersc2 : amazing analysis and commentary, knows how to play.

http://www.twitch.tv/pepsi29 : High masters terran, with commentary and tips that will help you alot.

http://www.twitch.tv/nathanias : very fun player while teaching you how to play

http://www.twitch.tv/quanticillusion : very good terran who commentates occasionally and has interesting styles

http://www.twitch.tv/ispyre : commentates and is a really good macro player

http://www.twitch.tv/mindfeast123 : very high masters terran player who commentats. 

http://www.twitch.tv/isxl : me streaming my lessons, so my studewnts can watch the vods!

**TL;DR : Mid masters terran will help/coach/become a mentor to anyone, just add me on skype/sc2 and msg me. Will only coach if you have the genuine desire to improve and will not give up on terran.**

Thank you,

Slur

1343385917.0,29,self.AllThingsTerran,x8psp,A plea to ATT redditors and mods.,Rockztar,44,15,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/x8psp/a_plea_to_att_redditors_and_mods/,"Hey, this doesn't actually fit into the ATT guidelines in itself, but I don't know where else to post it, so I'm just gonna go ahead.
What I'm writing is going to sound a bit harsh, but just bear with me.

I've noticed a ton of of threads in this subreddit with vague, useless descriptions of what a player is having a problem with. 
This would be okay, if there was a replay showing the problem, but a lot of people can't even be bothered to upload a replay, when asking for help.

Examples I just took from the ATT front page right now:

http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/x5leu/tvz_vs_aggressive_2_base_lingbling_runbys/ (OP literally says he fights nothing but this. Shouldn't be too much work to find a replay, if you really want to fix it.)

http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/x4ujt/how_do_i_get_back_into_biobiomech/ (If we can't see how you play, we won't be able to tell you, if it's your micro  or whatever the problem is)

http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/x86ov/adding_barracks/ (absolutely no information given here. Given the fact that there are so many styles to play, if it's 1-5 bases he's talking about, which matchups specifically(in case he's meching in some))

http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/x8jgh/most_important_things_to_work_on_as_a_platinum/ (This one speaks for itself)

http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/x81ct/how_do_you_deal_with_mass_dt_harrassment/ (again, another pretty useless description blah, blah blah)

I know it seems harsh, when I call it useless, but it's only because I want to help. I used to post here quite a bit, and put a ton of effort(like writing freaking novels to help out people without gaining more than a few upvotes, just because I want to help).


If you really want to improve, you don't fight ignorance with ignorance, as in you don't fix a problem by using the wrong solution.
There's so much misinformation in the threads with replays already that it certainly doesn't help, if we can't specifically see, if OP even has a clue what his problem actually is. For example it could be that the guy stating he has bad micro actually has decent micro, but has terrible decision making, but we just can't see it because there's no replay.

So I would implore mods to put an effort into making sure that every thread is of a proper caliber, so that we can stop the spread of misinformation, and essentially get rid of all these threads full of b*llshit quite frankly.

Hopefully ATT takes this as constructive criticism and not a rant.

 remaining cool (somewhat), 

sticking to your build (for the most part),

Of course the problem with making such a system would be shifting meta game strategies and maybe differences in playstyles but I am confident there are enough basics embedded in the game that this can be constructed and be very useful. 

Me being only Platinum league, I am not entirely qualified to fabricate the entire system simply due to lack of skill and knowledge. I was hoping we as a subreddit could pitch in and create a very well thought out plan for new and old players to get better at Starcraft.

Here is the knowledge map for Khan Academy if you haven't seen it:

So if I could offer some advice for any upcoming players: Dont watch your units die. 

To expand, most micro is not necessary at all. The only time I find myself needing to micro is:

&gt;to get out of storm

&gt;to avoid fungal

&gt;to avoid banelings

&gt;early game all-ins

&gt;vikings

A battle between roaches and marines is going to end either way. You should be building. 

So I guess I can suggest at higher leagues, micro is effective, but watching your units die isnt. That 5 seconds it takes for your units to be finished off can be spent expanding/building/etc... If you have 20 engagements in a game thats almost 2 minutes of not doing anything macro. 

 I know this is pretty common knowledge; but I told myself I wasnt watching my units die. I was. Ive made an effort to not do that and it caused me to beat builds that were otherwise dominating me. It has helped me stop all ins. 

A month ago I posted: if the game lasts till 10:30 seconds, I win 90% of the time. If it lasts after 15 min or less than 10:30, I lose 90% of the time. (1 rax FE into bio, +1 wep, stim, Medvacs)

Now if the game lasts past 15 min, I win 90% of the time, anything less than 10:30 I'm losing to only insane cheeses(DT rush) or bad luck(I literally walked my army into banelings at 10:30). Those can be improved on if I wasnt careless. 

So ATT, I hope this can help some lower league players. You really can A click(or T + A click if you have stim) most of the time.

If Bomber can beat MC with this flat out, it's good. 

http://www.redbullusa.com/cs/Satellite/en_US/001243035003218

Download the replay there, it's the one on Entombed Valley.

So here it goes:

10 Depot

12 Rax - Orbital immediately after rax

16 CC on lowground. This is at around 3 minutes, no second depot yet and 1st marine is coming.

16 Depot

19 Bunker, you will need protection for any fe as terran.

21 2nd rax, you should have 2 marines and your 3rd one is halfway done.

23 - 3rd rax, you hav e3 marines and bunker is about to complete

24 - take a single gas, when your 3rd rax finishes immediately get a tech lab, marines from all three rax

38 or when tech lab finishes - take second gas

Stim @ 100 gas - this is at around 40 supply

Factory @ 100 gas this is around 50 supply

Your E-bay comes out right after the factory.

You should have 32 scvs at 7 minutes with good macro.

Get +1 as soon as ebay is done and starport as soon as factory is done. Also get a reactor on the factory.

When you get the gas, get a tech lab on second rax.

Start marauders now

Double gas at natural after second tech lab.

Get a reactor on the plain rax, this is right around when the starport finishes.

Get 2 more rax and produce double marauders.

Get 2 medivacs then when you can combat shield then Conc. Shell.

Push when two medivacs pop, timing hits when combat shield +1 and Concussive Shield finish.

Rally to base if necessary,

I use the three rax timing push, but this is a really refined version of that. ENJOY!


Edit: Something else to note, i would scout after the first depot, then scout again at like 4:00, Bomber, being the confidant guy he is doesn't scout at all. This is because his build would not change regardless of what MC was doing but still, what if MC dt rushed?

Anyway, I've caught the HotS tournament fever, and I really want to personally sponsor an online event for Platinum/Diamond players to have a piece of the action too. 

* Entry is free.

* Placement is first-come, first-served. 

* Comment or PM me ASAP with any interest to ensure your place in the competition. Please include your tag, rank, ladder data (W/L record, total points) and preferred race.

* Minimum = 16 players, Max = 32.

* Minimum = Platinum rank, Max = Diamond.

* There will be group play similar to GSL formatting- 4 groups for 16 players, 8 groups for 32 players.

* Seeding will be determined by rank and ladder points.

* Scheduling will be determined on a group-by-group basis, thus the magnitude needs to be smaller. Matches will most-likely take place on weekends or weeknights, depending on the time zones of players.

* 1st place will take home 50$, and 2nd place will take home 20$ (via PayPal).


I am assuming full responsibility for correspondence and scheduling, so please leave a comment or PM me if you are interested. 

Please keep in mind that I work full-time, and am organizing/sponsoring this out of pocket.

A while back I was watching the stream of fray`iaguz (a top australian player) playing on KR and noticed him doing an interesting TvP timing push. I've since adapted it slightly. 

The overall idea is:
- Hit with a stim 2rax at 7:20, pulling up to 8 scvs if you feel like it.
- Kill, cripple, or contain him while establishing your 2nd base
- Fast tech to two medivacs on 2 barracks and hit the 10 minute timing as strong as you would with a normal 1rax FE. (Your upgrades might be stunted.)

The detailed build:
http://www.sc2planner.com/#TaaaaoEaaoFaoDaacoCjoFoQafoEaaiZoPaoEiZakiKafiZoEkaiZakoEaiZakoEiZafaiZkaoAaoIoDaoEiRcafoEkiZaoKoSaiZjaoCiZjaiBaafoEiZkfaaiZkaaaa

Be sure that you are constantly producing from your 2rax. If you sent an scv scout you might have a short break in production but otherwise your CC and 2rax must all be constantly producing. 

Try to fake a conc 2rax by applying a little pressure, perhaps taking their watch tower, but be sure not to lose too much as you want to hit your stim timing strong.

I've tried this build a lot on NA with great success. It is not common in the TvP metagame, so a lot of protoss react poorly, and often think it's a conc 2rax. Since the push happens so early, there is hardly any way for an expanding protoss to defend. Those who try to forcefield you away will find that they only have energy for a couple of forcefields (Although I would recommend this on maps like antiga, cloud kingdom or daybreak where there are wide entrances to the natural). After the stim push, your relatively early medivacs should come as a surprise to them.

The beauty of this build is it's VERY EASY. You don't have to worry about 2 base macro or defending all-ins (if they all-in you they die), and when you attack you can practically A move to victory.

Comments+Criticism welcome!

I apologize for the delay, but since google docs (or ""Google Drive"" as it's known these days) do not seem to be capable of making the type of graph I wanted, I had to use MATLAB which means I can't do it at home. ANYHOW, Here are the pretty pictures of the results

I have also not gotten to add the more recent entries, if someone else wants to write down the relevant numbers at the required times it would be appreciated, but I think I can get it done tonight. 

One questionable thing in these data is that include unfinished units (roughly) to the percentage they are finished. ie, a medivac at ~80% counts as 0.8, instead of 0. I would say this is not stupid, but I can udnerstand why it's not completely honest. 

**Conclusion**

It seems at least our platinum subject was struggling to quite keep up, primarily the ghost production was very late and SCVs were overbuilt. So the answer to the question would then be ""not quite"", however I think already at Diamond it's no real problem building as many units. I would say for myself, learning the build however was quite difficult and took a number of tries. 

So, if we want to do another experment, ""How far can pure macro get you"", we would need someone who currently at least Diamond, or anyone who can show that they can reach the benchmarks.

Boxing/selecting mineral fields!,-Reminisce-,29,4,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1kapey/tip_to_all_bronze_league_all_the_way_to_platinum/,"Well guys! I just felt like giving you guys a reminder, especially the lower ones.  To those who don't know what boxing is, you know when you have a mineral field and the pros seem to do what looks like pointless boxing(selecting) of their scvs? Well, i think i started doing it intensively in diamond league.

What this has resulted in? It has greatly, and when i say greatly, i really mean it has GREATLY improved my splits. Can i say it happened over night? No. But long term i wish i had started doing this earlier.

Now, let me add in that in my opinion and through my experience as well as nit picked tips here and there, to practice effectively you have to

- try to box accurately.
The way i do is is that i say okay, i want to pick the whole mineral field. Okay i just want to select those two, ah now i wanna select the right side of my mineral field, then the whole. You get my point

- I remember watching a video on you tube to further enhance my selection to increase the effectiveness of my splitting. It's some sort of line splitting. What you basically do is you form a vertical or horizontal line. If you do this often enough you can select a whole row of marines and just move them in rows in any direction you like. I began by just trying to split in rows in the marine split challenge and over time i managed to incorporate it into my overall splits. Thus the results were even better.

IMO this is the most important of all:
 
- box in different directions
When i started boxing,i had the habbit of boxing from the top left down. Boxing from the Top right to the left bottom was still okay. However, boxing from bottom to top was horrible for me. After practicing the unused direction in every match up i must say after a few weeks my unit control feels so much more fluid as well as faster. I feel so much faster and better doing it. I did the marine split challenge today after not having done it for a while, i was really impressed with the results.

So to you Terran new comers, unleash the awesomeness of magnificent splits. Make banelings giving you a hard time cost inefficient and together we shall dominate the world. 

Joke a side - if there's any tip i wanted as a new comer from anyone it would have been this, really. Not only does boxing help splitting but it help you build up your accuracy and with greater accuracy greater speed can be achieved. So use this while you ladder and good luck!


just trying to help out if possible :-)

* **TvT**: Detecting widow mines, seeker missiles to tanks and clumps of marines
* **TvP**: Detecting observers, seeker missile to their death ball is HUGELY helpful in either making them back off or eating a ton of damage, PDD against mass stalkers neuters their attack
* **TvZ**: Seeker missile to clumps of units, PDD to neutralize hydras attacks

Hey guys. I hopped onto the KR server today and did the builds I enjoyed in the beta and made a little video for all you all.  It's quickly thrown together, but I've got practicing to do :). 

I know plenty of you didn't play the beta and have no idea what you should be doing opening wise. These are the builds I am going to be doing as of today. ATM they seem to work great. Feedback is greatly appreciated.

Unfortunately I didn't get a replay with a TvT opponent. But the TvZ build is very similar. I talk about it in the video. If you want more. here is a VOD from the IEM 2013 Hots tournament. Yoda vs MVP. Game 1 features the opening I like.

Here's my replay. It's a bit off, because of the early aggression by toss, but the general Idea of the build is:

1. Open up standard - 12rax/12gas reaper into expansion

2. Add quick 2nd gas (right after reactor on rax) and transition into 2 Medivac, 4 Hellbat Drop

3. If he goes Colossus tech, go Vikings right after 2 Medivacs, if not keep doing Medivacs

4. Don't go for quick 3rd, as you are dropping, start upgrades, add 2 gas on natural, and 2 additional Factories

5. Push out with 1/1 Upgrades, 4-6 Siege Tanks and ass many Hellbats/Vikings/Medivacs as possible and at least kill his 3rd if he attempts it, if not go for a kill

6. Add a third

7. Add 2 additonal Factories and go for a kill with 2/2 if you feel like you've done enough damage

8. Otherwise add 2 Starports and go Banshee/Raven/Viking/Hellion composition, with Hellions roaming the map and harrassing as much as possible

9. Terran Air &gt; Protoss Air as you can see if the final battle. PDDs buttrape mass Tempest and against Void Rays, well, you've got Seeker Missiles


A bit off topic: I know my control wasn't perfect, but it was my 5th hour in a row playing, and I was confident I will win no matter what. But yeah, normally you should:

a) Do this Hellion harras I mentioned earlier

b) Send 3-4 Banshees to get rid of those Immortals before they rape your economy

c) In the final fight split Banshees, Focus down the Observers, back up, kill the Templars with banshees and then go in with the rest of your army

d) My Ghost control sucks, but if you feel confident with them, they would make fighting Protoss late game 10x easier

I think frequently people get scared that if they're losing they've ""lost it"" and that leads to ladder anxiety, an idea where you aren't who you once were and you'll only hurt your ranking if you play, but that's a bad attitude.

Get back on the horse and play, practice, and learn. Take a break and get away from starcraft. Watch some helpful videos and get tips. Watch some pro matches to get the feel of what the game should look like back.

Simply pick one of those, do something positive for yourself that lets you feel like you're improving, and then back right back to the game and work through the game.

While sometimes it's effective, often it just seems to be too little too late.

It's not as though I think it is weak; it certainly does a lot of damage. However it is simply not an *efficient* spell.

Here's how Seeker Missile compares to the AoE spells of the other races:

**Cost:** This is my biggest issue with this spell. **It costs 125 energy!** Compare that to the energy cost of Storm or Fungal, both of which cost only 75 energy. This means that an Infestor or High Templar that are maxed out on energy can throw down 2 spells and be only 25 energy from the next one. Whereas a maxed out Raven can use only one Seeker Missile and will be 50 energy away from the next. Let's also not forget that Fungal has no cool-down at all so chains are a possibility, and Storm has a cool-down of just 2 seconds.

**Range:** Seeker Missile has a range of **6**. What is the range of Fungal and Storm? **9.** This does not bug me as much as the cost issue, but it does mean that the Raven must be at the front-lines to send out a missile, and from there it can then easily be picked off.

How can this be improved? Well, a Raven that can chain two Seeker Missiles in a row would be very OP. But right now if we want to kill anything with the missile, we need several Ravens, and we need to get them well before they are actually needed. A good fix would be to reduce the energy cost to 100, but give the spell a cool down of something like 20 seconds. This would ensure Terrans are not just sending volley after volley of missiles, but the spell would actually become useful. 

I'm not looking for a spell caster to win the game for Terrans, but we all know our race has been struggling in the late game vs. the other two races. Infestors and High Templars are standard in Zerg and Protoss armies, but the Raven is often ignored. It is essentially an expensive detector right now. I know I'm saying this to a sub-Reddit full of Terran players and this will never change, but I felt I needed to say something.

**TL;DR** Reduce the energy cost of Seeker Missile and give it a cool down. Maybe even increase its' range.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,icon-rank-platinum,True,t3_v8jt0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/v8jt0/probably_preaching_to_the_choir_but_i_feel_seeker/,

1.  Interested in becoming a mod?  Applications are now being accepted!  If you think you would make a great addition to the team, message the moderators with a little bit about yourself, and why you think you're the guy/gal for the job.  Please put ""Mod Application"" in the subject so we can keep everything organized!

2.  User flair is on its way, we promise.  I can't read a style sheet to save my life, so I've just kind of put the burden of figuring it out on footinmymouth.  If anyone has a good understanding of CSS and would be willing to assist in this, please drop us a message or comment below, as I'm sure footinmymouth would greatly appreciate the help.  For those of you who haven't heard, the plan is to provide flair so that users will be able to show which league they're in.  This will help add context to the advice provided/received, and is all around just a cool thing to have.

3.  The tournament is being sorted out.  The plan is to have a cross-subreddit tournament between the three AllThings communities.  We're trying to figure out a way to provide something that's enjoyable for members of all skill levels, while still being competitive.  We're also trying to figure out how replays/casting could work.  If you have any ideas or suggestions regarding the tournament, please comment with them below; we'd love to hear from you guys on this.

That's all the major stuff we've got for now.  There are a few more plans in the mix, but we want to make them a little more concrete before we present them.  So in summary, mod applications are open, user flair is on its way, and the tournament is being planned.

And I really like it! He has changed some parts but for the most part this is how it goes:

10 depot

12 barracks

16 Build marine

17 Orbital Command

17 Command Centre

17 Double Gas

18 Supply depot

(If you're worried, build a bunker)

@100 gas: Factory

@50 gas: reactor on barracks(you have to have 2 marines, you HAVE to)

@100 gas Factory

@25 gas build tech lab on the barracks then swap with factory

@100 gas Starport

When you can, build the blue-flame hellion upgrade and build as much hellions as possible, poking up with 4-6 with your inital to deny scouting. Build vikings, up to 3 and build an engineering bay while you're attacking. When blue flame finishes, push up with your 10-12 hellions, roast 'em up!

Some pointers about this build and when should you do it:

- You WILL need to scout if he's going for earl roach push, if so you stop hellion production(or continue if it has no add-on) and start building tanks and some marines and build a bunker at the top of the ramp.

- You need to be able to know when to pull out on fights and not commit

- The follow up for this is exclusively mech and you should be getting double gas on your natural in the process of making hellions

- This build originally was blue flame hellions and the starport built a medivac(to drop) which made is susceptible to spire play

- You will float minerals and you need to know when to add more factories and armory and another CC.

- This is a pretty multi-tasking intensive build but as you can see, has the potential to do a lot.

- Counter-attacks are painful and if you see a lot of roaches, immediately start pumping out tanks and research siege mode

Have fun!

Ive been playing SC2 for about 1-2 months and have gotten to the top of silver league doing a rough 1rax FE and occasional 2-4rax if I see the opponent use an irresponsible FE. Then I learned about timing(medvacs+upgrades at 10) and I havnt lost since. 

My worry is that I am aweful mid-late game and soon will play players that can stop this. I dont know what my problem is, I cant position siege tanks. I am getting destroyed by infestors and storm(mainly storm, I cant believe how powerful it is). I cant manage to defend any expansion beyond my natural without leaving my base completly open.

But I can win games without trying doing this timing attack. 

Should I get to a higher league and worry about it then? Should I practice on these lower leagues? I am doing extremely low league things like taking expos extremely far away from my base because I dont get scouted. So what is suggested? 

Bonus: Is spending 550 minerals on OC mid-late game a good idea if I'm not using it as an expo but as a source of scans/mules?

I just realized my title was pretty uninformative.

This is not going to be a specific step by step guide because I won't claim to have optimized this build at all but I've been able to hurt Diamond Zergs quite hard with it because of how rapidly and powerfully it changes its intentions.

Now I am sure you've all considered Marine/Marauder/Hellion harassment as a good move against the new Zerg. Well it's nice, but there's a point in the game where you need the faithful Marine/Tank composition back. I call that moment, Muta Timing.

So, I have found an interesting way to have your cake and eat it too. It starts with a normal one rax fast expand, then you get your second rax, followed by 2 gas, your walloff of choice, and once you feel you can at least survive some light harassment and are confident you are not about to get baneling busted (a few marines and a bunker) throw down 2 reactors, and as soon as you can, 2 factories. Once your factories finish, put them on the 2 reactors, then put 2 tech labs on the 2 Barraks. Start pumping out copious amounts of Mauraders and Hellions with your 2 base econ, and use the 2 tech labs to get stim and combat shields.

Attack his third as soon as it finishes. You can either kill it, or force a huge response (as in, not droning like a madman). In my last 2 games, I prevented him from even dropping his third, and then in the very next game I destroyed his third and 2 queens. While doing so, you'll find that stim and combat shield finishes, AND you can afford a third command center once you lay off the quad-hellion production. Immediatly switch the factories and barracks positions and drop a starport and 2 engi bays as soon as you can. You are now producing 4 marines with stim and combat shields, and 2 seige tanks at a time. Add gas as is your preference and 1-2 more barracks.

So now, we are geared up and producing marine tank, with 3 base, perhaps having denied the Zergs third, a lot of creep, some queens, and maybe even having your group of marauder hellion survive and sitting at home.

There are a lot of edges to be rounded in this build (which is why I share theory and not hard numbers). I find I have a surplus of money and yet am still beating Diamond players. Starport can go down sooner, more rax can come sooner. Upgrade timings are questionable. But the important thing is, you get to have pretty ideal Rauder/Hellion harassment early game, and Marines with Stim/Combat Shields before Mutas become a problem for you.

Good luck slaying bugs folks!

EDIT: As requested, here is a [replay](http://drop.sc/213829). Now I have to make sure to say a few things about this game. I am Platinum currently (was demoted after inactivity and getting rusty, previously top8 diamond) opponent was mid diamond. I get a really big mineral surplus early on because I was not experienced with this build enough to know to drop extra barracks sooner.

**Few observations about this game:**

* Notice at the end that my macro sucks? If yours is better, it would have been easy to turn that surplus I was running when I was 110/160 into a 15 minute max out even after all that pressure
* He had the larva, and the tech to throw a bunch of lings at my push, but he sat on it because his eyes filled with greed, he saw 1 marine with a bunch of mauraders and hellions and thought that if he waited on muta he could crush me, but he had no idea I was producing marines, with combat shields, and stim with double engi as if I was going marine tank from the start, plus lings don't do so well against hellions
* It looks really strong against mutas, but keep in mind this guys mutas were at 11, I've seen them as early as 9:30, but I DID have an engi bay and could have dropped turrets to defend that easily.
* He uses crawlers, I think queens are stronger, they deal less damage to mauraders, but they take reduced damage from them as well. (As they are not light nor armoured)

EDIT2: I am also looking for optimizations and criticisms! I am sharing this idea not just to help others, but to ask for help!

EDIT3: Here is another [replay](http://drop.sc/213847) of the same build but I think handled a little better. In this game he attempts a 2 base bane bust and almost has me, but luckily the unit composition and ability to switch into marine tank holds true. He does not even try for a third early, and so my army only serves to kill some creep initially because I did not want to overextend. In the end, I prevailed because this build lets me confidently be on the map, and slingshots me towards a good econ.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,1341309385.0,,icon-rank-diamond,True,t3_vyv7i,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/vyv7i/the_double_double/,

So I have switched over to Terran for now to practice, HOWEVER, it's a world of difference in difficulty for me for some reason

 I have serious issues with storm, literally, I know exactly what the answer is and I even know what to look for when toss is about cast them but they still shred me, I haven't been able to land a good enough EMP to hit EVERY HT and 1-2 storms just destroy me, not really sure how to deal with them

 I also don't fully understand drops, I mean, I do drop but 1 of 2 things happen, 1. I do no damage whatsoever and they clean it up and kill the medevac 2. I do no damage whatsoever because they pulled probes fast enough and I just pick up and try and hit another part and the same thing happens. I can never actually do damage with drops it's always just pull probes, clean drop, zzzzzz. I have dropped like the zerg 3rd and main at the same time and it worked okay but still the pulling probes thing just made it do next to no damage.

 TvZ I also fine myself being completely outmacroed, I do reaper expand into 6 hellion into marine mine marauder but when I push out mutas either destroy my base or they literally just run over me with units even though I am on 2-3 base keeping minerals under 1000 with 40-60 workers.

The build is:

-8 depot

-8 (proxy) rax #1

-8 refinery

-8 (proxy) rax #2

...reapers (Can't let the first three die)

...a supply depot/Orbital/scv's 

(This is just my experience from the games I've played in Diamond and does not cover everything)

TvT: Unless they do the same build, bunkers and marines for defense just don't cut it. Reapers are too fast and can just outmaneuver the Terran arsenal. Enemy Reapers and Hellions can be picked off because they move faster than Marines. Widow Mines only kill one Reaper at a time.

TvZ: A fast pool and speedlings can spell disaster. Queens die to 3 reapers that are micro'd, Spine Crawlers can block a crucial point or they are easily avoided. Basically it's just kiting lings away from the Queen and then once the lings are dead, kill the Queen.

TvP: Morthship Core is too slow and does very little dmg. Zealots can be kited, and it takes about 3 reapers with micro to take down a Stalker. Even the Planetary Nexus can't stop them because by the time they get the energy from the core, the damage has been done. Also, by the time the first Stalker gets out (3:45ish), you have 3 reapers at the base and 2 more on the way.

Reapers are arguably more powerful in HotS then they ever were in WoL...

It's pretty common for Terran to struggle against Zerg, especially in gold-diamond. I wanted to give you guys a good opening that not only puts you ahead economically, but also adequately defends against virtually any cheese you might face. 

It's a cc-first build that allows you to get out hellions and banshees at the same time as you would in a 1rax fe. I originally saw Flash doing this, though I doubt he was the first. The build goes a little something like this:

_______________________________________

10 depot at ramp 

(Scout with this scv when it's done with the depot. If you see a hatch first, you can build your cc on the low ground in your natural. If you see a pool first, build your cc at your ramp so you can wall off). You should also see if he goes for gas after his hatch-first. This is very indicative of pressure/all-in play.

14 cc

16 barracks (completing wall if your cc is at your ramp)

17 get 1 gas

Make both cc's into orbitals

make 2 marines + bunker at natural

@100 gas build factory

@~ 4:45 build second gas 

@50 gas build reactor on barracks (your factory will be done well before your reactor is completed. You should have time to build a single hellion before you swap)

@complete factory, build starport. Transfer factory onto reactor, start tech lab with barracks

@complete starport, transfer onto tech lab, begin banshee and cloak

--------------------------------

If you hit your timings correctly, you should have your hellions out at about 6:30, with time to scout an all-in. Your econ will be stronger than if you went for a 1 barracks fe, so you'll be able to throw down your third faster than normal. From about 8:00 onward, it's all about scouting. Because hellion-banshee isn't indicative of what your composition will be, you can easily transition into either bio or mech.

Woohoo!  Perhaps you've already noticed, but at the top of the page, we now have a sticky that will redirect you to the current weekly stream post!  Please use it to support your fellow hero Terrans who are currently online as they kick butt on the ladder!  Just because someone is Gold or Plat doesn't mean that their stream might not be awesome to watch!  I think I can speak for all streamers when I say that actually having viewers watching you play (and interacting with you via chat) is one of the best feeling you can have after a tough loss or a sick win.

Huge shoutout to Tasky and MrPig for helping me get through all the CSS stuff involved with setting up the sticky, and again to Tasky for hosting the website that forwards us to the current weekly stream post instead of just the search of previous weekly stream posts.

-----
**Serious Stuff**

On a different note...now that we have a working sticky, and visibility of the current streams is no longer an issue, there will be a more hardball approach taken towards people who post their stream links outside of these weekly posts.  It is on the sidebar already, but I just want to reiterate: you CANNOT post links to your streams outside of the weekly posts.  Redditors who repeatedly break this rule will be banned (everyone has been warned every time this rule has been broken so far, so don't worry about accidental bans or anything of that nature).  Feel free to advertise your stream (we WANT you, streamers), but just keep it to the weekly posts so that everything is more organized and people know where to look to find their favorite streamers.  Thanks for your cooperation on this rule!

-----
**Chat Channel Stuff**

Also, just another thing I wanted to remind you guys/gals about: in the actual Starcraft 2 client, come hang out with everyone by joining the chat channel ""**AllThingsTerran**"" without the quotes.  We all know how lonesome B.NET can be without people to talk to sometimes, so be sure to idle in the chat channel with your fellow Terran brethren to shoot the shit or set up some custom games when you're not pwning up the ladder!  This applies to both Wings of Liberty AND Heart of the Swarm.  We have a chat channel in both of these--but the fun you have is directly proportional to the amount of you guys that chill there,--so let's get everyone in on this party!

----
**GosuBuilds Stuff**

Lastly, on a more personal note, I wanted to formally let everyone know that GosuBuilds will in fact be switching over to Heart of the Swarm.  However, because it's still in beta and balance changes are no doubt going to occur between now and March 12th, the official switch over to Heart of the Swarm will only happen ON March 12th and not before.  If you're looking for a build between now and then, a couple little birdies told me that opening hellbat drop was a pretty good idea ;D

----
**TL;DR** 

Check the sticky at the top of the page to watch your favorite streamers!  Don't post your stream links anywhere else except the current weekly stream post!  Come hang out in the chat channel AllThingsTerran in both WoL and HoTS!  Gosubuilds is switching over to HoTS on March 12th!

I feel it's completely out of my control and I lose games because this type of harass really affects the most vulnerable moments of your mid-late game.

Despite that horrid run-on sentence, what do you guys think? Also considering that burrow is moved to the hatchery in the new beta patch

edit: a lot of ppl are misunderstanding me. FOR EXAMPLE. If I were David Kim, I would make the moving roach/infestor a TAD more visible with their trail a little longer.. stop mentioning turrets and sensor towers please.

1345833995.0,22,self.AllThingsTerran,yrn7u,Lower league paradox.,Ethic13,25,3,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/yrn7u/lower_league_paradox/,"Hey ATT,
Recently while I have been looking for solid macro terran strategies versus zerg I have noticed a trend of circular logic.

So from a general overview of tvz strategy the game plan for most terrans is to fast expand and proceed to do damage to the zerg economy (either by killing workers or forcing them to produce combat units) so that their drone count stays low. From what I have seen, the two ""standard"" strategies to accomplish this are 2rax bunker pressure or hellion/banshee play. 
From a lower level point of view where apm and consequently multitasking ability are lacking, both of these strategies can be particularily difficult to pull off properly.

So when me and other lower league players (ie. bronze-gold) ask for macro builds to use vs zerg (and other matchups as well) we seem to recieve a lot of answers that give two or three paragraphs of ""this build is good because..."" and end with ""...but it requires good multitasking.""

The logic problem I notice is that there is a fundamental diffrence between the advice given to lower league players for improvement and ""how to play.""
So when an unskilled player goes searching for a standard build (in tvz for example), 1rax FE into hellion/banshee is pretty likely to pop up. 
Then later, after they have troubles performing it properly and start asking why, the answer is something like: ""dont worry about using such a micro/multitasking intensive build. The trick to get better is focusing on macro.""
And even further on after that, the same player might be focused on something like the filtersc style that is more or less enphasised for its focus on macro. And they will lose games, a lot of games, because that style can be beaten simply from the diffrence in the fundamental ways the three races work.
The player might then go back to the internet searching for an answer to why they keep losing. And the answer might very well be: ""a macro style like that doesn't work for terran because zerg can just get 70-80 drones and get lair tech freely, then crush your attack. What works right now, is fast expand into hellion/banshee, you can even play greedy and get a third OC. Its awesome...but requires good multitasking.""

And that is where I have come full circle. I have also searched for answers to this paradox, and have seen people suggest Mech and Sky Terran styles, but most of them end with ""...Is it viable?"" I have seen cases presented by both sides, and it just seems like they are too specialized for beginers to realy start improving with (Especialy the aggresive variants).

This is a train of logic I have been frustrated by personaly, but it hasn't dulled my love of the game. I still love playing terran, and I dont plan on switching at any point. I have always loved the theme of millitary determination and holding the line. The dig your heels in and take whatever comes ideal is something that keeps me coming back. (I even beat the campaign again recently and that gave me a huge morale boost)

But to end my tangent I have to ask: What builds/openers/styles, if there are any, can lower league terrans use that dont require managing more than their base and a SINGLE aspect of their forces? All in the effort to focus on macro play without trying to stretch their multitasking so far.

As more units are introduced into the game, hard counters and momentum swings are more frequent. Momentum swings open you up to take a base, which means the more units --&gt;the more momentum swings --&gt; the more bases taken --&gt; the more epic the game.

In WoL the momentum shifts were less frequent and although there was some scaling as up the tech ladder most games would be I am going to make these units and just macro better than you and throw them at you and you have to handle them, especially for terran.

In HotS The swings are so much more fun, you'll be crushing an army late and then bam --&gt; he pumps out enough of x or y unit you can't handle that pushes you back, he expands, and remaxes. You as a terran then make new units to counter what you just saw and push him back, and then he counters back and forth you go until you finally wear the other player down. This game really leaves you wishing you had more hotkeys.

I played multiple games this weekend where I walked away and thought ""wow that game was so much fun...these new units really make a difference""

-Most recently watching Polt's games in GSL vs Parting and Sniper. The game vs Parting (where polt opened mass rax only) I was astonished to see that Parting almost held it off after Polt went no tech and only Rax. Parting was not only able to get 3 bases AND some 9-10 gates, he got templars and was getting storm. Polt pulled a W and that was good.

-But the game vs Sniper where he goes 2fac/reactor hellion AND marauders again against a person that gets 3 bases and Sniper holds it off! I was so astonished and angry at the same time. Polt cranked out soo many units and Sniper held while teching to mutas. It just frustrates me to see neither Protoss nor Zerg have any fear in their builds anymore. They know they can get away with what they please, shy from being 11/11 raxed.

-We've been reduced, nay forced into long macro-esque games vs races that are better at macro and who's ultimate goal is to reach longer game times, because they actually have viable and very potent higher tier units.

I dont know if anyone will care about this thread or if another thread like this already exists, but i think MVP is a fucking hero.

Never mind the fact that he has 4 GSL championships under his belt, and the fact he is arguably the best Terran in the world. 
What im talking about is playing with 2 massive injuries/disabilities that would otherwise deter someone from playing the game completely, and still being an amazing player. To those who dont know, he has carpal tunnel in both his wrists and he also has cervical kyphosis which basically means his neck bends the wrong way round and this causes his pain/serious discomfort while playing starcraft.

Somewhere on reddit someone had also said he keeps playing because his family is poor, so he is basically just earning money for his whole family. I dont know if this is true, but if it is then he is even more of a hero to me.
He is my age, and has health problems i would frankly be scared of having, yet he keeps going.
I hope that the operation he will have for his cervical kyphosis pays off, cos i would hate to see someone as amazing as him leave starcraft.

TL;DR MVP has carpal tunnel in both wrists and has cervical kyphosis and keeps playing. He is a hero.

So, TvP on Ohana. The whole game ends up being low-eco because the Toss pushed and shut down Illu's 3rd while Illu himself killed the Toss's third and his building 4th. ~10 minutes of back and forth brawls and micro battles occurs. Illu is right now pushing at Toss's front and about to break the threshhold just slightly and be able to push through, and then the P sends a zealot to Illu's re-established 3rd (its the main CC, each player couldn't afford 400 min investment because they'll simply get run over). What Illusion does instead of losing all of his SCVs or sending back his army, he instead pulls his SCVs and finds the SCV that the Zealot was target to (the Toss probably did shift-A-click to harass), and had that one run to Illu's army and sent the rest of the SCVs back to mine. Thusly, the Zealot follows that one SCV (the P's multitasking is being spent trying to hold off Illusion's force at the front) and he doesn't end up winning now, but he kills some probes and after a few more battles he pushes threw to get victory. If he had not done that move and allowed the Zealot to kill the workers he would have no eco to fall back on, and if he pulled his workers then he would've lost so much mining time he would've probably lost to the P's counter attack due to his stunted production.

I REALLY need a build that just works, not a super risky 3 orbital before building attacking units build, and not a build that requires 300 apm for marine micro.  Here's what I've tried so far:


My build used to be a blue flame attack at the natural while dropping 8 marines in the main and expanding.  I would always do enough damage to put myself ahead economically.  In the few times that I tried this build since the patch I did zero damage and lost soon after to a roach attack.


I started doing 1 rax expand, I tried about 15 times, won once and lost the other 14 times to roach all ins (but understand that an all in for zerg is never an all in because they can just make 15 drones at a time if it fails).  [Replay (this is a Kas build with helions, I've tried pure bio at the beginning as well with the same result)](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/37635/Roach%20Bust.SC2Replay)



Then I tried for a 1 rax expand with a rush to siege tank, by the time I was in a position to push the zerg had been on 3-4 bases for far too long for me to do a thing. [Replay, I know the push could have been microed better, but it just makes me angry that there is zero micro required on the zerg side, just a-move and go back to what you were doing.](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/37635/Tank%20push%20fail.SC2Replay)


Then I tried a one base all in with helion/marauder/marine... lost to lings and spines every time.  The last time the zerg actually double expanded before 20 supply due to a expo block at his natural and my one base all in still failed. [Replay, How is that balanced?  If a zerg did a one base build and I was on 3 base the results would be laughable. ](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/37635/3%20base%20zerg%20vs%201%20base%20terran.SC2Replay) 


And just for kicks I'll throw in this last replay of some zerg who double hatch'ed in my base and then built roaches.  [I nearly quit the game after this.](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/37635/proxies.SC2Replay)


Sorry for the rage in the replays.  I'm usually a ""gg'er"", but after 20 zerg losses and normal stats vs every other race it starts to wear on me.

For example on maps like Ohana or Antiga Shipyard, where the ramp down from the natural is wide and a long way from the expansion CC, am I better off placing the bunker at the top of the ramp to take advantage of high-ground vision, or is it better placed closer to the expansion CC so that pulled SCVs can get there to repair faster?

0) Remap the Caps Lock key to Control as God intended. Do it at an operating system level, your pinky will thank you. 


1) Factories and starports have their own control group for easy production, but they get also put in the barracks control group so I can rally everything at once. Basically it's rax, factories, starports on 4, factories on 5, starports on 6.

2) Ebays/armories/both (depending on if I play bio or mech) in the command centers control group so I look at them all the time and don't forget upgrades.

3) Make F1-F4 goto location keys (I have F5-F8 the ""set location"" hotkeys - F5 sets the F1 location, etc.). W can be the idle worker key. I also have Space as an extra location key I can set at various map places I need to go to ASAP, it's the only location I'll change midgame. F1-F4 I set at the game start to the main, natural, natural third and natural fourth.

4) Remap the Liftoff/Land key - it is so important and so hard to get to - I use F and now I can swap addons like a pro. 

5) Remap morph to fortress (G), load units in CC/PF (C - right next to the unload D command) - lifting a command center, queuing a move order, a load SCVs command, another move order, an unload SCVs command at the edge of the target base, then queuing the landing order is now orders of magnitude easier.

1341469400.0,19,self.AllThingsTerran,w2egs,Jjakji's fast 3 cc build (the new standard TvZ),10khours,24,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/w2egs/jjakjis_fast_3_cc_build_the_new_standard_tvz/,"Like many others, I was having trouble in TvZ (high Diamond, facing masters ATM). I found any 2 base timing attacks would be fended off easily by the Zerg leaving me behing in economy and struggling against a Zerg who was heading towards their infestor and hive tech which is so cost efficient.

Then I saw Jjakji playing against MVP Monster in GSL code A. He absolutely destroyed him. So I went through the vod and wrote down the build. I have been using it with great success. With this build, you can actually get a supply lead at 10 minutes against a zerg without even engaging him! Here is the build I ripped from the GSL vod:

http://www.gomtv.net/2012gsls3/vod/67571/?set=2&amp;lang=

* 10 depot
* 12 barracks
* 17 orbital
* 17 cc
* 18 depot
* constant marine/scv production, rally marines to ramp
* 23 third cc
* 24 refinery
* 24 refinery
* 25 orbital at nat
* 32 factory
* still constant marines and scvs
* 36 2 more rax (eventually you want 3 rax, 1 tech lab and 2 reactor)
* 36 make reactor on 1st barracks (will be used for reactor hellions)
* 37 bunker
* 44 start making reactor hellions until you have 6
* 46 double ebay
* 60 stim
* 60 starport
* 60 double gas at nat
* 73 1/1 upgrades
* 85 armory  

This is nothing new, I'm sure many other koreans are using this build. The basic idea of this build is to get 3 quick command centres and double ebays for upgrades. Roughly 6 hellions are made to take map control and deny creep spread before transitioning into either blue flame hellion+bio or tanks+bio (up to you guys which you want to do, I prefer hellions on bigger maps such as daybreak).

Once your first 2 medivacs are out, it is time to start pressuring the zerg. 10:00 - 12:00 is an extremely important time because this is the time when zerg is weakest (due to their tier 2 tech not being fully developed yet). Deny any attempt for a fourth. Drop the main and pressure his third at the same time. Keep the zerg on the backfoot. You should be trading cost efficiently by splitting the zergs army and dropping in mineral lines (drop in tight locations where the zerglings can only attack one marine at a time). If the zerg is going infestors, drops will do so much damage as they will have almost no way to kill the medivacs. Every time 2 medivacs come out, load them with marines and drop again. Aim to have at least 2 battles (3 is beter) going on at once so the zerg has to split his army and run around with his slow infestors.

 If he is going muta then you should stop dropping. The great thing about this build is you always have an amazing 3 base economy and double upgrades going back home. You can just keep trading with the zerg and never let him get a 4th.


Anyway, I hope this build will help my fellow struggling terrans.

Open up with the normal reactor expand, getting 6 hellions

while getting the hellions, tech lab the rax and get stim while getting 2 marauders(safety for roach rush)

After the 6th hellion is out, add 2 rax, and put a reactor onto the factory with the intent to swap on to one of the barracks

While getting the 2 barracks, add a 2nd gas, and get an engi bay

Once the 2 rax and the factory is done with the reactor, add a starport, and get another reactor on the factory

When the engi finishes, get +1 attack, get combat shields when your stim finishes researching.

When the starport finishes, swap with factory. get another reactor on factory and start getting medivacs constantly from the starport. move out on 2 medivacs with 20-ish marines, 2 marauders, and +1 attack. 

this move-out should be around 10minutes-10:30, and should catch a few things. first, it should catch the zerg just as his(usually) mutas pop out and he doesn't have much gas to make banelings. second, it should catch him as his third base is finishing up and he's going to want to have been droning up as he'll have probably recently cleared out your hellions to have taken that third base.

While pushing out, you should be able to afford a 3rd base, then when your combat shields is done(around the time you push out) you swap off your factory with the barracks so you have 3 reactored barracks.

When you get your third base, depending on how well you macro(I macro fairly badly) grab 3-4 more rax and get reactors on all, add a 2nd factory, and if they go infestors, add a starport with a tech lab(otherwise, stay without that 2nd starport)

Basically, this style allows you to make A TON(18) marines at a time, with a large number of medivacs as you started the production early, and a good number of tanks. I have found that with this style I can attack over and over again with mass amounts of marines and resupply quickly. the early attack almost always does damage, and if it doesn't, I can simply pick up all but a very few of my marines, and go back to base. 

The style I'm employing in the mid game, is a highly upgraded heavy marine setup, with not too many tanks, and a ton of medivacs. if you can split well, and keep your upgrades constant(double upgrading all the time.. you have the one engi up until you're 65-75% done your +1 armor, then add another engi and an armory to double upgrade as soon as you can +2)

The style I employ in the late game, is very few ghosts, mostly marine tank viking, and constant pushes towards his far bases while dropping his main and taking out tech.

You may or may not like this post, or agree with what I do, but I figured I'm bored in class right now, have the time, and before I quit for a while(I'm back now) I was able to consistently beat top masters and low GM zergs without problem, while I think my overall skill was much lower(My TvT and TvP were only mid-masters)

*very late edit*

I forgot to add, every base I take, I always add 4 rax, 1 fact, and when I see them get hive, I add 3 starports(total 4). if they go ultra, I always get a total of 5 starports, 2 having techlabs, and I make banshees, causing them to waste fungals and they can actually do enormous damage(to econ, or just sniping infestors) if they don't have mutas. I have so many starports because of zerg's larva mechanic. because I don't like the use of ghosts(which of course is simply my preference, feel free to use them if you like ghosts) I need to be able to power out a large number of vikings in a very quick period to stop them from just building 15-20 corrupters, making 5-6 broodlords and rolling my army.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,True,,icon-rank-masters,True,t3_scr6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/scr6l/the_openingstyle_that_got_me_90_win_rate_in_tvz/,

As you all may or may not know, yesterday, Polt went 4-0 vs the Jaedong the Tyrant (murica). 

The wins, while incredibly close, have sparked a LOT of controversy, not just among the Zerg players (don't go onto ATZ now, it's not pretty), but also spectators who don't even play the game (in r/starcraft and friends who don't even play SC2). The concept that biomine can start a chain reaction parade after a few good connections, and the fact that biomine can trade very well regardless of upgrade disadvantage, meant that Polt's constant aggression and impeccable micro gave him some very close wins.

Because biomine is mostly mineral based and forces gas reactions from Zerg to hold, it means that the Terran is essentially trading minerals to delay or starve Zerg from getting to hive tech by continually forcing large batches of banelings that costs hundreds of gas per wave. 

So I'm going to ask you guys (and please keep it civil), what do you make of yesterday's games, the current balance, how both Polt and Jaedong played, and how do you guys just feel in general about yesterday's set?

I'm losing to roach/hydra, ling/bane busts, roach busts or get contained by early speedlings like Life does.

I think I ended last season with like a 28-29 win ratio vs Z at mid-masters level so I'm not *that* bad. It just feels like 3CC is so easily punishable, and if not punished, the unit composition isn't exactly reliable as mines are easily ""disabled"" or have such random damage that they have the chance to maim your own army as much as it does the opponent's. For that same reason, bio/mine doesn't trade efficiently straight up with roach/hydra either.

Versus a muta/ling player who is massing mutas (like 30+), I feel like I can get harassed to death and pulled completely apart right around the time that my 3-base econ kicks in, but before my 2-2 is done. My planned non-stop mid game push is delayed, much weaker, and by the time 5/3 Ultras are out, the game is already over.

As we saw with Maru vs Soulkey, it appears that a sky terran transition isn't exactly the sure fire answer either so essentially we play with bio throughout the entire game.

I need some pointers - I'm watching my replays and literally don't know what I can do as I've been trying to play as standard as possible. By standard, I mean reaper/hellion openers or simply cutting units at 4 hellions and going for quicker upgrades and production. Since I'm now trying to progress and play at a higher level, I'm not looking to do anything gimmicky. I just want to be able to make the Zerg opponent feel the same way that I feel right now.

Honestly, I don't think Blizzard really understands how powerful they have made the reaper. It's basically a tier 0.5 Mutalisk with an even faster regeneration ability. Stalkers DO NOT counter Reapers until they have 5 or 6 of them (enough to have 3 on each side of their base).
Once you have 5-6 reapers out (especially with the 10HP Buff) all it takes is a little micro to fight Stalkers head on. 

It is VERY EASY to kill a stalker with 3 reapers, the important part is that you can't ever lose your reapers. I strive to keep my reapers alive until I'm on 3 base.

I basically open Reapers and start pumping out siege tanks one at a time... then I get 2 more factories ASAP and start pumping out widow mines. I've been able to defend immortal pushes and blink-stalker all-ins with ease because of the threat of reapers delaying these pushes.

The only weakness is a very fast oracle before I get my E.Bay and turrets up, but with the first reaper I can easily scout that coming and make an earlier E.Bay.

Here is the build, formatted in SC2 Scrapbook format:
__________________

 #@~5:30 E.Bay (1) + Factory (2) (3)
 
 #When E.bay is finished, build turrets if you scout a Stargate*

_________________
I then go on to get a Starport &amp; Armory, and reactors on factories 2 &amp; 3. I start building battle hellions and go for double Battlehellion turbo medevac drops (god it sounds awesome just saying that). These Battlehellion drops are INCREDIBLY powerful, I have had them succeed in killing 10-15 probes even with a nexus cannon and multiple regular cannons to intercept.

This is a build designed to get a decent economy going, while destroying as much of the Protoss economy in the process. I win in the mid-game every time with a composition of Siege-Tanks, Battlehellions, and Ghosts for Immortals.

If Protoss starts trying to go air you do NOT need Vikings, 2/2 Thors with high-impact payload are plenty capable of handling the low number of Air units protoss will be able to get out before you make your 200/200 MECH push. Alternatively if you're really worried about the late-game protoss air composition, you can do a 140/150 push to contain Protoss on 3 Bases. With a Planetary at your third and widow mines in your main you shouldn't have too much trouble cleaning up any harass.

If the Protoss manages to build up a decent air composition, you will have to transition into Viking and possibly Raven if there is Tempests (with a few ghosts to prevent Storms on your Vikings which will inevitably cluster together). The important thing is to keep doing Hellbat drops if the Protoss is leaving his mineral lines vulnerable at all.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,1358475427.0,,,True,t3_16sd1t,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/16sd1t/since_the_reapers_got_buffed_in_hots_i_thought_id/,

He is currently rank 78 Grandmaster on NA.  He told me the following:

-1Rax FE is a stronger build than CC first in TvP.  This is largely due to the fact that CC first gives you few reactionary options against a greedy Protoss.

-Against a Nexus first build, the best response is to take double gas immediately after your CC goes down and to go straight into hellion banshee (similar to what is common in TvZ right now).

-A Protoss player normally won't have their first stalker out (much less a sentry) until around 5 minutes into the game if they go Nexus first.  This leaves them extremely vulnerable to a hellion runby in the natural.

-In addition, their robo will be delayed, leaving them with no detection when you show up with banshees.  You can keep them pinned with those banshees until they get at least 3 observers out (one for each mineral line and one for their army)

-Behind this, you are basically free to do whatever you want.  They have to prioritize defense or they will lose their entire economy.

I am going to try this next time I see a Nexus first.  I find this preferable to going for the greed race.

I have been playing SC2 since release and at the beginning I was absolutely terrible.

I was originally placed in bronze, which I certainly deserved.

Because stim used to have such a short research time, and people used to be a lot of worse, I was able to 3 Rax all-in my way into gold, and then eventually in low platinum by the end of season 1 with a variety of relatively cheesy plays.

There are always aggressive builds that can get you some wins on ladder but I felt as though I really wanted to improve my overall game. I committed myself to only going for big macro plays and let my opponent do the early attacking.

A thread full of mindless ranting, but i do have question, and i am asking for help.

How do I regain my interest and find fun in Terran again?

I am fairly new to the game with about 250 games played in platinum. I have always been a fan of Terran. When i watched Brood War i always rooted for the Terran, when i got SC2 i knew what race i would play because i enjoyed watching people like MMA,MVP, and MKP do so many things at once so damn good. 

Lately i have been having issues though. The constant losing to zergs, a match up which was my best, has left me not wanting to even play the game anymore. I'll watch GSL and get excited at the sight of any terran winning vs a zerg. It makes want to get on and ladder, so i will. Then i will run into that zerg. And i will get steam rolled.

I recently decided to try Zerg. I went on a pretty nice win streak knowing only the basics (15 hatch ZvT, 14/14 ZvZ, and the stephano build ZvP). I started playing mid to high diamonds, and i was winning. So i decided to play Terran again thinking because i was doing so well with Zerg that maybe i got better overall and would finally start winning again as Terran.

I didn't. I lost, and lost, and lost some more.

I know many Terrans have switched to Protoss or Zerg because they were getting into rough patches where the grass seems greener on the other side. But i am trying to stick with Terran.

So my question is, how do you keep playing Terran whenever you go through a rough patch?

Does it seem like i am more suited for the swarm? Or is it merely something most Terrans go through once you hit high platinum?

I am a Master terran, and TvZ just isn't fun anymore. It doesn't help when 50-60% of the games are vs Z either. I used to appreciate this matchup because it was pretty balanced, but it's clearly not.

I have tried everything that leads into lategame because I thought I would be able to handle it, I thought the patch whine was overrated, but I simply can't comprehend TvZ anymore. I have tried various mech builds, pure bio and marine tank and nothing works the way I want it to. A single mistake when controlling the army leads either to a) surrounded while unsieged or b) a fungal hits 30 marines. Mech can also die really easily, and isn't as strong any more when the Zerg has such a ridiculous economy. Since economy growth in this game is exponential. Let's assume they are playing greedy from the start. Now add the fact that they discover Oh nice, he's going mech. I will now play greedy. He is now playing as greedy as he can and has 80 drones by what feels like the 4min mark. Mech is only good if you are maxed but I have seen brood lords as fast as 17 minutes when they rush for them.

Now, Zerg is stronger both mid-game and late-game, so I want to strike where my strength lies.

The shit a Zerg can pull off is just ridiculous, so I am just going to all-in every game now.

After playing several hundred games versus terran I have a decent idea of what zergs really struggle to deal with.  This is not an exact build order, but more like a series of milestones I suggest you try to hit during your games in order to maximize your effectiveness.  Here we go.


1. Bunker rush the natural with 2 scv's and 2-4 marines at most.
2. Transition into reactored helions, produce 4 to clear out creep.  Keep them alive for as long as possible (don't go into the base to kill drones), they will be useful throughout the early-mid game.
3. While this is happening, build a tech lab on the rax, research stim.
4. Put the rax back on the reactor and expo when possible.
5. Build a qxc bunker with 4 marines at the bottom of the zerg's ramp to stop creep.
6. Build starport on the tech lab while building a reactor on the factory.
7. Build 2 uncloaked banshees and have them simultaneously attack 2 locations.
8. Swap the starport and factory add ons and build 2 vikings to kill overlords.
9. Move into mass marine, tank and medivac production.
10. Set up a strong seige line while dropping everywhere.


This is a zerg's worst nightmare and makes full use of terran's capabilities.  Obviously I haven't worked out exact timings or building counts, but these ideas are solid.

How are you guys doing?,glassbottle,19,-1,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/tk5rr/tvz_right_now_how_are_you_guys_doing/,"As of the recent patch, obviously a lot of things we were doing before are far less effective and some are suggesting aren't even viable anymore.

Right this moment, I have Bomber's stream open to see when he hits a zerg. The matchup looks pretty rough, but he's still winning games and experimenting. One game he completely skipped hellions and went straight for marine-tank off a 1rax FE with a fast 3rd, for example.

When other good terrans are online and streaming, I'll see what they're doing in reaction to the patch. Hopefully you're not all just raging and crying imbalance.

As for myself... I'm just a mid-diamond on NA, so I'm not actually very good. I don't have any clear ideas on how to approach this matchup anymore, but I'm not defeatist whatsoever so I mean to kick around ideas on my own until either a good terran figures something out.

What are other terrans doing in tvz? I have some ideas, but I honestly couldn't say if they're legitimately viable.

&gt;**EDIT:** To clarify the purpose of this thread, I am only interested in what terrans are doing about 5 range queens. What sort of openings are you doing? What are you doing to pressure zerg early? Are you even pressuring at all?

&gt;Anything you were doing a week ago isn't nearly as strong as it is now, because a zerg can just make 6 queens and be safe from relatively everything. Unless blizzard reverts queens back to 3 range attack, it seems like we have to redesign the matchup.

NoseKnowsAll have done a write-up similar to this one on IMBAbuilds [here](http://imbabuilds.com/hots-terran/hots-tvz/tvz-lucifrons-2-base-hellbat-drops/) (I would recommend the one on IMBAbuilds if you want to transition into mech). But this game was abit different aswell. The biggest thing was ofc the transition! The opener was abit different, but not alot.


This is my 2nd write-up of a build so any criticism is welcome! I wish to make these as good as possible so that you guys learn as much as possible!

What is the standard control groups setup for a terran?
Is it something like 1 2 3 army, 4 cc, 5 rax, 6 factory, 7 starport, 8 9 0 ??
are there any sweet tricks to make things easier, like moving the 0 to the button near the 1 (above tab) and use it for army/drops/whatever?
For example, i once read that it is a good idea to keep ebays in the same group as the cc. I'm looking also for this kind of advice.

I believe this makes a huge difference if you think about the way surrounds work in Starcraft. It is much harder to form a concave around an attacking army than it is A-move a group of melee units into one, and I believe this has played a significant role in the skill disparity in lower and higher league play. Not only do marines and marauders have to stutter step backwards to avoid melee damage-- during the entire course of the game this also removes significant time that could be spent macroing at home. 

I think that the Battle Helion in HOTS is a perfect melee unit, and I feel that its presence in WoL was sorely missed. That being said, I hope it doesn't get nerfed, considering the insane amount of success it has had in the Beta.

As a result, I recently dropped back into Diamond from low Masters.  I really needed something like this that was just super enjoyable.  Hopefully this will be what gets me back on the right track.

Have a look.  I played a pretty standard Bomber build timing push that allowed me to get up a much earlier 3rd and out macro my opponent.  The game was pretty over well before the good nuke landed, but it was an oh so satisfying way to finish the game.

As we approach 2,000 Hero Terrans (woo!), I would just like to share my thoughts on the current state of the subreddit as a whole, and you guys, the Redditors that make it what it is.

Firstly, I'd like to commend everybody who has been contributing positively to the subreddit, by sharing their builds and game knowledge, answering questions and analysing replays for others, or advertising some underappreciated players and streamers. Although I may not post that much, I use this subreddit now constantly as a source of advice, strategy ideas, and motivation.

Secondly, I'd like to express my concern for a trend that I have noticed over the last few weeks that pertains to [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). While it's encouraged to voice your opinion on something, *please* don't use the downvote arrow solely as an 'I disagree' button.

&gt;Please don't: 
Downvote opinions just because you disagree with them. The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion.

(Quote from the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) outline).

If you read a comment that simply says ""What would you know noob, you're only in Gold league. Get good kid."", downvote away! But if somebody is genuinely posting their opinion, then chances are they are experiencing it in whatever league they play in. Bronze league is a big part of SC2, and any player of any league is entitled to discuss game balance, because everybody is affected by changes to the game. Don't slam somebody and downvote their post, respond with a polite correction or addition and move along!

These are the last 17 TvZ's I played on the NA ladder. I included losses. I basically do the same thing every time, opening reactor hellions, even on large maps like Daybreak. It seems to be working very well for me, as I have a 76% win rate (13W-4L) in this replay pack alone. 

The most recent game was a win vs Minigun's zerg, which I am very proud of. But it just goes to show that this aggressive style can work against even high GM players.

Feel free to ask me any questions or discuss the strategies in this thread, I'll be looking through it often to respond!

Good luck, and I hope it helps at least one person improve their TvZ.

1340926586.0,18,self.AllThingsTerran,vrnp9,[D] Supply drop gasless FE build,Drabzalver,34,16,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/vrnp9/d_supply_drop_gasless_fe_build/,"Okay, this might seem weird at first but let's introduce with a bit of theory, basically we have two things, supply drop, and MULE. A lot of people will tell you that a MULE is always better unless you get supply blocked because a MULE gives you 270 minerals, a supply drop only 100. However it's far more nuranced. A MULE let's you mine an aditional 3 minerals per second for the next 90 seconds. It doesn't give you 270 minerals at all. Supply drop actually gives you 100 minerals, what's more, supply drop gives you 100 minerals _in the past_, it means you had 100 minerals more to work with 30 seconds earlier, also, you save about 30 minerals from an SCV not mining over those 30 seconds.

Point is, there is inflation in SC2, minerals become worth less and less as the game goes on, the 50 minerals you start with are invaluable, later on, 50 minerals don't mean anything to you. The 100 minerals supply drop gives you in the past may in fact be worth more than the 270 minerals a mule gives you over time in some cases. That is why I sort of started to experiment with this build order:

- 10 depot
- 13 rax (you can go 12 if you want, I scout after depot so it ends up 13 for me unless I cut scvs shortly. You also don't need marines quickly so you delay an scv of the line for a moment if you go 13)
- 16 OC (whenever rax finishes, standard stuff, there is no reason to ever cut scv production with this build to get an earlier OC, your OC will always finish in time for the supply drop to not get blocked and you're not rushing the OC to get an earlier mule).
- 2 marines
- as soon as OC finishes, drop supply on your initial depot
- at 400 minerals, second CC.

Essentially the build is a T extractor trick if you will, you sac some money in the long run to get an earlier CC with this build. I typically (with a very early worker scout because that is how I roll) get a CC at 3:55 if I do a standard gasless FE, with this build, I get it at 3:25.

The further beauty of this build is how well it fits, my second CC finishes pretty much exactly when I would get supply blocked because it's slightly earlier than when I would use a mule because I didn't have to invest 100 minerals into the second depot before I start my second CC. So I'm staying on 1 and only 1 supply depot for a very long time where I would be heaving 3 if I didn't use supply drop meaning those minerals can go elsewhere. Together with the two scvs not mining this results into about a 260 minerals gain versus the 270 mule, except that it doesn't dissapear from my patches and I have the money earlier, I however have 8 less supply available so I have to make another extra depot later but I can get my infrastructure up much earlier.

The downside of this build is that you cannot wall off with it. Walling off early game as T has numerous benefits, if someone scouts too late you can hide your build, sure, an early wall is often indicative of a gasless FE but for all he knows you're making 2 extra rax behind that or you've taken gas and you're trying to trick him, with this build there's no real way to keep the scouting worker outside of your base. Another thing of course is that you have a depot with a big 'kill me' target on it that will cost you 16 supply when killed.

Another thing is that you may get into your opponent's head, early supply drops are typically indicative of all-in rushes so he might be confused and assume stuff is proxied some-where else because he saw the supply drop in your base.

Discuss.

Edit: A note is that this build is basically optimized to be benificial for my take on gasless FE, this means that if you:

- Like to start the second OC before a second depot (I would not recommend cutting scvs for this as this basically refutes the purpose, you have to cut marines if you want to do that)
- Like to wall off
- Like to scout late rather than early

that the benefits of this little trick really reduce.

Edit2: The general idea can also be adapted to various other builds, I like doing it with a reaper expand for instance which does per se need 2 depots before you start your expo. The general idea of the strategy is just to exchange your second depot for a supply drop. With almost all builds which involve a relatively quick expansion this will lead to a quicker CC at the price of a mule.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,1340944673.0,,,True,t3_vrnp9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/vrnp9/d_supply_drop_gasless_fe_build/,

I think it's unfair to us how if we can't win in the beginning then we have a serious disadvantage against toss. Even Blizzard themselves have said that Toss is weaker in the early game and stronger in the lategame.

The problem is though, most of the time Terran doesn't win in the first 12 minutes.

On tvz, i think it's unfair that fungals requires waaaay more skill to counter them then it does to use them.

I know what to do in both situations; move away. Problem is, no matter how good I seem to split or move out of storms, I always still seem to lose my entire army.

My question is: How do you deal with storms?

I had a game recently (no replay, sorry) against P that rushed to HTs with storm. Even though I identified it and got ghosts, I could do nothing about it. As soon as a storm was dropped, I moved back out of it but it always seemed to do massive amounts of damage, bringing my units to very low health even though I reacted immediately. As soon as I stop to fight again, they would drop another one, and I would have to move again. I basically never got an opportunity to fight their army because I was constantly moving out of storms. I would have stutter stepped it, but I was already nearly dying just from moving out of storms so wanted to minimise the damage. All I could do was gg and think to all the times I have watched pro streams (like demuslim, which I watch very often) and all the times I have seem him just stand in storms and still kill the enemy, seemingly taking no damage.

Also, when using ghosts vs. Protoss, should I go for landing on as many EMPs on the army as I can, or sniping HTs. Every time I go for EMPs, they seem to do nothing to help me/take energy off HTs. Every time I decide to snipe, I can never see the HTs in the protoss death ball to hit, or they are so far to the back that I can't get ghosts close enough.

As has been mentioned previously, we're making a separate, updating thread for people who are streaming.  In it, people can post their streams, and any relevant information.  A general format suggestion is:

------------------------------

Name - League - Link  
Online: [yes/no]  
Summary/music style/commentary/extra info

-----------------------------------------

For the sake of consistency, we ask that you stick as close to this format as possible.  Also, be sure to edit the thread both before and after you stream to show whether you're on or offline.  People who habitually leave themselves as offline 24/7 will be warned, and can have their posts removed.

Second, we're making a separate thread for coaching.  The current subreddit rule of only posting coaching once per coach was put in place when the community was much, much smaller.  Now that the front page changes fairly frequently, it means that those coaching links are quickly buried.  So we're setting up a weekly thread for it, with the same rules and general format as the streaming one.

We also ask that in regards to the streaming and coaching threads, **please do not downvote anybody's submission**.  There are going to be people who you like and dislike, but that should not mean that you actively try to take away from their ability to have fun and play the game just like anyone else.  If you'd like to upvote a streamer that you particularly love, that's awesome, but please keep negativity out of these threads.  Posting critiques of coaching is fair game as long as it is done respectfully, but comments bashing the streams of other players *will* be removed from these threads.

Finally, we've made a general discussion thread, which is just a casual place to hang out and talk about anything that you don't really think deserves its own submission.  It doesn't even have to be SC2 related; just show up and shoot the breeze with some fellow Terrans.

All of these threads can be found under the ""Weekly Threads"" section of the sidebar, along with the days that they are updated.  All updates are done using the mods' shared account, so if you have any issues, comments, or suggestions concerning the updating threads, feel free to message us about them at any time.

Other than that, we're all enjoying our holidays, and we hope you are too.

Like all strategies it does have its weakness's (1 base blink obs/early colossus timings) but it for the most part is very solid and i hope this helps some of you with your TvP!

I recently noticed a lot more thread about new player looking for help, probably due to the fact that starcraft was on sale at 20$ recently.
In all of those thread, I replied telling them that I would be happy to help them by giving them pointers and just overall critique of their play. 

Sadly, none of them ever follow through with contacting me to receive the help.

This kind of make me sad, since I'm always happy to help newer player get into the game.

I remember when I was an annoying 7 years old kids, and people on BW would help me learn the game and show me some strategy. Nowadays, if you want people to do that, you need to pay for it. Altruism and philanthropy have basically disappeared from the internet.

I decided to lead by example and make this thread to invite newer player to contact me via reddit if they need some help in starcraft. I'm only a platinum player, but I'm sure I can help some people out there who are lost in this cold dark place that is the battle.net ladder.

I hope I'll get a lot of reply :)",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,,True,t3_14u28m,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/14u28m/philanthropist_looking_for_people_to_help/,
1354901249.0,16,self.AllThingsTerran,14gaqs,"Pitching an idea, want to gauge interest.",Thorania,17,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/14gaqs/pitching_an_idea_want_to_gauge_interest/,"**Jump to the bottom for the TL;DR version**, but I feel like I should start with some background information before I get into the meat of what I'm thinking about doing. Previously I was a mid masters (bouncing between 18th - 28th place in masters) as Terran. Because of School, other commitments and TvZ generally being very hard I dropped into diamond. I want to get back into masters pretty badly, this game is my passion and it makes me feel like nothing else - I don't particularly find it fun, but rather I find it challenging and engaging like nothing else, furthermore; while I've been at school I've been separated from a lot of my 'StarCraft friends'. Many of my close friends play and I've always found it lovely to discuss the game, talk out our problems, watch each others replays and generally help everyone improve symbiotically. 

I know I should be watching my replays of lost games where I don't know why I lost, and knowing this is great in theory, however; I'm sure I'm not the only one that skips analyzing their mistakes and in exchange for the ability to play more games during the finite amount of time we as people have. I also tend to like helping people with things, but in this case I don't feel I have the game knowledge to instruct others fully so I decided to combined these two or three problems I'm having into one comprehensive solution. 

Basically here's my idea: I make a series (or at least make a pilot to gauge interest) Where I look at a replay of a game where I lost, compare it to a game where I did a similar build on the same map and won or to a similar pro game and analyze why I lost. 

**So here's the important questions:**

**Q.** How does this help me?

**A.** When reviewing my games vocally and in front of an audience I'll have less of a tendency to speed through the replay or not watch it at all. I'll have to actually review my mistakes and I can learn from them better. 

**Q.** How does this help you?

**A.** Lower league players can learn from the builds, and understand the fact that we all truly suck. Also it may be entertaining who knows?!

**Q.** What about people better than me who watch it?

**A.** I want players better than me to watch it simply so they can rip me a new asshole for lack of a better term. While lower league players can learn from my mistakes or builds higher league players can comment on what's going on and thusly everyone will learn from the conversation...in theory.

**Q.** Why?

**A.** Because I think StarCraft is fucking fantastic and I love talking about it and getting demoted sucks, and I'd prefer to get back into masters where I believe I belong.



**TL;DR Considering making a series where I review my replays and use insight from the community to improve so I can suck less and get back into masters.**


Also on an additional note I haven't made videos in a long time, however; I have streamed with multiple scenes on xsplit numerous times so I know how that works. I'd be grateful for any advice on producing content for efficiently, so if you have any please do tell.


edit: Spelling and stuff.

First, I want to say thanks to all those who commented in the live discussion thread during the Code S finals. That was a lot of fun!

My next idea is fairly simple, and I believe it will be extremely fun and informative for Terran players of all skill levels.

For the weekly **Terran Master Class** I'll choose a replay/VOD of a pro Terran player for our community to analyze. I'll create the Master Class thread, and then all members of the community are welcome to provide analysis **OR** ask good questions about the game. Community members are encouraged to debate points made in the thread if they disagree. 

### Previous Master Class Discussions

[Taeja vs Stephano @Dreamhack Valencia](http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/121eko/terran_master_class_teaja_vs_stephano_dreamhack)

### A good analysis comment

A good analysis comment is short and to the point. The overall goal of this project is to provide small, digestible insights that we can apply to our own games. Feel free to break up your analysis into multiple comments if the topics differ enough.  If the VOD has a caster in it, don't just bring up something they said (unless you disagree with it, of course!). 

### What days will this happen?

I'm planning on creating the thread every Wednesday evening (US time). Since /r/AllThingsTerran is a relatively small subreddit, I imagine the thread will be up near the top until Thursday afternoon or so. 

### Can I recommend a replay/vod?

Sure! PM me.

I destroyed enough probes (I think 40ish) and pylons to have him capped. 

picked up my 3 remaining medvacs, moved them back to my base. He was kinda forced to do an all in, lost my natural but at this point had 3 other expos. Barely survived but I had enough production buildings to get a quick army to finish him off.

If they tech up to ultras, keep your tanks unsieged! The splash doesn't matter against ultras (it will only hit one) and unsieged tanks do more damage against single targets. 

* Unsieged tanks are weak against zerglings, but if you keep a healthy number of hellions with your army, you should be fine.
* You can use your new mobile force to go snipe hatcheries.

The key points: 

1) Only the refinery needs to be rushed as soon as possible. The depot and the barracks don't need to be started for a while - if they are built as soon as possible the rax will wait ~10-15 seconds until there is enough gas, wasting time. 

2) Consequently, start the depot when an scv becomes available to do so without moving at all to begin work. 

3) Don't send the first scv we build to proxy. Send an scv a little before the second one completes, or even (as seen in my replay), send the second scv to build the rax. The later the proxy worker goes, the more minerals are mined and the sooner there's enough for the refinery to be started. 

4) Preemptively send a worker to the geiser so as to begin construction as soon as possible. If 50 minerals are banked, it is imperative to send a worker momentarily. 

5) Preemptively send workers into gas a little before the gas completes. Demuslim does this and the previous very important two points perfectly, and pros benefit from getting gas asap in all their builds, literally every delayed second of doing these translates into a lost second of building whatever gas things one goes for. 

6) Stacking workers on the near mineral fields helps, but done with care, trying to relocate workers so that they begin work as soon as they hit the mineral patch (rather than having to spam right click force them there, losing mining time). 

Obviously, attacking 5-10 seconds earlier is a pretty huge deal for such an early rush. ",,False,self,t5_2tfht,1370539500.0,,icon-rank-diamond,True,t3_1fsgia,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1fsgia/the_226_reaper/,

The mod team's been talking about it, and while we definitely like the fact that you guys are so excited to help people out, we want to find a more clean and efficient way for that to happen.  The method we've decided to go with (and one that has been suggested by you guys many times in the past) is to have a thread dedicated to promoting streams.  I'll post the first thread this coming Wednesday, and depending on feedback from the community, we'll have follow up threads somewhere between every week, and every month.  The thread will be linked in the sidebar for ease of access.

As a reminder, while coaching posts are allowed in the subreddit, each person is only allowed to advertise themselves once.  If the streaming thread ends up working well, we'll likely implement the same thing for coaching, but as it stands now, we ask that you respect the rules as they are.

And finally, for those of you badass enough to have fought your way to Grand Masters, we now have flair for you!  Thanks to CrunchFlakes for making that happen.

If you have any comments/concerns/criticisms, of both the new rules and anything in general, feel free to post them here.  We do our best to make this place awesome for you all, and we love hearing what you think would make this place even better.

Also a complete misunderstanding of what mech play is by some, it does NOT mean using mechanical units and a moving, in fact it has nothing to do in a general sense with mechanical units, it just so happens terran uses this style and happens to use it with mechanical units. This is an easy mistake to make,however, and is understandable. What it does mean, however, is slow methodical and mechanical play with a lot of psychological exchanges between players going on (see Yomi). Also something I thought people knew about mech play (from broodwar) was the fact that you should only seige about 30% of your tanks in positions that if say a zerg chose to attack and then the majority are unseiged at a midway point so that if he attacks a positon you move the bulk of your army there while the ones there are used to delay so you can get a good POSITION against the attack since terran units power comes from POSITION. This is part of why mech play is so interesting and should be made viable in all matchups. 


For more information, and because others can explain much better, that you should definitely know as a terran player or starcraft player in general watch LastShadow's vblog, I'm tired of having arguments with people about this kind of stuff when they clearly do not know what they are talking about.

I play mainly Protoss, and I've only been drone rushed twice, and both times I was fine just by microing to get shields back and not being stupid.  When I play Terran though, I seem to get drone rushed more often, and I just don't know how to beat the damn strategy, I've lost to it like 3 times in the last 2 days.

I understand my advantage -- I have 1 or 2 extra workers and if I can hold him off with even a single worker left I should have an economic advantage.  But it seems like Drones beat SCVs, like microed Probes beat Drones.

With Protoss I pull all probes to deal with it, but it seems to me like even microed SCVs lose to microed Drones, so my only hope would be to produce 1-2 extra SCVs on top of my existing advantage, which requires not lifting off the CC, which gives the drones a handy way to force me to attack into them by attacking my CC.  Eventually I just run out of minerals this way.  If I try to keep a couple of SCVs mining I'm at a numerical disadvantage and lose that way.

The fact that it comes before my 9-scout makes it even worse, but even if I knew it was coming from the first moment the game, I can't see how I win -- there isn't enough time to block off the ramp unless I use my CC and long-distance mine, but that's contingent on knowing it's coming.  Pulling all SCVs, lining them up and hold-positioning them at the top of the ramp seems like giving the zerg exactly what he needs to kill me.  Do I save 50 minerals, block the ramp and just land the CC somewhere else?

I do pretty well with Terran in the midgame, so I'm not a total moron, but I've watched the replays, theorycrafted, and I just don't see how I win this unless I have vastly superior worker micro, and someone who drone-rushes regularly is pretty naturally going to have better worker micro than someone who never worker rushes.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,,True,t3_zs149,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/zs149/this_is_embarassing_but_how_the_do_i_beat_a_drone/,

Well my solution has been avoiding an end game where the Protoss has been able to macro up properly.

Current metagame in PvT is going to be 1 gate expo (or some variant of this).  So what I've been doing to counter this is go for a 12/14 barracks expand, and do a mini SCV-marine attack at right around 6 minutes.  This is before warpgate is finished, and before gates 2 and 3 will be done.  Put down a forward bunker, take out some probes, and if all goes well, kill the expansion.  Back off, and your expand is already up and you take advantage into the mid game.

**Basic build order:**

* 10 supply
* 12 rax
* 14 rax (hidden from your opponent)
* 16 OC
* 17 supply

* Put down CC when minerals allow (while keeping up marine/scv/supply depot production)

* Take Xel'Naga with first 4-5 marines.  Bring up other 4-5 marines, hit with 10~ marines and 2-3 SCVs right around 6:00 mark.

Attached are a couple of replays (one where I outright win with the build order, other one where it goes into a 15~ minute game).

Note:  If you scout your opponent not going for a 1 gate expand, the attack can still be successful if you completely deny scouting.  Otherwise it is safer to call off the attack and be prepare to defend.

As before, I was wondering if I could get some feedback from this awesome community on the same things. Feel free to comment either right here or on the website itself, for I'll check both of them.

* How do you like the layout on the page (ignore the web design itself - focus on the ordering/layout of the contents of a build order)?
* Is there any information that you think is wrong?
* When you look for a new build, are you looking for more information than is currently provided?
* How do you like the ""tutorial"" feature (they're just a collection of games vs a very easy AI where I perform the build perfectly with minimal micro)?
* What other builds am I missing to cover all of TvZ? (I didn't include TLO's classic 6rax on one base and other cheeses like cloaked banshee because you don't really see them anymore)
* Any other random comments/concerns/questions are totally awesome to hear too!

Pulling SCVs to tank / repair the Hellions is also an option and only makes your push that much stronger. 

If Zerg takes a third in reaction, you should be in good shape even if he attempts to go Roach/Baneling all in after that. However, if he stays agressive on two base, bunker up and prepare to pull SCVs.

I know the theory of how terran should win this matchup. Quick medivacs for drops while you get your third up and upgrades and more rax and stuff. But I still lose no matter what when toss decides they have enough warpins to hold drops and a moves my base. terran must exert all this energy and micro to even tread water in this matchup while toss sits on his ass and makes splash units. 

I'm not writing this to whine, I am genuinely trying to get better, and I want some discussion on how a terran should theoretically play out this matchup. What should the concrete goals be in each stage of the game assuming a fast expand into quick medivacs? (this is the build i'm set on right now). How does each goal ultimately link up into the next and to victory in the end? Am i supposed to just accept that terran units are just worse at combat than protoss, and I should always have to bust my ass trying to split up the protoss army?? And if so, is this not definitive proof that protoss is easier? 

Again, not saying these things to whine, I just want answers, because I believe they must exist. 

TL;DR

I'd love some discussion on the general theory of toss versus terran.

People compare them to burrowed banelings saying theyre more expensive but do WAY more damage which is true until you factor in that banelings can be used offensively as well, dont do friendly splash damage and do their damage immediately

Sometimes there are some skirmishes or drops along the way, but as far as TvP is concerned I can stay even with a protoss until maxed-out, fully upgraded, high tech armies against other players in my league. (Gold League)


The games inevitably lead to a point where I, with bio, ghosts, and vikings, will fight an army with colossus, high templar, zealots, and archons. This is where the game ends in a matter of seconds every time, with the protoss losing almost no units and requiring almost no micro on their part. This isn't a balance whine, but I lack a fundamental understanding of how to engage a composition like this.

People will say things like ""EMP duh"" or whatever, but I feel like it should be possible to do this without having to perfectly blanket every ounce of the protoss army in one of the hardest to cast spells in the game. 

My first question is, where do you engage in this situation? Some maps don't have convenient choke points (Akilon Flats for example). For that map specifically, the only thing I can think of is fighting at your natural ramp or lifting your 3rd base and fighting in the space where it was to get a good position. Is there some theory as far as where to have your vikings relative to the rest of your army? What units are supposed to be in front? Do you prioritize kiting or just get a spread and stand still?

Secondly, is there any way to practice against this without spending 20 minutes building up your army, only to lose it in less than a minute?

The Build:

10 Depot

12 Barracks

12 Gas

15 OC

Reaper 

Take one worker out of gas

Reactor on Barracks

CC

Depot

Factory (make one mine) + Reactor Marines

Take second gas after starting Factory, and put all workers back in gas

OC

Armory @100% Factory

Starport @ 100 gas

Swap Factory onto Reactor to make 2 Hellbats at a time

Tech Lab on Rax right after taking it off Reactor and start Stim

Make 2 Medivacs and start dropping

Add Reactor on Starport

~8:00 put down a third CC

~8:25 put down 2 Rax (1 Tech Lab, 1 Reactor)

Put down 2 Engi Bays right after these 2 Barracks as soon as you can afford to

Take third and fourth gases

When the second and third Barracks finish, add two more (both with Tech Labs)

At this point, try to scout for either Colossus tech or Templar Tech. If Colossus, start making Vikings

Around 11:00~11:30 take fifth and sixth gases and add a second Starport

At ~12:30 start pressuring
_______________________________________________________________________________________

This build allows to you start attacking the Protoss with +1/+1 on your Bio, as well as +1 Armor on your Hellbats and Vikings/Medivacs. It really punishes a greedy quick three base/double Forge style.

For me, I have found this build to be good against greedy three base or double forge openers with either Colossus or Templar tech. The only things that have ever really slowed me down were Immortal all ins or Void Ray all ins, but I am sure those are stoppable as well with proper scouting and preparation.

Pressure is key here. You need to do a good amount of damage with this, because this doesn't really transition all that well into the late game, especially if they are able to get ahead in upgrades and get a good amount of Archons up.

As a new player who doesn't want to get ridiculized in multiplayer I spend most of my free time reading forum (liquid, reddit), I've also watch all the filtersc and apollo tutorials. 

The thing I want to ask you is : Is Terran really that difficult compare to other races ? Especialy on TL's forum, every Terran's thread you can read about how micro and macro are difficult as Terran, positioning, decision making ....

I'm completly aware as an ""old"" guy I'll never be able to compete with teens and 20s so if you add to this a more difficult race I'll never be able to go out of low bronze :p

On an other topic : when do you think coaching is usefull ? As I understand till gold all you need to do is scv and supply...but maybe a litle help regarding BO or position can be usefull for me!

I am currently low-masters in WoL and high-diamond in HotS (playing mostly masters players).I had made a topic about this same build earlier in the week, but I've had much more practice with it now and believe I have a semi-optimal build order for it and many more replays. The idea of this build is to open up with a fast reaper  (**DO NOT LET THIS REAPER DIE**) in order to get scouting information while you take a second command center, then to push out with 2 mines and a handful of marines/marauders around 7:30 (this could probably be more optimized by better players) to deny the zerg third while stim/starport/engi bay and a 3rd cc get produced, then transition into basic marine tank and macro into victory. Widow mines are extremely good at denying zerg bases early (and can be somewhat useful later)., and can easily hold off any early aggression or all-ins if used  correctly. 
(All these games were played around a low masters/high diamond level)



Replay 1: TheMetal vs [NASL]MrBitter (He said it was real, not sure though)

http://drop.sc/304578  
I start this game with my standard reaper fe opening. I use the reaper to cause some minor economic damage, but most importantly the scouting information I get from it tells me that there is no sort of pressure/all-in which makes it safe to do the 7:30 push. With the push, I'm able to force a cancel on his building hatchery, and I place a widow mine under it for annoyance and so I know when he decides to retake the third. After denying the third I sit at the watchtower to keep an eye out for any pressure - the zerg sends out a reasonably large ling force, but my mines, marines and marauder easily clean it up. The game then transitions to a 3 base marine tank push which ends the game thanks to tanks and marine splits vs ling/baneling(I fucked up on the ling run-bys and responded very poorly, which put me father behind than I should have been. On a more positive note, because of how Antiga is designed, it's very easy to take the gold base early using marine/tank which helps increase any economic lead exponentially)



Replay 2: TheMetal vs Lampan

http://drop.sc/304579  
Again I use the reaper fe opening into the marine/marauder/mine push. I made a very very bad mistake in letting my reaper die at the start, which set me behind for the rest of the game. The 7:30 push in this game worked extremely well and allowed me to kill the fast 3rd of the zerg, however I forgot to unborrow my mine and reburrow it under the hatch position to deny it for longer. I then went back to the watchtower and defending a ling pressure, but the zreg was making mutalisks at this time and I forgot to scan his bases and it caught me completely off gaurd. The mass mutalisks did an insane amount of damage due to my lack of scouting, and set me too far behind economically to come back. However had I scouted the mutas, I could have easily dropped multiple missile turrets to defend each base and macro up enough to simply overpower the zerg.



Replay 3: TheMetal vs Faust

http://drop.sc/304580  
Standard reaper fe into the 7:30 push. The zerg took a greedy early third and I was able to kill it, after which the zerg Idra-quit. Not much else to say about this game, it just made me laugh.



Replay 4: TheMetal vs Fatyeti

http://drop.sc/304581  
Reaper fe into 7:30 push. Because I lost my reaper, I didn't see the roach/ling pressure coming and lost my first hitsquad. With the mines and bunker at my natural, I was able to easily fend off the pressure and kick the zerg back to his side of the map. Once I felt confident in my army size, I pushed up to the watchtower in order to gain map control. Around this time I took a few small engagements that ended pretty favorable for me thanks to stim and combat shields. Once I started getting some tanks out, I took a third base and dropped a fourth cc. I actually scouted the mutas this game and was able to drop missile turrets at each base greatly limiting the amount of damage they did. I also made a few thors because fuck mutas ^_^. Then I took the gold base and again took the xel'naga and gained map control. The zerg ninjad the 8 o'clock base, which took me longer to notice than It should have. The zerg than engaged onto my army with muta/ling/bling, but my marine/tank/thor destroyed the zerg army. After a few small engagements, I noticed the ninja base and went to kill it. The zerg tried to catch my unites at his hidden expo, but my thor tanked almost all the banelings allowing the marines and marauders to kill the lings and mutas. At this point I just doom-pushed and won the game.



Replay 5: TheMetal vs [904]iPTunK

http://drop.sc/304582  
Reaper fe opening. However this zerg has some sort of mental disorder and was trying to do some sort of 1 base roach-ling play. I scout this and drop a bunker on the highground, nullifying it completely. After checking my natural, I burrowed a few mines and expanded. I then did the 7:30 push, the zerg had no third so I burrowed a widow and pushed into the natural to get some scouting information. I saw a shitton of lings and roaches and decided to backoff and quickly finish my depot wall at my nat to fend off any incoming pressure. At around 11 minutes I begin to get scared and scan his base, I see a finishing bling nest and roach warred, so I was assured there would be no mutas and simply pushed out and took my third with the use of siege tanks. I tried to push out but got caught in a terrible position by the zerg army. The one tank, however, sieged up in the little crevice next to the destructible rocks prevented the zerg from walking into my nat and killing me off completely. The zerg then pushed out witha  sizable roach/ling/bling force and killed my third command center because I accidentally started a scv instead of lifting it off. This was a major mistake and turned what was an easy win into an extremely close game. I was able to kcik the zerg out and retake my third base. I pushed out with a small army to check for a zerg fourth, which was non-existant. My army got caught here but I was able to make my unites pretty cost effective thanks to splits and siege tanks. Once I had 8 tanks, I felt comfortable taking a fourth base and being able to defend it. The bling ultra army at this point was getting scary, so i dropped 5 more tech labs to increase marauder production. I ended up doing a doompush with mostly marauders and tanks and winning the game.


The basic build order is:

10 depot

12 rax

13 gas

15 oc

15 reaper (skip marine) 

~18 cc(2)

~20 fact

~23 barracks(2) &amp; tech lab on barracks(1) (Start stim once finished)

~24 bunker at nat

~7:30 push out with 2 mines, 2 marauders and a handful of marines

	=&gt; drop starport, engibay, more gasses, third cc during push

I hope this can help some of the players who are feeling a little bit down on TvP, as there's really nothing worse than losing a 20 minute game and your whole army in a 15 second fight.

First, a little bit about the matchup generally. 

Standard play for Protoss against Terran right now is a 1-gate expand. What can change a little bit is the combination of early gateway units produced and where the gas, cybercore and chronos fit in. Most of the time, you'll then see Toss transition into Colossi and take a third. Then they'll use that gas to add on high Templar and anchors, maybe start using DT's for harass and begin to get the more expensive upgrades (2/2, charge, blink). By the lategame, you'll be facing a mixture of all the high tech units and a backbone of high-health zealots. 

As Terran, standard is the 1 Rax FE, into a 10:00 timing push with +1 and medivacs. Then you take a third, add more infrastructure and try to deny the protoss third. This can vary  You win by killing his splash damage -- sniping HTs with ghosts or colossi with vikings, or both -- then dancing your marines over the super-weak gateway ball beneath all the shiny stuff. The ultimate army you want to get to is about 15 ghosts, 12 vikings, and the remainder about 1:1 marines marauders and a decent number of medivacs.

So the actual game:

You want to scout to find any deviation from standard play and determine a response. For example, if you're planning on 1 Rax Feing, and the nexus is already down when your 13-14 scout gets to the toss' base (nex first), you can rule out early pressure and transition into a 3 OC build or an all in if you want.

If you scout 2 gasses, then there's going to be some kind of aggression with better units. That can be viodrays, sentries, blink stalkers, DT's or immortals. You'll want to adjust your build to be more defensive. Do this by adding more techlabs to your initial rax and building bunkers. Marauders do well against the majority of all ins (obviously, if it's a VR all in build enough marines to shoot up)  If your opponent hasn't expanded, you can cut some SCV's to build more unit within reason and still be ahead).

If there's no all-in, you should start setting up for the 10:00 or so aggression. You can put yourself in the best position by shifting your build order slightly to get infrastructure and upgrades up faster, but that means you're cutting early defense. For example, if you don't see a zealot come out, you can delay your bunker and get your rax up faster.

If you don't think an all-ins coming, you can delay your second gas (popular as bomber's TvP build) and get a rax or CC up faster at the cost of some of those defensive marauders. If you build 5 Rax before your third CC and upgrades, you can get more bio out and try to deny his third for longer. There's countless variations here. Just know if you're scared build marauders and bunkers. If you're confident no attack is coming, build either infrasturcture, upgrades and a faster 3rd CC. 

You should factor the map into this some as well. On maps with more width to approach the third or drop area you can be more aggressive in the midgame, and you might want to go for bomber's build which gives you a better midgame army. Where you can't attack the third too safely, you might want more economy and better upgrades for the lategame. 

Either way, you'll end up fighting the toss. Some tips about that: 

You want to pick a spot to fight where you can concave so more units are firing and your units wont clump up for easy splash damage. You also want to run back with your bio to keep them out of FF and storm range, while separating zealots and stopping them from hitting you. While this happens, you also want to EMP everything and have vikings kill Colossi. If you don't have enough units to eat a couple of storms and enough vikings to kill colo, try to use your troops to stall until you do. 

For god's sake, don't run in and try to snipe a Colossus and lose your whole army. Don't drop unless you have the APM to watch the ship as it goes into the base. Losing a dropship is huge in the midgame. Also, stay at the edge of storm range so you don't get hit by 3 storms at the same time. You can't afford to not know where the toss army is. Send out marines in every direction so you don't get snuck up on and die. 

Practically, you can stop your engagement from being a complete disaster by leaving your army in concaves with vikings on top of bio. Stim, then you can switch to a ghost hotkey and spam EMP. In lower leagues, you can get away with a hotkey for bio, medivacs and vikings and another for ghosts. if you stim, then a move in a concave, then emp shower and cloak, you should trade evenly if you don't get stormed to death. 

You want to adjust the amount of vikings to the number of Colossi you see. Around 12 lets you 1 shot them, but if they've only got like 2 you probably don't need that many. Build ghosts even if they don't built HTs, because EMP and cloak are nice. 

The engagement is still tough, even with the ghost, viking and bio army. Don't force an engagement, and be prepared to kill off lots of warp-ins after the fight. If you can make the toss burn his bank with a huge round of zealots, then you can win after the next engagement.

Hope this helps someone at least. I also hope someone elaborates on some of the things I was saying and makes them more specific. If I'm wrong about something please correct me too. 

**TLDR: Adjust your 1 Rax FE into 1+ 10:00 push with how aggressive or greedy the Protoss' build looks. Then don't get stormed and EMP your way to victory.**

How the heck am I supposed to maintain any sort of map/vision control?  I'm feeling really lost at this point in the match up, and am looking for some advice on ways to beat a zerg.  I really do know my macro can be better, its just I feel so hopeless in this match up, and it feels I play well over 50% vs zerg.  I feel helpless vs a zerg who does anything besides a 6 pool.

EDIT: sorry for the aggro/sarcasm of my first paragraph, just tilting about zerg atm.

EDIT2:  I didn't post any reps because I really want to actually start playing tvz, instead of 11/11 or 3-4 port banshee.

Perhaps an EMP shell upgrade that you can get from say the Fusion Core for example so you couldn't get it immediately. This way it would only affect TvP and make tanks more effective vs Toss units and making the immobile but interesting mech style viable again in TvP and not have to add an op unit like the warhound.

If a little more balance is needed the tanks could charge up and glow blue for a fraction of a second and maybe make a sound if it is too imba so the toss could pull back really fast much like the widow mines which you can react to also. 

Also the tank charging up with a blue green emp glow would be cool. :D

Cherenkov radiation color perhaps.

Another idea thats probably not necessary for TvZ in order to buff the tanks a bit if need vs swarm host etc could be to add a concussive shell upgrade that slows units that get splashed or maybe just hit directly by seige fire. It could come from a higher tier building like the fusion core also or maybe just make the marauder concussive shell upgrade work on tanks, you usually don't get a tech lab on a rax in mech for TvZ so this way like the other idea you probably wouldn't get it immediately. This could affect the other matchups however, perhaps the upgrade for tanks could only effect zerg for some canon reason. 

Hell why not have some incendiary rounds that effect the ground similar to storm but for a bit longer and maybe have a longer cooldown on shots.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,1348190577.0,,,True,t3_1083yd,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1083yd/idea_to_make_mech_style_viable_in_tvp_and_not/,

I'm a platinum player that is currently starting to struggle to win matches as I start playing top 8 plat players.  I've never really dropped my opponents and I think my lack of harass is what is starting to lose me games as my zerg and protoss opponents can build their eco and army up relatively untouched and then roll over me late game.

I know literally how to drop and how to drop whilst moving, but what I can't wrap my head around is when I should drop.  I think I basically lack of the confidence to drop because it leaves my defending army much weaker and I fear counter attacks.

Do you guys have any tips or advice for how to drop effectively please? Should I start dropping with my first two medivacs that pop out? Should I be doing 1 or 2 medivac drops? Will drops only work if I drop at two places at once?  These are all questions that I can't wrap my head around on my own.  I always fear that my drops will be shut down and my army will be left significantly weaker.

* Terran gets a new add-on requiring a Engineering Bay and an Armory that is called a ""Drop Facility"" usable by production facilities. This addon allows units to be produced into a queue (that consumes supply) that can later be called down onto anywhere on the map in range of a Sensor Tower. 
* Terran gets a new add-on requiring a Engineering Bay and an Armory that is called a ""Drop Facility"" usable by production facilities.

* The Shredder is added back in, but can only be used in range of a Sensor Tower as a way to prevent the worker harass that got it cut. Gas cost is reduced commensurately to this requirement. 
* Stim can be upgraded again (it must be research for other units first) to give Reapers stim in the late game.

Sc2 is the first RTS I've ever tried to get in to and I'm really enjoying it! I saw a lot of people around here suggesting filterSC's tutorials so I started with those and battled my way up from the bottom of bronze to top 8 Gold over the last few months. 



I'm still just using the techniques from filters silver league video and I feel like I'm hitting the benchmarks enough to move on to the next one. However, I think I could really use a more general understanding of the game first.



My knowledge of individual units and their strengths and weaknesses is extremely lacking especially when it comes to the other races, and I know absolutely nothing about Zerg or Protoss buildings and what they do, which makes scouting entirely useless against them.



Are there any good resources or videos that just walk through some of these more basic elements? Or is just a case of having to trawl through the blizzard game guide?



Filters tutorials have been amazing so far and they've taken me much higher than I expected, much faster but I'm just building what he tells me to rather than understanding why.



Sorry about the long post! Any advice would be much appreciated :D

I recently made a blog post about the widow mine in TvP and how I don't think it's the panacea of Terran. But I am not one that doesn't least give things a try before writing them off as bad.

Over the past few days I have worked on this build and I haven't lost a single TvP as of yet.

Basic idea:

You open up 13 gas, get 3 marines out of your barracks and then make a reactor after factory -100 gas into expo (this is an oldschool TvZ build, except for the fact that you get widow mines instead of hellions).

You get 3 marines just so you have no problem defending a chrono-boosted zealot poke (happens quite often in HotS). Then you start making 2 widow mines at a time once your factory is complete. You get up to 6 or 8 widow mines and are pretty much safe vs. any kind of all-in, this build also allows you to take a really quick third to make up for your economical loss due to opening up gas instead of a no gas expo.

Take your natural if you feel safe or once you have your first tank, always make sure to have at least 2 widow mines in your main so you are safe vs oracles or warp prisms (you can get a really early engi bay aswell, it really doesn't hurt you). 

You can make lots of command centers even before you are maxed (and remember you don't attack until you are maxed). Make lots of tanks and hellbats, don't make more than 8 widow mines, they only help you survive early game, they aren't very useful in direct engagements, but you can use them to defend expos, ramps or your main base (vs drops or air). Widow mines are excellent units in that regard, they really help you defensively, but I don't think they are very good in direct high supply-engagements (maybe I'm wrong though, I'm not quite sure yet).

At some point you want to add starports if you feel like your economy is good enough, get 1 starport for double vikings and however many starports you can support for BCs.

There are different pushes you can do, you can either push with a maxed tank/hellbat army or you can start transitioning into skymech earlier and push with a tank/hellbat/BC/viking army.

It is important to constantly scan your opponent, you have to be aware of air transitions. In case he transitions into air you can use your tanks to take out expos (and sack them cost efficiently) and mass up a thor/hellbat/viking/raven army to deal with it. This happened before and I actually beat the protoss with HSM/PDD and full upgrades on both mech and air.


Pros:

- safe vs. most all-ins (from what I can tell)

- very strong economy in the midgame

- good flexibility (lots of factories and starports to hard-counter transitions)

- double upgrades

Cons:

- No aggressive potential (pure defense)

- need to scan alot or you might get killed by hidden tech switches

- ???

Anyway, I hope this works out for you guys just as well as it has for me. If there is something about the build that you think I can improve let me know. Let's make mech work guys. :)

1357124192.0,12,self.AllThingsTerran,15tkb0,A discourse on lategame TvP engagements and strategy,PassionOfTHeMoletrap,17,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/15tkb0/a_discourse_on_lategame_tvp_engagements_and/,"It's important to realize there are different flavours of TvP, I have just found this style to work the best for me. TvP is by far my best T matchup and I seldom lose a lategame, the times I lose is usually to all ins. That said:

__General style of engagement__

- Stop kiting beyond a certain point in the game. You often see Terrans kiting and kiting and kiting to the point that it hurts them, yes, zealots are scary and their dps is greatly dimished by kiting. But marines do not have infinite range, the range of a marine is the diametre of a command centre. If you have this huge bio ball and you kite that means that you reduce your own dps just as much if not more because the marines at the end of your ball just aren't firing any more. You don't notice it when you press hold position with your kiting but like half of your ball isn't firing because there's nothing in range to fire at. You can see this by kiting like I kite which is move command backwards, attack command forward. I've just always kited with this method and you can see if you do it like this that the marines in the back start to crabwalk because they have no target in range.

- Arc out your army instead of keeping it into a ball, get a flimsy thin layer of bio, as thin as you can, in a circle around your opponent's army. The theoretically ideal formation would be a complete circle around the protoss army at the right distance where every single one of your units is firing. This ensures that forcefields are less useful, your entire army is firing and when zealots kill one target they take time switching to the next, it also gives you far more freedom to box whatever part of your army is being stormed and move that, and only that away, and because it's so thin, he has to storm his own zealots as well if he wants to storm your army.

- After getting the arc, focus the most on emps, emps are te single most important thing. Splitting, viking control, medivac moving is all second to landing the emps you need. Do not get caught up in the idea that you have to per se save emps for templar or suicide like 10 ghosts just to get the templar, emp actually does damage, carpet the entire army. If emps are at a premium because you don't have many ghosts. Do not focus them on archons. Archons are actually the counter to emp if you don't have _a lot_. Yes, they are almost fully shield but they are also fat and emp is still an AoE. It's like storming thors. Focus emp on zealots in that case. You can easily hit 8 zealots in a giid emp for 400 damage total. You will often hit 1 or 2 archons for 100-200 damage total. a 10 hp archon also deals just as much damage as a 10hp/350sp archon so unless you can actually focus down that last bit of emp, better just make the zealots die quicker which  your army auto targets.

- Do not if at all possible keep your vikings over your army but let them engage from the side, not only will this make it impossible for him to storm both in one go but this will force stalkers into an awkward position.

- Storm is in general scarier than colossi especially in small engagements. Storm is also more fickle. If P is behind, 2 good storms can bring him back in the game. If P is ahead, missing every storm and getting templar emp'd in a clump can turn it around again. Colossi are more stable, do not reward micro as much, and aren't as capable of being outmicroed but in general pretty bad in small armies, they need a huge gateway army to support them. If you can step forward and reach colossi they become worthless and fragile. In general do not attempt to do this unless you know you're going to get it as you often see people losing their entire army over that one prized colossus which survices with 30 hp. In general it's worth it if you think you can finish the colossus in two stutters.

__Before the engagement__

- put marauders in front, this really, really helps. I like to ctrl+click my marauders, stim them and move them towards the opponent before the engagement, this will hopefully bait zealots wasting there charge to which you can pull the marauders back, it puts marauders in front tanking for the more fragile marines and it creates a 'buffer layer' of vacuum, this is important because it makes storming the marines exceedingly diffcult for protoss, approaching templar can easily be focussed down with the marauders

- If at all possible, let protoss come to you. If is far more difficult for Protoss with many melee units to attack into a Terran concave than in reverse. Only if you need to attack for whatever reason and he doesn't want to come then come to him.

- Take any fight where he's misformed. Formation is a lot more important for protoss than it is for Terran. The importance of Zealots in front eclipses the importance of marauders in front. Often if you pulled his army away with some drop and he comes scrambling back to defend a base he is completely out of the proper formation, that is your chance to strike. Protoss needs to properly set up far more direly before a fight than Terran, take advantage.

- Don't lead with this clump of ghosts you sometimes see, it was popular for a while but Protoss learnt to deal with it and you will often get 10 ghosts forcefielded and lasered nowadays. From my experience it stopped working, bait him towards you and then emp all over his army.

__Unit compositions__

- __Vikings__: Be considerate of the amount of vikings you're making, like really considerate. Vikings are an extremely specific unit, they exist to counter a _single_ unit. They are worthless versus everything but that single unit. Every other unit in your arsenal does more than this. It is always better to have 4 vikings too few than the optimal amount (and thus four more medivacs) than four vikings too many (and thus four less medivacs). Do not fall into caveat rules like 'x vikings per colossus', it doesn't work like that. There are _three_ important variables to consider: Colossus count, stalker/zealot ratio, amount of forcefields. Pure marauder/medivac in a good arc against pure stalker/colossus is better than making any vikings. Protoss likes to have zealots, not stalkers in their army against you. In this sense, vikings serve to force stalkers. If he's already overmaking stalkers against your very few vikings then drop viking production. His ground army with all those stalkers instead of zealots is significantly weaker. Though be wary of forcefields as they can completely obliterate this idea if they forcefield you in and laser over you with you having no way to kill the colossi. Punish him by not making enough stalkers and too many zealots by making plenty vikings and flying them in _before_ the engagement and just killing all his colossi and only after that stimming in with your bio and dropping mules over his army. The primay reason he gets stalkers is to avoid this scenario. Zealot/colossus actually rapes you during the engagement even if you have vikings if you are only killing the colossi during the engagement rather than before it.

- __Ghosts__: The single most important lategame unit at your disposal. Colossi are not a counter to ghost, there _is no_ counter to ghosts as far as supply efficiency goes. While there is such a thing as too many vikings or medivacs, there just isn't such a thing as too many ghosts in the lategame because of how little supply they cost for how good they are, they cost the same supply as a marauder, do more dps to zealots than stimmed marauders, cloak, emp, snipe, even nuke. They are simply very good against Protoss. Just get as many ghosts as possible in the lategame when supply becomes the limiting factor and not reapers.

- __Marines or marauders__: There are many schoots of thought on this issue, some people saying you should get pure marines lategame and others saying marines become worthless. I found that  marines are superior to marauders if you play a passive style but with an agressive style marauders become far better. If you let the enemy come to you you want mostly marines, otherwise far more marauders.

- __Vikings or medivacs__: Same story, for a more defensive style you want more vikings and less medivacs, your army is going to be stimming less and you're dropping less. If you're playing a very tempo based style you want to consider not making a lot of vikings at all. I personally play very tempo based in this matchup and vikings just let you lose tempo. If you're forcing him to split his army they also become less valuable.

__Metagame__:

- I tend to classify the start of the lategame when P obtains storm + colossi and 3-3 upgrades for P finish. This is the scariest part for Terran who should be on 2-2 upgrades with 3-3 around 30-50% done.^When you are in this window before you have 3-3. Defend by god defend, do not attack into him. Let him come to you because he has to come to you and do significant damage (and he will if he's as good as you). Get the biggest concave at a key chokepoint and sit there until you have 3-3 and work on growing your ghost count and saccing SCV's and getting macro orbs, as soon as your ghost count starts to increase and your SCV count starts to decrease stuff is only going to get better and better and better for you until Protoss essentially has no chance any more if you control your ghosts properly. If he doesn't come to you in this window and you sustain no damage you've essentially win bar your own screwups. Because ghosts are so massable and supply efficient you will eventually just get a ridiculously cost efficient army which he can't beat, remax with warpgates or no remax.

- You will never be able to be cost efficient against Protoss with bio, if both control properly, if you have the same army value he will win. If you could win with the same army value the matchup would be highly Terran favoured. Protoss needs to invest more into tech which cuts into army value. (Like, there is no 200/200 costing range upgrade for vikingsm, emp does not cost 200/200 to research) as well as that Terran has more potential to do damage to Protoss in the midgame than in reverse. If the game is even at any point, in general Terran simply will have a more expensive army.

- Don't drop if you can walk. I'm seeing a lot of people load up in medivacs just because they can, walking somewhere is actually a lot better, only drop if where you want to be has no path for walking. Dropping is pretty risky.

- There are certain styles where they forgo AoE and tech and stay on pure gateway for a long time even without storm. Pure gateway with adept forcefielding is cost efficient against even stim and medivacs provided that they are constantly aggressive (or you are) and constantly trade to keep army sizes low, in large armies it doesn't fly any more. So play a bit more defensively against it but be wary of the mass expand that typically comes with it. With this style they tend to want to swarm you and just grossly outproduce you with a more mobile but less cost efficient army than the typical protoss army.

- Don't timing push a protoss who has a lot of sentires to defend that, that he made that many sentries means the push has done its damage and delayed the tech before it even started, do not lose your army to the sentry count, scare him a lot, expand and go home.

__Experimental strats__

- Lategame reapers, I sometimes use these in my main army when I arrive at the point I have 300 minerals and 2k gas banked, they pack quite a puch versus zealots and are great expansion harass, they just build slowly.

- Lategame banshees, I also sometimes go for lategame banshees in my composition. They require more infrastructure than vikings but they do more dps versus colossi and tank more stalker damage, they just don't  have the range, also, they cloak.

- Lategame ravens, I sometimes experiment with lategame raven h arass when I'm swimming in gas just for dropping auto turrets at expansions mainly and PDD in fights, I also like to lay down a layer field fo auto turrets before I force the protoss to engage, it seriously fucks up zealot AI.

I know most of you are probably tired of the various links where us low leagues ask for help, however I do believe that I know what my problem is and could use some tips to combat these bad habits that I tend to do.

I haven't played Starcraft 2 much maybe a total of 100 Multiplayer games but have played WC3 competitively and managed to get Diamond with Zerg. However I disliked the Zerg lategame comps with Ultra or BL. Ultras felt to clumsy and BL have no mobility. 

So I switched to T and I am loving it. However I am having a hard time macroing due to bad habits from WC3. I tend to micro heavily in battles and get tunnel vision and my macro/multitasking suffers.

I don't care about strategies at the moment I am just playing Marine/Tank in every matchup and trying to crush everyone with my macro.

Does anyone have any tips to avoid getting tunnelvision and macroing during battles. Whole game I mumble ""macro up, macro up"" in my head but once a skirmish starts that goes down the drain. Below is a replay for anyone interested in helping me out.

* Since the removal of the Warhound, do you find the game has become more interesting and less one dimensional?

* TvP, describe this to me? Can you still play pure bio as if its WoL, and just have to worry about the addition of oracles and tempest for the most part? Does it still have all the same strengths and weakness? Does Protoss going Stargate detract from their ability to hold things like the 10:30 +1? Is 1-1-1 impossible due to the Oracle? Do Protoss players even USE stargate past perhaps an oracle? If you played BW, does Widowmine/Hellion/Tank play a lot like BW mech? Do you even USE widow mines, and if not, what makes it viable to mech in HotS over WoL?

* TvZ, I notice a lot of streamers go mech. Now I have seen that Battle Hellions need almost no micro and just plain slaughter zerglings in a straight up fight, but given that the Viper can reduce the range (thus the power) of mech, is it really viable into the lategame?

* TvT, buisness as usual? Is there a lot of timings where you can theoretically just lose everything to some widow mines? Do Widow Mines + Scan negate Banshee play almost entirely? Are battle hellions worth it in the matchup at all considering Terran has no melee units? Do Widow Mines make bio play terrible, or at least, shred marines?

On paper it sounds rather fantastic to a newbie player like me:

* Can hop ledges and cliffs.
* Does extra damage against buildings (removed in HoTs beta).
* Does extra damage against light armor (i.e. workers).
* Moves at a fairly brisk pace.
* 5 ranged attack.
* Fairly good attack speed.
* Made from Barracks (I'm thinking this is a plus, simply because it's a production building Terrans will be putting down in all games anyways).

So clue in the clueless, please. Is it that Reapers have such measly hp? Is it that it requires too much gas?

I just started to wonder this as I was watching some HoTs changes and saw that Reaper is receiving a passive out-of-combat HP regen in beta in lieu of bonus dam to buildings.

I've got some good feedback for these graphic posts that made me want to contribute more to the ATT and help pulling you up the ladder! All feedback is always welcome and don't be afraid to ask if I left something answered that bothers you.

&gt;Keep in mind that if you are looking for help with a specific game, I most likely don't have time to analyze more than one replay. If you are looking for help with specific matchup, you can post as many replays as you want. I'll look through all of them and try to sum up all the important things in one post.

Things to note:

* I try to avoid all that ""macro better"" stuff, because I think it's pretty useless thing to say. Even I at masters have to work on my macro so it has to be clear that you need to focus on making workers/depots/units all the time. I'll note if you have huge delays with your production, but I try not to be picky about that. I know you can work those things out by yourself :)

* I do my best to build the response around your current skill level based on your league (post your league if I can't see it from your flair). That means I don't focus on your banshee micro or whine about one or two workers idling for some time if it's clear that you don't have multitasking/micro skills etc. needed for doing that. I try to focus on stuff that you should fix to get promoted before next season!

* You can always come back to this thread if you feel like you've done your best at fixing your weakness but are still getting owned for some reason. I'll post another analyze so you know if you've made progress or not and what needs to be fixed. :)

1337474489.0,13,self.AllThingsTerran,tvdwm,Some general Terran strategy queries I would love to see answered,lilstove,15,2,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/tvdwm/some_general_terran_strategy_queries_i_would_love/,"Hello all!
Considering how much this subreddit has grown recently, I thought it would be a good time to throw around some general queries I have in regards to terran strategy. While I plan on adding more later once I get a response, here are the first of several:

1) My first question is in regards to rally points, I tend to rally all unit producing structures to a point either in or just outside my base, and than shift-cue from that point to a unit in my army (preferably a sturdier one, tanks, thors,
battle cruisers, and the like), which constantly streams units to my army, unless said unit dies. If that is the case they will than revert back to the original rally point just outside my main, instead or remaining next to their structures or rallied to their death somewhere on the map where I have potentially just lost an engagement.     

That being said, I have often been told that this system is flawed in that it takes too much time, and is generally less efficient when compared to simply staying on top of rallies and changing them depending on scenario, rather than trying to use a universal rally system that tends to work in most situations, without the need to alter it often (except in the case of new structures being added to your control group.

So reddit, is my system in fact inferior, what do you use, and how would you recommend I change my rally style?




2) Viking production most commonly starts for terran players when colossus, broodlords, and other vikings need countered in TvP, TvZ, and TvT respectively. When watching pro matches, I've often seen terran players start, and continue to invest in air weapons upgrades despite their air force not necessarily being more than a small minority within their force. 

My question is, at what point in these matchups should I as a terran player start to think about investing in air weapon upgrades. Does it depend on a timing or generally how late the game is going? Should I gauge the timing of the first attack upgrade on seeing a specific number of collosus/broods/opposing viks? And what is a good method for knowing whether or not to continue with the second and third tier air weapons upgrades (avoiding the obvious answer of ""when all the units viks would counter are dead. Assume some of these units are still on the field, but the situation as changed in some other way).




3) Ravens. Pros rarely invest in them from what I can tell (with exceptions) despite their having what I see to be a plethora of excellent uses in many matchups. Examples include:

--Early-ish raven in TvZ to more efficiently slow creep spread, an ability  made all the more important after the queen buff

--Pdd against Protoss. From what I hear 2-3 ravens with a Pdd each can make a major difference against just about any army composition, considering the importance of a solid stalker count in most P builds. 

-- Raven/s + Vikings in TvT between siege lines lets you counter enemy vikings with Pdd even if you have inferior viking count, or the (lesser known and, in my opinion, underutilized) method of throwing down autoturrets next to front-running enemy sieged tanks to either absorb the initial tank shots as the rest of your army charges, or cause enemy tanks to inflict splash damage on each other

--Mobile Detection (DUH, right?) scans are awesome, but so are mules, Surely a raven with your army is more efficient than scanning whenever you need to see burrowed/cloaked units around your force

--Seeker missile. I'll include this here despite recognizing that Pdd is typically the more efficient use of 125 energy. Clumped marines get smashed by it. Using TvT as an example, players move back and forth between viewing their infrastructure and adjusting the front of their seige line, with alerts immediately drawing their attention. With a seeker missile, there is no warning (given in the form of an alert by the game) until the sucker lands, so wouldn't it be efficient to use one in that manner against clumped marines behind/around siege lines, assuming you have air control?

So, why aren't Ravens used more often? As in, almost every matchup, in almost every game. Is this something that actually IS used more often than I am led to believe, and I am merely naive? And are there other use for them I have missed? (excluding the outrageously fun but volatile mass raven strategy many a monobattle comes down to)



#4 MMM v Protoss. This may seem obvious, but humor me for a minute. While marauders are the staple of any good MMM build against Protoss at any level, sometimes I find myself wonder how many I should invest in compared to marines. Obviously, this changes depending on your build/ the opponents build, and how long the game was been going on for, but I feel like there is such a thing as too many marauders when compared to your marine count. 

Simple question: What is a good marauder:Marine Ratio in the highest efficiency MMM composition army I could get in TvP, and what other factors will force me to adjust this ratio (ex. he's going voids, get more marines)



Anyway, that's all I have for right now, I hope to see some good responses! If anything, perhaps some good discussion will come of this, as respectable debate and organized information exchange is something I don't think we see enough of on starcraft subreddits :)

Thanks ahead of time for the help, and stay classy!

TLDR #1: What rally style do you use, which do u think is best?

TLDR #2: When should I get Terran Air weapon upgrades for vikings specifically, and how do I know to continue investing in them.

TLDR #3 Why do high level players invest in ravens so little, when to me they seem like an excellent and efficient unit for a variety of reasons? 

TLDR #4 What is the ideal Marine:Marauder ratio in an MMM army against protoss, and what factors will force you to adjust this ratio as the game goes on?

Early game:

Reaper + no wall = lose SCVs to a 10 gate
Reaper + wall = lose supply depots to stalker/MSC poke
No Reaper = I have no idea what Protoss is doing unless they are bad and let my SCV back in at 5 mins. See 3 gates, prepare for blink, here comes the voidray...

What am I not doing right?

In the last week, I have scouted proxy oracle with my reaper FIVE times and killed the first oracle every time with a fast turret + marines in mineral line, but still managed to lose 4 games. (Yes, diamond Protosses are bad) but they continue to contain me by picking off building workers and small handfulls of marines. I don't know if a follow-up all-in is coming or if they double expanded, since I can't get out of my base. Even if I know what is coming next, they just fly in and attack an add-on or something not covered by my turret and I have to trade a bunch of marines for the oracles' shields to save it. Should I forgo the second barracks and tech to repaired Thors so I can all-in off my economic advantage?

Then there is random shit, I move out at ~10ish, as soon as I get mid map, I have 6 DTs in my base that just ran past the turret at the front of my natural before reinforcements could protect it, I can't base trade because I have to lift off to keep my CCs alive so I can't scan. You can't know what Protoss is doing on Whirlwind before medivacs are out, reapers can't get in heir main. Even if I scan, if I don't see a dark shrine, I just assume it is templar tech and I want to be out on the map trying to delay/deny the third base.

Then there is the FE into 4, 5, or 6 gate builds. It is impossible to get back into Protoss main on Whirlwind/Belshir/Akilon (unless the protoss is stupid) so how do I know they didn't follow up their MSC expo with a robo bay? And even if they do, how do I know it isn't going to be one of thhose 2 base 9 minute immortal busts? Sure, I can usually scout it on Star Station (But why in the world every Protoss doesn't go 1 base blink on that map is beyond comprehension since it is almost an auto-win... but I digress...)

When I take a fast third base, I get hit with Squirtle-esque 2 base colossus almost every single time, but I can never punish a fast third from Protoss like I could in WOL becasue my medivacs are later/I have fewer units due to reaper then reactor expand and Protoss having nexus cannon.

Then there is the lategame deathball, which is actually the least frustrating aprt of the matchup. I still die every time, but at least I realize that it was because I didn't start second starport soon enough, didn't stim  a marine ahead and get caught mid-map by the a-move, or started gases 4, 5 and 6 too late and therefore didn't have enough gas for ghost energy upgrade, +3 or whatever.

Everyone else seems to be less frustrated with the early and mid-game than I am, and I cannot figure out why. In WOL, I could usually make it to the point in the game where I had 3-4 nuke silos and 5+ Orbitals and TvP was my best matchup. Now it feels like I cannot do anything greedy or aggressive. I take random damage from delayed oracle, 2 base DTs, etc, Protoss always knows what  I am doing with free phoenix hallucination and stops all early aggression with photon overcharge, so I have to play ultra safe and canot ever get to those 40 suply advantages I always got in WOL. I have tried getting +2 and 8 vikings and then pulling every SCV and going for it, but it has not yet worked out for me.

So like many of you guys here, I got demoted at the beginning of this season.  So instead of working hard on nailing down builds, I've decided to mess around a bit.  I did one of my 2v2 builds just to see what would happen and have been met with wild success.  So here it is:

Let me first state that I have NOT seen any pro do this at all (and there are a variety of reasons why), but I have still had a surprising amount of success with this opener.  And believe me when I say - this is 100% definitely the easiest build I have ever done.

-----------------

**Build Order**

* 10 Depot
* 11 Refinery
* 13 Barracks
* @100% Barracks, start Factory + Reactor on Barracks
* @100% Reactor, swap off and start constant Hellion production
* WIN.

-----------------

**Execution**

I'm not even kidding - it's that simple.  I attack with 2 Hellions, then 4, then 6, and by that point in time I've won the game.  Unless they have a full walloff and position their marines defending the top of their ramp behind depots (which admittedly is not THAT rare), you can literally just win against anything they are doing.

Vs Reapers, you have to be a little defensive for a while, but it's ok because hellions scale MUCH better vs reapers than reapers scale vs hellions.

Vs Marines, you have to scout with an SCV to make sure they don't have a tight wall-off.  Obviously, you most likely are gonna have a bad time against a wall.  But for shits and giggles, I have done it anyway, and it still somewhat works.  Marine positioning AND depots are needed to hold.

Vs anything else, it doesn't matter because you're already at his base.

So what's the deal with whirlwind? Seems to me it's either really terran favored, or really terran unfavored depending entirely on where you spawn.

I'll illustrate with some drop paths: http://i.imgur.com/6pMpHJg.jpg

It seems possible to spot drops by putting a depot/marine/turret/whatever in the 3 o'clock expansion, but even then it's really tough to hold. A viking on patrol in the void between bases may also help defend.

So we're safe I guess? But then how do we apply counter-pressure? Our drop path is like 3 times as long and really awkward.

### TVT

Also in TvT, it seems really asymmetric in how vulnerable your expansion choices are, whereas the guy in the bottom-right is basically screwed if he expands to the left, the guy on the top right is pretty safe no matter which expansion he chooses.

A lot of terran players complain that protoss is super tough late game. I've noticed very few ghosts in my opponents' armies.

I understand that ghosts require micro, but even at my level as protoss in order to even survive against terran I have to make sentries and high templar to deal with massive bio attacks. This requires a bit of micro to land the spells effectively. Similarly I would expect a bit of snipe/EMP micro would be considered standard issue in TvP.

What's up? Are they too expensive? Tricky to use? Don't like their attitude?

With the new maps Akilon Flats and Newkirk District, push distances even on these 2 player maps are getting outrageously far and completely makes tempo based aggression non-viable. I'm talking about being able to hit a strong timing and continuously reinforce / take good engagements forcing my opponent to spend resources on his army and challenging his ability to macro well while having to manage his army. These pushes are already delayed a significant amount by the rush distance and forcefields and it also gives the opponent a lot more time to react accordingly (Zerg).

Even having near perfect unit production and timing of production facilities, I just feel like I'm being tunneled into standard macro games. How exactly are we to utilize our supposed ""advantage in the early to mid game"" when the maps don't allow that? God forbid our whole army is in the middle of the map now when a full warp-in or warp prism comes into our bases.

I saw a lot of you guy had problems with TvP. I haven't played for 4 months and 4 days ago I started playing again. I had huge problems with TvP. Late game TvP is disgusting when you have some lags and are just not fast enough to do everything you have to do. I got frustrated and then made my own built. I'll post replays but I'll explain for you guys and what i think when I do things. 
1. First of all you go 1 rax expo

2. You get 1 marine than supplydepot and after that double gas. 

3. The SCV that was building the depo builds the first bunker 

4. With the first 100 gas get a factory. 

5. After that get cloacked banchees. 

(6. You need to scout after the bunker or before that when they go for an all in you have to built at least 3 bunkers and have SCV's prepaired to repair)  

7. After the first banchee and when you can afford it built another factory and an amory. 

8. Start Thor production and harras. (Make sure NOT to lose a banchee, they are a huge DPS dealer in the fight.) 

9. Add 2 more rax

10. With about 4 thors you move out. Make sure to take at least 10 SCV's

11. Focus important units with your banchee's

Just started playing team games after laddering up to gold/pt league. The maps dont seem to be designed in a way that 1v1 builds translate over. 

Right now I've been playing bronze league team games, I dont think Ive lost any in memory. They seem extremely easy, but I know I will be playing decent matches evenutally. 

Only half the maps seem to be viable for a 1 rax FE. The others... Ive been doing a 6 rax. In addition to the role Terran plays, is a 6 rax cheese? Is cheese BM? I really dont know what to do/practice on these maps. I am doing quite well on a 6rax to the point where my teammate doesnt have to do anything. I can easily take out any expos with it, and I can expand while attacking. I guess, I want to know, how should I be playing team games? Is a 6 rax only good against easy opponents? 

I know team games arent ultra competitive like 1v1, but that doesnt mean I dont want to play well.

How do I get started?,Skurpe,18,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1247ik/thinking_of_switching_from_protoss_to_terran_how/,"Hello there. I'm a friendly master league Protoss who has grown tired of turtling or all-inning in every single matchup, and has challenged a diamond Terran friend of mine in a race to master league (both as T). Hopefully I'll enjoy it, and if so, I'll switch over completely.

Now, I've not followed any Terran match-up except for TvP for a long time, so I have no clue what to do in TvT, nor in TvZ and I'm lost buildorderwise aswell, even in TvP.

I've compiled a little list on what I want help with, and if you have other good general advice, I'm more than happy to hear them.

- Build orders. Where can I find some good standard ones?
- Army compositions lategame. (Marine/Marauder ratio in TvP, tank count TvZ etc).
- Scouting. How do I scout my opponent after my initial SCV scout, and how often would you suggest I do it?
- Control groups. This seems like the trickiest to me. As Protoss, I bind all my army on a hotkey, then have my stalkers in one group, and my templars in one, meaning I can efficently blink forward, aswell as backing up my templars, but still move my whole army with a single click. As Terran, vikings have to be in a seperate group alltogether. Would you suggest I do the same with ghosts, or could I have them in my bio army aswell? Also, how do you control medivacs? I can't have them in the same group, since they don't heal if I stutter step. 
- How do I know when to take additional bases? When do I go planetary and when can I go for the orbital?
- Streamers. Which ones give good commentary about what they're doing? I'm looking for Terran who stream similarly to how Axslav does it. Lot's of commentary.
- Other things I should focus on?

I would like to add also that I'm pretty decent mechanically, and keeping my money low isn't a big issue. Army control and general decision making is mostly the problem I would guess. At this point, I'm probably at a level of high platinum or low diamond.

I hope the long post hasn't scared you away, and any advice is greatly appriciated!

______________________________________________  
Intro:
Today I am happy to announce the start of a new show!  
I'm sure many of you have had games where you have had no idea what happened!  
WTF! Broodlords! HOW? HOW DID I LOSE THAT GAME!  
Well today I am here to help you. ATT and TL offers a great service where people can upload replays and many people put in a lot of effort in responses. However, videos allow specificity and detail that can't be done in paragraph form.
_____________________________________________  
Format:
Smart Saturdays is a live streamed show. I will analyze every game submitted live on stream on my [stream.](http://twitch.tv/madsc2)  After each show, I will upload each individual game to [www.youtube.com/madstarcraft](http://youtube.com/madstarcraft).  
I will analyze all replays. Additionally, guests will be brought on to add more commentary and analysis.  
_____________________________________________  
How to Submit?  
If you would like your games to be analyzed please send them either through an attachment or a link to drop.sc to madstarcraft@gmail.com.  
Please tag your email under the two categories. ""A"" and ""F"". ""A"" = Analyze ""F"" = Fun.  
For example: Subject: A TvT Madsc2 vs IM.MVP  
A game tagged as F will be uploaded directly to youtube and casted for fun.  
_____________________________________________  
Who is Madsc2?  
I'm a 17 year old masters terran player currently playing for Righteous Dawn Gaming. I'm in my senior year of HS and trying as hard as I can to start a career in eSports. I stream very regularly at www.twitch.tv/madsc2. My priority is to help players improve and reach their goals. I can remember the struggles of bronze league and the cheesiness of diamond.
______________________________________________  
Conclusion:  
I would strongly encourage anyone struggling to improve to submit your games. It can't hurt! Let me help you improve and enjoy this wonderful game of ours.

1. It's obvious that the Warhound needs to be nerfed from 2 to 3 supply. Right now it absolutely destroys everything except spell casters on a per-supply basis (if not per-cost basis).

2. Reapers are not going to make a comeback except for TvT cheese. The +10 HP, -5 sec build time, and +0.5 range are nice. But the only unit matchup that it affects are Reapers vs Marines. The new HP regen is not worth losing the speed upgrade and the building attack. They are still decent vs Hydras and Lings, but that's pretty much it.

3. Tanks are no longer going to be a massable unit. Something like 80% of the new HOTS units are going to hard-counter them. Hellions and Warhounds will be able to waltz into siege lines and trade cost-efficiently. Vipers and Swarm Hosts will pluck siege lines apart, and do so much more quickly than Broodlords do now. And most of the new Protoss stuff is in the air, which tanks can't touch.

4. Mech is going to be viable in TvP again. Hellion/Mine/Warhound/Ghost/Viking will be able to take on any Protoss unit combination just like MMMGV does now. The sad thing is that mech TvP is not going to feel much different from playing bio TvP because its going to be Tankless. 

5. Lategame TvZ is going to be impossible. The Ultra buff is huge, it lets Ultras trade cost efficiently with bio, and it will allow Ultras to dominate mech too. Swarm Hosts are better Broodlords in every way: they require less investment, are far more mobile, and are just as good at breaking positions. Hydras becoming much more viable will make drops much more difficult to pull off. All four of those units will hard-counter Tanks, so goodbye tanks in TvZ. I see TvZ devolving into a very cheesy matchup where either the Terran all-ins before Hive or simply loses.

6. I was not impressed with battle hellions. The only thing they are better than normal hellions against are Tanks and Roaches (and they're still pretty bad against Roaches). They are not much better versus Zealots than normal hellions (assuming that the normal hellions are microed). Battle hellions would work very well paired with Tank lines in most situations...but because Tanks going out the door, so too will battle hellions.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,1342888667.0,,icon-rank-diamond,True,t3_wxeru,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/wxeru/now_that_the_heart_of_the_swarm_custom_map_is/,

I'm not saying terran is week, or some other race is OP, rather terran's late game is similar if not the same to the early game and It doesn't seem to change in HoTs. 

What do I mean? Protoss, same as Zerg, have this goal, this progression, back-door if u will. Both races, at early-mid stage play as terran do and simply producing units and teching. Some faster then others but the principle stays the same. However, past tier 2, somewhat after 15 minutes, terran pretty much looses ability of improving and becomes ""reactionary"" race. All would be good, but good read will not give advantage as with other races. Rather will allow to brake even. Vikings become useless after killing colossis or broodlords, same as marauders do nothing if ultras are dead. Probably the most ""disgusting"" thing is when protoss mixes HT with Colossis, or zerg broods with infestors and ultras.. It makes it nearly impossible to win straight off engagement. There are ways 2 win of course, but those games are won by playing on opponents weaknesses i.e. doom drop, rather in straight of engagement. 

I strongly believe, that Terran requires some tier 3 unit, that will require other races to react and not just blindly build what they want. Easiest would probably be to patch BC's speed and damage output. Instead of high speed -low power cannons, give them slow speed-high power, relatively like it was in brood war and add a little bit of speed and get rid of energy (HT's demolish them). Also would be nice to make 250mm cannons on Thors at least somewhat useful.

1340908269.0,11,self.AllThingsTerran,vr4m1,Our Friend The Raven,slayersmander,14,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/vr4m1/our_friend_the_raven/,"So lately I have been reading a lot online and people have been saying that all other races have gone through discovering new things as the game changes. Personally, I think most of the new builds Zerg and Protoss discover are in response to the new builds Terran has to discover in light of nerfs, but that opinion aside, I have been busting my ass to make the Raven look good. So far, no such luck.

**My First Attempt, A Mediocre Timing**

TvZ: So I was experimenting with a fast expand walloff with a bit of deception. I thought I was so clever. The Zerg scouts, sees a walloff at my natural with 2 rax and an engineering bay. The Engineering bay is researching. Clearly my composition will have BIO in it.

In truth, I get 4 gas as soon as I get my second base up and running, actually taking a bit of a hit to my econ. I rush 2 port /w tech labs, even if it IS scouted I am golden because he will counter Banshees. What I actually do is, build 2 ravens, and within the first 10 seconds of those ravens, get Corvid Reactor, and as soon as those 2 ravens are done I produce 2 more. Ravens take 60 seconds to produce, thus when corvid is done, 2 more ravens pop out, only 10 energy lower than the first 2 (which are at almost 100 energy). Now at this point I will point out that my engineering bay is not getting +1 armour or weapons, it is researching building armour. I go to either the Zergs first or third, and drop as many auto-turrets as possible, usually in an inconvenient corner, and if at all possible, I leave a gap in the middle to drop mules into. Now I have a bunch of turrets with 3 armour fighting unupgraded Zerglings, at 9 minutes. Rarely have I delt with banelings at this point. Sadly, resources lost usually LOOKS about even, but that is only because Auto Turrets have a resource value. (Part of the SC2 engine requires anything that can be repaired have a resource value otherwise it is free) but typically I do more damage than I take. If he is well defended against air, just drop a PDD and 2 less auto-turrets. If he has a lot of spores, he will usually be behind on lings.

After this I preserve the 4 ravens all game. You can go around dropping turrets and killing tumors to prevent creep spread, an emergency PDD at a base harassed by mutas, and whatever else I think of doing with them. I also get Seeker Missle early on, and as long as I keep those ravens alive, I have it as an option.

Once the harass starts, I lift both starports, build a new tech lab and a new reactor. Then I replace the two tech labs with factories. The natural transition is of course mech, and sometimes with a few banshees for good measure.

Sounds interesting? It's not. The Ravens arrive at 9 minutes, which puts you on the razors edge if he went mutas, and if you are not positive he did not, you will often lose them all. A bane bust has never successfully countered this build, but I am fairly sure it easily could. (Either the turrets or my expansion)

So, if we look at this experiment, I call it a failure. I have ravens early so they have a lot of energy, I have research that makes them stronger and gives them their third ability, I am meching which is strong against Zerg right now. I even expand confidently. But I still feel I gain no edge in the lategame, and rarely do enough damage to justify putting off regular mech.

Anyone have any other experiences with this terrible unit? Any ideas?",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,icon-rank-diamond,True,t3_vr4m1,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/vr4m1/our_friend_the_raven/,

I'm a mid-silver league Terran looking for some benchmarks for the 1/1/1 build. I've seen about half of the filtersc videos, but would like some variety in what I build to handle other things. What I am specifically looking for are benchmarks like filtersc's to put a gauge on how I am performing when I choose this build (At 10min I should have ___). 

Some things I've noticed and would like to ask about,

1.) It seems that when I leave one rax and tech to starport my main army size is *tiny.* I'm putting down my natural and extra rax or two around 8 minutes or so (about when I can afford it), but I still feel really vulnerable even though I have a tank or two and a medivac or two around 10min. I am not missing SCV's or marines. I am also getting stim/combat shield (depending on matchup) and +1atk to time out to completion ~10min. Armory starts when I have the resources.

2.) When should I tech and start pumping out marauders? 

3.) When should I put down my natural? I've been doing it around 8 minutes as that's about when I can afford it. I need the extra gas to maintain tank/medivac production.

Overall, I've seen great versatility from this build, but if I get attacked heavily around the ten minute mark it seems like things fall apart. It allows me to harass with early drops. It just seems to be weak around 8-10 minutes until I get the extra production up.",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,,True,t3_u8srd,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/u8srd/looking_for_benchmarks_for_111_opening/,

I am not the best player in the world, but I think that I can help many of you with  troubling ladder experiences against Protoss.

Here are a few screen shots to show you my level and abilities.

My ladder: http://i.imgur.com/pvKgHLb.jpg

Pts of the last Protoss I played: http://i.imgur.com/bCsuWjq.jpg

I chose to show these pictures so that you can all have a solid idea of my skill level and ability.  I am not the greatest player in the world nor am I the worst.  I am not extremely active as you can see from my low numbers of games and my high bonus pool.  I also try to enjoy SC2 more by doing fun and unique strategies and trying to learn.  I am not trying very hard to get my points or mmr very high.  With all of this in mind, I will move onto the actual content of this post: A solid and very fun Terran vs. Protoss all in.

Or if you so chose opener to be followed by macro.

I was taught this strategy by a German Terran player who's name shall not be disclosed.  It is an economical proxy factory widow mine opener into a two base bio all in.  

The build order is as follows:
10 Depot
12 Rax
13 Gas
@100% Rax send SCV that build Rax to proxy Factory on the other side of the map. 
15 Orbital
16 Supply Depot
after you start the factory build a bunker next to your wall off.
You should now be streaming widow mines into your opponents base.  

Notes on WM:  Your goal is to get a widow mine near the main mineral line of your opponent.  This is optimal but not necessary to win.  A single stalker does not have enough DPS to stop a widow mine from getting into the main and burrowing.  Neither does a zealot if you dodge it a bit.  A mothership core has more than enough dps to stop a widow mine, and if you are attacked by one, burrow immediately.  If your widow mine gets surrounded by probes burrow it immediately the probes won't stop it from burrowing.  You will get better in time learning how to move burrow and unburrow your widow mines.  

I usually send three widow mines into at the Protoss base and then make 3 more and send them to my own base.

While making the widow mines and constant marines you will save up enough minerals to get a command center.  Build it on the high ground.  

The follow up I do to this opener is:  I get 2 additional barracks, a reactor, and a tech lab on them once they finish leaving the original barracks naked for some time.  I then get an ebay (start plus 1 attack) and a turret in my natural as well as a bunker. (salvage the one in your main).  I get a starport and build one medivac and push  along with stim and some marine marauder.  While I am doing this push I go up to 5 barracks with 2 reactors and 3 tech labs.  I follow up with an SCV pull all in at 13-14 minutes.  If they go colossi push with 4 vikings if they are going Templar tech try to push a little earlier 12-13 minutes.

Some of you may call this gimmicky or whatever but I assure you that is not the case.  This is much less risky than a Protoss proxying a tech for a few reasons.  It is less of an investment to make widow mines than protoss units.  They will always serve at least a small purpose of scouting and containing.  You can lift off your factory and use the tech to get your starport.  On top of all of this you do not have to follow up this build with a two base all in.  You can always do your own variation and macro out of it.  I chose to all in with this build because I don't like playing macro vs toss without very fast upgrades.

Due to mech's low mobility, I'm unsure as to how to attack without either leaving my bases terribly vulnerable to counters or having to leave behind enough force to cover my bases and making any attacking force relatively weak.  I'm pretty comfortable playing marine tank and using the mobility of stimmed marines and medivacs to exploit the positioning of other players but I don't understand how to 
play with mech.

How do you guys overcome the inability of mech to cover a lot of ground to exploit openings in the other player's defense without leaving your own bases open to a quick counter-attack?

Insight into my problem against both bio and other mech players in the match-up are welcome.  Thanks everyone. 

EDIT: Thanks for your responses everyone, I'm going to pay more attention to turret placement and general map awareness, as well as holding some hellions or banshees for counter support.

Assuming a 12 barracks here, you have about a 10 second window before your barracks finishes when your CC can either start another SCV which delays the orbital slightly or cut SCVs to get an orbital immediately when the barracks finishes.

For most of my Starcraft career I've been in Silver league and have been playing on and off, not really devoting time to learning and progressing as a player. I've switched races a lot and have ended up playing Terran for now, so I don't have a lot of experience with it.

I got Heart of the Swarm a couple days ago and quickly knocked out my placement matches and was really surprised to see that I placed in Gold after not playing for quite a while and never really getting past 8th ranked Silver. So, now I'm at 100 Gold and I don't know where to go from here.

I have a lot of trouble with expanding past 2 bases and even then, my natural expansion comes way later than it should, or I don't use it correctly. Also, I don't really know how to tech properly with Terran. I would like to play with marines, tanks, medivacs, and widow mines, but I can never get there quickly and efficiently like I would like to. Thirdly,  one of my big problems is attacking at the right time or moving out to get a foothold that will give me map control. A lot of the time I just find myself trapped at two bases and hoping that my enemy just crashes their army into mine and loses so I win, which I think is caused also by my lack of vision on the map.

Here are some of my recent replays, if you're interested:
[Game 1](http://ggtracker.com/matches/2789616)
[Game 2](http://ggtracker.com/matches/2789613)
[Game 3](http://ggtracker.com/matches/2789626)

I watch DeMusliM a lot and he's basically the reason I decided to try out Terran. I love the way he plays and I love his style. Basically, I want to get to the point where I am confident enough in my play to emulate his style and mix it up with my own.

I really need a good all around build that I can work with to hone my mechanics and get me used to Terran and the units.

As the title says, I made a short-ish guide with a few tips and tricks that you can use for extending the purpose of both buildings and units in the earlier stages of games. Some of them are more widely used than others, and hopefully it can provide you with some small advantages or at least things to try out to improve your game. I write quite a few Terran guides, so any feedback on how I can improve or what I do that's good would be really helpful :)

I really don't think anything is the patch helped the problems with mech.  Sure a siege tank shot will ward off a early push, but then toss knows you're meching, builds immortals and then you loose your mech army.  

Free siege has changed my TvT and TvZ.  TvT you have to get tank/viking out quick or else your dead.  TvZ, an early tank will save your ass from a lot of early roach/ling/bling pushes which is nice.

It's kinda nice to be able to make a reaper whenever to scout, but I felt like I could do that before.  The best is when another T goes mass reaper, and the reapers all just die.

Hellbats are now pretty good vs zealots, but toss still feels OP as shit.  I don't really know what to do.  Sometimes I get lucky with a thor/hellbat push, but that fucking nexus cannon makes it really hard to assault a toss from the front.

&gt; 7.PDD blocks Tempest shots, but does not blocks Widow Mine shots, Fungal Growth projectile and Seeker Missle

&gt; 13.Widow Mine splash can damage your and enemy buildings. Probably thats the reason, why splash damage is not bigger, than 50 (now it is 40), or it will be able to kill enemy zerg tumors

&gt; 14.Widow Mine attack ignores armor and Hardened Shields (it can 3 shot Immortal), does not detects to cloaked/burrowed units and reacts to time-based units, like Locusts, Broodlings and Infested terrans. It also will kill Changeling if not morphed to Marine skin

&gt; 22.Don't forget about new dances for Oracle, Roach, MULE and Stalker!

&gt; 30.Four banelings can do a lot of damage to group of Hellbats. Just use minimum 4 banelings against hellbats, if you want to fight against them effectively.

&gt; 38.Widow Mine will not trigger to Larvas, but they can kill eggs.

&gt; 44.Siege Tanks against Swarm Hosts (both in big numbers) always results with zero damage to Siege Tanks. But Blinding Cloud can change that scenario completely

&gt; 45.Mutalisks can quickly reach at 4 speed enemy Medivacs (their speed is 2.5). But for 8 seconds Medivacs can fly at 4.25 speed

&gt; 46.For now units will always auto-leave Blinding Cloud (excluding deployed Siege Tanks). Try to block enemy movement with fungals or mass-zerglings to make Blinding Cloud more effective

&gt; 51.Because of better splash, Hellbats with Blue Flame upgrade can clear Larvaes quicker, than Helions

&gt; 53.PDD does not blocks Thor's High Impact Payload, because it's not a projectile or missel attack

&gt; 54.Blinding Cloud affects Planetary Fortress, all static defences (Spin/Spore Crawlers, Missile Turrets, Photons) and Overcharged Nexus. But not affects bunker

&gt; 56.Cloak when the widow mine missle is launched let's unit to take only splash damage (40)

&gt; 60.Only 6 Marines can kill Oracle. 5 Mainres will die to one oracle. But the more marines you have, the less effective Oracle become. 10 marines can kill 2 Oracles. But two widow Mines can make this scenario better for Terran.

&gt; 61.Try to drop Widow Mines, especially with faster burrow. It can be a new Terran aanswer to Protoss Storm Drop

&gt; 63.Force Filed does not blocks Widow Mine attack. It can fire missile when it's placed under Force Field

&gt; 64.Try to experiment with Widow Mine and Siege Tank placing.

&gt; 1. If Widow Mine range is not near Siege Tank, probably it will not trigger on Zerglings, so they will destroy Siege Tank

&gt; 2. If Widow Mine range is closer to Siege Tank (it placed at 5-6 range from Siege Tank), it will trigger on zerglings, but with some splash damage on tanks

&gt; 3. One zergling can't drain Widow Mine charge, if Widow Mine is placed inside Siege Tank radius. Even if Widow Mine placed at maxium radius from Siege Tank. 

&gt; 4. Widow Mine have small delay before attack. As I said, try to experiment with WM and ST weapon ranges to reach better effect at defending specific location

&gt; 67.You can abduct enemy SCV that building something. Of course building process will be stoped

&gt; 71.Abducting Ghost cancels Nuclear Missile spotting

&gt; 72.Splitting or spreading Swarm Hosts and adding creep spread from Overlords or Creep Tumors will significally buff Locusts against Siege Tanks. Locusts can reach enemy tanks quicker and when splitted, they're getting less splash damage.

1356227946.0,13,self.AllThingsTerran,15b2fi,"How I've felt about SC2 for the past few months, and questions on how you have as well",Rockztar,23,10,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/15b2fi/how_ive_felt_about_sc2_for_the_past_few_months/,"So, basically, I'm making this thread after watching Homestory Cup. It has basically been the last ""chance"" I wanted to give WoL.

About a year ago I lived and breathed for SC2. I'll admit Terran was strong, but I felt like SC2 gameplay was still peaking at this point. I hate admitting it to myself now, but I am terribly bored and frustrated with the game. My inspiration for playing the game came from watching pro games, but the game is so obviously broken. I've just completely lost all faith in Blizzard's ability to make lategame work for Terran.

The game used to be so exciting to watch, especially TvZ. All my favorite games are TvZ, especially the Mvp vs Nestea and MMA vs DRG on Shakura's Plateau are on the top of my list.

What bothers me so much is not only how easy Blizzard has made Zerg and Protoss to play strategically, but how their way of fixing imbalance has been to take units to the extremes. Ghost has been rendered completely useless in TvT and TvZ for the most part. We used to see some funny, entertaining ghost openings in TvT for example. Or remember MMA vs Mvp on Metalopolis for example? Such exciting nuke play.

And let's be realistic. Zergs and Protoss is super easy to play, when it comes to strategy compared to Terran. All you have to do is defend, build up a good army and attack, not to mention it requires a lot less APM to control their armies.

Obviously Zerg is the biggest problem. Not only has Terran lategame been nerfed, but Zerg has been buffed in so many ways at the same time. Newer maps are super hard to drop on compared to ones such as Shakura's Plateau. It used to take a lot of effort to handle drops, not you can ward off the worst with a few spores and spines, because there's no space behind mains on newer maps. It also means the only unit we ever see Zergs use lair for is Infestor, because mutalisks have become a joke compared to their former days of glory with high multitasking from both Zerg and Terran fighting with marines, thors and turrets against giant clouds of 30+ mutalisks.

Most of the action that the game sees now, is Terran building some hellion/banshee openers(which also have become less actionpacked with the queen buff). Then it's just both parts sitting back, and casters talking about ""omg, Z is making infestors!"". We wait till lategame, where Zerg obviously wins. 

Should the Terran get ahead early on, the game often still ends going to Zerg with casters saying ""Oh yeah, the T forgot how strong infestors are, he should've attacked before the Zerg made infestors"".

It is just such a joke. We used to be such a mighty race. I really think Zerg needed some buffs, but this is too much, and the most frustrating part is how the community has acted like it wasn't that big of a deal, also Blizzard up until recently. It's great that Blizzard promoted a unit, but they really turned it into Infestorcraft. I'm sick and tired of always tuning into streams, and 95% of the time it's PvZ, because Terrans have been evaporated from the scene. And Terran isn't even entertaining to watch anymore. Sure it's fun watching lategame Metropolis games, where T can turtle back and hope the Zerg is stupid enough to not just take all the bases, and sit back with all the money, and instead run his army into the Terran till he's dry.

It's no fucking wonder LoL is becoming so popular. Blizzard has been so eager to test small fucking nonsense details thoroughly such as goddamn overlord speed. Give them the fucking speed I don't give a shit. Double it, if you want. Add some goddamn pace to the game, and instead focus on actually making Ghosts, Ravens, Battlecruisers, Carriers, Mutalisks, Vikings whatever more usable. Their way of balancing the game has been unentertaining, and I don't feel like playing it anymore, because all that's viable for me these days is to make the same t1 and 2 units over and over, and see them getting fungaled to death time and time again.

I'm not gonna bother with this game until WoL is out, freaking amazing how many balance updates they can make there to change the game, but haven't been able to change more than a few things to fuck everything up entirely in WoL.

I know this is a whiny rant, but I need to talk about it with my brother Terrans.

I guess my biggest thought when it comes to the BC is why hasn't it been changed/buffed yet? 

When you read about TvZ/TvP the common complaints are about MMM being too strong and Terran being able to stay on T1/2 units the whole game, the problem with that is that these units need to be strong because it's the bread and butter of our early, mid and late game army. As a TvP/Z goes on it becomes harder and harder for the Terran to win with this composition, obviously in certain situations you add Ghosts/Vikings/Thors/Tanks to your army but we don't really have anything to tech into like Protoss and Zerg do. When you're the Terran it's completely up to you to be the aggressor and if you fail to do the necessary damage before Collosus/Templar or Infestors/Ultralisks/Brood are out you're left completely behind and fighting the rest of the game from the back foot. 

Nowadays Zerg have extra queens to defend early game pressure, by the time you can hope to do any real damage they'll be easily ready with baneling/zergling/infestor. I've experienced this first hand off-racing as Zerg.

Protoss have also become adept at defending the classic 9-10minute timing push, if this push fails you're left completely open to a game-ending counter attack.

For Protoss and Zerg while they're fighting and trading armies they are also teching to their late-game units (Archons, Collosus, Broodlords). So what if the Terran t3 late-game unit was good? Something to tech to when you have a macro advantage, often the only time we see Battlecruisers are in late game TvT were it's a Tank vs Tank seige war, and even then it's very rare. A player I can think of that does this is Demuslim. 


So what do you guys think? Should the Battlecruiser been changed? If so what would you do to change it? I know it's getting a small speed increasing ability in HotS but I don't think that fixes any of the issues.           
                                                  
What if the Yamato Cannon had a splash?

His build vs zerg was very cool and given the way that zergs are playing these days (building no lings and just queens), I have tried this build out again and it has been very sucessful. Basically, you go 111 off one base, then expand after you tech to cloak banshees, similar to a TvT opening. This build is like a one -two punch. First Hellions and Marines, which almost always kills queens and some drones, and then cloak banshee to do even more damage and buy time until your mech two base is established. 

The build is as follows:

10 depot (not at wall)

12 Rax (edge of wall)

13 refinery

depot when needed

@100 gas Factory at other edge of wall, leaving gap in middle

Next refinery

Starport, tech to cloak banshees
Push at two hellions and the marines you have with constant production out of the fact and rax

rally units down to the zerg if things are going well. Worst case scenario you kill some lings and he has a spine, so you just continue with cloak banshee harass. 

Follow up with mech play.

So this is awesome.  This gives me a way to push my ceiling higher.  Now every time I play a game, that will be my mini-game I shall play within the game - make 50 damn workers by 10 minutes.

I also put two builds in there that are easy to pick up for new players (like me) and ones I've found success with, also.

Now, it might not be as helpful to a veteran player who's already crushing people on ladder but I thought it would help people like myself taking baby steps in ranked.

1372119121.0,11,self.AllThingsTerran,1h063s,Hellion/marauder early game. (Discussion for all 3 matchups),Ethic13,13,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1h063s/hellionmarauder_early_game_discussion_for_all_3/,"Hey ATT,

Recently I have been giving hellion/marauder compositions a try in the early game. I have been met with mixed success, but that's probably got more to do with some mechanical problems on my part. Regardless, the point of this post is just to throw out some opinions on the style, and see what other players think. The style feels very fluid and safe, and I haven't lost in such a way where I wished I'd had a different mix. 

I expect one of the first retorts to come up would be: ""why not just use hellbats?"" To which I answer: Mobility, map control, and leanness.

Hellions are great for simply getting out on the map, while still threatening a player who is inattentive. In addition, they don't have to be tethered to a medivac to do so.

Build wise, you just outright don't need an armory, and depending on what you want to do, can build something other than medivacs or delay the starport altogether. 

Don't get me wrong, hellbats are awesome, but in the early game I've been preferring hellions (there's still plenty of room to transition into hellbats deeper in the mid game). 

The style functions fairly differently depending on matchup, but opens more or less the same. I've just been using a regular old reaper FE &gt; reactor &gt; factory &gt; swap and build TL on the rax. Nothing complex.

TvT: 

This is the matchup where I feel the most safe with this style. The reaper scout is always nice, and you have quick hellions to stop all the really early threats (reapers, marines, drops). And further on you have enough of them to thwart hellbats, plus marauders to defend against thors. I don't neglect marines though, but if I do, I make sure to have a Viking or two.

I also tend to extend my hellion usage the longest in this matchup, making them until both stim and combat shield complete on the one techlab. I set up the marine and medivac infrastructure at the same time. Afterwards is a very clean transition into marine/tank by just swapping addons again.

TvZ: 

There's not a whole lot to say here. It plays out like how Polt used to use it. If Zerg is greedy you can punish them, if they all-in, you have a sold defensive mix.

TvP: 

Easily the weirdest matchup. Before making hellions, I get 2 mines, no exceptions. One in each mineral field to defend against oracles. 

The first hellions I make immediately scour the map (while that reaper pokes into their base as much as possible) to eliminate the treat of proxies.

I play this matchup extremely aggressive and unsubtle. Usually I just get 2 extra rax (reactored) and +1 bio attack, stim and combat shields for a 9-10 minute timing. This is by far my most effective play in any matchup. It is pretty all-in-ish, but most toss players are getting greedy, and honestly, I don't think the nexus cannon is nearly as good as people think (but I'm not arguing that point).

Otherwise I just do some hellion drops, and do the basic transition into hellbat/marauder like usual.

As always, the key to this matchup is scouting, and just generally being on point with macro.

So what do you guys think? I definitely enjoy this style because it feels very meta independent, you win or lose on the merits of your skill alone. Plus, having an opener that works in all 3 matchups feels really solid. 

If there are any blind counters to this style, I have yet to face them. I know it lacks anti air, but I haven't seen anything that isn't deflected by a regularly timed missile turret or mines.

It's mostly protoss anyway, but overall I have pretty decent macro, it could use some work lategame, for sure, but I really have a problem with just throwing away 200/200 armies in seconds and not knowing what just occurred. 

I guess what I really want to know is the most efficient head-desk way to learn how to micro huge viking-marine-maurauder-medivac-ghost armies, it's annoying to outmacro a protoss and have to watch you lose your whole army due to derphands.

I read the other recent post on sniping with ghosts via minimap, and I intend on doing that, since one of the ways I used to inject was via minimap, it's something I'm accustomed to.

Thanks guys.

Also, any general micro tips as terran you don't have to do as other races would be great. I'm thinking I just have a friend of mine go into unit tester with me and just go ham on that for a while, but I'm wondering if there's an even better way.

Just before we get into the question I'll give some background about myself and my play. 

Currently I'm high diamond on NA and low masters on EU, trying to work up to mid-high masters. How I've gotten so far with such poor ghost control is early pressure or multi drop pressure (some games I can snipe important buildings or even their nexus but still end up losing). So there hasn't been must chance for me to get to late game. But now that I'm starting to get played against better protoss players that get hts early or go for hts instead of colossi I usually have too poor ghost control to snipe or emp them.

Something that I've tried is going for hellbats instead of ghosts to tank which works if they go really zealot based without high colossi count but doesn't seem like something that I can rely on.

What I'm looking for are some suggestions on what I could do other than practice late game against protoss but I don't seem to find many when laddering.

Thanks for looking!

So there has been a slight change in the ways that the coaches are determined, If you wish to coach, please edit the tile on the spreadsheet that corresponds with the player that you wish to coach.

We will start coaching after the tournament this weekend, which doesn't have anyone to cast/organize as I will be doing Ludum Dare and be out of town (for the jam) but if you want to do it message me... So it will be a replay tourney unfortunately...

After the tourney we want coaches to pick and message their players so they can start on coaching immediately.

The tournament bracket will be released on Friday and will take place on Saturday, I will try to moderate as best as possible.

So, the other day ATT mod Blazingkin got me some delicious Reddit Gold, and I thought I should try to give something back.  Having seen an awful lot of threads about struggling with mech in the sub recently, I decided some people might be able to make use out of a small meching replay pack.

Contained within are 12 mech replays, 4 vs each race, all played within the last week at a decent Masters level.  I tried to choose interesting games that used different builds to give the most aid to anyone combing them for something useful.  There are some short 2 base timing attacks, there are some mined-out-map hour long slugfests, there are some in-betweens.

**Reasons you might want to download this replay pack:**

* You want to learn a mech build.
* You want to pick up some tips and tricks you can use while meching against different compositions.
* You want to see how you can do a transition into SkyTerran without dying.
* You want to see what happens in a SkyTerran vs SkyTerran TvT after the map runs out of gas.
* You have ridiculously low APM and wonder if it's possible to get to Masters without increasing it.
* You grow strong on Zerg and Protoss tears.
* You miss Trump.
* You're a masochist.
* You're a [Soviet Gaming](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/Soviet_Gaming) groupie.
* You're my mom.

I know what I am *supposed* to be doing but the precise mechanics of it just seem impossible to pull off. My problem is targeting the right units. I am trying to target down a couple of tiny units in a mass of units hiding somewhere behind a bunch of health bars, explosions, Storm effects and Thermal Lance sweeping back and forth.

The traditional approach with ghosts: got me Ghosts all hot-keyed up... cloak... move forward... scan for Observers... finger on the trigger ready to snipe... bollocks all my Ghosts are dead. I find it impossible to target a tiny unit in the middle of a mass of Toss units in the split second before I'm dead.

I've tried keeping my Ghosts inside the bio-ball but then I find that by the time I've figured out where his Templars are multiple storms have already hit and I'm never even sure if my EMPs have landed. Is it just me or is the EMP animation/sound effect really subtle? Either way I get stomped.

So I have pretty much given up on Ghosts and have more success going sky. I usually get half a dozen Banshees and a few Vikings, scan his army and a-move the Vikings to snipe the observers, then cloaked Banshees pick off his Templars and soften up the rest of his army before bio moves in. This works great unless he has Colossi. Then I have to target the Observers otherwise the Vikings will target the Colossi. By the time I've picked out the Observers my Vikings are dead to Stalkers/Storm.

**TL;DR: I find it impossible to pick out and target the important units in the visual clutter of the Protoss deathball in the few seconds I have before Storm/Colossus wipes out my army. Any suggestions?**

I have been trying different variations of the 10 minute push, to put pressure on the toss. However, it seems like every toss was prepared for it, and only way I could win this is if I microed my heart out, took a third, and prepared for the colossus.

40% of the time, I would end up winning, typically because the protoss was just bad. They didn't micro (what little they need late game) or allowed me to harass them to death. The other 60% of the time, I would get pushed in a late game battle where AOE wins all. Which I would argue it is harder to be the Terran in this.

There is something that I have been noticing in the replays that I reviewed. All of the protoss are skipping their early game defense, they realize that my push is going to come at 10 minutes, and if they get splash they will win! This realization made me think about the strategy that I would do before. The 4 Rax Pressure.

The 4 rax pressure use to be the thing to do on ladder. Of course this can be your downfall if you aren't macroing and/or lose all of your marines to good sentry control. However, this is pressure right now is meta-game gold. I thought I would share about the success that I have been having. Currently I have about 90% win with this strat.

*NOTE: This requires that you scout, and they are going 1 gate FE. This strategy is also good at holding many allins, struggles against 1 base blink stalker, which you will need to scout, and react by grabbing gas, and switching production to marauders.

TLDR: Protoss is skipping early game defense, which can be punished economically.

The HotS beta deserves some space here too.

Right now, there is nowhere to discuss Terran in HotS. I want to know what you fellow Terrans do in each matchup. I also want to discuss the current metagame in the Beta. I thought this thread could come in handy too, because I can answer any questions about the beta, and I am sure other people will pitch in with this.

**Let's get on to the juicy bits!**

Here are my current builds and tactics:

* **TvZ** - I go for marine/medivac/widow mine from a pretty early reactor expand. I push out with stim and CS when my first two or four medivacs pop, and place widow mines as close to the enemy base as I can. If it's close to the enemy ramp or third, then [fuckyeah.jpg](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/987/fyeah.jpg). I expand again behind this and try to bait fights. Widow mines work just like bunkers do when you 2rax, you can exit your safe zone and attack and then run back. My last game was against a GM and I won using this tactic!

* **TvT** - Reaper expand into Widow mines; safe against just about everything I have encountered. It's TvT so you have to adapt to what he does to win. I still tend toward marine/tank with some widow mines in there, but I don't get to play that many TvTs unfortunately. Reapers are reaaaally good against 1rax fe openings now, with proper micro.

* **TvP** - Good old TvP 2rax from WoL beta. If you push with your first marauder and 5 marines, you hit before MS Core is up or hasn't got enough energy and can't cast Purify. From there, you have to follow up with what is appropriate, but more often than not I just win the game outright because Protoss rely too much on MS Core Purify to hold off stuff.

Most of the Terrans I know in the beta tend toward mech strategies. I don't think these are the future because mech will get figured out eventually. But I see the potential of it, maxed out mech is *deadly*.

EDIT: I just want you to know how much your small little observations and thoughts about the matchups and tactics you've employed matter. There is SO much knowledge to be learned and collected, and if you just drop a tiny note with whatever you discovered was a good combo and why, please enlighten us! I've tried putting my own train of thoughts into my strategies, and would love if you did the same!

Anyway, my beta experience isn't that vast (I think I have about 55 games played now), so:

Even Stephano stated that lately (http://i.imgur.com/UTUXv.jpg (I know it's PvZ, but a lot of ppl said similar things about TvZ)).

Also many pro-players were/are complaining about Protoss and how difficult it can be to crush them.

I personally do not hear it too often the other way around.. Just no one complains about Terran being OP.
Only NightEnd said in a recent interview, that Terran is the hardest race by far, but the best though..
In fact, that is just one opinion.

I still remember JD, when starting to play SCII, saying, that Zerg, if played perfectly, is the best race. 
Is he right? - Could be: Zergs seem to dominate.. and so does Protoss, too. Just take a look at DH Buc.. Awful Day2, wasnt it? Sure, we had a Terran in GSL Final, but he is considered to be the best player ever in SCII until now. But what i want to say with that in general: The amount of Terran participants has reduced, as well as the amount of Terran winners (and even 2nd, 3rd, 4th place.)

How about the missing Terran amount in ladder? I do experience that every day. There are a lot less Terrans than a couple of month ago.

To sum it up: Are we as Terran are underpowered? If yes, how much? Do we get worse results than other races for the same effort?
How to deal with this problem, assuming that it is one actually?
What are the weaknesses, that Terran has - and maybe even: 
what is the strength we need to abuse?

It's extremely weak against 1-base builds other than cloaked banshee. Due to the early reactors it has fewer marines than a standard 3rax tech build, and has a later starport by about a minute.  

This was OK when people weren't used to the build and you could just stim up the ramp and win, but people are used to this and don't die anymore.  Additionally a standard 1rax fe gets a 3rd at around 10 minutes, but the Thorzain build can't get it until around 12 minutes.

So essentially you should always be behind in some way when doing the Thorzain build.  Seeing as it was only decent against a 1rax fe, I should just be doing triple CC when I scout as such.  It has more marines and better upgrades around the same time.  The only problem is I don't have any pro replays of triple CC in TvT to steal from.

Does anybody know of any vods or replays of triple CC in TvT?  I can already improvise a general build order just from experience in TvP, but I'd rather copy from a pro for the timing nuances in TvT.

First, we're in discussions with the mod team over at All Things Protoss to organize the (now long-overdue) tournament between the communities.  But before we set anything in stone, we wanted to know what thoughts the community has for the tournament.  So how would you guys like to see the tournament handled?  After we sift through the feedback to see what does and doesn't work, there will be a follow up post with the information, so keep an eye out!

Second, I'd just like to remind the community that one of the rules of All Things Terran is that fluff (memes, image macros, etc.) are not permitted.  I only recently realized that the rule disappeared from the sidebar at some point while we were sprucing the place up, so none of the fluff posts in the past few weeks, but once the rule is re-added to the list we ask that everyone respects and enforces it.  Sorry for the inconvenience this causes, and we take full responsibility for not having that rule clearly visible to all members of ATT.

If there are any other comments or concerns, feel free to post them in this thread, and you're always welcome to message the moderators.

I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend, and **gl hf**!",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,icon-rank-bronze,True,t3_zia8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/zia8z/community_feedback_post/,moderator

I often read guides and listen to advice that says ""Take your third when you know it is safe"", but nobody really expands on that.  In my plat world of starcraft, it is never safe for anything it seems and I'm usually just throwing my third down really late and praying that it isn't attacked.  How can I be more confident about securing my third?  I almost always open 1 rax FE in all my matchups, with the intent of starting my third around 9-11 minutes in my main, but it never really hits the ground until 14-17 minutes in most games.

Also, how should i go about defending it once it lands?  is a bunker of marines with a single turret good enough in most cases or should I be making it a planetary and using depot walls everywhere?",,False,self,t5_2tfht,False,,icon-rank-diamond,True,t3_zax06,http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/zax06/when_is_it_considered_safe_to_take_a_third/,

Now seems to be a good time to switch into more differentiated styles in the 3 match ups. I have watched Dignitas Apollo's videos, and while I learned a lot, I have a really hard time adjusting to the new playstyles. I guess there are two reasons for this: 

1) they're quite different from what I am used to, and I guess that is natural and will go away with time
2) a lot of the play in the videos comes down to his decision making skills which are a lot better than mine, this worries me a bit more, since its difficult for me to really get the game flowing and I feel like hitting a wall repeatedly

What would you recommend that I do? Should I stick to the Apollo videos or do you have recommendations for some alternative build order styles I should go for? So far I have only really tried bio, but I am open to trying out mech as well. Only thing I really don't want to do is to play all in or cheesy, since I prefer getting a strong foundation.
