1327491882.0,2741,self.photography,ovy78,I am a professional photographer. I'd like to share some uncomfortable truths about photography.,icanjusttypeanythi,4709,1968,954,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ovy78/i_am_a_professional_photographer_id_like_to_share/,"This is a throwaway because I really like you guys and this post might come across the wrong way to some folks who I think are awesome.

Which is all of you people.  I dig r/photography.  That's why I'm doing this here.

This is a long goddamn thing, I need to get it all down, I physically can't sleep without saying this to somebody, even if it's just typing it for my own catharsis.

This mainly has to do with the *business* of photography, rather than the art of photography. If you are a happy shutterbug who is damned good at shooting or wants to be and that's your goal, you don't need to listen to me at all.  This isn't about that.  

This is about doing it for a living.

I think some things need to be said out loud, for once, as least things that I've noticed:

**1. It's more about equipment than we'd like to admit.**

Years ago, I started with a shit film camera. The PJ playing field was divided between those who could afford fast lenses and bodies that allowed quick film loading and those who could not.  Talent meant not just knowing how to compose and expose a frame correctly, but also knowing how to trick your goddamn shitty equipment into doing what you want it to do.

Nowadays, especially those of you in college, the playing field is divided between those who can buy adequate equipment to get the job done, and those who can afford fucking MAGIC.  Let's face it: the asshole kid whose dad bought him a D3 and a 400mm f/2.8 is going to have a better sports portfolio than you when you apply to our paper.  You're both talented but we're too fucking cheap to provide equipment and so was your school.  As a consequence, he got all the primary shots he needed for an assignment in the first five plays and spent the next half-hour experimenting with cool angle choices and different techniques while you were still trying to get your 60D to lock focus quickly enough.  

True, you can't pick up a pro camera, set it to P mode and instantly turn into Ansel Adams, but if you're learning on the same pace as everyone else and you are trying to keep up because your equipment can't hack it, the difference will be stark, and frustrating.
  
**2. People are doing some unethical shit with RAW and nobody really understands or cares.**

Photoshopping the hell out of photos is a nono in photojournalism, we all know this. And yet I see portfolios and award compilations come to our desk with heavy artificial vignetting, damn-near HDR exposure masking and contrasts with blacks so deep you could hide a body inside them.

When I question anybody about this they say ""oh yeah, well I didn't do anything in CS5, just the raw editor in Lightroom real quick so it's okay, it's not *destructive* editing, the original is still there.""

It's not okay.

But it doesn't seem like anybody cares. Some of the shit on the wire services looks exactly the same so they got jobs *somewhere*.

That dude that got canned from The Blade for photoshopping basketballs where there were none?  He's found redemption- I remember reading an article where some editor says ""oh he sends us the raw files so we know its kosher now.""

Fucking storm chasers are the worst offenders at this shit.  Guess what he does now.  

**3. Many times, sadly, it doesn't even matter if your photos are all that good or not.**

We are in the age of the Facebook Wedding Album. I've shot weddings pretty much every Saturday for a decade and if there is one thing I've learned it is the bride paradox: people hate photos of themselves even if they are good, people love photos of themselves with people they love even if they are bad.

And that's totally fine.

Now that everyone has a phone with a decent camera or a little money for a DSLR with a pop-up flash, there exist an entirely new and growing population of couples who are perfectly happy employing their wedding guests as proxy paparazzi for everything from prep to ceremony to formals to cake to dance. They will like their photos better than ours. They won't last, they won't be able to put together a quality album, and they really don't mind.

Consequently, there also exists a class of photographers that saw how happy their friend was with the photos they snapped at their wedding in this manner and read an article on Forbes that said they could make $1500 a week doing it again and again if they wanted.  They make no attempt to get better, they spam the bridal shows with booths that are alarmingly tacky and worse yet they learn they don't actually have to shoot the thing themselves with they can pay somebody else to shoot the wedding at a third of the cost and pass it along.

And nobody cares.

My buddy, an excellent photographer that chooses to shoot mediocre but proven poses for senior portraits, yearbooks, weddings, school sports, etc.,.. makes something like $70k/year in Midwest money.  He's a really great photographer, but you'll never see the good stuff he shoots because it doesn't sell.  You shoot what the clients want.

More and more, you won't like what the clients want.

And that goes for news outlets, too.  ""User submitted photo"" is becoming the number one photo credit, it seems.

Nobody cares about recording history.  Nobody cares about documenting the events of our time for the future.  Just send us a low resolution .jpeg still frame from a movie you shot with your phone and that'll work if we get it by deadline because all the photographers are laid off.  Nobody seems to care.

I wish I could tell you I haven't seen it happen myself.

**4. Photography is easier than we'd like to admit.**

Here's something for you: I've been doing this for a long time.  I am an excellent photographer.  Give me an assignment and tell me what you want and I assure you, I'll come pretty fucking close to the picture you had inside your head.  I am very, very good at what I do.

You know what? You could learn everything I know in a few months.

Maybe less if you really focus on it.

That's it.

My knowledge, my experiences, all of it- from professional sports to weddings to news to feature to product to portraits..  A few goddamn months.

In college, I studied alongside classical artists like we were equals.

We were not.

**5. We need to stop being goddamn snobs and accept the coming of The Golden Age**

Remember that asshole kid with the $5k Nikon D3 whose portfolio was better than yours?  Guess how much that camera is going to sell for in say.. five years.

Would you believe $300?  $500, *maybe?*  That's all that body will be worth, if it's in good condition.  And that's if Nikon decides to keep repairing the shutters that will inevitably die by then.

Have you played with a D3?  That is a sweet goddamn camera.  That can do everything you need to do, right now.  Even ISO 6400 is beautiful.  A lot of cameras are like that.

Right now.

Imagine what will be $300 in ten years.

Everything is getting better.  Sony, Canon, Nikon, Pentax, everything is fantastic.  All of the future's crappy old stuff will be today's awesome new stuff.  And that means more people are going to be able to afford really great cameras that can do amazing things and we are going to see some amazing photography come from surprising places.

It's going to be awesome.

It may also be the death of our profession.

Of *my* profession.

If you want to be a photographer- wonderful, good, yes, do that, I can't recommend it enough.

But I do not think we will last.

Well, after ten years of desk jobs I threw in the proverbial towel to live out of a backpack for seven months while working towards a respectable documentary photography portfolio.  It's not lost on me that this was a privilege in the first place, and only by burning a bushel of my life savings, selling nearly everything, and subletting my place in NYC was I able to afford the means to AirBNB, couchsurf, WWOOF and hostel my way across 13 countries.  Highlights included negotiating with Syrian 'mafia' in Istanbul while following a story on the illegal trafficking of refugees during a photojournalism workshop, driving myself around Africa in a 4x4 for three weeks, working on a buffalo farm in Ukraine, trekking in Kashmir during Ramadan, and shooting a two week NGO assignment for the UNDP in Moldova.  

I got robbed of my camera equipment on day 5 of the trip on a bus in Chile.  Insurance eventually covered it and a buddy who was already flying down from NYC to meet me in Patagonia was able to make a last minute B&amp;H run and bring a replacement Canon 5D mark II.  Saved my ass.

I don't expect to ever make a living from taking pictures, and accept that postscript I'll return to a desk job.

Right now, I'm back in the states on part two of this life experiment - driving around the US and Canada for 3 months trying to work on long-term narrative stories.  Sleeping out of my dad's old car, camping and crashing with friends.  Glamorous stuff.

I knew there was something up when I was getting an incessant Creative Cloud email almost every week. I had no interest in it. But it is clear now you were trying to build momentum for the atrocity you now serve your customers with: perpetual servitude. 

If you're ok with this CC bullshit, ask yourself: Will I always have money to pay for it? Can times sometimes get tough for anyone? Do I want to lose access to the tools that I use for my job?

GIMP is no alternative. I've used it for years. It sucks. It just does. It is no viable alternative for power users.

Will this move help with piracy? No! In fact it will encourage it. The demand will be high for tools that fool the CC software into thinking you're subscribed. People might subscribe initially, but once they realise what a rip-off this is, how costly it is, and once the prices goes, they will turn to piracy to continue using the tools they intuitively thought they had purchased (of course they did not purchase anything, just rented).

If anything there's hope. This will help Adobe's competition. More and more people will be google searching ""Photoshop/Premiere/etc alternatives"" in the future. And you know what, those killer features in the upcoming versions? They're not so killer. Software already exists for 'deblurring', it is an active area of research.

All in all, I wish I had bought Adobe stock some time ago, because I'd love to sell it right now.

**Edit**: Let me put it this way. Adobe have recognised that their key products are *too good*. People are not upgrading as much as they should because there's not much incentive to spend money on an incremental improvement from something that's already pretty great. Their plan is to put all of their customers on an eternal upgrade plan so that this does not happen. The problem with this is that you, the consumer, are now at the mercy of their pricing schemes. Things may seem good now, but they want their customers on-board. Expect a price increase in a year.

I've been in the business for 7 years and have somewhere around 50 weddings under my belt.

I see it as part of my job to set the scene for you take the best shots you possibly can. I create the moments, you capture them. Whether or not you realize it, we're a team. There's no reset switch, we only have one chance to get it right. The better we can work together, the better the outcome is for everyone.

To help us work better together, here's some things I think you should know: 

* The best thing I can mention is communication. We need to have good, constant, open communication. When you arrive on location, find me, introduce yourself and lets hash out a game plan. I always have a printed agenda of my plans to give to the photographer. 

* This is also an excellent time to give me a few business cards. Aside from creeping on your your portfolio during the reception, I like to know who you are and know how to refer work to you. Trust me, I'd rather work with photographers that do great work and work well with me.

* Give me a list of things you need shots of and I'll make sure you're not in the bathroom before doing them. If you need a extra minute to prepare, let me know and I can delay. 

* If it looks like my lighting rig is going to throw you off, let me know before I turn them on. If time permits, I'd be happy to turn them on so you can get some test shots.

* My schedule is largely determined by what time you're contracted until. I understand you've been shooting since before noon and want to go, but please, let me know how much flexibility you have. As you know, sometimes things happen that are out of our control and cause events to get out of sync. Just knowing that you're willing to stay an extra 15-30 minutes if necessary is a big help.

* I'd really appreciate a 5 minute phone call or an email a week or a few days in prior to a wedding, just to make sure we're on the same page. If we need to discuss anything in depth, having the conversation an hour before the ceremony or reception starts isn't going to do either of us any good.

* I love getting recommendations for things to do during a reception (fun games, activities, etc), it helps me keep things fresh. 

* If you hear guests complaining about the volume or song selection while you're out shooting, let me know. If my voice sounds too loud or quiet when making announcements, let me know.

* I always have a small toolkit and spare batteries, just ask.

* Yes, it's okay if you store your gear bag behind my booth.

What about from your side? What can I do to make your job easier? What should I know?

None of them spoke English, save for the old lady, who asked if I could get the landmark behind them in frame as well. The camera was a Nikon DSLR with a kit zoom lens on it. I didn't think much of it, flipped it from auto to manual and dialed it in, got on one knee, and fired off a shot. It came out perfectly; they were all still clamoring to look at the tiny screen well after I'd walked away. As I left, the old lady exclaimed, ""You should be a photographer!"" Reminded me of why I take photos; because they bring people real joy. I'd spent so much time caught up in the technical and marketing aspects, I'd forgotten why I started in the first place.

In total 620 photos were submitted to the competition and over 10 000 votes were given.

We've gone through the entries and verified the top 10 photographs. The top 10 proved to be a very diverse bunch of photos, containing landscapes and portraits as well as photographs taken with digital and with film. Canon proved to be the most popular brand, with five of the top 10 being shot on a Canon, four on a Nikon and one on a Voigtlander. Two of the top 10 were shot on film.

All but one of the top 10 were shot with a wide-angle lens, ultra-wide angels being the most popular. ISOs and shutter speeds showed no real pattern, lower ISOs and faster shutter speeds were more common. Of the three photos with slower shutter speeds two were close to thirty seconds. We only had one photo at ISO 6400, the two follow ups were both taken at ISO 800. f/8 was the most popular aperture, and if you include f/9 then half of the top 10 were shot at f/8-9. Just goes to show that the age old saying of f/8 and be there is very much correct. The rest of the photos were shot close to the lenses maximum aperture.

But without further ado, here's the top 10 photographs, as voted by you. Starting with number 10:

And that's the top 7. With three to go, I thought we should know a little bit more about the photos, so, in the photographers own words I'll let them present their photos in their own words.

**Third Place**
&gt;This was shot in May 2012, as I tried to ski Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Europe, with a special somebody, who has since become my girlfriend. On the previous day, we skied to the Grands Mulets mountain hut, then got up at 2am to ski on the North Ridge of Dôme du Goûter, a harder but less exposed to serac fall route to the top. I shot this around 5am, as the sun was slowly rising. It's natural light only, and shows many of the surrounding mountains and Chamonix, my home, far down in the valley.
We didn't reach the summit that day, as Hulya became sick with altitude at 4200m and we were forced to ski down.

**Second Place**

&gt;I took this photograph on my last vacation in Morocco.
I went to Essaouira, a small city at the west coast of Morocco, that is especially famous for its beautiful and vivid port.
For two days I simply spent my whole time being in that port area, and one of the most fascinating things there were the thousands of seagulls that really gave this place an unique atmosphere.
When the sun started to get lower, and all these seagulls gathered at one place, I simply got my camera ready and waited.

**First Place, and the winner of the Your Best Shot 2012 Photography Competition**

&gt;As a field biologist with a passion for birds of prey, I have found myself working on a Ferruginous Hawk research project for the past two years.  These are the biggest hawks we have in North America, and for the most part, they are unusually shy for their size.  If you google the ferruginous hawk, you´ll likely find a picture of a beautifully white, large raptor.  The bird in my image however is a rare dark morph, 3 month old female.  She was abnormally large, and the reason we have her in hand is to place a VHF (very high frequency) transmitter on her in order to track her movements.  The transmitter weighs a mere 8 grams and since she weighs roughly 2000 grams, it likely didn´t bother her that much.  I wanted a picture of her that somewhat simulated her flight and while I was walking with her, I realized she would open her wings resemble some of the actions of flight.  I began to run with her in one hand, and my camera in the other, and was able to snap the picture I submitted.

Edit: Yeah I do have receipts, serials, etc. I will be sure to have them on hand. Also, does EXIF data contain the Camera's serial?

Update: shit got real! I setup a meeting with the guy, got his phone number and a description of him. He used an email with his real name. He left his name on Facebook with an open profile. I saw that guy before and knew he had to have been the one to steal it so i printed out his photograph for cops. Then I filed a police report with his name and reported the serial of my camera from a very nifty website that scans any of your pics for serials. This was to ensure that I had prior knowledge of the serial when they would recover the camera, so it had to be mine. I then arranged a meeting at a coffee shop a block frm the police station and had a friend lookout for when he arrived at the shop. The police department lent me two awesome undercover cops to wait near the coffee shop in an undercover car. I was hiding in the back of the car and letting them know when I would get a text from a friend informing me of perpetrator's arrival. I let the perp know I was gonna be late and that he should get a coffee or something, and to tell me how I would recognize Him. He obliges and I get an easy description of him for the cops and a text saying he had arrived. I then tell the cops "" book em boys"", (kinda, exaggerating), they roll in, arrest him, find a Gun on him!(turns out to be fake) and find out there is a warrant out for his arrest, under a different name.

1351258462.0,728,self.photography,124eyg,The best thing I ever did was sell all my pro gear and stop doing photography for a living,C250585,907,179,308,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/124eyg/the_best_thing_i_ever_did_was_sell_all_my_pro/,"Not too long ago I was working as a pro photog, shooting weddings and small commercial gigs. I shot professionally for about 3 years. The reason I originally got into photography is because I always wanted to shoot skiing, climbing, etc - basically adventure sports photography. However after spending $15,000 on photo gear over that time period and finally really sinking my teeth into it, I only had 50,000 wedding and industrial commercial photos to show for it. I realized out of those 50,000 photos, there was not a single photo that I actually liked. I hated all of them because they did not represent me at all. I never had any time or money to actually pursue any of the activities I actually wanted to photograph.

Long story short, I sold all my photo gear on kijiji and bought a little $300 Samsung EX1. I quit photography full time, and got a more stable career working as a web developer (something i'd freelanced in conjunction with wedding photography) to pay the bills.

I spent all the money I gained from selling my camera gear to purchase full ski touring gear, climbing equipment and mountaineering equipment and spent the last 2 years seriously pursuing those avenues. Now, I have only have a few thousand photos in my Lightroom gallery since switching, but i'm actually passionate about every one of them, even if some of them aren't all that great. 

For the first time, i've put my passions (the outdoors and adventure) first in my life, and allowed photography to follow. I've never been happier, and i've never been more proud of my photos. Has anyone else taken this leap?

My site is http://stoked.in - have a look if you like. 

**TL;DR money doesn't buy nice photos that you are proud of, passion does.**

* Message from Dave Morrow photographer: *""Hey thanks for bringing this to my attention, I really appreciate it:) Stealing digital images has become a huge problem lately especially since social networks have become such a big thing.

A professional photographer Hera Bell [Her google+ account](https://plus.google.com/114182221804001418544/posts), has been taking photos from the internet and posting them on her blog and claiming that they are hers.

For example here is a original photo by Petri Puurunen:
[http://petri.1g.fi/kuvat/_MG_9924_5_6_2.jpg](http://petri.1g.fi/kuvat/_MG_9924_5_6_2.jpg).
And here is a screen capture from her blog that has been taken down since, where was a slightly edited version of the [photo:](http://petri.1g.fi/HeraBell_photo_thief.JPG).
She says that it was shot with ISO50 velvia pushed to ISO100, although the original shot was a three shot HDR according to Petri.

Another example is a photo by [Daniel Wambach](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wambachdaniel/4093010377/in/set-72157622653199145/)
And here a google cache from her [blog](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:RRmhIJHp7ncJ:www.myphotoramblings.com/2009/06/grahic-studio-effects.html+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=fi&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=fi).
She says that ""It was shot with available diffused light. Camera was on tripod. Long exposure."" Yea right, that's the way to take a shot of a waterdrop.

Anyway you can read more about it on [dpreview](http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/post/50397989), where she stops by and says that she has all the original slides and whatnot. But what makes a PROFESSIONAL photographer do something like this? Is she really so stupid that she thought she could get away with something like this? I mean we have tineye and google images search that can easily track down stuff like this.  Jeez. 

**edit**: The Finnish photographers name is Petri Puurunen, not Petri Puuru. And here's a screencapture of his Lightroom library showing that he has many similar [shots](http://petri.1g.fi/LRarchive.jpg).

**edit 2**: Here's some the evidence that has been gathered so far by the unforgiving and thorough people from the Finnish photography forum [http://www.digicamera.net](http://www.digicamera.net/keskus/viewtopic.php?t=12704344). You'll be the judge:

1367860045.0,644,self.photography,1dsvwl,I took headshots of 80 people in one day. It hurt.,trackpete,788,144,273,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1dsvwl/i_took_headshots_of_80_people_in_one_day_it_hurt/,"You know that moment when you agree to do a favor for a friend and it turns into something a bit...  well, more? This weekend I ended up taking headshots of 80 people during six non-stop hours of shooting. Here is the story, what I learned, and some random thoughts on the experience. 

(giant wall of text, I just needed to vent to people that would understand!)

----

I'm not a professional photographer (I don't accept payment for my work), but I do enjoy it and spend quite a bit of time on it. A few months ago a friend planning a single day [DC area startup networking event](http://www.dayoffosterly.com/) asked if I'd be willing to spend two hours doing simple headshots of people who wanted updated pictures to use on their Linkedin profiles or bio pages.

I agreed because I've never had the opportunity to take photos of other people with a full studio style light setup and knew it would be an immense challenge and incredible opportunity to gain a lot of experience in a (theoretically) very low stress / low expectations scenario. I also like helping people out and seeing them happy about seeing a good picture of themselves, and we all know how much lighting matters there.

Finally, I realize that most people have no understanding of what it's like to work with a professional photographer or why it's worth paying someone for good work, and I saw this as an opportunity to plug professional photography services - give these people a taste and convince them to work with professionals (not me) in the future.

I discussed this with my friend and we determined I would set up and take headshots for two hours on a first-come first-served basis. We figured 10-15 people would be interested and I thought with ten minutes per person I would be able to at least get some usable shots. I would be setup in the corner of a ballroom without natural light with a white wall which I'd decide whether or not to use on the day.

I decided to use a continuous light setup instead of strobes for the main lights to avoid any annoying problems with batteries, remote triggers, etc. I tested out the light setup I use for video interviews and it worked well enough, so I built a [checklist of gear to pack up based on that](http://whoispete.com/dof_checklist.png). 

In order to avoid those frustrating situations where you think a photo is crisp on the camera LCD but find out it's shit on the big screen, I brought a laptop and a 24"" monitor so I could shoot tethered into the laptop and review the images quickly as needed. In testing, I found that Adobe Lightroom was way too slow for me to review the images in anything close to real-time, so I ended up shooting into the Canon EOS capture app for immediate review (2s vs 5s+) while Lightroom auto imported on the back end. All of this turned out to be moot though, as the sheer quantity of people and pressure of the pace meant I did 99% of the reviewing on camera.

Up at 7AM. Zipcar loaded and on the move by 8:30AM, on-site and setting up by 9AM. By 9:30AM I was all set up, everything test fired clean, and I decided to use the white background with a single strobe fired remotely onto it to lighten it up (Big Mistake #1: I should have used two, one from each side).

I was slated to start at 10AM, but at 9:45AM while joking around with a friend of mine someone came up to me and asked if I was ready to start shooting. I looked up and realized there were already nearly twenty people in line waiting for me...  and I hadn't even started.

The rest is a blur. For each person, I'd give them a card with a URL written on it where they'd be able to get their pictures later and give them a little speech about it. Then I'd have them [hold it up like a mugshot](http://whoispete.com/mugshot.jpg) so I could track them, after which I'd adjust the lights to get the best look for the individual. I'd give them a little speech about posing, then let them do whatever look they wanted while I took a few more shots to check and tweak the lighting. Once I was all set, I typically had them start with a serious look straight on, then joked with them to get some smiles, switch them to a slightly sideways shot, and call it when I was pretty confident I had at least a few good images. 

Some people required a LOT of help (especially those with massive forced grins), and I can't even remember how many times I asked people if they were pushing their tongue against their teeth. The most successful responses I got seemed to be from asking people to ""mean mug me"" which almost always resulted in nice little half smiles 'cuz apparently these people weren't mean. I had two subjects that knew exact what they were doing and I spent maybe sixty seconds on them and done, perfect photos - but I had a lot more people who I had to constantly coach and make comfortable and calm them down for a couple minutes before I could get anything.

At noon, after two hours, I finally looked up and was going to call it when I realized there were still nearly thirty people in line...  and they had already waited an hour or more. We determined I could keep the space for the rest of the afternoon and I just kept shooting. A friend of mine grabbed me some tacos and I ate one in a quick break around 1PM, a second around 3PM (when a nice gentleman insisted I take five minutes to do so), and the third when I was tearing things down at 4PM. I only stopped at 4PM because we were literally closing down the hall - I still had people in line and was desperately rattling off last minute pictures. 

When I got home, I counted it all up - just over 3,000 images of 80 people using up almost 80GB of space. I started sorting and preparing to edit and laughed as I checked my e-mail to find I already had a couple messages from people saying they'd gone to the URL I gave them and the pictures weren't there yet! Augh. 

I've spent around eight hours so far sorting and processing the images. I've finished the first forty people, so I'm halfway done. I was very glad to see that I got at least 4-6 good pictures of each person. Here are two contact sheets of the first forty people with my personal favorite images from each one (though some are just fun):

[Contact Sheet 1, People 1-20](http://whoispete.com/dof_set1.jpg)

[Contact Sheet 2, People 21-40](http://whoispete.com/dof_set2.jpg)

[Contact Sheet 3, People 41-60](http://whoispete.com/dof_set3.jpg) 
*(backdrop strobe batteries started to fade and they started doing weird things with the light during this set, and somewhere around 50-55 I had to move everything to the left about ten feet to make room for some other stuff scheduled at 3pm so lighting got a lot less consistent - and I started spending a lot less time with people to speed things up, less than 30 shots person on average during this set vs 40+ before)*

*last edit!*

----
Some things I learned:

1. When you're editing free photos of 80 people, you start making compromises. Big time. I simply could not be bothered to smooth out the background of each image, though I did at least mostly clone stamp out the lightboxes. These people have to be content with gray gradients.

2. Not having full control of your lighting conditions sucks. The main lights for the ballroom were orange/magenta halogens about 30 feet up that apparently could not be turned off. There was basically nothing I could do but shoot through it and try to drop it out as subtly as possible in post. When I started I figured it wouldn't be a big deal because I'd only have a few skin tones to fix, but when I went to edit 80 people I just gave up and accepted that no one is going to have a perfect skin tone. Damn orange lights. 

3. Always build in breaks to monitor your setup. I felt so pressured that I kept shooting non-stop. I didn't check how full my cards were, I wasn't monitoring my images in detail to see the strobe lighting up my backdrop falling off more and more as the batteries died, etc. This led to some awkward moments with someone standing in front of the lights as I had to switch cards or deal with stuff and stressed me out more than it should have.

4. I expected to have time to review images with each person and get their feedback, then maybe put them back in front of the camera to tweak things. Didn't happen. As a result, had no need to import images into Lightroom and all that was just extra overhead. People did like seeing their pictures, but it was just a brief check before I went on to the next.

5. On the other hand, having the images show up on a big monitor facing the line of people seems to have been one of the reasons I had so many interested people. I could at times get a feel for whether or not an image in a sequence was good because there'd be an increase in murmuring/commentary from the crowd who was watching the monitor. Weird feeling.

6. I did not stop to take a picture of my setup. Or the line. Or, well, anything. Fuck. This annoys me.

7. Whenever people see my photos, they often assume I'm a professional photographer. When I explain that I'm not, they always seem surprised. ""Why not?"" they ask. They always laugh when I tell them it's because I can't make a living taking pictures of people who think photos should be free. Sometimes, though, I saw the thoughtful look in their eye when I explained how much better the images would be if they got a true professional, worked with them, and paid a fair rate. I hope a few more photographers in the DC area will have some business in the coming months as a result.

Bleh. Thanks for letting me vent. If you read this, you cray.

*(edit to clarify: I don't take money because I'm not a pro and I want to deliver whatever I want - a pro works with you to get exactly what you want. It's not that I can't charge for my work, it's that I prefer the freedom of not being accountable to a client. I'm basically my own patron. I understand that not everyone can do this, and it's why I continually stress to people how much more they can expect from a good professional and why it's worth it to go that route, and tell them what rates to expect. Many people I've worked with have hired pro's as a result of this, when they wouldn't have considered it before.)*

*edit 2: Thanks /r/photography, you guys rock! What a great community here. I've loved hearing the feedback, responses, thoughts, and general discussion. You've all given me so much to think about! Hopefully this encourages more of you to share this kind of experience, it's clear everyone enjoyed discussing it. Booya!*

*edit 3: Added Contact Sheet 3 with People 41-60. Also, my buddy saw this thread (sup Adam) and gave me a call. We know each other well so he knows I was sharing this most because of how much I enjoy challenges and writing about them (he was going to join me for awhile on a six month motorcycle trip around South America until he tore his ACL), but his response was effectively ""none of us realized how popular this would be - now that we do, if we do it again, we'll make sure you make some good money."" So there you go.*

*edit 4: Added Contact Sheet 4, and [here is a link to an image showing the ballroom I was set up in](http://www.amrmounib.com/p384445184/h5e2c1548) - yes, I shot during the speeches and afterwards all those tables had people at them. All those people against the wall on the right side?

This past weekend, I finally returned - with a framed 11x14 in hand to give to the man in the photo (Dave). He was so pleased and excited - especially when he noticed that he could see his entire storefront and even the store sign ""vortex"" that he grabbed my hand and nearly shook it off my arm. He asked if he could pay me (I refused) and then promptly gave my ten year old an original series Batmobile collectible (in the box). I should do this sort of thing more often. :)


Edit: Just wanted to say thanks for the very positive reaction to this post. Also, maybe I'll take a moment to clear a few things up.


First, I'm not a professional in the full time sense of the word, although I do occasionally do some for hire work. Once upon a time I full time freelanced and decided to move onto a more 9 to 5 existence so I'd have more weekends with my family. Today, I am mostly focused on the fine art side of photography, with a sprinkle of street photography thrown in for good measure. 


I'd say, as a rule, I won't work for free when asked. However, I do offer to do some things for free when it feels right - and it certainly did in this case.


The photo was taken in an indoor used goods market (fleamarket). The shop was sort of carved into a darkly lit hallway. I discovered this place about a year ago and really enjoy people watching there, and found Dave particularly interesting. He seemed so in tune with his environment, and so satisfied with being there. I'd spoken with him a couple of times and found him to be very charming so, after the third time talking to him, I finally worked up the nerve to ask to take his photo. There was never any question in my mind that I'd be giving him a copy - it just seemed the natural thing to do as thanks for him being such a warm and willing subject. :)

The person making the request will usually mention ""credit"" as compensation for letting them use the photo, and maybe a free copy of the magazine.

The requests I am talking about generally go something like this:

*""Hi! I'm an editor for SuperAcme Magazine, a new ____ magazine with a print run of 100,000 copies every month! I found your photos of ______ on your flickr album, and I was wondering if I can get permission to use some of the photos in the next issue of our magazine. We would like to use your photo as a half page illustration for an article about your region. Of course, you will get FULL CREDIT at the bottom of the page, and we can also add a link to your website. Please contact me at....""*

Here is my experience with these requests:

**1) Photo credit is worthless.** If it attracts any attention to you as a photographer at all, then it will only be this kind: *""Hey this person is giving away photos for free! We should definitely contact them next time we need photos - and don't want to pay for them"".*

Basically, getting credited in some third-rate magazine is worthless. And the first-rate publications will offer to pay you anyhow.

**2) Don't even start discussing or explaining why you want money** for the rights to publish your photo. To any serious client, this is self evident. Trying to discuss this with one of those freeloaders only opens the door to annoying conversations, which are generally a waste of precious time because:

**3) 98% of the people requesting to use photos for free are not willing to pay ANY AMOUNT for your photos**, no matter how much you low-ball the price, or how much you explain why you should be paid.


So now, whenever I get one of those e-mails, I now respond with a standard copy/paste reply. Something along these lines:

*""Hello!
Thanks for your interest in my photo(s). I'll be glad to license the photo to you for publication in _______. My fee for a one-time use, non-exclusive license is $XXX per image for reproduction up to half page size, other sizes are priced accordingly. Please let me know which image(s) you require and in what size you wish to print them, so I can quote you a total price and send through a licensing agreement for your approval.""*

The price depends on who's asking. There are plenty of websites that offer advice about how much a license should be worth. Point is, I make clear that I know what the shot is worth, and I am not even thinking about giving anything away for ""credit"".

Realistically, I won't even get a reply 90% of the time. 8% of the time they'll try to convince me to give the photo away regardless, to which I reply with a brief ""thanks but no thanks"" kind of message. Maybe 2% of the time they want the shot bad enough that they will agree and pay.

Now, I'm not trying to make it as a pro or anything, I'm just a hobby-shooter with a job that allows me to take some fairly interesting photos occasionally. Basically, I'm not trying to make a living off this, but do like the extra cash paying for some of my gear at least....

I'd like to hear what everyone elses take on these requests is.

**Edit:** I got a lot of replies from people saying that they'd do it for credit because it's better than nothing and it'll help them to get at least a little bit of publicity. While I disagree with that for the most part (IMO the damage this does is greater than the benefit), here's a suggestion: If you are going to give away that photo to that magazine, at least make them give you ad space of equal size in return. If they are so sure that you'll get this amazing publicity from their publication, this should be no problem for them.

Saying it in a blogpost is one thing, but it isn't really legally binding. It is not the terms you agree upon when signing up for the service. I wonder if any of the journalists who wrote articles about this whole thing being hype ever read the new ToS?

I work as a professional photographer, I shoot events for corporations. I know a thing or two about rights to photos as this is what I do. Though my knowledge is based on Finnish law and not US law, so some differences may apply.

[If we take a loot at the new ToS for instagram which will go live January 16](http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/updated/) we can see the following paragraph, the first one under the title Rights:

&gt;Instagram does not claim ownership of any Content that you post on or through the Service. **Instead, you hereby grant to Instagram a non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use the Content that you post on or through the Service**, except that you can control who can view certain of your Content and activities on the Service as described in the Service's Privacy Policy, available here: http://instagram.com/legal/privacy/.

To those of you not fluent in the language of photographic rights, the bolded part means you give to Instagram  the right to sell or give your content (photos, text et. al.) that you upload to the service to anyone anywhere in the world and that they've already paid you for the right and won't provide you with any royalties from any potential profits. Ever.

There is also no part in their terms that state that this license will expire. There is this paragraph, number 2 under general conditions:

&gt;Upon termination, all licenses and other rights **granted to you** in these Terms of Use will immediately cease.

But note how it says that all the licenses and rights that have been granted TO you not BY you will immediately cease. IE that non-exclusive, fully paid and royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license you gave them when you uploaded that photo? Well they still have it.


Then there's this gem:

&gt;You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content posted by you on or through the Service or otherwise have the right to grant the rights and licenses set forth in these Terms of Use; (ii) the posting and use of your Content on or through the Service does not violate, misappropriate or infringe on the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark and/or other intellectual property rights; (iii) you agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owed by reason of Content you post on or through the Service; and (iv) you have the legal right and capacity to enter into these Terms of Use in your jurisdiction.

Whatever you upload, by uploading it, you tell instagram that you've got the permissions of any and all rightsholders to any and all trademarks or copyrights in the photos and or content you've uploaded and you agree to pay for any royalties fees or other monies owed if you don't have these permissions and someone sues instagram.

Combine this with the above paragraph and they've got the right to use your content whenever however wherever and to sell it to whoever; if Instagram gets sued for infringing on say one of Adidas trademarks that appear in one of your photos, YOU are liable for the damages. You give them your photos to use how they want and then they get to receive damages from you if they fuck up?

This is quite insane.

Some argue that these terms are similar to other photography or photo social networks, no, no they are not. I went to a few of the more popular ones to see what they said. This is what I found:

Here are similar clauses from other Photo related social networks:

[**Flickr / yahoo**](http://info.yahoo.com/legal/us/yahoo/utos/utos-173.html)

&gt;CONTENT SUBMITTED OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR INCLUSION ON THE YAHOO! SERVICES
&gt;
&gt;Yahoo! does not claim ownership of Content you submit or make available for inclusion on the Yahoo! Services. However, with respect to Content you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services, you grant Yahoo! the following worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive license(s), as applicable:

&gt;...

&gt;b. With respect to photos, graphics, audio or video you submit or make available for inclusion on publicly accessible areas of the Yahoo! Services other than Yahoo! Groups, the license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publicly perform and publicly display such Content on the Yahoo! Services solely for the purpose for which such Content was submitted or made available. This license exists only for as long as you elect to continue to include such Content on the Yahoo! Services and will terminate at the time you remove or Yahoo! removes such Content from the Yahoo! Services.

Note the lack of need to sub-license and transfer the license in the yahoo rights? These are by far the best I've read.

[**1x.com**
](http://1x.com/artist/1x/faq)
&gt;What rights do you claim over photos uploaded to 1x?
&gt;1x only claims the right to display your uploaded photos on our site. 1x.com also claims the right to display small thumbnails of your photos on other sites, like Facebook, linked to 1x. 1x does not claim the right to sell your photos if you have not decided to participate in print sales. All rights still belong to the original copyright holder. It is not possible to delete individual photos from 1x.com, but if there are legal reasons, contact support with your request and we will help you out. If you no longer wish to be a member of this community, you can request deletion of your account and all your photos will be removed after a grace period of three months, so you have the chance to change your mind.
&gt;
&gt;What rights do you claim over my high resolution files of published photos?
&gt;We don't claim any rights over high resolution uploads, we just store them. When participating in a book project, we will specifically ask for your permission to use a certain image. If you participate in print sales high resolution files are used for printing and might be used for marketing prints. You can remove a photo from print sales at any time by unchecking the checkbox in ""Account"" -- ""Print sales"". For extensive information about the terms and conditions for print sales go to ""Account"" -- ""Print sales"" and click ""read and signed the agreement"" to the right. Your high resolution digital files will never be sold or used for anything else than specified in the book and print sales contract if you have signed them.

No real terms on their legal page except for this FAQ.

A bit iffy, but as you can see here the license ends once you remove the content from the site.

The key difference for instagram is the inclusion of sub-licensable and a transferrable license. Something they definitely don't need to run a social network. The second *very* iffy thing is the lack of mention that the license will expire once you remove the content from the site.",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,1355924307.0,,pro,True,t3_153vsp,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/153vsp/i_think_this_needs_clarification_despite_what/,

**Photographing someone or somewhere kinda boring or plain? Want to punch it up with some cool vintagey or light leak lens effects without sacrificing quality of the over all image or using photoshop? Then try this:**

* Take two plastic sandwitch bagies, color one with a marker some bright color like pink or purple and leave the other clear. 
* On the opposite end as the zip-lock (the closed end) rip it, tear it or cut it in some uneven fashion so that it is now open on both ends. 
* Wrap the zip-lock end around your camera lens leaving the torn end overlapping the lens a little bit. Most of us are holding the lens while we shoot so now you are holding the plastic bag on the lens with your hand. 
* Now manipulate the bag as you shoot so the center of the lens is unobstructed and have fun!

clear baggie examples:

**[pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/jwoMMtf.jpg) [pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/kpfTUAC.jpg)**

purple colored baggie examples:

**[pic 1] (http://i.imgur.com/Zs2VmKX.jpg) [pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/oXAwMnE.jpg)**


of course you don't have to just use plastic baggies, have fun and try other stuff. Just remember that if you are using auto focus/white balance you will need to leave the center (or wherever you have set up your sensors) free of obstruction.

Ended up putting my Canon 7D on a short tri-pod, pointing it almost straight up to the sky, setting the camera on f8.0, ISO100, bulb and my 17-55 lens to 17 mm. I set it to manual focus/infinity. I also hooked up a wired remote with a long cable, since I had to light the fireworks myself.

Unfortunately it started to rain. Also, people starting cheering me on to light more fireworks, so didn't really have time to ""focus"" on my camera. My lens was getting really wet and I didn't expect the photo's to turn out ok, but I actually got this fake bokeh effect :) 

The next time I will get someone else to light the fireworks though.

1345326859.0,529,self.photography,yg1c2,"I just got accused of ""shoplifting"" for taking photos at a public craft fair.",waynemr,687,158,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/yg1c2/i_just_got_accused_of_shoplifting_for_taking/,"So, this just happened. I went to a local corn festival with my wife, two children, and mother-in-law. It has corn, carnival rides, shows, and crafts area for vendors to setup and sell their wares. The even was free, open to the public, and had no signs posted that prohibited photography. So, I was happily snapping away casual photos all over the place with my point-and-shoot, not even my DSLR. When we were finishing up the craft area, I thought it would be nice to do a panoramic shot. I was standing in the middle of the walking path, between all of the stalls and was figuring out where to start the shot and all of a sudden, this lady walks up and shouts ""no photography! You can't take a picture here!"" I calmly stared her down and informed her that I was at a public event and there was no posting that prohibited photography. Furthermore, I would do as I pleased. I think if I didn't have about three feet and a hundred pounds on her, she would have tried to snatch my camera. Since it was a nice day and I didn't much care, I didn't take the picture. But, the live view LCD was still active and she got in my personal space, pointed at the camera and screamed at me that ""this is SHOPLIFTING!"" at which point other people started looking over at the scene she was making. I told her to step away from me and again told her that I knew my rights and that taking a photo in a public space, at a public event, where there was no posted prohibition against photography was completely legal and she didn't understand what she was talking about. So then the says, ""why don't we just go talk to the police about it!"" Much to her surprise, I said ""Yes, I would like that, let's go talk to the police about it.""

So, after walking a bit, with her ranting nonsense about photographing her stuff being a form of shoplifting - I found a sheriff, manning the beer tent. I politely asked the officer, ""is it illegal to take photographs at this event, because I did not see any posting prohibiting it?"" to which he responded, ""no, you can take any photos you want."" The lady was not satisfied with this and stepped into the sheriff's personal space (bad move, in my opinion) and she demanded that I was shoplifting because I was taking photos of her designs, which I could copy and then replicate and sell. I actually laughed, and said ""that is the stupidest thing I have ever heard... I was taking picture of my wife and kids!"" At this time, my wife and kids actually caught up while she started to say ""your wife wasn't anywhere near you when you were taking pic..."" but she stopped short. You see, I am Caucasian, but my wife is South Asian and my kids are mixed. She had just assumed my wife and kids would have been white too. At that moment, she realized in fact, my wife and kids were right there, as I was taking their picture.

Taking the initiative to rub it in a little, I told her, ""even if I wasn't taking pictures of my family, I could sit there and snap photos all day, and that she should understand the law."" Still undeterred, she then asked the sheriff, ""if I tell someone to stop taking photos of my stuff, they have to do it, right?"" I already knew the answer and had a shit-eating grin. The sheriff responded, there is no law prohibiting anyone from taking a photo at a public event, even if you ask them to stop. It is the polite thing to do, though."" SO, I added, ""that is exactly what I did - I stopped taking pictures when the lady demanded me to stop.""

Unwilling to admit defeat, the lady made on last ditch effort to get a jab at me by saying, ""you don't have to be such a jerk about it and make me waste my time coming over here and not attend to my shop!"" to which I responded ""I! Did not MAKE! YOU! do ANYTHING! YOU! came over here on your own, because you falsely accused me of shoplifting IN FRONT OF MY FAMILY!""

At this point, the sheriff kind of rolled his eyes and said, ""I think everything has been resolved, you all have a pleasant rest of your day."" I thanked him, gave the lady a nice ""fuck you"" kind of smile, and left with my family.

In any case, if you have something you are afraid other people will somehow copy and duplicate, don't bring it to a public, free, family event where hundreds of people will be snapping pictures. And for goodness sake, don't claim other people are shoplifting - especially when one of them may actually know their rights.

I was hired to photograph a new outdoor patio area at a high-end hotel. The patio consists of several seating areas, gardens, etc. I spoke extensively to the hotel manager to ensure that there would be no cars parked in the shot, no people sitting in the patio area, garden lights turned on, etc.  

All was going very well...I completed the sunset shots as moved onto the nighttime shots. I had two speedlites, one hidden in a bush and another in a tree. I also had a monolight by the fountain. My camera was on a tripod as I was dragging the shutter a bit to let in as much ambient as I needed. I also had my other camera resting out of frame on a storage container.

All of a sudden, out of nowhere, I get sprayed in the face by a sprinkler. It caught me off guard but once I came to my senses I noticed that the sprinkler was directed right at me and my camera. I quickly grabbed the camera, moved it out of harm's way and started drying it off with my t-shirt.

Within a second, I started hearing the horrifying sounds of other sprinklers turning out...one after another. I scream ""OH FUCK!"" and start running around the garden grabbing each piece of gear which was getting wetter and wetter by the second. 

It looks like everything made it out alive but the experience shook me up a bit.

While some of them have improved over time, it's still tough on my heart to see people posting their new photos from ""Becca Sue Photography"" that are basically point and shoot shots. Christmas this year was especially bad with all the people sending their cards from their ""photo sessions"".

I think it must be the commercialization of DSLRs into mainstream, like it was in the 70s/80s, when everyone had film SLR cameras. Was there an influx of this kind of thing going on back then? Will it get worse?

An acquaintance of mine does paid weddings and she needed a helper, she's done over 120 weddings and offered a good paycheck for me for the day so I figured I'd fill in. I showed up with my 5d, 24-70, 50-f1.4 and 135-f2, stroboframe, flashes, wireless triggers, umbrellas, etc. She shows up with a Rebel T2i and a 18-55 kit lens... She was shooting in ""green box mode"", having lighting issues in the dark church. She asked me ""can you teach me how to shoot in raw mode"". I think we did a good job documenting the wedding anyways, I helped her a lot with lighting and technique, but for what they paid the couple should have gotten much more.

When it comes to hiring photographers, the general public must have a really hard time weeding through the lot of ""photographers"" available.

http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1cdfgr/delta_ended_up_breaking_around_8k_in_gear_today/

So just got off the phone with my renters insurance, and everything is covered. I'm getting a check minus my deductible sent to me next week so I can purchase all new gear.

I think what helped me out is that the three items were less than 5 months old, I have the receipt (since I ended up buying on amazon), and the case was broken into - the items weren't damaged from standard moving inside the case.

Obviously, I lucked out and I'm going to look into carry on bags that can hold all my gear (thanks for the links). HOWEVER - I think even if it was just through Delta damaging my gear from normal moving onto/off of the plane I think it'd still be covered.

If anyone's wondering, I have Allstate renters insurance (I made sure all my camera equipment was covered before I purchased it). It was only $180.00/year for a 30k policy with a $500.00 deductible. I recommend everyone who has any sort of gear get something similar to this policy as it's saved me a huge headache and a lot of money.

I'm just telling you what I got, maybe you can find something similar (no /r/HailCorporate bullshit going on), but I will say the entire process was absolutely painless. No arguing, no fighting for cash, and they're paying the adjusted price of the 5D body (I got it on sale).

So there's a happy ending to this story. Thanks to everyone for messaging/helping me out on the thread. I'm done checking any of my own personal gear on flights, and luckily everything worked out great.",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,False,,,True,t3_1coii2,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1coii2/follow_up_delta_ended_up_breaking_around_8k_in/,

1. After some experimenting, I took a [4-second exposure shot](http://krisvlad.deviantart.com/art/Together-304201389) at Daytona Beach that is currently my most popular photo on both deviantART and Flickr. I like the asymmetrical balance and the rich blue color. The blur-motion in the waves makes it look surreal too. 

2. This [horror/macabre type photograph](http://krisvlad.deviantart.com/art/Suffocate-283645230) was taken at an old courthouse in the bathroom behind some gassy-tinted glass. I like it, because it evokes a feeling of suffocation in me. I think the Sepia effect looks cool too. 

3. My [attempt at Fine Art](http://krisvlad.deviantart.com/art/Perch-273531382) received warm praise and recognition. I know it's not a very conventional photograph, but I wanted to focus more on the aesthetics rather than the practicality of such a simplistic shot. I used a black and white filter and increased the brightness and contrast to a point where the birds look like Vector art. 

So, show us what you have. Tell us how you took it and why you like it.

The system will allow for more image related content to be posted here while also reducing the need for a mod to preview a post before it goes live. Basically it comes down to this, we're changing the first rule on the sidebar to:

&gt;Photos are allowed when posted as a self post (text post) with the intent to foster discussion, or involve some sort of question (please link original sources).

This may result in more spam hitting the pages of r/photography so we're asking you all to be more vigilant with your down-voting of inappropriate content and equally just as vigilant in up voting the content you'd like to see more of. We'll continue to do our best to get rid of blatant spam but we appreciate your help in bringing those posts to our attention.

We're going to be trialling this change for a month to see what you guys think and how it affects the content of the subreddit.

/r/PictureChallenge is a long running subreddit with challenges posed by previous challenge winners. The submissions here are high quality and the challenges are often difficult but rewarding. This week's challenge is to compose a shot with a foreground, middleground, and background and can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/PictureChallenge/comments/1bwp9u/challenge_115_foreground_middle_ground_background/).

/r/photochallenge is a much newer subreddit geared towards newer and intermediate photographers. The challenges are selected to work on a specific skill or technique and constructive criticism and comments are encouraged.

If you do not agree please leave a comment instead as to why.**

Hello all!

In response to [Aeonblacks self post](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/j923z/vote_on_what_content_you_want_to_see_in/) asking you about what kind of changes you would like to implement in this subreddit we've now changed the rules.

The new rules, effective now are the following:

* Photos / blogs / your own photos are ONLY allowed if they foster discussion, have relevant content or involve some sort of question (these links must be the original sources). 

* Photo critiques, self-promotion or just showing off, are not permitted here - please try /r/pics, /r/itookapicture/, /r/photocritique/ etc. 

* Blogspam, Circlejerking, DAE, ITAP and karmawhoring is not allowed.

They've mainly stayed the same; we've tried really hard to keep them short and simple. The only major change is that we now DO allow photo posts within certain limitations. If you only want to show off a photo you should go to one of the appropriate photo sharing subreddits, however if you would like to start a discussion about a photo then you are allowed to post it. Just remember that you have to start the discussion too.

We're also going to reshuffle the sidebar and move things to the [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/photography)
 to keep the sidebar less cluttered and to be able to add things. This is not really done yet.

Also, last but not least vwllss has been added to the moderator team. vwlls has been a regular contributor to /r/photography/ for quite some time now and he's a very welcomed addition to the moderator staff.

If you have any comments or suggestions, please don't hesitate to post them!",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,True,,pro,True,t3_jjdco,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/jjdco/the_new_rules_stuff_of_rphotography/,moderator

I went to the store a few hours ago and got myself the 70-200 f/2.8L IS II. I've been saving up for six months (I don't have a job) for this... Anyways, as I leave I start using it and falling more and more in love as I use it. Cue 5pm and I hit up a mountain to take a few pictures of our town. Turns out, this is not something you want to do in Bergen, Norway. I got kicked in the back and almost broke my fingers trying to soften my landing. The asshole took my camera bag with my 70-200 and my 5D's charger. My camera slammed into the snow so my 35mm and camera only got a few scratches.

I dunno' what to do right now. I can't tell my girlfriend and dad (posting under a new account so they don't see this right now - other account is called ""whosawesome"" - I'm not a huge poster). They'd kill me after a few heartwarming hugs. I could sell my motorcycle I guess, but then I wouldn't have anything to drive around on. :&lt; 

Now I'm sitting here with not a single clear memory of the whole day. I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do now. I didn't see anything except the assholes back and my hardearned money running away. I won't be able to afford a replacement, and my plans for a studio will now be pushed back a long time.

Sorry if this post is a bit confusing. I could just use a hug or a couple of bottles of white wine.

I'm trying to get dozens, hundreds or perhaps thousands of pictures of the sky in different locations and it would be really appreciated if you could lend me a hand. This can be done on a phone, DSLR, it doesn't matter really. I assume that there are plenty of DSLR users here of course. Specifics are as follows:

- 2 photos - one at day, one at night.

- Pictures must be taken looking *directly* upwards - try to avoid having anything else in the frame if possible.

- Use whatever camera settings you find to be appropriate.

- No post-processing. *[Edit: When I say this, I'm just trying to avoid dishonest or destructive editing - the camera's processing and converting the photo to a jpg are absolutely fine. I'm just trying to avoid people adjusting colour to make up for light pollution or anything.]*


- Time, date, and location of the photograph.

Any help would be much appreciated - please either email them to madebyjosiah@gmail.com or post them here.

The photos will be arranged with their location, time &amp; date, each one about 1.5"" on a page and made into a one-off university project publication, one copy. It will not be given out nor sold. My tutor knows that I am not taking all of the photos myself. It will be photographed for my portfolio, but at no point will I be taking any credit for your efforts.

[500px](http://500px.com) is a vibrant online photographer's community, kind of the spiritual successor to Flickr but tuned more toward photographers.

As a photographer and a data addict, 500px is **interesting**. In this analysis we continue looking at [the little EXIF box of camera settings and equipment](http://i.imgur.com/cQ2oHTb.png).

If you missed the last part in the series, please give it a glance as to the background. (*tl;dr: EXIF data from 20,019 top [""Popular"" photos on 500px](http://500px.com/popular) as of 2013-02-06 was scraped, and we look at some patterns and trends.*)

---
**The Exposure Triangle, and Focal Length**

In this part 2 of the series, we leave equipment aside and look at the aggregate data of the exposure triangle used to take 500px Popular photos.

---
**Analysis of Aperture**

Other than focal length, probably the most important creative control. Let's examine what apertures are most commonly seen in this dataset.

* **[Aperture, as listed by category](http://i.imgur.com/Hm98lV1.png)**
* **[Aperture histograms, for Landscapes, Nature, People, Animals categories](http://i.imgur.com/5NbxSJ2.png)**
* **[Aperture histograms, for Architecture, Street, Sport, Macro categories](http://i.imgur.com/ZyQOJeZ.png)**

In case you haven't seen a boxplot before, I have annotated the first figure. You can see that Family, Fashion, and People are the category types that shoot most often wide, wide-open. This won't come as a surprise by itself, but this really quantifies the difference.

For Family shots, the middle half of all shots seem to have been made between f/2 and f/4.5. Realistically, not many shots are really made slower than f/11 or so. This is similar for People, for which half of all shots seem to have been made between f/2.8 and f/6.2.

Sport, Animals, and Nature all fall somewhere in-between the two extremes, with the most middle-of-the-road f-stop hanging somewhere between 4.4-5.6. This number does not elevate until you get to the Travel, City and Architecture, Concert, and Landscape categories.

For Landscape, the most commonly used f-stop is f/8, and the middle bulk of all shots seem to have been made between f/5.6 and f/12.

Of interest here is how many People shots are done at f/1.4-2 - wide open, for many lenses, just for the sake of depth of field. This may be for the crop bodies, who needs about f/1.8 to get to an FX f/2.8 amount of depth of field.

Also, Animals have its main spike at f/4 - no doubt from f/4 long-focal-length lenses.

---
**Analysis of Focal Length**

Another big factor in framing and composition, of course, are the focal lengths. What kind of focal lengths are shot for which categories?

* **[Focal length, as listed by category](http://i.imgur.com/40HFXPh.png)**
There are some extremely wide-angle wedding photos in this set. But then, the wedding set is very small, so I'm going to stick to commentary on the other categories.
* **[Focal length histograms, for Landscapes, Nature, People, Animals categories](http://i.imgur.com/XdtT3qr.png)**
* **[Focal length histograms, for Architecture, Street, Sport, Macro categories](http://i.imgur.com/1rtRcBE.png)**

City and Architecture, Landscapes, and Travel used the lowest focal lengths in this dataset, mostly using the 8mm-24mm range. In the meantime, Animals, with a whopping median focal length of close to 300mm, takes the cake as the type of photography with the most demand on zoom. The graph does not show it for clarity, but its top 25th percentile reaches high beyond the 1200mm level.

---
**Analysis of ISO**

Probably the least important control, it still is worth seeing.

* **[ISO sensitivity, as listed by category](http://i.imgur.com/1si1cg4.png)**

It surprised me just how uniform this is, across most categories. The median used ISO speed here is 200, with most ""middle half"" of photos not deviating from ISO 100-400. Though it is used, ISOs of 400-3200 compose a relative minority of all photos across all categories other than Animals and Performing Arts. For Animals/Wildlife presumably the increase is due to the necessary shutter speed, whereas for Performing Arts real low-light conditions are being encountered.

ISO speeds of 6400 and above are rarely ever used amongst Popular photos.

---
**Aperture/Shutter Speed Combinations**

What happened to shutter speed? Well, it was reserved for these. This section was by far the most fun to make.

These are ""heatmaps"". From Blue -&gt; Green -&gt; Yellow -&gt; Red, the progression of colors indicate how often that particular combination of Aperture and Shutter speed was used.

So that outliers don't kick the most bulk of the data out of the frame, I have limited all displayed data to between f/0.7 - f/32 for aperture, and 250s - 1/8000s for shutter speed.

* **[A v. S heatmap, all available Popular data](http://i.imgur.com/NjFkyl5.png)**
* **[A v. S heatmap, for Landscapes, Nature, People, Animals categories](http://i.imgur.com/PHZNGhO.png)**
* **[A v. S heatmap, for Architecture, Street, Sport, Macro categories](http://i.imgur.com/vJlgMLh.png)**
* **[A v. S heatmap, for BW, Travel, Fashion, Fine Art categories](http://i.imgur.com/rtLyDPd.png)**
* **[A v. S heatmap, for Urban Exploration, Still Life, Abstract, Transportation categories](http://i.imgur.com/zg3yOP7.png)**

This is a very revealing set of images. 

1. You can identify clusters of the most popular shutter/aperture combinations for each category of images. For example, in this set landscapes and architecture are most often done at f/8-11, 1/250. But you can identify another few clusters - at far-stopped-down apertures of f/11, f/16, and f/22, with longer exposures of 1/2s - 30s.
2. You can identify some common creative boundaries of categories of images. Know what is common, and what bounds to push. Street photos appear to be captured between f/4-f/5.6, and 1/500-1/60, which would be slow enough for some motion blur that is sometimes seen in many Street images. On the other hand, from the heatmaps you can clearly see it is going to be very rare to see a long-exposure People photo, or a long-exposure Wildlife photo, though it can be done.
3. You can identify whether a particular category is Aperture-prioritized or Shutter-prioritized. Horizontal ""streaks"" of clusters would indicate that the shutter speed matters more than the aperture for that particular category, or that there are a wide variety of creative scenarios that can be framed with different apertures. Whereas, vertical streaks would indicate that Aperture (or a certain lens type) was more important than the exact shutter speed, or that many shutter speeds work for that particular image type.

**End of Part 2**

If you see any interesting patterns in the data, or have any interesting interpretations of the data, please comment and let me know. And like last time, if you want to see any particular data combination, have any questions, or even just to ask ""hey, what is that one Animals photo that's strangely a long exposure?"", comment as well.

*I will be out of town later this week, so Part 3 will have to wait til the later part of this month. Part 3 of this series will examine some longitudinal trends. That is, what has changed between photos uploaded 2-3 years ago and the latest Upcoming photos of this month?*

I'm a photographer from Perth, Western Australia. Recently one of my old photography lecturers sat in at a court hearing in regards to his photographer friend who was being charged with ""Disorderly behavior causing offense by taking photographs without consent."" This happened in a public place on new years night, it was in the city.

Firstly I think that what's happened to this guy is completely out of hand. I don't see how the law can work like this. After reading and discussing this with many other local photographers we've realised that this is a hugely moral grey area and I would love to hear other photographers opinions on the matter at hand.

Have you been in this situation? Or know of any photographer who has? I want to gather opinions and ideas on what can be done to resolve issues like this in the future or how anyone has gone about being charged for something silly like this? 

In my opinion this could really create a huge issue for street photographers, or anyone with a camera in public. The 'shoulder shark' of photography, if you will, always looking over your shoulder to see if your doing things right and that no one is offended. Seems like a very unnecessary burden. 

I honestly think the law has gone power tripping but that's just me, I really want to hear other peoples opinions on this!

**ORIGINAL Story from Julian Tennant - Photography** (http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=506341452762426&amp;id=114370208626221&amp;comment_id=73731284&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=137&amp;notif_t=feed_comment_reply)
http://www.facebook.com/pages/Julian-Tennant-Photography/114370208626221

&gt;""Photographers! Possibly a very dangerous legal precedent has just been set. Read and consider the implications
&gt;
&gt;I've just left Perth Central Court after sitting through the trial of a photographer friend and colleague. He was charged with ""Disorderly behavior causing offense by taking photographs without consent"" after an individual objected to him taking photographs, possibly of his girlfriend, without permission whilst out celebrating new years eve at the start of this year. 
&gt;
&gt;The photographs were taken on my friend's iPhone and were amongst several captured whilst out celebrating the night. They were taken in a public space and the photographer did not engage in any furtive or dodgy behavior (ie no upskirting or similar sneaky attempts to see things that shouldn't be seen). The CCTV footage tendered to the court merely showed him sitting there snapping away from time to time. 
&gt;
&gt;So, as he is doing this, a guy who appears slightly intoxicated and obviously belligerent, confronts Al, grabs his phone and heads off. Al follows and finds the guy handing the phone to some policemen nearby and complaining that Al is taking photographs without asking permission of the subjects in the photos. The police inspect the images and ask if they are his pix and furthermore why he has not sought permission?
&gt;
&gt;Al responds by acknowledging that he took the photographs and points out that as he was in public space he does not need to seek the subject's consent as their is no right to privacy (from photographs) under Australian law whilst in public and it was quite obvious to all that he was taking photographs, so he has committed no offense. 
&gt;
&gt;The policeman obviously disagreed and according to the prosecution statement today, took him into custody ""for his own protection"" as the guy who took Al's phone and his mates were obviously upset by Al's behavior. 
&gt;
&gt;Anyway, arrested, charged with 'Disorderly behavior causing offense by taking photographs without consent'. 
&gt;
&gt;So, he goes to court today and we view the CCTV footage which clearly shows Al sitting down chatting to his mate and every once in a while snapping a photograph. From the footage and by any reasonable measure, there was nothing that would ordinarily be considered 'disorderly', furtive or disruptive in how he was behaving. As the magistrate pointed prior to adjourning to consider his verdict, he was of the opinion that there were many more disorderly people in the CCTV footage than Al. 
&gt;
&gt;Back in court at 2.15. The magistrate talks about the Surveillance Devices Act and how that does not apply in this instance. Also confirms that under Australian law and within the circumstances of this case, Al did not need to seek the permission of the subject to take their photographs. Nor could they expect not to be photographed. So, no offense committed there. 
&gt;
&gt;However... and this is where it becomes scarey for us photographers. Some members of the public did object to him taking photos without permission and one photo in particular, even though he did not try to disguise what he was doing and the subject was quite happy to be in public dressed in the manner that she was. As a result his behavior did cause offense and so could be considered disorderly, so found guilty as charged. 
&gt;
&gt;The magistrate said that he felt that there could be more clarification regarding photography and where the line is drawn... I got the impression that he was suggesting an appeal so that it could be further tested. But on the CHARGE presented to him, ""disorderly behavior causing offense"" the prosecution's case was proven beyond all reasonable doubt. And as an aside, I don't think Al's pockets are deep enough to mount an appeal so this precedent stands to be considered in future cases.
&gt;
&gt;So, what does that mean for us photographers? Well, on the face of it, the basis that people don't have an inherent right to privacy and can be photographed in a public place does not change. HOWEVER, if somebody objects to having a photograph taken and is of the belief that the act of doing so in inappropriate or illegal (regardless of whether it is or not) then the photographer may find themselves in court charged with a 'one shoe fits all' type of charge such as disorderly behavior and as happened in the case today, found guilty. 
&gt;
&gt;Think about the implications of that, particularly if you are a street or documentary photographer.""

**TL;DR** - Photographer takes photos on iPhone whilst out celebrating New Years. Some guy complains that his friend is in photos without permission. Said guy takes phone off photographer and takes it to Police. Photographer is arrested and later found guilty of ""Disorderly behavior causing offense by taking photographs without consent"". ALL IN A PUBLIC PLACE!

Currently it is doing an OK job but it could be so much better.

There are a lot of things missing that simply wouldn't fit in the character limit of the sidebar.

What I would like to do is remove all the content under the links ""What camera or lens for me?"", ""Photo techniques"" and ""Usefull reddit links"".

Instead I propose we move the content to the FAQ and make the headlines in question links to the relevant part of the [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/photography). That way the answers to the questions would be much better and we could link to relevant discussions as well.

Anyone some submission karma can edit the FAQ.

I've already gone and made some changes to the [FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/photography) including listing all the known (to me) photography related subreddits in subscriber order.

I've also got another idea that might help with the amount of downvoting of ""noob"" questions; I propose that the most basic questions about cameras or lenses where the OP has done no research himself should be removed and then re-directed to the FAQ by the mod who removes the submission and asked to re-post his question after reading the FAQ.

This would a) remove a lot of annoying questions b) hopefully provide the person asking the question a much better and comprehensive answer than what the average gets now and c) in the long run get more people to read the newbie questions and give answers instead of just downvoting them.

**500 Pixel Preferences**

As a photographer and a data addict, [500px](http://500px.com) is **interesting**. In this analysis we look at [the little EXIF box of camera settings and equipment](http://i.imgur.com/cQ2oHTb.png). Of course, equipment after a certain point doesn't matter much - but it's still fun to look at trends, preferences, and the general market of a slice of the photography community.

500px has done a bit of this themselves, actually. In their own [media kit (pdf)](http://static.500px.net/media/500px_mediakit.pdf) (page 9) they list the most popular cameras among 500px.com users. But the data work wasn't very well done. Camera entries weren't merged (500D and T1i were separate entries); no other analyses were done; and besides, it was only done once, and in 2011.

Lots change in 2 years, so I wanted to see what I can see off of the most [Popular](http://500px.com/popular) images, right now, in 2013. What cameras are most popular today (among this particular userbase)? In what categories? What focal lengths and aperture are most popular in different photo categories?

**The Dataset**

So I scraped the 500px ""popular"", most highly-""pulsed"" images with a [little script](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11738452/fivephotofast.R) I whipped up. The data was then, within reason, uniformized after a bunch of regex.

The result is this: **20,019 top ""popular"" photo entries** [(pages 1-1002)](http://500px.com/popular) as they were on 2013-02-06, and their associated EXIF information, if present.

**What Pictures?**

* [# of Photos by Category](http://i.imgur.com/Cd5IK7F.png)

Know your target market?

At nearly 6600 (33%) photos, Landscapes are 1/3 of the most popular photos on 500px. The next most popular category is Uncategorized, with 15% of the photos. Then Nature (11%), Animals (8%), Macro (8%), City and Architecture (5%), People (3%). These 8 categories alone cover 90% of all pictures popularized on 500px.

**What Cameras?**

* [# of Photos by Camera](http://i.imgur.com/gleho9J.png)

4055 photos of those sampled did not have tagged camera information, which leaves 15,961 tagged photos.

Of those, the 5D II clearly dominates as the most used camera to take the most liked 500px photos - a whopping 1,488 (9.3% of all tagged photos) in that sample set. The two flagship crops take the next two places, at 1005 photos for the 7D and 902 photos for the D7000. The first Nikon full-frame makes its appearance as the D700, at 608 shots and 3.8%.

**Does this change by the type of photo?**

* [# of Photos by Camera, Landscapes only](http://i.imgur.com/7ihDtgJ.png)
* [# of Photos by Camera, Animals only](http://i.imgur.com/CPuPfRd.png)
* [# of Photos by Camera, Macro only](http://i.imgur.com/xW4p9Ir.png)
* [# of Photos by Camera, People only](http://i.imgur.com/AX7lULo.png)

As you can see, absolutely! While the top cameras for Landscapes are pretty much the same as the net overall (Landscapes are 1/3 of all pictures, after all), all the common wisdoms are pretty much confirmed by the other data sets.

For Animals, the crop 7D dominates at 11.3% of all sampled photos. The 5d II barely makes 2nd place, to be followed by more crop bodies - D7000 (#3) and 50D (#4)

For Macro, the D90, 7D, 60D crop bodies clean #2-#4, while the first place is held in fact by the DSC-W50.

For People, the first 3 places are taken by full-frame sensors - highlighting the popularity of the shallow depth of field. The top places are 5D II, 5D III, and D700. This is followed by the D90.

**What about manufacturer market share?**

* [# of Photos by Manufacturer](http://i.imgur.com/EOWx5tI.png)

* [# of Photos by Manufacturer, Animals only](http://i.imgur.com/cdnVGYW.png)
* [# of Photos by Manufacturer, Macro only](http://i.imgur.com/L8HTPWY.png)
* [# of Photos by Manufacturer, People only](http://i.imgur.com/ydbctdv.png)
* [# of Photos by Manufacturer, Street only](http://i.imgur.com/bfVYjDu.png)

In general, not too much. The general trend seems to be Canon dominating ~50% of the known market in the sample, followed by Nikon at a bit below 50%. The rest of the manufacturers follow, at a much reduced rate of use.

*This ends part 1. If people like this one I'll do one on Apertures and Focal lengths. And of course anything else that you'd like seen done with this dataset.*

**EDIT: I have only a few minutes right now and I'll put up my data and scripts:**

* **[The dataset](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11738452/alldataclean.csv)**, which contains ID, Camera, Lens, Focal.Length, Shutter.Speed, Aperture, ISO.Film, Category, Uploaded, Taken. It's not very big and is in .csv, so it's compatible with everything including Excel. You may need the clean-up script as listed below though.
* My short script for **[cleaning the 500px data for the Camera categories](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11738452/clean500pxdata.R)**. It (tries to, within reason) cleans up the tagging by merging all the NiKoN cAnOn capitalizations, with and without EOS, gaps between D ####, dashes between NEX-[357], and all that. It's not perfect and definitely can be improved upon. Especially for Pentax and Olympus cleaning, and there are a lot of camera names I don't even know what to merge with. I'll probably improve upon it myself later. The language is in R, but it's in pretty standard regex so it can be adapted to sed, perl, python with minimal difficulty.
* As posted above, **[my scraping script](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11738452/fivephotofast.R)** for getting data off of 500px gallery pages. As [UltraHex](/u/UltraHex) suggested though, [the 500px API would be an easier way of doing it](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/181r1s/a_fun_look_at_the_500px_popular_photos_part_1/c8ay42l) if you want to make your own.",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,1360270695.0,,,True,t3_181r1s,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/181r1s/a_fun_look_at_the_500px_popular_photos_part_1/,

Anyways, [here is one of my favourite pics I've taken when it comes to composition.](http://behance.vo.llnwd.net/profiles9/1251993/projects/4242289/hd_6ec287474bae85979c0ab761d13c74e9.jpg)  

To be fair it's not just the composition that I like, but also the emotion that comes through the body language.  I have other pics that I think are more solid when it comes to composition, but they don't have the same impact.

**Edit: What a great response!  So good to see so many people's work on here.**

So last night, after work, I decided to go to Gore Park in Hamilton, Ontario to do some picture taking.  They have a beautiful fountain, and a statue of Queen Victoria, plus lots of neat little gardens and such. 

The area has quite the character, plus a few buildings are being torn down soon so I wanted to capture that for posterity.

So I am taking pictures away.  Some of people, but mostly of the statue at this point.

All of a sudden a guy is in my face asking if I took a picture of him.  I said no (not consciously anyway - he may have been in the frame), but if I did accidently, I am sorry.

He demanded to know who I work for (answer was no one) and what I was taking pictures of.  I said anything I found interesting (probably bad thing to say)

He said what I was doing was illegal and he was going to call the cops.  I said there is nothing illegal here and go ahead and call the cops.

I walk away and take some pictures of the fountain.  At that moment there was a really cool rainbow effect in the water.  After a minute or two the guy is in my face again (he followed me).

He demanded again to know who I was working for.  I said no one and please leave me alone.

He said he is going to call the police.  I said go ahead, please do.  Nothing is illegal here, this is a public park, and I am taking pictures on public property.

He yells out that I am a pedophile and starts going to all of the people around the fountain pointing to me saying I am a pedophile and taking pictures of all of them.

I said (believe it or not I didn't yell once) that this was a public area, there is nothing illegal, leave me alone.

He yells more.

I told him he was fucked up and to fuck off and leave me alone or I will call the police.

He just stood there staring at me.  I stared back.  An impasse, or standoff if you will.

In my head I thought he was going to kill me so I was getting out of there.

I turned and left.  Kept looking over my shoulder to make sure he wasn't still following me.  He wasn't.

So that was my first foray into taking pictures of subjects that are not my daughter, or things in my driveway.

Oh yeah, unrelated, but two hours later, my wallet was stolen.

I'll see if my dad had time to sit down and answer a few of your questions with me, and maybe add some new facts to this thread. My dad is also an optical engineer and knows quite a lot about my grandfathers work. Ill try to reply to comments tonight! 

Hello!

I figured I'd share my grandfather's work here, because I'm sure it will be appreciated here. My Grandfather was Dr. Erhard Glatzel, and he designed optics for Carl Zeiss back in the day. His more famous design was sent to the moon and provided the first pictures from the moon. You can read a bit more about his work here:

http://www.zeisshistorica.org/Glatzel.html

My grandfather passed away before I became interested in photography, but once I began taking photos, I was lucky enough to acquire his Contax RTS, (which I think he was given as a gift by Yashica or Contax)  and some of the lenses he had designed. We don't have many photos of my grandfather, as they are all back in Germany at my grandmother's house. There were some really cool ones of him at meetings and what not. 

Anyways, just thought I'd share!

Here's a a few quick shots I snapped.

Obviously, the above pic is a picture that I took of the tintype portrait by Michael Shindler, the real portrait only exists on a 4x5 piece of metal. I didn't alter the tonal qualities at all, I just tried to white balance for it to look like it does in real life, with a slight sepia look.

It was quite a cool experience. Because of how shallow the depth of field is, I was surprised to hear that he shoots at an f-stop of 5.6. I didn't know that on large format cameras there is shallower DOF. 

The coolest part about tintype is that it's actually a negative, and it's a mirrored image. I asked a girl who worked there how it was possible for a negative to look like a positive, and it's basically because the metal that the emulsion goes on is black. She showed me a tintype taken on shiny silver metal, and all the shadows of the picture were shiny silver. I'm still wrapping my mind around how it works, so if anyone can explain in further detail, please do. 

The types of chemicals used make these tintypes are especially sensitive to blue. That's part of the reason why my eyes stand out in the picture. My shirt was blue, and it came out much brighter than it looks in real life. It's also interesting how much the freckles on and around my nose stand out in this photo. I honestly didn't know I had freckles, so something about this process really brought them out. Lastly, my facial hair appears much darker in this photo.

I'm most excited that this photograph will last for hundreds of years. I wish I could say the same about my massive collection of digital photographs.

Would just like to share some thoughts.,dybuell,372,53,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1dw4nh/today_marks_my_first_full_year_as_a_professional/,"Today marks my first full year as a professional photojournalist. I was hired a few weeks before I graduated from college last May at the [State Journal](http://www.state-journal.com/) in Frankfort, Kentucky. I graduated on a Saturday, moved down on a Sunday, and started work Monday.


I've kept 11,576 photos in this past year. I've probably *shot* at four times that.

 I’ve been able to shoot a wide variety of great events. Important political figures, such as the [governor](http://i.imgur.com/Ewb9yUA.jpg), and Senators [Rand Paul](http://i.imgur.com/YnKJR6L.jpg) and [Mitch McConnell](http://i.imgur.com/2JHpwI5.jpg). [Various rallies](http://i.imgur.com/39qFl2L.jpg) and [news events](http://i.imgur.com/BIH14oy.jpg). I’ve covered dozens of (warning - blood) [accidents](http://i.imgur.com/qiHgXR3.jpg) and [fires](http://i.imgur.com/bisAw3a.jpg). Then there’s the 173 sporting events, ranging from [high school standouts](http://i.imgur.com/9z9nZYj.jpg), [SEC football](http://i.imgur.com/LK61zAh.jpg), [Kentucky basketball](http://i.imgur.com/SFedTnK.jpg), the [NCAA Tournament including champion Louisville](http://i.imgur.com/Bwgd8Ww.jpg), and this past weekend, the [Kentucky Derby](http://i.imgur.com/1dOwxy8.jpg).

I’ve met a lot of great people and made some awesome friends in my co-workers. I’ve been able to go places and see things most people don’t, such as the [roof of the Capitol](https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/904411_10151321716505895_457870252_o.jpg) (that's me up there). Hell, I’ve even seen a [mailman get attacked by a dog](http://i.imgur.com/Day6dGx.jpg).

I[ won](http://i.imgur.com/JziBrCz.jpg) five[ Kentucky](http://i.imgur.com/YJPRfA7.jpg) News Photographers Association[ awards](http://i.imgur.com/uRIdWzt.jpg) (two were a group award with my co-worker photographer). Not bad for a kid in his first year who never took a photography or photojournalism class in his life.

It’s not easy though. It’s an tiring job. The hours are long, the exhaustion can drain you, and sometimes you have to sacrifice your body to cover a story. I’ve twice hopped a barbed wire fence and ran two miles down an interstate to cover wrecks, and both times gotten poison ivy as a result. You never know when a wreck, fire, or natural disaster will hit, so you’re on call every minute of every day. And then there are some things you see that most people don’t want to see.

It doesn’t pay much, but most people I meet are friendly and glad I’m there. I’ve received more good feedback than bad, so it’s reassuring that I’ve chosen the right career path.

The biggest thing I can take away from this past year is the progress I’ve made. I’ve made more progress in this year than the three years I shot in college combined.

In the end, despite the exhaustion and stress, I can’t think of a better place to be right now. Every day is different, and you never know what’s going to pop up. The job has taken me many more places than I would have originally thought, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me next.

Is this for everyone? No. But it’s exactly for me.

Sorry if it sounds like I'm bragging. Not what I intended.

okay, so here is the tip: get the smaller/lazier eye *slightly* closer to the camera. oh, and don't tell the person what you're looking at their eyes for! you'll make them self conscious. simply ask them to look at your finger and move their head to follow it, and then guide them left or right as necessary. chances are, the movement needed will not be so much that you have to adjust your lights.

if you're shooting a 3/4 portrait, try to make sure the smaller eye is closer to the camera or it can look unusual in the final photo.

that's it. good luck. and don't be obvious. (the same rule applies to breasts if shooting nude women, and the same trick can be applied. 90% of what body builders do is not for bulk, but trying for body symmetry.)

sorry for the long quick tip.

tl;dr: keep the lazy eye slightly closer to the camera. it will make the eyes look similar.",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,False,,,True,t3_nwe3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/nwe3x/a_quick_tip_to_anyone_learning_portraiture_that/,

I'm a photographer and camera salesman, and people ask me all the time about the basics of photography. You can search all over the internet for  tutorials on shutter speed, ISO and F stops, but they're usually dense and over-complicate things.

So, to help friends getting into photography, I made these info-graphics in MS paint, covering ISO, shutter speed, and F stop. My friends seemed to like them, and suggested I put them here so other people can learn from them! (I realize /r/photoclass exists, but since I'm new, I don't know if they have any cheat sheets like these. )


I hope these help you understand your camera better and take better photos!

EDIT: These tips are for total amateurs, probably people who just picked up their first DSLR with just a kit lens, and want to try out manual settings for shooting friends, basic landscapes, their kids, etc. The numbers proposed in my guides are approximate and not fit for professional use, but will do just fine for the standards of a beginner.

First thing you'll need is a sturdy tripod with a level. The closer you are to a leveled image, the less correction you'll have to do later.



Let's start with what's done on camera. This method uses 2 exposures. I generally shoot at -2/+2, but you may want to mess around with your exposures and see what works better for your particular scene. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to use a scene lit during the magic hour. 



I'll be turning [this](http://i.imgur.com/l6XWch.jpg) in to [this](http://i.imgur.com/0axehh.jpg).



Start off by opening both files in Camera Raw. On the under exposed image, adjust your fill light to bring out detail in all shadows. I almost always bump it up to 100%. Occasionally, I'll also adjust recovery a little. It all depends on whether or not the fill light blew out your highlights. Adjust temperature accordingly and tint accordingly. (A huge problem I have is florescent lighting exposing green.)



http://i.imgur.com/u3ocSh.jpg



Next, adjust the fill light on the over exposed image a bit. Normally I go about 40%. Again, adjust tint and temperature accordingly. 



http://i.imgur.com/yLR2uh.jpg



Open them up in Photoshop.


In the next step, you'll drag the over exposed image so that it's on top of the under exposed image. Add a white layer beneath the under exposed image.



http://i.imgur.com/LTxPQ.jpg



Here's where the magic happens. (Not really) On your over exposed layer, apply the multiply blending change. This should already give you a pretty decent look.



http://i.imgur.com/4x4hNh.jpg 



The next step is some local touch ups. Select your eraser tool and drop the opacity to somewhere between 5% and 10%. Now select your under exposed layer. Now you can slowly erase any shadows that are too dark, but try not to over do it. You just want to be able to see a little bit of detail in everything.



http://i.imgur.com/9zUUSh.jpg



Now flatten the image and duplicate the new layer.



http://i.imgur.com/Y2Tyf.jpg


Now you can transform the layer and use perspective and warp to make lens corrections. When using perspective, simply drag the bottom or top corner to the left or right to correct skewed lines. You can use warp to be a little more precise with it.


http://i.imgur.com/b6AeIh.jpg
(I've purposely stretched the walls a lot here to give an example.)


Next, you'll want to crop out whatever edges are overlapping.


http://i.imgur.com/N8DTI.jpg


Afterward, use selective color, color balance or local desaturation to finalize color correction. That method is up to you. I tend to use a variety of tools depending on what I'm going for. As you can see, my sensor was filthy when I shot this image so you'll want to spot any of that if it's showing. Then get rid of anything weird like that wire in the left hand of the image and you're set.


http://i.imgur.com/0axehh.jpg



I have actions setup that take care of most of the work for me. Once you play around with this, you'll probably want to do the same to really speed things up.



This is the first tutorial I've ever written so please feel free to ask any questions if something doesn't make sense and I will answer them as soon as I can. I really hope this method helps some of you out. I use it all the time and get very good results and have extremely happy clients.

I bring this up because both the Nikon D600 and Canon EOS 6D have been announced and all I read anywhere is how disappointing these cameras are and I feel like people need to get a bit of perspective. 

Okay so they're not earth shattering advancements in DSLR technology. You know what they are, they're Full Frame cameras with a MSRP of around $2k. When the 5DmkII was released the MSRP was $3400 and in two years it dropped $1000. Adjusted for inflation the original 5D would have been around $4k at release! 

More importantly than that they represent a new, or at least renewed (sorry A850) market segment that is perfect for a whole swathe of semi-pro or amateur photographers who want what FF can give them but don't want or need to fork out the big bucks for faster burst rates or clairvoyant autofocus. 

Undoubtedly these cameras will prove to be amazing (when was the last time Canikon actually made a bad DSLR?) and I think everyone needs to just take a minute and realise what they're complaining about.

Edit: Excellent discussion friends. I think we've seen some pretty good viewpoints from both sides of fence in this matter.

It looked abandoned, and I couldn't believe I hadn't seen it before, but there it was. Broken but beautiful. I thought about stopping and shooting it right then -- I happened to have a Nikon D5100 in the passenger seat -- but was tired from work and planned on coming back. 

I said this for a week or so each time I passed the house on the way home from work, until two days ago when I passed and the house and garage were gone. They must have demolished the buildings over the weekend, because there is quite literally nothing left but an extremely level patch of fresh dirt and a for sale sign next to the driveway. So I missed a great opportunity and won't get it back.

Over the same course of time I also noticed a two- to three-story high pile of dirt on my old high school's football field -- which is apparently being renovated -- and same story, planned to return to shoot it. But when I finally got out to do so the dirt had been spread and the shots weren't as dramatic as they could have been.

The moral of these stories is: If you see something worth shooting, don't wait, just shoot.

Basically, a couple of us who are new to digital photography had briefly discussed the notion of  reviving the /r/photoclass subreddit and working out our kinks together. It was suggested that we go ahead and start a new subreddit, possibly /r/photoclass2012 or something similar.

I'm making this post to see what kind of interest there might be from others out there who hadn't seen our earlier discussion and to sort of get a handle on getting it off the ground.

Also, I was hoping that maybe we could get a few of the more experienced photogs around here to chime in on occasion and critique us and provide some much needed input.

So... what're your thoughts on that?

Sorry if there's a better place to put this, but right here in /r/photography seemed like the most obvious place.

**EDIT: Yo Dawg! I heard you like edits..**(for formatting) EDIT:
SO... it appears that we've got a decent number of people interested in this. I went ahead and created **/r/photoclass2012a**  (the ""a"" is in there because of user eltictac's realization that others might want to begin the lessons later in the year).**


See you all soon! :)

1368300928.0,290,self.photography,1e569z,Why do DSLRs have an Auto mode? I've finally figured it out!,Mr_Will,496,206,286,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1e569z/why_do_dslrs_have_an_auto_mode_ive_finally/,"It's always puzzled me. We have Program, that I'll admit I've used from time to time, which is fully automatic with the potential for some basic adjustment but then we have the little green box as well - Automatic. What does it do? Exactly the same as program but without any adjustments at all. 

For a long time I thought this was just for idiots who'd bought an expensive camera with no intention of learning to use it but as my set up has become more complicated I've come to a realisation. Hand a camera set for back button focus, spot metering, manual selection of AF point and fixed ISO to someone else and the chances of getting a good shot are minimal, without first spending 5 minutes either explaining or resetting things at least.

Auto mode kills all this. Spin the wheel, hand the camera to anyone at all and it will function in the expected manner. Sure, the shots will not win any prizes and it might struggle in particularly funky conditions but 99% of the time the results will be passable and capture the moment. 

Case in point, my girlfriend took me out for a birthday dinner at a lovely rooftop restaurant here in London. We were all dressed up and had brought my camera along to take a few nice shots. A waiter spotted us messing with the camera and offer to take a couple of shots of us. I killed the most complicated settings, stuck it in program and handed it over. In my archives there is a beautiful shot of us. We are happy, smiling and looking our best, posed naturally in front of a beautiful city skyline. A beautiful city skyline that is perfectly in focus because the camera was on the centre autofocus point, which had passed clean between the two of us rendering us little more than a blur. 

Auto would have saved the day.",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,False,,,True,t3_1e569z,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1e569z/why_do_dslrs_have_an_auto_mode_ive_finally/,

As the title says I photographed my sister's wedding the weekend before last.  I told her that I wasn't a wedding photographer, that I'd never done a wedding (I haven't even been to one in probably 10 years) and that I thought we'd all be happier if she hired someone.  But she kept insisting, and their budget didn't really allow for a professional, so I finally agreed on the condition that she understood that the photos might suck.

This is what was supposed to happen.  I and a few other people would get to the park at 12:30 to set up, and then around 2:15 I would go to the hotel to meet the bridal party.  We were going to walk back to the park (taking pictures along the way) for the ceremony, which was supposed to last about 20 minutes.  Following that were the formals, the bridesmaids/groomsman photos, and then the reception stuff.  After the reception my sister and her husband and I were going to wander around downtown hanging out and taking pictures until it got dark.

Simple, right?

What actually happened is that it rained.  I was running errands and so I didn't get to the park until a little after 2, which was fine because we had already decided to move the reception to the house.  But that meant that I had to run to the hotel to meet them and I didn't get to scope out the park one last time.  Apparently due to the imminent rain someone decided to shorten the ceremony, and didn't tell me.  So instead of 20+ minutes I had less than 5 from the start of the procession to the kiss.  And then I had about another 5-6 minutes to shoot the formals because she was determined that they had to be taken at the park and it was starting to rain.  All told we were only at the park about 45 minutes with the ceremony and photos taking place in less that 15.

Then we went back to the house.  And we ate cake, drank lots of beer, danced, and had a pretty good time despite how badly things had gone.  

Oh, and top of all of that I was so sick that I don't even remember the rehearsal, and only parts of the wedding day.


Now that I've been through it I see why everyone recommend second shooting some before jumping on board the wedding photography train.


But in the end they're happy with the photos and everyone had a good time.  And I guess that's all that really matters.

Hey there /photography,
Last week there we had a fun and enjoyable [post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/ieech/having_trouble_tweaking_this_shot_could/), where we got to play around with a RAW file that was provided by user [ChoTai](http://www.reddit.com/user/ChoTai).

I love shooting RAW, doing post work on my photos in Lighroom (without relying too much on presets), and I'm always trying to learn new post techniques.

Would /photography be interested in a sub-reddit, similar to ITOOKAPICTURE or PICTURECHALLENGE, but where we can share processing tips and get to play around with RAW files?

I know that for some photography can be a very personal subject, and we might hate to see others edit or even 'butcher' our photos - but I think it could prove inspiring and refreshing to collaborate and see someone else's take on our work, or help others rescue a photo that they might otherwise discard...

What does /photography think? :)  
**EDIT:** Didn't realize someone had already asked this [same question](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/if7q3/would_you_be_interested_in_allowing_photo_editing/) a few days ago.

I'll go first.,charlesml3,306,43,246,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/udydf/post_your_workflow_ill_go_first/,"We all have our own method of doing this but I think it would be helpful to have a CONSTRUCTIVE discussion on various techniques.  I'd like for us to agree on a few groundrules for this thread so it doesn't just degrade into yet another flame war:

- Constructive criticism.  Provide useful feedback.  If you spot inefficiencies, please illustrate why it's inefficient and suggest a solution.
- No Canon vs. Nikon discussions.  Nobody needs to rehash that one again.
- No RAW vs. JPG discussions.  See the previous point.

OK.  Hopefully this will go well.  I use Lightroom and Photoshop.

Here's my workflow:

- Shoot in raw.  Exclusively.
- Import into Lightroom.  Attach keywords during import.
- First pass through:  Any blurry, poorly exposed, missed focus, flash didn't fire, unusable get the big ""X"" (reject).
- Second pass through: Looking for shots that are just bad.  Poor composition, eyes closed, photobombs, etc.  These get the ""X"" as well.
- Third pass through: Find groups of very similar shots.  Select them and use the ""N"" (Survey) to bring them up.  Find the worst shot and ""X"" it.  Repeat until you're down to 1 really good shot.  Hit the ""P"" (Pick).
- Repeat until you have your picks.  These should be the very best shots of the event and the only ones you'd consider showing anyone.
- Filter your view so you only see Flagged photos (your picks).
- Create a collection.  This should have a descriptive name like ""Belize 2012"" or ""Halloween 2011.""  
- Copy your picks here (LR doesn't actually COPY the files.  It's just pointers to the original RAW files which is awesome).
- I usually make one more pass through them looking for photos that just don't ""work"" for whatever reason.  Remove those from the collection.
- Add/update keywords as necessary.
- Basic edits: Crop, rotate, straighten, WB, Exposure, blah, blah, blah.
- If I need to use selections, right click and ""Edit in Photoshop.""

- Once all the edits are done I again make another pass through looking for shots I just don't like.  Again, narrowing the group down to the very best shots.  I find that for any given event, people really don't want to look at more than 35-40 shots.  Try to keep only the winners.

- Export as necessary.  Flickr, Picasa, whatever.  Full-size JPGs if I'm getting prints from Mpix.com.

No matter what I did and tested, it wouldn't turn on.  Canon quoted $400 to check the cam + labor parts.  Independent repair guy was around $250.  It was too much for me.  I decided to tackle the problem on my own.  I got the manual online.  Started taking the camera apart.  I got stuck on one thing. 
 
After that, I started asking around on a forum.  Somebody suggested I check the internal clock battery, I didn't even now it existed and its right next to the regular battery.  I went out and bought a new one.  Boom, camera fired right up.

So FYI if your cam is dead and doesn't turn on no matter what you do, check the internal clock battery.

The white thing on the right is a softbox with an Einstein E640 flash (it's blown out white because the modeling light was on).  Above is a round reflector, though to be honest I don't think it was doing much. 

The water receptacle is my wife's favorite martini glass filled to the brim with just regular tap water.

To the right of the glass is a Canon 580EX flash sitting on a PocketWizard remote transceiver ~~(though for this particular shot it was off)~~.  EDIT: Looking again, I think it might have been on for this shot with a pink gel.

Camera (Canon 7D with Canon 100mm f/2.8L IS macro lens) was triggered with a wired hand-held trigger (TC-80N3). Food coloring or other liquid was dropped by hand and timed manually by watching the drop and trying to time hitting the trigger for the moment of impact.

For this shot, I already been doing some food coloring splash shots, so the water had various colors swirling around in it.  I used some drops of milk to get this and what you see is the end of the splash where there's an ejection of liquid from the splash shot.  The drops look colorful because they've already gone into the colorful water and mixed a bit before being ejected.  The surface looks kind of grey and glassy because the angle I had the camera at relative to to the surface of the water.

I didn't do much post-processing except for a crop, some increase in contrast, and a de-saturation of color along the back edge of the glass (the whole surface was already de-saturated).

I work at a studio, I guess she looked us up. Her deal was, she's a portrait photographer normally but she did this one commercial gig for a business that wanted to run an ad in several papers. And her question was, well I'm about to go into this meeting, I've never charged for this before, what do I charge so I look like I know what I'm doing..

I explained - having sold more than a few commercial pics in my day, but nothing huge - price what you think you're worth. Like if it were me, I'd ignore the # of papers they were advertising in and just sell the copyright to them for commercial use at $1500. When I hung up the phone, I thought.. man, I hope I didn't screw her. $250-$500 seemed more reasonable.

Well, I got a call back about an hour later - she sold 3 photos for $1500 each, grand total $4500 for THREE files. Holy fucking shit.

So yeah, this is just your daily reminder to not be afraid to ask what you think you're worth. It might pay off. Worst case scenario is they balk and you need to negotiate.

I run a small photography class on the basics of photography - would there be any interest in me uploading the 8 week course in blog format? I cover the basics of digital cameras, exposure control, editing, creative techniques, etc...

It'll be a little work on my end to get it up but if there's interest here I'll begin the process of digitizing my notes. I could even pop up some assignments should there be anyone keen on honing their control and skills and I'll do my best to review and critique in /r/photocritique.

The 8 week course is usually a few hundred dollars to attend, but I'm sure I'll never be able to meet you all anyway, so I'm happy to pass all I know along. Let me know below if you'd like me to start!


***Update***
Wow, thanks for the feedback on the idea everyone! I'm getting started on the work, please give me a couple of weeks to get it ready! I'll post class-by-class each week, giving myself a couple of weeks head start so I can afford to miss one, I'm a working photographer so sometimes things can get a little hectic when there's work around.

I'll announce it in /r/photography and cross post around a little to some of the suggestions given below. Be aware I'll make a new reddit account for it as well, just to keep things neat and tidy.

Then when she strips naked, at every location, I get a photo of her nude and smiling, holding her drivers license, and also the photo release. This shows that the photo release is signed by her, that she has a valid ID and is of age, and that she is clearly consenting to nude photography.

If you ever take any kind of photos in a public setting such as a park, or a landscape scene that could be seen as voyeuristic, this protects you from her saying that you were stalking her or taking photos with her unaware.
When I get home the photo release is filed away and I keep the digital copy of the release with the photos.

It is of crucial importance to always have a photo release. If the worst case happens, and the girl dies, the rights to her photos revert to her family. If you don't have a release, they can sue you over those photos.

All of this might sound kind of odd to the girl, but explain the legality of it, and don't do the shoot without it. If she's not willing to do something small to protect you, it's not worth taking the photos at all. This way she can't say that she consented to non nude photos, but then you got creepy and made her take off her clothes or something.",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,False,,,True,t3_k0tku,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/k0tku/neat_tip_for_legally_protecting_yourself_when/,

1367911717.0,243,self.photography,1dume4,"How do I suggest to a bride that she might want to ""clean-up"" a bit for her wedding day?",,310,67,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1dume4/how_do_i_suggest_to_a_bride_that_she_might_want/,"SO, I am all about self-expression in my photos, I am the absolute last person to blur-tool my client's face into an unrecognizable doll-mask, or painstakingly hide every stray hair in a wedding shoot. 

**HOWEVER**... I had a bride approach me about a week ago, who decided to work with me. GREAT! She wants her photos to be 'timeless, quality' photos of her and her husband on the day of the wedding, and has finally found a photographer to to do it. EVEN BETTER! She has stressed several times that she wants everything to be ""just perfect"", TOTALLY DO-ABLE. 

But in her first email to me, and every correspondence since, she has made a comment about her looks, a la:

*I'm historically un-photogenic*

*you can figure out lighting to get rid of my dark-circles and crow's feet right?*

*I have awful rosacea* (3 or 4 times now)

*I'm just so darn plain looking*

*hopefully you can photoshop out all my gray hairs LOL*


So in an email responding to one of her questions on local caterers, I happened to mention that I knew quite a few local professional Make-up artists and Hair-dressers too who were looking to expand their client base and offered great rates. Her response was far from what I was expecting, she said ""I never wear make-up!! why would I?? I'm planning on just throwing up my hair in a ponytail for the ceremony""


first off, before you tear into me, yes I truly believe a person is most beautiful in their fresh face. *however*, this is a formal event, in an outdoor setting, that is going to be memorialized on your walls, in frames, and on facebook **forever**. And as we photographers know, sometimes uncontrolled natural light can be a little unkind. 

SO, do I maybe try to suggest to her sister-in-law-to-be (who is a close friend of mine) to talk her into um ""polishing up"" a bit? Or do I just pony up to another few extra hours of photoshop? I'm kind of lost here! 

**TL:DR** version: My bride complains about her looks every time we speak, but balks at the idea of even a little cover-up to bring out her natural beauty. She plans on ""just throwing her hair up"" for the ceremony! How do I politely approach the subject that this is kind of a once in a lifetime event, that is going to be documented forever??

Thanks for your advice guys!!

I was walking to the train station from college when I got pulled up by someone demanding to see the photos on my camera. The camera was over my shoulder, lens cap on but somehow he got this idea that I had taken photos of him in the 10 seconds I was walking towards him.

After explaining to him that I wasn't even shooting anything and that cameras didn't have LCD's in the 60's (I happened to be rolling with my Nikon F) and I wouldn't be able to show him the photos even if I wanted to. This sent him over the edge for some reason. He raised his voice and started demanding to see the folio I had under my arm. I told him that was none of his concern and tried to walk to my train. He let me go, but he followed me all the way to the station abusing me about nothing in particular. 

Looking back on it now, it's sort of funny but I was genuinely concerned for my safety while it was happening. Does this happen often? I don't shoot street often, I absolutely love it but this has definitely deterred me a little.

I've seen a lot of really great stuff, and received a lot of really helpful advice. It seems to me though that downvotes and unhelpful criticism are becoming more and more of a trend here. Today for example, at least half the posts made have twice as many downvotes as upvotes, and in many cases no upvotes at all. This is for no obvious reason, the person is asking an honest question about their hobby. I suppose the point that I am trying to get at  (and the point many of you seem to ignore) is that just because you know the answer, or because it's obvious to you, doesn't mean it's a bad or invalid question. This subreddit gets maybe 40 posts a day, so it's not like there is a flood of stuff coming in that is too much to handle. I guess I'm just frustrated with the direction this seems to be going, and the fact that people aren't getting they help they deserve (or seemed to be getting 3 months ago). Oh, and don't forget to upvote the good stuff. I've seen a few posts with lots of people commenting and answering, but it had no upvotes from people so the downvotes were the only things being considered. This has nothing to do with karma, it's about making sure things don't get buried and people don't get discouraged from asking questions like I have. Those of you who are awesome keep being awesome, and those of you who aren't at least leave a constructive comment below before you downvote.

[Screenshot for the skeptics.](http://i.imgur.com/eghHs.png) I can count about 6 posts in that small window that have been downvoted to no recovery, about 4 of them for no good reason, the other two for arbitrary reasons.

TL;DR I'm ranting about people downvoting for no reason, and wondering why it happens.

* Edit: Bring on the downvotes, I'm braced.

* Edit: Overall I'm actually pleasantly surprised by the response this has gotten. I feel like a lot of issues have been hashed out and maybe something will happen because of this (wishful thinking probably) I feel like this can be debated back and forth for eternity about the pros and cons of everything, but nothing is going to change unless the mods take some drastic action. Maybe some new rules, a downvote text that is a little shorter but just as clear, disabling downvotes, creating new subreddits or a combination of these.

* Edit: Clong12 Suggested this, and I think it is a great idea. [He started a trial here](http://redd.it/q9yp2)
&gt;why don't the Mods set up some kind of Weekly Stupid Question thread? It won't fix everything, but it may help.

It's amazing how much more control I have now over my images, how much richer the final result is. I'm just pissed because there are a lot of photos I've taken over the past few years that could have been so much better, especially things I've done in low light or where I've had blown highlights.

So if you're procrastinating, stop! Take a little time and get comfortable with using your RAW software.

Everyone started somewhere and we all had to learn the basics. Share a story from when you started learning that now makes you feel silly. None of us has stopped learning yet (that's one of the reasons we are on this sub) so hopefully this will help put the starters minds at ease.

My short story.. I had just got my first DSLR (600D with 18-55 and 55-250) the week before and spent tons of time on the net working out how exposure worked. Took me a good couple of days just to get the basic concept of stops and their 3 controls (Aperture, shutter speed and ISO). I knew how to get right up close to a flower and change to manual focus to take a macro shot. I'm pretty good at this! Great, time to go out and take pictures of trees! My wife and I went to the natural bridge a few hours out of Brisbane, Australia. When we were there I saw a lady and her kids taking a picture of a dinosaur sculpture about 500 meters away with a P&amp;S. I currently had my daddy sized lens on (55-250) and the lady said to her kids, ""he'd be able to get a better picture of it!"" To which I replied, ""Nah, this only has manual focus"". I took the picture and we both chimped it to see that the dinosaur was still ages away. I learned a week or so later that my zoom lenses could zoom and why they gave a range of focal lengths. Felt pretty embarrassed once I realised I could just have zoomed right in, the lady would have been pretty confused that I didn't know that.

Your turn!

TLDR: Didn't realise my 55-250 could change focal length when asked to take a pic by a stranger of something far away. Now share your embarrassing story.",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,False,,,True,t3_1e3ra5,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/1e3ra5/confessions_from_when_you_were_super_nooby/,

There's nothing wrong with that, but I'm usually not interested in any of that. Rather, I'm more interested in looking at fine art photography.

I know the term ""fine art"" can come off as snobby or vague to a lot of people, but the way I regard whether a work is fine art is if it has a conceptual significance and (at least some) intellectual planning involved. Basically, why did you take that photo, and why does it belong as part of the series? ""Because it was beautiful"" and ""the colors matched"" shouldn't be the only answers.

I'm thinking the new subreddit can be either a self-post of a series that you're working on (asking for a critique, etc.) or links to others' works that are online (perhaps from fine art photography blogs like [Conscientious](http://www.jmcolberg.com/weblog/) and [FlakPhoto](http://flakphoto.com)). I'm also thinking that this will revolve more around more contemporary and newer work.

Thoughts?

**EDIT 1:** Seems like there are a good number of you who would be interested in this! I'm gonna go ahead and make this soon. PM me if you'd like to be a mod! /u/sweotol, /u/endsmeetandgreet, and /u/LiamHard, you all expressed interested in helping out, do you guys wanna be mods? Otherwise, stay tuned and look for some good fine art work!

**EDIT 2:** I've gotten a handful of interest from you guys to be mods for the new subreddit. We're at five right now (based on first come, first serve). We've decided to cap it at that number for now, to keep it sane and simple. Once we start building more traffic and subscribers then we'll possibly bring on more mods to help us out. Otherwise, we're busy planning to make this an awesome subreddit, so make sure you head on over to /r/FineArtPhoto and just subscribe for now (don't make any new posts yet).

1346124627.0,227,self.photography,yxy7o,"I may have bitten off more than I could chew, and now I need some advice.",meadhawg,276,49,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/yxy7o/i_may_have_bitten_off_more_than_i_could_chew_and/,"I shot a wake boarding competition this weekend, mainly for my own fun and skill development, but with an eye towards possibly making some contacts for the future and maybe selling a picture or two.  I got a much better response than I expected though.  I probably handed out 75-100 business cards with my Flickr address on them, and fielded probably 40-50 requests for where to purchase prints of the pictures I was taking.  Apparently, there is a dearth of photographers at these events and they were so pleased to see someone with professional looking equipment that I was virtually attacked with requests.  

It was pretty neat though when people would approach me and tell me their child or spouse was coming up.  They would let me know when a big trick was coming up, or specific things to try and capture.  In one weekend, I learned a good bit abut their sport, and a ton about sports and event photography.

I now have two problems regarding the photos from this weekend.  First of all, I took over 5500 photos over the two days, how the hell do I sort through all of them?  Obviously, I can sort out the bad pictures on a quick and dirty first pass (and I have), but now that I am down to about 3500 remaining ""decent"" pictures, how do I narrow down what I post for people to look at and potentially purchase?  Some are still not technically great photographs, but they do still show the trick really well or have a good facial expression, etc. despite technical problems.  Are those generally considered acceptable, or should I keep only the absolute best pictures and exclude a lot of the participants and some of the best tricks because the picture didn't have the technical merits it should have?  I kind of feel that I need to include as many different people as possible since I am hoping as many people as possible will purchase them.

Which brings me to my second problem.  What service should I use to host and print the pictures?  I am aware of Shutterfly and Smugmug, but I don't really know the ins and outs of this yet.  I had really thought that at most a few people would look at my Flickr page and e-mail me that they wanted a copy of a picture that I could run and have printed.  The response I got while at the event leads me to believe that this won't be sufficient, I just don't have the time to spend with a printer to print as many requests as I had.  What service would be best to use, how much do the sites actually cost, how much of a percentage of each sale do the sites keep, and how much should I charge for pictures?

One additional question that I have; I was also asked about personal shoots.  A couple of families approached me and said they would be interested in having me come out on their boats with them for a few hours to shoot their people individually.  They had mentioned getting several of them together to spread the cost around, so I take that to mean they are expecting to spend a pretty good chunk of money in this.  I have never done any contract shooting before, so I have absolutely NO idea how much to charge, what kind of contract to have them sign, whether to offer pictures as part of a package or let them choose individually, whether to print these personally or just post them on a hosting site and let them order prints, etc.  I don't think it deserves near the money that a wedding or major event would, but I don't really know for sure.  I am completely new to shooting for others, and apparently stumbled into a niche that I never knew existed.  Please give me any and all advice that you can or are willing to, I could use some serious help here.

Please upvote for visibility,vwllss,312,85,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/o41f9/rphotography_are_we_happy_with_our_flair_system/,"As you may have noticed, we have a fairly focused flair system.  Any user may choose to designate themselves as beginner or enthusiast, and some may be designated expert or professional.

We mods have been talking, and I suggested maybe throwing it out and allowing any photo related flair (Portraiteer, f/8'er, Teleshooter, etc).  Maxion said it would be best just to ask you guys, and of course I agree.

As I see it, there are three options we can take and each has pros/cons:

### Our current flair w/ mod approval for expert/professional

Pros:

* Functional for furthering discussion and getting well-known users visible.  For example, av4rice and MercurialMadnessMan always make good comments and it can alert newbies to listen to them.
* Impervious to trolls/offensive flairs
* Doesn't mention gear, so no arguments about that

Cons:

* Not very personal; no 'cute' tags
* Some view 'professional' tags as elitist

### Let anybody set anything photo related

Pros:

* Very personal, you guys can have fun with being cheeky.
* We keep it photo related so hopefully it says at least *something* about you as a photographer.

Cons:

* Could *easily* dissolve into chaos, kind of like when subreddits allow memes. 
* Possibility for lots of dumb and/or offensive flairs which means added work for us mods.  If we do this, please use the report feature and/or send a modmail about anything you see.

### Let people apply for any kind of flair

Pros:

* Easier to moderate and prevent chaos because your 'applications' would be in a nice little list.
* Impervious to trolls/offensive flairs
* Still retains some personality

Cons:

* People might cry censorship if we disallow something
* You won't be able to switch your flairs around frequently

There are a lot of great points made in it and the discussion below.  But, lets take a look at the other side.

A few years ago my wife went to the zoo with our niece.  She had the Canon Digital Rebel XTi (EOS 400D) and a 18-55mm kit lens with her.  This was a very popular camera at the time (it was the number one most used camera on Flickr for several years) and so a few other zoo patrons also had the same camera. People were taking pictures of their kids and the animals.  There were  a couple of guys there with higher end gear, big white lenses and hoods and external flashes and visibly larger camera bodies.  They were being very loud making fun of my wife and the other people.  ""How cute, all of these people are shooting with Rebels.""  The snide comments went on for a while.

Yeah, that teenager that ribs you because they don't know any better is a punk, but just because you have better equipment it doesn't mean you have a free pass to be rude.

Am I being screwed?",noobprodigy,279,61,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/109w56/after_paying_a_photographer_1800_to_photograph_a/,"I organized a music festival this summer. I got in touch with a photographer who had done an event for one of my associates last year. I loved his work, and I wanted to secure him and his partner to handle the photo and video for the event. I was quoted at $1800 to photo/video the 15 hour event. This was a nonprofit event, being funded by sponsorships. I thought it was very important to document the event with professional photos and video, so we worked it into the budget.

The photos have been processed, and after going through 11000 photos, there is an official album of about 340 photos. They are great photos. They have been posted to their website, where people can buy the digital download for $2 per photo. They posted the album online with a full photo watermark. When asked about obtaining the photos from performers at the festival, they have referred them to the pay site.

I had assumed that I would be given the digital files once the album was complete. This was the first event of this scale that I have organized, so I didn't know how they would do it, but I know that for the smaller event they did for my friend, they included the digital files in the price.

So I had a meeting with them today to discuss this. This came up because they were contacted by one of the performers who has a clause in their contract granting all rights to photos and videos taken of them. In our meeting today, they informed me that the $1800 I paid was just for their time to take and process the photos. If I wanted the files, I would have to pay extra.

I should have gotten something in writing beforehand, because I would have told them that I wanted all the photos, and to include it in the price. They forgot to tell me beforehand that's how they were planning on doing it. I truly believe it was an honest mistake on the photographer's part. He is a nice guy and I don't think he is actively trying to screw me. However, I feel that I was told it would be $1800, and it was reasonable for me to expect that it included the files because of the prior work he had done for my friend.

I am conflicted because while I feel that it is unfair for me to have to pay more for the files, I also don't want them to lose income if the way they make their profit is on the website downloads, and that they quoted me a price based on them counting on the back end income from the file downloads.

They are coming up with a substantial discount for me to purchase the entire album because of the misunderstanding, which is their own fault.

Is this a normal business practice for event photographers of concerts, etc.? Should I try to demand the files for free? Should I just screen cap their site and get all the photos that way? Should I just pay it and never use them again? One thing is certain, I will always be getting something in writing beforehand from now on.

**UPDATE: The photographer just messaged me on facebook to offer to provide me with the entire album for $100. He will keep them for download on his site, and I will only provide them to people who contacted me directly for their photos, like performers, etc. In the end, we both learned a lesson, and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future. I will also have nothing bad to say about him as he worked with me to resolve the matter in a mutually beneficial manner.**

Last night I wrapped up development and published to Google Play the Android version of my ""fancy"" depth of field tool called ""Lens•Lab.""

It's different from every other depth of field tool that I've ever seen in that it works much more fluidly and nicely and helps the user get an intuitive understanding of how depth of field works.

The iOS version has been around for almost two years (it's my most popular app) but I just now finished the Android version.

I'm going to put it up for free for a few days. You'll have to enable installing apps from an untrusted source on your device. It will run on any Android device (phones, tablets, etc.) running Android OS 2.2 or newer.

Here's the direct link to the .apk:

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3903183/LensLab1.0.1.apk

Here's the link to the Google Play in case you can't or don't want to side load or if you think it's cool enough to spend $1.99:

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeffmenter.lenslab

Also, here's a link to the iOS version (also $1.99):

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lens-lab/id431559363?mt=8

The idea for this app was hatched when I was trying to explain how depth of field works to a friend of mine who was just getting into photography. I thought that if there was a way to show depth of field information visually and dynamically (rather than as a bunch of numbers) then it would be much easier to learn. I think that is the case.

So, do you want to try it? Do you have any feedback? Did you find a bug?

I think it's a neat tool and I hope it helps both beginners and seasoned professionals.

EDIT: Fixed it so it should work much better with smaller screen sizes (like 320x240) and should also work better with lower density tablets. Dropbox link to APK has been updated. 1.0.1 is the new version.

EDIT 2: thanks to everyone for the feedback, it really helps a lot!

A few notes: It should become apparent that I'm no writer, please be gentle on spelling and grammar reddit! I'll admit most classes are a long read - they're online versions of a 2 hour class so I've taken to breaking the classes down into bite size segments. Read a segment, take a break, look at Ridiculously Photogenic Guy for a few minutes and keep going.


I'll be posting week 2 next week - I'm still chipping away at it. The process involves me converting my (extensive) short form talking points into readable long form and is taking me forever between work and some semblance of a social life. On top of that, I'm creating most of the graphics, test shots and other media myself to be able to provide this class for free.  There's a donate button down there that would definitely help cover some of the time if you're feeling generous :). It goes directly into purchasing ever stronger coffee to fuel my habit and keep me writing.

I got paid $500!

Okay, so not that exciting.  After a couple more emails back and forth, they agreed to pay me via PayPal, and sent me a word doc with a [consent form](http://i.imgur.com/onCIS.jpg) to sign, scan, and send back.  I did so, and got the money the next morning.  Yay.

The terms of the agreement are actually a lot better than I was expecting, especially after they used the phrase 'total buyout' earlier.  No rights lost on my part, except that they can do whatever they want with the picture and I don't get to complain anymore.  Especially so, since technically the form is just a model release.  (Hopefully they don't mind that I filled in my own information, rather than the moth's.  :)

It's funny- most people I asked (reddit and real life) were split evenly between telling me I should ask for $500 and $5000.  I really don't think I got ripped off, but I still wonder how much more I *could* have got.  I guess I'll never know.  If this ever happens again, I'll aim a little higher.

**Please post an album, then look through at least two other people's albums.**

You don't need to give a detailed critique, although that would be nice. Just a simple ""I like this photo the best"" and a link to your favourite photo, is good enough. This is just to get a little bit of feedback and an unprofessional opinion on which of your photos people like.

**Please don't forget to upvote this and the other weekly threads to keep them on the frontpage longer. This will reduce the amount of spam and loose threads in /r/photography** I receive no upvotes for this text/self post, but you will receive upvotes from me if you critique someone else's work!

Please try to post ""Albums"" not ""Here are 200 photos from my trip to Japan"" or ""Here is my flickr photo-stream"". (This is a guideline - You can still share hundreds of photos if you want, but it would be better for you and your viewers if you put together small, concise albums)

And please pay the courtesy of commenting someone else's photos if you wish to be commented. I know comment-for-comment is not the best way to get feedback, but if everyone just posts, and nobody comments, we just end up with a bunch of orphaned albums.

As little as ""this is my favourite photography [link]"" is enough.

We decided to meetup at a Starbucks and that I would bring my latptop to look at a couple test shots to look at. 

So I get there and he hands me the lens with a Hoya skylight filter on it. And he says he'll just leave the filter on until we finish up the deal(he's trying to sell the filter with the lens like it's a special package). I take a look at the rear element which is nice, and then I take a look at the front element and see scratching on the lens through the filter. I took the filter off to take a closer look and told him straight up that I couldn't buy it.

He's trying to tell me that he never noticed and that he had the filter on since he bought it new. Yeah right guy. The reason he had the filter on was so that it would hamper my ability(or an unsuspecting buyer) to see the front element properly. 

Moral of the story: do a THOROUGH inspection of any photographic equipment you buy.

1330537485.0,213,self.photography,qbkeb,Great news everyone! We've (potentially) solved a problem!,aeonblack,304,91,176,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/qbkeb/great_news_everyone_weve_potentially_solved_a/,"I'm going to try and be brief with this so you all actually read it. For a long time we've been struggling to figure out a way to deal with two large ""problems"" this sub has: people asking basic questions and the photo only rule. This is how we are going to address both of them.

Every week one of the moderators will make two new threads and distinguish them. I encourage you all to upvote them as well as to post to them. 

* One of the threads will be a place for people to ask their simple/basic/stupid/silly/dumb/whatever questions. This is not going to be a place where people get flamed, just a place to get answers to questions. It doesn't matter if you've been shooting one week or 40 years, everyone gets questions from time to time. Be it about gear, techniques, etc, it will all be welcome in the question thread. Will all the noobs post there? Probably not, but if this thread exists, we can delete the simple question posts and direct the posters to this single thread. This will sort of consolidate one problem and make it much easier for those of you who hate those posts to avoid, and those of you who like to help to, well, help.

* The other thread will be a place for all of you to post your own pictures, possibly to post what has inspired you, etc. I am still a bit unclear as to what we want to allow and not allow in this thread, but those are specifics that we will let you all decide on. I don't want anyone to feel like ""oh, if I post to that thread I'm just going to get my shit criticized until I don't want to shoot anymore"", I am fully encouraging amateurs, pros, casuals, enthusiasts and everyone in between to post here. Will people criticize you? Probably, we have a handful of members with a serious chip on their shoulder. But, don't let that stop you from posting! We are all here because we love photography!


So, the plan right now is to let this thread get some visibility for a few days and then we will post up the threads on, say, Friday. We would let the first one run from friday (mar. 2) until the following saturday (mar. 10). After that, we will most likely keep it a sunday-saturday thing. Every week we will make a new set of threads stating the date that thread is running/active. 

Here is where we want your help. What would you like the titles of the threads to be? Do you want them to stay the same or change every week? A couple examples I came up with are ""Shameless Self Promotion: Feb. 26-Mar. 04"" and ""Simple Questions, Overly Complex Answers: Feb. 26-Mar. 04"". These are just examples so you get an idea of what the titles would look like.

Any further ideas for the threads? Any issues you have with them? Comments? Suggestions? Question marks? 

**Edit: To be clear, the photo only rule will still exist as it does now (posts containing only photos with no questions/comments will be deleted), but this thread will be an exception to the rule. It will be the one place in /r/photography where you can just post a picture you took.**",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,True,,ent,True,t3_qbkeb,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/qbkeb/great_news_everyone_weve_potentially_solved_a/,moderator

1348439618.0,212,self.photography,10d1lb,Canon EOS - all about MF lenses we can get,Mendewesz,268,56,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/10d1lb/canon_eos_all_about_mf_lenses_we_can_get/,"Please do not downvote this if you are not interested or Nikon user.  

DSLRs from Canon got one very big advantage - register distance -- you can mount almost everything on them. Actually, there are only few brands with longer RD that you can't use with Canon or have to use some shitty adapter with glass. There are many sources about manual lensest but I've never found any comprehensive list of the best glass available for Canon users in every mount available.  

I hope this will catch on and we can create really great list of manual lenses.

**Please add in comments everything I missed, this is just the beginning, let's make this the best list of old lenses available on the Internet**   

NOTE: This is not a list of all lenses ever, post only the best ones/worth attention/unique.  

If there's demand we can expand it for mirrorless system which have even shorter RD and can get more lenses, what do you think? And I can post it on mflenses.com to expand it even more.  

Technical info:  

You can get adapters with focus confirmation, which are more expensive but you get nice little beep when focus is right.  

Using these lenses on APSC without focusing screen and/or LiveWiev will be almost impossible even with focus confirmation. It's much easier on FF although if you are 5D user be careful for your mirror! Some lenses are not compatible. I wonder how it will look on 6D.  

When you buy an adapter, make sure you get one with a matte or felt-lined interior, as you can get some glare using lenses with larger rear element.  

Usually these lenses are really good for video work because of very long and smooth focus rings. 

**M42 (Pentax Screwmount): 45.46mm**  

Info: 
Most popular mount right now, some lenses are highly overpriced, really good in 50-135mm range. Can't really recommend anything wider than 35mm.  You can even use darkroom enlargers for some super-macro.

Best lenses:  

Almost any 50mm will be pretty good if you will get a nice copy, some of them are exceptionally good even now.  

**Takumar** - everything from them will be great. Next to Zeiss, highest prices on the market, 50 1.4 is considered as the best 50mm on M42 and one of the best 50mm ever made.  SMC versions are the best - newest and much better coating, although Super version are still worth looking into.  
SMC 24 2.8  
SMC 35 3.5  
SMC 50 4 Macro  
SMC 50 1.4  
SMC 50 1.8  
SMC 55 1.8  
SMC 55 2  
SMC 85 1.8  
SMC 100 4 Macro  
SMC 135 2.5  

**Fujinon** - almost as good as Takumars.  
EBC 50 1.4
EBC 50 1.8    

**Carl Zeiss Jena** - expensive, well build, amazing quality.  Comes with different markings and colors, the best are with ""MC"" in the name for multi coating. Can't go wrong with them.  
Carl Zeiss Jena Flektogon 35 2.8  
Carl Zeiss Jena Pancolar 50 1.8  
Carl Zeiss Jena Biotar 58 2  
Carl Zeiss Jena Sonnar 135 3.5  

**Yashica** - available on C/Y and M42, great lenses, similiar in build and IQ to Zeiss Jena.  
Yashinon 50 1.7 ML  

**Porst** - German rebrand of some popular lenses.  
55 1.2 (!!!)   

**Helios** - cheap copies of some Zeiss' models, weird, swirly bokeh.  
44-4, 44-7 etc. - 58 2.8 - copy of Zeiss Biotar, really interesting lens, known for bokeh.  
**40-2** - 85 1.5 - portrait beast, sick prices on ebay, production of this lens started again few weeks ago, new version is sold two times cheaper than the ebay 30 years old version...  

**Jupiter** - old russian lenses, considered as pretty good, especially the longer ones.  
Jupiter 37A 135 3.5  
Jupiter 21M 200 4  

**Tair** - ??  
Tair 11A 135 2.8 - bokeh  

**Mir** - good old Russia.  
Mir-1V 37 2.8 

**Telezenitar** - ??  
Telezenitar APO 135 - considered as the best 135mm available on M42.  

**Pentax K: 45.46mm**  

Info: Same lenses as for M42 only different adapter is needed.  In M42 mount thet are called SMC Takumar so it's basically the best you can get.  

Best lenses:  
Same as M42, named as ""Pentax"" instead of ""Takumar"".

**Contax/Yashica (CY): 45.5mm**  
Info: Not as popular as M42 which is good for prices. Zeiss made some amazing glass for Contax, better than the M42 versions, marked as T *, contuinued until now on modern mounts.  
Best lenses:  
Yashica 50 1.7 ML  
Zeiss Planar 1.4 T *  
Zeiss Distagon 35 1.4 T *  
Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* 35-70 3.4  
I could basically list all of them.  

**Olympus OM: 46mm**  
Info: Highly underrated manual lenses, the Zuiko series is considered to be very, very good. Some of them are still expensive.  
Best lenses:  
Zuiko 50 1.4  
Zuiko 50 1.8  
Zuiko 28 2.8  
Zuiko 100 2.8  
Zuiko 200 4  

**Nikon F: 46.5mm**  
Info:  
Manual glass from Nikon is considered as great, prices are high. Can mount on new Nikon DSLRs. 

Best lenses:  
105 2.5 AI-S, AI, any pre-AI  

**Leica R (SLR): 47mm**   
Info:
Expensive! Not really sure if worth investing.

Best lenses:
50 2
Macro Elmarit-R 60 2.8

**Mamiya 645: 63.3mm**  
Info:
Medium format, ???

Best lenses:
???  

**Hasselblad V-Monut: ??mm**  

Info: Medium format, xpensive, heavy and big, IQ??  

Best lenses:  
Hasselblad Makro-Planar 120/4 CF T*  
??  

**Samyang lenses**  

Info: New brand of Korean lenses, exceptional quality, incredibly low price. Actually much better than almost any stuff I mentioned here, although more expensive.  

Best lenses:  
8 2.8 fisheye  
14 2.8 IF ED UMC Aspherical    
85 1.4 IF MC Aspherical  - often compared to Canon 85 1.2L
35 1.4  - often compared to Canon 35 1.4L

**Voigtlander lenses**  
Info: Really good pancake, wide angle and pretty interesting macro-portrait lens. Good build quality, high prices.  

Best lenses:      
20 3.5 Color-Skopar  
40 2 Pancake  
90 3.5 Macro  

**Carl Zeiss ZE lenses**  

Info: Very expensive, all about quality, 50 1.4 is actually considered as not as good as the rest.  

Best lenses:  
50 2 Macro-planar - pretty much the best 50mm you can get
Basically any other lens

I have not been linked or credited in any way. I'm disappointed because in the past I've been asked by more than a few people if they can use one, or more, of my zombie images and I've had no problem with it. All were just peeps trying to get some traffic. For a broadcaster's blog to do this? Evil. Since I posted this image two years ago I've seen it stolen by a pile of people too.

I expect that would be ignored and/or they'll just take the image down. Fine. No, no it's not fine at all! It's too easy to just take an image and ask forgiveness.

I've tried everything from strobe with bounce flash or diffuser, over LED and incandescent torches, gasoline camping stoves, candles, and carbide lamps (the latter two give a really warm, yellow light, and carbide lamps last forever, which is why so many cavers and tunnel types here like them - even though they take a while to prepare).

I've gotten best results with layers in photoshop, and taught myself a bit of layer blending and masking (as well as getting rid of the occasional light squiggle - always turn off your damn headlamp while moving).  My camera has an obnoxious long-exposure bug that causes a green bar along the bottom of the sensor at exposures over ~30-45 seconds, and I can't send it in yet as my replacement camera hasn't arrived, so I'm limited to shorter exposures.  Most of my nicer results come with around 10 pics.

The gel flashes (&lt; $10 for a set from Strobist on ebay) are fun, if a bit gimmicky.  I also get cool effects by mixing shots with different white balances and types of light.  One thing I learned is that less is more, especially with powerful torches and exposure times.  Settings are usually around f/8, iso 160, no IS (big heavy tripod) and a radio remote (simple Accessory Power, about $30 on Amazon, can't recommend it enough - oh right, no gear talk.)

The dust in these places is a problem, so I always use a UV filter, carry a fine brush and keep the lens cap on when I'm not shooting.  Also, black electrical tape is a lifesaver, put it over your viewfinder to avoid light leak.

Composition - meh.  I'm terrible at it although I get lucky occasionally.  When you're in complete darkness, tired as hell from a 40m rope descent, out in the middle of the night, and generally in an ""OMG OMG OMG"" mood because of where you've ended up, aesthetics take second place :D

Here are some examples:

Most of them sit on a high shelf and collect dust.  The 12 foot long shelf was a bit overloaded and needed reinforcement and to be raked back a bit.  So while I had everything down I dusted them off, arranged them (along with some of my active digital cameras) and took a group shot.  Top center is a 1917  3.25"" x 5.5"" Graflex that I converted to 4"" X 5"" in my college days.  Note the Yashica-A twin reflex, Several Kodak Brownies, A Nikon F3, A digital Sony Mavica that recorded onto floppy disks, A Canon G1, A Nikon 8400 with a fisheye lens, a Beaulieu 8mm movie camera and my Nikon lenses.  Not pictured are a WWII 8mm gun camera, D200 (that took the photo), S4100 (POS) and maybe 10 more cameras on a shelf at work.

Everything went better than expected. ,TheBiles,261,53,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/10saq8/update_funeral_shoot_everything_went_better_than/,"Basic summary of the event:  The event was held in a chapel with fairly good light. I showed up about 20 minutes early and wore a plain black suit with a black tie.  I initially only brought in my 5D3 with 24-70, and after a few minutes of getting to know the settings and seeing how things were going I got to talk to the departed's son, who was actually very glad that the hometown newspaper sent someone.  The son even found me again after about 10 minutes and specifically let me know who the VIPs were who showed up (the departed was a State's Attorney who was very loved in his home state).  When it was time for the ceremony to start, I actually went and got my 70-200 because it was such a large chapel, so I could easily sit in the rear and get good photos of the priest.  The ceremony eventually moved outside for a playing of taps, where I was able to get some great photographs.  


Overall, it was a great experience, and I got a ton of great shots (at least 10-15 keepers out of 100), but I only submitted 5 to the paper.  I haven't decided if I should upload the rest, but I may if there's enough demand. Family was supportive, funeral home staff was supportive, and no guests gave me the ""stinkeye.""  I think it made me a better photog. 

Ask me anything?

Right now we have 2 sponsors lined up for future competitions, [WideAngle](http://wideangle.com/) and [Thinktank](http://www.thinktankphoto.com/). Next Monday I will release the details of the [WideAngle](http://wideangle.com/) competition. Here is a [quick 46 second video](http://vimeo.com/58994425) that explains what WideAngle does.

* I will give out 1 month of reddit gold to 5 random people who add their usernames in the survey.
* Your username is optional and will be removed from the rest of your information and put into a separate doc that I'll only use once to give out the gold.
* I'm paying for the gold with money from our [amazon associates slush fund](http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/wn0ar/weekly_question_thread_ask_rphotography_anything/c5eplhg) (it's sitting at about $50 right now haha.)

1339214425.0,203,self.photography,usptx,"Pfft, I know what Fstops are.  But, the hell are Tstops?  Answers inside.",Scythels,262,59,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/usptx/pfft_i_know_what_fstops_are_but_the_hell_are/,"F/stops are the ratio of the focal length to the diameter of the iris (aperture) of the lens. T-stops are ratios of light that follow the same stepping as f-stops. IE: T-stops go T0.7-T1-T1.4-T2-T2.8, etc Just as F-stops do.

However, F-stops are not perfect. Because F-stops are a physical measurement and not a quantity of light, F2.8 =/= T2.8. Generally, the more actual elements of glass there are in a lens, the higher its max T-stop number is. That is not so easy to determine though, because elements are compounds of different glass types, and not every company uses the same compounds (eg: Canon's telephoto L lenses are usually white because fluorine glass - the primary type used in those lenses - suffers from thermal expansion at lower temperatures than whatever nikon/sigma/tamron use. I am not sure what the other makers use, but I know canon's white monsters use fluorine glass.)

Generally, f/stops are ""fine"". The difference between the F-stop your lens is set to and the T-stop it achieves is usually very marginal; the most extreme case I can find, Canon's 50 f1.2 loses between 1/2 stop and 1 full stop depending on what it's mounted on (on the quarter-stop scale 1.2 -&gt; 1.7 is one stop).

The difference is in lenses with massive numbers of elements. Take, for example, a Canon 85mm f1.2L. It uses only 8 elements and is F1.2. However, because the light transmission of those elements is lower than, say, a zeiss 14mm T1.6 with 15 elements, the T-stop is not actually 1.2. The 1.2's are extreme examples because their apertures are so massive, but a 85 f1.2L scores only T1.4 at its max aperture. Which is only a .33 EV loss in light; not a huge deal, but something to think about. Most lenses probably lose less than 1/8th of a stop (eg: an f2.8 would likely score T2.9 or T3).

F-stops are not perfect, thus the actual exposure of f/5.6 across a variety of lenses will vary just a little bit.

But who cares? In one word; cinematographers. When they're shooting a film with a half dozen primes they want their exposures to match exactly with no variance, because standards are that stringent. Lenses who's aperture rings (I've yet to see a lens measured in T-stops without one) that use T-stops are calibrated with some fancy-ungodly-expensive laser machine that shines a laser straight through the lens and measures its brightness at both ends. From there, they take each lens and look at it and go something like ""ok, this lens gets exactly T2.8 at F2.7"" and set the click in the ring to F2.7 and label it T2.8. Because of this calibration, T2.8 is identical across all lenses, whereas F2.8 is not.

Oh, and those $14,000+ cine primes are probably F1 or F1.1 to hit T1.6 and be sharp, free of distortion, and freeish of CA.

I think I've covered everything, but feel free to ask if I haven't.

Wouldn't it be nice to have the opportunity to get to know some of our peers a bit better? Perhaps gain an insight to an industry that might help us out with our own photography projects, whether professional or private? 

What I would really like to do, if the mods will allow it and perhaps even help promote it, is set up a weekly or monthly AMA with a photographer from a particular industry. We have nature photographers, product photographers, fashion photographers, photojournalists, etc. Obviously, though, we need volunteers. So if you are one of these (obviously not all are listed, but you know what I mean) and want to share your experiences and knowledge, please write below and let's work something out. 

Looking forward to the community's response - hope to see a lot of interest in this one!

EDIT: 

First, those of you that have already responded and are willing to volunteer your time: **THANK YOU!**

It looks like the community is definitely interested in something and I have the support of the mods. I'll give the thread another few days for people to respond and then I'll start sorting through replies. Once I've done that, I'll begin contacting everyone and work out a schedule. I imagine that this will turn into a biweekly thing, perhaps a monthly - we'll see how many have responded once I begin going through all the responses.

The prospect of ""missing a shot"" seems to bother a lot of people.

I can't help but feel that this sentiment is somewhat counter-productive (for some photographers). Always carrying your camera around seems to me that it would encourage thoughtless photography, mindless ""snapshots"" of everything, rather than well thought-out, well-composed photographs (especially in this day and age where the cost of film isn't an issue). 

When I go out shooting, I usually have a fairly clear image in mind of what I want to shoot, and I pack my bag and prepare accordingly (if I want to shoot landscapes I'll take a wide-angle lens for example). If I were just to carry a camera around planlessly (which I have done before) to ""hunt"" for an image that I don't quite know what it is I would just end up with a lot of boring shots.

Obviously, a lot would depend on what you're intending to shoot, if you're into photojournalism, you might have better luck ""hunting"" with your camera (I wouldn't be surprised if the ""always carry a camera"" advice had some link to the resurgence in, oftentimes fairly mediocre, street photography that is popular now), but it troubles me that this advice is being given to *everyone*, it seems to me that it, in some ways, will only generate more pictures of cats and crumpled coffee cups.

If anyone disagrees, don't hesitate to comment",,False,self,t5_2qh2a,False,,,True,t3_15krae,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/15krae/always_carry_a_camera_with_you/,

&gt; Edward drifts through space and time, here we can get a feel for what it might be like to ride through mother natures womb. The tube is the reason why we surf, the reason why we are driven to the ends of the earth. To feel time slow, to exhale, to wonder. How can you say that you have stood in a room where the walls were made of water and lived to tell the tale? For Edward, this is just another day

&gt; This is Austrian athlete Mich Kemeter, 25, climbing the last pitch of ""Marches du Temps"" (6a+) in France's Gorges du Verdon, 300m off the deck, without a rope or any protection device. From the first time I met and shot with Mich, a few years ago in Yosemite, he has performed impressive feats in climbing and highlining with and without ropes. On this particular trip to Verdon, he climbed, roped, a number of very difficult routes, BASE jumped several times and walked several new highlines, then climbed this very exposed but relatively easy climb.

&gt; I shot this while hanging from a 25m highline. I used a Nikon D4 and a Nikkor 16-35 f/4 VR at 16mm, f/8, 1/500 and ISO 800.

&gt; I shot this at about 6am at Kirby Cove in the Marin Headlands. Walking down a dirt trail in the pitch black isn't my favorite thing to do, but I had always wanted to go down to the Cove and I just happened to have a day off of work. I spent about an hour down there, the wind was pretty intense (glad I brought some gloves). I edited this using primarily lightroom (vibrance, sharpness, NR, and the adjustment brush), but I also used Nik's LR plug-in to bring out the shadows and a bit more color. I also snagged this shot when it was still a bit darker: http://flickr.com/photos/tsipes/8512073038/. Glad you all have liked the photo, win or lose, it's always good to know that a few people have appreciated it!

&gt; I shot this photo in early April of this year while coming back to my home in Juneau from a visit to Skagway, Alaska. The way from Skagway to Juneau involves a 6 hour ferry ride and it usually leaves in mid afternoon, so as long as the weather is nice, you will usually have some good lighting during part of your ride.  Just past Haines, you sail past the Davidson Glacier, and on this occasion, the lighting made me stop the conversation I was having mid sentence and start shooting. In post, I boosted saturation, did some work with levels and curves, and did a slight crop to straighten the photo (it was hand held with a non IS 70-200 f/2.8)

&gt; This photograph was taken during Thunder Over Louisville, an enormous annual fireworks show. I had only photographed fireworks once before and hadn't been pleased with the results, so for this event I set up one camera on a tripod to create a time lapse and I shot handheld with a second camera, hoping to get something interesting from one or the other. This shot was taken handheld during the finale of the fireworks. There was so much smoke that the explosions made sky look like it was full of galaxies, and luckily I was able to capture that on camera.

&gt; This was taken just after the England v Brazil game in February. I had the shot on my mind for some time since I passed the spot every day when commuting to university. It actually took me a while to shoot because I kept missing the games (Big thanks here to my flatmate who reminded me). This was initally going to be just a quick timelapse but I figured it might be more striking as a photo. Also, if you look closely, you can see Sirius just above the stadium arch.

&gt; Heather Dufty on her splitboard, standing atop of the Cham Chutes in the Blackcomb backcountry.  The wind was howling up the chute stirring up a lot of air born snow, which is what provided the grainy film look.  Just as we were about to drop in, we noticed there had been a fairly large avalanche on an extremely popular traverse on the ridge next to us.  We decided we would head in that direction to see if we could offer any help, but by the time we got there everything had been taken care of.  There had been a few people caught in the avalanche, one of them buried for up to four minutes and had been dug out just in the nick of time.

**Second Place**

http://i.minus.com/i01jJl8Q8ljbo.jpg

&gt; I took this shot on Christmas Eve, 2011 after about four hours on site. As most people know it is of one of the Japan's famous ""snow monkeys"" who bathe in a hot spring during the winter, some of the most photographed subjects in Japan. The challenging thing about the environment is that wisps of steam flow back and forth across the hot spring, and sometimes you can see almost nothing of the monkeys. There is also a continuous jostle between other tourists. What makes this shot interesting is the human-like expression as if the juvenile macaque was enjoying slipping into a warmth bath, but in fact, it was in the middle of eating seeds thrown in by staff.

**First Place**

http://i.minus.com/iblPbNHQTlDnc.jpg

&gt;I've had it that day. Bad day at work, it was freezing out there and after finally arriving home I realized that I forgot to buy a cable I desperately needed that day. Went back to the city in the best mood you could imagine. When I left the store all of a sudden it started snowing in a way I haven't seen in years. I stopped walking, looked around, grabbed my camera that I luckily took with me (best tip ever: just take the cam with you all the time, especially when you are into street photography) and started shooting. My dark blue jacket was snow white after 30 minutes out there. People thought I was crazy for just standing there in the snow storm. Turns out I am. Crazy about photography.

So while walking from the train station to my office, I saw an opportunity and took my camera out. While setting the settings I wanted, a woman carrying an entry level DSLR (Nikon D3000 I believe, only caught a quick glance of it) approached me holding her camera and proceeded to tell me:


""Oh nice little camera, but you gotta have a camera like this (Holds her camera in my face) to be a good photographer. You should get one if you really want to be any good.""

So many amateurs are pushed towards Nikon and Canon, but there are fantastic alternatives out there... and from the way I see it, Sony is innovating at a fast pace. Rumor has it, new full-frame cameras are coming out next year.

It is for my final year dissertation - the project depends entirely upon getting your opinions. PLEASE HELP!,JNBeckett,271,87,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/18e88j/please_complete_this_short_photography_survey/,"Survey closed, thanks to all that participated! Amazing response! I will post the results once they are ready.

**Background for those interested:**
 
I’m a final year Information Management and Business Studies student at Loughborough University. I’ve also done a year in industry, in marketing at Canon UK.

You can find endless amounts of valuable information online. There are vast amounts of knowledge, insightful discussions and interesting ideas - but how much do companies really utilise social media and message boards? A lot of market research is done ‘offline’. Little is understood about how to engage and work with customers online, their willingness to co-operate and the value they can bring. 

My dissertation looks at the knowledge of customers in online communities such as /r/photography, and the possibility of it be shared with companies to create superior products. This survey is a crucial part of my final year project, as I need to know how you feel about this idea. I need to understand who you are and why you use this subreddit. I’m also carrying out other research to determine the feasibility of sharing knowledge online.

To be clear, this research is not being commissioned by Canon, or any other camera manufacturer, but I may share the results of my project with them and anyone else interested. No contact details will be shared with anyone, I will only use your email address once (if you choose to supply it) to email you the results of the study.

I really appreciate your time, thanks for reading and (hopefully) upvoting!

First I was thinking to silently contact guy and ask him to take my work off from his portfolio, but then decided to share my finding before he could react: the guy have to learn the lesson.

We all know that our images can be stolen and used without permission, on websites, blogs, and this does not bother me that much. But the worst case when they being stolen by other photographer, the guy from the same community, and used as his/her own work.
What he was thinking about?

I did some stop motion work with a model recently, and because I had hi-res stills and the opportunity to present in a gallery I printed some off and last night a few of them sold. 

These are digital prints, with the source file on my computer and therefore infinitely reproducible.  One customer suggested he would want to pay more for it to be a one-of-a-kind or a signed and numbered series.  Having dabbled in traditional printmaking I understand the concept, but don't see how I can offer that with an entirely digital creation.  

What are the methods and means of creating a digital print series?

How do you sign and number a photograph?  Is it proper to do so only on the matboard, or is there a way to sign the back without damaging the print?

Is there any literature reddit might recommend on the subject of selling photography?

Does r/photography have any recommendations for better behaviour in selling work in the future?

Thank you all for any thoughts.

Edit:  Thank you all for the enthusiasm and discussion.  The two articles linked in the comments present an excellent philosophy of numbering Editions and Printings, allowing for vintage prints to collect value without imposing an artificial limit on their production.  I've sold two more prints since posting this, finally making enough from them to pay for the model, my materials, and my labor (albeit at minimum wage).  It's been an incredible week.  I would really wish I could share them with you here for a critique, but they have personal identifiers in the watermark.

As I was going through the x-ray, my Pelican case got flagged for ""explosives screening"" and got pulled off the belt by a TSA agent.   

He opened the case, and swabbed its interior with the swab, and then proceeded to try to close the case. When it didn't close the way he thought it should, he started applying extreme pressure to the latches while leaning on the case with all of his weight.  

""It doesn't work that way"" I said. ""You have to fully pop the latches open before they will close."" (A feature of the Pelican line.)  

He mumbled something, snapped the latches, and whisked the case off the counter to hand it to me... when I noticed that he hadn't actually latched the case properly. Cue visions of everything in the case spilling out across the floor. Oh fuck.   

""Whoa whoa whoa man it's not latched!""   

""Oh geez - sorry!"" he said. Thankfully, he put his hand against the lid and placed it down on the floor, and a near disaster was avoided. He was nice enough, just a little clueless about how the case worked.  

I don't even want to imagine the nightmare of trying to get the TSA to replace $6k worth of gear, but I'd hazard a guess that it's deeply unpleasant process.  

**TL;DR: keep an eye on the TSA agents when they are inspecting your carry-on gear.*

Just learnt a very expensive lesson and thought I would share in the hope that one of you beautiful people will avoid such a costly mistake. 

Being a wedding photog I tend to push my flash hard and as such I was going through batteries and quite a rate. Looking around it turned out it was *much* cheaper to buy Duracells in bulk off eBay rather than in a shop (50p a unit rather than £1.50 a unit) so I purchased about a 100 batteries. 

Big mistake. 

Within a few days the batteries leaked and have ruined my speedlight. Just got  the repair quote back from Nikon and it is, to coin a frase, [proper fucked:](http://i.imgur.com/2BOX8.jpg). Turns out, despite perfect packaging and looking legit the batteries were fakes. 

Moral of the story is avoid bulk batteries, pay a bit more and buy them in the shop. Trust me when I say it is cheaper in the long run.

Tl:DR - Fake Duracells leaked in my flash and ruined it, don't buy in bulk off eBay. 

Edit: Thanks for all the info one and all. Not sure why I such a problem with rechargeable but I have just invested in Eneloops XX on Amazon! Your are amazing as ever!

So I know that most of us (including me) don't have tons of money. I have access to a lot of manual lenses, and I was wondering if there would be any interest in a comparison between a lot of manual lenses. Some of them would include the:

Pentax Super Takumar 50/1.8

Mamiya Sekor 55/1.4

Nikon 50/1.2 AI-s

Nikon 50/1.8 AI-s

Olympus OM Zuiko 50/1.8

I will only do it if there is interest in it being done, because it would be a bit of work.

Go to a dog park, turn off your AF on your lens, and try to get good, clean shots of dogs in motion.  One of my early mentors told me this, which I reluctantly tried, and I noticed a marked improvement in my speed when manually focusing and, more importantly, I stopped second guessing my framing and depth of field once I saw what I wanted.  

It's also loads of fun to shoot active dogs.  They don't give two shits about you having a camera.  They're just themselves.

For example, I found some Gaffing tape at work this morning, and decided to make some DIY vignette shades for my lens. You can do it [vertically](http://i.imgur.com/DZrqC.jpg) or even [horizontally](http://i.imgur.com/d8hhd.jpg). Depending on what aperture setting you use, you can control how strong the effect is; higher aperture makes the edges harder, lower aperture makes them less noticeable.

[Here's one shot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/67577064@N04/7584560394/sizes/l/in/photostream/) with the shades going vertical, and [another](http://www.flickr.com/photos/67577064@N04/7584562252/sizes/l/in/photostream/) with the same setup. ([rest of portfolio](http://www.skylight.cc))

Back up your stuff, peeps! My hard drive on a less-than-a-year-old laptop failed. As a student this is sort of a big hit. About 900GB of data gone. Only about 250GB were backed up. On 8/16/2013 (I purchased my laptop 8/16/2012 I was going to give my laptop a fresh 128GB SSD and a 2TB external drive to store all my photos / data. Wasn't expecting my hard drive to fail less than a year in. But they *do* fail so back up your stuff now!  

I'm not a professional photographer. So I guess I'm thankful that I'm only losing photos and not clients on top of money or whatever compensation that I'd have to provide for them. 

My drive was partitioned so that I had about 300GB on my C drive and my D drive was all neat (with school stuff too). On the D drive there were some 200GB in photos and another 300GB or so of video work that I've done... that's photos with my girlfriend, freshman year, fun times, etc. Photos that I want to recover but am really, really considering if I can afford the data recovery (they're more expensive than I thought) as an undergrad. 

What's pissing me off the most I guess is that there were some 5000 photos of a timelapse project that I was working on. Ka-put! I thought I had backed this up to my external HDD but apparently not. 

Some of these photos are up on Facebook but more's on my hard drive than not online. 

So folks, back up your data **today.** Don't wait! I thought it would be okay to wait since my drive was less than a year old, but damn, I'm stumped now. I know people are going to say, ""Oh why didn't you do this earlier, blah blah"" but I spent most of my $$$s on the laptop and camera gear. 

Cheers and hope this doesn't happen to you. 

PS: Anyone know of any cheap data recovery centres located in Korea? 

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the support! Looks like the PSA got around to a lot of you. :) Better back up today rather than be sorry like myself!

There are several things you can and should do to get the most out of the images from your P&amp;S. If you use it correctly people won't know with what camera the shot was taken. [Here's an image](http://polarlightssvalbard.com/Svalbard_small.jpg), guess with what camera it was taken; I'll give you the answer at the end of the post.

Now; the first thing you'll need to learn are the general limitations of P&amp;S cameras. Here's a list.

* Low dynamic range (Range of tones of gray that the camera can see; or what the brightest and darkest thing in an image can be where you still see detail)

* Slow autofocus

* Often poor manual controls

* Large depth of field

* Doesn't capture raw images

* Poor high ISO performance (noise in images taken in low light)

The big issues are the low dynamic range and the large depth of field. These two are the biggest issues which make images taken from a P&amp;S look ""amateur"" compared to images taken with a DSLR.

**How do I work around these problems?**

First we'll tackle the low dynamic range. This issue produces two symptoms in images. The first one is that you often get your foreground underexposed and sky overexposed which makes the photo look unpleasent.  [Here's an example](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77620/example2.jpg). This is an image taken outside during a cloudy day. As you can see the ground and people are a bit dark and the sky is nearly totally white. Not really a pretty photo. What caused this to happen?

This image was taken quite up north in Svalbard during the summer when the sun is always up high. But in a normal part of the world this would equate to taking a photo at around noon. This is when the sun is at it's brightest which means the clouds are at their brightest. The second thing that creates this scene with a lot of dynamic range (difference between light and dark) is the fact that the photographer is shooting towards where the sun would be. This is the brightest part of an already bright sky. And since the ground is mostly dark rocks which reflect little light you have a scene with more dynamic range than what a P&amp;S can show you. How do you work around this? Simple, NEVER shoot towards the sun if you want both the sky and foreground to be well exposed. [Here's another example](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77620/example3.jpg). This is a very simmilar image taken the day after the previous. Same place, same time of day (though that is irrelevant in Svalbard during the summer since the sun is just as high in the sky). The only difference between this and the previous image is that this one is shot away from the sun. This photo is also slightly edited; most noticeably the sky has been darkened with a curves layer and a layer mask. [Heres the original to better compare it with the previous example](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77620/example4.jpg). See, the unedited image is also better than the other one, simply for shooting in a different direction. Here the reason the ground is so dark is because the camera exposed the scene with 18% grey in mind, but that's for another lesson. The second problem of lack of dynamic range in P&amp;S cameras is that the blown out area is oftentimes VERY unappealing. Instead of just loosing information to light you get weird colorshifts at the border of the overexposed area. [Here's one showing a cyan shift](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77620/example5.jpg). This is almost impossible to fix. Avoid it.
[Here's a shot almost against the sun that DOES work, because it does not rely on having the foreground correctly exposed.](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77620/example6.jpg).

Onwards.

The problem with slow autofocus is easy. Don't shoot moving things, or if you do focus on a point and wait until the thing that's moving is at that point, then take the photo. Just be aware of the lag between pressing the shutter button and taking the photo. This technique requires A LOT of practice before getting it right. This is how sports photos of eg. race cars were taken before cameras had autofocus. Some old dogs still do this.

Onwards.

Often poor manual controls. This is also quite an easy problem. Either shoot in auto mode or if your camera has it use aperture priority. You only need to adjust the exposure compensation anyway. Most P&amp;S cameras aren't designed with manual use in mind and therefore are very difficult and time consuming to use if you use them in manual mode. Most however work quite well in aperture priority mode since the exposure compensation feature is often just a button press away.

Onwards. Large depth of field.
One thing with cameras with large sensors (DSLRs et. al.) is that the area that is sharp is quite thin and the area which is blurry is quite large. This is an effect of a large sensor and a large aperture. You can only recreate this using post processing. Simply avoid taking photos where you would like this effect. This means when you're taking portraits you'll have to think A LOT more about your backgrounds because you can't hide them in the blur of a large aperture. You're backgrounds will show in all their ugliness. Try to find pretty backgrounds.

Onwards. Doesn't capture raw images. This is a bit of biggie too, but not such a large problem. If your camera has the settings turn the sharpness, noise reduction to their lowest levels. Also put saturation and contrast to 0 (DON'T have the camera reduce these below 0; you just want the camera to not raise these; you want to do it yourself). All cameras apply post processing to the photos you take before the camera saves the photos to the memorycard. Ideally you want to control this on a per image basis and not have the camera do it for you. You do a MUCH better job at this.

Onwards. Poor high ISO performance. Just don't shoot when it's dark. Or if you have to do it like this. Before going out and shooting test your camera at home. Set the ISO from 100 all the way to the maximum your camera has. Choose highest one that you find still acceptable as the highest you'll ever use. Now when you're at your friends party put your camera to this ISO, the largest aperture you can (smallest number) and put the camera on timer mode. Now either attach the camera to a small tripod or just set it on a table and press the shutter and wait until the timer takes a photo. Don't forget to turn off the flash and set the white balance to incandescent (if your shooting in a room thats lit with lightbulbs).

And now download photoshop (the trial version) and search youtube for photoshop curves tutorials and photoshop layer mask tutorials. Boom, now you're taking better photos than 90 % of people with DSLRs'.

1. People use the term to be a jackass and invade others' personal space. That ""uncomfortable"" feeling that all the workshops are trying to get you to overcome? I think maybe you should listen to that. Maybe this is a symptom of me not living in NYC or Paris or London. 
2. Abusive use of black+white. In cooking, if you take something ""blah"" and wrap it in bacon, it becomes ""amazing,"" but most chefs will consider that cheating of sorts. B+W seems a bit like cheating in the same way. Family Guy riffed on this, but it seems like the formula is ""Oh, this photo is boring. Let's make it black and white and pump the contrast!"" Along those lines...
3. Abusive post-processing. I generally hate HDR, in the same way that I hate over-sharpening and over-saturation, etc. It seems like the street tag invites more post-processing that just turns them from OK to ugly. It's like the first time you discover the lens flare plugin in photoshop. It's cool for a while, then it's a crutch, then it's horrible. 
3. It's a wrapper term to excuse some really terrible photographs. Badly composed scenes, blown highlights, invisible shadows, angled horizons... but call it ""street"" and suddenly people seem to love this stuff? 
4. Finally, and this is my primary complaint: the pictures are almost never interesting. They're like the Seinfeld of photographs. Maybe these guys live for the 1 in 10000 photo, I know I don't. I'm looking for 1 good photo every 10 or so shots. But a picture of someone in an umbrella in the rain? Or a guy hopping onto a curb? Or a blurry reflection in an ad in a metro station? Those just aren't compelling to me, at all. I generally try to take pictures where I might want the end result hung up in my house, and there are practically zero street photographs where that's true. 

Now, I don't want to seem all angry and bitter, so here's the things I like about the ethos: 

1. The focus on the photographer and their bond with the equipment. One camera, one lens. Learn the ins and outs of it. I like that idea. Really gets away from the circlejerking of lens/body/etc. Just take some damn pictures! :). 
2. Focus on taking photos everywhere, every day. There's no better way to get intimately acquainted with your gear, even a minimal setup, than using it all the time. 
3. Focusing more on the artistic aspects of photography. Some people can take better photos, from an artistic perspective, with an iphone than you can with your 3000 dollar full-frame body and 2500 dollar lens. But there's slightly less chromatic abberation! \*eye roll\*. 

So I guess for enthusiasts: what draws you to street photography? How do you differentiate street photography vs any other kind of photography? It seems that if the subject is interesting and there is a story to tell or scene to expose, that's just photography. Thoughts?
