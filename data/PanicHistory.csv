1333607813.0,67,self.PanicHistory,ruaru,"A compilation of panics within the post ""Jon Stewart: While everyone fights over SCOTUS and health care, the same Court just gave the police permission to strip search every one of us.""",,93,26,218,http://www.reddit.com/r/PanicHistory/comments/ruaru/a_compilation_of_panics_within_the_post_jon/,"Hello again, PH. There is just so much material in [this one r/politics post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rstbg/jon_stewart_while_everyone_fights_over_scotus_and/) that I can't help myself here. I must compile it all!

**Context**

I'm sure you've hear about the Supreme Court 5-4 decision to approve of strip searches for any arrest. If you haven't, [here's a New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/us/justices-approve-strip-searches-for-any-offense.html) on the matter.

Personally, I think it's an improper decision. However, there are two things you need to understand about this case which a level-headed pwnchalet explains well:

[First, the Court said the strip search was only justified when the person was being processed into jail. Specifically, into jail, among other prisoners. A simple arrest is not enough.
Second, the Court did not give ""permission."" The Court said that the 4th Amendment does not give individuals the right to be free from strip searches upon entering jail. In other words, strip searches at the jailhouse gate do not violate the 4th Amendment. But if a particular jail forbids such searches, police cannot cite this case and claim to have ""permission"" notwithstanding.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rstbg/jon_stewart_while_everyone_fights_over_scotus_and/c48dyp8)

Additionally, if you *are* illegally strip-searched, you can still seek justice through the court system. For example, last year in my hometown of New York, the District Court of New York ruled that over 100,000 claimants in a class-action lawsuit were to be awarded $33 million by the City of New York for being illegally strip-searched and detained. [Link](http://nycstripsearch.com/)

Redditors, however, believe this is another irreversible encroachment on their civil liberties. Are you surprised? I've compiled a list of some pretty intense panicky behavior over what they perceive to be yet another advance of fascism into the U.S. Without further ado, let us begin.

*Here I am, destatiforze, wandering the mystical land of r/politics. It is a strange land; the hinterlands of political discourse wherein tin foil hats replace the flora. I wander into this post, cutting through the thicket of sensationalism with a sharpened cutlass.*

&gt;Being arrested does not mean you are guilty of anything, therefore there is some perceived innocence until you are convicted of a crime. While you are in the custody of the police, it is not carte blanche to abuse you at their discretion.
This is one of many laws that will be applied arbitrarily whenever the police need to intimidate citizens, because after all, they are not required to strip search you, but they will if they need to put you in your place
&gt; &gt;[Well said. It's seems like all these new bills as of late are designed specifically/intentionally to be open to interpretation and leave way to much head room for abuse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rstbg/jon_stewart_while_everyone_fights_over_scotus_and/c48h37m) [+273]

""I'm not saying they're specifically designed to oppress poor redditors like us, but I'm saying they're specifically designed to oppress poor redditors like us."" I wish he'd at least be honest with himself. It's like he knows putting on the tin foil hat is a bad thing, but he really, really wants to.

This pussyfooting brings about the real shit though in response:

[Because, our generation is going to witness the breakdown of civil liberties and individual rights. Things such as the patriot act have slowly eroded it, unchecked.
It makes me wonder if we didn't start this ghost war against the middle east just to have a boogyman so that the government could do this with some kind of reason](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rstbg/jon_stewart_while_everyone_fights_over_scotus_and/c48jp37) [+46]

Something that really bugs me about responses like this is that redditors deal with some weird dissonant dichotomy here. On one hand, the U.S. federal government is an inept heap of idiocy that couldn't find themselves out of a paper bag, yet on the other the government is secretly undermining the entire American populace and eroding their civil liberties. All 435 federal representatives, all 100 federal senators, all federal 3,492 judges appointed by those 535 individuals, and the entire executive office of the President are out to get you. Depending on the situation, both can apply! 

I digress though. Here it comes, the moment you've all been waiting for:

[This is how Nazi Germany and Hitler came to power, Blame someone (groups) for the countries problems Eg. Jews (Terrorists /Muslims).

I don't see the first three posts as particularly panicky (albeit stupid), but oh man do I love that last post. What a gem. Let's get back to the panic!

[It says ""booked into jail"". Who goes to jail for eating on a subway or not wearing a seatbelt? Am I missing something here? I guess when some guys gets locked up with a shank up his ass stabs the shit out of someone, the people will cry ""How'd they let him in there with that?!"".

[+13,+118,+58]

In a linguistic sense, that last post is *genius*. It sounds very threatening while being so vague that you don't know *who the aggressor is*. Watch as this redditor uses the passive voice to avoid clarifying any noun that marks how stupid and panicky this thought actually is. It's like these redditors believe that robots are coming to get them. Keep up the dehumanization, douchebag.

[And knowing is half the battle? Does this surprise anybody anymore? If things do not improve by the time I'm done with my degree I'm hopping off of this festering ship...

That's why ""annoying a cop"" is illegal in every jurisdiction- they will find something, and it will stick, because there is a law that you have broken, and they will find it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rstbg/jon_stewart_while_everyone_fights_over_scotus_and/c48fzg3) [+90]

""The powers that be?"" I'm really starting to think that redditors think we're at war with a robot hivemind instead of a collective of differently-minded PEOPLE with checks and balances everywhere in the system. And yes, this collective is actively looking to bring retribution down upon you if you piss off cops.

Hello, r/PH! Today, *it begins.* This thread set off my panic-sensors for three reasons:

* Vague prediction of doom! ""It begins"" today. What you may ask? I don't know, but it does!

* Followed by the passive voice! ""Anonymous considered terrorists now..."" Neat! *Who* considers them terrorists? My mom? My doctor? The sentence is purposely structured like this so those who are looking to fill in the gaps in conspiracy narrative will get what's implied by the passive voice here.

* It links to a youtube video! I was expecting Prison Planet or something. Unfortunately, I got TYT. 

Up first for the panickers is [Dat_Wolf_Pack](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/qos6f/it_begins_anonymous_considered_terrorists_now_and/c3z98vh) who posts:

""I remember a time when the term 'terrorist' wasn't abstract bullshit.""

Which by itself is a fair enough quote as the word ""terrorist"" is a pretty nebulous term, but how does r/politics interpret this seemingly benign post?

[""If you don't agree with those in power, Congratulations your a terrorist! Funny thing about free speech here in America, we all have it, as long as you agree with what the Feds are saying.

You heard it here, folks. Dissent is now *literally* terrorism. We are now almost literally North Korea. We are so oppressed here. ;_;

Luckily, we have someone who can rub two brain cells together and he questions this sentiment. holger-danske posts:

He cites that nazi-esque H.R. 347 bill. It's just too bad that the ACLU [completely disagrees with this sentiment](http://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/how-big-deal-hr-347-criminalizing-protest-bill) (you know, the organization that consists of actual lawyers and of people who've been involved in civil liberty legislation and court proceedings for almost a century now). The ACLU believes that ""H.R. 347 is of incremental importance,"" but could ""be misused as part of a larger move by the Secret Service and others to suppress lawful protest."" You know, just like *any other law out there today.*

1984 and Nazi Germany all in one post! Gotta love it. 

At this post of sifting through this shit, I just want to say that *nobody even fucking commented on the ""headline.* The quote that TYT is freaking out about is this:

""In the not too distant future we anticipate that the cyber threat will pose the number one thread to our country.""

Nobody is labeling Anonymous as terrorists. Robert Mueller doesn't even mention Anonymous once. In fact, he was speaking of *state-sponsored hackers* as the context of this quote. He continues:

""State-sponsored hackers are patient and calculating. They have the time, money and resources to burrow in and wait. You may discover one breach only to find that the real damage has been done at a much higher level."" [source](http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/02/technology/fbi_cybersecurity/index.htm)

It's a great source of comedy to me and has been since I joined the site in early 2009. 

I remember laughing about how the USA was going to start loading people into trains and sending them to FEMA prison camps or how George W. Bush was going to authorize the use of the US military against American citizens thus ushering in a neo-facist empire where he is the God-King of the west.

It's easy to point out how everyone with a fucking internet connection is an economist/soothsayer/political analyst these days or laugh when one of these prophecies doesn't come true but I think there is some very interesting psychological stuff going on here. 

Reddit (or more generally the internet) is a little different from printed media. When you print a newspaper, it immediately becomes old. Within a day it is dated and you're held accountable for what you said back when the paper was printed. However when you submit a reddit comment you're basically adding a drop of water to a moving stream. You're engaging in real time so by the time anyone tries to hold you accountable for what you say, the world has moved on and no longer cares.

This may seem obvious to you guys but I think this model of information transfer is really poisonous for the paranoid doomsday prophets of our community. If you declare on TV or in print that the rapture is coming next March and you're wrong, you have to make an apology or at least be held accountable and publicly wrong/crazy. However if you say ""FEMA is going to put us all into work camps and the army will mobilize against us in October."" you're never held accountable. Reddit moves on and you're free to spew lies and spread unfounded fear and hate to others.

As if that wasn't enough, when a future crisis DOES happen it is used to rationalize the already existing paranoia and prophecy. This results in a culture where you can literally start panicking now and justify it later because by the time anyone looks to hold you accountable reddit has moved on.

In short, I'm glad this subreddit exists. These people should be made accountable for sewing unfounded panic.

**And my personal favorite:**

[So how to stop the downward spiral of our state? Do we abandon emails, and facebooks, and social media sites like this one? Toss out our cellphones, unplug our TVs and not drive our smart cars? This is some sort of snake from which the head must understand it is eating it's body. An Oroborus of sorts.

While I am overjoyed at the prospect of moving on with my life and career, it unfortunately means that my freetime is going to be nonexistent for the next seven years or so. As such, I won't be able to spend much time on reddit reading truly awful, histrionic opinions and posting them here, or be around to ok the odd post that gets nabbed by the spam filter.

I start in early September, so we have time to fill my pending vacancy. I'd like to get some feedback on who to bring in for the mod spot. Do any regular posters/submitters want in? Would anyone mind if we brought in an established mod from /r/conspiratard? There's always the option of just handing this place over to /r/shitredditsays. They certainly have eager mods, and the Fempire theme did look nice a couple April Fool's ago...

I'm happy to see how well this little subreddit has grown over the last year and a half. And I'm really proud of the level-headed and mature community we've assembled here. It seems like those qualities are rapidly disappearing in the default subreddits, but it's good to see that there's still some sanity left on the site.

Thank you guys for contributing to /r/PanicHistory and sharing my incredulity at what gets upvoted. I hope that in the years to follow, I can come back here and see the latest reddit predictions about our imminent doom.

Let's get a discussion going on what this subreddit is and what we want this subreddit to be going forward. Here's my take on it:

I think we're leaning a little too much towards a ""SRSpolitics"" tone. There are a lot of threads and posts that need to be critically examined beyond the usual ultra cynical, conspiratorial, and sensationalized bias flagrant on reddit, but I don't believe that r/PanicHistory should be that place to do so. A post can be very outlandish, but it doesn't need to predict imminent disaster. I hate to point fingers at others, so I'll just choose a post from r/OccupyWallStreet:

[Vulture Capitalism doesn't care about the dignity of life. Vulture Capitalism exploits the weak to enrich the few. Stop Vulture Capitalism.](http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/pxtf6/vulture_capitalism_doesnt_care_about_the_dignity/)

And the image is of an Indian child in a boat wading through a ""sea"" of garbage. While this is stupid and overly sensationalized, it isn't predicting imminent disaster so I don't believe it belongs here in Panic History.

For an example of something I do want to see in Panic History, look at the sidebar. Predictions of implementation of martial law? Fascist takeover? Looming U.S. war with Iran? These are all good topics to post here. The ultimate goal, for me, is to document them all and then retaliate with posts like [this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ppdj8/greenwald_time_and_again_americans_support/c3r8las) 

You aren't limited to those choices either, but I believe we should use discretion and to make sure that there's a general sense of hysteria or irrational behavior surrounding a post or headline before you cross-post it here.

It seems like, if this subreddit is for cataloging events where a large or somewhat large portion of reddit legitimately freaked out about something, posts with low upvote counts shouldn't, by definition, really be appropriate.

I've thought about this a lot, having watched this subreddit grow since its inception a few months ago (this is a new account--I stopped using my old one as I found that it was popular enough that people were upvoting/downvoting my comments based on the fact that it was me, rather than the content), and previously I had considered that posters would exercise their good judgment about posting panics. Increasingly, however, I'm noticing that we're kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel with some of these posts--due in no small part to the fact that much of the panicky posts have already been posted (thanks to the diligence of people like madfrogurt and basementdad, notably). As hysterical as reddit tends to be, the true hysteria isn't constant enough to supply the number of people who want to post here.

**I would propose that ~50 upvotes (maybe ~100 for /r/politics) should be a suggested minimum for a post here, with extreme preference shown to posts that have garnered more.**

Obviously I have absolutely no authority, but I think this is a conversation we ought to have.

&gt;Your pittance will never be able to beat out the billions that get dumped into ""our"" ""representatives"" pockets by lobbyists for corporate America.

&gt;If you are participating in the political process by writing to those that don't give a crap about you or your interests and concerns and then voting for their sanctioned candidates, well, then it is a good sign as far as they are concerned.

&gt;Understand what we really face. Short of violent, bloody revolution, there is only one way to have your voice heard and change things at this point. And that is from outside the system by engaging in mass civil disobedience and direct action campaigns.



This may sound harsh but are you serious? Your Vote? Please. Your vote hasn't mattered in at least 30 years. And your money? That is an even bigger joke. That is unless you are the CEO of some major corporation with the means to buy the politicians. Your pittance will never be able to beat out the billions that get dumped into ""our"" ""representatives"" pockets by lobbyists for corporate America.
If you are really looking for answers then you will need to understand and internalize the following: We do not live in a functioning representative republic in any positive sense of that term. What we live in is an inverted totalitarian Kleptocracy where ""democracy"" is managed. Managed to keep you participating in their rigged system. Voting is all they want you to do. If you are participating in the political process by writing to those that don't give a crap about you or your interests and concerns and then voting for their sanctioned candidates, well, then it is a good sign as far as they are concerned. They know they still have you hoodwinked. Your vote doesn't matter and, unless there are hard-core, fundamental changes to our political process, it never will again.
Seriously, follow the link below and have your eyes opened. Read the source material. Understand what we really face. Short of violent, bloody revolution, there is only one way to have your voice heard and change things at this point. And that is from outside the system by engaging in mass civil disobedience and direct action campaigns. But that takes actual effort from the masses. Not the effort it takes to write a check or the 30 minutes it takes to vote.
