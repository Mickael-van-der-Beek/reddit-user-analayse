However, now they will have to explain religion from scratch if they don't want to appear inarticulate, which basically ends with them admitting they have no idea what it is that they are worshiping or they just shut up from exhaustion from too many cycles through their retardation circuit.

Although this method rarely ends in a de-conversion, you will not have to waste your time and energy explaining things that will just end up going in one ear and out the other.  It also helps them realize where the fallacy lies within their own religion.

My parents knew I was having some sort of religious conflict, and brought their biblical scholar friend  to discuss Jesus with me. I started debating them about certain things in the Bible, but I never really got a straight answer. They were mainly justified with faith and some irrelevant answer. I eventually just came out as an atheist, and the debate got a little more heated because they didn't know how to answer from a secular point of view. I showed them the evidence for evolution, and they still insisted that evolution was not true. I explained how intelligence and evolution produced human emotions, but they were stubborn and still insisted that it would take a god to make emotions. I was kinda raising my voice at this point. I asked that they show evidence for God, they used the Bible. I explained to them how this is not evidence, but they still used their faith argument, and how faith does validate religion. The debate eventually just stopped, and later that night, my parents came to my room talking to me about how disappointed they were, and how close minded I am. We just got into another heated argument, and they were talking about how I am unintelligent for not believing due to lack of evidence. Then I got furious(testosterone?) and shouted to them that there is no god. After that my dad just snorted and left the room telling me how close-minded I was. I said, ""Have fun believing in a magic sky fairy who judges based off of beliefs, and not morals.""


I understand where angry atheists come from now. I used to think that they were just assholes, but I understand now that it's theists who raise them to that point.

I asked my wife, who is still a (very liberal) believer, if she could compromise with me and stop putting money toward the church.


Instead, I asked her if we could give the money to organizations who would do good without indoctrinating anyone, without attacking gays, without telling people that they're hell-bound scum if they don't believe exactly what the church believes.

And pardon the possible disorganization, this is a stream of consciousness that I've been wanting to share for a while... It's a little long, but bear with me...

For the first 15 years of my life I was Christian girl. When I was a young child, I didn't know much about any other life outside of being a Christian. I thought everyone went to church and believed in Jesus Christ. My parents didn't say a word about any other faith to me. I started to understand what it meant to be a Christian after moving halfway across the country to the east coast. I had lost all my friends from my original home. There was solace in church. I didn't think much of it. I don't think I thought at all, in fact. I went along with it and followed the pre-teens to retreats. I had fun and volunteered to be baptized with the FULLEST OF HEARTS A CHRISTIAN COULD EVER HAVE.

I was very devout. I know what it's like to ""feel God"" or ""Jesus"" or ""the Holy Spirit"". It is a VERY powerful psychological and emotional experience. So much so that attempts to feel it again can lead to irrational, dangerous acts and thoughts. Anyway, at church I saw hypocrisy all around me that contradicted the bible that I had read and followed: Homosexuality, drunkeness, drug use, adultery... Even in my age group. It pushed me further into my corner. Alone with God. I witnessed -- looking from the outside in -- sex destroying some of my peers' sanity and coming very close to ruining a family member's life.

NO ONE ever talked to me about sex. Ever. I think by the time I was in middle school, the only thing I knew for sure about sex was: penis + vagina = sex... and that was it. I avoided movies and TV shows that depicted sex. Those that I accidentally witnessed always depicted it in a scandalous light, as if it were something evil or -- if it was nice -- had extreme negative consequences. The parents didn't speak to me about this. I avoided conversations at school. I thought it was evil because that was what had been taught to me in church and strengthened with what I had witnessed in my life. I had the internet, but I did not go to sites that would properly educate me on this stuff. It didn't interest me.

Then puberty REALLY hit.

It was all very traumatizing to me. I hadn't yet had my first menstrual cycle when my mom gave me what I thought was ""the talk""... and that was to show me what a period does. I was flustered and panicked. I had this notion in my head -- from watching TV and going to church -- that once puberty struck, I was going to lose control over everything in my life. I was going to become like all the other girls who couldn't stop fucking, drinking, or doing drugs. I did not want to grow up.

So it happened. I had my period. Hormones started running wild, but I had been aptly conditioned to deny sexual desires.

I also very much disliked the expectation that a Christian woman has to serve her husband. I hated wearing dresses. I hated being called a ""good girl"" whenever I cooked or cleaned (which I adamantly avoided to the point of being punished). I grew to hate playing with dolls because I saw -- after being best friends with a boy during my early years -- how boring it was. Baby dolls? No, give me dinosaurs and a toy gun. Let's go play cops and robbers.

Being a ""girl"" (in the Christian gender-role sense) was (and still is) something I never wanted to be.

I never wanted to date. I felt no attraction to anyone of any sex in my real life and when I did, the feelings were quickly extinguished when I learned how much of a ""pervert"" my crushes were. I avoided looking at pictures of men in lust because I thought it was ""disrespectful""... of course, the most natural route then was to... fantasize about women. It was much easier for me to look at women (seeing as how oversexed they were in the past and even still today in popular media) in a sexual way.

I was confused. Terribly confused and conflicted. I had a fear deep in the pit of my being that I was a lesbian because I found girl-on-girl [softcore] porn appealing. The fear went so deep that I started dreaming about homosexual acts with my female friends. Now, being a religious/superstitious type and very much into dream interpretation, I FEARED that this was God or Satan (I don't remember which I thought it was now) telling me I was a lesbian. I avoided friends at school because even though I didn't feel that same attraction in real life as I did in those dreams, I feared staying around them with those dreams floating in my head would TURN ME GAY.

By high school, I had become a terribly quiet person. I still had no idea of the joys of sex, only the pains and horrendous consequences. Health classes promoted this fear. The instructors were told to teach ""abstinence only"" during the curicculum. The students were forced to study the horrors of STDs and give presentations on each disease (to which the class-clowns presented the most horrific of photos Google could muster up for shock-value). We were forced to watch a documentary of a woman birthing a child.

Yeah, that pretty much scared me away even more.

Keep in mind during all of this time, I spent every night praying to God. I would cry myself to sleep on bad nights. I thought the pain I was feeling was because of sins I had committed, I didn't know what the truth of this pain truly was... I just figured I had committed sins. I reasoned with the feelings to find the ""sources"" of these feelings and begged for forgiveness. I'd go to church, feeling happy... because I was with a community I thought understood me. Keyword: THOUGHT.

My family left our first church (since moving) when our pastor had been butted out of his position due to inane, bullshit politics within said church out in the middle of bumfuck nowhere as if it actually mattered. We moved on to another one. None of my old friends tried to keep up with me and when I had read of them later (on Facebook and LiveJournal/Xanga), most of them had become the biggest of hypocrites (Christianity-wise) I had seen in my life. I was shocked and appalled. I experienced very much the “holier than thou” feelings, but I kept my mouth shut.

At the new church, I had no friends. Zero. The only person who acknowledged my existence was the Sunday school teacher, but that was as a student and not as a person. I tried my damnedest to make friends, but couldn't. They had their clique and it was the way they liked it. I was not allowed in even though Christianity is a religion of love and accepting people with open arms. I didn't understand it at all. I would go into the church service depressed and on the verge of tears. I took it out on the weekly pamphlets, drawing dinosaurs, monsters, Jesus riding a roller coaster. Art was pretty much my only way out of feeling completely alone and useless 24/7. And it blossomed. More on that later!

I had my first boyfriend in high school because everyone else around me (that I looked up to) had a significant other. I thought it would fix my problems (whatever I thought those were)... but it didn't. I got bored very quickly of the relationship. And ended it. I still feel a little hatred for myself for ending a relationship with someone because I was bored, but I'd rather have done that than dragged the guy on for so long because I thought I had to... I didn't even know what to do beyond that point. I was slowly losing my religion and eventually called myself mildly agnostic. I believed no more in the Christian faith as one of truth and love, but just a mask put over the face of a true God.

SO FAST FORWARD. I was 15 years old (almost 16) when I first and FINALLY figured out how to masturbate (sans penetration). It felt GOOD. Too good. I remember thinking ""THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN MISSING OUT ON?""... but as a God-fearing, still kinda-sorta-Christian girl, I knew that giving myself this pleasure was disgusting and evil. I had to avoid it. I had to. I couldn't do this. But, as a fucking HUMAN, I did it anyway. And I felt awful, terrible, disgusting, evil after every single time. I couldn't enjoy masturbation. It was like a burden more than a fun activity. I eventually stopped masturbating altogether except for probably once every three months or so...

Then the dreams started again. Sexual trauma likes to manifest itself in interesting ways while asleep. I felt like I was responsible for the things seen in dreams... and sometimes they scared the shit out of me... I had eventually conditioned myself to feel no emotional attachment to masturbation. It was an evil I had to keep in check and I got no enjoyment out of it.

So fast forward some more... first year in college. I got in with a bad crowd because – for once – I found one of the boys in that group of people attractive. I literally thought God was speaking to me through my lust that he was important because I literally feel NO ATTRACTION TO ANYONE except for like 0.000000000001% of the world's population. So I started dating him.

WORST. BOYFRIEND. EVER. He did very little to comfort me in my occasional paralyzing sadness (which I had grown to accept as part of my life) and treated me as an accessory more than a human being. Now, growing up Christian, I thought this was my proper place. I was trained into believing I was not on equal terms with a man and so could not fight against it.

I think now would be a proper place to say that this was not something that was openly, directly taught. It is something learned and subtly programmed. I was never told by another person “you are below your husband” or “women need to stay in the kitchen”. It was more of what I learned from my parents through example (my mother is a very meek woman), what my culture endorsed (girls play with dolls, boys play with trains), and how my friends and teachers perpetuated it.

Partway through the school year, I told my parents I needed to get out of there. I needed to come home and get a therapist. They made me wait out the rest of the year insistent that I might grow to like it and that I was homesick.

Eventually, the Worst Boyfriend Ever dumped me. He described to me that he did not have the time to dedicate any effort toward making me feel happy and it was not an action out of respect or dignity, no. He did it because I was making him look bad. It was a horrendous feeling. To be dumped because you make someone look bad. I was suicidal the following nights. My roommate and a new friend comforted me in what way they new how, but it did not work. I couldn't explain to them why, but eventually, I put on a face and pretended I was happy until I was alone in my bed, allowed the privacy to cry myself to sleep once more.

I slept a lot there...

I left that school and went to a community college. I had given up on trying to make new friends, but instead confided in one from high school who was going to the same school. I took classes with her, but the moment the class let out, she would dash off to her boyfriend and leave me alone. Great. In hindsight, I think that made me hate sex and relationships a little more.

This is turning into an autobiographical novel, so I'm going to skip a lot here... I went to a therapist, was diagnosed with chronic depression, was given medication, took the medication for a year, rekindled my love of art, and went to another college. I dropped my medication and learned how to cope with my crippling sadness. I had lost God and my faith entirely. I never wanted anything to do with Christianity ever again. In fact, I despise Easter and Christmas even as traditional, commercial holidays. Uggh.

ANYWAY, THERE at my new college, I met BEST BOYFRIEND EVER. Well, not there, but through OKCupid. By this point in my life (about two years ago), I had grown to accept that I was not a very social person and that being around other people made me anxious and upset. I can't explain it through anything other than experiences and attempts to fight against it leave me feeling suicidal. So the most inviting place was the recesses of the internet...

So BEST BOYFRIEND EVER and I got along just fine... until we took our clothes off. I expressed disdain. I couldn't bring myself to do anything more than oral sex (on him). Any contact on my genitals made me cringe in pain. Even with lube. I broke down crying on several occasions. But Best Boyfriend Ever was patient and we worked slowly. I was incredibly insecure in my lack of sex-drive but he was understanding. Now, when I was finally comfortable with the intimate contact, we attempted sex... And this is where it all goes downhill.

Oh sure, the dick goes in up to a point, until my body says “HOLY SHIT, WHAT IS THIS. NOTHING IS EVER SUPPOSED TO GO IN HERE. GET IT OUT.” PAAAAAAAIN. Like a sandpaper sausage made of razorblades and dipped in super concentrated lemon juice and salt. Even with a lot of lube. At first I thought it was in my head since I literally couldn't help but think how stupid and gross sex is from all of my previous “experiences” of “witnessing” what it does. I started steeping myself in sex and porn. I'm OKAY WITH IT NOW. But every time I try, my body says NOPE. NUH-UH. NOTHING GOING IN THERE. So... yeah... sure... oral and anal are perfectly fine and easy. No pain. Not even the first time with anal. But vaginal? NO.

I spent my whole life post-puberty thinking putting stuff in my vagina was the grossest thing I could ever do as a human being. I had never used a tampon until I was 21. I cannot physically reach orgasm with penetration from a sex toy.

So yes, a doctor visit is planned for the future and I am so thankful for my EVER SO PATIENT BOYFRIEND. I believe this is something I can get over, it's just going to take some time... and probably some medicine.

I just would like to say, DON'T EVER TEACH A CHILD THAT SEX IS EVIL. TALK TO YOUR CHILD ABOUT SEX AND HOW IT CAN BE AMAZING ALONG WITH BAD. TELL YOUR CHILD MASTURBATION IS OKAY. TELL YOUR CHILD FEELING LUST IS NATURAL. TELL YOUR CHILD TO BE -SAFE-.

**tl;dr – The MODERATE Christian dogma I was taught turned me into a sex-fearing nut. I got over the fear once becoming an atheist, but my body still thinks it's scary because GOD HATES IT WHEN YOU HAVE SEX FOR FUN AND NOT PROCREATION. Don't do this to your kids, please.**",,True,,t5_2soy6,1371054590.0,,,True,t3_1g7bm9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1g7bm9/how_christianity_almost_permanently_ruined_my/,

Look, I know that most atheists come from Christian backgrounds and lean more towards the Left, and I know that there seems to be a stupid trend among the Left to cozy up with Islam like it's some sort of new-age hippie religion of peace and love (which it isn't), but for fuck's sake, don't do this kind of shit. We exmuslims are fighting against a far more oppresive religion and a far more oppressive religious demographic, so it would be great that you people don't go around downplaying the threat and negative aspects of Islam with shitty ignorant answers like I've mentioned above.

EDIT: It seems about half of you people don't understand what I'm talking about.

Look, I understand that you're mostly Christians, and don't really feel anything about Islam. I know, I completely undertand that. But the next time somebody brings up a topic of criticism against Islam, be it in a forum or in IRL, don't downplay it by coming into the discussion with 'OH BUT CHRISTIANITY IS THE SAME' or 'OH BUT ALL RELIGIONS ARE THE SAME' or 'OH BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CRUSADES', or some other shit like that. It completely downplays the issue of Islam in a discussion SPECIFICALLY meant to discuss Islam by turning it into a discussion about something else.

Okay, look at it this way, remember back when Taylor Swift won that award, when suddenly Kanye West leaps up on the stage and interrupts her and says 'Imma really happy for you and imma let you finish'. Remember how big of an asshole he was? Don't be like that asshole. When people in a forum bring up criticism of Islam, don't be like fucking Kanye and go 'Imma really happy for you and imma let you finish, but Christianity is totally the same.' Sometimes I wish there was a device that lets me punch assholes like these through the internet.

EDIT: 

For example:

*Person 1:* Have you heard? Islamic Country X is putting people in jail simply for blasphemy!

The **appropriate** answer should be:

*Person 2:* Oh my, that is awful! Indeed Islam is a terrible and oppressive religion.

The **WRONG FUCKING ANSWER** would be:

*Person 2:* Oh, but Christians used to burn people at the stake!  

Notice that the difference between the first reply and the second reply is that the former stays on topic and doesn't divert attention from the issue, while the latter not only completely veers off topic, but diverts away attention from the issue? Don't be like this. Don't be this asshole.

EDIT: For fuck's sake, most of you **STILL** don't understand what I'm talking about. I'm not saying talking about one religion being worse than the other, I'm not talking about which religions atheist criticize and which they shouldn't, I'm not talking about the socio-political landscape of Islam and Christianity or whatever the you people are thinking. All I'm talking about is simply this:

The next time someone brings up any kind of criticism about Islam, it is rude and impolite to divert or dilute the issue at hand by stating things that veer or take away from the specific issue mentioned. Say that I bring into attention that a bunch of atheists in Pakistan are getting lynched by Islamists, what would you suppose the proper reply to that? Would it be 'oh my that's terrible, Islam is a terrible religion with very oppressive ideas'? Or would it be 'Oh those poor people, they were killed simply for blasphemy'? Or would it be 'I sure hope the Muslim moderates would stand up and answer for these atrocities'?

ALL of those are fine answers; since they DON'T VEER OFF FROM THE ISSUE. What you SHOULD NOT FUCKING DO is give asshole answers like 'Oh but Christians are killing witches in Africa too', or 'But other religions are far more oppresive', or 'But the Westboro Baptists are every bit as horrible'. See the difference? While the former replies stick with the subject and the issue at hand, the latter replies not only veers off from the subject at hand, but takes attention away from it or dilute the issue into one generalized blob.

Okay here's another example:

Person 1: Hey did you hear? The Westboro Baptists are going to picket fences around dead gay soldiers tomorrow.

The appropriate answer should be:

Person 2: Holy shit that is horrible! What's up with fundie Christians these days.

The ASSHOLE answer would be:

Person: Yeah, oh by the way Syrian rebels beheaded innocent civilians yesterday.

Now, tell me you want to punch that fucker in the face. I know you want to. Why? Because he is actively veering away from the issue at hand; replying by stating what a bunch of Syrian rebels did has absolutely no bearing at all to the issue that you presented, in fact it takes away attention from it and gives it to some other issue. This I see assholes do all the goddamn time whenever the question of criticizing Islam comes up; you have at least one dickwad or two chiming in, 'OH BUT CHRISTIANITY IS THE SAME' or 'OH BUT THE WESTBORO BAPTISTS ARE HORRIBLE TOO,' or some other asshole reply like that.

Holy shit, I can't believe I have to make 4 goddamn edits just explain this simple thing.

I want to say that to me this is healthy, it may not taste good but it is good for you. What I've learned here is that I must be open to explore the possibility that what I think I know and what is fact can differ but I can only bridge the gap if I understand that knowledge can come from places that are uncomfortable to roam into. Growth only comes from that discomfort. I can look past the hard shell of what was ingrained in me and get to the source of the issue if I can only learn to embrace the open arms of conversation with those I may not agree with. We cannot be divided in a quest for what truth is. I don't want to cover my eyes and ears and say youre wrong and Im right anymore. I wanted to understand that which some of you already do, but I wanted to take it a step further. I feel like we did. Even if I did not convert you or you, me, we can all agree that there is certainly something wrong with the way religion is being handled by extremist on any end of the spectrum. I encourage you to continue to be as open as you are and continue discourse because in all honesty, a lot of this is why we have certain debates in government and households. Once we get rid of an antiquated view of things we can move forward as a race. Im a black male in his 20's in my culture a lot of us embrace religion without actually thinking about its origin and how it plays a role in our lives. I dont want to make a blanket statement because blankets are for beds not our beliefs. There are all sorts of different ways to look at things, but one thing I truly believe is we are all in this together. I want to know why you think like you think and I want you to know that I was honest about what I thought and because of that I grew. Please understand that I am not offended but, thankful that you embraced my thoughts enough to analyze them and I took your analysis seriously. Continue to fight the good fight and maybe not in our lifetime but ahead we will achieve many great things that we now do not because of religious divide. Thank you all. Much respect and love.**

I feel conflicted. I understand how religion gets in the way of truth. I see it. Growing up I saw it. It was a very bad thing wrapped in good intention. However, I cannot place a connection between my idea of what God is and the religious institution. I think ""God"" a term used to identify a higher power, is more complex than what anybody makes that power seem. We haven't even grasped the vastness of universe let a lone, scratched the surface of how it all was created, if it was, or if what I perceive to be  higher power would even claim to have done so. Here's my thing though, I thank ""God"" and appreciate ""God"" I have a personal relationship with this higher power that speaks to me in my head. I feel it in my heart. Its my personal thing. I can't say its there in others and if they are better or worse off if it is or isn't. I just know its there. 

I can't fathom how it looks, what it smell like, how big or small it is, if it consist of matter... or whatever... and I just think that's a part of where the problem with religion lies. They take your personal inward battle in this universe, and try to illustrate what it is and who (as if it is a who) when to me no illustration is required. 

So here is my point. We know what we know, and we don't know what we don't know. The fight isn't against science, the fight isn't against the idea of God, the fight isn't against atheism, the fight should be against those that attempt to block a mans search for what drives him. I feel like the cause behind groups can kind of repel individualism but, its those that step out and dare to be different that blaze new paths. I see a lot of ""religion is stupid""... because religion can be. I see a lot of ""atheists are smug""... because atheist can be. Why isn't there more people that realize those generalizations can be made for each group of people? Why can't we as humans admit that we really don't know, but we are going to fight to find out. One way or the other. That's my question whats wrong with that thought process? Or am I trippin? (I'm asking the same thing to those that are religious as well)

I don't mean to offend anybody, but I wanted to have some intellectual discourse and this seems like the place I would find it. I am still learning and I asked from a standpoint of such. Thank you for reading.

&gt;***About his mother*** *""This isn't to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world's great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways —and not necessarily the best way — that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives.""*

Simply put: Black people aren't getting elected if they're not religious.

Visit [**/r/BlackAtheism**](/r/BlackAtheism) more and we discuss this in detail.

Quotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.

Don't forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg


He ""found"" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, theres a lot of black people there and you're not going to get famous there, as black man, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.

Grew up in extremely diverse settings, i'm sure having memories of madrasas allowed him to contrast that with the radical christianity in america....

Hes one of the smartest presidents, *on paper*, that we've ever had. Remember, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn't a massive hurdle in life.

Every chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals. 

He rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2, or even the possibly closet atheist that clinton was said to be. Faith is never a member of his team of decision makers.

When he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican. He left god out of the verbatim recitation of various historical [documents](http://theydontfoolme.com/118/three-years-in-a-row-obama-fails-to-thank-god-at-thanksgiving/) and [speeches](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/25/obama-god-thanksgiving-speech_n_1113295.html) and [9/11](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/11/fox-omits-the-facts-to-politicize-9-11/189827)

Hes not religious **At all.**

Every time he opens his mouth about christianity it sounds [forced as hell](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/obama-religious-quotes_n_1292116.html).
I'm not going to go into his politics or anything...but I think to call him a closet atheist, is not a far stretch at all. I know /r/atheism loves the ""wheres the evidence"" claim, but to be honest here. [Obama has had more secular groups at the white house than any other president](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/02/atheists-meet-with-white-house-officials/1) , a point verified by many fundie-right wingers; so i'm sure they'd be honest about feeling threatened. He only refers to religion during times of [tragedy](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/02/obama-on-faith-praying-for-egypt-gabby-giffordsand-for-patience-as-malia-goes-to-her-first-dance-wit/), mandatory events like [prayer breakfasts](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/obama-hosts-easter-prayer-breakfast-with-meditation-on-suffering/2012/04/04/gIQAhW7lvS_story.html)...or when hes [trolling the GOP like he recently basically said ""this is what jesus would do,""](http://money.cnn.com/2012/02/02/news/economy/obama_tax_rich_jesus/index.htm) to try and convince them to adopt his politics.

He trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a ""faith office"". On top of that, don't forget him trying to get catholics to pay for birth control...  [hes trolling catholic church hospitals these days](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/17/health/policy/obama-administration-says-birth-control-mandate-applies-to-religious-groups-that-insure-themselves.html). I'm certain that even slightly religious people would have more ""respect"" for people of faith and their autonomy. 

Obama has supported gay-rights [WHOLEHEARTEDLY](http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2007/12/11/the_obama_questionnaire/
) since 1996 AT LEAST

No one in politics or academia believes him; Even people with different views don't believe him:

[Chris Hitchens](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITsYUjv_aEA), [Richard Dawkins](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/richard-dawkins-barack-obama-probably-is-an-atheist-lincoln-kennedy-clinton-too/), [Ann Coulter](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/ann-coulter-on-the-other-obama-rumor-hes-not-muslim-hes-an-atheist/), [Lawrence Krauss](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Lk7gHEfK4), [Pat Buchanan](http://townhall.com/columnists/patbuchanan/2012/02/21/creators_oped/page/full/), [Franklin Graham](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/21/franklin-graham-questions-obama-romney-on-christian-faith/), [Pat Roberson](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/robertson-warns-of-looming-secular-atheist-dictatorship), [Bill Maher](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/01/13/bill_mahers_campaign_prediction_obama_will_come_out_as_an_atheist.html), [Penn Jillette](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJGxVeQw3SE&amp;feature=player_embedded) etc. All of them think hes faking it. Hardcore christians and hardcore atheists.

He also campaigned on getting religion out of hiring practices: http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20082217-503544.html

Now you want info on Jeremiah Wright? Obama probably only distantly knew the guy. He had to more than likely only show up for appearances to make him seem like he was in touch with the community. 

Here is a point we need to talk about... Jeremiah Wright was caught saying ""god damn america""...[but you really don't understand what he was getting at.](http://www.timwise.org/2008/03/of-national-lies-and-racial-amnesia-jeremiah-wright-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-truth/) He was saying how utterly fucked up this country has been to minorities. Its true. You can deny it all you want, but he was highlighting a truth, albeit emotionally. He just wanted to say that America should really recognize their ways if they want to embrace Obama. Its kinda that ""hey, they don't like me? well damn them!"" Jeremiah Wright is not racist. Not at all. But you have to remember the bias white/right-wing america feels to anyone who talks about [white priviledge](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3812249801848706206) or exposes their messed up of institutionalized racism, so of course the clip was crazy. [Obama had to throw him under the bus to move on](http://articles.cnn.com/2008-03-18/politics/obama.transcript_1_perfect-union-constitution-slavery?_s=PM:POLITICS).

Black churches are the greatest source of networking in most urban communities, especially if black leaders are known to attend. Its all a game. I know in ~~Atlanta~~ every major city with a sizable minority population that many times, elected black officials only show up to church in times of election or when they need community support. They adopt a church home only to show their relation to the community. Its all for show. They have to connect with the people some how. Thats what a ""representative"" (in his case Senator) does.


Name a president who says this in his inaugural speech: 

   &gt; *""We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and* ***nonbelievers.*** *We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth.""*

He's already the negro, kenyan, socialist, communist, anti christ, who hates America.

1361981201.0,673,self.TrueAtheism,19bzek,My parent's priest asked me why I was an atheist. Here was my response. Thoughts?,jeffreybaird,788,115,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/19bzek/my_parents_priest_asked_me_why_i_was_an_atheist/,"It started with me wanting to be a priest. I admired the work priests did as spiritual guides and general mentors. I had grown up reading about the saints, reading from the bible with my parents and getting a general sense of what it meant to be Catholic. However, I hadn't really delved in to theology or any real church doctrine.

So I spent some time reading the bible, histories of the church and the catechism a little more critically. The first thing the struck me was how Catholicism had been used throughout history to control citizens of various countries. The pope had often been more of a political figure than a spiritual one through much of the growth period of the church. Then there were the obvious things like the spanish inquisition and various witch burnings. ""Well,"" I thought, ""These are the works of men, not of god. The church persevered and all we can do is be better moving forward."" It did, however, make me look a little deeper. How could the teachings of a man who, by my reading, was one of the earliest humanists in recorded history be used to do such violence?

From there I started looking at the biblical justification for Transubstantiation. I found the evidence to be sparse. This, along with other, smaller, things (Gay marriage, pre-marital sex, priestly celibacy) that I couldn't reconcile with made me realize that I wasn't really catholic.

So, if I wasn't catholic, what was I? At first I was just christian. I decided to again dive into the bible. I realized that while I liked a lot of the bible, there was some I just couldn't really get my head around. The old testament, of course, gave me pause but I wasn't too worried about that. It was mainly the new testament that wasn't part of the gospels. I realized that it was the attempt to deify Jesus that I was struggling with, especially the works of the apostle Paul. Jesus, by my reading, was more of a Jewish dissenter than a messiah; A great philosopher and not a deity. I felt his message had been lessened by the messianic cult that surrounded him.

So now I was reaching a crisis of sorts. I was no longer a Christian. It took me a long time to admit this out-loud because of the social pressures that exist in our country surrounding religion. I began to call myself a deist. I believed in an active God and a creator. Essentially the god of Christianity without Christ.

Then I began reading the cases for/against God. I read Aquinas' proof for God and found various logical holes. I started to pose various questions to myself. Is it logical for a God to need to be worshiped? Does God help people who pray more than people who don't? If God creates us, knows everything about us and everything about the world he placed us in, does free will exist? Why has God never healed an amputee?

Those conclusions led me to believe that if there was a God, he was not involved in our day to day existence. I became satisfied with the idea of ""The Great Clockmaker.""

This held until I became interested in theoretical and astro physics. After some reading of some various scientists, most of whom were unconcerned with the idea of a God, I realized I was asking the wrong question. I was asking, ""Is there a God?"" This was irrelevant as one can't disprove the existence of an invisible being who has no direct influence on the world. Instead I needed to ask, ""Does there need to be a God for the universe to exist as we know it?"" The overwhelming consensus in the scientific community is no.

So this leads me to my current position. I don't make the claim that God does not exist, simply that God doesn't need to exist. Then, for me, the most reasonable conclusion is that God does not exist.

Sorry for the long message but the journey to where I am has been a long one.




EDIT: The priest responded. While I disagree with the conclusion he reached, you'll see why I respect him so much.

&gt; jeffreybaird,

&gt; I really was very interested in your journey and how carefully you have read and reflected upon the historical, philosophical and scientific aspects of this awesome and mysterious reality we live in. What is interesting to me too is how my studies have traveled in a parallel fashion to yours although with sometimes differing conclusions. I agree that much of church history is filled with many and too often gross transgressions against humankind - it's remarkable that the church has survived in spite of so much flawed humanity. I have also read much about the contemporary understandings of quantum physics and cosmology. In fact, astronomy is one of my avocations. I'm sure you have read about the anthropic principle of the universe and Stephen Hawking's response especially in his latest book The Grand Design. I've read that a number of astro-physicists feel that he is way beyond science in his hypotheses. I liked especially one physicist from England who said we are still only walking on the beach looking out into the ocean of what we don't know about the universe. I liked his humility. You know what is the game clincher for me though is direct experience of the presence of God - what modern theologians are referring to as mysticism. I've read about neurologists who will claim that experiences of transcendence are all in the brain, but there are a number of neurologists who are not so sure and even some who are believers in the reality of something beyond. I wonder if when you were studying you had someone with whom to bounce ideas around. I've found that having people like that challenges me and also makes me accountable. I hope you do.

I optimistically have a handful of years left, but really, if a spot of tumour were to spread to the right (wrong) place, I could have only months. 

So I'm asking what suggestions you have to hold a secular funeral. Especially on location. I would still be tempted to hold it in the church where I was baptised, because the building is magnificent and there is every facility needed while still giving privacy. I would however, request that no religious leaders or symbolism be present. I honestly believe that in my small community, this could be done. 

What alternatives do I have guys? And what can I do to make sure that after my death, the people I've left behind (both non-religious and heavily religious) will be comforted in the fact that I have not gone to heaven (or hell) but gone back to the nothing that I was pre-birth? Are there particular quotes that you admire? 

Any advice will be appreciated :)

Edit - Thankyou so much for all the suggestions and well wishes. I assure you, I'm making good use of my time here!

I may have given the wrong impression with the whole back to pre birth thing. It won't be a slap in the face to the religious there. I don't want it to be about pushing my views on people. I just don't want prayer and hymn singing and all that stuff, meanwhile, I would like some tasteful quotes about death that don't involve god. Which I think I may have found here!

I've decided that the first thing I need to do is sit down with my parents and talk with them about what they would want. That has to happen before anything else. Then maybe look into That church I mentioned, and then maybe onto a pub where the bar is paid for.

I've done this probably 30 times by now. It has always been good natured and interesting.

It's very simple, it's worked pretty well for me, and it allows me to remain open minded, gracious, and professional with them. And I use it as just a small way to help them experience empathy and have an ""aha!"" moment of atheism that isn't directed at their current beliefs. Which to me, is a great goal to have in terms of laying future foundations for rationality. 

1. First I say, very politely, ""Ok, guys, I have a few questions for you and I'll tell you exactly what you can do to have me believe as you do and attend your church. And it's very quick and simple. May I ask my questions?""  They always say yes. 

2. Then I ask them if they believe in Zeus--that he controls the lightening in the sky, is the father to the Gods, and that Mount Olympus is where they can go to see him?  They always say ""NO"", and general emphatically or with a bit of mocking/humor. I try to stay very sincere and doe eyed as I ask. 

3. Then I say, ""Ok, so is there anything I can do--at all--OTHER THAN some dramatic and life altering miracle, to make you believe in Zeus right  here on my porch? Is there anything in the world I could say to you or read to you that would make you believe he is the God of Lightening?"" 

4. They always say, ""No. There is nothing you can do to make me believe in Zeus on your porch, outside of some extremely dramatic miracle."" And I confirm it by saying, ""Ok, so you very atheistic on the topic of Zeus, and I cannot talk you into changing your mind about it, then"". They confirm, ""Nope."" 

5. ""Ok then,"" I tell them, ""You must know that, outside of some dramatic miracle or sign, right now, that there is nothing in the world you can tell me or read to me on my porch that will make me believe in your XYZ-insert-god-here (depending on the group in front of me). So talking will waste our time here. BUT! I am extremely open and willing to see if you have a major miracle or sign to show me, and I can tell you that if it happens here I will be in your church bright and early the next time the doors open."" 

This is where it gets good. I've had VERY few people try to keep talking and argue. Many ask questions here and there, but generally they have FELT empathy for my atheist position already and know it's not worth their time. I will also hear ""it is wrong to test God"", to which I answer that I'm not testing Him. He can do what he wants. It's only that there's nothing they can say on my porch to make me believe, and that's the only thing that could convince me otherwise. They know they're out of luck with me outside of a ""hail mary"" prayer pass.

But I have had a number of them ask if they can pray to see if God wants to ""show himself"" to me. And you know what, that is entertainment! I would LOVE to see a real sign from heaven! But I tell them I don't want to pray WITH them (if they pray they usually want to pray with/for me), but I tell them they can step back onto the sidewalk or walk in the yard and pray for the sign however they like. 

Some do. And they always leave with nothing having happened. Put some--especially high school aged kids--pray with amazing fervency. They really believe that it might happen. And there's something about that kind of faith that I appreciate, even if I don't believe it.  Generally I'll get some comment or another about ""perhaps God will speak to your heart"", and I generally reply, very sincerely and in a friendly way, ""and perhaps Zeus will speak to your heart as well."" And I know that as we part--so far, always in a friendly way--that we're both thinking the exact same thing: ""Yeah, right.""

Usually our differences don't affect our relationship, but last night we started talking about God and faith, and she told me she loves God more than me, and that she would have to put God before me. This really hurt, and then I asked here if I could ask her a tough question. I told her if she felt it was unfair of me to ask or if she needed time to think about it, that was ok. I then asked her if God told her to kill me, would she do it? And without hesitation, she said yes. My girlfriend would kill me out of faith in an invisible, highly improbable, and really not very great being: God. I could almost feel my love for her disappear. It just vanished. I realized this was insane, and it is the nail in the coffin for me on religion. If religion could convince a person as smart, and kind, and reasonable as her, that it would be ok to kill someone, then I want no part in religion. It scares the hell out of me that she said that. In a way I still love her, but I can't look at her the same now. Was this unfair of me to ask? I didn't know how she was going to answer, and it wasn't meant to be a gotcha question or anything. I was just curious. 

**UPDATE:** We ended up talking at a park nearby for almost 6 hours. In the end, we broke up, but interestingly, she asked me show her more of these contradictions and other problems I find with the Bible. I doubt I could ever make her atheist, but maybe she will be a little more open minded to atheism. She's never read the Bible all the way through. I am still working on it. But we have the same friend group and it is inevitable that I will see her, so maybe sometimes I'll bring up religion with her. I still love her. But I know I will get over her. All in all, I am happy, and I don't regret it. **ALSO TO MAKE THIS CLEAR** I did NOT break up with her just because of her answer last night. It was kind of a tipping point though.

Very few religious people use it in the philosophical sense of acknowledging it is impossible to disprove the existence of something you can't detect.

I just went to an atheist AA meeting.  I have to admit, I was a bit afraid that it might center around atheism rather than recovery.  But it was very pleasant.

Some differences between an AA and an atheist AA meeting is the opening and closing.  Instead of starting with prayers, we started with some positive affirmations.  Just good things to ponder and meditate on.  We read the 12 steps, but the references to God were swapped out for things that were more personal responsibility and community/group focused.  But the best part was the sharing:

Gone were the appeals to faith and the constant droning of ""how this program saved my life"".  Many AA meetings seem to share much in common with charismatic tent revivals.  More rhetoric than substance.  You would go and get your spiritual batteries recharged, which I felt was just an appeal to emotions than logical 'how to'.  

Since I live in the south, I'm in the bible belt.  So finding a group like this was rare.  Most of the folks were older than I thought they would be.  Everyone stayed after and just talked, catching up on each others life and issues.  Very supportive.  I know I'll be going back.

1373284107.0,434,self.TrueAtheism,1hux1i,I would love to see a creationist debate a bible scholar.,Rockfiend,538,104,242,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1hux1i/i_would_love_to_see_a_creationist_debate_a_bible/,"Td;lr:  I want to see a creationist debate a legitimate bible scholar because they speak the same ""language"".

My reasoning:  Okay, so lately I've been on a kick of watching videos of debates between evolutionists and creationists.  One thing that is really frustrating me (and to a lot of you, I imagine) is that no matter how learned the evolutionist is, the creationist never sees past their own presuppositions.  Sometimes someone like Richard Dawkins will say something that I, being a former creationist, recognize as irrefutable from that perspective.  I'm always a little surprised when the creationist doesn't just say ""That makes so much sense.  What have I been thinking!?!"" and just shake hands and join the ranks of evolutionists.  This never happens.

The last few days I have been analyzing why this is.  I have come to the conclusion that it is because an evolutionist and a creationist speak entirely different languages.  Evolutionists speak in terms of science and creationists speak in terms of the bible.  This is obvious.  Another thing is that evolutionists, while being knowledgeable in general of the bible, have not devoted their life to the bible and therefore a lot of times cannot discern if the creationists are interpreting a verse incorrectly or misquoting it or using it in the wrong context.  I have seen many videos where this happens—I myself have read a majority of the bible and can pick out when they are doing this, but they rarely get called out on it!  I think the solution is to find someone who speaks the same language as a creationist to be able to get through to them.  I think this person is a bible scholar.   If you don’t see why this is possible, hear me out.

When I was a creationist I took a few science classes, watched many science documentaries, visited science museums a lot.  None of them convinced me of evolution or even of the legitimacy of science because what I “knew” about the bible was more convincing:  it was the only sacred text that had prophesies that were always fulfilled, it was a perfect book that you could see with your eyes was inspired by god, there were signs of the apocalypse all around that were predicted in the bible (nothing is scarier than that to a creationist).  Fear was ruling me and I didn’t even realize it.  Then, I took two academic bible courses at my university.   Let me tell you, bible scholars know their shit.  In the first week of class they had dismantled everything that could possibly convince someone that the bible is infallible and written by god.  Before the end of the semester, my professor showed beyond a reasonable doubt that all the stories in the bible are folklore (we spent significant time on picking apart the creation stories, Noah’s flood story, Sodom and Gomorrah story).  In my old testament course, all of the prophesies were completely undermined.  The best part was that all of this was done within the context of the bible, history and culture of the ancient near east, and other literature.  There was nothing that could not be grasped by someone who does not understand science!  By the end of these courses, my faith had completely dissipated and I was an atheist.  To me, I had been shown evidence that there was no way possible that a Judeo-Christian god exists.   When that happened, all the science I had learned fell into place in my mind.  

I have talked to my professors many times and they would tell me stories of all the people that came to them emotional because they realized everything they had been taught in church was wrong.  I also found out that bible scholars can’t stand fundamentalists or creationists or cherry-pickers.  They can dominate on that turf because nothing is subjective to them about the bible—they don’t just sit there with a bible and “feel out” what everything means.  They know about the history, the culture, and the language of the people who wrote the bible and of the pagans who inspired them.  They know of the translational evolution of the bible including how minute details and words changed over time.  Someone without a degree who has just been emotionally reading the bible doesn’t stand a chance.  

Another thing I’ve noticed is that when I would tell my parents (fundies) about the science I was learning—it either went right over their head or it was immediately dismissed as irrelevant.  When I  started telling them about the stuff I was learning in my bible courses, it stopped them in their tracks.  I suddenly knew more about their bible than they did and they couldn’t argue with me.  I also hear people say all the time that the surest way to leave Christianity is to learn about the bible.  

The point is, I would love to see someone like Ray Comfort debate with someone like my bible professors.  I cannot imagine him getting away with the shenanigans he does in that scenario…Furthermore, I think I have figured out the surest way to get through to the creationists I come across.

We would expect news reporters to question them on other historical inaccuracies.""

- - -  

More and more wannabe fundamentalist Christians everywhere re-phrase the argument that the ""worst mass [murdering]"" leaders in history were atheist and conclude that their bad doings were solely motivated by not having any moral foundations due to the fact that they did not believe in any shenanigans.

In particular, they keep mentioning Hitler, Stalin, Mao and Pol Pot. Now, while it is true that Communism tried to evade any association with religion, following the original writing of Marx and as a perfectly sane conclusion of the ideology, it is debatable – if not pretty clear that all the communist leaders in the above list did not motivate their horrible acts against humanity under the flag of atheism.

What bothers me the most, though, is the **completely false** statement that hitler was an atheist and nazism is an atheist movement. Moreover, whenever I see the likes of Alex Jones and Bill O'Riley use this blatant lie in another pointless discussion about religious fundamentalist views, I keep getting annoyed that no one ever points out that the MERE fact that they keep reciting this false statement subverts their credibility and authority as a spokesperson on national television or radio.

Can't we finally get it straight that hitler did the **complete opposite**, and used Christianity as a banner for his rage against the Jewish people (stating their crimes against Jesus as one main factor). The NSDAP (the German nazi party) were also heavily opposed to Communism, one reason among others being their atheistic attitude and claimed that their disbelief in god is a threat to Germanist tribes. In their party program they also write: ""We demand freedom for all religious confessions in the state, insofar as they do not endanger its existence or conflict with the customs and moral sentiments of the Germanic race. The party as such represents the standpoint of a positive Christianity, without owing itself to a particular confession [...]""

Actually, it does not really matter if Hitler and the Nazis were Christian, or in any way religious, or even secretly Atheist. Their party program above as well as anything they state can be regarded as empty words to please the public, being populist and serving to the people what they want to be fed.

The **important** matter here is that they actually **used** (or misused) Christianity and **religion** to argue their way through the horrible acts they committed using a mixture of Christianity and Germanic mythology (nordic mythology) as legitimation. (FYI, I am *not* turning this around as an attack on Christianity or Religion. It similarly has nothing to do with the human misery of the Second World War. The acts of the Nazis cannot be compared to, say, the Inquisition as they misused Religion for their populist agenda with religious authority.)

How can this lie continue to exist, especially if it is clearly used as a **tool** to steer people who want to hear what they want to hear so they feel comfort in their belief system and believing they're doing the right thing. I cannot cope why this is still an argument, which should have been squashed to nothingness along WITH EVERYONE'S REPUTATION WHO USED IT BLINDLY HAVING A NAME IN PUBLIC BROADCASTING (Television: the glowing propaganda machine). AAARRRGHHH!!!

**TL;DR**: Nazis never stated they were Atheist and actually misused Christianity and Religion to legitimize their horrible actions (NOT atheism). How can we continue allow public figures to keep re-stating the blatantly false statement that the Nazis committed their crimes against humanity under the flag of Atheism and not squash their reputation for being ignorant, blindly throwing lies into the idiot public who does not know any better?

I gritted my teeth when his eulogy was edited to talk about Christ. And sat through the most hyper-religious funeral I've ever been to. Listened to nonstop nonsense about how he was making awesome barbecue and ""jamming"" with Jesus. How he was laughing at us for mourning because he's in such an awesome place now.

I led an (AWKWARD) prayer for my Alzheimer's-ridden grandmother who didn't know who I was or that the person who died was her son. I had a long theological discussion with my much-younger brother and asked him good questions and let him suss out his own faith while hiding my own agnosticism so that I wouldn't tamper with his journey.

I managed to not roll my eyes a single time where anyone else could see.

In the end, I wouldn't change a thing. For my father this was his comfort, how he dealt with his early death without fear. It's how his wife is dealing with her loss. This faith has formed the whole framework of their lives for decades before I was even born.

I don't understand this thing about ""coming out"". I only visit occasionally, and for them it would be devastating to know I didn't believe in any of this anymore. With the exception of that one prayer, which I led because everyone else was crying and I wanted to get it over with and not be a ten-minute-long sobbing fest, I just smiled and said nothing and everyone else was content to project onto me whatever suited them.

Which is what people do anyway, all the time. Don't we all assign motives to people based on our own feelings rather than what they are actually doing?

What is the best way to break the news to our friends?,leavingchurch,469,64,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/18h1zr/update_my_wife_and_i_are_leaving_our_longtime/,"[Here's the original post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/17kli8/my_wife_and_i_are_leaving_our_longtime_church/)

First of all, thanks for all of your comments and suggestions in the original post. 

Since it was difficult to schedule a face-to-face conversation with the adults but not the kids, my wife and I decided to just send an e-mail to our closest friends at church. We sent a separate e-mail to the pastor and parish administrative secretary. 

We have heard back from everyone. Most were surprised, but none seemed too upset. Every single person was supportive. They all said they would miss seeing us on Sunday mornings, but assured us that our friendships would remain and we would continue to see each other outside of church.

That has been the case. Since sending the e-mail, I've seen several of my friends outside of church. No one has mentioned anything about trying to get us back to church. Nothing has been awkward. Everyone has been totally supportive and respectful.

We have heard from others in the parish who heard through the grapevine that we were leaving, but did not know why. When they called to ask why we were leaving, everyone was surprised but supportive. Some have even admitted that they have doubts too, but can't leave because they feel part of a community. They understood our reasons for leaving, especially in light of the fact that we have young children.

I have heard that people in the Pacific Northwest are less religious than the rest of the country. I guess even the religious people are a bit more laid back up here.

**TLDR:** My wife and I told our friends we are leaving the church. Everything went better than expected.

I was recently engaged in [a discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1i2eni/evolution_vs_god/cb0f0pa) with a Christian who claimed that atheism was on the rise because of an increase in superficial teaching and a decrease in taking the bible seriously. 

Incredibly he could link me to some sources, so there are actually Christians who promote this idea! [Here](http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/06/listening-to-young-atheists-lessons-for-a-stronger-christianity/276584/) and [here](http://www.firstthings.com/article/2008/05/001-mainline-churches-the-real-reason-for-decline-8)

This started when I made the case that creationism (and specifically young earth creationism) are leading to a mass exodus of young Christians leaving the Christian faith and probably plays a large part in the growth we see in atheism today.

I decided to put this to the test and conducted a short informal poll of /r/atheism, /r/trueatheism, /r/deism and /r/freeatheism. This poll only really gained traction on /r/trueatheism.

I asked two big questions:

 - If you left the Christian faith, what was your greatest reason for doing so?

 - What do you consider to be the greatest obstacle to belief in the Christian God?

The results are now in and I maintain that Christian teachings that are in conflict with the findings of modern science are the major reason for the recent growth in atheism amongst young people in the developed world.

The results are available for download in both [xls](http://pastelink.me/dl/f43903) (contains some additional summaries) and [csv](http://pastelink.me/dl/14fb2a) (for those without MS Excel)

 - 2020 people took part

 - Of those 86 were Christians and 1934 were Non-Christians (95.74%)

 - The majority of the respondents were Christians at one point (73.71%)

In the xls document, I look at the difference in responses between those who left Christianity, those who were never Christians and those who currently are Christians. For those who would like to verify these, the online link to the results is available [here](http://cynicalme.questionform.com/statistics/Obstacles-to-belief-in-Christianity/report).

*Disclaimer*: This survey did receive a lot of criticism from /r/atheism for not asking the right questions, but then again so does just about any post. There were ""Other"" options for the two big questions where they could fill in their own views. I have published these as well if anybody would like to sift through them and sort them into appropriate categories.

What I have found to be particularly interesting is the massive disconnect between popular Christian perceptions of the obstacles to belief and what atheists actually have to say about this matter for themselves.

Of particular interest is the large number of Christians (30%) who think this has to do with superficial teaching and not taking the bible seriously enough, compared to a mere 2.5% of non-Christians who at one point left Christianity giving this as their greatest reason for leaving and 1.7% of those who were never Christians stating this as their greatest obstacle.

It seems clear from this survey that the popular dispute between some forms of Christianity and main stream science has been a large contributor to the decline in the faith. 

Finally I want to congratulate those Christian traditions who do not try to suppress science, promote ""experts"" who claim to know better or indoctrinate their children with ""alternate science"" and instead find ways to avoid the conflict between Christianity and mainstream science by considering the two to be addressing different questions.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1j7lup,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1j7lup/the_results_of_the_survey_are_in_reasons_for_the/,

Before I ask the question, I preface it with two requirements.  First, I refuse to believe in something ""because i said so"".  If I accept one religion on faith because you say so, I have to accept all religions on faith, and most religions are mutually exclusive.  That means I must be able to test for myself to find out the truth.

Second, I refuse to accept any arguments that assume that the belief is true, then use that assumption to prove that the belief is true (""begging the question"").  If you start with the assumption that you're already correct, you can go on to prove anything.

So far I haven't been able to find a single person who can answer the question.  At the beginning of the conversation they will usually start talking a lot about their beliefs, but they don't even try to answer the  question until I interrupt them and bring them back to the question at hand.  
Several times.  
I'm not sure why that is, but it's a pattern I've noticed.  

Some people aren't sure what I'm asking, so I use the example of the theory of gravity.  The theory states that if I drop an object, it will fall towards the ground at 9.8 meters per second squared, minus the effects of air resistance.  That's easily testable.  Drop an object, time it, and do the math.  
If the object were to, for example, hover above the ground, or jump out of my hand and fly sideways, that would be an indicator that the theory might be incorrect.  The theory could be FALSIFIED.  If the theory were wrong, anybody could perform a simple test to find out for themselves.

Note that this question only hooks people who are trying to convert you.  When I talked to a religious person who WASN'T trying to convert me, the conversation mostly collapsed into ""I believe it because it makes me happy"", which is a perfectly legitimate reason to believe something.  

**EDIT**: Oh, for fuck's sake, people.  If somebody wants to believe something because it makes them happy, I'm not going to try to change their minds.  It may be illogical or it may not be, but it's not worth my time or effort to try to change their minds.

Our household isn't a religious one.

Well, I guess she's decided. She's not being the nice, accepting kind of Christian, either. She's being the kind that believes abortion should be illegal by any means necessary, and that it should be illegal to take someone off life-support, even if it means millions of dollars in medical costs to the family of the person (a la Terri Schiavo).

There is sooooooo much hypocrisy in her boyfriend's family with regards to their ""Christian faith"". I mean, I know hypocrisy is inherent with Christianity, but these folks take it to a new level. I guess, however, that even slight hypocrisy is still a compromise of religious doctrinal adherence, so I guess that doesn't matter too much.

Thank you all for all the thoughtful responses. I'm reading through them now.**



I am completely unable to figure out what to do.


I am the husband and father in a Modern-Orthodox Jewish family. I am fairly certain there is no God, or at least that if there is a God, this God has given us no reason to believe in his existence and certainly not enough evidence to point us towards one religion or mode of worship over another. If there is a God, I don't see how anyone could rationally be expected to extrapolate his existence (and certainly not his desires) from anything made available to us.


My next steps are not so clear. There is no element of my life that would not be affected negatively by making it clear (to pretty much anyone beyond my wife and some close friends) that I believe that my family’s world-defining belief is nonsense. The lives of my wife and children will be enormously affected by something like this. Their entire world is constructed around this. Their friends, their school, our extended family, etc. This world is not a bad world. There are some issues, like treatment of gender roles and sexuality with which my wife and I take issue and we have always made sure my thoughts are known to my children.


My wife basically knows how I feel. She has much closer ties to the community that I have and I’m particularly sensitive to not messing up her life more than I already have (I have multiple chronic illnesses, physical and mental, that she already puts up with).


But was is the cost of continuing to allow my children to believe in a god and Orthodox Judaism in particular? What is my obligation to them? Do I have a right to let them believe in nonsense because it might make their lives easier, or at least simpler? Do I allow them to continue as-is, and just make sure to constantly encourage critical thinking? Am I setting up a time bomb by leading them in a direction that will probably wind up with quite a bit of dissonance in their lives? Is this different than the fact that I know their history textbooks will also be full of crap? 


I definitely don’t think I should lie to them, but don’t I have some obligation to encourage thinking that will lead them to question the foundations of their worlds?


There are a lot of benefits to being in an Orthodox community, and how would potentially tearing these away from my family hurt them? What can I possibly offer to take its place?


Overall, I do not dislike our community. There are times when I wish my world was a bit larger, but I don’t hate the people around me. I find some of the things they say or believe off-putting, but I don’t think that present here in a greater extent than in the population at large. In general, (and certainly the people we consider friends) our contemporaries are thoughtful, generous, and open minded. The secular education they receive is top-notch, and far better than the options available in the public school system. This is in fact an area that is pretty important to my wife and she wants them to stay in a private school.


Anyway, I’m at a loss. Do I go along to get along, while dropping critical-thinking breadcrumbs and keeping my beliefs to myself until I’m explicitly asked? My current thinking is that my kids are young enough that they can remain blissfully ignorant for a while longer (12, 9, 6) and that it would be cruel to mess up my wife’s life any more.


Sorry for the rambling. This has been rattling around in my head, and there is almost no one with whom I can explore this fully, at least not until I get my feelings straight. Thanks for any help you can give me in organizing my thinking.

I'm an atheist.,Blankstamped,447,82,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/19y3x9/my_dad_is_a_street_preacher_my_brother_is_a/,"  So the title lays it out. My entire family preach and try to ""save"" people. I'm an atheist student, engaged to another atheist student, trying to get my life straightened out and get a degree, and find the money to get married. I was homeschooled my entire life, and lived in a series of renovated schoolbus...ses? si? I have also lived in barns, tents and partially constructed cabins. 

So a few days ago, my dad makes the 45 minute drive to where I live to tell me that he doesn't agree with me getting married until I ""get right with God"". In passing, he mentions that he may not show up to the wedding if there are lesbians or male homosexuals there (there will be several of both), asks if it's alright if he ""doesn't dress up"", and  comments on the way my fiance and I might raise our future children.

I'm very polite.

Today he sends me the little ""definition of atheism"" picture that makes the rounds on /r/Christianity every few weeks. You know- ""nothing happened to nothing and then nothing exploded..."". He says ""I thought this was a good description of Atheism. Love Dad""

So I sent him this:

Atheism is the lack of belief in a deity. There may be other beliefs that follow from that, but that is all that atheism is. More specifically, I'm an agnostic atheist, which means that I don't believe that I can prove that a god doesn't exist, the same way I can't prove that ghosts don't exist.That is the definition of atheism. So, your picture here. I've seen it before and I'll try to keep this short.

First, I have never seen, or experienced nothing, because no matter where you go in the universe, there is something, because space itself is made up of something. By definition, nothing is something we can't interact with or see or experiment on. Which means that for all intents and purposes, it doesn't exist.

Secondly, I don't believe much of anything about the beginning of the universe. I don't know. But I'm of the opinion that a god is a needlessly complicated explanation which immediately gives rise to thousands of other questions. Questions like 
""well, what created god?"", 
""if he has always existed, then why can't the universe have always existed?"", 
""If he is 'outside of time' or something of the sort, how do you know that is even possible?"", 
and ""We have never found any way that any animal or person could exist without a physical body. If you damage the mind, the personality, thought process and memories of the person can be altered. This gives the impression that there is no 'non-physical' component to a person. There is no 'spirit'. Memories require storage space. An immortal, omniscient being would require infinite physical storage space. Where is it?"" 

Whereas ""I don't know."" Is a perfectly reasonable response. I don't have to know how the universe began to know that there are flaws in the creator hypothesis. 

Third, evolution says absolutely nothing about how life arose from inorganic matter. This picture doesn't make any distinction between ""life coming from non-living matter"" and evolution, which is (from what I understand) only concerned with genetic change over time in a pre-existing population. There are lots of studies and experimentation having to do with abiogenesis, which is the ""life from non-life"" bit, and most of it is over my head. Also, I don't have to be a biologist to realize that ""God did it"" just raises hundreds of new questions, like:

""How did he do it?""
""What processes did he use?""
""How did he turn dirt into a man, and why did he need to, if he can just make him appear?""
""Why did he need a rib to make a woman?""
""If he can make matter appear (and disappear) at will, why does the bible have hundreds of instances where he destroys things with fire and flood?""
""How do you know it was your god who made the universe, and not one of the 28,000,000 other gods? Sorry, ~27,999,999.""

Fourth, evolution is well supported by evidence. A lot of evidence. Go to this site- TalkOrigins and look around. It has a lot of interesting stuff if you can suffer through the boring parts. Here's the frontpage. 

So I've spent a lot of time thinking about this. I've debated it with myself and others, I've read more than I ever thought I would about all sorts of things. I didn't decide there wasn't a god over night, or to spite you and mom. I know that not believing in a god is a slap in the face to most believers, because it's like I'm calling them (and you, I suppose) a liar or an idiot just by saying that I don't believe. I don't mean it that way, and you are neither a liar nor an idiot. I just think you're mistaken. So now that I've over-responded to a little picture, here's a good quotation.

“Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.”
- Marcus Aurelius

And now my heart is going double time. I feel as if he might disown me. I want to be able to see my family. I want to be able to see my nephews. I probably shouldn't have sent that email.

I was made aware of this by a friend who works as Corrections Officer (prison guard), who says prisoners change their religion often, purely for the special kosher or halaal diets.  Usually changing again to avoid the fasting months.  Here is a link that talks about it

I also have no sense of smell. I have no problem telling people this, so they do not keep saying “smell this” and I don’t have to pretend to do it. I remember what it was like when I pretended as a child because I thought I was defective and just couldn’t figure out how to smell. I tried to memorize what faces went with what smells (roses were nostalgic and good, pizza made you hungry, poop was bad, dirty, mossy, creek water was bad for my mother but good for my friends, and limburger was….oh crap, it smells bad but tastes good…now what??)

  I remember how I tried to tell my parents and they did not believe me. I remember how relieved I was after picking up the limburger, sniffing it, and just telling everyone I don’t get it-it ‘smells’ like everything else.... that people just believed me and everyone just accepted I couldn’t smell with no judgements. 

People still hand things to me and say ‘smell this”…then I give them a look and they say “oh crap, sorry!” and we all laugh. It just isn’t a big deal. I don’t talk them out of smelling, they don’t talk me into trying. 

I think that if I could just openly say “I don’t believe there is a god”…. I would feel less resentful about religion. If when people bring up prayers or wax poetic about heaven I didn’t get this sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach that I just do not buy it yet cannot let that be known….. I might be more accepting. I have to nod during discussions, listen to debates based on religious reasons, go to weddings and funerals where I am expected to do all the things which accompany religious belief or I am questioned. 
 
It is the implied reasoning that I am defective, amoral, or going to go to hell for atheism that I resent. I would never tell someone who loves a god that they are wrong. I could certainly just live and let live with most religious people. It is that they cannot do the same for me that I resent. 

I met up with a fellow Redditor in Sydney a few weeks ago on my vacation. We had an awesome time hanging out in the botanical gardens for the afternoon (after I botched an attempt at a motorcycle ride). Religion came up and I was able to just tell him I was an atheist.  He was too. It just wasn’t a big deal, and he couldn’t fathom how it would be. I really appreciated that I did not have to hide it. It really made me think about the status quo here in the states. 

So it isn’t that I hate religion for being religion. I don't resent or think badly of someone else because they believe.  I resent religion for creating an atmosphere where I have to risk my relationships with people I care about in order to be honest about my own beliefs.

My wife has been a christian believer her entire life. She's more tolerant than most believers I know about other points-of-view or ways of life (homosexuality, etc.). But she still believes that if you're not saved and believe, through faith, that Jesus is your Lord and Savior, you're going to Hell.

I was right there with her, until about 10 months ago.

For anyone else that has been in the situation, you know what the problems are:

- She thinks I've just lost my way, and that a refocusing on God and Scripture will 'solve my problem.'

- She feels betrayed, and lied to, since I felt one way about a fundamental part of life, our live's, before we got married and now I no longer feel that way.

- How do we raise our daughter, and another on the way, in a 'house divided', if I don't come around.

And so many more. 

So, I turn to you Reddit. My closest RL friends say to suck it up, go to church, and play the part, keep the peace. I love her so much, and don't want to ruin things, but this sounds like terrible advice.

Is there a resource I can turn to, something I can show her, that helps her understand that our marriage doesn't have to end because of this? Or... is it already over?

I'm truly distraught about all of this, and I'm just not smart enough to wrap my head around this issue.

Thanks to anyone who might offer help. I love my family, and I just want to do right by them.

PS. Throw-away acct. because I have friends that know my actually handle, and I'd rather not put this out there for all them to see.

**EDIT:** Y'all have been so incredibly helpful, thank you so much. For anyone wondering someone below asked about my deconversion, and the long and short is, slow deconversion, over a few years. But I still get testimony thrown back at me, cause I'm turning my back on the God that healed me. Full story in the comments.

1361282879.0,347,self.TrueAtheism,18tg5x,A short compilation of theists' most popular arguments + their rebuttals,Phoenixed,412,65,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/18tg5x/a_short_compilation_of_theists_most_popular/,"**MORALITY**

*“Without God we couldn’t tell right from wrong, anything could be acceptable.”*

- The are/were plenty moral of people who aren’t/weren’t religious, because morality comes not from gods, but from the rational mind. The moment I state that murder (lie, theft, rape) is OK, I subject myself to it. It’s better for everyone not to do it.
- “Did the Jews behave like animals before getting Ten Commandments?”
- “Would you *agree* to kill me or your child if god told you to? ‘No’ - You know better than god. ‘Yes’ - You’re a psychopath. *[proceed to GTFO from there]*

&gt; **Expected “counter-arguments”:** *”Non-Christians can also act good, because all people have a spirit of (Christian) God inside them. / The biggest killers on earth were atheists. / God tests the ones He loves.”*

***
**MENTAL GYMNASTICS**

*”You can’t prove that God doesn’t exist. / God is beyond our understanding. / You must believe in order to see God. / God’s existence is self-evident. / God showed me a miracle. / I experience God personally. / This many people can’t be wrong about God. / Every culture has a God. / That important person believes in God.”* etc.

- Replace “God” with “Flying Spaghetti Monster” or anything else.

&gt; *”But Christianity has Jesus, Bible, apostles, prophets, saints, miracles, relics (Shroud of Turin) etc. / Since God isn’t disprovable, atheists are just as strong believers as Christians.“* 

***
**GENESIS (THE LAST GAP)**

*”Without God, where did everything come from?”*

- Science has working theories that make sense. But they aren’t provable yet, due to lack of technology. Still, science’s understanding grows every day and is being backed up by evidence and logic. While all of religion’s knowledge comes from a bronze-age book that was written by semi-literate, superstitious desert nomads. And throughout history, not once religion has proven science wrong. In fact it always was the opposite, like recently with evolution.
- “Where did the god come from? Or if he existed forever, how long did he wait before creating universe?”

&gt; *”Something can’t come from nothing. / Laws our world don’t apply to God. / Science can’t answer WHY - it should stay within it’s competence.” / ”Scientists eventually find that there’s some force holding everything together. / Some mysteries of the universe will never be answered because that’s how God intended. / Curiosity leads to knowledge, knowledge leads to pride, and pride is the greatest of sin (Tree of Knowledge).”*

***
**ORDER, PURPOSE, BEAUTY, COMPLEXITY**

*”Rivers resemble veins resemble branches resemble lightning; macrocosmos resemble microcosmos - that can’t happen by chance. / Without a creator, life becomes a meaningless coincidence, with reproduction being it’s only purpose.*”

- What can be asserted without evidence, can be dismissed without evidence. Also beauty and complexity are subjective. One depends on a personal taste, other - on intellect’s relative capacity.
- Accidental and purposeless universe doesn’t change anything, because life’s meaning is in pursuit of happiness using your rational mind and not in the following of given orders.
- There’s plenty of happy atheists creating great things.

&gt; *”All achievements are God’s gifts. / Why do you turn your back to the loving God who has done so much for you?”*

***
**PASCAL’S WAGER**

*”If you don’t believe in God and he exists, you’ll be in trouble. While if you believe and there’s no God, you lose nothing.”*

- This would mean god prefers fake allegiance over genuine goodness and blind faith over rational choice. Thus making him immoral and/or not omniscient.
- We can’t know that supposed god is Jahweh and not Allah/Zeus/Thor/etc. who have different commandments.

&gt; *”There are no atheists in foxholes. / Later on, when you’ll be old and weak, you’ll change your mind.”*

***
**PRAYER**

*”I ask for things and God always answers. / One time this lady prayed very hard for her cancer to disappear and it did!”*

- Prayer has yet to be proved to work. Even by believers.
- If god has a plan, prayer would interfere with it. So either he doesn’t have one or his mind can be changed.
- Since god is omniscient, he knows what you are going to ask and what you actually need before you even pray. This means either prayer is useless or god is formality-concerned bureaucrat.
- “What happens if farmers pray for rain and tourists in the same area pray for the sun?”

&gt; *”God doesn’t let himself to be tested. / You have to believe for prayer to work and it has to be genuine. / God works in mysterious ways.”*

***
All this should be used just for “self-defense”. Don’t expect to de-convert anyone, especially *people who became believers in adulthood*. It’s basically impossible, since *their* belief usually begins not with rational arguments or indoctrination, but with powerful emotional experiences in a period of huge and/or prolonged stress, when mind is the weakest. Belief, that is: friendly accepting community, imaginary all-powerful mentors, removal of responsibility, role in a cosmic battle between good and evil, promise of a happy future etc. alleviated that suffering. No amount of evidence or reason can make them change their minds since it’s more “economical” for them to create one more logic roundabout than to face their weaknesses and deep, fundamental fears about reality. Although if it’s your young sibling or friend, you could get brave and try.

1357676179.0,342,self.TrueAtheism,1679v4,The true cost of religion; the death of my grandmother and how I lost my faith,PixyFreakingSticks,416,74,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1679v4/the_true_cost_of_religion_the_death_of_my/,"Three years ago, my grandmother died. It was her religion that killed her.

She was the kind of grandmother that everybody loved, the kind you'd see on an old sitcom from the '50s. Sweet, always smiling, baking cookies and giving hugs and kisses on Christmas.

I loved her. A lot.

My grandfather believes the Bible is the word of God. So did she. They believe the parts that we don't understand (like how could it be fair that children had been starving to death in Africa, and died never knowing about Jesus) is part of the point. It's God's word, after all. How can we understand it? The Bible says that Satan the deceiver deliberately clouds your judgement. He doesn't want you to believe. Because when you believe in the ""truth,"" and grow in God's power, you become a threat.

Those are the people he targets first.

It's all wrapped up in a mystery, and it's like that on purpose. Faith isn't supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be hard. And if you're not struggling with it every day, you're doing something wrong. ""This is bullshit,"" he said to me once, my eyes going wide at him for cursing in front of me. ""You can't read the Bible and think that it's not. That's why it's so hard. That's where the struggle comes from.""

It made sense, somehow. And for a long time, I believed that too. It doesn't make any sense because it *can't* make sense, and it never will, no matter how hard you struggle with it. All you can do is have faith and press on. And one day, when ""the old man is put off,"" and we're *really* reborn as true Christians, with a new heart capable of love and a mind capable of seeing the truth, then we'll understand. Because spiritual truths aren't like carnal truths. You can not expect to understand spiritual truths with a carnal mind.

That isn't all he had faith in.

""The works that I do shall you do also,"" Jesus said. My grandfather knew what it meant. Jesus healed the sick, caused fig trees to throw themselves into the ocean, and walked on water. He bent the laws of nature to his whim; to *God's* whim. Jesus eased pain and suffering, and replaced those things with peace and love. That's what Christians were supposed to be doing, according to my grandfather; healing the sick with God's power; causing prosperity with God's power; creating heaven on earth with God's power. It's a beautiful dream, isn't it?

But the power to do this is not given away freely. No, it takes years of patience, perseverance and edification. You have to change yourself — *sanctify* yourself — from a person filled with hate and greed and malice to a person filled with love and nothing else. Put off the old man, destroy the old way, and be resurrected, born again, a new person in Jesus Christ. This is how you become worthy of wielding the power of God. This is what it means to be ""perfect."" This is what it means to be Christ.

""A noble goal,"" I thought when I was growing up with that idea. And it really was. You've never in your life met a more loving, caring, awesome person to be around. My grandfather is a saint, who just wants to help make the world a brighter place.

That is, until the day my grandmother became suddenly very ill. It was bad, the sickest she had ever been. We all tried to wait it out at first, together, praying every night, my grandfather first among us. But each day it got worse. Each day she got a little thinner. Each day, her smile got a little smaller. My grandfather's faith deserted him.

""Let me take you to a hospital,"" he urged. She didn't. She wouldn't. God was on her side, and she knew it in her heart of hearts. My grandfather was the one who had taught her that, after all. Emboldened by his wife's dedication, he relented and agreed, and stayed by her side.

But it kept getting worse.

Soon, she couldn't speak or walk. I didn't know what was going on. God was supposed to heal her. Surely, no one was more devout, more loving, more deserving of a miracle than my grandparents. And yet she was dying. This was a test of our faith, my family decided, like Abraham. So we did nothing but pray as we watched her waste away.

I was so upset that I didn't know what to do, so I went for a walk one night, out on the back country roads that wind through the hilly farms outside my home town. I remember that it was a warm autumn evening with all the city lights from the neighboring towns glowing pink and orange like a sunset on the clouds, but you could still see the stars. It was quiet and breezy and peaceful. And beautiful.

It was a perfect time for an argument with God.

All I wanted was for things to be normal again. I wanted to see my grandparents laughing together again. I wanted to see my mother and uncle not sick with worry. I wanted my *family* back. So I asked him to remind me that miracles do happen, and that prayers *are* answered. I wanted him to remind me that He *was* real, and that he really did send his only son to die for our sins, to be our savior, to give us the power to perform the miracles he did; to win the war between good and evil. Because for the first time in a long time, I wondered if God really cared at all.

""Why is this happening?"" I asked him. ""Why won't you answer me?"" All I wanted was a sign, a tiny one, something that he was out there, watching my family, caring about us. A feeling would do. ""Just give the the slightest reason to keep believing in you.""

And that's when it struck me.

I no longer meant ""believe in you"" the way you might believe in yourself, or believe in your husband, or believe in the system. No, I meant ""believe in you"" as in ""believe that you exist at all."" And that was terrifying. I had never felt such a thing before. My stomach turned in knots, and I felt like I wanted to be sick. I feel on my knees and sobbed, begging God to give me some indication that this was real. Give me, I asked of him, that comfort in knowing that there's a plan, that there's hope, that there's justice. That ""good"" really does exist, and isn't just an invention of man.

At that moment the wind began to blow. It was soft and warm as it whispered through the trees. The clouds had cleared, I noticed, and the brightness of the full moon was shining down on me. I stopped crying as an indescribable feeling came over me. It was beautiful, surreal, comforting.

""He's speaking to me."" My prayers had been answered! God was *speaking* to me. I knew it! I knew he was there. My grandmother was going to be okay! I begged forgiveness for having doubted my faith, and promised that I never would again. I cried again, but this time, because I had seen the beauty and glory and perfection of God in that brief, surreal moment.

I went to school the next day feeling that the world was a little bit brighter.

When I came home, an ambulance was parked beside my house.

She had died early that afternoon, laying in my grandfather's arms.

They had believed so deeply that God's power would heal her. Everyone in my family did. Everyone had prayed every night. We did all we could, and she died anyway.

There was no way to explain this. How could I have felt what I felt, and yet she still died? He promised me. Didn't he? God told me that night that everything would be okay. I *felt* that.

For a long time, I was numb, unable to accept what had happened. I talked with God many times after that day, asking him over and over again what I had done wrong. What had *she* done wrong that he felt the need to take her from us before her time? Was her life really worth taking just to prove a point? Slowly, I began to realize that I wasn't talking to God.

I was talking to myself.

Sometimes, people ask what the harm in religion is. Why does it matter, they ask, if you are willing to believe important things on bad evidence? Yes, bad things do happen sometimes, but you *probably* won't end up like my grandmother, who believed with all her heart that God would heal her. You *probably* won't end up like my family, who is, to this day, so rattled by the experience that you could hardly call us a family any more.

But if you're willing to believe that Christ walked on water, why aren't you willing to believe that prayer heals people? Where does it stop?

It doesn't. The religious that don't get dragged into something like this are the lucky ones, and it is only reason that keeps you from it.

That is the true cost of religion; the true cost of being unreasonable.

My mom's friend kept saying that her heart would be absolutely broken if her daughter told her she was atheist, how her father would be heartbroken if she was, and how she couldn't get by without God.  I said if God helps her, then that is great and I am glad she has that for herself, but she seemed so bothered that I couldn't do the same, and that she pitied people who didn't have God.

So the conversation goes on and I'm still not letting these things get to me, and she keeps dismissing all my attempts to say that it shouldn't bother someone else what makes me feel right, saying that I wouldn't understand until I was a mother.  She tries to make a comparison by asking me what I would feel if my hypothetical daughter told me she believed in God.  I said I'd be nothing but supportive of whatever faith made her happy.  She didn't seem to believe me, and later asked ""What would you do if your daughter told you she was a prostitute"".  I was absolutely stunned that she was trying to say that me telling my mother was relateable to telling her I was a *prostitute*.  I explained that it was completely different, because the reason I would be upset by my daughter being a prostitute is the risk of STDs, pregnancy, abuse, all of that.  Again, this was dismissed by me not understanding because I wasn't a mother.

I was left frustrated and hurt, because despite both of them knowing me for a long time, apparently being atheist put me in a category of close-minded, bitter, and judgmental people (these are all things that were said about atheists throughout the conversation).  I feel like I shouldn't have had to defend my character because of my beliefs, but I did.  To my own mother and a close friend.  And worse, apparently being atheist breaks a mother's heart the way a life of prostitution could.

So I guess this got very personal, but basically I just realized how hard it is for anyone who believes in god to understand my perception, and I am wondering how to deal with it.  I felt like the arguments weren't even lining up with each other, and we didn't leave with any sort of understanding.  Is there any way to get to a point where she, even if she disagrees, can respect my belief and not be ""fine"" with it only because ""there's no way to change [my] mind anyway""?  Maybe the answer is there's not, but that's a hard pill to swallow.

Well I live in KSA, the country where I can lose my head for the belief I held. Basically my story begins by arguing with my *Biology* teacher about the validity of evolution, him being a hardcore creationist. Only 3 boys in my class take this subject and one wasn't really 'the study type' I convinced the other about it and eventually we went head on with our teacher who was furious I 'converted' him into accepting evolution. 

We actually thought this was hilarious and  made the following statement,' I believe there is no other more plausible explaination for the diversity of life on earth beside natural selection, and I believe darwin was it's messenger' 

We thought that was quite clever, anyways, for me there wasn't any contradiction with Islam and evolution to begin with, but as I scoured the internet, I found myself losing faith, until I woke up one morning as an Athiest, but it's a hard thing to lose your faith, so sometimes I woke up as a Muslim, I was depressed for so long, alienated my family, who pretty much figured out what I was going through, but here's the kicker - they did not once try to come to force belief onto me, just some statements,'you know if you have any questions regarding Islam I can hope to answer them' Which was funny since I was most of the time answering theirs!

Anyway, months went by and I eventually had to make a lot of compromises and I got my belief again. I support the right of freesom of speech, the freedom FROM religion and LGBT rights.

The main part of the story was that last month, while talking to a creationist, my friend came out to me as an atheist, we talked for hours and he was so relieved there was someone who had experienced the same thing he did, anyway, he actually had a proper discussion with his parent about it, his parents are super-conservative ( wear the niqab and abaya pray 5 times a day ect) and how understanding they were. I hope I got to show how we're not so different and maybe through this we can understand each other better.

EDIT: Thank you so much guys, I hope I was able to get the message across.

And because you guys were so nice, I will share many of the fallacies that my teacher used:

1. Going on how about I was going away from Islam by saying 'Only Atheist believe in evolution'
2. Many people don't believe in evolution thus the matter is debatable
3. Would not let me finish my points- always cuts me to interject
4. Videos of 'atheist philosophers' and former atheist telling me how they saw the light and believe and preach incest to their kids
5.There is little to no evidence of it

Let me get this out of the way. I'm a Mormon. Why am I posting here? because I want your honest opinions. SO! Let's get down to business, shall we? (BTW This is kinda a long post, so you can leave now if you like. If you're still here, then thank you very much.)

I was born and raised a Mormon. I love my faith, I have always been a very happy person. However, in no way am I a Molly Mormon. I live in South Florida for one. But let's not get into all about me. That's not exactly what I'm here for.

I'm dating an agnostic atheist. And I love him with all my heart (hiya, if you're reading this.). I try and do everything I can for him, because if he's happy, I'm happy. (OH! btw, we weren't aware of each others beliefs until a while into our relationship.) And until pretty recently, our relationship has been a healthy and joyful one.

However, as is obvious to all you readers, problems have arisen. He wants to go farther, sexually, than I am willing to go. And this hurts him, because sexual things are very much apart of him. Even though he is supportive of my beliefs, I know he suffers from my restraint. So last week, I told him that I would be willing to go a little farther (making--out with heavy petting). I did this partially because of my wants, but mostly because I felt like he did so much for me, that I wanted to make him as happy as I could. We did what we said we would. Yesterday, we were talking about it, when he asked me if I was still willing to stuff like that. I replied that I felt a little guilty (because my ward has an upcoming temple trip, and I thus need to be clean and worthy to go). he got upset-not angry- but sad. I tried to cheer him up, but to no avail.

Then somehow we got onto the topic of how I never express myself, and he told me that was bad and that he wanted me to vent to him. So I did. After that, he vented to me, generally about his unhappiness with my beliefs. Which is understandable.

So basically, I feel lost. I can't make myself, my religion, and my boyfriend happy at the same time.

I find it unlikely that any of you will have an answer to my problem, but if you DO, then great! Share it, by all means!

***Going through all the comments. Thanks guys, it means a lot to me. I'm also gonna answer a question that many of you have posed to me: Why am I posting on this sub reddit? Because I generally find atheists to be kind and open-minded people. Also, I already know things from my beliefs and point of view, so I also want to know things from other people who believe the same as my boyfriend. ***

By providing a financial benefit to religious institutions, government is supporting religion. Associate Justice of the US Supreme court, William O. Douglas, in his dissenting opinion in Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York, decided May 4, 1970, stated: ""If believers are entitled to public financial support, so are nonbelievers. A believer and nonbeliever under the present law are treated differently because of the articles of their faith… I conclude that this tax exemption is unconstitutional.""

***A tax exemption is a privilege, not a right.*** Governments have traditionally granted this privilege to churches because of the positive contribution they are presumed to make to the community, but there is no such provision in the US Constitution.

***Churches receive special treatment from the IRS beyond what other nonprofits receive***, and such favoritism is unconstitutional. While secular charities are compelled to report their income and financial structure to the IRS using Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax), churches are granted automatic exemption from federal income tax without having to file a tax return.

***A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion***, even if they oppose some or all religious doctrines. As Mark Twain argued: ""no church property is taxed and so the infidel and the atheist and the man without religion are taxed to make up the deficit in the public income thus caused.""

***A tax exemption is a form of subsidy, and the Constitution bars government from subsidizing religion.*** William H. Rehnquist, then-Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, declared on behalf of a unanimous court in Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983): ""Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income.""

***The tax code makes no distinction between authentic religions and fraudulent startup ""faiths,""*** which benefit at taxpayers' expense. In spring 2010, Oklahoma awarded tax exempt status to Satanist group The Church of the IV Majesties. In Mar. 2004, the IRS warned of an increase in schemes that ""exploit legitimate laws to establish sham one-person, nonprofit religious corporations"" charging $1,000 or more per person to attend ""seminars."" The Church of Scientology, which TIME Magazine described in May 1991 as a ""thriving cult of greed and power"" and ""a hugely profitable global racket,"" was granted federal income tax exemption in Oct. 1993. The New York Times reported that this ""saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes."" 

***Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government***, so their tax exemptions are not justified. Tax exemptions to secular nonprofits like hospitals and homeless shelters are justified because such organizations do work that would otherwise fall to government. Churches, while they may undertake charitable work, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing.

***Exempting churches from taxation costs the government billions of dollars in lost revenue***, which it cannot afford, especially in tough economic times. According to former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer, PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property. New York's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office determined in July 2011 that New York City alone loses $627 million in property tax revenue. Lakewood Church, a ""megachurch"" in Houston, TX, earns $75 million in annual untaxed revenue, and the Church of Scientology's annual income exceeds $500 million.

***Despite the 1954 law banning political campaigning by tax-exempt groups, many churches are clearly political and therefore should not be receiving tax exemptions***. Every fall, the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian legal group, organizes ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday,"" encouraging pastors to defy IRS rules by endorsing candidates from the pulpit. More than 500 pastors participated in Oct. 2011, yet none lost their churches' exemption status. In Oct. 2010, Minnesota pastor Brad Brandon of Berean Bible Baptist Church endorsed several Republican candidates and dared the ""liberal media"" to file complaints with the IRS. Brandon later announced on his radio program: ""I'm going to explain to you what happened… Nothing happened.""

***American taxpayers are supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors***, whose lavish ""megachurches"" accumulate millions of tax-free dollars every year. US Senator Chuck Grassley, MA (R-IA) launched an investigation into these groups in Nov. 2007 after receiving complaints of church revenue being used to buy pastors private jets, Rolls Royce cars, multimillion-dollar homes, trips to Hawaii and Fiji, and in one case, a $23,000, marble-topped chest of drawers installed in the 150,000 square foot headquarters of Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton, Missouri.

***The tax break given to churches restricts their freedom of speech because it deters pastors from speaking out for or against political candidates***. As argued by Rev. Carl Gregg, pastor of Maryland's Broadview Church, ""when Christians speak, we shouldn't have to worry about whether we are biting the hand that feeds us because we shouldn't be fed from Caesar/Uncle Sam in the first place."" 

***The ""parsonage exemption"" on ministers' homes makes already-wealthy pastors even richer at taxpayers' expense.*** The average annual salary for senior pastors with congregations of 2,000 or more is $147,000, with some earning up to $400,000. In addition to the federal exemption on housing expenses enjoyed by these ministers, they often pay zero dollars in state property tax. Church leaders Creflo and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International had three tax-free parsonages: a million-dollar mansion in Atlanta, GA, a two-million-dollar mansion in Fayetteville, GA, and a $2.5 million Manhattan apartment. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, leaders of Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth, TX, live in a church-owned, tax-free $6.2 million lakefront parsonage.

You become part of a community. Implies that acceptance of a belief verifies that belief. Applies to any religion or way of thinking that provides you with something to believe in.


* **The book argument** – it’s true because the book says that it’s true. It’s bad to question the book, because of the book being true. Applies to any belief system that relies on written doctrine.


* **The force of numbers argument** – it’s true because lots of other people believe that it’s true, and so many believers can’t be wrong. Implies, by definition, that everything that a lot of people believe is true, is true.


* **The belief argument** – it’s true because I believe it to be true. Implies that belief is truth.


* **The investment argument** – it’s true because I’ve invested so much effort in this belief that my life would be largely a ridiculous waste of time if it were not true. Implies  that the more energy you put into a belief, the truer it becomes.


* **The integrity argument** – It’s true because I’ve told other people that it’s true, and I am  not a liar. Implies that the dissemination of a belief verifies the belief.


* **The experiential argument** – it’s true because I have experienced the influence of the thing I believe in. Implies that people do not interpret their life experiences according to influencing environmental factors, background, emotional, and personal needs.


* **The inner peace argument** – it’s true because I feel peaceful when I believe that there is something big and supernatural looking after my interests. Implies that gaining peace of mind through believing in something is a good basis for judging whether that thing is real.


* **The strength argument** – it’s true because I feel stronger inside myself because of believing that it is true. Implies that inner strength that comes from believing in something verifies the belief.

* **The ignorance argument** – it’s true because there are a lot of complicated things in this world that I don’t understand except by believing that they must have got here by magic performed by a supernatural being. Implies that ignorance is a good basis for deciding that something is true.


* **The indoctrination argument** – it’s true because this is what I have been taught. Implies that indoctrinating someone into believing in something, establishes the truth of that thing.


* **The frightening alternative argument** – it’s true because the alternative frightens me. Implies that truth depends on whether or not you are comfortable with it.


* **The self-interest argument** – it’s true because people have told me that if I don’t believe I will go to Hell, and if I do believe I will go to Heaven. Implies that self-interest is impressive to a god.


* **The character reference argument** – it’s true because everyone who knows me knows that I would not believe in something that is not true. Implies that hearsay of character references inform the truth of a subject.


* **The false prophet argument** – it’s true because everyone who disagrees is a false prophet. Implies that no argument against a set dogma can be valid.


* **The shifting sand argument** – it’s true because I hold fast to each argument until you prove it is not valid. Implies that truth is flexible.


* **The scared argument** – it’s true because I am a coward and can’t face life without the psychological prop of this belief to hold on to. Implies that psychological props are truths.


* **The intelligent design argument** – it’s true because it is completely obvious to everyone except those who refuse to accept it that this fantastic world we live in could not just have sprung out of nothing.  Implies that lack of scientific knowledge invests the truth in those who are ignorant.

Yes, religions will exist, but they will not have the same format or be based around the same doctrine as the religions of today.

Somewhere along the trip I sat next to a kind young nurse from Salt Lake City and we began to chat. 

I had, about 24 hours prior to our meeting, ended a 2 month section hike along the Pacific Crest trail, and I spoke at length of the wonder and beauty that I had experienced on the trail.  We exchanged anecdotes for a couple of hours of all of the things that we had seen in our lives that had impacted us in some profound way.  It was abundantly clear to each of us that we had breached the layer of small talk that so often gets tossed around between strangers and were exchanging our actual thoughts and feelings about the human condition.  Neither of us had mentioned a god or religion at all at this point.

After much conversation she asked me if I had ever experienced death in my life.  I had, and explained how my Mother had commit suicide some 10 years ago, and went on to say how my outlook on life changed, and how difficult it had been to deal with.  I posed the question back to her, and she explained how she had a husband who had died of accidental suicide.  I had rarely felt so strong an empathetic connection to another and was almost sure that she felt the same.  That's when she asked me if any of the ups or downs in my life had made me feel at all religious.

""I can't say that I am, or ever have been."" I replied. ""In fact I'm about as atheist as they come.""  I could tell that this surprised her, and eventually as the conversation wound on she asked if I ever felt as if my deceased Mother ever talked to me, or watched over me.  I explained my belief on the subject: 

That humans have an ability to abstract the characters of others within your imagination.  That it is possible for me to predict how my brother would react if I asked him to lend me money for instance, despite the fact that he is not physically there, and that our social behavior as a species depends greatly upon this ability.  The problem is that when somebody dies this ability doesn't go away, and it gets difficult to tell whether the dead are actually speaking to you, or whether your brain is mucking things up because it is this particular type of machine that is prone to conversing with people who aren't there anyway.  I went on to say that while I really think it is a shame, but that there probably isn't an afterlife and I pragmatically don't expect to see or hear from the dead again.

   I could tell that she felt dejected in some way.  She timidly told me that she had heard from her Husband after his death, and had felt his presence in a way that she was unwilling to believe wasn't real.  ""So I suppose you'd probably just say that all of that was me deluding myself then?"" She said with a bit of an upset smile.  I nodded but I didn't have the heart to say ""Yes"" aloud.  I could tell that that thought was very upsetting to her, and I suspect that she was holding back tears.  Not long after that we resolved to go to sleep.  I left for the restroom and when I returned she had left 20 dollars (I had lost my wallet the day before and didn't have much food for the rest of the journey) and a card from the Mormon church on which she wrote ""Safe Travels"", with no contact information or anything.  She got off the train in the middle of the night in Salt Lake.  

In retrospect I feel like a real dick, as though I genuinely hurt the feelings of a friend, but I did no more than explain my religious beliefs in a rather matter-of-fact way.  I realize that it is common for atheists to offend the religious by virtue of existence, but do you guys have any tips for coming off a little lighter and less like an asshole to the kind religious folk of the world?

TL;DR: Accidentally insinuated to a kind, well-meaning person that I thought she was experiencing delusions, rather than communicating with her dead husband.  Any tips on how to make this not happen, while still honestly describing my position?

What follows is basically a transcription of the video linked above. 

This video is going to be a bit different than the other videos I’ve put out since I don’t have an actual argument that I’m putting forward or refuting. I’m going to talk about my deconversion from being a fundamentalist Christian to being an atheist.  And I really want to do this because I think it’s something that all of us who’ve deconverted want to put out there to maybe help other people who may be going through the same thing.  I’m hoping it’s also useful for life long atheists to help understand where the “faithful” are coming from. 

I’m going to give a brief overview of what my religious background was growing up, there’s a much longer and detailed post about this on my blog that I’m going to link to in the description box.  The long and short of it is that I was born a Catholic and then my family converted to being fundamentalist Christian, specifically Baptists, when I was about 9 years old.  


I was always in Catholic school or Evangelical Christian school up through high school.  I pretty much did the AWANA where you get candy for memorizing bible verses, youth group, youth retreats, the whole nine yards.  I had Young Earth Creationist science classes, Sunday school, church service, bible class, bible tests, and then weekly chapel at school.  The point is, I knew my theology about as well as you could expect for someone who hadn’t gone to seminary to understand theology.  In fact I’d put myself up against most Christians on a test of theological knowledge and I think I’d come out ahead. 

Now I don’t want to say this as a condemnation on my parents.  They actually sacrificed quite a bit to send me to Christian schools.  They were almost always a better option than the public schools and even when they weren’t I was begging them to let me go.  So they sacrificed a bit to do that for us and I have no right to complain about my childhood, it was very good.  So this isn’t anything on them. 

I went to college and I went to a non-Christian school for college because pretty much engineering programs at Christian colleges generally aren’t all that good.  Now you’d think that this is where a Christian kid goes and loses his faith, but it’s not.   I still believed even though I “backslid”.  I started having sex, largely because hormones are more powerful than Jesus, and there was a schism in the church I was in and my parents went through a divorce at the time.  So things happened, and I wasn’t going to church, but I still believed.
Now in fact I actually had a renewal of my faith towards the end of my college experience.  So when I got out of college I took my girlfriend who’s now my wife and I converted her to being an Evangelical Christian.  We went looking for a church, we stopped having premarital sex, and then we got married.  We settled into a very conservative Evangelical Presbyterian Church although I have to admit that by this point I was no longer a Young Earth Creationist, I actually had a Muslim professor explain how the big bang and evolution was still compatible with theism in general.  The church we had was very conservative, but they were open minded enough to let that kind of a view in. 

So I got really involved in the church.  I was their “sound guy” for seven years, I was a trustee, I did small group bible studies, I worked in various ministries, and in general things were very good.   But there was one left over problem, my circle of friends expanded as a result of my wife and college.  You see back before college, I didn’t know anybody who wasn’t my specific brand of Christian, let alone wasn’t a Christian at all.  Through the course of meeting someone and working with them at a Gamestop while I was in school, and they turned out to be friends with my wife, we became good friends.  Eventually they came out as gay and I freaked.  My wife pointed out “you’re an asshole, you’re not supposed to be freaking out about this” and she pointed out that I had no problems with this person before he was gay and that I had no good reason to stop associating with him.  So eventually after my wife and I got married, our friend found a partner.  Us being geeks, we hung out more with our “geek friends” more than our “church friends” which meant that they were hanging out with us all the time.  We became very, very good friends with them and my church at the time said the way to deal with this was we were supposed to be a “light for Jesus”, you were supposed to live and be good, and your life would exemplify the values of Christianity, and that would eventually convert your friends who were gay. 

Now something you need to know about my growing up, someone being gay was pretty much the worst thing ever.  They were pretty much the most out there “demonstrably wrong” thing ever.  So my wife actually did quite a bit of work making me not as bigoted towards gays and so did my friends.  They put up with a lot of shit.  I learned to stop using the word “gay” as an insult.  I stopped using the word “faggot” because that made people I cared about uncomfortable.  

So I stopped being a bigot, yay me!

But then there was another problem.  You see, I realized how much I was and am still in love with my wife.  I knew what love was, and through my friends, let’s call them Jason and Tom, that after knowing them for 8 years, it was clear they had the same kind of loving relationship that my wife and I had.  They went through the same kind of couple issues, we were just so alike.  Basically, I knew what love was, and it was clear as day that they had it.  

I could not call that wrong.  There is no way you could tell me that love is wrong.  Having a loving relationship is probably the most wonderful thing you could ever experience, and to call that wrong just doesn’t compute for me.  

This view on their relationship is in direct contradiction with the bible.  And it was about this time that I was going online and debating politics and eventually came across some criticism of religion.  And while normally this is something I’d blow off, but I couldn’t do that once I started seeing problems with the bible.  And I started finding lots of problems with the bible. 

The biggest problem I found with the bible was now that I actually had friends that I cared about that this applied to, my friends who were clearly in love, and were wrong for their love according to the bible, were going to hell – aka eternal conscious torture.

And that shook me quite a bit. 

As a result all this criticism of religion stuff I read started to stick with me for once.  What didn’t help my faith was that this all came to a head for me while I had taken a temporary work assignment in another country for six months.  During that time I was working so many hours that even though I had my wife with me, we ended up not going to church during that time just because the schedule was just insane. 

I was able to do a lot of reading however, though I kept it to myself.  I started investigating arguments against theism and I finally broke through and asked myself a question that I realized I never asked in the 20+ years I was Christian: “Why do I believe in a god?”

I had no answer for this.  Now one of the things I realized when I asked myself this question was that I was taught this Jesus stuff since I was an infant.  In fact I was taught this by the same people who taught me more concrete things: Ice was frozen water, 2+2=4, and Jesus Christ was the son of god who died for my sins. 

Ultimately every argument I found for Christianity fell back on “you have to have faith” or if it was a problem with Christianity it was “Well we can’t expect to know god’s reasons because he’s so far beyond us.”  And really that’s not a satisfying answer. 

So I read the arguments, the counter arguments, the counter-counter arguments, and eventually when I came back home and started talking to my pastor and church friends about these doubts I was having, they really couldn’t get past the first set of counter arguments and things came back down to the whole faith thing. 
The argument that did it for me was the argument from Hell.  This is because if you believe in Christian theology, then the only thing that existed eternally is god. And eventually god had to decide to create the universe, and god knew that if he gave man free will, which apparently he really had to do, then he would have to create a hell. 

 So god is faced with a choice at this point either he creates the universe and create a hell, and according to Matthew 7:13-14 we’re explicitly told that the majority of mankind will be condemned to hell; or not create.  And for the vast majority of creation it’s far better off to not have been created if you’re going to eventually be condemned to eternal conscious torture. 

So why create? If god is the perfect being and before the creation of the universe he exists in a triune godhead of mutual fulfilling love in the most perfect state possible.  He literally is perfection according to Christian theology.  So he had to create for creation’s benefit, not for his own benefit or any need or want on his end.  

But most of creation is better off not being created!  Hell even if it was a small subset of creation that was better off not being created, the only moral choice is not to create anything!

And that’s pretty much the argument that made me lose my faith. 

One day I eventually broke down and started crying.  I realized I didn’t believe this crap and this was a problem because I converted my wife, the most important person in my life, to being an Evangelical Christian.  

It all hit me at once.  My entire family was Christian.  I realized I’m not seeing my dead relatives ever again.  I might get disowned, what was going to happen to my marriage? Why was I lied to my whole life? Why did I convert people to this terrible religion?

All that hurt, but it was also freeing at the same time.  Unfortunately, the “freeing” part only lasted a little bit before the social fear took over.  I told my wife and she became very upset. She still believed, she wasn’t nearly as conservative as I was and so didn’t see the problems I did since she didn’t have the indoctrination that I had.

So when I showed her things in the bible saying that “No see, hell has to exist.  See, homosexuality is wrong, etc” she was shaken but she still believed in a god and she was still a Christian.

So I threw myself into apologetics. Hardcore.  For two years.  

Trying to make myself go back and believe this shit again so my life could go back to normal.  I spoke to pastors, I spoke to friends, I did everything you could think of – I read William Lane Craig, CS Lewis, Tim Keller, even more liberal theology stuff by like Kenton Sparks.  I read debate after debate online, reading every possible argument I could get my hands on.  I tried to go back, I really did.  And it didn’t work.
There was no argument that could make me believe that shit again. 

Now fortunately for me everything eventually worked out.  My wife and I had stopped talking about the religion thing after a while, but eventually one day my wife told me that she didn’t believe anymore – she wasn’t a Christian.  She is more of an agnostic, but that’s good enough for me.  We spent a long time working out what we did and didn’t agree on, specifically what to do if we had kids. 

That last part was good, because I can’t tell you how happy I am that my wife and I were finally able to have kids, and it was after we deconverted, which is pretty much the best thing ever. 

We eventually did have to tell the extended family at that point, especially now that a kid was involved, that we weren’t Christians.  This has caused some problems, but it wasn’t a disowning like I thought it might be.  It’s been kind of rough but we’ve mostly been good. 

So that’s pretty much it.  As a result of all this I found out that I kind of like philosophy, and having read apologetics and seeing what bullshit it is, I want to help other people who might be going through what I went through.  I want to let people know that it’s OK, you can leave religion.  Life is so much better without cognitive dissonance or thinking that the vast majority of people are going to be suffering eternal conscious torture.  Now I think that there are better reasons than that to leave Christianity, but that’s a topic for future posts/videos. 

Pretty much I wanted to get this out there to let people know my deconversion story and why I’m doing posts and videos.

There are many reasons why you should not be a Christian, but one of the most powerful ways to cause a believer to question their faith is to show them how terrible their supposed god is.  The vast majority of people who identify as Christian are wonderful, loving, good people – and they’ve probably never thought through exactly how terrible their god would have to be if it existed.

One of the most powerful ways to show this is through the argument from the existence of hell. This argument is powerful because it is an internal critique.  It assumes the truth claims of Christianity for the creation and final destiny of the universe, two things that really can’t be whitewashed over as easily as the particularly nasty bits of slavery and genocide in the bible.  That doesn’t mean the apologists won’t try, but this part of Christian theology is so horrible that they’re going to have a hard time of it.

So let’s start with the argument in a simple syllogism:

* 1.)    God is omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good

* 2.)    God chose to create the material universe, heaven, and hell

* 3.)    Hell is eternal conscious torture

* 4.)    There is no moral justification for the eternal conscious torture of any being

* 5.)    Therefore, god is not moral (Contradiction, P1)

The argument becomes even more powerful when you consider the following supporting syllogism, which assumes that god necessarily had to create hell in order to also create the material universe and heaven:

* 1.)    Non-existence is preferable to eternal conscious torture.

* 2.)    If hell was necessary for creation, then before creation god knew there are beings who will suffer eternal conscious torture.

* 3.)    It would be better for those beings (who will end up in hell) to have never been created.

* 4.)    Therefore, their creation was not for the benefit of creatures who end up in hell, but for the benefit of those who will end up in heaven, god, or both.

Think about that for a minute, and consider what this means the Christian god had to consciously decide in the grand scheme of things.

In Christian theology, before creation god is the only thing in existence.  He exists in this trinity of perfect self-fulfilling love.  At some point, decides he will create the angels and heavenly hosts, knowing Satan will arise from that, and a third of the angels will become demons.  He also decides that he will create the material universe and humans, but that humanity will fall and need to be redeemed. And he does all of this so that eventually we can get to a state where all of those who freely choose to love god will live forever in the paradise that is heaven.  Except there will also be those who reject god, and because of god’s justice, those beings must be tortured for eternity in hell.

But if god has this foreknowledge, why not just create only those beings that would freely choose to love god and go straight to heaven?  Well the Christian apologist answer here is that if only those beings were created, then not all of them would choose to love god because they’d be in different circumstances.

This means that in order to achieve the goal of the saved and the angels praising him forever in heaven, god must create the condemned and demons to be tortured forever in hell.   These are beings that would quite literally be infinitely better off if they were never created.   In fact for this group, to be created as some form of animal, like a cat or dog that can just live and then die, would be infinitely better than to be created as an angel or human. 

And this is no small group of people either.  The bible explicitly tells us in Matthew 7:13-14 that a majority of humanity will be condemned to hell, compared to the few who will be saved.  Not that this matters much in terms of the argument from hell.  It’s a lot like the moral thought experiment where one could create the perfect society if only they would perpetually torture one child.  Is it moral to torture the child in order for millions more to be happy?

Like most normal people, I’d say no; emphatically.

But let’s turn the question back to god.  He has the choice here, before creation, to go through with creation, knowing that even a portion of it will be infinitely better off never being created, or he can continue on with his perfect existence as a trinity of self-fulfilling love.  What most people don’t realize is that god had the option to not create. In fact, not creating is the most moral choice he could make if he knows that eternal conscious torture for any subset of beings is required if he is to go through with creation.

The issue is that none of us signed up for this, no one asked to be created.  On Christian theology, all humans are born sinful, already condemned by default, and if they don’t pick the right religion, willingly, then they’re consigned to eternal conscious torture.  And on top of all that, you’re born into a world where we have all the questions of whether or not god exists, let alone whether or not Christianity is the true religion.

Think of this as some kind of demented game show, except you’re drafted in without your consent.  You’ve got to pick the hosts favorite color, get it right and you win infinite wealth but if you get it wrong you’re subjected to torture.  The host never appears directly but remains hidden. He sends his kid out to tell you what his favorite color is, but then also allows in a couple thousand other people in there too, all claiming to be his kid and claiming the host has a different favorite color.  Is that any kind of game show you’d be happy to be a part of?

Seriously Christians, if you believe in hell, this is the god you worship – the god that decided torturing beings for eternity was a price worth paying so some folks could go to heaven.   Is that really something you want to worship, let alone hold up as the standard for morality?

The real good news here is that there’s no evidence that god exists, let alone that Christianity is true. And there’s plenty of evidence that hell is just a myth added in by the writers of the New Testament who were influenced by Greek and Roman views of the afterlife, because if you look at the Old Testament, or talk to some modern Rabbi’s, you’ll find that the Jews don’t really have the concept of hell that Christians do, it’s not in their holy books.

None of that however changes the fact that most Christians do believe hell is real, and as a result do believe that it’s moral to subject people to eternal conscious torture.

I was rolling my fucking eyes so hard. It's the cliche story about finding something that was probably never there to begin with, as they wallow in their hubris to find meaning in something that they only need themselves for.

1374569058.0,311,self.TrueAtheism,1ivh0h,I unexpectedly stumped a christian with science.,gamblingman2,463,152,290,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1ivh0h/i_unexpectedly_stumped_a_christian_with_science/,"I have family who are... very christian. Very. My father is one of a group of leaders of church (pastors who take turns). My family takes discussions of religion VERY, VERY seriously. Atheism is abhorrent to them, and since they're older and since I'm not trying to give them a heart attack I dont mention I'm not a believer.

The wife and I were at my parents for Sunday dinner the other day and dad and I got into a discussion of recent medical advancements. It wasn't going toward religion but I saw a chance to mention something I had read about recently. I casually brought up the development and study to transplant the human brain into a different body. He tried to say that the soul would go to heaven as you cease to exist.

Now normally my dad has an answer to everything. No matter the question there is an answer in the bible as far as he is concerned. If you ask him anything he doesn't just convince you, he will also print out info from the bible software on his computer to help ""advance your knowledge of the bible and your walk with god"". 

This time though I had him stumped. He had no answer. What happens if the brain is transplanted into a new body. He tried to say that ""the body is the home of the soul so you would die and your soul would go to heaven....etc..."" but I countered with ""But isn't it our physical mind that accepts god and chooses to have faith in god? That our body doesn't matter because it's just a machine keeping the brain alive. So our soul uses the brain to accept god, right? So the soul would not be in heaven."".

He was stumped because it's thought that upon ""death"" the soul leaves the body. But what is death and by the same token what/when is the beginning of life!? If we can remove our brain, thus we keep thinking, and our brain is kept in a jar alive and still thinking/developing then we are still 'gamblingman2' and we are not dead. So what is the body if not the home of the holy spirit? Or is the bible missing a page? If we are nothing more than a blob of thinking power who can accept whatever, then what is god to that ""person""? 

With the bible talking about how your body is a temple of the holy spirit, I guess ""god"" (goat herders) couldn't foresee medical advancements 2000 years later. Funny how the famous text can't keep up with technological advancement and its only a matter of time before its left behind just like how we no longer believe our national leader is the sun god. Old outdated religions have a tough time with the pinpointing the actual point of the beginning/end of life. Since their text doesn't have a definitive answer to these questions, believers have to make that decision themselves, independently.

Moreover so much of what people accept as belief in god is partly rooted in a bodily sensation, feeling better, whole. I can remember when growing up that people talked about feeling better when accepting god or praying, repenting, etc.... But if there is no body to ""feel good"", a lot of what christians think/believe begins to fall apart. Sounds odd doesn't it, but its true.

1352771260.0,307,self.TrueAtheism,133j3q,My high school had a Veteran's Day assembly that ended up being highly offensive. I now have an audience with the principal to discuss it. How do you recommend I approach this discussion?,stereotype_novelty,369,62,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/133j3q/my_high_school_had_a_veterans_day_assembly_that/,"So let me provide some back-story:

On Friday, there was an assembly attended by everyone in their senior year. It was a fairly typical Veteran's Day presentation - the school's elite choir sang, there was a slideshow of depressing war-related imagery, several local veterans spoke on their experiences, politicians spoke: nothing of that was what struck me and the general populace as wrong.

At two points during the assembly, a local priest (Father Gannon, as it were) stood at the podium and spoke. He instructed the audience to rise, make the sign of the cross, and join him in prayer. Both times he ended his clearly Christian mini-sermons with a ""blessing from Christ"" and statement that it is through God's love and grace that we find peace and happiness.

Needless to say, my fellow students were stunned. Confused and uncertain whispers broke out immediately both times, and no matter where you sat you could hear someone asking ""Can they do that?"" or ""Is that allowed?"" and everyone felt extremely uncomfortable. Several of my atheist friends walked out and caught some serious flak from their peers, one even going so far as to say that ""Jews and Muslims have gotten used to this, atheists need to shut up."" The only thing that kept me from doing the same thing was the hawk-like stare of my choir director.

Our school is a very culturally-diverse one. People here practice all faiths, from every sect of Christianity to Judaism to the various forms of Islam to Sikhism to Buddhism. I found it highly inappropriate for the school to allow the unnecessary and exclusive injection of a single religion's ideas and practices into what very well should have been a secular event. Many others agreed, but were unwilling to act on it.

With a few careful conversations I have landed myself an audience with the school's principal (who was supposedly unaware of the Father's plans to do such a thing). A few of my friends (not all atheist, mind you) are going to be accompanying me in delivering our ideas to the principal as eloquently and persuasively as possible so as to assure that this does not happen again.

All meaning is man-made, so make your own, and make it well. Do not treat life as a way to pass the time until you die.

Do not try to ""find yourself"", you must make yourself. Choose what you want to find meaningful and live, create, love, hate, cry, destroy, fight and die for it. Do not let your life and your values and your actions slip easily into any mold, other than that which you create for yourself, and say with conviction, ""This is who I make myself"".

Do not give in to hope. Remember that nothing you do has any significance beyond that with which you imbue it. Whatever you do, do it for its own sake. When the universe looks on with indifference, laugh, and shout back, ""Fuck You!"". Remember that to fight meaninglessness is futile, but fight anyway, in spite of and because of its futility.

As far as I could ascertain, it was neither benevolent nor did it seem to have any stake in human affairs. I suppose my childhood beliefs could be categorized as deistic, although I admit I believed that there was an afterlife.

My eventual arrival into apostasy, and then anti-theism wasn't spectacular by any standards, but it wasn't an easy choice to make, in retrospect it wasn't a choice at all. I couldn't ignore the reality of the universe, and this is before I had an academic understanding of astronomy, biology or history. Since then I've heard numerous accounts of how people handle their own apostasy; for some it was liberating, others felt resentful or dejected and some others saw it as a non-issue. To summarise my own sentiments, losing faith made me uncomfortable.

The day I lost my faith, was the day my life truly began. It wasn't a period filled with profound revelations and sunrises, it more closely resembled being expelled from my mother's womb like a cannonball. I arrived into this new life the same way I arrived into this world; traumatized, terrified and dragged into it  kicking and screaming. The people and objects were strange and unfamiliar, and I missed my old home where it was dark and comfortable and simple.

I missed the idea of surviving my own death, and I cannot agree more that my limited existence has brought upon an appreciation of life. I would never trick myself into believing something that isn't true. I've peeked beyond the curtain, and never found any wizard pulling levers or a road to paradise. It was only empty space, and it became increasingly vacant upon scrutiny.

I write this because firstly I wanted atheists to know that in all the impossibilities of our existence in a universe of infinite variables, we can concurrently be in awe and terror of our life. Secondly, I don't want atheist to resent religious people for wishing to live their life under the pre-tense that they will not only live forever, but be with their loved ones. I still having panic attacks at night at the idea of a nothingness, and while I would not say ignorance is bliss, I don't consider it a mercy to deny people of that hope, no matter how futile it may seem. And without condoning nor condemning, I understand why people resist letting go the warmth of faith, even if that warmth is illusory.

-----

I go in and out of waves of feeling calm about the church, and then getting worked up into a mental rage.

So, it's time to organize my brain into logical thoughts and work through it, and you lovely people get to come along for the ride.

-----

The church has controlled everything in my life. Like, every fucking thing. Let's just start off with the major events.

**Birth**

Sure, my parents named me when I was born, but that was just for legal reasons at the hospital. The church then has you give your baby and name and a blessing to be put on church records, which are the only records in the world that matter, because everything is a cheap K-Mart knockoff of the One True.

Oh, and to do this, my parents had to make sure that they were paying tithing, otherwise my dad wouldn't have been ""worthy"" to bless me.

**Childhood**

The day before my eighth birthday, I could have murdered everyone in my primary class and gone to heaven. I could have slashed their bellies open and ripped out their intestines and choked them to death with them, engaged in a firefight with the police as I burned down the church, gone out in a blaze of glory, and still would have made it to the right hand of God in the Celestial Kingdom.

Once I turned eight, I was now responsible for all of my actions. If I didn't choose to get baptized, I would be acting like a dark and loathsome Lamanite, and not a ~~white~~ fair and delightsome Nephite. I didn't want to join the bad guys that I had been warned about all my life, so of course I chose to get baptized.

Oh, and my parents better have been paying tithing for my dad to be worthy to baptize and confirm me.

**Adolescence**

So, when I got baptized, I had been told that if you want to follow Jesus, then you get baptized. If you want to follow Satan, you don't get baptized. So, I got baptized.

But they hadn't told me all of the rules. They told me about tithing, with the Smarties and giving one of the 10 away. So I guess I knew I was committing to that. But nobody ever told me I was committing to the Law of Chastity. I didn't commit to that before I joined, but it turned out that there were plenty of other things that I had committed to that were not laid out plainly.

At 12, 14, and 16 I had checkpoints for priesthood. My dad had them too, and he had to make sure that he was paying tithing to be worthy at each checkpoint to ordain me along the way.

**Mission**

I was the first guy in my ward to go on a mission in about 6 years. People were really excited about it. I felt so fucking great that I was at the tip of a new wave of missionaries in my ward.

And of course, going on a mission isn't a saving ordinance, and isn't a checkpoint for going to heaven, but it is a commandment by The Prophet to go, and you have to remember:

*Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.*

*What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, ... but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.

So, even if the prophets are wrong about anything, God is going to back them up, because their commandments might as well be his, according to D&amp;C.

So, I decided I didn't want to put my soul at risk by disobeying a commandment from God, so I decided to go.

Oh, and my dad had to be paying tithing to ordain me to an Elder and participate in setting me apart as a missionary, and in my release.

**Marriage**

I now had to make sure that I was paying tithing to get married.

Before the 1940's, the typical Mormon wedding was done in a civil ceremony, and then you would get scheduled to go get sealed later. Somehow this all got flipped around, and then the emphasis became that you got civilly married in the temple and sealed at the same time.

But only if you are an American, now a minority in the Church. The empire has grown so that there are more members outside the States than within. So, the majority of members are allowed to get civilly married, and then go get sealed within a standardized time frame.

If you try to do this in America, you lose your temple worthiness for a year before you are allowed to get sealed. We know that Americans are held to a different set of rules than foreigners, which is indicative that members outside America really don't matter - they are just foreign franchises to bring in tithing.

It used to be that foreigners were to sell their property, even at a loss, and move to Salt Lake City, because The Big One was right around the corner. Once the Church that Joseph Smith founded (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints) got its ass handed to it by the US Government, and was officially dissolved that all changed. Heber Grant started his own spin-off religion called The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (hyphen and lower-case *d*) and Mormonism 2.0 was rolled out. I'm digressing.

**Adulthood**

I have kids now, and I was now expected to be paying tithing to be ""worthy"" to bless them as babies, and baptize them. Soon enough they will be old enough for the Aaronic Priesthood, and I will have several more checkpoints for tithing.

Once you stop believing as an adult, you are in a shitty situation.

You don't believe, and your spouse might still be believing. You both entered into an agreement that this was for time and all eternity. Since the temple sealing has been morphed with civil marriage, it is now a Temple Marriage, and the two are inseparable.

If you reject the Church, then your temple blessings are dissolved, which means you must be rejecting your Temple Marriage, and therefore your wife and children. You don't care about them enough to stick around to make it to the Celestial Kingdom. Your wife has lost her Godhood, and your familial line has been broken.

You are now unworthy to stay married to her, and she should probably find another guy who will give her the chance to make it to Godhood.

Lucky for me, my wife is on my side.

But now we have another problem - our parents. If we leave the church, we will be accused of child abuse, because if you aren't Mormon, the only other option is being a heroin-addicted, drunk-driving, wife-swapping, child-molesting abortionist. 

The man is always the one to blame, because he is the spiritual leader of the home. The only way a man could lose his testimony is if he lost the spirit by sinning by looking at pornography.

Fucking Spiritual Hostage Taking.

**Death**

The church's official policy is that your funeral isn't about *you*.

[Funerals—A Time for Reverence / Boyd K. Packer ](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1988/10/funerals-a-time-for-reverence?lang=eng)

&gt;*Except where burial is prohibited by law, we are counseled to bury our dead. There are important symbolic references to burial in the ordinance of baptism and elsewhere in the doctrines of the Church.*

&gt;Funerals held under the direction of the priesthood are Church meetings. They have been likened to sacrament meetings. I quote from a priesthood bulletin:

&gt; - “It is requested that henceforth all funerals conducted under the auspices of the officials of the Church follow the general format of the sacrament meeting with respect to music, speaking, and prayers. Music should be used at the beginning of the service prior to the opening prayer and possibly after the invocation also, as in our Sunday meetings. The closing portion of the funeral likewise should follow our customary pattern of having a final musical number immediately before the concluding prayer. Where feasible, a choir could very well be used on the musical program.

&gt; - “With respect to speaking, it should be kept in mind that funeral services provide an excellent opportunity for teaching the basic doctrines … in a positive manner. …

&gt; - “Following these suggestions will help to keep our services in line with our established pattern and will avoid practices now so commonly followed elsewhere.” (Priesthood Bulletin, Apr. 1972.)

&gt;*If family members do speak, and I repeat, it is not a requirement, they are under the same obligation to speak with reverence and to teach the principles of the gospel.*

&gt;*Funerals generally bring relatives and friends from distant places. There is the tendency to greet one another joyfully and, unfortunately, at times noisily. Some visit at length, showing little regard for others who are waiting to pay their respects. Both the irreverence and the delay are discourtesies from which the spirituality of the occasion suffers.*

So, there you have it from a Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, sustained by 14 million upraised hands. Funerals are church property, and are controlled by church, and you should only speak about the Gospel, and not about the person, and family members should not be happy to see each other or spend time with each other.

-----

So, those are the major things. What are the small things in my life that the church tries to control?

Just my opinions on Politics, Law, Sex, Sexuality, Science, Medicine, Music, Movies, Literature, and Education.

**Science**

On science, the church has very wishy-washy public proclamations, especially on Creationism vs Evolution. Sure the official PR stance takes the Non-Overlapping Magesteria (NOMA) stance, but leadership always denies evolution as being of the devil.

Sure, there may be a few members out there who are okay with Evolution, and they even teach it at BYU, but the leadership, especially Bruce McConkie, openly denies it.

BYU religion professors, including McConkie's son, frequently get pissed off and challenge the (LDS) zoology professors and try to get evolution taken out of curriculum because their students come to them confused and conflicted.

**Medicine**

Priesthood blessings don't work. Stop pretending that they do. People feel that they receive revelations from the Lord that they are supposed to be faithful and only rely on God to heal them from a disease. Stop this.

**Politics**

Cunts like Cleon Skousen write books that mingle the political philosophies of men with scripture, and write books that Communism was inspired by Satan to destroy America and the Church. Cunts like David McKay endorse these books to the membership.

Let's say this. ""Members of the more mainstream conservative movement and the American Security Council snubbed him out of fear that his controversial views would hurt the credibility of the conservative movement."" Cleon was too crazy to join hard-core conservative groups.

**Sex and Sexuality**

I'm running out of steam, so I'll be brief.

The church made me disregard women and hate gays. I don't anymore.

1370596860.0,292,self.TrueAtheism,1fupc9,"I have unwillingly become atheist. I did not want to, but my brain had other plans. Been dealing/processing with the aftermath still...",tautomers,374,82,205,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1fupc9/i_have_unwillingly_become_atheist_i_did_not_want/,"Hi. I am going to try and keep this as short as I can. It will make it easier for the information to be digested. (edit: fail. I'm known for being verbose for a reason. tl;dr at the bottom).

It's been in the works for several years now, but earlier this year, I'd say around Feburary, something interesting happened. My spiritual beliefs, which I have held since a small child, started to die and wither away. It was rather insidious and I didn't even really notice it at first. I was too busy with school and life to pay it any attention. It was catalyzed by a series of very unfortunate events in the lab I work in. Lots of things failing for very very minor errors. It really sunk in that ""my god, life is really harsh, I can't handle this"". Weeks rolled on by and I realised that ""oh... you know, none of the beleifs I hold can stand the tests of logic, can they"". The burden of proof was on me, and I could not fulfill it. Uh oh.

*Poof*, by bye spiritual comfort. It suddenly was gone. I was raised by a very loving mother who taught me many of the spiritual beliefs I held. I interpreted them on my own. She never forced any of it on me, she never made me do anything with it. I was simply shown, and if I was interested I followed. It had much meaning. She's considered ""new age"". She reads tarot, astrology, follows easter philosphy ideas. You get the idea. Ideas like synchroncities, astrology, incidental messages were things I took to heart, read into, and gave me much direction and meaning in my life. The beliefs ultimately, were comforting. It allowed me to ""forsee the future"", see the good, and ultimately place hope in the distance so I could move forward through hard parts of my life. In hindsight, it was a vast stabalizing factor that I used for many things.

The thing is, it's not based on any sort of fact. The only thing that remains that seems to have some sort of relevance is astrology, but it's weak, and a discussion I do not care to get into now. It dawned on me, that up to this point in my life, I just have been extremely lucky. Significantly so, to the point where I was so alarmed by it I actually felt sick. I found it to be really disturbing. I wondered how long my luck would keep going, and it wasn't pretty. Some methods of making decisions actually appear to be quite stupid or even dangerous. 

Through a series of rather simple, but poignent logical thoughts, I have surmized that there is no reason or basis for anything I have previously put stock into, and therefore holding it will not do any good, and could even cause damage. I couldn't keep my former beliefs even if I wanted to; I can't unthink and forget what I have thought even if I tried.

Now that's all well and good, but there's a few problems with this (on in particular which is quite major). The first is a lot of the meaning I have garnered from life has evaporated. I was easily amazed and dazzled as a kid, and got a significant amount of fulfillment out of the unknown and mysterious. I absolutely thrived off it. It's why I lived. But I also sought to understanding everything behind it as much as I could. However, in my lifelong quest to understand anything I come across, I have found a lot of the ""why"". all that remained was the spiritual, and now that's gone too.

The second, and more serious problem, deals with my mental health. Several months ago I was suicidal (I am in a much better headspace now), and a chunk of it was spurred by all of this. My beliefs were stabalizing because one particular thought was that suicide would doom you to repeat your life again, in a more difficult manner. Simply put, that's hooey, but it also made me quite fearful of suicide. With that gone, the wall for that isn't exactly there. Luckily I am better at the moment. Mind you, I still have the emotional component (fear) of that that I can't quite shake (several former belief's have this). I found myself not really seeing much of a consequence on my end, thus, there were urges. Luckily no plans.

While I am better now, this does have further implications. With the evaporation of my beliefs, I can no longer use the logically incorrect tools to help ""fix"" the events of the future in any context. Right now, the future of the world as a whole looks really grim. I went through a very bad depressive episode over exactly this about a year and a half ago when I became ""hyper aware"" of the state of the world, and I managed to back off it. When I am feeling fine, I am feeling fine. However when I start to spiral, many of these thoughts of the world creep in, and it's very hard to dig up the urge to move forward. All because there is no one, no thing, nothing at all that can save me, or us. We're totally on our own. If life is just a struggle to suffer and get through, then pray tell what is the point? Don't actually answer that, I've already had that discussion.

Really though, where do I go from here. Ever since I have pulled myself out of a depression well last month, I have felt like I am in this weird limbo state. Mentally, I am an atheist, and there isn't going back. Logic is logic for a reason. Emotionally, I am kind of there, but not really. My emotions are complex (yay aspergers!), so it's not something that is going to be easily sorted out, and it's sort of clouding the mental logic. I feel like instead of defaulting to an esoteric explination for something, I am halfway burying my head in the sand over painful issues as a defense and coping mechanism. Ultimately, a part of me has not let go, and I don't think it ever will let go. If just for the fact that it has been with me since I was so young. In some strange way I can't explain, I feel like part of it still can have some practical use, but I can't properly articulate this.

*Somethings still a-miss, somethings not right, and I am failing to recognize it. One thing I am fairly certain of, is my brain is blocking me from thinking of what's off for my own good. I'm pretty self aware, and I can recognize this. My brain isn't letting me articulate what's off because if I were to, it would cause me to deeply plummet, possibly further than before. The problem is this is starting to cause more emotional blunting, which over time becomes extremely problematic for me in a pretty significant way.*

I talked with my therapist a month ago, and one thing we both mutually agreed with, is that there are some things in this world, that are beyond what we know, and science, and human knowledge simply isnt there yet. She said that I don't need to have such a black and white label. That said, this fits best. I am still trying to intergrate all of this together. I in essnce have burned my foundation to the ground, and am starting over from the ground up. This time, the foundation is atheism, and most bricks will be made of that, but it might be possible for them to not all be.

Honestly, I am not sure what I am asking. I think I am just articulating my thoughts into the ether so I know it's at the very least read.

I will finish by saying I know about the suicide subreddits, and all related issues associated with it. At the moment I am fine.

**tl;dr** I became atheist because I became aware of what logic actually is, and I can't exactly unthink what I have. All of my spiritual beliefs have evaporated. I am dealing with the aftermath, and in particular where to go from here, as I am at a point where I really just don't know where I am going.

thanks for reading!


**EDIT:** Thank you everyone for your replies. I have read all of them, and am continuing to do so. It would be impractical to reply to everyone, but at the very least I am going to reply to some of them. If I have any after thoughts from this, I'll put them in here. For a little background because it was mentioned at a few places, and I feel it is relevant, I am a PhD student studying organic chemistry. I've ALWAYS been into science as far back as I can remember. I have always been an experimenter, and explorer. Mostly because I, ironically, hate mystery. I ultimately want answer, and more importantly, closure. I was also diagnosed with aspergers when I was 9. I have since outgrown it, and almost no one would suspect I have it. Speaking with my therapist though, we both agree I still have remainders of it that stick around (i.e. I think and feel differently from most people), but have learned how to manage it.

1361736229.0,291,self.TrueAtheism,195aw4,The historical Jesus as a failed apocalyptic prophet,chomiv,318,27,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/195aw4/the_historical_jesus_as_a_failed_apocalyptic/,"I'm gonna bring up a view of Jesus that doesn't get spoken about enough in atheist/skeptic communities, but is the majority view amongst New Testament scholars (like Bart Ehrman, Paula Fredriksen, Dale Allison and Gerd Ludemann)--that Jesus was a Jewish Apocalyptist who preached that Yahweh was going to intervene in human history in his own generation and establish a utopian kingdom on Earth. His twelve disciples were going to rule over the twelve tribes of Israel, while Jesus was going to be God's right hand man. Scholars quibble over the exact details, but the majority view is that Jesus preached an imminent judgement. 

This discovery, when I was a Christian, basically exposed Jesus as a first century David Koresh. In fact, the similarities between Jesus and modern cult leaders is pretty staggering (they're all obsessed with cosmic judgement and promise their followers rewards, are dissatisfied with the state of the world and want to start a revolution, etc).
 
All of the writings in the later epistles give the impression that Christianity started out as a Messianic doomsday cult that was suffering through serious cognitive dissonance once the apostles started to die off.  This led to them reinterpreting their leader's message, exactly the same way UFO cults change their prophecies when theirs fail (for evidence of this, check out the book When Prophecy Fails). 

Bart Ehrman sums it up well here:

 **""Jesus of Nazareth was an apocalyptic prophet who anticipated the imminent end of the age and who warned his Jewish compatriots to repent in view of the cosmic crisis that was soon to come. God, Jesus proclaimed, would intervene in the course of history to overthrow the forces of evil, sending from heaven a divine-like figure called the Son of Man in a cataclysmic act of judgment. This Son of Man would bring a new order to this world, a utopian kingdom to replace the evil empire that oppresses God’s people. And this was to occur within Jesus’ generation"".** (Source: http://ehrmanblog.org/) 

These failed prophecies are all over the NT:
Mark 9:1 And he said to them, ""I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of God come with power."" (This saying is repeated throughout the Synoptic gospels)

Mark 14:62 ""I am,"" said Jesus. ""And **you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.""**

Chapter 13 of Mark is one big apocalyptic rant, but here's just a sample:


 24“But in those days, after that tribulation, THE SUN WILL BE DARKENED AND THE MOON WILL NOT GIVE ITS LIGHT,25
AND THE STARS WILL BE FALLING from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.26“Then they will see THE SON OF MAN COMING IN CLOUDS with great power and glory.27“And then He will send forth the angels, and will gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest end of the earth to the farthest end of heaven.


And then, Paul (who wrote all his letters before the gospels were written) and the other epistle writers repeat the expectation of an imminent cosmic event:

1Thessalonians 4:17 After that, **we who are still alive** and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.

1 Corinthians 7:29 What I mean, brothers, is that the time is short. From now on those who have wives should live as if they had none;

1 Corinthians 7:31 those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.

1 John 2:18 **Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour.**

For me this utterly debunks Christianity. I'm sure there are believers who somehow ignore this, but I can't take Christianity seriously in any way after reading the NT and coming to the conclusion that these folks were illiterate religious fanatics who wanted to watch the world burn (seriously, Jesus says that in Luke 12:49), the same way countless cults have done before and since then.",,False,,t5_2soy6,1361816211.0,,,True,t3_195aw4,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/195aw4/the_historical_jesus_as_a_failed_apocalyptic/,

A lot of this happened throughout my high school and college years - years that I should have spent figuring out who I was, what made me *me*.

He's tried countless doctors and medications and nothing helps him.  Marijuana is the only thing that allows him to be at peace with the crazy shit going on in his head.  The way he describes it, is that if he sits in silence for too long, the ""demons"" come back.  He lives in fear of his own mind and he almost killed himself because of it.
 
Then he found this new age religion called ""Spirit Science"" ( http://thespiritscience.net/spirit/ ).  I've never heard of it until now, and it seems very fringe.  To be honest, it doesn't seem that bad: it focuses on giving to others, positive thinking, mediation and being ""one with the universe"".

There's also some batshit crazy stuff in it too, like hebrews are ancient martians that came to earth 8000 years ago, and the blue glow of the earth is a ""conciousness field"" that connects everyone on the planet.  There's a video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NNHmV3QPw that describes most of it.  The basic premise is there are lots of gaps/inconsistencies in our human history, so they fill them with some pretty far fetched stuff.  It's a mix of the ""God of the Gaps"" style argument, as well as an argument from incredulity.  It seems much more convincing because it uses things we know now, thanks to modern science, and inserts its own brand of myth into the things we don't know yet.  It also borrows many names and events from other religions, so that they can tell you ""Our explanation is consistent with most other religious 'history' so it's more likely to be true!"".

When my friend first shared the video on Facebook, I had no idea that he actually believed this...or that he has been suicidal for the past 2 months.  Being the militant-atheist, anti-religion, anti-ignorance, pro-science person I am, I took a great deal of time refuting the video, mostly just pointing how misinformed many of the ""facts"" in this video are.

Suddenly, he tells me ""Why are you attacking my beliefs?  I was suicidal before this, and now you are trying to make me go back to that!""  Of course, the classic retort is ""It might make you feel good but that doesn't make it true"", but when he told me he was suicidal that made me step back for a minute.  I had no idea he was feeling this way, or that he was even going through the stuff I described in the first paragraph.  Hell, it didn't even dawn on me that he actually believed this stuff -- it seemed way too far fetched for anyone to believe it -- so I thought I would just have some fun debunking a silly video.

Then, I thought for a minute, and then I realized...despite believing this stuff, he hasn't really changed much.  He's more humble, and at peace with himself, but he's still the same awesome person I remember and he doesn't push it on other people.  Even the website doesn't try to push it on you, it just tells you to watch the videos and make your own decision.  Nothing really wrong with that.

Ultimately, I realized it's more important to choose your battles: I'd rather have a best friend with 1 harmless delusion that makes him a better person, than a dead best friend.

We want to be honest about our reasons for leaving and we don't want to hurt any feelings when we break the news. We have a number of close friends at the church who we want to stay close with.

I realized that the most potent forces for atheism are not the arguments we make against religion. No, the most potent points against religion are exactly those that do not set out to destroy religion but implicitly do so.

That is why evolution is so scary to people of all religions. Evolution was never come upon to attack religion. It's a purely scientific theory that only tries to explain the diversity of species and not only succeeds but gives the background or framework to do much more. Modern biology and medicine are unthinkable without evolution.

One of the first things religious apologists will try to do is twist that fact and say that ""evolutionists"" have an agenda. But that's patently false.

Therein lies the strength of science. It's an inquiry that is founded on nothing but pure curiosity that sets out without assuming anything except in the form of hypotheses that might be refuted or refined along the way. But while doing this dispassionate research, it often comes upon results that contradict human-centric worldviews. This is of course very distressing because it takes a lot of denial to reject the conclusions of such sound research. So you have to deny it even is proper scientific research in the first place.

That's where we come to what I say in the title. Often, religious people in debates will force us to play on their terrain, arguing against their worldview. And I see many atheists going along with this. I'm not saying we should always avoid it, but I feel it happens just too often.

It's time we just boldly affirm our worldview and that we force them to argue from our viewpoint.

P.S.: I know some people will come around and say not all atheists have a scientific perspective on things. Yeah yeah, I know that. But fuck those people too. If you're going to argue against science, better get your shit together.

**TL;DR Science bitches!**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT**: In this very thread, I'm having an exchange with masterwad that is very interesting because it is exactly what I'm trying to explain in my main post. masterwad points out that Hindu religion seems to have some rudiments of big bang cosmology in it. Maybe there is something to his claim, I didn't look at it in detail. But the point is the following:

If you are going to attack religion because of internal inconsistencies or not agreeing with scientific facts, someone is going to come along and say: but look, this religion does not have internal inconsistencies or it does agree with scientific facts. And there you will be stuck. Does that mean they are right? An emphatic ""NO!"" resounds. I don't think masterwad is a Hindu, and if he is, I don't see anyone converting to Hinduism because of his arguments.

The problem is that we are not being scientific enough in our attack. Say, tomorrow someone comes along and proves that everything we knew about the age of the Earth and the origin of species is wrong. The Earth is really 10,000 years old and species did not come about by evolution. Can you imagine the outcries of joy of all the biblical literalists? Does that make them right? 

NO. It would only show that we were wrong all along. And that's it. But it wouldn't make them right. The real question for them is ""How did you know?"". And to that, they can not give an answer that is scientifically satisfactory.

I wanted to discuss a few things that I've seen said over and over about the new pope see if I can give some insight. Being in a Catholic country people are (mostly) happy about the designation, though it's mostly out of nationalist pride than anything else. Personally I was mostly surprised but really don't care. So here goes:

**1. Sure, he's South American, but he is white and Italian**

Most people in Argentina are white and Italian, sorry, that's just history for you. We had the second or third biggest wave of immigration in the 1860s-70s (with the US and Brazil) and most people descend from Europeans. 

**2. He's a homophobe**

No doubt. When the legalization of same sex marriage was passed last year, Bergoglio was one of the biggest voices for the opposition writing some strongly worded letters that you've surely read. On this subject he will probably not be a force of change.

**3. He won't change anything**

Politically the Church is in big trouble trying to compromise old values and a new world order, especially since it's population has shifted to the South. Bergoglio's designation means a step in that direction and the issue of poverty is at the center. 
Bergoglio has been a life long champion for poverty, having rejected the privileges of his powerful office. Anecdotes of him riding the bus to and fro, having close to no possessions and even paying his own small hotel bill for the visit to the vatican may seem small, but the Church, being one of the richest and most powerful institutions in the world, with great influence over huge amounts of poor people, if it tried, could be a great force in pushing charitable projects, like clean water, housing, and education initiatives. Maybe I'm being optimistic, but I think this may be the one bright spot of Bergoglio's designation.

**4. He cooperated with the Military Dictatorship in the 70's.**

The reports on Bergoglio's activities during the military dictatorship are mixed. His primary detractor is Horacio Verbitsky, a great journalist who is nonetheless clear about his feelings about the church and wrote an entire book about the church's various questionable activities in Argentina since the time of the colonies.

While his work is not questionable in and of itself, people who accuse him of having a vendetta against Bergoglio may not be far off. On the other hand, Adolfo Perez Esquivel, a Nobel Peace Prize winner for his humanitarian work during the 70s and 80s who was himself a detainee of the Junta has said Bergoglio had NO ties to the dictatorship and even try to free a few of his church members by testifying in their behalf. ([source in spanish, sorry](http://www.infobae.com/notas/700917-Perez-Esquivel-El-Papa-no-tenia-nexos-con-la-dictadura.html)) The main point of discussion here is the fate of two priests who were detained during that time (one was freed, the other died in jail). Some people accuse Bergoglio of turning him in, others say he tried to free them. The church's silent complicity during the 70s is not in doubt, but Bergoglio was very young back then so his influence is less than has been publicized by his opposers.

I personally have not made up my mind about him on this subject but overall, looking forward, I never expect the church to change their policies about homosexuality, but if they turned their resources to social problems in poor countries I think he'd certainly be better than Ratzinger.

1353238009.0,253,self.TrueAtheism,13e8qi,Had a discussion on religion with my co-worker. He ended up quitting without notice to live a nomadic life like Jesus. Not my intention.,booljayj,308,55,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/13e8qi/had_a_discussion_on_religion_with_my_coworker_he/,"A few days ago I started having some interesting discussions with one of my co-workers. It started with talking about the health effects of pot (he argued there were no negative effects, I gave him some evidence to the contrary), and ended up on the topic of Christianity and Jesus.

He turned out to be a devout Christian, believing that the bible was infallible, that it was divinely inspired in its entirety, and that he knew that God was real because he ""felt the holy spirit move within him."" I was surprised to learn that he believed some of these things, but we talked a little bit about the Bible, the concept of evidence, and how his religious feelings may be felt by people of vastly different religions. Since work was a poor place to talk about these kind of things in any detail, we agreed to meet up for lunch in three days to talk about the subject.

The next day, he wasn't at work, nor was he the second. I assumed that he was sick, or that he had some other emergency that came up. Nevertheless, we met up for lunch, and I learned that after our discussion, he had made the decision to quit his job entirely, without notice, and live a life wholly devoted to ""following christ,"" as he put it. We did still talk about Christianity, and I touched on a lot of topics. My main points were that the Bible has changed drastically over the years, that Jesus (and Yahweh) held some very immoral positions, that God's punishment of Adam and Eve was unjust because they did not know what they did was wrong, and that believing in God or magic means the universe would be impossible to understand in the slightest capacity. He fought me on every point, and ended the conversation by simply stating that until I ""wanted it to be true"" and ""felt the power of christ,"" I would just be unable to understand what he does.

My point here is that his reaction was entirely unexpected. I thought we were having a harmless discussion about religious beliefs, and I accidentally pushed him even further into a mindset that may end up harming him greatly. He is now unemployed and living off the state, and while I am not completely responsible, I did trigger this reaction. Has anyone else experienced something similar, where a discussion with a reasonable religious person has accidentally pushed them into fanaticism?

I don't think it's really relevant to this subreddit, and it's definitely not what I posted here to discuss, but I'll give you what you asked for.

I quickly realized that I had a choice: I could wave it away through any of a number of excuses, or I could follow my curiosity and see how deep the rabbit-hole went. What ultimately happened was a very intense year or two where I ended up reading several dozen books on a wide variety of topics and changing my opinions on a significant number of issues.

The other day I was skimming through [this](http://www.amazon.com/Whats-Matter-Kansas-Conservatives-America/dp/080507774X) book, and the author made a point about how soon after his father-in-law became a Republican because of the pro-life debate he changed his views on virtually every other political issue to be in line with the standard Republican position. Evolution is a hoax, humans don't affect the climate, Reagan was a hero of the people, welfare programs discourage productivity and hurt the poor, etc.

I realized that I had done basically the same thing in reverse. I've tried to be objective and minimize the influence of biases, but I've found myself defending Keynesian economics to Republicans and Libertarians when I've never taken a single economics class and my knowledge consists of reading a handful of pop-econ books and a few dozen blog posts. Why am I doing this? Why should I expect that Democrats have better economic policy than Republicans simply because I think they're substantially more on target with other issues like women's rights? I've almost gotten to the point where I feel like I shouldn't express any opinions at all. I'm halfway through my second-year of medical school and I can barely hold a conversation with doctors in most specialties. What makes me think I can pontificate intelligibly on economics or social science just because most of my peers are politically liberal and I've heard their opinions often enough to repeat them?

If there's a question anywhere in this rant, I guess it's that I want to be able to know that when I'm evaluating the evidence for an argument that I'm doing so as objectively as possible and not letting what I want to be true (because it aligns with the views of those most like myself and thus quells cognitive dissonance) color my evaluation. How do I do that? Learning to recognize fallacies doesn't seem to be enough, because I know plenty of people on both sides of the American political divide who are brilliant at exposing flaws in arguments that have the ""wrong"" conclusions, but often fail apply the same rigor to arguments that affirm their positions.

These are my thoughts...,jw255,308,59,130,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/v8ml0/i_was_invited_to_church_by_some_baptist_friends_i/,"I am an atheist. I was not raised religious and have not been to many religious buildings or gatherings. I don't celebrate religious holidays in a religious context, nor do I practice any religious rituals. These are my thoughts on my first church visit in years. I'm writing this to share my experience, but also to provide some insight to people who have never been to a church. I'm also hoping that people who have or do go to church can chime in and let me know if this is typical of their experience or if they've experienced something different.


My biggest take away was that the church was basically Circlejerk City. It was a one hour ad for the Church. Keep the faith, keep spreading the word, and keep on giving us your money.


I wonder how things would go if there was an actual intellectual debate at church rather than just mental masturbation.


I'm just going to write in point form as I don't have time to make sure my English is perfect.



The Building:

- seemed extravagant and impressive

- had no air conditioning

- looks like it costs a lot to maintain

- the high ceiling certainly does give the illusion that you are there to worship something that is above you



The People:

- all super nice

- kids were playing with each other

- adults were networking and gossiping



The Songs:

- there were a bunch of songs throughout the service...I think they sang 4 or 5 times

- the songs sounded good and weren't THAT offensive, although they were all very delusional

- the whole time, I kept thinking that these songs are like ads...like that Simpson's episode with the smoking commercial (""Are you smoking yet?"")

- the guy leading the songs was overly cheerful...so much so that it seemed like fake joy...cheesy



The Offering:

- they talked about giving to the church and holding fundraisers etc

- they did the whole offering thing...which was super awkward...the girl practically shoved the plate into my face

- most people didn't donate...some people placed their money inside an envelope...others gave cheques...one lady gave jewelry



The Scripture:

- OH, THE CHERRY PICKING! IT BURNS!!!

- they read verses that were basically circle jerk material (""Jesus is love, praise God, the Lord our Savior, etc"".....)

- all the verses were reinforcement type material...very vanilla

- nothing even remotely controversial or intellectual

- one of the pastors actually talked about more controversial topics, like children suffering in 3rd world countries, but then flipped it to ""we need to help them find Jesus"" and read another circlejerk verse.



The Conclusion:

So my take is that church is basically a marketing tool for religion and like all ads, they embellish and show you the tip of the iceberg. They obviously don't want to promote any intellectual thought, because who wants to analyze what they're selling and reveal the truth if the truth is ugly. God is love, the church is good, the Bible is perfect, and please give us your money.



EDIT 1: formatting



EDIT 2: Crap! I forgot one of the main points.

&gt;As an atheist, I'm completely undecided as to what happens to consciousness after death. If it exists now, what is to stop it reforming some other time? I don't think it's correct to say that anybody ""knows"" what happens after death. We just don't know.

Followed by:
&gt;Keep speaking up; I'm tired of godlessness being associated with finite existence. I am a militant, anti-theist, atheist, but I do believe we will realize another form of existence when we die. Whether it be through our own recreation from an incomprehensibly advanced human civilization, or the realization that we have already once existed; the infinite expanse of time and space lead me to believe there will be something more. 

It's absolutely amazing to me to see things like this, and treated well. I see it as surrendering religion's comforting security net, only to replace it with another feel good fantasy--only this time secular.

There's a difference between philosophizing the unknown and grasping at an ideal rooted in religion, culture, and our innate desire to survive. I feel like this kind of thought falls upon the latter.

I don't think of myself as atheist, but many people would consider me functionally atheist. To the extent categories matter, I guess I would categorize myself as a mythical, big-tent Christian. It would probably be more accurate to say I am a rational golden rule-ist.

My home is largely religious. My wife is Mormon (I used to be, long story), and we and the kids all go to church together pretty much weekly. I view it as a family activity and don't mind going (most weeks). My wife is very devout. A lot of my words and actions are very un-Mormon but I haven't had a totally open conversation about it with the kids (our oldest is 11). 

Now to the point. My 11 year old son (12 in October, raised completely Mormon), thinks God hates him. He often will have emotional breakdowns practically because I think the way he sees it is that if God controls everything, then God must hate him when things go bad. He can get really emotional and worked up about it. 

From my perspective, I want to tell him, ""Son, the most important thing is your health—physical, emotional, and spiritual. If you truly believe God hates you, let's try to find a way you can think of God differently and it's okay if you stop believing in God altogether if that will help you be more healthy emotionally. There is room in this family for any belief or no belief. The more important thing is our emotional health, not beliefs.""

I guess I feel like his religious upbringing is starting to have some negative emotional consequences and I think that the supposedly loving Christian God, if there is one, would rather His children not believe in him if it was causing them a lot of pain. How can I let my son know that it's okay for him to believe or not believe in whatever he wants?

Any thoughts?

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the responses. I've read every single one and you've given me a lot of excellent feedback. As many have mentioned, I'm working on two fronts—my wife and my son. It's been a few years since I've stopped being Mormon, and while she is still totally devout, she is not as hardcore as many are in the church. For that I'm thankful. Still though, I know that should any of our kids not turn out Mormon she'll feel like a total failure and she'll blame me (at least initially).

(I don't want to make this about that particular event, or use it to prove an 'Atheist Agenda, It just happens to be what got this thought ticking over in my mind).

There are So Many comments like, ""These girls are free after 10 years being kidnaped, Thank God!"" The obvious question has been put forth buy many on /r Atheism have pointed out- 'Why Thank god, where was he for the 10 years they were being kidnapped and Raped?'. No big Revelation there, but it got me thinking about what a Christian might respond with, and I imagine many would say 'It's all part of God's Plan.""

It's this idea that has got me thinking. 

*If everything that happens, both good and Bad, is part of his plan- why thank him?
*For that matter if you are going to Thank a man for 1 act of good, then why would you NOT condemn or criticize him for the 100 terrible acts? 

Basically what I'm asking is if everything is 'Part of God's Plan'  (As Christians often say) then why thank him for the good bits and refuse to Chastise him for the Bad bits? surely You would either Do BOTH or neither?

**Oh And despite mentioning /r Atheism I asked HERE because I was hoping for more of a discussion- rather then just Christian-Bashing.

## The more I read responses trying to explain how people Thanking God think, the more it sound like they are just thanking god for finally deciding to take action. ""Thank God, you finally decided to step in a help!"" I think I'm getting even more cynical on this subject.

Also, they did something similiar on [March 8th](http://www.catholic.com/radio/calendar/2013-03) in case anyone wants to listen to how that show went.  Just click on the podcast for that date to listen to it.

Second segment at minute 45.  The caller actually made the guest speaker(the guy that isn't the host) talk about something I've never heard before, ""actuality and potentiality"" or something like that.  Basicially who uses this to avoid the logical fail of ""everything has a cause except the first cause."" 

Second segment at minute 23.  I like the caller, he brought up good points, and he is honest and uses his reason and logic well.  He is an atheist.  Why is he an atheist?  Well, because the bible really doesn't make sense. (hehe)  He says he is not an educated man and barely literate(I forgot whether he says he has no college degree or no high school degree.  I think he says he has no college degree)  I love the callers honesty, he says that he has a bible, he has tried to ""feel something"" but nothing.  He says his heard of literal and non-literal reading of the bible, and he says honestly, that is confusing, and so many people don't even know what to  believe.   He also asks both hosts how they arrived at believing in god.  This was interesting to me, as I always like to hear their reason.  They go no to talk about this for a little while, but eventually, the hosts says ""well at some point I felt that god was intervening in my intellectual journey"" or something to that effect.  This is what I was expecting, it is always some kind of emotion that ""converts"" them.  It it always some sort of appeal to emotion.

I listen to this station sometimes, specifiaclly this show (I think I am a masochist).  Actually, most of the time, it is always the same old religious believe because god blah blah blah.

Explains why Christians and other theists are afraid of atheism.

Deconstructs the character of God (that is, *why* God acts the way he does) as depicted in the Old &amp; New Testaments. It also explains possible origins and motivations behind the creation of the Judeo-Christian myth/narrative. This one is, in my opinion, the most enjoyable read.

A year ago she told me she'd visited some church and she'd liked it. She said as an atheist she regrets that she misses out on all the non-crazy things religion offers such as perdy churches, the sense of community and sermons on morality or what not. Being the good atheist Redditor I am I was very sceptical and didn't like it that she ""supported"" the evil religion of Christianity by going there, even if she doesn't believe. Never heard much more of it and she didn't end up going again.

Then a few days ago she was going on her second visit and wanted me to come with. I was very sceptical but I thought what the hell. It might make a fun experiment. What I experienced was nothing like what I'd expected.

The priest held a sermon about the golden rule and it was actually very touching and thought provoking. The whole sermon was very secular in nature. Not so much blah blah the glory of god as an intelligent conversation on morality and the plight of the human condition. He talked about how the golden rule exists in almost all religions. How there is no need for complex doctrine and dogma and how silly it is for people to act out in violence over differences in religion. How you need to allow yourself to love and forgive yourself as well as others for their shortcomings, and try to always meet people halfway. How you must fight against us and them thinking. It was quite frankly awesome. Every once in a while he'd mention Jesus and I'd cringe and kind of remember that, oh right, this is a Christian church I'm sitting in after all. But overall, really good! And throughout this church visit it dawned on me that most of the people there, perhaps even the priest, were not really Christians but rather some generic fuzzy blend of deists, agnostics or generic ""theists"" who simply gathered around Christianity because the framework was already there. I think this is how most of the sane religious people work. They don't necessarily buy the specific doctrine, but rather just believe in some kind of undefined spirituality and use the established church as a retreat for a quiet moment of reflection away from the stress of modern day society.

This was a Swedish church of course and I know you Americans out there have it a lot more difficult. But insofar as I'm trying to make some kind of point here (mostly just wanted to share my experience) it is that religion doesn't have to be a poison of pure evil and the secular world might even have a thing or two to learn from religion, as crazy as that sounds. My dream scenario is that people would not need to go to religious churches because there was a secular alternative. Sadly there is no such alternative today.

Fair enough; I try to do my fair share of calling fellow believers out. But when I do this, I am then in turn often called out on the ""No True Scotsman""-fallacy. Why is this?

When I call out Christians on having non-Christian attitudes and acting in a way that goes against Christ, how is that fallacious? For example, when Christ teaches to turn the other cheek and then exhorts his followers to do as he says (eg. Luke 6:46 ""Why do you call me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ and do not do what I say?""), what is wrong with calling out Christians on either their own violence or their support of (state-sanctioned) violence and war, or other behavior that is not condoned by Christ? Why should I (or anyone else) give credence to fundamentalist notions of what being ""Christian"" consists of, when it so clearly goes against how Christ told us to act?

In my experience this fallacy is misattributed far too often. And it seems like whatever I do (call fellow Christians out or keep silent), atheists disapprove of it. I can't please everyone, but it just doesn't seem fair in this case.

What I really want to know is how to support her. Right now she is as militant as any convert to Christianity I’ve ever seen. She talks about it all the time, all discussions relate to it etc. I know this is normal due to her age and the discovery of something new that’s awesome. 

Background: We ourselves are not religious, but more spiritual. We didn’t really go to church, and have often had lively discussions about the differences in religions and doctrines and beliefs while she was growing up. Some of them are fine, some are filled with crazy, just like everything else. The rest of the family on her dad’s side is definitely more religious, and we live in one of the buckles of the Bible belt (Alabama). My side is a bit more relaxed, but we have a few more religious folks around. She met a guy (they’ve been together about a year) who is an atheist, and I’m sure that their discussions solidified her thoughts.

How do I help her to know when to bite the bullet and smile, and when to defend herself? I’m not ashamed, I’m not angry and though she is a bit aggravated I won’t come to her way of thinking (this is the biggest issue we’ve ever disagreed on), she’s slowly coming to terms with not having to have her dad and I think the same way she does. Most of the articles I’ve found have dealt with being a Christian parent and how to get your child back into the fold, or an atheist parent losing a child.  But I can’t find anything that seems to fit this situation.  

Any advice and help is appreciated.

I can't remember the title, but the story was something about Mary being impregnated by aliens and Jesus was half alien.  It was the story of his adventures.  It was pretty funny.

After the first showing, there was a group of people from a local Christian cult protesting outside.  When I left the theatre, one guy got in my face and twice yelled in outrage ""WERE THEY MAKING FUN OF GOD??!""

I calmly asked him if God was infinite, and he said yes.  I asked him if for any and every thing we can do, God can do it better, and he said yes.

I then told him that I found the show hilarious, and God, who must have an *infinitely* better sense of humour than me, no doubt appreciated it even more.  Then I asked him if *he thought* God's sense of humour could be infinite, or if God just wouldn't really ""get"" the show.  

He decided God probably would really like the show, and he went off to tell his fellow protesters.  The next night, there were no protesters.

The Messiah is a person who will live up to a series of prophetic expectations and partake of an era marked by particular characteristics. In absence of such being the case, Jesus cannot possibly be the Messiah. 

&gt;The whole world will worship the One God of Israel. Isaiah 2:11-17, Isaiah 40:5, Zephaniah 3:9

Currently large swaths humanity do not worship the One God of Israel. 

&gt;Knowledge of God will fill the world. Isaiah 11:9, 45:23, 66:23, Jeremiah 31:33, Zechariah 3:9, 8:23, 14:9,16, Ezekiel 38:23, Psalm 86:9

Note that this is *knowledge* of God - not simply unsubstantiated faith in God. Even amongst the faithful, such knowledge is rare. 

&gt;All Israelites will be returned to their homeland Isaiah 11:12, 27:12-13, Ezekiel 11:17, 36:24, Deuteronomy 30:3

Though there are more Jews today living in the Land of Israel than there have been since the exile began nearly 2,000 years ago - there is still a large diaspora consisting of millions of Jews. 

&gt;The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness. Isaiah 51:11

The Jewish people have been historically subject to a great degree of persecution (the Holocaust, the Inquisition, pogroms, etc.) and while generally our condition has improved, we are still a perpetual target. 

&gt;Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel. Isaiah 52:13-53:5

While modern Germany as a nation-state does much to repent of its history (i.e. the Holocaust), various states and human institutions with much blood and guilt on their hands, to this day either remain silent, white-wash/cover up history, or in some perverse instances even exult in it. 

&gt;The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance. Zechariah 8:23

While there is today an emerging interest in observance of the Noahide laws (the Torah's universal laws of man), there still has not been an en masse turn towards learned Torah observant Jews for guidance in spiritual matters.

&gt;Weapons of war will be destroyed. Ezekiel 39:9

One need only momentarily consider the trillions spent on arms by nations such as the U.S., China and Russia as well as the existence of an immense military industrial complex to realize that this is not the condition we find ourselves in today. 

&gt;A person’s genealogical/tribal membership are transmitted exclusively through one’s physical father. Numbers 1:18, Jeremiah 33:17

Jesus whose alleged sketchy genealogy is maternal cannot possibly be a verifiable descendent of the tribe of Judah. 

&gt;The Temple will be rebuilt. Micah 4:1, Ezekiel 40-42, Isaiah 2:2-3, Malachi 3:4, Zechariah 14:20-21,

The Third Temple is not a metaphor, it is not symbolic of a man. There will be an actual physical building where all of the ritualistic components that the Torah commands be implemented, will be administered by Leviim (Levites) and Kohanim (Priests). 

&gt;World Peace: Isaiah 2:4, 11:6, 60:18 Micah 4:1-4, Hosea 2:20

The list of ongoing military conflicts is too long to list here. One can hardly pick up a newspaper or hear a news report without being informed of the latest battle, bombing, strike, etc. 

&gt;Christianity claims that Jesus ""Fulfilled the law,"" i.e. the law is abrogated and need not any longer be observed. 

Deut. 13:2-7 concerns the ""false prophet"" - if one arises who attempts to draw the Jewish people away from Torah observance then he is to be identified as such. The Torah's commandments are an eternally binding covenant with the Jews, God is not a whimsical being subject to a willy nilly changing of the rules - ""God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent"" (Num. 23:19)

&gt;All Jews will embrace Torah observance. Ezekiel 37:24, Deuteronomy 30:8-10, Jeremiah 31:32, Ezekiel 11:19-20, 36:26-27.

It is fairly obvious that as the situation stands today, lamentably only a very small percentage of Jews live in observance of the Torah. Secularism has widely been embraced by Jews and some even go so far as deeming such virtuous. 

&gt; Jesus cannot be a part of God, not him, anybody or anything. Deut 6:4. 

The idea of the Messiah actually partaking of divinity is anathema to Torah Judaism. God is ONE. His oneness is inviolable and is not that of a compound unity (like twelve eggs make one dozen, or three divinities make one god). 

&gt; The law is eternal.

Exodus 12:14, 12:17, 12:43, 27:21, 28:43, Leviticus 3:17, 7:36, 10:9, 16:29, 16:31, 16:34, 17:7, 23:14, 23:21, 23:31, 23:41, 24:3, Numbers 10:8, 15:15, 19:10, 19:21, 18:23, 35:29, Deuteronomy 29:28, and that there are no references to it ever passing away. 

To summarize ([H. Melakhim Ch. 11](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188356/jewish/Chapter-11.htm)): 

*In the future, the Messianic king will arise and renew the Davidic dynasty, restoring it to its initial sovereignty. He will build the Temple and gather the dispersed of Israel. Then, in his days, the observance of all the statutes will return to their previous state. We will offer sacrifices, observe the Sabbatical and Jubilee years according to all their particulars as described by the Torah...*

*If a king will arise from the House of David who diligently contemplates the Torah and observes its mitzvot as prescribed by the Written Law and the Oral Law as David, his ancestor, will compel all of Israel to walk in (the way of the Torah) and rectify the breaches in its observance, and fight the wars of God, we may, with assurance, consider him Moshiah. If he succeeds in the above, builds the Temple in its place, and gathers the dispersed of Israel, he is definitely the Moshiah. He will then improve the entire world, motivating all the nations to serve God together, as Tzephaniah 3:9 states: 'I will transform the peoples to a purer language that they all will call upon the name of God and serve Him with one purpose.' If he did not succeed to this degree or was killed, he surely is not the redeemer promised by the Torah.*

The Messiah will basically be a human religious leader and a warrior king born of a *young woman.* He will **not die and come back, rather he will live a mortal life within which he fulfill the prophetic expectations.** [Bar Kochba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kochba) (who led the rebellion against Roman occupation), was once considered as a messianic candidate. However, [once he died](http://imgur.com/a/N1kbb) and thus failed to live up to the aforementioned expectations, the Sages effectively shrugged and said ""oh well... he wasn't it."" To borrow a phrase ""The God of the Hebrew Bible sends the messianic king to accomplish his end, not to follow a two-part script in which the hero tragically dies and the words 'to be continued' suddenly appear on the screen.""

I apologize for the grammar.

The biggest problem I have with anti-theism is that I don't believe if religion were abolished magically over night everything would be magically better. We still would have the same issues that anti-theists blame on religion.  Bigotry, undeserved moral absolutism, extremism, pseudoscience, misogyny, disregard for reason, etc. would all still be around without religion.

Sure humankind couldn't use religion for a guise for these blights, but they sure would find something else that would work just as well. Bad science, bad politics, nationalism, pure old fashioned racism, etc etc. Most of the things that anti-theists claim as a negative of religion, don't require religion at all.

The problem as I see it, isn't religion.  It's tribalism.  By tribalism I mean anything that can cause an ""us vs. them"" attitude.  Anything at all that takes away from seeing ourselves as the ""human community"".  Tribalism is an inherit part of human nature, and abolishing that is a much harder problem than abolishing religion. 

I also think that's why there are people that see /r/atheism as such a hypocritical community.  They see that they participate in the same tribalism as religion does. Perhaps on some level these accusers of hypocrisy realize the real problem as well, and therefore see the same faults in the community they see in religion.

In conclusion, anti-theism doesn't seem to solve any of the problems it claims to be against.  It only exacerbates the tribalism between two different groups, while lowering the threshold for people crossing over, only attracting those that have already disassociated themselves from one tribe (religion), and were looking to attach themselves to another tribe.

Furthermore, I don't want to add offer any ways to solve the tribalism issue. I feel it's a very non-trivial thing to figure out.  We'd have to change how humanity's brains work.

**tl;dr**: The problems isn't religion, it's tribalism.

-----

I've been listening to Sam Harris' audiobooks, particularly segments on neuroscience, cognition, thought and free will.

The fact that conscious thought is preceeded by unconscious prefactors blows my mind. Depending on the action or thought you are about to have, the unconscious part of your brain has already formulated it 300-700 milliseconds prior. Some motor actions can be detected 7-10 full seconds before you do them.

There is still a tendency in me to say ""oh, this must be proof of a soul, and the cusp of interaction between the spiritual and the material.""

Which, of course, is bullshit. Just because *I* don't have all the answers on a topic, it doesn't mean that someone else hasn't discovered it. And just because the truth of something hasn't been discovered yet, it doesn't mean that it won't be discovered at some future date.

Yet the ease, and often eagerness, to fill existing gaps with God still persists, even in skeptical minds. You just have to keep reminding yourself that each ""filling"" will have to be embarrasingly extricated once a real answer has been found.

It's kind of depressing to think that one would have a tendency to keep ""falling off the wagon"" like that. It could only imagine this is what former heroin addicts go through, minus the vomiting and hair loss.

We lived hundreds of miles away, so we only saw them on occasional holidays, and when I was a teenager I think we only visited once or twice - I didn't know him well then.

Fast forward a decade - I'm getting married, I visit my family, I'm getting to know them better now that I'm an adult and control my own travels. Fast forward a couple of years into my marriage and I realize I'm an atheist - I hadn't particularly remembered my Grandfather's atheism because he didn't talk much about his personal opinions. After my Grandma passed away last year, we learned she didn't want a minister or a service at all - she agreed to a small family gathering and that's it. She believed that when you died, you decomposed and gave what was left of your life back to the earth.

I tried talking with him about being an atheist a month or so ago - I had called him and we chatted about a few things, and he sounded like he was ready to get off of the phone (never really cared much to talk for long) when I mentioned my non-belief in passing as it was vaguely relevant to whatever it was we were talking about. We ended the conversation without any discussion about it.

I haven't spoken to him since then - maybe it's been even longer, maybe it's been 2 or 3 months. I don't know. I wish I'd called more often. Yesterday he thought he was having a heart attack... they discovered it was an aneurysm in his heart and that no matter what, he was on borrowed time. 48 hours in hospice or surgery with a lengthy recovery and rehab process were his options - he chose the surgery and his (supposed) last words were, ""I'm not going to any damn rehab.""

I looked up to my Grandparents very much as I got to know them. I wish that they had been in better health... the time that I did get to spend getting to know them as an adult is time that I value and cherish.

1354829047.0,213,self.TrueAtheism,14el8n,I was asked if I thought the DNA evidence and human genome disproved the Bible by a Christian friend. This was my response:,PureMath86,262,49,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/14el8n/i_was_asked_if_i_thought_the_dna_evidence_and/,"To answer your question from the other day more directly, I would like to say:

Genetics has proven the Adam and Eve story to be purely a myth. Without the Adam and Eve story there is no 'Original Sin.' Without 'Original Sin' there is no need for 'Salvation.' Without a need for 'Salvation' there is no need for 'Jesus.' Without 'Jesus' there is no Christianity.

The whole of the religion is built on a story that did not happen. All the evidence contradicts it --100% of the genetics, fossils, cosmology, etc.

This particular narrative, like all other religious myths, is full of good things --placed there by their human creators. But there is no denying, given the evidence, that it is a human construct. It is prone to corruptibility and flaws. But it has a key feature. It satisfies our need to understand the world around us --it provides us with a narrative-- it yields a sense of purpose.

But a more realistic approach is to be scientific, not to abandon reason in the face of refuting evidence. If you get rid of religion, all the same questions are still there: What is my responsibility to my fellow man? How should I live my life? What is the best way to build a society? And the quintessential question: How can I determine the answer to these things?

The religious answer is always one of divine revelation --dictation-- fascism. The scientific answer is always one of reason. It may mean that you have to approximate the result before all the information is in --before there is a sufficient amount of evidence collected. But I'd rather be partially right and open to better explanations than to purport a failed hypothesis --one that is demonstrably false.

Ethics is something like this. The ethics of the Old Testament are horrible. The ethics of the New Testament are much better. This is not a testament to our 'creator' or to his divine 'grace,' but to our own ingenuity and growth. However, to say that even this is a perfect system is ridiculous. We can do better --and we should not accept what we are given just because of the 'authority' of the source, if it does not conform to reason and withstand evidence. For example, the views on women and homosexuals are lacking merit.

So in my personal opinion, this is the religious endgame. While it is true that I cannot disprove the existence of some undefined, arbitrary deity, I can demonstrate things that are contradictory and would refute the existence of 'particular' deities. Jesus Christ for example is easy to refute with actual evidence (not biblical myths about what the historical figure supposedly said or did). Jehovah is even easier --he does not possess an absolute moral code but the claims are that he does.

So where does this leave us? Well, it leaves those who care about the answers to the questions we are still left with only one way to reach those answers. Second, it frees us up to focus solely on those things and not on some imagined order and some imagined will of some imagined dictator. Last, it leaves us with a responsibility to our fellow man --and in light of the potential and actual horrors of religion --its stifling effect on the use of reason and the accepting of truth, not to mention all the heinous crimes it permits and in many cases commands... it is of dire importance that we combat it. 

[TL;DR --Yes...]

**Edit.**

*I should mention that we had already discussed how there would be genomic evidence and mitochondrial DNA evidence if the human population had bottle-necked down to two individuals in the past 6-10,000 years --namely, Adam and Eve (not to mention the Flood fiasco).*

*I should mention that I am not a biologist by profession, but neither is my friend. However, I consult with many biologists in my science department (I'm a mathematician). My friend is a youth minister of a local church and we get into these discussions all the time. He is a very kind fellow and somewhat intelligent (my expectations are low in the Bible Belt). But he often makes slanderous and ludicrous remarks concerning Cosmology and Evolution, which as a scientist I find quite disturbing and harmful to his very young audience.*

I'll turn it into a blog some day, but in the meantime, it seemed worth sharing.)




&gt; Hey, Dad.

&gt; I wanted to expand on our phone call the other day so you could understand better where my morality comes from.

&gt; I think we hit on an important point when you said that you do good because you love God, rather than because you fear hell.  It's important that you recognize that fear of hell is not necessary for a person to act morally, just as fear of punishment is not necessary for a person to obey the law.  There are many crimes I could almost certainly get away with, such as pirating music.  I don't, though, because I believe that musicians deserve to make money from their labor.  It's not the fear of punishment that keeps me from pirating music, it's my principles based on my understanding of goodness: of what qualities make an action good, and of what qualities make a person good.

&gt; I think Christians are stuck on the horns of dilemma: is God good only because he defines what good is, or is he good because the things he does--the things he encourages and supports--are good in themselves?  In other words, does God define ""good"" arbitrarily, or does he have a reason for saying that certain things are good?  

&gt; Do you remember that episode of *Friends* where Joey needed money, and Chandler wanted to give it to him, but Joey refused to take charity?  Chandler invented a card game called ""Cups"" that had arbitrary rules he thought up on the spot so he would ""lose"" money to Joey.  You weren't surprised when Chandler managed to ""lose"" exactly the amount of money he intended to give to Joey: Chandler made the rules, so of course he did what he set out to accomplish when he invented the game.

&gt; If God arbitrarily defined what ""good"" is, then morality is really just a cosmic game of ""Cups"" that he created.  Whatever end he had in mind when he defined the rules of ""good"", we should not consider him skillful or praiseworthy for having accomplished it: he made the rules!  You or I or any moderately intelligent child could invent a game like that: it's as easy as ""Let's flip a coin: heads I win, tails you lose!""

&gt; If you want to say ""God is good"" and have it mean anything at all, it must mean that there exists some definition of ""good"" by which God's character can be evaluated.  If you want ""God is good"" to be a real praise, ""good"" must have some independent meaning which God is praiseworthy for acting in accordance with.  If ""good"" is just some arbitrary set of rules that God selected, saying ""God is good"" is not really worship at all: you're just saying ""God acts in accordance with the arbitrary rules he defined.""  You may as well be praising Chandler for following the ""rules"" of Cups.[1]

&gt; This is a dilemma.  You have two choices here.  You can say ""God defines what good is"" and make it meaningless when you say ""God is good"".  We'll call that strategy ""biting the bullet"", and I believe it's the tack you've taken in our earlier discussions.  Alternatively, you can say ""There exists some independent standard of good which God perfectly communicates to us and perfectly fulfills in himself"".  That's the position I always took as a believer, and that's the same position I take now: that good is something defined outside and apart from God.  But once you admit that ""good"" is some standard outside of God, then you have to admit that I, an atheist, can strive for that standard without any belief in God.

&gt; If you truly believe that God defines ""good"" by his command, then we have very little to talk about when it comes to morality.  Your beliefs entail that God could say ""Rape is good"" and rape would actually be good.  I don't believe that rape could ever be good, even if God said it was good.  If God claimed that rape was good, I wouldn't worship him even if I knew he was all-powerful and could send me to hell.  If you actually believe that God can say of any arbitrary act, ""This act is good"", then you're just a step away from some very heinous acts, and that's scary.

&gt; [1] It seems clear that we shouldn't praise Chandler for accomplishing his ends with the game of Cups, because he made the rules.  But there's another interesting question: should we praise Joey for following the rules of Cups?  All Joey knew about the rules of Cups, he learned from Chandler, who made the rules arbitrarily.  Is it praiseworthy to act in accordance with completely arbitrary rules?  If God flipped a coin to decide the rules of morality, would we really be praiseworthy for following those rules?  I contend that not only is it meaningless to say ""God is good"" if God defines morality, but it's meaningless to say anyone is praiseworthy if God defines morality.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1gs8i8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1gs8i8/god_good_and_chandlers_game_cups/,

I was raised as a southern baptist, I was even an intern Youth Pastor for awhile. I understand most of the ""Christian"" responses to most atheist postulations. But the way I was raised has led me to believe that christianity does not hold the answers. I understand that the problem of evil  (So well summed up by Harris in the God debate part 2) is a large hole in the Christian worldview. I also understand that Evolution is extremely well supported and flys in the face of biblical innerancy. 

I find myself at a difficult point in life, I live in Lynchburg, VA with my wife. Thankfully she shares most of my views that the religion we have been raised in is probably not the correct way. Lynchburg is the home of liberty university for those who don't know; so there are very few people around here to consult with. I've read many books on both sides (I even attended liberty for a few years so I understand the super christian view)

I guess I'd like to state my views and ask a few questions and if anyone can help guide me a little more, I would greatly appreciate it.

I feel I have a good handle on what makes christianity false, but I am confused as to the atheistic response. I understand what it's like to be an atheist in regards to 99% of world religions, but I also have the dichotomy in my head of knowing the christian response to most of atheisms ideas. 

For the record I would call myself an atheist but I have a few hang ups that are causing me to continue to question...

First, one of the biggest PROOFS christianity offers is irreducible complexity. This was pushed so hard while I was in school and I've read several books on the christian side of it that state that this is an insurmountable stumbling block for evolution and is a huge win for creationism. What is the naturalistic response to this?

Second, I know that athesim pokes a lot of holes in biblical contradictions. However there is a branch of christianity called apologetics which says that bible verses, when understood in the concept of the time that they were written ARE infallible and therefore not contradictory.  Mostly they claim that OT verses can be dismissed as cultural if they don't make sense in the modern setting, but the moral verses about how to mak certain life decisions are relevant today. Is there a logical counter argument to this?

THe other rebuttal I here when discussing my beliefs is usually an oversimplification of ""How can you say a primordial soup struck by lightning created life?"" Is there a better way to explain this?

I'm sorry if my writing comes off as disjointed. I really appreciate help on this as I feel I'm in a scary place in my life, departing from the beliefs and ways I  have been conditioned to live my life for 20 odd years. I would say my real departure from christianity started about 3 years ago when I joined the army and only recently after discussing it with my wife have I really started to verbalize and define it.

A special thank you to cypherpunks for his incredibly wonderful analogy and to both Loki's who linked some very useful videos. 

At this point, I would have to say that in my head I would call myself an atheist, it is just a scary proposition to let that slip out because a majority of my friends and family are super baptists. It almosts feels dishonest to let them continue believing what they do about me, but I wouldn't want to cause them strife.

I made a passing comment about how many American civilians get killed by terrorism around the world every year, and what mundane things we're actually more likely to get killed by.

My dad agreed with me, but then veered it into a conversation about how one of his pastors recently told him a statistic that Christians are martyred every 12 seconds around the world.  He then went on to tell me 2-3 anecdotes of recent Christian persecution cases from his pastor, most all of which dealt with the Middle East, and no one dying.  He also noted in his military experience (28 years, Lt. Col) how they had to make camouflage bibles when they sent people in the Middle East, but he framed in the context of martyrdom and religious freedom.

The first thing I thought when he was telling me this was, 'what does this have to do with the news sensationalizing terrorism?'  But this modern Christian worldwide martyrdom thing was pretty novel to me, so I got really interested despite my immediate doubts, especially with a statistic thrown in (I know the Christian persecution complex is definitely not new though).

In order to legally register your religion, your group must agree to these terms. If you do not agree, then your organization will not be registered as a religion.

* A religion may not use the death penalty as a punishment for not joining the religion. It cannot be suggested out loud, and it cannot be written in your holy book.

* A religion may not use the death penalty as a punishment for leaving the religion. It cannot be suggested out loud, and it cannot be written in your holy book.

* A religion may not subordinate one gender to another.

* A religion may not accept new members until the age of 18.

* A religion may not ask its members to make oaths or promises without explaining them to the member in full and in writing, and giving the member at least 30 days to consider the requirements of the oath and discuss it with whom they wish. As an example, the Mormon church requires members to commit to the Law of Consecration in the Temple ceremony, where the pledge all of their money, property, possessions, and time to the LDS Church. They have no warning, and upon hearing the oath, they have fewer than 30 seconds to make the choice. They are sworn to secrecy about the oath.

* A religion must pay taxes on the products, goods, and services it uses. If your god is true, then he/she will help you overcome this.

* A religion may not donate money or volunteer labor to any lobbying organization or to any political officials or political actions or legislation.

* A religion may try to explain the origin of the universe and explain the nature of the universe, but must accept that public schools must only teach what is observable and provable.

First off, born and raised Mormon. So is the wife. We haven't believed in years but due to crushing societal pressures, we are biding our time. This is merely background, not the story itself.

My wife has had many chronic health problems - generalized fatigue and pain, chronic back problems stemming from a cracked vertebrate from her childhood which was left untreated, etc. TL;DR - she is in a lot of pain.

A neighbor came to our house one day and told her ""I heard you have some health issues. I know a guy who can help you."" Being a Skeptoid/SWAK fan, this aroused my suspicions.

She went to the neighbor's home where the ""party"" was. A confidence man came in and started pitching DoTerra Essential Oils. 

The claims were:

* natural, pure, essential oils are the cure to all of life's diseases

* you can be your own doctor

* Big Pharma is pumping us all full of toxic chemicals

* doctors don't care about helping you

* become a distributor, with a monthly monetary commitment, and you can get people to become distributors under you

She walked home with $200 worth of oils, books, and vaporizers. She started trying to treat our kids' earaches, headaches, scratches, coughs, and sneezes with magic oil. She tried pressing our friends and family to join.

I become consumed - I started looking more deeply into Alt Med and Multi-Level-Marketing scams. I came to these conclusions about what they all had in common:

* The product is revival of practice of an old, dead religion

* All diseases and depression come from a single source (lack of the product)

* All diseases and depression are cured from a single source (the product)

* The product works in a way that is above the laws of nature

* The product cannot be tested or proven the same way evil scientists prove their poison methods

* You will become rich by selling the product to others - all you have to do is believe and keep on pushing

* It is your fault if you don't become rich - you just didn't believe it hard enough

* You need to attend the weekly seminars and attend the potlucks and social events so you can progress

* The business needs to be an integral part of your family

-----

I realized just how abusive and evil Alt Med and MLMs are, and the fallacies they employed made me sick. I tried calling the State Attorney's office and other enforcement agencies, but they could offer no help.

I wanted to find a way to take down the companies pushing Alt Med.

In addition to the skepticism I already had against religion, I realized that EVERYTHING that Alt Med pushed, and the MLMs that backed it, were exactly how religion works today.

Pretty much overnight I went from a skeptic to an anti-theist.

* Religion is its own product.

* All disease and unhappiness comes from lack of religion.

* All disease and unhappiness is cured by religion.

* Religion works in a way that is above the laws of nature

* Religion cannot be tested or proven the same way evil scientists prove things

* You will become rich (in heaven) by selling the product to others - all you have to do is believe and keep on pushing

* It is your fault if you don't become rich or become healed or happy - you just didn't believe it hard enough

* You need to attend the weekly church and attend the potlucks and social events so you can progress

""I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me. I think also understanding that Jesus Christ dying for my sins spoke to the humility we all have to have as human beings, that we're sinful and we're flawed and we make mistakes, and that we achieve salvation through the grace of God. But what we can do, as flawed as we are, is still see God in other people and do our best to help them find their own grace. That's what I strive to do. That's what I pray to do every day. I think my public service is part of that effort to express my Christian faith.""

With someone with such a well-rounded worldview, I can't help but think he's a closet atheist, who publicly affiliates as a christian for political purposes. An atheist socialist president would be the equivalent of Stalin in the eyes of many, so I think this statement is just to maintain his approval ratings. I kind of hope he really is an atheist. I worry about about the conflict between Israel and Iran, and I want to believe that before my president starts dropping bombs, he knows exactly what he's destroying.

I've had this question bothering me for a while now, and I didn't know who or how to ask it. So here goes...

I'm a religious person (Jewish, Modern Orthodox) and I'm just out of high school. I went to a religious high school, where certain standards of behavior were expected and followed. 

This summer, I'm working at a pool. My co-workers are high-schoolers and college students. And all they talk about is partying, drinking, drugs--things that are in many cases illegal and in all cases completely foreign to the sheltered way I've been living. 

Now, I know that I can't judge the entire outside world based on these five or six people, but the stories they're constantly telling--and the fact that they talk about this stuff literally all the time--freaks me out. I've always been interested in secular college (next year I'm taking a gap year to pursue religious studies, but I want to go into microbiology or bioengineering), but this makes me want to reconsider. Which freaks me out; I don't want to hide from the outside world. 

So--my question is: how typical is this? In the ""real world,"" what is considered ""wild"" or ""inappropriate""? 

And more philosophically--without religious restrictions, what shapes your behavior into these standards? This is the question that's really been nagging at me. 

Obviously this is a kind of wacky and overly general question. But if anybody would like to take a crack at it, I would be glad.

*I want to share my discussion with a Catholic priest when he came over to visit us at the house in which I live.  We talked extensively about the interpretation of the bible.  I hope you guys enjoy. Yes, I am a atheist.*

A Catholic priest came to bless the house in which I live yesterday and we had a very interesting conversation, which I would like to share with you guys. I don't see any practical use in blessing a house, but since it is not mine, I can't really object. Nevertheless, this visit from the priest has expanded my knowledge about his religion. I apologize in advanced if this gets long, but I really want to share my experience and hope that someone finds this interesting and/or worthwhile.

The priest arrived and my mom called me from my room to come greet him. I did and we just sat there and talked about music and sports for a while. He is a very nice guy over all. Then my mom broke the ice by telling him that I am an atheist and that I don't believe god exists. I know the Catholic religion does accept evolution as a fact, so I told him that my mom was very against the idea of evolution and to please affirm that his church accepts human evolution. He almost immediately said that they do, otherwise we wouldn't be the way we are, or something like that. My mom was pretty much speechless. Basically, after presenting the evidence and telling her that the pope John Paul II accepted evolution, she did not believe me, but after the priest told her that they do, she immediately changed her mind. They have so much power over people, eh! After that, we had a conversation that lasted for more than two hours.

We talked about many different topics that in a way helped me understand what they believe and why, and thus earning a bit more respect, but just a little bit since it is still a religion. All of this happened in presence of my mom, grandpa, and uncle, just so you know. I told him that it worries me that people in his church do not understand the bible and that they use it as a tool of hate as it is to condemn homosexuals. To that he said that the church offers various bible study groups to which sadly only about seven people show up. He also said that having a homosexual tendency is not sinful, but the actual sexual act is. To which I kinda just let go because it is simply worth talking about since my family quite homophobic and kinda thinks I'm gay because I defend gay rights. I am not gay by the way. This talk was mainly aimed, from my part, to help my mom understand her own religion better because she lacks a lot of knowledge about it. I started to list several things that obviously did not happen such as Noah's Ark and Adam and Eve. I really can't remember what he said the meaning of Noah's Ark was, but Adam and Eve he said that represented two cities that came into conflict with each other.  

We moved on to the topic of hell. I asked him if there was an unpardonable sin. He said that it is the sin against the holy spirit, which means that you deny salvation. I then asked if theoretically, a person as evil as Hitler had a deathbed conversion and accepted Jesus as lord as savior and asked for forgiveness would go to heaven. He said yes. I then asked that if a person who helps his/her community, feeds the hungry, clothes the nude, etc. but denied salvation would go to heaven if it were to exist. To that he said no and said that only those who want to be saved will be saved. I said that sure, that made sense, but that I just found it incredibly twisted that a mass murderer who had a deathbed conversion could be happy after death, if the afterlife existed, and I, an individual who could never kill a person and who tries to be helpful to other people would burn and suffer in hell for eternity and to that he said that hell has no fire. Hell has no fire??? Well, that is a new one for me, and many of you probably. Apparently hell is a place where you go to never see god. Never seeing god is your punishment. That really goes against the belief of the majority of people. I told him that who come I'm barely finding this out (my other family was pretty confused as well). He basically said that it was lack of study. Nevertheless, this conversation about hell concluded that I am still going to hell when horrible killers, rapists, and whatnot could live happily ever after with big brother up in a cloud. If there is an afterlife, that is.

Another thing about evolution I asked was that if Catholics accept evolution, how god chose when to come in and make us in his image. I was again struck with a new interpretation of that text. He said that that is not referring to our physical, but to our love and compassion to one another. He said that we resemble god in his love and that no one knows how he looks like, but that Jesus came as a man, so he obviously looks like one of us.

After I learned about these new interpretations, I told him that it is interesting that most people don't know this. I told him why lie to children about stories such as Noah's Ark, Adam and Eve, talking snake, etc. if they are not true. He said it is not lying, but that it is to introduce them and prepare them to learn the real stuff when they are ready. I was actually talking on the phone with my aunt this morning and I was telling her about this. She still believed that Noah's Ark, Adam and Eve, and that we were literally created the way god looks. She was so confused about all I told her, that she even asked if he was a real Catholic priest and not an impostor hahaha! She said that that was what she grew up with and was told by adults to believe. That goes to show that most people are very ignorant of their own religion and they keep teaching children things they know nothing about, or that new interpretations keep coming up.

It has been a positive experience, for the most part. I have met many friends, and I have a wonderful support system through this ministry. Over the last few months though, I have been feeling more and more like this is kind of a lie. I am at a turning point in my life where I either need to give myself over completely to Christianity, or drop it and move on. Basically, I need resources to make a decision.

Any fucking minute in fact.  And because I never received any feedback from God or Jesus when I prayed, I knew that even though I had prayed and asked Jesus to be the lord of my life and tried my best to live a good life, I knew that I could be wrong.  Wrong about the way I attempted to ""get saved"" and wrong about which church to go to and wrong about which god to even pray to.  It could turn out that God just punishes bad people and takes the truly good ones up to heaven, and I often felt like a bad person, largely because I was struggling with sexual thoughts and pornography ""addiction"" (what a bunch of bullshit, but yeah, that's what I was lead to believe by adults).

So, the point is, I spent my life in fear that the rapture/second coming of Christ would happen, and all my friends and family would be sucked up to heaven and I would be left on earth alone with nothing to think about but my own eternal impending doom in hell.  I believed so fervently in the pain and torture and torment and eternal nature of hell that this thought absolutely terrified my down to the deepest recesses of my bone marrow.  Once when my parents didn't come home from an errand (they were an hour or two later than their estimate) I actually went out in the yard and wailed and screamed at the top of my lungs and pleaded with God to please give me a second chance and don't send me to hell.  My parents got a call from my neighbors about my insane actions and rushed home to see what was the matter.  I didn't know how to explain.  This is just one of countless examples.  In fact when I lived near an airport for a year, every time a plane would fly over and I would hear it before I saw it I would think it must be the sky being ripped apart by king Jesus and all his trumpet-playing angel friends.  It is so ridiculous to recall now, but keep in mind this ended before I was 12.  Did anyone else have anything like a similar experience?

TL;DR I was a pretty paranoid kid and I lived a large part of my childhood in fear that I wasn't good enough for heaven and the rapture was going to happen and take all my friends and family to heaven and leave me behind to contemplate my eternal damnation.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_13mntw,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/13mntw/did_any_other_former_christians_live_at_least/,

I was in a military classroom and the subject of military history came up.  I mentioned that an Air Force captain in the 60s had flown in a weather balloon, jumped from around 100,000 ft and almost broke the sound barrier.  I couldn't remember his name at the time, but I saw it on a History Channel special.  The teacher called me out, saying he was on a team of weather scientists long ago and he knew the fastest a body can fall is terminal velocity, around 120 mph.  I countered that terminal velocity at low altitude was different than high altitude because of drag.  A body could accelerate first and then decelerate to terminal velocity.  I even used the whiteboard to diagram the thin/thick atmosphere.  He scoffed and said I didn't have his experience or knowledge and I was flat wrong.  He got the rest of the class in on the scoffing.  I stuck to my guns, even though a friend whispered that I was probably wrong and should shut up.

For weeks I was chided by my classmates and other teachers heard about the encounter.  When I tried to enter conversations, I was pretty much dismissed.  My papers came back with smarmy comments on them and low grades.  I held on to that anger for years.

Fast forward 15 years...  Felix Baumgartner beats Air Force Captain Joe Kittinger's freefall record, breaking the speed of sound.  I don't know if that teacher is still alive or remembers the shit he put me through, but I learned that even highly educated people will defer to authority, especially when they don't understand the issue or don't want to rock the boat.

Now that I'm an atheist, my christian wife and her side of the family have pretty much isolated me.  I've been told to keep my opinions to myself, not poison the children with worldly things, and so forth.  My wife refuses to even say 'I Love You' anymore.

I don't blame anyone for struggling with those pressures, as I still do and still will even after posting this.

In the past 25 years I went from Jewish to Monotheistic to Deistic to Agnostic to Atheist, with occasional skips and hops back and forth between the last three, sometimes as fluidly as all within the same day.

Why? A number of reasons. I like the idea of a sentient Higher Power looking out for humanity, dislike the idea that there's nothing for me after death, and sometimes think that humans are so remarkable, the richness and variety of our life so wide, that surely some Celestial Spark must have been placed in one of our ancestors sometimes in the past 10,000 years or so.

But while I can't help occasionally feeling those things, rationally there's just nothing left for me to hold on to: no arguments, no evidence, no matter how much I look and read and listen and debate.

Atheism is a ""dirty word"" in much of US society, and only exists because the majority of people are theists. No one calls themselves an a-astrologist, because most people don't seriously believe in astrology. But because the default for religion is flipped to ""on"" thanks to a world full of childhood religious indoctrination, we who left the fold must loosely label ourselves by the absence of a belief.

So why can't I call myself an agnostic anymore? It's nice and safe and inoffensive, isn't it? Atheism is just so **arrogant!**

Well here's the thing. Most agnostics say that their belief that God may exist boils down to a) the lack of evidence He doesn't exist, or b) the inherit mysteries of the universe. Not just that we don't know everything, but that He's potentially unverifiable, and therefor outside the purview of science or reason.

**The problem is, this can apply just as well to anything magical or mystical.**

Do I believe in magic? Primal spirits, like the life force of rocks/animals/the planet? Unicorns? Ghosts? These are things that may well exist outside our ability to observe/detect/test, just like God. I used to believe in many of these things, and am still open to the idea that they might exist.

But do I call myself an agnostic on those things? If someone asks me if they're true, do I say ""I don't know, there isn't enough evidence one way or the other?""

Most likely, no. Most people don't, in fact. If pressed I'll say I'm OPEN to the belief in them, but until evidence shows up I disbelieve.

This is exactly what the vast majority of atheists say about God.

To claim that ""asserting with 100% surety that there is no God is just as arrogant as claiming with 100% certainty that there is"" is a strawman itself. The vast majority of atheists, even those as ""militant"" as Richard Dawkins, will readily admit that they are not 100% sure of God's lack of existence. Only 99.9%, or 9.7/10, or some such.

Acknowledging two things is important here:

1) It's as impossible to pretend to disbelieve something you believe as it is to pretend to believe something you disbelieve. Meaning you can't just through a matter of willpower believe you are a mosquito: on some level, you know that you really are not a mosquito.

2) It's impossible to prove an unverifiable negative. I know this comes up a lot, but only because it's a monumentally important logical fallacy that many people fail to check against every aspect of their worldview.

But due to the ""Prove a Negative"" fallacy inherent in the argument of agnosticism, to say I'm an agnostic and not an atheist is to say I believe that God is **just as likely** to exist as anything else I can't prove doesn't exist, such as unicorns, leprechauns, ghosts, etc. Which is why ""agnostic deist"" or ""gnostic atheist"" are actual things, much more precise than the shorthand many use.

And while some people may well admit being agnostic on all of those things, the vast majority I've met will say no, they don't believe in unicorns, but on the issue of God they are agnostic. Which leaves God as a double-standard born of societal pressures, because we've been conditioned to treat religious beliefs differently.

Final points:

I know rain is the result of precipitation. Can it be more than that? Are there undetectable rain spirits also affecting whether rain falls? Not likely, but I have no idea. Should I then say that rain spirits might exist, even though I have no evidence of it?

Being open minded means being open to the **possibility**, but being informed and rational means basing beliefs on **probability**. If someone asks me if I think dragons exist, I don't say ""Maybe."" I say no, I don't think so, because there's no evidence or logic to support it. That doesn't mean I think they can't exist. Why should it be different for God?

In summation, due to social stigma, ""atheism"" is seen as an extreme view rather than the rational starting point (disbelief) of any unverifiable claim. We are all born atheists, just as we are born a-astrologists. But we live in a time and place where it's deviant to disbelieve in one of those things, but not the other, on purely inconsistent rationale.  And so, many people consider themselves agnostics, despite having just as little reason to believe in God as anything else they have no evidence of.

**TL;DR**: Under what criteria does a rational acknowledgement of lacking evidence support an unsupported theory?

Why should the perfectly reasonable ""I don't know what the truth is,"" get the addendum ""so maybe God?"" rather than ""maybe wizard?""  What reason or evidence besides cultural influence do you have to believe God is just as likely as any other hundred magical things you don't believe in without evidence?

Edits:

Thanks for all the responses. Two things I wanted to clarify:

1: Thanks to Wintershine for pointing out I misstated the point about disproving a negative.

2: I am aware of the ""agnostic as adjective"" spectrum of belief.  While technically correct, I don't find it particularly *useful* a labeling system.  Anyone who is gnostic about the existence of God, a being that by definition is able to do anything they God-damn want, including evade any and all scrutiny by puny mortals, just isn't thinking clearly.  So I consider almost everyone agnostic, even those who believe God exists with 100% purity, because they will quickly say ""Oh, well science can't prove He exists,"" which means ""nothing can"" as far as I'm concerned.  So I use ""agnostic"" as a noun, the way most people do, to identify their belief on God as being unsure/undecided.",,False,,t5_2soy6,1369590502.0,,,True,t3_19dzqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/19dzqf/why_calling_myself_an_agnostic_about_god_no/,

An argument with me sending them textual points for disbelief in a god (as he put it) and them discussing them in class.

I'm hesitant to do this for various reasons, so let's start by naming some:

* It's hardly a fair argument is it? I'm not present and not able to defend my position. And I'm a single person against 30 heads who all want to disqualify my arguments.
* I'm not sure if they understand and respect argument theory, otherwise we'll just spend our time sorting out logical fallecies. Though maybe that's not such a bad thing.
* I'm having a hard time imagining how to reason someone out of a belief they haven't been reasoned into.

But on the other hand. I got a shot at changing some persons life for the better. I got the chance to guide someone onto a path away from gullibility towards critical thinking. What I most of all want to convey isn't that god is false. Rather I want to provide the tools with which one comes to such a conclusion.

A start would be to have them all read the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) article on fallacies. But I think the chances of anyone actually reading it are slim.

I could start with logic and the theory of science. That everything which is stated with no evidence can be dismissed with the exact same amount of evidence. That in order to explain something with god you must first explain god. That ...

So when I asked them how they knew god existed, they said they could feel his presence when they pray.  This feeling is purely brain based so I pressed further and asked how experiencing a particular brain state means there is a god.  This is when they started saying science can explain some things but it can't explain love, feelings etc.  I told them that within 20 years neuroscience probably will be able to, so how does a feeling inside mean that god exists.

They couldn't give me an answer I was satisfied with, and every time I pressed them further about the existence of a god it always came to the leap from some badly defined feeling meaning there is a god.

Or I suppose, what is the backing behind this statement?  

I had a garage sale two weekends ago at a friend's house.  In Tennessee.  This was a totally different experience than having garage sales in Michigan, for a variety of reasons.  What really bothers me though is how people seemed to think that it was appropriate to use my sale as their pulpit.  

We were clearly judged by several people for being open Friday, Saturday and (gasp) Sunday.  An old man went on a spiel to me about how evolution is wrong ""some people tell me I used to be an ape hanging from a tree"" (he clearly did not understand what evolution is).  Someone grabbed a large magazine and threw it on top of a book on Wicca that I had for sale so that it would not be visible.  

What really bothered me though is two teenagers (probably 16) came by clutching their Bibles, pretending to look at our fabulous wares, until they made it up to us.  The boy of the two invited us to their church, holding out a flier.  I said ""thank you, but no thanks"".  He shoved the flier into my hand, would not take it back and tried to tell me about how he is certain where he is going after he dies.  Didn't I want that as well?

I had no interest in debating anyone this weekend.  This kid however (the girl with him was silent the whole time) did not want to leave like the others eventually did.  In order to get the message across that we were not interested (my husband and friend were busy with other customers) I told them very politely but firmly that they may want to save their flier for someone else.  We are all atheists here.  

His response was a smug ""Well you know atheism is a religion too, right?""

This is not the first time that I have heard someone say something like this.  What is the reasoning behind this statement?  He left shortly after that but I did not want to continue the conversation even if he had stayed. This was my weekend in the sun, getting rid of stuff and making money.  I just don't see why people think it is appropriate to preach to complete strangers.

Edit:  I saw a few comments (I've read every single one and upvoted all of you for taking the time to respond, even the jerk jokes, lol) wondering how these people knew I was an atheist.  They didn't. (With the exception of the one who I specifically told to get him to move on).  These interactions were just customers going off on their own tangents.  It seems to be acceptable here.

Maybe you'd like something interesting to quote in context in the future the next time Uncle Bob feels the need to chew you out on Facebook for not going to church.

&gt; In Zoroastrian eschatology, a 3,000-year struggle between good and evil will be fought, punctuated by evil's final assault. During the final assault, the sun and moon will darken and mankind will lose its reverence for religion, family, and elders. The world will fall into winter, and Angra Mainyu's most fearsome miscreant, Azi Dahaka, will break free and terrorize the world.

&gt;The final savior of the world, Saoshyant, will be born to a virgin impregnated by the seed of Zoroaster while bathing in a lake. Saoshyant will raise the dead – including those in both heaven and hell – for final judgment, returning the wicked to hell to be purged of bodily sin. Next, all will wade through a river of molten metal in which the righteous will not burn. Heavenly forces will ultimately triumph over evil, rendering it forever impotent. Saoshyant and Ahura Mazda will offer a bull as a final sacrifice for all time, and all men will become immortal. Mountains will again flatten and valleys will rise; heaven will descend to the moon, and the earth will rise to meet them both.

It wasn't anything personal that drew me away from religion or Christianity in particular -- no crisis of faith, no mental breakdowns in Sunday school, or any of that stuff -- I simply learned just to what extent Christianity is a piecemeal potluck of other religions and cults, pagan and classic.

*Before my daughter was born, I decided that I wanted to make a children’s book for her – one that encourages excitement about science, a positive outlook towards atheism and encourages comfort with having beliefs (disbeliefs?) that are different from one’s peers. While I am no writer, and most certainly no artist, I am quite happy with how the book turned out. Now that my daughter is two, she is really starting to enjoy reading this book (amongst many others). 

Creating this book was purely something that I wanted to do for my daughter, but I thought that perhaps someone else might appreciate it or want to share it with their child. 

To that end, I’m offering it up as a free eBook in PDF or MOBI format – available here: http://anderstheaardvark.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/free-ebook-download/

If you happen to want a hard copy of the book, they can be purchased through blurb.com in soft or hard cover here: http://www.blurb.com/bookstore/detail/2107765

Image previews are available at the blurb.com link or here: http://anderstheaardvark.wordpress.com/2011/04/02/anders-the-aardvark-loves-science/

Also, as requested, I have added a ""Remix Kit"" download on the wordpress site. This is an archive containing a .doc, .pdf, and all of the images (drawings) used in the book - released with a Creative Commons license. Feel free to download this and make your own modified version of the book.*

Some good comments were posted in the other thread, and I'd be interested in hearing about other parents' experiences with talking about atheism/religion with their children at different ages. I have given a lot of thought to the matter, but I can only speculate on the future conversations I will have with my daughter. It would be fantastic to hear from those with experience on the matter.

It's been a very long time in the making.  There are ""signposts"" on my journey towards atheism I can point out as far back as when I was six or seven years old.

The most recent and final straw was the birth of my son.  He was born with paralyzed vocal chords.  It makes it so that he has to breathe through a tracheostomy and it requires him to have somebody keeping an eye on him at all times, in case his trach plugs and he suffocates.

The good news is that it's a temporary condition that will likely resolve itself in time.  Upon hearing all of this I prayed more fervently, than I ever have before, for my son to be healed.  Not only did I pray but my family, friends etc.. etc...  This little boy has hundreds of people praying for him.

Has the omniscient creator of the universe got off his cloud to heal one sick little boy?  No.  Because he's not real and it took this final incident for me to finally be brave enough to admit it to myself.

Since I've come to this realization I've started making changes in how I live my life.

I told my wife last night that I was losing my faith.  She seems fine with it with one caveat.  She told me last night ""You know I don't want you teaching our children there is no god right?""

I told her ""I want to teach our children to seek their own answers.""  This one exchange scared me.  I'm of the opinion for a marriage to work the people in it must agree on the big issues (money, family and religion.)  It became clear to me that my new world view changed the status quo of our relationship and how I wish to raise my children.

I feel more free now that I know there is no man in the sky watching me and no hell to be afraid of.  What bothers me is that I don't want my son to be taught from a young age all of the ""fear tactics"" that are used to indoctrinate children into belief.  I want him to choose religion when he's mature enough to do so if that what he wants without the guilt and fear that kept me believing for so long.

One topic that seems to pop up when religion is brought is abortion. The general consensus that I've observed is that Christians are ""pro-life"" and Atheists are ""pro-choice"". I can see why Christians feel the way they do, but why do Atheists seem so adamant about being for abortion (again, I'm generalizing here)?  I think that once an egg is fertilized and starts to create other cells that a new life formed. Who's to say it doesn't deserve as much of a chance as we all had? 

All that being said, I also don't want to sound like I never believe abortions should be performed. If it endangers the mother, or the fetus is plagued with severe medical disorders, I agree abortion may be the best choice if the mother wants it.

I really, truly would.  I don't want to be an asshole, but the more thought I put into things, the more unjustifiable religion becomes to me.  Look at it like this:

Let's say I were a new parent.  I have a child, and I raise this child to have absolutely no self-worth whatsoever.  From a young age, I make sure he is aware that as far as I am concerned, he is a horrible awful terrible being, and that really, the *only* redeeming quality he possesses is his relationship to me.  I make sure he knows he is a failure, and that unless he does exactly what I tell him, his life will be an utter disappointment.  In fact, I go so far as to tell him that I should literally control his life.  I make sure he knows that I will just beat him and punish him mercilessly if he ever turns away from me, but that I only demand these things because I love him.  In sum, I make him entirely emotionally dependent on me, and I abuse this relationship.

In society, we have a word for this: it's child abuse.  Everyone reading this is sure to agree, this type of behavior is *not* acceptable.  In fact, so many people agree it's wrong that we have laws forbidding it.  If it happens, social services can take your kid, and you could end up in jail.  It *is not tolerated*, is my point.

So, I'm sure you all see where I'm going with this... why does religion get a pass?  Shouldn't there at least be laws against indoctrinating children at such a young age?  How is it different than emotional child abuse?  I just really can't justify it.

My mother is a Christian, and I love her to death... she is a wonderful lady.  And I'm a nice guy.  But the more and more I think about religion, the more and more bitter about it I get.  And the approach ""well, live and let live"" doesn't work for me... I wouldn't stand by and watch a child be abused, so why is this different?  Why should we be ""tolerant"" atheists?

I'm not necessarily looking to argue, I'd just like to hear some opinions and reasoning.  I appreciate any thoughts or input you guys have!

**EDIT: A few people are misunderstanding my analogy of child abuse.  I'm not referring to parents that use abuse to force their children into belief... I'm referring to the (predominantly Christian, as far as I'm aware) idea that God is our ""father"" and that without him we are worthless and lost.

Have any of you experienced a similar loss of zeal, or just deterioration to the total apathy I am experiencing? I'm in a Catholic High School now. A senior. I feel as if I am developing a god-complex. I feel as if I am on a different rational level as those around me, and that worries me. I fear I am becoming condescending, and my thirst for knowledge is leading me down a path to total unhappiness.While I try to avoid 'charging into battle for atheism' so to speak, I will not turn down a discussion of philosophy to anyone who asks for it, and I will share my opinion. I do try to engage those who I feel are scholarly and logical enough to a debate, but even then, I feel that they are not on the same level of logical thinking that I am. I feel extremely arrogant, which I am of course ashamed of.  
Do any of you have similar feelings, or have you experienced these feelings at any time of your life? Do they go away? I just want to talk about life as an atheist, and what path I, as a person, am going down with my choices. I can provide more information about my current situation if need be.

1366038236.0,176,self.TrueAtheism,1ce4im,Psychoanalysis and the denial of death as a way of looking at religion and its root causes,JohnBloggs,210,34,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1ce4im/psychoanalysis_and_the_denial_of_death_as_a_way/,"Ernest Becker is the author of The Denial of Death, a great piece of psychoanalytical and philosophical work which draws largely on the writings of Otto Rank. I finished reading this book along with The Trauma of Birth by Otto Rank a couple of weeks back and I figured I'd post some thoughts over here to maybe spark a conversation or at least point some fellow redditors to what I believe to be some great pieces of philosophical work.

I will go on to summarize some of the concepts behind The Denial of Death but I highly recommend you go on and read the aforementioned books. This sort of argument is something which I have yet to see thoroughly discussed on any of the atheists boards I have ever went through. If there have been similar conversations here on reddit I'd highly appreciate it if you could point them out to me.

The idea put forward is that people are terrified of death and that if we were to be consciously aware of our inevitable demise during every second of our lives we wouldn't be able to function. To make sure that our inevitable ending does not creep up into our day to day consciousness we develop repression mechanisms.

The main repression mechanism is what could be called a ""hero complex"". We develop the idea that we don't actually die but continue to live through our work, through our children, in people's memories and so on. On a subconscious level we see ourselves as immortal heroes which will never be forgotten. The work we do and the activities in which we engage every day fit into this pattern and allow us to be oblivious to our own demise. We deny death.

This helps to explain for example why people are willing to engage in the most horrible of jobs or in any other kind of situation which when looked at from outside seems outrageous, or rather dangerous. It might help to explain why people seem to experience similar levels of happiness despite their physical health or material situation. As long as death is denied the rich, the poor, the healthy, and the paraplegic can be happy.  It is when the repression mechanisms fail that both the rich and poor either go insane or fall into depression.

What this sort of death denial also helps to explain, and this is where religion comes in, why people pray, submit themselves to a fatherly god, and fantasize about heaven and hell. The idea of being part of a greater plan, of having an intelligent creator, of having an eternal life beyond the physical one is absolutely perfect in repressing the thought that we are mere physical creatures who ultimately have to die. It's the ultimate hero complex. I think that if we look at religion from this perspective it becomes a bit more digestible or easy to understand. It offers a view which I believe expands beyond the old intelligent design vs science or creationism vs evolution arguments.

Although it may seem to be a weak argument in that the creationist may turn it around and say, ""oh, well, if it works so well in repressing those thoughts and making me happy, then why should I ever give it up?"", I believe that it actually is a stronger argument for the irrationality of religion than even that put forward by the scientific method in that it clearly describes the core of any religion as being nothing more than an archaic reptilian repression mechanism. As modern people we don't have to rely on it to find meaning in our lives or to not be terrified at the idea of death. As modern people we can free ourselves from this reptilian thinking and embrace life, appreciate its limited quantity, find much more meaning in those around us, in our actions, and in our experiences. If these repressive shackles are broken and this dogmatic imprisonment replaced with freedom of thought and experience much more of the world becomes open and available to us in ways which would not have otherwise been possible.

I remember a presentation by Neil deGrasse Tyson in which he was presenting a chart showing how even among the top scientists there is still a small percentage of people who believe in some kind of personal god. He was then wondering whether scientific literacy and reason can simply do no more than that and whether the religious statistics are bound to always asymptotically approach a number which is still higher than zero. My view is that scientific literacy and reasonable thought can indeed only take us so far. It's necessary to understand the deeper psychological issues which lay at the base of religion if we are to ever move beyond that asymptotic limit and reach the zero level on the religiousness chart. It's not the scientific method which religious people have a hard time accepting. It's the psychological constrains which they have hard time giving up.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1ce4im,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1ce4im/psychoanalysis_and_the_denial_of_death_as_a_way/,
1367854037.0,177,self.TrueAtheism,1dsofi,How do theists get from the cosmological arguments to arguments for their specific theism?,omen2k,219,42,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1dsofi/how_do_theists_get_from_the_cosmological/,"After listening to a few debates, I'm noticing a gigantic gap in many theist arguments that's driving me a little nuts.

In many debates I listen to, the theist generally starts with a cosmological argument (i.e. a painting needs a painter, watchmaker, etc) and then debates for a long time that god must be necessary for the universe to exist. 

But even if they then beat the atheist down with that logic and reason, (i.e. forcing them to admit they don't know for sure god didn't create the universe) they still only have an argument for the deist god.  I have pretty much never heard the part where they then go on to argue that their specific god or religion is the correct one. This would seem to me to be a pretty damned important part and it almost always seems to be dismissed.

Or, on the rare occasion it's been brought up, it's almost always down to blind faith and appeals to emotion (i.e. if god doesn't exist how can we have justice and morality?). This is a gigantic change in reasoning and logic and I'm suprised theists don't get called out on it more often in debates. 

Some examples:

[Dawkins vs Lennox](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1dj0li/has_science_buried_god_an_interesting_and/) This debate is probably what made me think of this; although frankly very poor debating on both sides. Lennox makes several ridiculous assertions and rehashes a tired version of the cosmological debate and then makes unbelievably tenuous links to assert christianity is correct (historical accounts are more accurate than modern science for a model of Reality apparently, and plus without the christian god how could we have morals and ultimate justice? Obviously christianity is true!). To my utter disappointment dawkins doesn't call him out on any of it. 

[Laurence Krauss vs. Islam](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheistvids/comments/1dkvjv/the_big_debates_islamoratheism_which_makes_more/) this is a really good example and (although I'm only 20mins into it) exactly what I'm complaining about happens: the Islamic speaker starts with a cosmological argument (despite the topic actually SPECIFICALLY being ""atheism or islam, which makes more sense?"") and then makes a very tenous link trying to make islam look special (Qu'ran is written in super-poetry beyond human capability or something). However in this debate (and I'm only just starting Krauss' first retort) Krauss actually calls him out on it and is going straight onto an offensive... I'm really intrigued to how this will end up.

EDIT: Do not watch, Krauss is absolutely dreadful in this debate. Just... wow. I am actually really shocked at how terrible he is. I actually felt bad for the muslim debator for most of the debate and Krauss sets a terrible example for atheists.

What is a tulpa? [There's a decent wikipedia article about them.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa) However, the tulpa described in that article is a tibetan buddhist concept, and it isn't exactly what I'm thinking of. The kind of tulpa I'm talking about is essentially a sentient imaginary friend. You can visit /r/tulpas or www.tulpa.info for more information.

Why do I think this? Well, let me very briefly outline the basics of what you need to do to create a tulpa.

4. Actually believe that they're there.
1. Have some sort of personality in mind for them. 
2. Force (work on the tulpa) for some amount of time every day.

Compare this to the thoughts of a very religious person

1. They believe that god is there.
2. They have some sort of personality that they believe god has.
3. They pray every day, sometimes for long periods of time.

Next, there's some of the ways that a tulpa can communicate with their host.

2. They can make you feel strong, seemingly alien emotions.
3. They can use ""mindvoice,"" which is similar to holding an imaginary conversation in your head with someone, except the other person's responses aren't made up by you. 

Compare this to what very religious people claim to have experienced.

1. They ""experience god"" in the form of powerful surges of emotion.
2. They claim to hear the voice of god. 

---

I think that god being a tulpa is the most reasonable explanation for these people. They just create one who thinks that they're god. As for people who claim to have heard god and later become an atheist, ignoring a tulpa can essentially kill them. This would also apply to the god tulpa. 

Comments/criticism are appreciated.

Chapter eleven is particularly worth reading, as it concerns Saul and his installation of his family deity Yahweh, previously one of a pantheon of several Canaanite deities, as the national deity of Israel by the 9th century BCE.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah#Iron_Age_Yahwism - Yahweh was originally the war deity of the four major Canaanite deities, the others being El and Asherah, the father and mother figures of the Canaanite pantheon, and Ba'al (in this case most likely the deity named Hadad), who was a sky deity and who was considered Yahweh's rival, hence the Jewish conversion of the name 'ba'al', which literally meant 'lord' or 'ruler', into a sort of curse-name and the evolution of 'Beelzebub' from 'Ba'al Zvuv' ('Lord of the Flies').  Lots of interesting facts about the evolution of the Abrahamic religions out of the region.

My question is shaped by my beliefs on my own motives.  I try, as often as I'm able, to make decisions based on what I believe to be true.  This puts me often at odds with many types of people.  In the Christian circles I'm valued by some, but hated by others.  I'm theologically conservative, but things that aren't important I really do not care about.  I'm likely to call bullshit on one of my brothers in one moment, and applaud them on the other half of whatever their point may be, if it is truth.

What I do need help with; need someone to reach across the table and help me understand: (I apologize if it's been asked before, but this is the first time I've asked) How does one make, abide by, or otherwise have a moral hierarchy if one does not believe in God or gods? 

There is a song, ""Anything goes"", by a band called Impending Doom (death metal for those of you into that sort of thing).  This song has a refrain, ""When everything's gone, anything goes.""  This song is more a criticism of the American Christian culture/political agenda, but I think that line has merit and I venture, as humbly and genuinely as possible, to understand Atheisms side to this.  I could very easily see, where if I were an Atheist, that I would believe that I had license to do whatever I really wished.

Anyway, I hope I haven't made an ass of myself.  Please try to understand where I'm coming from.  

I have family coming in from out of town so I'll be disposed for quite a few hours, but back to check responses to this post later.

The texts were written in a time when literacy was not common with the intention that they would be read by a priest who studied the area for their entire life and then passed on as necessary down to the common man via sermon or whatnot.

On one hand this sounds like an apologist cop-out, on the other hand it may be a legitimate excuse since the bible was probably never intended to be picked up and read like a regular book and is therefore rife for misinterpretation when approached as a comprehensive manifesto of Christianity. If millions of people throughout the ages were able to make a career out of reading the texts, interpreting them with regards to supplementary materials and historical notes and then write their own publications on the matter then maybe there's a lot more information that is lost when you simply pick up the book, read it from cover to cover and consider yourself knowledgeable in the area.

It seems like the more I am exposed to religion, the more confident I become in my Atheism and the less enchanted I become with the whole institution of Christianity. Being an English major involves knowing how heavily Christianity in particular influenced the language and the philosophy of the western world in contrast to other literature written in other languages. I love this part of the major because the evolution of language is very interesting to me.

For this reason, I enrolled in a ""Christian and Post-Secular Literature"" ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postsecularism ) class, hoping to gain some insight, and instead found a severely militant reading list about the damages science has had on society and humanity. 

The most recent comment I've heard form my instructor really got to me: ""My atheist friends quote Richard Dawkins a lot, but his arguments have no evidence and they're just ridiculous to me"". 

I've had this idea for a while, but now I've decided to explore this a little further. I've been seeing it a lot and I don't feel it's exclusive to either side of the religion debate. Here is my question:

While discussing the divorce, I mentioned that I tried very hard to make the marriage work. That's what I believe you should do in a marriage. You have made a commitment, and you now need to stick to that commitment. Life is about making choices and dealing with the consequences. Just because it gets hard does not mean you give up. Unfortunately marriage being a two way street, my wife, was the one who left. After telling him this he asked ""What is your religion.""

I told him that I do not have one. I am an Atheist. 

He then went on to say that I have many Christian values. 

Here's where I disagree. While many of my values and morals may agree with Christian values, or even come from Christianity, I consider them human values. Working through issues with someone whom you love is about commitment. About being a man, and about working through the shit. If you just give up then nothing has meaning. Is that really a Christian value?

While this discussion did not particularly bother me, as it was a tame debate, the next part did.

I feel he overstepped his boundaries in telling me that I should go to church. Not necessarily belong to the institution, but he suggested a Catholic church. 

I went on the say that that would not happen. I do not believe in a god, or an afterlife. I did however say that I believe the afterlife or the soul is a metaphor for their continuing effect on a person or many people even after their death. 

He was not having that. 

To sum up the experience these are the questions that I have, and would like to discuss. 

* Is my therapist overstepping his boundaries in continuing to push this issue?

* Am I kidding myself in saying that my values and morals are not necessarily christian, or am I right to say that while christians may share similar values, my values simply human morality and commitment?]

 I just wrote this long comment that pretty accurately describes my views on what I believe marriage is. For those of you who say it's just another institution, I think it may help clear up what I really mean, for those of you who still care.

As for what I need to do.

I have decided after reading all of the comments and attempted to find the time to respond when I can, that I will see this therapist once more, and bring this issue up, mostly to see what he says. If he accepts my view, I will continue to see him. As I have said, he is pretty intelligent, and has helped me work through some of my troubles. This is really the first time religion has come up. If he does not accept and/or continues to push the issue, I will be finding a new therapist, or possibly, move away from the therapy sessions all together. I might be getting close to that point as it is.

So I've seen a few posts on people sharing their experiences being Atheists in non-Western countries so I thought you might be interested in mine. I'll start my personal (hopefully not too long) story and then move on to the state of the country. Please don't hesitate to ask any question you want.

I was raised Catholic like a lot of middle class people around here. Went to Catholic school, baptized, the whole deal. I was never *devoutly* religious but I did really believe in a God. I remember praying a lot from time to time. 


I became an Atheist when I was 16. Weirdly enough, I didn't turn Atheist immediately. I passed through Buddhism for a few months (seriously). I think I wanted a compromise between religion and rationality and Buddhism seemed to be it.

When I ""came out"" to my mom, she was shocked at first and then started treating it as though it was just a phase. A few months later, when I stopped going to church, she realized I was serious. It didn't make much difference to my dad who's an atheist too. For most of my family, it didn't make much difference, some were shocked.

My school took it badly. *really badly*. I was basically shunned from Catholic classes (like Sunday school but during the week), mocked etc. - the usual ""you're an outsider"" crap. Teachers were comparing me to Satanists and I, the rebellious 16-year old, kind of enjoyed it.

My grandparents still have no idea. They think I'm simply a non-practicing believer. I'm 22 now. I hesitated for a long time but it'd seriously do more harm than good.

At my university (American University of Beirut), Atheists were much more common than at school. I met for the first time Atheists from a Muslim and Druze background. It was really interesting because you kind of have all types of people than you can find in Lebanon at AUB. (You have Druze Sheikhs wearing their traditional clothes walking with veiled women walking with women in tight shorts etc. it's really mixed.) 
Most people around me were religious (all moderates, I'm not friends with any fundamentalist) but it never really bothered anyone that I was an Atheist. People would sometimes try and convince me when we had discussions but nothing too serious.

On a national level, it gets complicated. Atheists are either persecuted or ignored depending on the context. Religion here plays a **massive** role in politics. We have clerics who issue Fatwas against those who are in favor of civil marriage (imagine those who support of Gay marriage) and so on. With most people, it doesn't make much of a difference what you are as long as you're not political about it.

I even talked with 3 Hezbollah members a few weeks ago about this very subject. 2 of them were really understanding and even interested but the 3rd one kept on staring at me suspiciously. But my worst experience was by far with the Phalange (far-right wing Christians) who treated me like a traitor (because I'm still *supposed* to be a Christian).
So I'd say our problem here is mostly political instead of just religious. Unfortunately, they kind of go together.

This places the atheist in the position of acting as astrophysics instructor to a combative theistic pupil, with the implication that any gap in the scientific explanation affirms the existence of a god.

Here's the thing: the question is absolutely irrelevant.

Suppose you discover a box that turns lead into gold. ""Wow!"" you say, ""How does it do that?""

Self-assuredly, your compatriot answers, ""Todd built it.""

That doesn't answer a thing, does it? If anything, all you have are more questions: ""Who's Todd?"" ""Why was he able to build the box?"" ""What makes you think Todd built it?"" and so on. Meanwhile, there has been absolutely zero progress answering your original question, ""How does it do that?"" Even if there is a Todd, and he built the box, that doesn't tell you anything about how it works.

You see where this is going, I presume. Perhaps the theist claims that ""God did it"" is a meaningful bit of physics because, for instance, this god possesses some super-physical property, like ""existing outside of the Universe."" Well, then, you might as well speculate that property belonged to some non-god entity. Perhaps indeed something ""existed outside the Universe,"" but that thing lacked consciousness, or some other essential property of god-hood.

In effect, the theistic claim can be wholly interchanged with a non-theistic physical conjecture. ""God creates matter from nothing"" vs. ""Some entity creates matter from nothing."" And so, the theistic component *adds absolutely nothing* to this particular topic.

The question (""What caused the Big Bang?"") is physics. The response ""God did it"" is not physics. It's not even an answer to the question. So quit playing along as if it were.

1364062164.0,161,self.TrueAtheism,1avb26,Clarification of important definitions - a PSA.,woodD,208,47,114,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1avb26/clarification_of_important_definitions_a_psa/,"I quite often see confusion and misuse of common definitions of words  such as atheist/atheism, agnostic/agnosticism, anti-theist/anti-theism, et cetera (not just in this subreddit, in fact it's probably better here than elsewhere) so I decided to write this post as a PSA. In this post I'll elucidate important definitions and distinctions to be made in regards to specific labels, as well as briefly cover the correct usage of these definitions.

**theism v. *a*-theism:** 

* theism - the belief in the existence of a god or gods; specifically: belief in the existence of one God viewed as the creative source of the human race and the world who transcends yet is immanent in the world.

* atheism - the disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God, a god, or gods. 

* Colloquially, atheism can be used to describe the belief that there is/are no god or gods (an important distinction to make, and this definition falls more neatly under *strong* or *gnostic* atheism, both of which I will discuss later on).

**gnostic v. *a*-gnostic:**

* gnostic - the possession of knowledge, especially esoteric knowledge of spiritual matters; the stance that one can be capable of possessing such knowledge.

* agnostic - the lack of possession of knowledge, especially esoteric knowledge of spiritual matters; the stance that one is fundamentally incapable of possessing such knowledge.

* Colloquially, agnosticism can be used to describe a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God, a god, or gods (I discuss issues with this use later).

**anti-theism:**

* A stance in direct opposition to theism; an active opposition towards organized religion or the belief in any deity; *or* in a more nuanced context it refers to the active opposition of belief in a *specific* deity or deities. [[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antitheism)

* Most often, anti-theism can align closely with gnostic atheism, however, it does not have the same meaning and makes several important distinctions, namely the active opposition of theism.

**miscellaneous:**

* strong v. weak atheism - strong and weak atheism are the more nuanced positions one can hold on the existence God, a god, or gods. A strong atheist makes a positive claim that no gods exist, whereas a weak atheist simply lacks belief. This is different from gnostic/agnostic as both of these claims can be made with or without claims about the possession or potential of knowledge.

* implicit v. explicit atheism - implicit atheism is the absence of theistic belief without the conscious rejection of it, while explicit atheism is therefore the conscious rejection of theistic belief. These two terms at first glance appear to mirror agnostic and gnostic atheism, however, they do have important distinctions. Implicit atheism is applied to those who ""[are] unacquainted with theism [...] [and therefore] do not believe in a god."" Implicit atheism also extends to young children incapable of grasping the complex notion of God, a god, or gods. It should be clear then that those who have been introduced to theistic claims would be categorized as explicit atheists. [[2]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_and_explicit_atheism)

* ignosticism/igtheism/theological noncognitivism - the stance that all other theistic stances (theism, atheism, agnosticism, et cetera) make too many assumptions about definitions and concepts of God, a god, or gods. Generally, ignosticism takes the approach that a coherent definition of God must be presented before the question of the existence of God can be meaningfully discussed. Furthermore, if that definition is unfalsifiable, the ignostic takes the theological noncognitivist position that the question of the existence of God (per that definition) is meaningless. In this case, the concept of God is not considered meaningless; the term ""God"" is considered meaningless. [[3]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignosticism)

* apatheism - the stance of acting with apathy or a lack of interest regarding the concept or existence of God, a god, or gods; i.e. that the question of the existence of God, a god, or gods is neither meaningful nor relevant. [[4]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheism)

* post-theism - the stance that proposes to have not so much rejected theism as rendered it obsolete, that God belongs to a stage of human development now past. [[5]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-theism)

* pantheism - the belief that everything composes an all-encompassing, immanent God, or that the universe (or nature) is identical with divinity. Pantheists thus do not believe in a personal or anthropomorphic god. [[6]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism)

* deism - the belief in the existence of God, a god, or gods; specifically: the belief in the existence of a god or gods that has/have not nor ever will interfere or actively manipulate the Universe or lives of human beings.  This position may commonly be referred to as the belief in the existence of a ""prime mover""; that is, a god or gods that created the Universe and then ceased to interfere with it.

**Correct Uses:**

* gnostic v. agnostic atheism - *gnostic* atheism is the stance that God, a god, or gods *do(es) not* exist, and that this is, for all intents and purposes, determinable.  *agnostic* atheism is the disbelief in the existence of God, a god, or gods, and that this is one of two options: either fundamentally indeterminable (i.e. that one cannot *ever* come to a confident conclusion), or that the specific individual in question does not claim to have knowledge with regard to the existence of God, a god, or gods. Again, it is important to note the differences between gnostic/strong and agnostic/weak atheism, even though a single individual may associate with both.  Gnosticism and agnosticism are claims made about the possibilities and possession of knowledge, while strong/weak denotes a belief in the nonexistence v. a disbelief in the existence of God, a god, or gods, respectively. (this use applies similarly for theism, and thus the labels gnostic and agnostic can be correctly applied in the same way)

* [This](http://i.imgur.com/WMV2Dib.jpg) image is useful for visualizing the spectrum of theism/atheism and gnosticism/agnosticism.

* Independent usage of the term agnostic - while colloquially the term agnostic can be used to describe, as stated above, the stance of neither faith nor disbelief in the existence of God, a god, or gods, this usage is fundamentally flawed.  Either a person has a belief or lack of belief in the existence of God, a god, or gods; i.e. a person lives their life one of three ways: one, said person believes in God, a god, or gods, and thus lives their day to day life with said theistic belief impinging on their thoughts and actions; two, said person lacks belief in (or actively believes in the non-existence of) God, a god, or gods, and thus lives their day to day life *without* any theistic belief impinging on their thoughts and actions; or three, said person lives, for all intents and purposes, as an apatheist, that is they do not commonly consider the question of existence of God, a god, or gods and, again, they live *without* any theistic belief impinging on their thoughts and actions. Thus, at the most fundamental level, a person *cannot* claim to, or be said to, solely be an agnostic; they either live their life believing or not believing in God, a god, or gods. Moreover, the words gnostic and agnostic are meant to describe stances on knowledge, ***not*** belief.

* Mix and match! - many of these terms can be applied simultaneously to a single individual while remaining logically consistent.  Really, the only extent to what you can create with these is just how precise you wish your terminology to be.

I was very curious of the story where there was a starving group of people led by Jesus, and he decideds to share 5 loaves and 2 fish between all his followers. Miraculously, there's enough to feed everyone!
Because I couldn't think of a logical solution, I asked my dad how this was possible. At first, he said ""Maybe he caused a miracle"". But not believing in magic, I pondered a bit more before asking again, ""...But how?""

A theist in this situation would probably explain along the lines of ""a saviour who caused a miracle to save people"", where as non-believer may say that is just bollox. I was the latter, because it was theoretically impossible to use magic. But the answer my dad came up after a minute gave me a whole new view.

""Maybe all the followers had food with them, but were hiding it away. When the single boy's share of food was broken and passed around the group, people became guilty and started adding there share in.""

The whole point of this bread and fish story wasn't about magic or not anymore, but about having faith in humanity. From this point on, whenever I hear about religious stories of any faith, I think of the intent behind it as a way of showing faith in humanity, forgiveness, and protection. There is no wrong answer to the story, one side thinks it's a savior's miracle, the other thinks it's a moral about faith in humanity. But I love the latter.

But really, I was blown away by how, in order to continue dehumanising gay people, he's willing to reduce the institution of marriage into some ugly social obligation. The only way you can rationalise why same-sex couples shouldn't be allowed to marry is to make it somehow about children, but it still doesn't work because then you're denigrating single parents and barren couples. I think if he really believed what he was saying, he'd argue also that single people can't adopt and barren couples can't marry. I can't conceive of a religious person posing arguments like this if they don't have a pre-existing private prejudice. 

Certainly there are religious figures these days who feel that whether they believe homosexuality is a sin or not, their beliefs don't give them the grounds to try and deny people outside of the church the right to the pursuit of happiness. Rob Bell for example.

I think that it's in society's best interest to continue this evolution away from religion, but I'm concerned that it isn't in its death throes quite yet.

Religion's angle back into the mind of society will be compassion.  Unfortunately, one of the major principles of atheism is accepting the concept of darwinistic evolution - survival of the fittest. Compassion, looking out for the poor and sick, these are not concepts that initially align themselves very well with this premise. 

Most of us have grown up with this paradigm of bleeding-heart, liberal atheists and conservative, cash-hungry christian. Unfortunately, I've seen a lot of folks who are now free from the burden of religion taking up the flag of isolationism. Liberalism versus Conservatism was the battle of our parents' generation. It's a war that has stagnated and lost relavence. What is our fight? Libertarianism versus Socialism? I think that could be quite likely.  

Compassion and charity are not things that make logical sense on the surface. It's hard to see or acknowledge the long-term benefit. Yet somehow, we value it. As long as someone else is doing it..? As long as the responsibility isn't on each of us..? 

I don't think that it's extremely clear that we've evolved enough for charity to be an intrinsic trait. And, until that time comes, the burden of charity is going to fall onto a system. Will it be the churches? Will it be the government? Will it be something else entirely?

The lines are starting to be drawn for the war of our generation. I think that if we don't want the pendulum to swing back into the hands of the religious, we need to come up with a better solution than ""live and let live.""

Let me tell something about myself first. (this is a throwaway account and I will try to leave about real details since my girlfriend and friends reddit)

I am a twenty-something year old who was born and raised as a Christian (Reformed).
Although I have been attending church every Sundays of my life, I am not a hardcore religious man. This is Europe. My friends are all atheists and often ridicule religion at times and attending church every week is something that is out of the ordinary here. This is the main reason that has, in a way, suppressed my beliefs or at least express my beliefs openly. Another reason is that I love science and philosophy. I have debates with my friends about life and reality all the time and this often gets in the way of my belief.
I had my ups and downs with religion. But when I went into university, I had to choose. I chose to continue to be a Christian.

**I am a Christian who WANTS to believe**

I like going to church. I attend an immigrant church so this is the only time that I get to meet people from my country. Also, these people are pretty much family to me.

That was just about me. I have a girlfriend who I have been dating for over two years now. She is an atheist. This is not a problem for me at all since everyone else I know are atheists here. She understands that I have a faith (or that I wish to)

The problem is, when we talk about political problems or when religion comes up in conversations, she (or just about everyone) sees religious views or stances as something along the lines of Mormons or Westboro Baptist Church. 

This is not an isolated incident with my girlfriend. I get this with other people also. As soon as I tell them I am a Christian, the way they view me turn 180 degrees. My arguments no longer have any value. 

When I try to tell them that my religion is not like that and explain, I sound more like a crazy defensive religious person.

Upon reading the r/atheism, I know there are places in the world where being atheist is difficult, but that is basically how I feel being religious in North/Western Europe. My friends and my girlfriend do respect my beliefs and they try to understand and we do talk a lot but their views on religion and religious people are concrete, highly skewed and prejudiced.


It's difficult and uncomfortable at times.
Is there any way for me to change that. Or maybe get them to see religion under a different light.
My current strategy is to be just ""good"". The whole point of being a Christian is to project Jesus's image in us. I feel that if they see Christians negatively, it is because Christians have not been projecting that image or have falsely projected that image.

So if, when I am in a conversation and a false or skewed view of Christians come up, is there a way for me to politely tell them they are wrong without sounding assertive or overzealous?

I have *a lot* to choose from, and I imagine my pitch will vary from time to time. I haven't been able to be by my computer as much as I have liked, but I'm still responding where I see fit. Cheers.

EDIT: Spelling

Ever since my ex-girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me for being an atheist, I've had to explain to everyone (within reason) who asks, why. Usually the conversation goes something along the lines of this...

*""Why did you two break up? You were perfect for each other!""*

*""Religion.""*

*""Really? How so?""*

*""Because I don't have a religion, and she can't accept me in a relationship because she's a Christian.""*

*""Well, do you believe in a higher power?""*

This is where I'm stuck. I'm usually juggling a bunch of different possible responses. I'm getting tired of having to explain from ground-zero what atheism actually is and how it is that I'm also an agnostic. 

Honestly, I'm sick of talking about religion with acquaintances because it never ends up well, despite how concise and respectful I am. But it seems like *everyone* has to put in their two cents about their own religious stance that I don't really care about anymore. I don't mean to be harsh; it just doesn't matter to me what you believe in. I'm going to treat you as a human being with the same respect as anyone else unless you negatively affect someone or something. I also usually don't say anything unless they try to push their beliefs onto me or get my viewpoint wrong. I just hate how it has to be such a huge ordeal when I say I don't believe in gods. 

So here I am continually finding myself in talks about religion when in reality I just want to move on with my life; it's caused me too much hurt, hardship, and exhaustion. I'm tired of being told that I'm not open minded enough or that I'm going through a phase and then having to explain myself. The truth is, I do like talking about it, and I am extremely open. I've changed once, so I could change again. But too many people get offended, especially when they ask, ""why don't you believe?""

***TL:DR*** - How do I explain my position (or lack of) simply and quickly without offending anyone or starting a huge religious discussion? What is your one to three sentence pitch?

Need help.,india_is_hot,179,21,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/upg1r/my_religions_view_towards_periods_need_help/,"**Final Update:** Well, it is all good now. I have moved out into a really good university. 


I am a Jain.

Women during period are viewed as impure and essentially treated as untouchables. For 3 days, you cannot touch any other person at home, cannot enter the kitchen, eat alone, sleep alone, etc.

I have repeatedly questioned my parents to justify this practice. Initially, all I got was this is a Jain thing to do and a part of religion and we should respect it. 

I expected that the reasoning for that might have been something along these lines - The practice was started quite a time back, say during the time of Mahaveera. We could assume that there weren't much of hygiene options during that time and it might seem a sane thing to do then. But, why now? 

On questioning this to many people who follow and expect their children to do so, the answers I have gotten are - 

1) Periods result in impurity flowing about of a women's body and kills lots of micro-organisms in the process. 
2) There is a lot of negativity associated with a women during her period.

Hence, she is impure.

Honestly, I don't care to look for religious reasons to say it's wrong. It seems inhumane to treat someone like an untouchable! But, if I had to explain it to my parent in terms which they would understand, what do i say?



**edit** thank you guys. i have less than 3 months to spend at home now, before i am back to my university again. just plan to stick it out till then.

We have had a decent marriage and I felt comfortable telling her anything. After I had done enough research to obliterate my faith, I told her I didn't believe in god any more. Her reaction at first was surprised but supportive. 

That changed after a few weeks. 

She started to doubt me as a person. ""I don't think I could be married to an atheist. What's to stop you from just leaving?""
She was hurt. She said many things that made no logical sense. I get it, though. I'm the one who changed. So in order to keep the marriage together, I lied. I told her I believed. 

The weird thing is that me having to hide it fueled my appetite to learn more from secular standpoints. I discovered The Thinking Atheist, Dogma Debate, Hitchens, Dawkins, Harris, Dennet, Aron Ra, Evid3nc3 (personal favorite). I'd listen to podcasts while driving to work. I became almost obsessed. I learned more about the bible as a clandestine autodidact in a month than I had in my previous 28 years of life. 

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I told her that I could not continue to lie to her any longer. I told her I feared divorce due to what she had told me before. Initially, she was accepting of my honesty. Then things went sour. She attempted to debunk my thinking with the ""if we evolved from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?"" line... This actually hurt me. The woman I loved turns out to be a creationist... Love is blind. 

Anyway. She is threatening to leave me and to take my kids out of state. On one hand, I could fight it but endure a legal battle I cannot afford (her wealthy parents can, however) and end up working more than my 2 jobs at 60 hours/week night shift or I could allow it and ensure my kids will be comfortable (she'd be moving in with her parents)

&gt;
&gt;It’s been brought to my attention that you, as elders of the church, are considering disfellowshipping from me in light of my absence from services. I’m writing this letter to you now to explain my reasons for not attending. I am an atheist. I don’t believe in a god and, because of this reason, I’ve decided to stop attending church services. I understand that this may come as a shock to you and the congregation as a whole, but this is just what I have come to believe. I harbor no ill-will towards any of the congregation, and wish it to be made clear that no one thing has caused this change in my beliefs. This change has been a slow process and has culminated in me no longer identifying with a theistic religion.
&gt;
&gt;I appreciate all the love and support you have all shown me throughout my years at [Church], and I will never forget it, but while you have all been wonderful to me, I simply no longer identify with the beliefs held in the church.

We say that we know life came from some sort of abiogenesis, and that the diversity of life that we see is due to evolution by natural selection. No one has absolute knowledge, but given the data, we have enough knowledge to be reasonably certain of these things. Does that make us agnostic about any of these things? Maybe some, but surely some of these things are beyond the point of reasonable debate, barring new and extraordinary evidence.

Can we say the same about gods? I don't claim to have absolute knowledge of their non-existence, but I do think that given the overwhelming data, I have enough knowledge to be reasonably certain that gods do not exist. Am I still agnostic? Should I take the Dawkins approach and say I'm a 6.9 out of 7 on the gnosticism scale? Can I take it a step further?

I'm beginning to think, that like evolution, the non-existence of gods is certain beyond reasonable debate, given the data we have (which I would contest is overwhelming). If this is the case, then one could say, like evolution is a fact, the non-existence of gods is a fact. I don't think absolute knowledge is necessary to make that claim.

**EDIT** A lot of you have pointed out that my first sentence is contradictory. Fine, whatever, it's not central to the argument. The argument is that there is a point in which incomplete knowledge has reached a threshold to which it is reasonable to make the final leap and call it fact. I use evolution as an example, which scientists consider ""fact"" all the time. I think you could probably find scores of videos in which Dawkins calls evolution fact.

I'm feeling very confused atm because I don't think I've been considering this from a practical perspective. I am not a militant atheist. I know how religion can be important to people. I've seen it up-close with my parents, who never really imposed their religious beliefs on me. I am, however, considering Dawkins' approach right now. I'm beginning think my unwillingness to disrespect people was extreme and wrong. I'm afraid I didn't really think things through. I am also afraid I might go too far with this. I don't want to be unnecessarily extreme.

Here's what's going on in my country right now (apart from the protests): the ""gay cure"" is one step away from being legalized. Our ""Human Rights Committee"" approved this project. Why? Because there's a majority of people from religious parties in there - including the head of the committee, a pastor himself. 

This is not just about homosexuals being discriminated. This is a precedent. Those religious parties, specially the evangelical ones, are gaining momentum. They are taking over, and right now we are vulnerable because of the protests. Don't get me wrong, I'd be outside protesting right now if I were in a major city – the local protest is in a few days. Still, this makes us vulnerable. It should make us stronger, but the middle class is the one protesting. The ""lower"" classes are easy to scare. They are way too ignorant and willing to trust these religious political parties. In every poor area of every city you won't find anything more varied and numerous than ""temples"" – mostly evangelical. They're basically at home in those places. There is where they seek refuge from their misery and fear. And right now they are afraid – not scared for their lives, but afraid that nothing will change. And they will turn to the religious parties for solace. If our military steps in, there will be new elections. And if that happens, which sort of candidates will get the most votes in these troubled times will be mostly up to our poorest citizens.

There are more reasons for me to be saying that the religious political parties are gaining momentum. We have been struggling with a proposition that will grant the unborn rights regardless of whether they are wanted. It's about abortion, yes. It's also about giving a person who was victim of rape not nearly enough rights as the unborn ball of undeveloped tissues in their womb. Right now, it has been amended so that rape victims can abort, but that change required huge push. Also, this proposition still establishes that the law should give the unborn every right a citizen would get from the moment of conception – which is fine, if abortion were legal and the country weren't full of religious nut-jobs just waiting for a chance to convict someone who had an abortion of qualified murder. 

Here is my dilemma. I don't want to be disrespectful. I know way too many religious people who are not disrespectful of my atheism, many who are indeed very smart. Those people are, however, still prone to support some very questionable propositions because of their religiousness. They still feel like being gay is unnatural, that abortion is hideous, that someday atheists will understand ""the truth"". Here is where Democracy clearly fails reason. And I am one step away from defenestrating every little bit of respect in favour of a reasonable government. That's why I feel like I really need advice right now.

I hope I'm in the right place for this.

**Thesis**: Religion is essentially a disease of the mind, and operates exactly as a disease.


**Contention 1**: Being religious is not a choice. It is usually treated as being a choice, but I think it obviously is not. In order to be truly faithful, and not just claiming to be, your brain must accept that faith-based claims are legitimate. If your brain doesn't work that way, you can't have faith. If it does work that way, you can't understand why not to hold those beliefs and will keep the religion to go to heaven and avoid hell or whatever else the religion promises. 

Thus, religion, or lack thereof, is an involuntary property of the brain. It is psychological, but it is still a material condition. 

**Contention 2**: The condition of religion is not inherent to the mind, it is ""caught"" from others. While a disease is caught from the air or blood, religion is transmitted through language, which can allow the contagion to spread just a quickly. Faith-claims are transmitted to people's brains like an infection to the body. The function to discern logic from illogic filters and attacks them like antibodies attack pathogens. Children, the weak minded, and others with undeveloped or compromised logical faculties, are the most susceptible, just as children and others with weak immune systems are most vulnerable to disease. 

The religion evolves through natural selection just as a disease does. The species with the greatest ability to propagate itself survives and others die. Thus the religion develops many of the same features as diseases, such a reproduction. While viruses naturally evolved to ability to turn cells into copies of the virus, many religions command their hosts to convert others. In this way the religion grows and comes to infect entire populations.

**Contention 3**: A religious brain is not working properly, it is sick. A primary function of the brain is to use logic to interpret the world and derive truth from it. Religion prevents the brain from performing this function, just as a disease might prevent the lungs from respirating or the heart from pumping blood. 

**Conclusion/TL;DR**: Religion is a material property of the brain, which your brain caught from others, that is highly contagious and infectious, and makes you sick. In this way it is identical to biological diseases, and should be treated as such. From this perspective, it is truly the greatest disease ever known, an epidemic on an unprecedented scale. Children should be protected from it just as they would be kept from sick people. Logic-therapy treatment should be employed to cure religious people of their illness. Allowing them to remain ill threatens everyone around them, especially their children. People with contagious diseases are not safe parents.

----------------------------------

I hope that isn't too extreme to be given fair consideration. Please commence criticism.

Edit: Thanks for all the great responses everyone. As people have pointed out most of my argument either fails to differentiate the ""disease of the mind"" from a simple meme or is a subjective opinion. Hypothesis rejected.

I don't mean get drunk or high and black out, I'm talking about overheated and fainted. When that happens, you don't even know you passed out until you wake up. I think that's what death is like. You passed out but you never wake up to even realize you died. At that point, everything you've done in your life immediately becomes irrelevant to you because you can no longer fathom it.

I don't believe in an afterlife or reincarnation (other than your energy transfers into another organic entity... like your nutrients being used to grow a tree). I believe once you die, all consciousness ceases to exist, therefore you feel no pain, there are no repercussions and you have no emotional feelings about it.

I believe religion is the equivalent to comfort food. We make these nice stories and do things to ease our worries. With the mindset I've described above (the pass out but don't wake up mindset), it rids the need for the ""comfort"". It's actually quite liberating. You live your life indulging in carnal desires and free yourself from dogma, shame/guilt, and authority.

Some may argue that living a life indulging in carnal desires is wrong or bad... but why? Because their doctrine tells them it is. The 7 deadly sins (greed, lust, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy and pride) actually make you a better person. But here's the key, each in moderation. Envy and greed motivates you, pride builds confidence, sloth balances your work/home life, etc.

But about 8 months ago, I finally lost my faith.  I got a sponsor in AA when I started and I stayed with him, but now he says he's having problems relating the AA 12 steps to me since it depends on having a belief in God.  I said I could still see the value of the steps and saw that being a part of a group of people helping each other to stay sober was doing me good.

He said it's still problematic.  I pointed out that even in the AA big book, it says you can use the group as a higher power, which I did.  He said the Big Book also says that's just for in the beginning and eventually you should come to God.  I just can't, knowing what I know.

I want to ask your opinion about religious (and non) worldviews.

Do you consider atheism or agnosticism to be more religious?

On the one hand, agnosticism doesn't believe *anything* until there's evidence for or against existence of a higher power. So there's zero faith requirement. Given that neither atheists nor theists can prove the existence or lack thereof of a deity, there's less 'faith' involved in agnosticism. None, really.

On the other hand, agnostics are open to the possibility that there is a god, gods, or some other higher power.

So, which do you think is more religious? I know that answers are going to be different depending on how you interpret 'religious.' Just be clear and explain if/when you answer!

A little background. I play drums freelance around the Bay Area and I have a steady church gig that I've had for about 3-4 years now. I play there pretty much every other Sunday in alternation with another drummer. When I first got the gig, I didn't know it would turn into a steady gig. It pays really well, and I think of it as just another gig and a chance to practice playing pop/rock music. I should point out I am an atheist and am very much against religion(to put it lightly).

Here's the problem. They have never asked me about my beliefs(I assume they assume I am christian), however they have offered me communion, asked me to hang with them between rehearsals and the service, some other things like that but they are few and far between. They pretty much just leave me alone and let me do my thing. However, something happened recently that I'm a little concerned about. 

In our weekly email regarding logistics, this was at the bottom of the email under, ""IMPORTANT NOTES"".

""I keep forgetting to ask you to sign the statement of faith.  Forms are on the table in the choir room.  Every year (Church name) asks each volunteer to sign and turn in the statement of faith…it’s always good to go back to the basics every once in a while.""

It's been about a month since I got this email and nothing has been said to me in person. I don't know what I should do really. Just sign the thing, since I'm playing there anyways? Honestly, playing at the church tugs at my morals often. I feel horrible being a part of the very thing I hate, and I would love to not play at the church ever again, but I really do need the money, and the practice helps. 

Any advice or discussion will be greatly appreciated. If anyone has any more questions that can help clarify the situation for you, just let me know. I left a few things out since I wanted to get to the email. Thank you so much! Peace. 

EDIT:Removed church name. Thanks bud!

EDIT 2:I just noticed this. The email says, ""volunteer"" but I'm getting paid. I don't know if this makes any difference. 

EDIT 3:Wow, thanks so much for all the responses. I really expect this much, I was happy with mulling over the decision with the couple responses I got immediately after posting. I will work on responding to all of you that I can. I just opened up reddit after just getting home, and I'm sure I'll enjoy all the responses. Thanks so much everyone. Much love. 

EDIT 4:If anyone is interested, I can post some of the comments I've gotten in emails from the woman who let's me know about when I'm needed and such(who sent the email regarding the 'statement of faith'). It may help to give you some insight into the kind of person/relationship I'm dealing with. Just post a comment if you're interested at all. I doubt this will cause me any trouble, for obvious reasons. Again, thank you all so much for your time in your responses. 

EDIT 5:I am very sorry for not mentioning this in the initial post, but this is a 'contemporary' Christian church. Not Catholic. But thank you all for the responses. I am so glad to actually receive some feedback and feelings from others involved, and not so involved in the church. This is exactly what I needed, I can't thank you enough. 

EDIT 6:I'd like it if we could keep it more of a discussion on my particular situation. I'm sure we all feel very similarly about religion, so why the need to push the topic to people who already are in the same boat and start a needless fight? Thank you for all the responses, and I really appreciate all of your concerns and highly emotional responses about religion in general, but there is a time and place for those discussions. Thank you for understanding.

""The sky is blue,

and what does it mean?

You've been told.
Since long ago,
that a man in the sky, 
made it so.

What others don't.
What you dare to think,
but others won't.

Is there a why?
under every stone?
I think you'll find
we're on our own
but that's ok, we'll hold our own.

Life gave you no meaning.
But that's not sad, not at all.
Your not a robot.
You can make your own.

No eternal fate,
or destiny.
Your life is yours
You're completely free!""

Being an atheist I have friends from various religious and non-religious backgrounds and some of my closest friends are (were) Christians. Religion has almost never been an issue in those relationships. Maybe except with this one girl with whom we had very strong disagreements about pre-marital sex. Anyway, this is not about her and she has already abandoned her faith.

The problem I have is with my oldest friend. We met in secondary school and have been very close friends for 15 years. She and her whole family became Christian about ten years ago when her father who had problems with drug abuse ""accepted Christ"" and was able to quit the drugs. When we meet we almost never talk about religion, we just have really good time, laugh a lot and talk about stuff.

 We used to spend nights awake watching movies, but about half a year ago she said that god does not want her to do this anymore and it is important for her to follow his will. I found this strange, but accepted as her choice (thought that for some reason she sub-consciously wants to stop those). But now, a couple of days ago she sent me a message saying that she is very sorry but god wants her to stop meeting me altogether. At least for a while - sort of give me up for a lent. 

She actually said that she has met god in person and he wants this for her. The thing is that she believes this with all her heart. What I believe is that she has severe psychological problems. 

Now the problem is - what do I do about this? Do I give her time and space or do I try to talk her out of this? I really, really do not want to give up on her as a friend, because she is a wonderful person and deserves the best. Have any of you been in similar situation? An objective outside opinion would really help me out her.

Also, sorry for any weird sentence structures or word choices. My English teacher always said I ""don't feel the language"".




UPDATE: Thank you all for your opinions. They really helped me to take a step back and look at this situation from a different perspective. Oh, and thank you also for the comments on my English - I really do see your point about paragraphs. 

What I did was write to my friend and try and explain how I feel about her decision. I said that although I don't understand what is making her do this, I will accept it and be there for her if and when she decides to talk. 

She answered my letter and said she is thankful that I at least am trying to understand. In her letter she mentions that she had prayed for a true friend and that god had given her me. I guess, lord gives, lord takes away. And, of course, she ended with ""I will pray that one day you meet god"". This was one thing that I really liked about her - she would never tell people, she was going to pray for them. Also, there was no explanation on how exactly she met god - just said it's not something one can explain.

Additional background that I failed to mention before - her dad died about a year ago from AIDS. As we are both 27, she does not live with her mother, but she owns a flat in the same house, so they are very close. 

So, it seems that we have reached a standstill, but although, I don't believe I deserve to be treated like this, I still hope she comes to her senses.

I am an atheist.

My dad is a broken man. He lost his mother, then a son, then his father. My mother had affairs and ultimately left him for a younger black man (race matters - it's the south).

He remarried into a white trash family that uses him for money and a place to crash when they are broke or drunk. His wife is not kind, loving, or considerate and sides with her kids.

He lost his entire life savings in risky stock market gambling.  Almost a million dollars gone including his 401k and 2 inheritances. He has only social security to survive on and that barely covers the basics. He is 65 and facing golden years that are much more bleak than he had anticipated.

He has said on many occasions that he has considered suicide.

Some of this is his fault, some is not.

He told me he has been going to church lately because of the social aspect. He isn't the type that is ever going to be a holy roller or bash gays or knock on your door. But he says he feels so welcome and loved there.

I can't fault him for it.  The church, with all of its flaws, is the only place a person like him can go and feel loved and welcomed. I am a former Christian so I am aware much of that love and inclusion comes at a price.

However, the same people who laughing at Scientologists say that they have respect for followers of the big religions for having faith and being strong in their convictions.  Maybe this isn't generally the case and the group of people I know don't represent the whole, but I've never understood it.

Why does it seem like Christians or Muslims have more credibility?  What makes their prophets any more credible than Hubbard?  The fact that it's old doesn't add credibility, as we know a lot more about our universe than we did 2000 years ago.  The amount of followers shouldn't matter, for all we know in a hundred years Scientology could be a major world religion.  Would it then be credible just because now there are x times as many people believing their stories?

Do you believe that Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism have more credibility than Scientology or any one of the smaller religions or cults around the world?

The overwhelmingly common experience for Christians that I know, is feeling a short of electric powerful shock running through their body when they are being prayed for.

Another common experience is people ""losing control"" of their body when they are being prayed for and dropping back and falling on the ground. Regardless of whether they fall or not, a lot of people claim to feel a ""great love"" and ""acceptance"" during deep prayer.

This next experience regards the ""darker"" side of religion. I was told by one of my friends that he once witnessed an exorcism on a lady.

I've just recently become an agnostic atheist after being a Christian my whole life, having been brought up in a very religious household. All of my good friends are very religious. They don't know that I'm an atheist yet, but they know that I've been searching for the truth for the last few months and that I've become highly skeptical of church teachings, the Bible, etc.

Now whenever I ask them questions and voice my skeptical opinions, they usually fall back on their experience of miracles as evidence for God existing. I'll describe some of them here.

My best friend had excruciating pain in his back, and was in agony a lot of the time. I can verify this as being true, as I worked with him for a while and he was unable to work sometimes due to the amount of pain he was in. He says he went to a prayer meeting where the group laid hands on him and prayed in the name of Jesus for his pain to go away. He says in that instant, he no longer felt any pain and hasn't had pain in his back ever since.

Years ago, my mom had three small cancerous lumps in her neck (can't remember what variety of cancer it was). During a church service, she started to feel warmth in her neck where the lumps were. It turns out that a bunch of people had been praying for her without her knowing. When the surgeons went to remove the lumps, they only found one and removed it. My parents thought that prayer had miraculously removed the other two. And yes, she went in for radiation treatment but I can't remember if that was before or after the lumps disappeared.

These are the two big ones, and of course there are many more 'miracles' that can easily be written off such as prophetic words and coincidental happenings. 

I guess my question is, how would unbelievers respond to these claims? Keep in mind that these are people that I've known for a very long time, and I am quite sure they are telling the truth to the best of their ability. The removal of pain I quickly attributed to the placebo effect, although that seems insufficient for curing the root of such a chronic problem. The tumour story begs the question, why weren't all of the tumours removed? I don't know enough about the subject of biology to come up with any detailed explanations for these things. When they fall back on miracles and ask for a natural explanation, I can only give the honest answer of 'I don't know.'  

I realize this is really hard to respond to without all of the necessary data to ascertain if they were really miracles or not, but they do give me pause. I just thought some people here with more knowledge may be able to lend some insight.

TLDR; Christian friends and family claim to have experienced some crazy miracles, don't know how to respond to them.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1fqsy9,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1fqsy9/countering_testimony_of_miracles/,

1342986511.0,140,self.TrueAtheism,wz84u,Why I think atheists who like Buddhism are wrong,,222,82,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/wz84u/why_i_think_atheists_who_like_buddhism_are_wrong/,"So it seems like many atheists are into Buddhism.  And I don't get it.  My arguments follows.

1.	Suffering is not inherently bad.  The incorrect assumption on which Buddhism rests is that all suffering is a negative experience.  I do not agree.  Suffering can make us stronger and better people.  I think Frankl comes much closer to the proper mark when he says that a man is defined by his reaction to unavoidable suffering.  It is not necessarily something that should be sought out, but neither should it be strenuously avoided.  As an athlete, there are many days when I train my ass off, and I am suffering in the moment.  I’m in pain, and don’t really like what I’m doing, but I do it, knowing it will make me better, stronger, and faster tomorrow.  I think the same can be said, to an extent, for mental/emotional/psychological suffering.  South Park has a great episode where Butters explains that in a way, sadness is beautiful, because you only experience extreme sadness when it has been preceded by extreme happiness or joy.  That you can experience such high peaks of emotion is amazing, but without context, without being offset by some occasional suffering, that impact would be lessened, and would be, in my opinion, rendered entirely void.  The ability to feel such emotions, both sadness and joy, so keenly is a great part of what makes us human, what makes up the human experience and should not be so easily dismissed.  

2.	Desire is the primary human motivator.  I desire food, water and shelter.  I desire to leave the world a better place than I found it.  I desire a good life for those whom I love.  I desire to help others.  Without desire, the species would go extinct in however long it would take everyone to die from dehydration.  Without desire, I think the world would be in a much poorer state; we never would have got past living in caves, gathering whatever sorry foodstuffs we could find.  As secularists/humanists/whatever-ists, we should have the desire to help our fellow creatures.  I feel that not doing so, simply out of concern for our own suffering, is an actively immoral act.  

There are some tenets with which I agree; namely, the idea of mindfulness.  There are some other points here and there, but I am not going to get into them.  Maybe my understanding of the religion is somewhat limited, but I’ve read a few books on the topic, and done a good deal of internet research.  This is the conclusion that I have reached.  Buddhism is directly contrary to what I think it means to be human, and live a fully developed and experienced life.  

EDIT: I see a lot of comments stating that Buddhists do not view suffering and desire/craving as inherently bad; that it makes no ""value judgements"".  I don't understand the logic used to reach this conclusion.  The rationale behind Buddhism (as I understand it) is to reach nirvana; to be blown out, to no longer suffer because you no longer have any desires.  That being said, it seems to me that the view of suffering and desire must automatically carry with it a negative connotation, because otherwise why would you struggle through multiple lives to reach this desireless state?  How is that not a value judgement?

A few folks also say that I'm misinterpreting desire, and try to separate it out into ""want"" and ""desire/craving.""  I think this is basically semantics.  The word ""want"" is a synonym for desire.  The first two definitions of the word want I found online include the word desire; one includes crave. Included in the first definition of the tenet of [tanha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%E1%B9%87h%C4%81) I could find is the desire to hold onto pleasurable experiences.  Is life not a pleasurable experience?  I desire to eat so I can continue living.  If my end goal is to reach nirvana, how does sustaining my life help me achieve that goal?",,False,,t5_2soy6,1343013441.0,,,True,t3_wz84u,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/wz84u/why_i_think_atheists_who_like_buddhism_are_wrong/,

But I really miss the community. I really miss being able to help people in the capacity that I did as leader as a large group of like minded people.

But eventually it became too much. I realized that I was perpetuating a harmful mythology.

So how long did you stick around and pretend, and why did you do it?

I ended it with ""you won't see any atheists beheading people despite being openly mocked and persecuted all around the world....""

Well, a Christian ""friend"" of mine posted this in response:

""The Atheistic Chinese Communist Party does not tolerate religion. Due to its Marxist sympathies the Party simply eradicates those religious institutions that do not support its Communist agenda. Only those religious groups that support the Chinese Communist Party are allowed to exist. These institutions are made up of “puppet” religious leaders that promote the Communist Party. Religious leaders who do not follow the Chinese Communist Party are imprisoned or sent to labor camps or executed. Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims are all persecuted, or does that not matter? Or what about all the people murdered by the other Atheistic regimes? R.J. Rummel, estimates the total death toll in his book Death By Government:

62.9 million in the Soviet Union

32.9 million in the PRC while in power, plus an additional 3.5 million killed by the communist Chinese before taking control
2 million in Cambodia

1.7 million in Vietnam

1.5 million post-WWII Poland

1 million in Tito’s Yugoslavia

plus a suspected 1.6 million in North Korea

All murdered by Atheists dictators because they disagreed with or mocked the Government.""

What are your thoughts on this?  I feel like I responded appropriately by drawing attention to the fact that it's more about getting rid of opposition to power than truly killing because of faith/religion.  Plus, that Poland argument is bullshit; Hitler and the Nazis were very proud of being Christian.  I just get really irritated with atheism continuing to be associated with horrible things like this and people trying to act like, ""ooo, gotcha"" when they bring this shit up.

EDIT: formatting

EDIT 2:  Thank you all so much for your input! :) 

EDIT 3: My response and his response.  Apologies for the lack of capitalization.  Also, yes, I realize I missed the ""post"" part in ""post-WWII Poland,"" so that part is a little wonky.  My first response was written while waiting on this thread to fill up, and the second was using elements incorporated from the first few comments on here:

**ME:** sigh, atheism in this case was simply a biproduct of communism. communists don't want any churches to interfere with the ""fair"" distribution of wealth. and since, communism doesn't actually work, it is more about getting rid of any possible opposition to the communist leader.

this is a common mistake that people arguing against atheism make: atheism is not an organized religion. it doesn't have specific tenets, it is simply a word to describe the absence of belief in gods. which is silly, because we don't have words to describe the absence of belief in unicorns. but i digress...

these regimes weren't beheading people because they were offended by religion, they were beheading people because they posed a threat to their power.

your death toll example of poland, btw, is completely false. the nazis were hardcore christians, and used the bible to justify their persecutions of various groups. also, north koreans aren't atheists; they worship the ""dear leader"" of the time because he is essentially god to them. again, religion in that case is outlawed because it interferes w/ the dictator's absolute power.""

**HIM:** ""the Nazis were NOT, I repeat, NOT hardcore Christians! Hitler wrote in Mein Kompf that Christianity was an obsolete religion that needed to be allowed to die off. Hitler and the Nazi leadership were instead followers of the ancient occult beliefs of pre-Christian Germany. You have to understand that Hitler only wanted things that were German. In his view, Christianity was nothing more than a spin off of Judaism and needed to be removed. However, Hitler knew he could not remove Christianity over night and so he ordered that the German church be twisted to suit his Aryan agenda. He removed all of the clergy and replaced them with Nazi clergy and even went so far as to rewrite the bible to preach the superiority of the Aryan race. Hitlers eventual goal would have been to merge the church with the ancient pagan Germanic beliefs. And the death toll in Poland is a post war total, in Communist Poland, after the Nazis were defeated.

And speaking of Communist, whether atheism is a by product of communism or communism is a by product of atheism is irrelevant. The experience of the 20th century shows that the two go hand in hand. Karl Marx, who influenced these totalitarian states, was a staunch atheist and his Marxism was heavily influenced by his Atheism. So the two are intertwined. You can not have Communism, marxism, collectivism, etc. without Atheism. I completely agree that these totalitarian states removed ""God"" to protect their power. In a state where ""God"" does not exist, the state then assumes ultimate power. In the old Soviet Union or in modern China when someone is murdered for having religious items, it doesn't matter if it is motivate my Atheism or because of a threat to the state power, because the states power comes from the belief in Atheism.

These statements are no more or less ""hateful"" than saying that religion is responsible for killing more people than than anything else. I admit that many atrocities have been carried out in the name ""God"" regardless of who's god we're talking about. However, I condemn all of these! That being said, I find saddening that many staunch Atheist can not except that fact the 20th century was by far the bloodiest century in human history and the vast majority of these atrocities were committed in the name of Atheistic regimes."" *note: my fundie uncle ""liked"" this comment*

**ME:** ""the facts support that religion is often used as a tool to incite violence. mass murders will kill people regardless of their religious leanings.

""In the old Soviet Union or in modern China when someone is murdered for having religious items, it doesn't matter if it is motivate my Atheism or because of a threat to the state power, because the states power comes from the belief in Atheism."" - you don't seem to be understanding that there is no ""belief"" in atheism. this sentence doesn't even make sense. people are killed in crazy dictatorships because the dictators are crazy, not because they lack god in their lives.

i think that this will hopefully get across what i'm trying to say. it seems useless to argue this with you since you insist that ""atheistic regimes"" are a thing the way theistic regimes are a thing. these people are not killing in the name of atheism, they just happen to want their people to worship no god other than themselves: [provided the JT Eberhardt link from spaceghoti].""

I have always had a problem with this claim and I'll try to lay out why.  
  
1. **A real living person called Jesus in the middle East 2000 years ago**.  
This is a likely scenario. Many people in the area was called Yeshua so one should not be surprised if one of them also was an apocalyptic preacher. And yet, even with this claim, the evidence is woefully lacking to non-existent. Besides, the time was time of ignorance and there were many kooks who tried to scam people out of their money by claiming divinity, see [Kooks and Quacks of the Roman Empire: A Look into the World of the Gospels](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/richard_carrier/kooks.html) by Richard Carrier.  
  
2. **Jesus - the Son of God**  
This is the second step that must be supported with evidence and it has not been.  
Jesus was not an ordinary human being, he was conceived when the Holy Ghost impregnated a virgin. Jesus is not human, he is half-human and half-god according to the bible. So, even if you can find evidence for a preacher called Jesus, that in no way, shape or form, validates the claim that he also was the son of god. If you find a historical Jesus, the next momentous task will be to show he was not a human but a half-god. If he was just a human, Christianity is based upon a lie.  
  
The problem with Jesus, is not that there is a complete lack of hard historical evidence for his existence, it is how you get from a human living 2000 years ago to a half-god. That is a step no religious person can supply evidence for and which is the fundamental basis for the whole religion.  
  
Without Jesus being the Son of God - there is no Christianity and if you are a Christian, this should concern you a great deal; and the fact is, there is no evidence for this half-god anywhere.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1k3pwz,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1k3pwz/the_2_steps_to_jesus_the_son_of_god/,

It offers a snapshot of a perfect life, of 'perfect' love; of someone who created for you caring for you endlessly, if at a price. To any Christian, the ideal view of love is and will always be God, and his love for his creation. However, his love is quite obviously not without its flaws, but that's not what I want to talk about. 

For Christian parents, they have this notion that they have never recieved true love from any human being, because no human is capable of the love God gives. So instead of caring for their children, in knowing they will have a short time to express their love in meaningful ways, they take them to church. They have relative strangers indoctrinate them to believe that they are evil, full of sin, and need to seek out this imaginary love that will never touch them, ever. All the while the parents are in another room, searching for that same love which has never come to them, save for in an imaginary, self-induced, euphoric stupor. 

We, as humans, want to be cared for on some level- to know that we are valuable enough for someone to dedicate time to. Christian parents teach their children that the exact opposite is the case- that no human could ever love you the way God loves you, and you have to work for his love. There is no peace for a Christian, no real peace at least. All of the things Christianity is priased for, in my experience, are in reality its short-comings.

If unconditional love is to be exalted, shouldn't we try our best to give that to someone? From this point of view, Christians are kind of like alcoholic parents. To a certain extent, they love and care for their children, but they care less about raising their children than they do about seeking out this love, this happiness, whatever it is they're looking for. This is the reason why so many children raised in Christianity stay in Christianity- they don't know they can find love outside of God because they've never felt it.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_xh2k5,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/xh2k5/why_christianity_demeans_love/,

**Whoever was willing to give them,** meaning he will listen to anybody and believe anything.

This reminds me of my own time at religious school. My parents, neither of whom are believers, sent me to Hebrew school as I was growing up. Years later, they explained their reasoning: They were inoculating me against ""finding"" religion later in life. They figured if I was exposed to religion early, I would question it while growing up, see how irrational it is, dismiss it, and not seek it out as an adult when I'm faced with a crisis or looking for answers the way many born-again adherents do.

And they were right. I stopped believing what my Hebrew school teachers told me even before my bar mitzvah, and ceased attending Hebrew school the week after my bar mitzvah. Seeing /u/darrenmuhammad's comments makes me think my parents had the right idea. It's why I think we should teach comparative religion as part of middle school social studies curricula.

   If you could take an experience, and in some way make it accessible for anyone to have in the exact same way you did then believing in it becomes a little bit easier.

&gt;This is a very common tactic among atheists: claiming that the absence of impossible evidence which can never be produced is some sort of useful argument.

&gt;Of course, we all know that it's impossible to directly share a subjective experience in a way that cannot be dismissed as delusion. &gt;So it makes you feel safe and comfortable to claim that you'll consider the issue if this evidence is presented because you know it &gt;never will.

&gt;What's irrational about this is that we don't get to say what evidence &gt;we'll find acceptable ahead of time; we have to consider we do have.

I grew up Mormon.  I've become less and less observant over the last decade or so (I'm turning 30 this year) and my description of myself has gone from Mormon to Mormonish to agnostic Mormon.  Still, I identified with the religion, my general theology was vaguely mormon-like (with elements of Buddhism mixed liberally throughout.)

Watching my church continue to insist that homosexuality is a sin, and oppose gay marriage not just morally, but politically, was probably the single strongest force pushing me away.  And yet, I still called myself Mormon.  I held that it was possible for the leadership of my church to be wrong, as they were on giving black members the priesthood for so long.  None of that shook me, I thought.

The last couple of months, I've been going through the most severe depression of my life.  A couple of weeks ago, I hit a particularly bad spot, and mentally rehearsed the steps I'd go through to kill myself.  It involved jumping off a building, and going through it in my mind, it felt like a dream.  The sensation of floating, while the ground comes up very fast, and then hitting the ground which is sudden but at the same time painless, and then darkness and then...and I realized I was waiting to wake up, and I didn't think I would.

It's the opposite of ""no atheists in foxholes"" - I was forced to face the fact that when the chips are down, I don't actually believe in any of it.  I don't think there's a heaven, I don't think there's anything else at all.  Just this.

This has not been a comforting thought to me.  I haven't taken strength from realizing my 'true' beliefs.  Instead, it's provoked an existential crisis I'm really not ready or capable of dealing with right now.

I talked to my brother about this the other day.  Earlier this summer, he confronted our parents with his atheism.  This wasn't terribly surprising to me, but my Mom in particular has taken it pretty hard.  Anyway, when talking with him, he brought up a viewpoint I'd never considered.  He said, ""I hope there isn't an afterlife.  Eternity would get boring eventually.  Basic economics - value is determined by scarcity.""

I'd never considered this, and it's an interesting thought.  I still don't feel hopeful, particularly, but I don't feel quite as despairing, either.

If anyone else has similar thoughts that might help me out, or want to share anything you've thought of reading this, please do.  I'm very interested to hear from you.

Edit: I appreciate everyone's concern over my depression.  I'm in counseling, and taking medication, and have an excellent support network of friends.  So, I don't know how it'll end up, but I'm doing everything I can.

I also think it's funny I've been congratulated for my 'rationality.'  I'm exactly as rational now as I was before.  The only belief I had that's changed is a belief (or maybe a hope) in an afterlife, and this didn't change through rational consideration, but a moment of emotional crisis.  Again, I appreciate the thought, but it strikes me as funny.",,False,,t5_2soy6,1346691698.0,,,True,t3_za46w,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/za46w/thoughts_on_discovering_that_im_an_atheist/,

I voted McCain in the '08 election, and it was because I was a pro-life single issue voter. I was of that mindset up until shortly thereafter, when I started actually began reading about the history of my religion and stopped denying all of the corruption and scandal as ""just a few bad eggs.""

Long story short, I took a lot of classes in college which completely turned my world upside down, and I came to the realization that religion was not necessary or important to me anymore, and that I fit the definition of an atheist; a realization that brought me both the highest peaks of catharsis and the lowest depths of existential despair for the better part of two years. 

Today, I voted a straight-ticket DFL ballot, and voted 'no' on both of Minnesota's proposed constitutional amendments (same sex marriage ban and voter ID). While that would have been an absolute impossibility four years ago, only a small handful of my friends actually knew about my massive paradigm shift. However, I posted this on Facebook this afternoon as well as a picture of my I Voted sticker, expecting a bit of friction from some people:

&gt; Obama &amp; Biden and an emphatic ""NO"" on the proposed same sex marriage ban amendment! Now we play the waiting game.

&gt;A hell of a far cry from those bizarre hyper-conservative/Catholic days. I'm glad to be neither of those things anymore.

My palms were sweaty as hell, honestly, as I pressed ""Post."" Much to my surprise, 11 people 'liked' it and two people posted supportive comments. 

I realize it probably doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but it was immensely relieving to finally renounce Catholicism publicly, an institution that had controlled me through fear and threats of eternal damnation for the better part of my life. Ironically, it was my Catholic university that provoked such deep thought and discernment in the first place.

I'll start out by saying I don't go out of my way to ""deconvert"" theists into atheists. It just often happens over time with close friends of mine. The basic idea of this method is to get them to start questioning almost entirely *on their own.* This method should only involve discussions, not arguments or obnoxious statements (eg., ""magical sky fairy,"" ""poofed into existence,"" ""flying spaghetti monster"", etc), and you need to be pretty well read if you want a successful outcome. Most of this method will require that you approach certain topics from a Christian perspective for the sake of reaching a desired goal.

**Ideally, you shouldn't even have to reveal to them that you're an atheist.** 

In the last two years, I've found that I've ""deconverted"" five of some of my closest friends. Admittedly, three of these were on accident, and I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to do this if they require religion for some sort of emotional void. 

All that being said, let's get to the meat of the topic.

------------------

* Assumed Variables

There's a couple of reasonable variables that need to be present in order for this method to work. 

1. They *must* be open-minded. This seems like a no-brainer. If they still have all the same ethics and opinions their parents had, they're probably not the type of person to which this method is applicable.

2. At least a semi-close relationship with the person. You're not going to convince anyone at the bar that their religious beliefs are wrong with this. It requires a series of discussions (not arguments), spread out over time, without hostility. 

----------------------

* Method

This entire process will usually take between 3-8 months from the initial discussion to the time they officially come to the final conclusion. I equate it to making a good stew, with some ingredients going in first, simmering for a time, and then gradually adding in more ingredients at the correct time to get the final product. Adding all of them at once, or at the wrong time, won't lead to the ending that you had in mind. 

----------------------

**STEP ONE: Removing the fear.** Religious people may not realize it, but a *lot* of faith is held up by pure fear. I personally think that the Bible supports annihilation a lot more than eternal torture. Your first step is to [read this](http://www.revelationofjesus.net/important-questions/what-does-revelation-say-about-hell.html) which sums up what I'm saying. Then go through the individual verses in the NT (preferably King James) if you want to read it in that new light. 

Once you've done your homework, look for the appropriate time moment to bring it up. Don't just bring it up on the spot. Wait until it's relevant. For example, I once saw my friend posted something on Facebook about how ""people shouldn't joke about going to hell"" because hell is something to be taken seriously. I took that moment to share my interpretation with him. We had a long conversation through Facebook chat after that, I cited sources and verses and he believed in the end that hell was annihilation.

You're going to have to be able to approach the subject from a Christian perspective, rather than an atheist perspective.

-------------------

**STEP TWO: Remove the source of ultimate truth.** You've already shown them that the Bible can be a drastically mis-interpreted, and even they've mis-interpreted before. They're now more likely to be open to the idea that something (just approach one topic for now) in the Bible is totally, absolutely wrong. You're going to have to know their point of view on a topic or two before you approach this.

Do they not believe in evolution? That's an easy one. Do that one. Do they not know about the slavery and oppression of women in the Bible? Show them those and the pure immorality of what God allowed. No to the Big Bang? It's a bit more complex of a topic, but give it a shot.

There are so many ideas and concepts supported by science that are directly contrary to what the Bible teaches. This conversation might have a bit more of an air of argumentation, but really try and act like you are discussing or teaching rather than debating. Finally, slip something like this line in there, ""Looking at the physical evidence, it really doesn't matter what the Bible has to say about it. It's truth. It's truth I can physically test for. But the important parts of the Bible don't have to deal with how the earth came to be or how man came about. It's about how to live your life.""

Basically, this is getting their feet wet in the pool of independent thought. They can take the morals of the Bible, maybe the afterlife parts too, but think for themselves in the matters of the world. 

-------------

**STEP THREE: Wait.** Yep, you're pretty much done. All you have to do is wait. You've done your job. Over time, they're going to start thinking on their own about it all. At best, they're a theist by the end of step two. But over time, they're going to keep hopping their stepping stones out of Christianity, out of theism, out of deism, and finally into the agnostic realm.

----------------------

I honestly think this method is more interesting in that it really highlights the 'pillars' that keep religion alive. They offer both safety and knowledge. When you take away those things, why need religion?

Will this work every time? Nope. Is it always appropriate? Nope. Should you go out of your way to do it? Probably not. Do you believe all the Biblical interpretations that I've provided? Maybe not, but I've provided all of this simply to highlight what holds up the Christian mindset.

It'd be nice to get some responses from those who were total believers who became atheist maybe earlier on than others as well, more of an extreme than myself at a young age. However I'm not talking about a person who was religious and then was challenged directly by others to rethink their ways or went head first into a ton of research, this is more about those who did it more on their own without perhaps any research about other possibilities, say nearly entirely within their own heads despite everyone around them saying it was the truth or a person who said something you overheard that might have broke you slowly. Why do you think many fall for it/are brainwashed while others are not? It seems likely a person who had something come up that challenged their beliefs would reach the same conclusion to me, and must happen to many others but that does not happen. These days I'd guess self education would be the more likely path to take with the internet being so easy to access but that wasn't the case when I was a kid I didn't have a family computer until much later in the early 2000's and it was pretty bad dial-up that didn't stay connected reliably let alone the library as it was quite small and limited in the tiny town I grew up in. So those younger than I and have these sources now so actually it'd be nice to hear your thoughts as well.

That is a block of garbled text, so I'll try laying out some proper questions.

----------------
**Questions:**

1.) How did you progress towards realizing you were an Atheist, for those who were brought up in a religious family and how has that changed your life for better or worse?

2.) It seems likely younger people would still slam head first into something that would challenge their beliefs no matter what at some point even more so today, why is it that this breaks the irrational mind of some but not others? Is this simply just how embedded the beliefs are when the first challenge appears?

3.) Has the rise of the internet and public schools (not everywhere I know) not subscribing to one faith made this process much easier?

----------------
**My personal experience**

I suppose I should write out my own experience as I've never really wrote it out before and part of this is more to get it off my chest, and help explain why I'm asking these questions. Its going to be long I think so I apologise in advance. I've never said this to anyone before properly beyond a few snippets with close friends.
----------------

As a very young child I did as any other and just tried to please my parents not knowing any better, attending church and bible studies but a memory that stuck with me all of this time despite not remembering much of my elementary school days any more was during school assembly where every day in the gym we did a morning prayer along with the national anthem before moving on. (This is what the public school system was like in the 90's in Alberta, Canada they don't do prayer any more, not sure even about singing the national anthem any more) However one student I happened to be standing beside one day didn't bow their head and pray and it confused me and I asked her why like the bold bastard I was and she replied that she didn't believe in that god. Simple matter of fact statement, blew my 4th grader tiny mind. its my clearest early memory so it really stuck to me. I wonder now if that hadn't of happened to me what my life would be like now continuing on learning false truths being further embedded into my mind through the church and my family, in the end I might have been happier and more successful in a messed up way. It seems I gained critical thought very early on however I continued going to church and listening to what my family had to say for years after but I think that put in place a kind of mental firewall. 

As I continued to grow up into a more adult like mind I reached the point where I was questioning everything told to me constantly but not really consciously, started dreading going to church but not really knowing why, not seriously listening to anything I was told I didn't really fully trust anyone any more. I read the bible in my own time instead of hearing about it through others but I was still young and couldn't really understand some of the language, but I had nobody to talk to about my problems nor did I really think to seek out knowledge, not even my own parents because I feared what they would do and I didn't want to cause any drama or let on that I was having doubts, and I continued going to church for years. One day I reached a point where I was going to try as hard as I could to believe what I was being told every day of my life as hard as I could and I signed up for one of those bible camps at the age of 14 to see if they could help me finally figure it all out. 

It was a 2 week long period of my life I'll never forget. I listened to the teachers, attended the mass where people sang religious songs, put on plays, and had a fair amount of speakers come out to talk to us day after day. I tried to understand their joy, tried to understand their faith, tried to believe what they did one last time. Then came the final day at camp where we were all told to go off on our own and pray, speak to god, have a spiritual experience or for those who were on the fence to decide if they believed. I tried as hard as I could, in the end practically screaming in desperation in my own head for god to tell me he was there in some way, to hear his voice as others had told me they could. Nothing but dead empty silence. I sat there for what seemed like an hour in complete mental silence that finally broke. I don't know how many of you have felt such frustration and devastation, boiling hatred and betrayal of your fellow man as I did that night. I felt emotionally drained and hollow. I had done everything I could to give god and the Christian faith a chance only to realise that everything was wrong. 

After coming home and Sunday morning rolled around I stayed in bed, my mother came in and asked why I wasn't up and I said I was sick. Truthfully I was not physically though, the idea of telling my baptist Christian mother I could not even entertain the idea of setting foot in that fucking church ever again without feeling physically ill was hard to come to terms with, I did though that next Sunday morning. I was nearly disowned after a very emotional fight with her but in the end she allowed me to stay, probably after talking to others at the church I'd imagine and over time came to accept me once again, but there has always been a bit of a distance between me and my family since then, especially my mother. I don't think I would have been able to cope with pretending like is often suggested I agree its a good idea for most who didn't come to be an atheist the way I did and to wait until being independent to say anything. Since then I've done research and still continue to do more to better understand humans, history of religion and its helped me bother living really. There have been some pretty dark periods in my short life so far my grades dropped off sharply during the rest of my school life and I only just barely scraped by and now I do labour jobs which thankfully pay well here, I've never been able to get through a college course. I have no motivation or drive still and suffer from depression, but I'm trying to better myself so one day I might be able to try once again it is slowly getting better. I've had flings in the bars but never let myself have a long term girlfriend because I'm too scared of people getting so close to me. Its hard seeing kids being brought to church because of my experiences, conversation with my family still feels forced to me but I'm working on that to and they still support me. I was a pretty broken person for some time. Since then I've moved to Edmonton, read a ton of books mostly online. The rise of the accessible internet has happened during my life and I get to talk to others with the same ideas now and its great, don't take it for granted for those younger than I, and I'm only 22.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for nearly 2 1/2 years. Her family and herself are very religious (Christian). I'm not sure of the specific denomination while I have been questioning whether or not there is a god, etc.

I've read a few books on the matter, and I am currently an Nuclear Engineering major so I like to think logically and I believe in major accepted theories like evolution and the big bang. I personally find it hard to believe in a god especially when other people like to reference the bible as to why it's true. Anyways, not trying to get off topic, but my girlfriend has known that I'm not religious and we just recently had a talk about the existence of a higher power. She is also a nuclear engineer as well but yet for some reason, she doesn't fully believe in evolution and she still thinks that the world started with Adam &amp; Eve and the rest of Genesis.

After just asking her questions about the logic of believing in a god I then asked her if she could ever truly be happy with me because if she believes that I won't go to heaven with her, then will she be truly happy with me knowing I'm not 'saved' or I've rejected Jesus Christ. She said that she is happy with me but she doesn't know if she could be fully happy knowing that and she also imagines going to church every Sunday with her family. Don't get me wrong, I would go, but it would just to be with her and be around the community. I try to think of myself as being very open minded and I wouldn't disrespect someone else's belief, but I'm at a crossroads because I don't know what to do other than to just love her and make her happy.

I opened the door and greeted them warmly - they asked if I was familiar with their church. It was at this point I admitted I was an Atheist. At this point I could see the fear in their faces (I honestly thought they were about to turn and run) It was then I explained why I was Atheist, and that (being an Agnostic-Atheist) I could see justification in what they believed. We talked for a few more minutes on my values and morals, then switched to a conversation on how their mission-trip was going and what they hoped to accomplish. It was then that our conversation ended, and I thanked them for stopping by. They asked if I wanted their scripture, but I politely declined.

I posted this on /r/Christianity earlier today, and a fellow Redditor there who is also an atheist asked me to cross-post it here. To preface, I'll explicate my position: Jill's approach is much better than Dave's; Dave's hinges on ""secret genuineness"" which can be toxic for communication.

---

""No True Scotsman"" is a rhetorical trick where you modify the definition of something on-the-fly to rebut someone's claim of an exception.

* Let's say I proclaim, ""All Scotsmen love haggis.""

* A person might say, ""I'm a Scotsman, and I hate haggis.""

* I could then claim, ""Well, then you aren't a *true* Scotsman. *True* Scotsmen love haggis.""

In this case, it works a bit like this:

* Dave says, ""Christians do good things.""

* Jill says, ""How can you say that? What about the forced conversions, burning of heretics, and wars of religion we see perpetuated by Christians throughout history?""

* Dave replies, ""The people who did those awful things weren't *true* Christians.""

Sometimes, though, the intent is not to perform a rhetorical evasion, but to clarify that particular *sense* of the word they were originally employing. In the above, it may be that there are two definitions at play:

* Jill's definition of ""Christian"" is probably in the sense of outward and visible declarations of belief and/or allegiance. In this way, many people responsible for unimaginable atrocities have declared belief in Christ and themselves Christians.

* Dave's definition of ""Christian"" is probably in the sense of an inward and relatively invisible state of an individual and her genuine relationship with Christ, which ostensibly prompts her to act charitably as she is being sanctified by his Grace. When a person commits an atrocity, then, it is a spike of evidence that they are *not* a Christian in this sense.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1cotz8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1cotz8/truefalse_scotsmen_and_truefalse_christians/,

I spent the last 27 years of my life as a Catholic. I spent about 23 of those years going to church actively, and believing strongly in Christianity. 

When I was dating my now-husband, who was Protestant and is now agnostic-atheist, I began hating much of what Christianity had to offer, but still believed in God. I stopped attending church, and without the indoctrination of mass I am now identifying at an agnostic-atheist as well. Being a biologist and liberal, it's not hard to transition from catholic to not. 

I have a baby daughter. We just had her baptized because in the Catholic church, it is hard to join if you don't have the first two sacraments, and I think she deserves a chance at whatever she chooses to believe. 

I also teach biology at a Catholic school. We teach pure biology, evolution, etc, and are competitive in our science department with public schools, but we have public Mass. 

I have two issues. 1) I was once a Eucharistic minister for the church and as such at group masses at school I am often asked (read: forced) to serve as such. How do I stop doing this with tact? Teachers have been fired for going against the religion (yeah, it's legal in the private sector), and even the few Jewish and Muslim teachers we have participate in Mass, skipping eucharist of course. So, I feel like a fraud. How might you handle this? We give mass with the entire 1500 student body, and every administrator. As a former catholic it really rubs me wrong to receive communion and not believe it's the body of Christ. 

2) My daughter. Tooting my own horn, my husband and I are very intelligent. Barring a learning disability, daughter is likely to also be smart, quiet, and curious, as we both are. My mother is a strict Catholic, and the reason we baptized daughter for the most part. How do you lie to your child's face, going to Easter and Christmas service as a family with grandparents/aunts/ uncles who are all Catholic, and participating in something you don't support? I am helped in that my husband grew up Protestant, so he sits there and doesn't move through much of mass anyway. We love Christmas as a secular holiday, but the Jesus part of it will be hard, especially as my Mom, sensing my lack of interest in religion, is constantly making crosses on daughter's forehead and singing Jesus Loves Me. 

I guess I just would love some words of wisdom. I am not ready to have my work fire me or my mom disown me (she thinks atheists are the devil) and so I can't ""come out"" as a non-Catholic, no less agnostic or atheist. I just am curious about how you make yourself less of a presence in a religion others assume you're a part of, and how you explain as your child ages.

EDIT 2:  I have some followup questions that aren't for the survey, just out of my own curiosity.  I may add more later as I think of them.  

* As a white, straight, Christian, educated, American male living in the South, I know I'm living pretty much at the top of the heap.  I know that majority privilege is a thing, but I don't have many conscious experiences of it myself.  Could you share with me a time where you experienced ""Christian privilege"" or saw it at work?

* My parents got involved in non-profit medical work overseas because of their religious beliefs led them there, and that had a significantly positive impact on my faith growing up.  They also taught me about evolution and gave me a love for science.  Do you think that having a close friend or relative living an authentic life would have had an impact on you growing up, such that you might have pursued faith yourself?

* Emergent church leader Brian McLaren and author of *A New Kind of Christian*  is quoted as saying (from my paraphrase) ""The question of evangelism should no longer be ""Do you want to go to Heaven?""  but ""Who do you want to be in twenty years?""  Do you agree or disagree?  Do you think that Christianity offers a path to being a better person?

* Have you had positive experiences with church?  If not, what would a positive experience look like for you?  What would you like to see in a church?

* Organized religion often gets a bad rap, and often deservedly so.  If you were the leader of a group of people with like-minded beliefs and wanted to have a positive impact on the world around you, what would that look like and how would you do it?  Along similar lines, is there anything that would get you interested in getting involved with a church, whether through non-profit work, volunteering, or anything else where you're spending time with church members?

My biggest irrationality is quite a significant one.  I have a huge fear (I'd nearly consider it a phobia) of ghosts and people breaking into the house at night.  Now, perhaps the latter is at least somewhat feasible, but I live in a very safe suburban community.  The former will probably trouble many of you.

(Cross-posted from /r/atheism.)



**The situation:** So, adding to the long list of discussions that I'm having with people who hold quirky views in my extended family, I'm now trying to summarize some basic biology and cosmology for a younger family member who has had the misfortune of being raised to believe in YEC. 

While I'm reasonably confident in my discussion of evolution, I haven't really followed current thinking in abiogenesis as closely (aside from some brief forays into the journals, Talk Origins and Wikipedia, some of which I've paraphrased in my response). So—knowing that many of you have had to deal with this—before I passed this along, I wanted to run this by you fine folks to see if there is something that I should add or change.  (Suggestions for resources that would be appropriate to share, for explaining either abiogenesis or evolution at the level of a high-school student are also very welcome.)



**The text:** *(Starting at the discussion of abiogenesis.)* 
Also, it’s important to separate evolution (the change in a gene pool of a population over time) from abiogenesis (the origin of first life on Earth). It’s important to note also that even abiogenesis isn’t purely due to chance. The way that atoms and molecules arrange themselves isn’t purely random, but due largely, in many instances, to their chemical properties. Carbon is especially prone to developing complex molecules. Once a molecule forms that is (at least approximately) self-replicating, natural selection will guide the formation of ever more efficient replicators. (There is a variety of options that fall out of organic chemistry’s competing, interconnected reactions—some examples have different molecules replicating each other, so simple, single replicators are only one option, but for simplicity, I’ll just stick with the idea of a single replicator here.) Early self-replicating molecules wouldn’t need to be as complex as a strand of DNA.
Part of the problem with choosing the correct way in which abiogenesis progressed is that there are so many plausible ways in which it could have occurred. For instance, just sticking with single replicators: (1) we know that some RNA can self-replicate, (2) we have observed RNA forming from its component molecules, ribonucleotides, and  (3) it has also been shown that you can take some of the simple molecules that, to the best of our knowledge, were present on the early Earth, things like phosphate and cyanamide, put them in a pool of water, heat it up, let it evaporate, then refill it with water (the sort of cycle that could occur in a shallow pond or tide pool) and you will start to accumulate sugars and ribonucleotides. For instance:
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7244/abs/nature08013.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis 

[...]

I agree that having a whole string of human DNA form purely by chance would be extremely unlikely. Then again, as we have seen above, neither abiogenesis nor evolution function purely by chance. I’ll emphasize again that there are a number of models for abiogenesis, but we’ve seen above that: (1) some RNA molecules can be self-replicating—here I’ve been considering RNA, but as far as I know, this is also true of other molecules, such as some hexanucleotides and certain types of peptides—(2) we know that RNA can form from its component molecules and (3) we have observed these component molecules (ribonucleotides) and simple sugars form in conditions where you take molecules that were probably present on the early Earth, put them in a pool of water, heat it up, let the mixture evaporate, then refill it with water, such as might have occurred in a shallow pond on the early Earth. Add onto this that it appears that if we just gather some (abiotically produced) organic molecules together in a similar environment to the early Earth, they can form protobionts, which are tiny little particles in which organic molecules are surrounded by a membrane (see the research of Sidney Fox and Aleksandr Oparin, for instance http://www.biog1105-1106.org/demos/106/unit04/media/3a.protobionts.pdf). These display some of the features of life: they can self-replicate, they maintain an internal environment that is different from the surrounding environment, they demonstrate a metabolism and it seems that they could be the precursors to bacteria. From there, we have seen individual cells evolve into multicellular life in the lab http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/01/evolution-of-multicellularity/ (regarding potential issues with this example, see here for a response and rebuttal from the researcher: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/01/18/evolving-bodies-a-storify-follow-up/#.UT0Ggda87mc but there are many other suggestive examples to point to, including pseudomonas fluorescens, choanoflagellates, desmidoideae/green algae and neisseria) and so on... So, this doesn’t seem implausible to me at all.

We both came from religious families but I started questioning it in middle school and pretty much stopped believing once I got into high school. My girlfriend started questioning it once she got into college and had a theology course, where she learned more about the religion then what she was exposed to in her rather narrow minded upbringing. She stopped believing in Christianity shortly after that, but always missed a lot of the religion. She still frequently listens to Christian music because she likes the way it makes her feel (I suppose the hopefulness? I also imagine there is some nostalgia to it as well). She just graduated from college, and while she already has a full time job, a job opened up at our old high school for an alumni relations position that she has decided she really, really wants. Since it is a religious school, they want someone religious who goes to a church within their somewhat tiny denomination.


My girlfriend has since decided that she really wants to start going to church on some Sunday mornings - not because she wants to get back into religion - but because she really likes the way they make her feel. On this past Sunday morning, she went to a church near us (not even within the denomination of the private school) for the sermon. She isn't doing this just to get the job, although I think that is fueling it somewhat. I told her I was not going to go with her to sermon, because I don't like church, I don't like supporting a church, and I don't like what they represent. She said that was fine and went by herself.

I don't really know what to do. My girlfriend says she isn't going to become religious again because she doesn't believe in it anymore, but I'm afraid she's going to lie to herself and try to make herself believe. She is going to church on Sundays because she likes the way it makes her feel. She wants to get a job at a religious institution and is willing to lie about her beliefs for it. She's afraid of the unknown and what will happen when she dies. She doesn't really understand why it upsets and frustrates me that she is going to these Christian churches that she consistently insists she doesn't believe in for comfort.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the advice! Looks like the overwhelming opinion is that I'm overreacting :). Maybe I was just somewhat thrown back by the suddenness of it, I thought we were at least similar pages with our beliefs. I also have a little trouble understanding exactly where she's coming from with her desire to go to church, but I think that's my problem. I'll stop talking to her about it and let her do her own thing. If she DOES want to delve deeper into religion rather than just use it for comfort, I suppose that's a conversation for another day and I probably don't have anything to worry about!",,False,,t5_2soy6,1374625967.0,,,True,t3_1iwift,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1iwift/my_nonbeliever_girlfriend_is_going_to_church/,

Long story short, we talked and talked, and we came to a dead end. Every argument I made against religion was countered by their argument that it is **the misuse of religion.**

1355937723.0,117,self.TrueAtheism,1547t0,[Update] Received a lesson on ID from my students,belengthy,143,26,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1547t0/update_received_a_lesson_on_id_from_my_students/,"Background: I am a high school teacher who was invited to hear a lesson, presented by students, on Intelligent Design. It was set up by a colleague who was stunned to find out that many of our brightest students believed in Intelligent Design. I was invited, as I was equally as stunned and was curious to hear their rationale. This was a closed-door lesson, with only the students who were presenting in attendance. I came here to get some background reading beforehand and some people asked for an update, so here it is.

Religiously, the students represented a few different faiths. Evangelical was the most prevalent, though there were some Protestants and a pair of Roman Catholics. I pointed out that the Vatican supported evolution, which surprised them, but they didn’t pay it any mind.

None of what I heard was particularly groundbreaking, especially since I had done my reading ahead of time. To be honest, I was disappointed in the presentation and felt that I could’ve argued their point better. It did eventually come out that they would believe in ID no matter what evidence was presented to them, so their lack of knowledge of ID doesn’t surprise me; they have accepted it blindly and will continue to do so.

Here are just some notes I took, most of it just the various arguments they brought up about why ID is right:

* Christian faith is not required to believe in ID
* They accept adaptation but not species evolving from other species
* Brought up specific complexity (though not by name) and argued that DNA is information and information has to be created
* Mentioned irreducible complexity briefly (again, not by name). Can’t recall the exact example they used, but it was something about the human body and removing organs
* When asked about mutated viruses and micro- vs macro-evolution they had no thoughts
* They questioned how random mutations can create a pair of perfectly compatible male and female organisms
* Cited Book of Job and supposed dinosaur description
* Mentioned carbon dating and how it has a limited life, so how can the Earth be older than that
* Acknowledged that creationism and ID are the same thing
* Pointed out that long-period comets (&lt;100,000 year orbits) conveniently originate somewhere beyond the reach of our telescopes
* Piggybacked off the comet point with the claim that evolutionists just make up stories
* Mentioned that the human body is so complex and that it’s amazing that each cell knows exactly what do, so it must be created (specific complexity again)
* Brought up that every culture has a flood story, so there must have been one major one (trying to validate the Bible I’m guessing)
* Mentioned that science has, and will, continue to change its mind so they think sticking to something concrete (the Bible) is better

That’s about it. We tried to avoid debates as much as possible, so there was little confrontation and we just listened most of the time. I tried to explain the concept of a theory after they brought up science changing its mind, but I didn't get any response back.

What I took away from it was that they had zero concept of just how tiny evolutionary changes can be and how long the process can take. If I was to ever try and de-convert someone, I think I would focus on the age of the Earth more than anything. I feel like if you can wrap your head around how old the planet is, than the concept of evolution becomes easier to grasp.

Oh, and the biology teacher that was brought up in my last post (claimed to not believe in evolution), she turned around the next day and said she kidding. You can take that for what it’s worth, but I do know she purposely puts the evolution unit last in her course so there’s a higher chance that she won’t have to cover it.

My goal was to gently correct some things they said about atheists and help them see that we're all in this together. How did I do?",f22afguy,172,64,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1jvwvh/this_is_my_response_to_a_segment_on_a_radio_talk/,"Rick and Bubba,

I enjoy listening to your show, and your segment on the Cullman County School Superintendent's defense of his prayer caravan was particularly interesting.  I agree with you that Mr. Coleman did the right thing! The Freedom From Religion Foundation was incorrect in saying the caravan was a violation of the Establishment Clause, which says that the government ""shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.""  There were no laws made, and no one's religious freedom is in danger.

I would also like to clear up some common misconceptions about atheists, even though I do not agree with all atheists about everything.  First, you were correct in saying that a ""pure"" atheist has proof that there is no God.  You cannot prove God does not exist, just as you can't prove that there is no teapot orbiting the Sun between the Earth and Mars.  I consider myself to be an ""agnostic atheist,"" which means I believe no one can know for sure whether God exists, but that it's more likely than not that He doesn't.

Second, the lack of religious belief is not a religion in and of itself.  To illustrate, consider a random dude living by himself on an island in the middle of the Pacific.  He has not met another person in his entire life.  He does not know about Republicans and Democrats, and certainly not Libertarians.  He can't even say he is ""independent,"" because he doesn't know about the existence of political parties.  You could say this person is a-political, meaning he does not hold a political belief.  In the same way, he's never heard of any kind of religion, so the word ""atheist"" means nothing to him.  He is not Christian, Muslim, Hindu, or anything else.  He is not religious.  It's not that he believes there is no God, but that he doesn't believe in God.

Third, you are also correct that atheists most often attack Christianity.  This is because Christianity is the most prevalent religion in Western culture, and it has the most effect on our lives.  It's not that we have a vendetta against Christians any more than we do against Muslims or any other religion.  Atheists are wounded just as deeply by attacks from Islamic Fundamentalists.  It's just that these attacks only happen rarely, and that we feel the greatest immediate threat to our way of life comes from the far Christian Right.  I'm not talking about Christians like Mr. Coleman, who organized a voluntary and harmless religious event, I'm talking about Christians like Ted Haggard, who preached on the evils of homosexuality and then participated in homosexual acts; or Fred Phelps, whose church displays signs that say things like ""Thank God for dead soldiers.""

As an atheist, I believe most Christians are fundamentally good people.  I support the good side of Christianity; it's the bad side I have a problem with.  This goes for all religions.

Unfortunately, I probably won't be able to listen to your show again, as I am only a temporary resident of Huntsville, but I would greatly appreciate it if you could discuss some of the points I've made on your show so that your listeners can understand atheism better and fear it less.  Again: most of us do not want to stamp out religion.  We only want to see the end of evil.  We're on the same side!

May nature select you!

EDIT:  I'd like to address some of the issues mentioned in the comments.

First, considering my statement about ""pure"" atheists: I made that statement intending to make the point that there are no truly pure atheists: pure atheism means 100% certainty that there is no god, and because one cannot be 100% certain, no one can be a pure atheist (although some may claim it).  This point was made by Richard Dawkins in The God Delusion when he was explaining atheism and agnosticism.

Second, yes, posting a bulletin on the school website did show endorsement and thereby violated the establishment clause according to precedent.  However, it was taken down after FFRF complained, and no further violation was committed.  No precedent has been established prohibiting school property from being *used* for a third party religious event, only from endorsing it.

After some consideration, I think the fact that the organizing party happened to be a government official does put this in a gray area.  Is it wrong for government officials to be leaders in their religious community, and/or publicize it?  Or, as this man did, use their specific government power to obtain resources for a religious event, as seems to be the common perception?

Third, I now realize that the man on the island was a poor example.  What would be a better way to explain that atheism is not a religion but a lack thereof?

Thanks to everyone who gave constructive criticism!

EDIT #2:  There was a request for Rick's response, unedited:

""I wish you would remain in our audience you will be missed….thank you for your email and I really appreciate that fact that you understand the establishment clause. So many who claim your incorrect title of ""atheist""  as you correctly pointed out you are actually agnostic, but I digress most who share you lack of belief don't

understand the establishment clause.  The founders simply did not want a state run church like they had under the king of england.

Whereas the primary effect I would believe any secularist to aim for in a debate would be to convince the theistic portion of an audience to question their faith (as the secondary being to reinforce the secular portion of the audience, for which there is already overwhelming literature that is more thorough), the theistic audience is probably more likely to attend for the sake of supporting someone who champions their cause, as theism is primarily valued as an agent of comfort and reassurance. 

The secularist must obey the laws of logic which his/her very argument rests upon, while the theist continues to put forth false premises and misinterprets various fields of science for the sake of their argument to reassure those who are likely not to possess the educational fortitude to refute (much less question) the points made by the apologist.

In response, he told me that he read that whenever a Liberal doesn't know what to say in an argument, they resort to calling their opponent racist, sexist, homophobic, or bigoted. I told him that I had a solid argument against what he was saying but that his argument also happened to be sexist. He said he would not listen to my argument because I was only going to call him one of the things mentioned above. 

I became extremely worried because I realized that anyone with that kind of mindset will always believe that if someone calls him bigoted, then that automatically means that he's not a bigot. Now he won't listen to my points of view because I'm only proving him right by calling him out when he says things that are bigoted.

Side note: The book that he got this idea from is called Still the Best Hope by Dennis Prager. In order to learn more about where he got his ideas (he swears by Prager) I read the book (in return for which he is currently reading The Greatest Show on Earth by Richard Dawkins). In this book, Prager doesn't just say things that are exaggerated, he says things that are factually wrong. Some examples include: Liberalism is a religion; global warming and climate change are the same thing; atheists cannot be moral; for a government to be good, god must be a central part; etc. 

What I'm doing here is asking for your advice on how to debate with him. How can I ever get my point across that he's being bigoted if calling him out on bigotry convinces him that he's not a bigot?

____________________________________________________________________
So I know at least 2 A+ers IRL, including one who is a minor contributor to FTB. I won't say who, because it's irrelevant, and I basically only see them at social gatherings because we happen to move in similar social circles. 

Now, I've posted this elsewhere before, but I figure this new subreddit [*note: not /r/trueatheism*] would be a good place to put the slightly revised list. I won't bother linking to sources for the most part because [Ðavid A. Osorio S](http://www.skepticink.com/avant-garde/2012/10/13/atheism-plus-we-are-atheists/) and [John W. Loftus](http://www.skepticink.com/debunkingchristianity/2012/12/01/an-open-plea-to-advocates-of-atheism-plus-apologize-and-then-start-over/) of SkepticInk have done a much better job than I could.

1. As Richard Dawkins learned to his embarrassment, gathering atheists under a common banner (ie: the ""Brights"" movement) simply doesn't work. He likened it to herding cats. At one point, he posited that this could be because self-identified atheists tend to be inherently anti-authoritarian. Whether you agree with him or not, it's impossible to deny that the Brights movement pretty much imploded.

2. The ""leading voices"" of the Atheism+ movement (I'm referring specifically Richard Carrier, Jen McCreight, Rebecca Watson, and PZ Meyers) have all advocated heavy-handed censorship of their blogs, youtube channels, forums, etc. This doesn't sit well with me. I don't care if they think it's for the best, or they think they can be trusted with the power to control discourse. We laughed at the likes of VenomFangX for having to hide behind comment censorship, and rightfully so. Engaging in that same behavior is *not* a good start for your movement.

3. Taking trolls seriously. This is sort of a followup to the previous point. By taking Youtube commenters seriously (come on, they're YOUTUBE comments), you nourish them. You make them stronger. This doesn't just go for Youtube, either - the A+'s response to trolls is guaranteed to give them raging troll-boners, which only makes them want to troll you more. The only winning move is not to play.

4. The extensive use of ""you're either with us or against us"" language. Protip: there are a lot of people who default to ""against"" whenever they hear somebody lay down an ultimatum like that. I'm one of them. I don't care what your group stands for, or claims to stand for or against. Telling me that I'm either gonna stand with you or against you makes me think you're gonna use that card a *lot* to enforce ideological purity. Especially when you've already advocated censorship of dissent. And your movement is practically brand-new.

5. Ideological purity. I figured this would happen as soon as I started hearing the stuff in the last point, but I was kinda shocked how quickly this happened. A+'ers have said stuff like ""I don't want you marching next to me at a separation of church and state rally if you are against gay marriage"". Not only is this highly counter-productive for any social movement (who cares what their position is on gay marriage? It's not a gay marriage rally, and if you share things in common, you might change their mind on that issue. Besides, social movements tend to not be in a position to be choosy as to who their allies are), but it's virtually guaranteed to lead to ideological purges. As soon as a prominent somebody in the A+ community gets a bug up their ass about something -- gun control, gendered bathrooms, net neutrality, the capital gains tax, CO2 emission standards, etc -- that's gonna be the new thing that everyone will have to agree on. Are you an A+er who has no interest in even discussing any of those issues? You'll be cast out, and then they'll start searching for the next batch of ""pretenders"" in their midst that threaten the purity of their movement.

6. The presumption that they have a monopoly on ""compassion"" and ""equality"" is arrogance of the highest order. This is reason enough for me to steer clear of them. Groups that have that kind of arrogance make me nauseous. 

7. When all of this is combined, people have legit reasons for wanting to stay away from Atheism+. But if you dare make that decision, [Richard Carrier thinks you're a douche.](http://freethoughtblogs.com/carrier/archives/2207/comment-page-1#comment-20128) This one alone is enough to make me run from your movement. Seriously, having no idea at all why this guy doesn't want to join (maybe he just doesn't like *you*, Richard), you call him a douche for abstaining. That's pretty douchey behavior, Richard. Way to represent your movement.

8. When faced with the inevitable pushback (and internet trolls) from all of the above, they dare play the victim card. Really, people don't like any of the above behavior because they dared advocate ""compassion"" and ""equality""? This just proves they have paper-thin skin and will resort to calling anyone who disagrees with you a misogynist or a douchebag. Protip, A+ers: resorting to that kind of emotional blackmail makes me not even want to sit next to you on the bus, let alone join your club.

9. The hypocrisy. Censorship of dissent (even unreasonable dissent), over-sensitivity, arrogance, childish name calling, emotional blackmail, divisiveness, and casting out apostates are all behaviors that these people I used to respect (like PZ and Matt Dillahunty) rightly mocked and criticized religious groups for. But to these A+ers, it's different when *they* do it. Because they think they're *right*, and that means they're different, and better. As if the same standards they hold everyone else to don't apply to them. And that is behavior I cannot abide.

So there it is, Atheism+. That's why I want nothing to do with you. So call me a misogynist (I'm not), call me a douchebag (I'm not), call me an asshole (I'm... okay, that one is true). I've been called far worse by better people.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1d6ek8,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1d6ek8/9_reasons_why_atheism_is_doomed_to_fail_and_why_i/,

We tend to get into heated debates when religion comes up.

The other day she sends me an email asking me to answer 2 questions:

1. Fill in the blank: God is ________

2. Why do you believe in evolution?


This was my response:

-----------------------------------
1. God is...

God is the remnant of our primitive and superstitious ancestors. Or as Neil DeGrasse Tyson put it: God is an ever-receding  pocket of scientific ignorance.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HooeZrC76s0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=89s


2. Why do I believe in evolution?

We need to establish a few things. 

The theory of evolution does NOT have a say in the origin of the universe. That science is called cosmology.


The theory of evolution does NOT have a say in the origin of life. That science is called abiogenesis. 

Evolution is the theory that explains the diversity of life on earth. 

That being said - I believe evolution is true because it contains the most evidence and explains the diversity of life. It is demonstrable through science. The scientific method and the peer-review process ensures that all the data and evidence is accurate. How? The scientific method generally works like this:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method 

The fact that evolution has been observed and that there are mountains of evidence to support this theory makes it hard to deny. A list of different species that has evolved is here:

http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html

Remember, the list at the bottom contain sources, meaning other scientists and researchers have replicated this observation accurately, therefore has been published by a reputable scientific journal.

** If ANYONE had ANY evidence that evolution is wrong; they are welcome to present evidence; collect their Nobel Prize, turn the entire scientific community on its head and also ensure that his/her name goes down as one of the greatest scientists to ever live! **

Lawrence Krauss says that it is silly that the Bible states that God created day and night before creating the sun. Dinesh D'Souza responds by saying that the problem is that Krauss is reading the Bible in a fundamentalist way, and that very little contemporary Christians read the Bible in such a literal manner.

Now, I have several presumptions that leads to my question in the heading.

1. God is omnipotent and omniscient. 
2. An omnipotent and omniscient God would be able to dictate a book perfectly, without ambiguity, through divine inspiration in the minds of earthly writers. 

With these two presumptions, is it unreasonable to suggest that either the Bible is entirely correct and must be taken at face value (and so no picking and choosing!), or that small errors are a massive dent in the armor of the claim that the Bible is the word of an omnipotent God?

Early in my teenage years when I was a Mulder-type Agnostic (I want to believe!), I explained the errors and contradictions away by using the stork analogy: Just as a parent explains to a child where babies come from by using the story of the stork instead of sex, so did god explained creation to his creations through the stories in the Bible. I don't think many will disagree that the Big Bang theory and DNA and such will be viewed as insanity due to the ignorance of bronze age peoples.

But then again, the book is supposed to be about ""how religion poisons everything"", not about why there probably are no deities... I guess it's probably appropriate that he focused on the hypocrisy of real actions performed by religious people.

I had major respect for Hitchens before I read this book, and I still have that respect for him. But it seemed like he gave more than one too many anecdotes of cult activity and that didn't strike me as being as hard-hitting as it could have been, or as hard-hitting as I expected from Christopher Hitchens.

Nevertheless, the man is a brilliant and witty writer and the book was filled with many good arguments. But every time he was nearing a truly interesting topic which he could have stayed for a while to give us more perspective, his writing took a turn in a different direction and instead he just began another anecdote.

I live in the southern United States so I'm a minority in that sense. It seems like if the topic ever comes up with my family, friends, or just random strangers they immediately try to force me into a defensive position.  I don't believe in gods because I don't think there is enough evidence to support it, and I don't go out of my way to research EVERY SINGLE Christian apologetic source, ""Christian science"" claim, historical claims, etc.

A few examples:

You don't believe in God? I bet you didn't know that George Washington said ""A nation cannot be run without God and the Bible.""

You don't believe in Jesus's claims of divinity? Here's what X scholar has to say about that!

This scientist says all of the evidence points towards a creator, *proceeds to spout what is surely a load of garbage.*

Quite frankly it makes me sick. I really don't think about religion or lack thereof much at all during my day-to-day routine, and I feel like I should rightfully be offended when people gang up on me with psuedoscientific / other potentially fake claims.

I began attended frequently. Most of the time it was to visit interesting people who congregated there and sometimes it was rather enjoyable. The Pastor's sons were well enough and although the preaching was nothing I hadn't heard a million times before, at the very least at the end, laughing and joy filled the halls of this tiny Baptist Church. 

I learned that everyone has their own different version of their christianity, each with it's own unique set of beliefs. I found that most fascinating and most of them were very tolerant of my atheist/buddhist/taoist beliefs. I described myself as an agnostic atheist; I don't accept any god claims thus far and have no reason to believe them unless another claim backed by reason or evidence other than testimony would make me reconsider. Nonetheless, they accepted and welcomed me and treated me as good as their fellow Christians and didn't preach to me at every turn. She however...was different. 

For some reason she constantly preached to me or placed off hand comments about her religion in subjects unrelated. I let these slide, after all, I was accustomed to it. But eventually it became extremely vexing. I woke up one day to realize that this great religion of ""peace"", although offering a barometer to some, hope to others, was becoming poison to her. 

The girl I was starting to really adore was kind, unconditionally so. With honor and a deep sense of right and wrong. She was the type to talk to lonely people or people that seemed lonely just because. She was beautiful. If there was a god and he was god I'm sure he would've fashioned her nature after his. But slowly, after visiting the more... ""traditional"" congregations on sundays by a very zealous pastor, I witnessed her become slowly and slowly more inured by his teachings. He became increasingly militant. Anti-atheist, anti-choice, anti-everything. Damn all who disagreed or though differently, for they are sinful and he is the only one with the right answers. 

This was typical, but then I witnessed the horrible effects this has on genuinely good people. I watched a beautiful but damaged girl look up to a man for refuge because of her emotional wounds, and slowly changed. Insecurity got the better of her, and nothing disguises insecurity quite like faith. She was the only member I spoke too who cannot defend her beliefs, as well as the only one who truly parrots everything dear Pastor says. Those streaks of kindness became less and less frequent. And even when they happened they came at the ransom of a sermon. If the sermon was ineffective, she'd leave them. 

Told me how beautiful it was that I cared more for her than I did my beliefs, but was left in the shadow of hers; she couldn't return it, nor did I expect her too. I watched myself growing extremely anti-theistic, and now, quite frankly speaking, the idea of her God existing is not only far-fetched, but appalling to me. In the end, I lost her and I feel horrible that I allowed her to taint my growing respect for the religion that breeds intolerance. Do any of you have any similar stories or experiences?

I thought that I'd put this here, as it's something that I have found very comforting when thinking about my (hopeful) old age and (inevitable) death... I'd be interested to see what people think - is this something that others find comforting? 

It comes from a section in Jean Liedloff's *The Continuum Concept*. She bases the book on her time living with the Yequana Indians in South America, who have a 'Stone Age' level of technology. She compares their life with that of westerners, and wonders why ""Real joy, the state in which the Yequana spend much of their lives, is exceedingly rare among us"".

The book is dated now, and there have been many criticisms of it, but I found that the following passage really resonated with me. Liedloff explains that the Yequana accept each age of life as it comes, neither rushing towards milestones, nor trying to stay in an idealised youth as they age.

I'll quote the whole passage:

&gt;Babyhood desires give way to those of the successive phases of childhood and each fulfilled set of desires gives way to the next. The desire to play games fades away; the desire to work becomes increasingly strong as one becomes an adult; the desire to find and share life with an attractive member of the opposite sex, fulfilled, gives rise to a desire to work for the mate and to have children together. Maternal and paternal motives develop towards the children. The need to associate with one's similars is fulfilled from childhood to death. As the needs of adults in their prime to initiate and carry through their projects become fulfilled and age begins to reduce physical powers, desires are foreseeing one's loved ones succeed, for peace, for less variety in experiences, to feel that things are moving through the cycle of life with less help from oneself and ultimately, with no help, as the last of life's succession of desires is fulfilled and is replaced by none but the wish to rest, to know no more, to cease.

&gt;In every phase, founded firmly upon the completion of the preceding ones, the stimulus of desire received its full response. There is, therefore, no genuine advantage of being young over being old. Each time has its particular joys, and after one has relinquished each set of desires as it runs its course, there can be no cause to envy the young nor to wish for any age other than one's own and the pleasures it brings with it, up to and including death.

(Liedloff makes a generalised assumption about the 'opposite sex and parenthood' route though life, but the principles are the same for any route.)

Society seems to bombard us with the idea that young adulthood is the ideal age, and that we should be rushing forward to it or struggling to keep it. That we would be happy if we were 18 for ever with all the things that brings - sex, freedom, expansion, struggle, learning. 

I'm glad now that I'm not stuck in the 'paradise' I would have imagined when I was 5, or 10. My paradise is doing the sort of things that I want to do now! I can't imagine reaching a stage of life when I happily want to die. But when I was 5 I didn't imagine I would ever want to leave home or kiss boys.

American atheists on here (who were raised Christian) seem to have been exposed  to a very different kind of Christianity to the british. Whereas in the US you can hear stories like [this]( http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1c1sc0/this_actually_happened_at_a_christian_summer_camp/c9ca6ku
), in the UK it tends to be a much milder, gentler form that is easily shed later in adult life. 

I’m in the unique position of having grown up in both the southern US states and then moving to England when I was still a kid, and I can easily point out several huge differences in the Christianity that I was exposed to, namely:

1.	There is a great deal more ‘taboo’ in the southern US. I had friends who were banned from playing with TMNT toys and owned Bibleopoly instead of the normal capitalist version.  Many churches go through new popular phases of banning certain parts of pop culture, i.e. Harry Potter. In the UK I can’t remember this ever being a thing or among any of my British friends

2.	I went to a British Church of England primary school, and though we were given Christian hymn books to sing from and  told bible stories in assemblies and the like it was never in a negative way or felt like we were being coerced into Christianity. When I later went to American ex-pat teenage church groups there was a huge emphasis on being ‘saved’ and not doing this or that (obviously, this was when the first seeds of doubt were planted in my teenage mind by Satan) and felt very pushy. 

3.	People that have grown up in the UK, even though largely exposed to Christianity in their youth, seem to have a tendency to give it up later in early adulthood, and do so without thinking about it much, whereas in the states I noticed many of my childhood friends it’s (generally) a much more traumatic and very conscious decision on their part to de-convert.

 I am an atheist, but an extremely religiously tolerant one. I think that there is beauty in religion and mythology. Delving into the different cultures of the world and their belief systems is a passion of mine that actually resulted in my Children's names. (I have the name of a Greek goddess as well.)

 I would never try to dissuade or deter anyone from their chosen belief system, I just simply do not believe in any of them or deify any of them for myself.

 My community is not a very religious community and my kids have never really been exposed to religion other than participating in community events celebrating diversity and different cultural/religious celebrations. Diwali is super-fun etc.

 One of my children though over the past few years has independently developed and maintained a very firm belief in god. I have of course supported him and said that it's a wonderful thing that he believes in god, good for him and he can believe in anything he wants. (Says the Mom with the FSM decal and ""Got Cthulhu?"" bumper sticker on her soccer Mom minivan...) *I* almost wish I had such sweet childish faith in something like he does. It's very sweet to see.

 He's not stereotypically Christian, doesn't really know of or believe in Jesus or anything. He just believes very strongly in god. And he's more than a little sad that I don't believe. His siblings don't believe and he quietly defies them whenever it comes up. ""I believe in God."" ""I just believe, that's why.""

 I feel like (or worry) he feels like a bit of an outsider. He knows that I'm an atheist and his mostly-estranged Dad is agnostic at best.

 I don't want to take him to church because I don't know if I want to subject him to religious indoctrination or peer pressure. I try to show him that there are many gods and all are just as important to the people who believe in them and he doesn't seem to want to pick one- he just believes.

I was born into an irreligious family with Catholic grandparents, my grandparents brought me up for most of my life but NEVER pushed their beliefs onto me. My transition to atheism was: Irreligious &gt; Agnostic &gt; Atheist. 

Recently there has been a death in the family, so my family is naturally bringing and invoking God at certain times, one of my grandparents bought a card of that ""One set of footprints"" thing, ""Through the hard times there was only one set of foot prints, where were you then?"" ""I was carrying you"" type of thing, my grandparent asked for my opinion and I just nodded and smiled. I wouldn't want to recieve that card personally but the family is Catholic so I've got no problem with it.

Over the past few days I've been with my grandparents and I'm starting to feel a little uneasy with all the religious stuff, I personally think it's all nonsense but they are devout. I can't imagine what it like for the people living in the American Bible belt, it must be torture (I'm not American).

In order to get some ""release"" I come online and view atheist videos on YouTube and on Reddit to get a sense of normality. But I've come to decision that I don't want any part of the Catholic religion itself, even being in the environment for a while is something I'm definitely not a fan of.

I'm in my early twenties, I'm an atheist and I don't see myself becoming religious in my life at all, and I'm completely fine with that.

I'm extremely happy about not believing in any Gods, it feels liberating to know that I'm going to live my life and then die and nothing else will happen, I'm not afraid of death and I don't believe in miracles or prayer. And it feels fucking brilliant.

They were often understood to be either castrated men, *men who had no natural desire to marry or procreate*, or men who became celibate for god.

1336930743.0,101,self.TrueAtheism,tl6mp,Yay or Nae? Heavy criticism of religion is not analogous to disrespecting freedom of religion.,AnOnlineHandle,113,12,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/tl6mp/yay_or_nae_heavy_criticism_of_religion_is_not/,"In the past, we had to come up with the idea of freedom *from religion*, due to theocratic oppression via the state, as well as incompatibility between groups which claimed different divine laws. This meant that group members of one religion could and should not attack another.

However, freedom of religion has been inappropriately (this is my assertion) carried forward to now assert that religion, and religious claims, thus have an inherit social freedom *from criticism* - and people (often atheists) get quite flustered by criticism of religion, citing the breaking of this social normalcy. Atheism is judged as another religion, which it is not.

When we meet a chain email spreading an urban legend, we are all happy to go to [snopes](http://snopes.com/info/top25uls.asp) to refute it. Same with alternative medicines without controlled test evidence, or claims about conspiracies, UFOs, false stories invoked by partisan politicians, etc. Anything is up for criticism, it is not considered intolerant to take apart an assertion in that arena, because it is recognised that people from outside the arena are not fighting over two of the same thing - they are responding against bad claims which don't stack up. Everybody is happy with this, nobody would call de-constructing and highlighting the absurdity of the Obama birther conspiracists as invalid or undesired for being 'belief' intolerant.

As atheists are not religious, we come from completely outside the normal game. We don't have another god to assert for an impossible battle of theology which must be avoided for civilization to survive. We have outsider's criticism of the whole nature of religion, the credibility of the original sources in each one, etc. We are not one religion battling another, we are more analogous to those who highlight the historical flaws in an urban legend via efforts such as snopes, or show absurdities in ancient astronaut claims, or find weaknesses in a scientific hypothesis to move human knowledge forward, or recognise that a compulsive gambler has an irrational bias with believing that they are going to win, etc. Society hasn't been trained to criticize any of these attempts of standing up to weak assertions - normally we would applaud it - but people are embarrassed by criticism of religion due to the carry-over of the idea that religion shouldn't be criticised, that is has a special exemption (and it makes sense between religious people, yes, but *not* between religious and not religious people).

Some will say that they know religious people who are charming. It doesn't matter if a 9/11 truther is nice, charming, etc, on the outside - charm is often confused with a decent argument - the core claim is still up for full criticism regardless of whether the 9/11 truther is now wearing a tie and has improved the quality of their conspiracy website. Especially if they are leading to enormous real world influence, and are teaching these claims to children.

Saying that atheists who criticize the claims of religion are akin to regular interfaith intolerants, in a sense reminds me of the false but common analogy of [militant atheists](http://dawgfarts.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/militants.jpg) - useful if you goal is demeaning by false comparison, but logically invalid.

This is, in a sense, a criticism of those who criticise /r/atheism for making the same 'mistake' of faith intolerance. One faith is not being measured against another here, except by the few gnostics. What I want people to admit, is that poor assertions are just being torn apart as they in any other sense (religion just happens to be one of the most enormous, and far reaching, of these - usually often having been heavily involved in the lives of the people who post there).

TL;DR - There is an old idea around that religions shouldn't criticize each other, this doesn't apply to atheism, because atheism isn't a religion. Atheists' criticism of religion should be responded to no differently than everybody's criticism of conspiracy theorists, alternative medicine pushers, UFO claimers, etc.",,False,,t5_2soy6,True,,,True,t3_tl6mp,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/tl6mp/yay_or_nae_heavy_criticism_of_religion_is_not/,

Pakistan. The peaceful and tolerant religion I was born in, and which the majority of my countrymen follow, has this oh-so-peaceful and just punishment for people who apostate. You guessed it! Execution.

To be fair, this punishment is not part of the constitution. But the religious nut-bags in Pakistan don't really follow the constitution, do they? Most of them are only too glad to earn their ticket to heaven by hunting down and murdering acquaintances, friends and (yes) family members who have become the ""servants of Satan"". 

Therefore, understandably, not many people, including myself, admit to being an atheist. In addition, we also have to maintain a ""camouflage"" of religiousness by occasionally following the religious practices followed by pretty much everyone here.

I've been an Atheist for more than two years now. I personally have not told a living soul of my real beliefs. Not even my family. (Quite frankly, it takes quite a bit of courage to admit it even here. I hope my government; or worse, the terrorist agencies!; don't have some NSA-ish surveillance program or something.) And I'm not the only one in this situation (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion_in_Pakistan). Anyway, recently I've run into a bit of a paradox.

Am I really an Atheist? An Atheist is someone who thinks freely, acts freely and speaks freely. For me, only the first part holds true. I am forced to follow the conventions of the corrupt society I live in in order to survive. I cannot speak everything I'd like to. I have to occasionally follow religious practices to maintain the camouflage of religiousness, at least in front of my family. But in my mind, I am free. I can think whatever I want. My thoughts are neither influenced, nor corrupted by any religion or set of beliefs. I am a free-thinker and shall remain one till I die.

However, since my irreligion is only (for now) restricted to my thoughts, can I really, honestly, call myself an Atheist?

(Posted in /r/Christianity as well, but wanted some more perspective on it)",username1X,121,27,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1gs5s2/how_am_i_not_supposed_to_be_offended_posted_in/,"So, quick background on me: I'm an atheist. Told my parents about a year ago (Some time around August/September). I had been in nursing school at the time and the pressure of it along with my spirituality conflicts had made me irritable to be around, so I wound up blurting out what was wrong with me and told them. Anyways, in December, I failed a class and got kicked out of my nursing program, I've been jobless since then, but not for lack of trying. I had applied for a temporary summer job at a place I'd worked at twice before where the boss and all the supervisors and co-workers liked me, and was expecting to be hired sometime early in June. I planned to work there as long as I could, then take a CNA (Certified Nurses Aide) class and start CNA work and hopefully get into another nursing program. I called my old supervisor yesterday about the job and he told me that they'd hired people in May and didn't even see my application (I do have proof that I submitted the application, so that's not an issue). Anyways, I was really let down at losing this job prospect, because I was basically told when I called that if the hiring supervisor had seen it, I would have gotten the job.

So I told my parents about this turn of events and my mother, who had seemed to be fine with my religious beliefs ever since I told her about them, said that she believed the reason my life was so shitty right now is because ""[I] turned [my] back on God, and now he's punishing [me]."" Obviously, I was mad and offended, because it was so dismissive of my personal beliefs, and it made it seem like I was being punished for not taking a leap of faith when, personally, I have no proof of a god that would be punishing me for a lack of belief. I've never said a word to either of my parents criticizing their beliefs and have generally avoided the topic of religion altogether since revealing my beliefs, having made it clear that I don't have a problem with Christianity in general, as long as those practicing it are decent people.

Anyways, I retreated to my room and my mom came in to tell me that she meant no offense by what she said. She kept trying to explain what she meant to say, but had a difficult time which resulted in her basically just making the point that I had revealed my atheist beliefs and shortly after, my life began to suck more than usual, basically saying that the two were related, but that I shouldn't take any offense.

So, my question to you: Is there really any way that my mom's statement isn't offensive? It'd be like me telling her that she has a bad life because she didn't pay her dues to Shiva and the rest of the Hindu gods. The way I see it, it's a belittling statement, making it seem like I'm either this delinquent who's rebelling and deserves what's coming to him, or I'm simply too stupid to see that I'm being punished and should blindly come back into the fold.

**TL;DR: My christian mother tells her atheist son (me) that my life is shitty because I turned my back on god, but I shouldn't be offended because even though it sounds offensive, she didn't mean it to be but can't reword it in a non-offensive way.**",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1gs5s2,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1gs5s2/how_am_i_not_supposed_to_be_offended_posted_in/,

We've gone to Latin Mass most Sundays since I was seven. I was raised memorizing the Catechism as part of my classes. I was taught many arguments for the existence of God, especially the five from Aquinas. I was also taught scientific reasons that the earth must be young, about 6,000 years; I was taught that young-earth creationism was the true scientific analysis of the data. I was taught that Catholicism is the most important thing, that to bring more souls to Christ was the highest purpose a life could have. The quote that stuck with me most was from a Louis de Wohl biographical novel about St. Thomas Aquinas: ""There are some things in faith which surpass reason; there is nothing which contradicts it.""
 
As you can tell, I valued science and reason quite highly. This ultimately led to the downfall of my faith.

In 2009, as a weekly series of facebook notes, I tried to prove creationism. I have two biologist friends, so this did not go well! Each week, they would explain why I was wrong. Eventually, I gave up temporarily to do more research.

I read two books, one recommended by each of my biologist friends: The Language of God and Finding Darwin's God. What I learned shook me badly. Evolution was scientific fact, as demonstrable as gravity when properly understood. I explained to my boyfriend, ""That was not my only reason for believing in God, but it was the one I thought strongest.""

After reading these books, I realized a conflict between evolution and the doctrine of Original Sin. Perhaps I had always known of this conflict and it was merely brought to mind in a new light. If Original Sin is the cause of suffering, why was there so much suffering prior to the event? I struggled with this question and asked around for an answer that made sense with both science and religion. I couldn't find one.

One Sunday, November 14 of 2010, I struggled to walk to Mass (I had an apartment at the campus Church at the time). I think I woke too late to go to the morning Mass. No matter, I would go to the 5:00. But I couldn't seem to get ready. The 9:00 Mass approached, and I struggled to prepare for Mass and move myself out the door. But I couldn't. Finally, in frustration, I pulled out my prayer journal and poured out my heart. I could not believe, for Catholicism no longer made sense. I could not attend Mass, for I could no longer believe. I begged God to help with my unbelief, to give me a reason to believe. I did not expect an immediate answer, but I hoped for something soon.

I got nothing.

For roughly two years, I looked for reasons to believe, reading mostly religious apologetic books. I was disappointed by many of them, for I tried to find scientific reasons to believe, and it seemed that all the authors I read who claimed to have them had a poor understanding of science. I found that the logical arguments were problematic, also. During this time, I graduated college and began my first full-time job (two hours from home). I was fired after 10 weeks, for doing all of the no work they gave me to do. In a stroke of great fortune, I found another and higher-paying job in a month's time. The transition involved a move to a different city also two hours away from home. My sister's reaction was essentially, ""I really feel God must want you in [that city]."" (She doesn't know the reason, of course.) I find this reaction insane. Why would He have put me in the first city in the first place? Why would He have let me get an apartment that refused to work with me when I lost my job (I had to get a lawyer to help me break the lease)? When I tried to voice these concerns, I received a reaction of ""maybe that was you"". This is even worse! I can't be expected to go through life blaming myself for everything bad and giving God all the credit for everything good - not and have any sanity!

In late October or early November 2012, I finally contacted the older of my biologist friends, the one I knew from my home parish, to admit that he was right about evolution. We began to discuss the problems evolution presents for Catholics. The encyclical Humani Generis requires Catholics to believe in a literal action committed by a literal Adam. However, we can scientifically prove that there could not possibly have been a literal Adam - natural selection works on a population level. There was never a population of humans numbering less than 10,000, so far as the entire species is concerned. I also learned that my friend had left Catholicism for atheism.

After this, I began to actively seek out and read atheist material. What I found was intellectually refreshing and surprisingly unbiased, in contrast to (for instance) Lee Strobel. One book in particular struck me: Why I Believed by Kenneth Daniels. He is a former evangelical missionary. He grew up believing much of the same things I did, and lost faith for much of the same reasons I did; that is, intellectual disagreement with the factual claims of religion. Despite losing his career and community, this man left his religion for atheism. The book describes his journey, how he fought against his doubts, and how he ultimately had no intellectually honest choice but to stop believing.

I was also particularly impressed with Why I Am Not a Christian by Richard Carrier. I realized that everything he says makes sense. In short, if there is an all-loving, all-powerful, all-knowing God who wants us in Heaven, why is there anyone who struggles with the question of whether that God exists? Even if He for some reason requires faith, why would faith be about whether he exists and not whether to follow his teachings? Plenty of people exist who act against what they believe is right; even I eat meat despite believing it is morally problematic due to it causing suffering. Further, why would this God require faith, but make people like myself who cannot have faith? I don't even believe my boyfriend loves me if he doesn't act in a loving manner for a while, and the same sentiment applies to everyone (this explains why I almost never ask for friendship when I actually need it).

These readings ended my transition, so far as my actual beliefs are concerned. I am no longer just a non-Catholic who went by the label atheist for lack of a better term, but I am an atheist. I wanted to believe, to keep from telling my family of my unbelief, to remain in a community. But I just can't believe what has so little evidence to support it, what is contrary to my reason. Because of this, according to Christianity, no matter how morally I act, I cannot be admitted to Heaven. When I realized this, it became another argument against Christianity. By Catholicism, I'm headed to Hell just for skipping Mass. By the rest of Christianity, I'm headed to Hell because I can't see any reason to believe anything in the Bible is anything but a work of men, including the gospels. By no means do I believe I ""deserve"" eternal happiness, but I cannot believe in a loving ""god"" who makes people who cannot believe, then punishes them for not believing with eternal torture. Realizing this has turned me to anti-theism.

I now consider myself anti-Catholic, and blame the religion for any of my psychological problems not caused by biology. I'm very, very angry that I was raised under what seem now to be very obvious lies, from homeopathy to Jesus to Hell to creationism. However, I can't blame my parents; they were working very hard to do what they believe is right. I have not yet decided how to deal with the anger and hurt caused by being raised as I was. There is no easy solution, especially as I was never taught a healthy way to handle emotion, only to take a shower, take some vitamins or sugar pills, eat a healthy meal, take a nap, and I'd feel better. Worse, I somehow gathered the impression that emotions are evil. This makes me more likely to bury them than try to have a healthy reaction to emotions.

Towards the end of 2012, my brother sat me down and questioned me about my relationship. He pointed out that my family could not support me marrying my atheist boyfriend, not because he is bad for me, but because he doesn't believe what they do. I explained a few of the reasons I had to believe in evolution, and a little bit of the other reasons I am no longer Catholic. He seemed surprised, if not overly so, and noted that my no longer being Catholic certainly helped make my relationship make sense. He also urged me to tell our parents. I did so the first weekend of 2013.

Their reaction was about what I expected. We talked for two hours, with me trying to explain my reasons and them trying to get me back into the Church. Mom said I had possibly ""gotten into some schizophrenia"". I was told to wear a brown scapular and pray the rosary so I could believe again, to which I responded that these actions would not change the facts of genetics. I was told that I was making a choice to leave Catholicism, which is false. I was told that I'm just trying to fit in with my friends, which is ludicrous (most of my friends are religious). I was accused by my father of being a feminist, and therefore not able to come back (I had tried to explain that I would reconvert for evidence). (When I told my bf this part, he was like, ""Aren't you the opposite of a feminist?"" because I WANT to be a stay-at-home mom.) They were extremely upset, of course, because in their worldview, atheists are the most immoral of beings and certainly going to Hell.

After I left, they must have called a deacon we know (formerly of their parish), because he tried to call me that night. I could not deal with another such conversation that day (I was fighting some sort of awful, two-week cold), so I texted him a bit but put off the actual call. About a week passed before I was able to talk to him. He said that believing in evolution requires faith, that there were too many missing transitional forms. He basically convinced my family that I am just going through a phase, a period of doubt, and that I'm still Catholic. (I am not happy about this, but I guess it is better for now.)

My sister lives on the other side of the country, so I had to call her also. My sister-in-law texted me while I was on the phone, encouraging me to not give her too much detail or something. I had already launched into an explanation of why I have come to the conclusion that evolution is true, though. My sister was, of course, extremely upset, and also told me I was going to Hell. Her pastor had recently given a homily (apparently) on why evolution cannot be true - something to do with God having said everything was good in the beginning.

My SIL, in the course of the texting conversation, claimed evolution was refutable. After we stopped texting, she posted three things on my facebook wall about why evolution is compatible with Catholicism (I think). I can't recall exactly how the conversation went, but I made a claim that suffering existed before Original Sin. She asked for proof. I posted several links showing that animal suffering is recorded in fossils that existed prior to humans. Her response was that animals don't suffer. I was livid. I don't know when I was last so very angry. (I planned to screenshot it for r/atheism to feed the anti-religious fire.) Around this time, my brother (her husband, not the brother who had sat me down earlier in the story) tried to call me. I did not notice the phone go off early enough to answer it, but I responded via text that I was not calm enough to be able to talk to him without insulting his wife due to her inane statement. Therefore, I would not talk with him at all for the time being. My sil's response was to remove her posts on my wall and send me a message about why she was unfriending me. She reiterated that it is a philosophical reality that animals don't suffer. She could have argued that animal suffering has no theological importance, but she didn't; she claimed that they just plain don't perceive pain as suffering. She seemed surprised that it could upset me that she made this claim. When she originally made the claim, it was worded in such a way that it could easily be extended into a claim that it is morally acceptable to torture infants, because she tied it to intelligence level, and many adult mammals (and some birds) have greater intelligence than human infants. In the course of this conversation, she claimed first that the theory of evolution's only purpose was to draw people away from God. When I debunked this by pointing out that fully half of evolutionary scientists are Christians, she retreated to ""evolution does not affect my daily life"", which is perhaps equally ridiculous.

It has become difficult to spend time with my family, because nothing they believe is true. It might be a little easier now that I don't have to hide this knowledge in every conversation, but I don’t really want to argue with my family every time I see them. I did refuse to attend the baptism of my niece born a month ago, because I cannot in good conscience support the raising of anyone the way I was raised and I see baptism as a symbol of the beginnings of that. I did not explain that this was my reason (the distance is a convenient cover-up excuse).

I'm still in a lot of pain because my family and even some of my friends cannot understand that I could leave religion without being angry at God. It feels at times that people are simply refusing to believe me when I explain my experience. I had evidence, so I believed; my evidence was debunked, so I stopped believing; I would believe again if given reliable evidence to do so. It seems almost nobody in Christianity can accept that this really is all there is to it. I've been accused of over-reacting for being in pain over being told I'm going to Hell by my mother, which has caused a strain in a non-Christian friendship.

I'm posting this because I need a place to vent, but also because I keep seeing posts where people are in relationships with people raised like I was, or considering those relationships, and wondering how to make them see the good news that there is no god. Hopefully, my story gives you some ideas. I honestly believe that if you can get anyone to the point where they are willing to open their mind even a little to the evidence for evolution or the arguments against religion, and they want to be rational people, they will deconvert.

Thanks to everyone who took the time to listen by reading this. I hope my story helps someone dating someone like I used to be.

I love all of it, the vastness of the universe, the complexity of the universe exploring itself, the concept of time, but one thing doesn't sit too well with me. 

Death. 

Fear of the unknown, fear of inexistance. As much as I'd like to believe there's a consciousness at the end of all of this, that it doesn't all just stop at any given moment, that (theism) doesn't make sense to me.

From where I stand, death is my greatest fear. No, that doesn't stop me from living my life, but it's caused a fair share of anxiety and confusion. My biggest hope for my life is that the Singularity goes through, so I have a shot a immortality. But realistically speaking, I *will*ndie some day. 

That's something I have to accept, but it's still scary. So, /r/trueatheism, how are you so calm with the fact that it'll all be over some day? Can you impart some wisdom on me, hopefully help me get calm on the topic as well?

What follows could well be totally wrong - it's based on an armchair interest in various theologies so I'd be interested to hear what is actually likely to be the case. 

In the secular/Christian society I was brought up in, questioning something because it didn't make sense wasn't a problem. And there is just too much about Christianity that doesn't make sense. It tries to do too much. 

It, as a religion, attempts to pack an entire universe into a unique being that simultaneously embodies contradictory parts. The problem of evil, of a single God's complete love and indifference for everything and itself, won't ever go away for Christians. It seems people either swallow the contradictions in their belief system for whatever reason, or they don't. But the choice is pretty stark from the beginning. 

I wonder if other religions suffer from this in the same way? 

In particular I was wondering about polytheistic religions like Hinduism. If you can outsource different moral parts and philosophies of the world and reality to different characters in your pantheon, is it much easier to 'make sense of things' psychologically, and in that way just let shit slide? (I apologise if I don't come up with a better way of phrasing this.)

When I was young and first learning that life kicks you in the teeth sometimes, I obviously turned to some external force to blame. But it quickly became apparent that Jesus's love and charm were going to be a lifetime coming, so there was no point looking there. A selfish point of view, perhaps, but it turned out I had evidence on my side. 

In a certain polytheistic society though, where there isn't one all-powerful being screwing things up, but a collection of forces vying for dominance, I could've maybe tied together my scientific knowledge of the world with my spiritual urges much more easily. 

My question is whether the theological burden that Jesus creates is just too much for a religion to carry over a certain period of time. Is it part of the reason that Enlightenment thought and reason erupted in Christian societies? Religions like Judaism seem much more open to reflection about whether God *actually* cares about us, and I don't know enough about the rest. But I'd be interested to find out.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1f5igq,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1f5igq/is_there_something_about_christianity_that_leaves/,

Now, I have had something on my mind recently. I currently move in Texas, pretty much one of the absolute most religious place in America. I have not always lived here, but for the 10 years I have been here I have noticed a lot of things.

My mom is from here (Texas) and she was crushed to find I was an atheist and cried in front of Subway for an hour while I tried to calm her down. Now fats forward a year to present time. I am a junior in one of THE MOST religious high schools. And while I have been here I have seen some of the cruelest people here. A closet gay came out and was pretty much shamed in to leaving school, a vocal atheist was nearly jumped by a lot of religious Christans claiming they were doing the act of God.

I personally always try to be nice and wouldn't hurt a fly, where had these people who are supposed to be ""little Christs"" run around calling people ""fags"" and the homeless man a ""lazy sinner"". I might also add there are confederate flags on the back of many people's trucks, which just bugs me personally. 

Anyways, I have been watching and it just seems they are a lot of intolerant and judgmental people. I am not saying all people are like this, just the majority. I fear saying I am an atheist here as I have no idea what could happen. 

All in all, my point is the fact that it appears we, as atheists, are far more tolerant of peolle and their beliefs then those who are supposed to be tolerant. Why is this?

*What religion (if any) were you taught OR subjected to (been around/grown up in) when growing up, by family.

*If you could give one (or a few) reason as to why you are what you are, what would it be? For the religious- Have you ever had any spiritual/mental epiphanies?

*In your own personal opinion, do you think you would be a different religion right now had your family subjected you to that different religion?

He's a Kantian by excellence (so let's call him Kunt).

Anyways, according to Kunt, one must dismiss any findings and arguments made by a morally questionable thinker (say the likes of Dawkins). **Based on a Christian perspective, the devil is always there to instigate deception and induce false teachings, leading to heresy, apostasy, and eventually atheism. For the sake of the argument, let's dismiss any resort to the burden of proof, and let's consider as probable the existence of his Christian God.**

I believe that the invalidity of Kunt's argument is difficult to prove, and I can't come up with any way to counter it. Now this whole thing doesn't necessarily have to be about Kunt. My question remains : **epistemologically, can his reasoning be considered valid ? Is there any flaw to it ?**

**Edit:** I blundered by forgetting to set aside the definition of morality. The issue is centered around epistemology considering the Christian God (and the Devil) may exist. Please also **keep in mind that we are dealing with a new kind of Christian faith, one more flexible through the use of Symbolism.**

**Edit 2:** Basically what follows from Kunt's biased assumption is that, since the Catholic Church indulges in relatively greater amounts of Charity, and since most atheist figures appear to be apathetic to the Human condition (I'd say they are more realistic), Kunt happily concludes that following the Pope should be the best epistemological way to attain knowledge, since he the Pope is less likely to be under the influence of an *hypothetical devil*. **I know, I know, this borders on the ridiculous, but this is serious, and you might start encountering more of these kind of ''educated'' arguments in the future.**

Anyways I'm grateful for the quick responses ! I'm leaving with better weapons in my theological arsenal...

**Edit 3:** Fellow atheists and redditors, you are assuming that every argument can be proven right, and science has all the answers instead of the good ol' Pope. I'm afraid you are assuming too much. Do not fall into the same pretension and arrogance religious people like Kunt fall into. **I repeat, Kunt is not the average Christian believer, he's a future physician for Darwin's sake. It's just that, faced with no scientific consensus on a subject, Kunt will rather follow the Catholic Church.**

His organization was very good, going from general statements to specific examples.  He also separated the chapters along the lines of each major religion, poked some holes in the human tendency to see patterns where they don't exist, and made a good argument for morality on it's own merit.  Toward the end though, I think he had a bit of a hard time wrapping everything up.  Lots of cool stuff he may have intended to put in the body of the book, but it didn't fit, so he put it in the end.  Outstandingly sourced.  I love books that give you references to other books the author would suggest you read.  If you've been thinking about picking this book up, I would highly recommend it.  

Any other folks out there have some recommended reading?

Or do they have to be mutually exclusive?,SingularityGuy,118,26,270,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/11f9rr/can_religion_really_exist_side_by_side_science_or/,"So I was on the internet (as always) and I came across a picture basically saying ""forget god, praise science"" and of course there was a flame war in the comments.

One of the people on there was trying to be a mediator of some sort had commented something along the lines of ""Why do we need to fight? Religion and science don't have to be mutually exclusive."" It was at this point, even though I had heard and thought the idea many times, that I realized he was wrong. Religion cannot co-exist with science. 

My thought was that: ""Science is a school of thought, not atoms, chemistry, not evolution or the big bang theory. Those are all products of science. Those are all products or practices of scientific thinking. Science is the art of critical thinking, and religion is all that science stands against. Religion can accept ideas of science, but it cannot accept science itself. Religion can co-exist with the theory of evolution, but scientifically no one can believe in religion. Why? Two reasons. 

1. The only evidence that one can get that proves religion are feelings and personal experience. Personal experience is always spotty and can be explained away by 'god works in mysterious ways' if it fails to prove itself (ie. prayer healing, etc.) and 'feelings' are not something to base decisions off of. 

2. God is an explanation for those who don't want to dig deeper. A true scientist, when he hits a wall in his research, does not say 'well, that's weird, must be god.' Doing that is detrimental to scientific thinking.""

So, what do you true atheists think? 

Edit: I worded my question wrong, sorry guys. What I was trying to ask is ""Can science and a BELIEF in god/religion co-exist"" Or does someone have to choose one or the other? Sorry about any confusion. 

Edit 2: Oh god (or lack thereof), we really need to define religion on this one. Well, I don't want to change it for anyone who has already stated it, so lets go with ""Let the speakers provide"". Same goes for the burden (Speech and Debate term, means what is required to win/loose).

Edit 3: Co-exist was the wrong word to use. I can't think of a good one right now, but what I meant was ""Not mutually exclusive"". Can you be both religious and scientific? Sorry about all of the misunderstandings. I need to work on my writing skills. 

Edit 4: I realized my job here is not to debate everyone, seeing as I don't have time for that. It's up to the people here to comment, and then the other people to reply.

When I was around 10, I got into church and youth groups, rallies, etc. The subculture was very out of step with the rest of society... No secular music, acting High on the Spirit, etc. Most of my closer friends were from church and it really affected the way I interacted and socialized with others. Some of the friends were pretty abusive. When I moved away from that town at 15, I never really got back into church but I had a hard time fitting in with others. As a latchkey kid, I grew to prefer small groups of close friends and couldn't stand large social events. I hadn't been exposed to a lot of things most people had, so I had no common ground. My sense of humor seemed odd to some people and brought on some social isolation. I've always been peaceful, friendly, and try to help, but somehow I wrecked it with some mannerism that didn't sit well with others. It took many years to figure out how to feel at ease socializing in a way that won't set me apart negatively. Now that I look back, I realize some of the people I used as role models were odd themselves. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Is there something that helped you along the way?

**EDIT**:  Got asked if I was homeschooled...Nope, not homeschooled. Just that I didn't have much contact with my family. Mom and Dad divorced when I was 10 and I spent a lot of time in church. That being my biggest influence, I thought that was the example of normal. I was a real bible-thumper. I knew it set me apart in school, but I was cheered on by the church group. When I moved, that support vanished and I saw more starkly how my behavior was seen as prudish and odd. It even brought on some animosity. Since I was raised firmly non-violent, I got bullied. Turn the other cheek only gets the other cheek slapped as well and invites more aggression. When I loosened up, I found freedom and went hog wild. Still, I didn't know how to correctly interact with others. I just found another wrong way. I got in a few fights at school and the bullying stopped, but I felt such guilt and shame for years. I still do. It took a long time to figure out social cues and nuances.

These are just a few tips.

**If you notice your opponent is raising their voice:**

The first thing to do id just remain calm. Do not get angry, just relax as the continue on. If you have a paper and pen on you take notes. After he runs out of fuel, just calmly begin your debate with ""I noticed that you're getting flustered"" then offer a glass of water.

Then you start dismantling there argument.

**If facing strawman arguements:**

In these it's important to listen to them as they speak, and find the first flaw in their argument. Write down the others, but the first flaw is usually the primary flaw.

Start by saying ""that is a good point, and it would be a serious argument; however, it is flawed in this aspect...""  

This shows you're not ignoring their points, but also displays your points/discrediting theirs.

**When facing logical fallacies:**

Do not start your argument by pointing to the name of the fallacy, just describe how it is false. Then say ""if you would like to know more information on &lt;logical fallacy a&gt; you can google &lt;formal name of logical fallacy a&gt;.

**ad hominem**

These are the most difficult to ignore, but you need to ignore them until after the debate. Then you approach them afterward and say ""hey, in our debate you said this and that, and i don't think you meant out seriously, but i found it offensive..""

9/10 you will get an apology.

**placing your arguments**

Make then clear, concise, and simple. Don't go into to much detail. Watch out for analogies, they can be a double edged sword.

**Facing rebuttals in general**

First, be prepared fire them.study the rebuttals and know how they can be dismantled. If your opponent hands you a bomb, show ours actually a water balloon.

**burden of proof**

""You need no evidence to prove nothing is there, it is your job to prove something is there, and its my job to show the flaws with your argument.

If I loom up ""atheism"", which should be generally defined as either ""lack of belief in a god"" or the Collins definition below, I am often served incorrect definitions instead. Below are the definitions I could find on short notice, accuracy varies:

Oxford Advanced Learners= ""Belief that there is no God.""

Merriam-Webster= ""a : a disbelief in the existence of deity.
b : the doctrine that there is no deity.""

Collins English Dictionary= ""rejection of belief in God or gods""

Macmillan Dictionary= ""the belief or theory that God does not exist""

Cambridge Advanced Learners Dictionary= ""Atheist: someone who believes that God does not exist""

Cambridge Dictionary of American English= ""the belief that God does not exist""

Webster's New World College Dictionary= ""1. the belief that there is no God, or denial that God or gods exist. 2. godlessness""

dictionary.com= ""1. the doctrine or belief that there is no God. 2. disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings.""

&gt;
A'THEISM, n. The disbelief of the existence of a God, or Supreme intelligent Being. Atheism is a ferocious system that leaves nothing above us to excite awe, nor around us, to awaken tenderness.

I realize dictionaries are behind the curve and slow to make adjustments to the definitions of the plethora of words whose usages keep evolving over the years, but both freethinkers like Charles Bradlaugh, Annie Besant, G.W. Foote, and theologians like Richard Watson, Robert Flint, Thomas Chalmers and others have been in agreement that an atheist is someone who does not believe in a god **not** someone who claims no god can exist since the 19th century... and they weren't even the first to define atheism as such.

Advice?,guiltyatheist,118,31,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1gmj3n/parents_making_me_feel_guilty_about_not_being/,"To provide a little bit of background on the story: A few weeks ago, I heard about a position teaching English in Taiwan. I forwarded on my resume and didn’t hear anything else about it. A few days ago, I got an email saying that I got the position and the departure date is in less than a week. I ALSO found out more about the program: mainly that it’s an English immersion Bible camp and that many of the activities used to teach English are “Gospel Parties” and “Spiritual Reach Out Sessions.” The schedule I received calls the few days that staff meet before the program start day “Mission Trip Orientation.” At this point, with such short notice, I feel like it’s too late to back out. I also feel like, religion aside, this is an awesome opportunity to travel and be exposed to other cultures. 

To get to the main point of my post:

My only concern is that this program expects me assume a role of spiritual leader that I feel unable to fulfill.  I explained this to my parents and said that I was feeling uncomfortable about that and the fact that the experience was religious based was never expressed until a few days before we leave. Although we were a very devoutly Catholic family, I questioned my faith in college and stopped going to Church. The more I reflect on religion, the more I find Christianity, and Catholicism in particularly morally apprehensible and illogical.

My parents were shocked and very offended. My parents didn’t go to college and never had a lot of money. They had made great “sacrifices” to send my three siblings and me to private Catholic schools from preschool until high school (my youngest sister still attends high school with a price tag of $7,000 per year) because they felt like that was the right thing to do. Essentially, they’re really upset with me and they’re laying on the guilt pretty thick, claiming that I’m wasting the sacrifice that they’ve made for me, which amounts to thousands of dollars. Although they didn’t say it directly, they also insinuated that I’m currently wasting the small amount of money they give me to help me pay for college (I’m paying for most of it with my scholarships and loans) because I’m throwing my life away. They don’t understand why I would be uncomfortable in a Christian environment and told me that I should not feel that way. 

Needless to say, I’m feeling pretty upset right now. I know that there’s no way that I would ever be able to embrace religion again and that I shouldn't feel guilty that my parents chose the schooling for me that they did. 

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of guilt tactics, from parents or other similar figures? Did you feel guilty about it or how did you work through it? Any advice would really be appreciated.

EDIT:

I didn't include the more specifics of how the job was presented to me since my main question was dealing with my parents. Essentially, the job was offered through email by one of the deans at my university. From what I understand, she is personal friends with one of the people who run this English camp. After I had sent in my resume, she left the country and never passed on anymore information about the job to me until just a few days ago, saying I (and two other students from the university) had gotten the job and the tickets were purchased for us. There was never any sort of contact between the university and Taiwan and myself.

I know this isn't a scam, as my university has sent students in the past. I can also easily google the camp program and see some of their skits from years past (I did not know about the name of the university or program when I applied for the job.) Essentially, I'd like to give the university in Taiwan the benefit of the doubt. I'm sure that they had sent information regarding the job to the dean of my university, who in turn never forwarded any of it on to me. The dean has again left the country and is ""unreachable"", as her final email to me had said. Sorry if that's kind of a confusing description.

It efficiently points out that the silly things which the religious once proudly said out-loud, particularly when they thought only those already on-board were listening, can quickly become taken apart when overheard by those of us well versed in counter-apologetics — a group whose participants have swollen considerably in recent years, thanks in large part to the social media revolution.

I'm old enough to remember the days before the internet, when the educational materials necessary for developing critical thinking skills, which I think inexorably lead to atheism by way of rationalism and the logic of scientific discovery, were the reserve of 'intellectuals'.  I'm also old enough to remember the impact which the work of authors such as Douglas Adams had, in their attempts to break the monopoly which philosophy and highbrow academia held over the non-religious question, when the social taboo of arguing against the assumed authority of the church began to appear in both mainstream political satire and in the alternative comedy of Margret Thatcher's 1980's Britain.

I point out that I am British — and that this is the time-frame in which I think the pre-internet age of atheism first began — for the simple reason that I think what happened here in the UK then, during that period of social mobilisation which in many ways eclipsed those of the 60's and 70's, may also now be happening on a truly revolutionary scale in the United States of America.  Where we had Spitting Image, and Alexei Sayle, America now has Jon Stewart and South Park — and, I suppose my reason for writing this, and asking some questions around whether or not my opinion is being unwarily coloured somewhat by the reddit effect, is to do with my hope that, across the pond, this much anticipated revolution in the way young Americans vote, think, act, and behave, isn't squandered on piffle and trash.

Top 10 lists on 'how to annoy Christians' and received opinion soundbites from loony lefties which play-well on YouTube are all very well — and it should be pointed out that there is, at the serious end of the atheism versus religion spectrum, a very encouraging viewer count on the hundreds of different video clips, many featuring Sam Harris and the late Christopher Hitchens, which suggests the number of Americans who now feel ready to openly espouse their atheist leanings are not being merely swelled artificially by devotees of Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins, who might just as easily have swung the other way had a charismatic figure with rather more conservative views captured the post 9/11 zeitgeist.

But I'm not the first to notice that many articles — particularly those hosted on the usual suspect blogs and subreddits, which once saw 300+ comments, and encouraged many fascinating opinions, are now either bereft of serious debaters, or get quickly bogged down with pithy put-downs and in-jokes.  And I worry that, while we might be tempted to think this decline in quality conversation is due to there being fewer and fewer people who go all the way back to debating religion in the days of IRC and UseNet; that same group who are now tired of having to turn a blind eye towards the sort of childish squabbling clearly posted by those who can't be bothered to take the time to develop a vocabulary which engenders constructive criticism, that we might also be missing another very important reason for the decline in provocative and serious debate around these issues.

The first possible reason for this, is that the religious extremists who balkanised Christians, for example, into groups based upon the traditional voting patterns of their State, but who now must compete with instantaneous and unfiltered social media of Twitter and Facebook, have returned to their core constituencies to regroup, and develop new ways of injecting their ideas into the conversation.  I point to the recent appeal by Eric Hovind, for example, for his few remaining followers to begin paying $10 per month to be included on a private mailing list, in order to receive propaganda materials he once gave away openly and free of charge.  

We should, in this instance, stay alert for far more subtle attempts to subvert the secular rule of law, than the outlandish stunts once associated with the anti-everything brigade, such as those attempts to inject creationism into the national teaching curriculum for science.  It's far more likely that the next move from those still committed to this ultimately doomed movement, will be imported into the United States from overseas — perhaps via the political manoeuvrings of organisations such as [Accelerated Christian Education](http://leavingfundamentalism.wordpress.com/accelerated-christian-education/), here in the United Kingdom, who have plans to open a string of so-called Free Schools, which under current legislation allow for faith groups to opt-out of national guidelines where religious objections to the teaching of certain subjects, such as biology, take precedence over the scientific consensus.

The second possible reason, as to why the religious seem more reluctant than ever to bring the fight to those of us prepared for the battle, is that without even noticing it, we have already won the war.  

Without going into too much personal information, for the past couple of weeks I've been working closely with a devout Muslim, who has subsumed so many values into his overall philosophy and way of thinking that chime with secular humanism, that any avenues into talking about 'it' with him that I might take, would make me the one who can't just 'let it go'.  What, for example, would be the point in me challenging him on what he believes and why he believes it, when simply in order to initiate this level of conversation I would be doing to someone else what I wouldn't have them do to me?  Moreover, what would I stand to gain on a personal level, from seeming to throw back in his face some of the extremely positive and pragmatic ways of structuring ideas, and delivering on ones personal ambitions, which I have learned from him, and which are explicitly informed by his faith.

I think we would all much rather live in a world where the second reason for the decline in the sort of day-to-day religious extremism which the 'new atheists' sought to challenge now seems to prevail.  Not only does it prepare us thoroughly well for any future attempts by the minority of extremists who might wish to reignite, but it enables us to see religious people as human beings, rather than some easily manipulated shell with no humanity of their own — which is, in my opinion, the way in which the likes of Dawkins would rather we thought about the religious people in our everyday lives, so as to better serve his narrative, as opposed to reveal the relationship between the religious and non-religious for what it actually is; a battle of ideas, where some are interested in the 'how', and some are interested in the 'why'.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1fxtjs,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1fxtjs/has_atheism_won_the_debate_or_have_i_become/,

It's hard to reason with circular reasoning like this.  The following is from the Clergy Project's facebook page, but it's the same conversation I've dealt with a number of times.

A fundamentalist (Aimee) has a conversation with a learned Clergy Project member (Dennis):

https://apps.facebook.com/forumforpages/203725383030148/309ee01e-6753-4810-b82c-29ad2748fd9b/0
&gt;**[Aimee]**Let me be the first to say (from the previous posts I've read) that it saddens me that if you are here because you have choosen to walk away from a relationship with God that those who protested to love you, shunned you. I am a professing believer and love all my friends, even the ones who don't believe. God also loves people regardless of whether or not they even believe He exsists. Make sure not to put all your hope and trust in man, who will ultimately let you down. And make sure not to base your decision to walk away based on bad teaching or theology. Thanks.



&gt;**[Dennis]**Thank you Aimee for commenting. All of the members of The Clergy Project have had extensive theological educations and spends years, sometimes decades preaching the teaching in their religious tradition. They certainly have not arrived at their positions due to bad teaching or theology. They have not reached their decisions lightly either. Most have agonized over their questions for years before finally acknowledging, often due to the extensive nature of what they do know, they cannot continue to believe what they have believed. - 
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Further, one of the gravest concerns they have and a situation which presents one of the most significant constraints for them is the response of other believers in their lives when their views become known. They are shunned, ostracized and treated with disdain. Rather than being contrary to their traditions, often the religious tradition itself condones, even teaches this very response to unbelief. Yes, it is very sad that this would be the case but it is all but universally true. - Dennis



&gt;**[Aimee]**  I love polite debate- or disagreements rather! :) I say bad theology or teaching and I do stand by the statement. One is able to receive a PhD in Theology and still have had bad teaching and then incidentally taught incorrectly. The Holy Spirit gives us the ability to discern the things of God and that comes from total and complete submission to Christ- can't have one without the other. That same Christ teaches us to love one another and put them before ourselves- which is what all Christ followers should do. We should always lead with love. However, as stated earlier- man is fickle and finite and the heart is wicked...best not to put all your eggs in that basket. The only thing that can overcome the sadness of people's cruelness is Christ- God loves us and sent Christ to die for us; Whether we believe it or not, whether we wish it true or not. Thank you so much for your time.


&gt; **[Dennis]** Ah, the internal witness of the Spirit that what you happen to have chosen to believe is actually true. If anyone disagrees then they do not have the Spirit or are not listening to the Spirit. If they agree then they have the Spirit. Of course, this is entirely subjective rather than objectively based on the actual text of the Bible as accurately understood from the original languages in the context of a deep and thorough study of the whole of all the documents that make up ""the Bible"". it is also a clever inoculation against questioning and criticism just as is the elevation of faith above reason.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It keeps one in the ""faith box"" by sweeping any questioning or intractable issue under the rug of ""you just have to have faith"" even though it does not make sense, or ""you just don't truly understand"" because you do not have the Spirit. Because, if you had the Spirit you would agree and believe but since you don't agree and believe you don't have the Spirit. Do you see how that prevents anything from being falsifiable, which is a hallmark of any rational inquiry?
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;One can dismiss the disturbing fact that people who are some of the most educated and knowledgeable people in the origin of the Bible and what it teaches have chosen, for that very reason, to no longer believe.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It is also a circle. You believe in the teaching of the internal witness of the Spirit because the Bible says so. Why do you believe what the Bible say is true, because of the internal witness of the Spirit. It is a vicious circle. No matter where you jump into the circle or how fast you run, it is still a circle and will not get you to the truth.

I'm constantly trying to walk a line between exposing religious lies and not being an asshole.

I hear many atheists say things like ""Religious beliefs are ridiculous, so why should you respect them? It's like respecting a grown adult's belief in Santa Claus!""  Honestly, if I knew a grown adult who believed in Santa Claus, and they built their entire life and meaning around that belief, I would respect it.  Sure, I'd definitely try to help them realize that Santa isn't real, but I would do it with tact and relatively respectful rhetoric. They're not believing in Santa to harm me, so why approach them with prejudiced hostility?

If a person's religion is their entire life's purpose, you cannot disrespect their religion without disrespecting the person himself.  Nobody deserves to be prejudiced this way based simply on religious affiliation.  Personally, I don't get too zealous with my beliefs in conversation unless someone wants to know what I believe or someone's religious beliefs are harming others.

They gave me everything I needed to succeed in life. And I have succeeded, even though I am only still in college. I have made good friends, have done well in my classes, have befriended faculty and staff, and have held many leadership positions within prominent groups on campus. All things considered, I have everything going for me and I should be happy. But I don't see the point anymore. 

I have always struggled with the aspect of religion and my atheism followed a typical path. First I rejected religion as an institute and only accepted the broader teachings of Jesus. That degraded to diesm, then to atheism. At first I struggled to see the point of life, but found solace in the unlikely fact that we were here and that life was beautiful. That feeling didn't last. 

I can't see the beauty anymore. Up until now I've done well hiding it. I simply bury it--smother it by suffocating myself in work. But that's no longer doing the trick. I do a lot of volunteer work to compensate. At first knowing that what I do is meaningful helped, but that's slipping as well. 

I no longer care about what I do. I recently was a part of a very large fundraiser that raised a lot of money for sick children. Some of them even came to thank us for our hard work. It was touching, but even though that happened a few short days ago, the feeling is wearing off. After all, no matter how much money we raise or how many people we help, there are still people suffering. There will always be people suffering. They will all die eventually. 

I am not afraid of death. I accepted my mortality a long time ago. What scares me is old age. I fear being useless. I fear being left alone, in a nursing home or hospice. I fear the slow crawl towards death that will most likely be my fate. Sometimes I wish for a tragic accident to cut my life short. Something sad that my girlfriend and family will mourn over, but something that couldn't be helped. Something they can recover from.

My transformation started with a single argument. 

When I was in a youth group Sunday school there was a debate that went on between the teacher (a woman I trust and love still, I consider her like a mother) and the youth group pastor (a typical one, young, energetic and would get down to earth with you) about ""once saved always saved"" (can you accept Jesus and fall astray and still get into heaven, like a one way ticket with no expiration). These two people, who I followed completely and held highly, were in leadership positions in the church yet couldn't agree on a pretty important topic. How many more posts of the Bible were this heavily dissented among those I trusted? Why was I following them, which one am I supposed to trust? It wasn't fair, they are both good people and I don't want to choose sides. This led me to start questioning everything, I started asking taboo questions, paying Devil's advocate. I learned way too quickly that half of them couldn't agree on most of the Bible, it was like a bipartisan debacle. 

A couple years later I found out my parents (who both had passed away by my 14th birthday) had gotten married due to a pregnancy. **Wait.** A child out of wedlock?! *My* parents? The perfect Christians who raised me? What the fuck? They lied to me about why they got married, they told me out was because my mother's family was moving and my dad just popped the question so they could stay together. They **lied** to me, their precious gift from God. I couldn't talk to them about it and it hit me so hard, I had so many questions, I cried in agony many nights, partially because I missed them, partially anger. 

More questioning. Question everything in my life, why, who, what... 

Where was God in this? He  wouldn't answer me. My conscious, who I had always mistaken for Him, couldn't think of anything, just empty feelings. 

This led to questioning sex before marriage. If my bastard sister was the start of what became my life, was the sin really so bad? I looked it up online, the ultimate tool for finding answers. Turns out out is very likely the Bible never forebode it. The word *pornae* was translated into ""sexual immorality,"" the term used so broadly now to promote abstinence. Why would they do that? ""Okay"" I thought, so sex isn't bad. I lost my virginity soon after and I wasn't struck down, awesome! It felt great and emotionally connected me to my SO, but I dare not tell my friends and family this, I would be discommunicated and hated. I kept to myself and pretended to go on as a good Christian, which everyone thought I was. 

Fast forward another couple years, I'm further in to college, and living away from home. It was a long struggle, at this point I considered myself agnostic with a distaste for organized religion. I kept trying new sins to see what they were like, I drank and partied, I cussed, I had *fun.* I was still a good person though, right? I felt a slight guilt still, and couldn't shake it. 

Then, on reddit, I found [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk6ILZAaAMI) video, and it rocked my world again. It just made sense, this is why prayer never worked. *Is there even a god or am I just praying to a milk jug?* Then I considered the unthinkable, I started looking into atheism and if it fit me. It was like Christmas, presents of knowledge lying at my feet, all I had to do was unwrap each bit of knowledge and inside was something that answered my questions from so long ago. I became am atheist. 

Yet again I dare not tell anyone, because *this* was worst than anything I could do spiritually. The ultimate defiance. 

What followed was a year of struggling with acceptance and how to tell others. 

I consider myself lucky to have accepting friends and family, because not a single one turned their back on me.

Whenever discussing atheism with a philosopher, they keep insisting that questions about god are metaphysical in nature. That empirical science can say nothing about the discipline of metaphysics and it's questions, but that the discipline of metaphysics has all the authority to talk about science. Anything else, in their book, is ""scientism"", the ultimate sin.

This always seemed to me like an ""ipse dixit"" fallacy. Why should all discussions of this kind start from the assumption that metaphysics is above everything else, science included?

For example, science might explain how the brain functions when it ponders the ideas labeled as metaphysics. But for the metaphysicist this is not relevant in the least, because they live in the higher spheres of thought, while science only deals with the crust of the ""true reality"".

How do they know there is a ""deeper reality"" beyond this thin crust they describe as perceived reality?

The idea that certain claims people make about metaphysics itself (such as the ones I make in this thread) are ""metaphysical"" is only a reassertion of the fact that the discipline of metaphysics has authority over every other. Just because a claim can be labeled as metaphysical from within metaphysics, it is still a circular argument to say that this proves the primacy of the endeavor.

Just because, from within philosophy, what I am doing now is terrible philosophy, this doesn't mean much. Because you have to accept the primacy of philosophy over other disciplines in order to accept it's conclusions.

I think speculations about what might be ""out there"" are fine, but they are literature, not a serious object of study.

Labeling certain classes of statements as ""metaphysics"" and ""physics"" and separating them into different departments (a sort of NOMA) is an unstated and unexplained assumption.

Why I love being a Muslimah. 

This post is being written as an answer to Megan who is planning on converting to Islam insha’Allah. She’s having the same troubles I had with my own parents (and am still having unfortunately) so I hope that what I say can be used to make her conversion much easier insha’Allah. 

First, I’d like to say that one of the biggest misconceptions I have found people have about Islam is that women are treated as subhuman or that they are “oppressed” by men. Do not confuse Islam with culture. The reality of it is that Islam raised the value of women, gave them a voice, protected them from cultures where it was, in fact, common to truly oppress women. If you look back in history to the pre-Islamic era, women were most definitely treated as having less value than men do. Unfortunately, this has carried on throughout other cultures, even today. Islam is trying to fight that. 

1. Men can’t get anywhere without us. Paradise lies at our feet. As related by Mu’awiyah, the son of Jahimah, Jahimah came to the Prophet (SAW) and wanted to join the fight against the Quraish, but The Prophet (SAW) told him “…remain in your mother’s service, because Paradise is under her feet.” And this has been related in other hadith’s as well, with the Prophet (SAW) repeating something similar to this. 

2. Hijab is made to protect us. It gives men a chance to stop judging us based on our bodies, and instead listen to what is in our hearts. Allah swt knew what kind of a world this place would become; He knew that women’s bodies would be exposed, made to be out as though we are play-things, and He wanted to protect us from that. From what society is saying our bodies should be like, because with hijab, people can no longer demean us for what our bodies look like, but for the way we speak and how we hold ourselves. 

3. Women are equal to men in Islam. The Qur’an states that “And for women are rights over men similar to those over women.” [2:228] Allah swt commands that we understand that men and women were created equal, repeatedly. The Prophet (SAW) also says “Women are the twin halves of men.” And again, the Qur’an says “They (your wives) are your garment and you are a garment for them.” [2:187]

4. Women can’t marry non-Muslim men in order to protect our rights. What other religion does that? It ensures that we will be treated the way Allah swt commands that our husbands treat us because a good Muslim man will uphold what the Qur’an and the Prophet (SAW) says. That cannot be guaranteed with a man who follows another religion that does not treat women as equal in the way that Islam does. 

5. Women come first in Islam. “As reported by Abu Hurayrah, a man came to the Prophet (SAW) and asked him, “O Messenger of Allah, who is the person who has the greatest right on me with regards to kindness and attention?” He replied, ‘Your mother.’ ‘Then who?’ He replied, ‘Your mother.’ ‘Then who?’ He replied, ‘Your mother.’ ‘Then who?’ He replied, ‘Your father.’”

6. There is a whole chapter in Islam dedicated to women. Al-Nisa’. What other religion can say that they have that?

7. Women pray behind men, yes. For a good reason. It does not symbolize inequality. It’s simply so that men aren’t distracted by us. Simple as that. A mosque, of all places, should never be a place of temptation. Even Allah swt knows that men’s heads tend to wander~

8. Women’s rights. ‘Nuff said. There is a list of what women have a right to in Islam. From inheritance to right to marry or to divorce to working. A woman’s rights are protected. 

There is so much more, but unfortunately, as I am just a convert myself, I couldn’t tell you the half of it. But there are an infinite amount of reasons as to why I am happy with my place in Islam. I love being a Muslimah because this is the only religion where, as a follower of our Prophet (SAWS) and of Allah swt, I know I am protected. Not only from the men within my own religion but from men on the outside as well. I’m always safe. Allah swt made sure of that. 

May Allah forgive me for any mistakes I’ve made. Insha’Allah this helps and others who are much more experienced and wiser than me can give you more and better input.

I initially considered posting this to debate religion, however frankly I find the critical discussion to often be a bit more robust in this forum.


As an ""evangelical-apologetic"" I place a good deal of emphasis on a philosophy best summarized by Thomas Jefferson,


&gt;Question with boldness even the existence of a God.  Because if there be one he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blind-folded fear.


Personally I find problems with Liberty University as a source to begin with, and beyond that I do not think the implied

 ""...historical information &lt;...&gt; accepted as historical by virtually all scholars...""  

reads quite as definitive as Dr. Habermas seems to imply.

So with that in mind I thought it might be an enlightening exercise to hold this against some of the thoughtful and penetrating critique I have come to find here frequently.


Opinions are always welcome (as if they could be avoided :) ); however my greatest hope is for cited contradictions to Dr. Habermas.  For two reasons...


1. One is because I simply find his article much weaker on cited support than the text implies...

I grew up in a small town.  We're a largely Republican/religious area.  My old wrestling coach is a very likable man, not for his personality, but in spite of it.  He speaks his mind and it's usually uncensored.  He has had the book thrown at him when it comes to insults.  Prick.  Asshole.  Etc.  But he's also got a lot of common sense viewpoints.  Oh, and he's a history teacher for the junior high school.

Anyway, a friend of mine (who I wrestled with, he's still in school) posted a message on facebook.  That is as follows:

""Look. If you're an atheist, agonistic, hindu, w.e, power to you for following what YOU believe in and standing up for it. But don't be a jackass and call other religions lies, as a Christain, I will not judge you for your religion. I'm a big believer in the book of Luke. But it'd be nice if you would show me the same respect as I show you and not mouth off about my religion.""

I replied in kind by saying that religion becomes a problem for me when it tries to dictate the direction of our country.  Now, I took what my friend would consider the high ground here, because I could have thrown a lot at him that showed his religion doesn't respect my disbelief.  Anyway, I posted that small message and went to bed.  When I woke up, my old wrestling coach had posted the following: 

"" I know Seiroku...I have to agree with you. I just hate it that atheist pretty much have controlled about everything this country has done in the last 40 years. I'm glad you have an issue with that too. I hear too many times that the Christians control everything. The sad reality is we have sat back watched as others have done what they pleased. The Founding Fathers developed founded this country on the Bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ. Shoot, Thomas Jefferson even commented several times on this in his various writings. Jeffersons principles come through very well in the Declaration of Independence. I could go on and speak historically but I won't...my point is many feel Christianity has ran this country as well as the direction. However, the truth is it is exactly the opposite. The atheist, irreligious libertines, madmen, and fools have all contributed to the decline of this country. All one has to do is go back and look at history to see the timeframe when we began falling apart. Then look to see what major events occurred during that time period. Sorry Jayden(the friend) for starting a firestorm...""

The message hasn't been edited except for my name and the tag by my friend's name.  I have respected this man for years, and as far as I can tell, he's saying that christianity hasn't affected the flow of american politics nearly as much as atheism and general religious disregard.

I've been an atheist for over a year now, and my boyfriend has recently come to terms with his lack of belief in the past few months. I've been very supportive, giving him plenty of videos to watch about science and religion, along with secular groups whom we have a lovely community with. However, last night, something really struck me.

He was brought up in a heavy Pentecostalism family. At the moment, they don't know about his change of belief. He isn't worried about what is going to happen when they find out; he is still suffering through what happened to him as a kid.

His brother and him were not allowed to see their mother, and were taken out of school for several years, being kept away from all forms of technology (TV, computers...) and were only taught from the bible. They learnt to read by reciting and copying bible verses. They had the bible literally beaten into them (bruises and all).

I know I can't help his brother (he clearly needs help as well), but I guess I was wondering if anyone had any help groups they knew of in Australia that could help formerly abused adults. Or even just some coping mechanisms. I notice that his change to atheism has been quite beneficial, and I have been pushing it, to allow him some deeper thought processes about what happened.

But last night, he went through a panic attack, remembering all that had happened to him. The sheer amount of abuse and isolation might have even given him PTSD... I'm really worried about him, and I guess as the only one he can really open up to about his past, I'm obligated to try and help as much as I can. 

So yes... any of your personal stories, hints, or web sites will be of immense help.

[Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/vn5l7/update_an_atheist_marrying_a_christian_can_it_work/) the previous post.

Thanks for reading if you make it through; sorry I couldn't make it shorter. 

I wish I could come back with some good news, to say it all worked out and we lived happily ever after, but I can't. I know, I know; get your ""I told you so's"" out of the way. We just broke up last night. My world is crushed, and I really don't know what to do with myself. I'll fill the details.

I took some of the advice from the great responses I received and we started discussing various topics in order to get a better understanding of each other's position. We started with the bible, and I realized very quickly that we weren't getting anywhere. I learned that when you start with the bible as the infallible truth, of course everything can be explained away, even if it doesn't make any sense. You can explain how Santa delivers presents around the world in one night... Noah's ark, giants, the rib story; I learned that she accepts the ALL of the word as literal truth. I tried to explain how I think some of it isn't possible with everything I knew and sources that I included, but it was no use. I've never met anyone like this before... and call me crazy for not realizing this sooner, but I honestly just assumed too much. 

I felt bad for making it seem like I was attacking her faith. By the sole fact that I denied God, she said I was attacking part of her as a person. I honestly don't mind that she believes in God, but when she was denying things like evolution, the age of the earth, the big bang concept etc... I felt the need to clear her misconceptions, of which she had many.

Me: ""God had to have some means of creating the world; how do you think he did it         scientifically?""

Her: ""I'm not ignorant to the world, I just don't think about how he went about doing it. I trust in the LORD and through Him and my faith is all I need."" 

This was the gist of her answers to a lot of my questions...

 I was as respectful as I could have been and explained things as carefully as possible using the help of some redditors, friends, and other credible sources I found out there. I even asked the right questions so she could think about things on her own.

I put A LOT of effort into this and included several sources of good evidence. We even went to the Chicago, Adler Planetarium which she found fascinating. I really think I did a good job explaining difficult concepts. But, in the end, and after a lot of emails pointing out her misconceptions and illogic, it didn't work. The last email I sent was clearing up her points about intelligent design and how and why we know they're discredited. She didn't seem to like this though since she kind of blew up on me over texting without much of a response. She must have felt conflicted and lashed out.

So, now we're over because she said God comes first in her life and by being with me she'd be making the sacrifice, with me not changing anything, by pushing him to the side. She wants a husband with that commonality. I'm struggling to see how a smart girl like her who respects evidence and science in pharmacy, bio chemistry and micro cellular biology, rejects evidence in science in other realms. It does not make ANY sense to me. 

Keep in mind, I respect this girl to no end and she's really is a great and fun person. This is the only major disagreement we've really had. I accept her faith into our relationship, but she can't accept me as a partner. I'm broken; I lost my best friend. This is so typical to say, but I can't help it. She's as crushed as I am and she even says ""it doesn't make sense."" None of my family or friends can believe it either. I can't emphasize enough how well we fit.

This is so unlike me to say, but f**k religion. I have such an immature hate for it right now, that it is the reason two beyond compatible people can't love. And my situation isn't even close to the horror it can cause. Such a tragedy.

**TL:DR** - My girlfriend and I split ways because I lack belief and she believes. Our discussions about the bible and science didn't mean anything. It's probably for the better, but I lost the most meaningful person in my life. I'm lost.

Reza Aslan seems to be another example of this from reading his AMA.  Not only are his views filled with things like alluding to ""god"" being an experience, but he also rejects a lot of supernatural religious claims like heaven and hell, etc.

My question is this: Spong considers himself a Christian, Aslan considers himself a Muslim.  Yet somehow, I (and plenty of other people in the comments of the AMA) struggle to accept this.  Speaking for myself, labels like Christian or Muslim should be reserved for something specific, and it should be possible for someone to incorrectly identify as a Christian or a Muslim.  So what's the correct course of action?  How do we decide what these terms mean?  When using these terms, is there an obligation on the speaker to aim for clarity over identification?  Or do I as a listener have an obligation to not associate anything with the terms?  If it's the latter, then what is the point of the terms?

Preface: I'm in a children's hospital with my son. He has Leukemia and we are back in here because of the side effects one of the chemo treatments caused. He's doing great btw.

While we are here the nurse asked us if have any religious preference. We said 'no religion'. She said the need to know was for chaplain preference. Chaplains visit the hospital to offer prayer and such for the people that want it. The fact that we have 'no religion' doesn't stop them from barging in. Now, usually they are very nice and appropriate and say something like ""If there's anything you need, or need someone to talk to or pray with we are here."" and I'm just fine with that offer. It allows me to kindly decline and wish them the best on their way. But, this last chaplain comes in and asks ""Can I offer you a prayer."" and lingers there after I awkwardly tell her  ""No, thank you, we are ok."" She then asks again and I feel very awkward telling her no and she finally leaves. Maybe she's inexperienced but I don't know.

Besides that the last chaplain was a little rude (for lack of a better term) and frustrated me to the point of writing this, I find it to be in bad taste in general to be barging in to hospital rooms offering prayer to people who don't believe it, especially when their *child* is in a hospital bed next to them. I personally find it wildly offensive but I try my best to be kind to these people even though I want to say to them ""Pray to your god and ask him why he did this to my son and where is he now?"" 

So, what say you? I'm mainly just expressing some frustration here but have any of you had a similar experience? How did you handle it? What do you feel/think about chaplains in hospitals?

It's characterized as an Evangelical movement that has an overtly theocratic agenda for the US. It wants to establish Chistian control over the ""Seven Mountains of Influence"" of ""business, government, media, arts and entertainment, education, the family and religion."" And Rick Perry, Michelle Bachman, and Sarah Palin have all been tied to people in this movement.


What I'm not sure of is whether secularists should really see Dominionism as a threat. People in this sub seem pretty well read and reasoned on such issues, better than me anyways. So to my main questions:


* Do you think that the idea of organized political Dominionism might mostly be conspiratorial thinking and fear mongering aimed at secularists?
* Are the connections drawn between the former Republican candidates and Dominionism very strong?
* Do you think such a movement could ever get real traction?
* Do you think it's that much different than what the Religious Right has always done in this country? Or do you think this is just a new label for old behavior?


My take: I have to admit when I hear stories about this stuff I get frightened. But I also start wondering about the questions above.

She could not comprehend the concept of common ancestors.  She believed God put all the creatures on Earth, and then let them ""evolve"" from that point on.  Dinosaurs and other extinct were a failed experiment that were killed off by the biblical flood.  The flood also explained how currently we can find seashells on mountaintops.  

I tried everything.  I explained (to the best of my ability) plate tectonics, natural selection, vestigial structures, structural similarities between organisms, endosymbiotic theory, carbon dating, and everything had an (infallible) explanation.  I resorted to the long term e. coli experiment.  I provided mountains of evidence, and still I couldn't ""prove evolution"".  It was just a theory.

I stated that scientists aren't capable of ""proving"" anything only disproving null hypotheses.  I then proceeded to differentiate between the definition of theory in scientific fields and the more general definition.  I mentioned how no study in 150+ years has been able to disprove evolution, and all it would take is one little contradictory piece of evidence to cause evolutionary theory to be false.  Of course she said I was wrong, and ""studies"" have disproven evolution already.  I challenged her to find one for me.  I couldn't provide the common ancestor for all organisms on Earth, so I was wrong.

I stated no theory is 100%, but every single piece of evidence we have amassed to this point in time indicates evolution occurs through natural selection.  Did not expect her to jump on the infinitesimal statement of mine, that evolutionary theory is not 100 percent.  

I wasn't trying to break her faith.  I just wanted to open her up to the possibility to accepting evolutionary theory.  I didn't want an argument.  I didn't want to be burdened with essentially arguing against her belief in god.  My pleas for objective thinking fell on deaf ears.

This all happened because I mentioned how significant it would be if the Curiosity Rover happened to find evidence for microbial life on Mars.  How cool it would be if life on Mars was based on the same DNA as organisms on Earth.  In that circumstance how cool it would if it was discovered life originated on Mars, and colonized Earth billions of years ago.  I didn't want to question her faith.  I didn't want to go down that road.

How dare I challenge god?  Stating that there is no evidence to support the biblical god, and it is written so vaguely it is open to interpreted as one chooses was blasphemy.  Of course I did not provide any evidence for evolutionary theory.  Nothing I said mattered.  I don't know what to do.

What am I supposed to do? I aspire to be an evolutionary biologist; I'm starting a M.S. in Biology this fall.  Has she thought that I've been wasting my time pursuing this the entire time we've been together?  

edit: How have others handled similar situations?  As I said before I'm lost; sorry for the rant.

1351893509.0,80,self.TrueAtheism,12jb5w,Atheism isn't limited to just religion. I struggle to subscribe to system of faith (explanation inside.) Looking to see if others have reached similar conclusions.,gtwy,112,32,139,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/12jb5w/atheism_isnt_limited_to_just_religion_i_struggle/,"I have been without faith for a couple years now. But lately, my disbelief in religion is leaking into the rest of my life. Here is the short list of non-religious faiths that are virtually identical to religion, lack any real substantial evidence and/or are taken on faith.

* Nationalism (patriotism)
* Economic Systems (i.e. capitalism)
* Political Parties (i.e. Republicans)
* ""True love""
* Professional Sports

In most cases, people's opinions on these are identical or similar to that of their parents. Their views are usually similar to everyone in the region around where they were born. They will usually continue to support these beliefs even when hard, contradictory evidence is provided to them. They can immediately find faults in all opposing beliefs, but lack any type of critical thinking when it comes to their own.

I am breaking this up into sections. If you don't want to read it all, just read the sections that you find to be interesting.


**Nationalism**  - I could list a thousands examples of this, but the exact moment that I started questioning my patriotism and nationalism was when I watched this 25 minute video of Hugo Chavez addressing the United Nations ([Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNlQpLPS0Ik), [Part  2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoNky4bHCqg), [Part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQ2zWvWrArM).) I watched the video just a few months ago, but I can distinctly remember how the US media reacted to this story. [Hugo Chavez calls bush the Devil](http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,214709,00.html) was the headline, [repeated ad infinitum](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/americas/09/20/chavez.un/index.html). In none of the articles do they articulate the points Chavez was trying to make and instead make him sound crazy. Add to the fact that he is portrayed to be Anti-America (""US on the way down"") in order to get readers to cling to their nationalism-religion and block out any chance that they would ever listen to a thing he has to say. You'll have to watch his speech in order to compare and contrast the difference.

**Economic Systems** - Face it, there are too many other factors inside of a nation to know if a particular economic system is the right system. Also, what if the perfect economic system doesn't even exist yet? This is a religion that many wars have and will be fought.

**Political Parties** - Here's a [great video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Skw-0jv9kts) showing how you can clearly see faults in opposing political parties, but never your own. Meanwhile, they are taking on faith that their political party is the correct choice. And [here's a video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07fTsF5BiSM) showing how believers will support a nonsensical idea when it sounds like it comes from their own party. I personally cannot subscribe to either side of this nonsense anymore.

**True love** - I have been living with my girlfriend for about a year and a half. I love her and trust her, but I do not have ""faith"" that there is some kind of end all love that can conquer everything. One day, if things do not work out, then we will go our separates ways. I was married once, now divorced, and it was the hardest thing I have ever had to go through. I literally spent years building up an imaginary idea of our relationship. It wasn't true. Friends and family tried to tell me, but I refused to see the light. I had **tremendous** faith and belief in that relationship that defied all evidence. I paid the price for it dearly. I'm not saying that the emotion of love is fake - it certainly is a real feeling. Just make sure not to turn your relationship into a religion.

**Professional Sports** - Living in Pittsburgh, almost everyone I talk to is obsessed with sports. When I tell people that I do not watch hockey or football, even when talking in the workplace, they look at me like there is a third arm growing out of my head. Predictably, individuals will treat me DIFFERENTLY after finding out that I do not follow sports. Either by ending the conversation or by not making future efforts to socialize. You should see the reactions when I don't know the names of famous sports players. I imagine in other cities it is not as bad, but here it is terrible. I get the worst reactions from women, who act like I am *less of a man* because they know more about sports than I do. When I use to be on Facebook, I even lost two REAL LIFE aquaintences for posting an article about how the [Pirates are the worst team in the history of north american professional sports](http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/pirates/a-look-at-the-pirates-20-years-of-futility-655651/) after they left comments about how I am an asshole for not supporting the home team.

**I'm sure there's more** - That's all the ones I can think of right now. I'm curious what similar faith based systems you've escaped from that are very similar to religion, but clearly not traditionally considered such. Were you able to break free of these faiths or do you continue to hold onto them because it is easier?

**Don't get too serious** - I am not trying to say that everyone who is in love or everyone who likes sports is wrapped up with delusion. I'm simply pointing out that each of these systems, as a whole, is incredibly religious.",,False,,t5_2soy6,1351893964.0,,,True,t3_12jb5w,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/12jb5w/atheism_isnt_limited_to_just_religion_i_struggle/,

1337717934.0,82,self.TrueAtheism,tzsex,Why I went to protest the asifa (gathering) of chassidic Jews at CitiField this past Sunday.,absolutkiss,92,10,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/tzsex/why_i_went_to_protest_the_asifa_gathering_of/,"Let me tell you a story. 
 

Once upon a time, I went to a chassidic elementary school. Talmud Torah Khal Adas Yereim, also called ""Vien"", located at 33 Union Road, in Spring Valley, NY. 

 
I had a rebbe in pre-1a that I remember quite clearly. His name was Rabbi Hertz. All the kids loved Rabbi Hertz. 
Well, not aalll the kids. I didn't like him. I didn't like Rabbi Hertz because he would come into class and make fun of my friend Zvi Hersh N.. Zvi Hersh was a bit chubby, and Rabbi Hertz would make fun of him and call him an ""elephant"". This grown man thought it was okay to make fun of a child in pre-1a. That always stuck with me. 
Another thing about Rabbi Hertz. 
I distinctly remember going over to his house for Shabbos with other kids in the class. He would invite his favorite students over for Shabbos. It was an honor for us little, impressionable kids to be invited over to the Rebbe's house for Shabbos. We spent a considerable part of the week learning from him. Anyway, where did we sleep when we went to Rabbi Hertz for Shabbos? We slept in bed with Rabbi Hertz. I don't know where his Rebbetzin was, but I distinctly remember sleeping in a bed with several other boys and the Rebbe. 
Now, I want to be very clear that I don't recall being molested in any way. 
I don't know about the other kids. I don't know if anything happened. I just know that I slept in a bed with the Rebbe and some of the other boys. I know that the Rebbe was very ""fatherly"" with us. We snuggled with him, and to me, I guess I thought it was what fathers and sons do.
 

One more thing about Rabbi Hertz. He was a violent animal who beat children in his class. So while I got my first Chumash, the book of Vayikra (Leviticus), other children were savagely beaten by this man. He never hurt me (that I can remember); I was a good kid.
 

I went to Vien for the first thirteen years of my life. Thirteen hellish, miserable years. I hated it. I knew I was a little kid that had no choice and I hated it. 
I got special treatment. My parents were divorced; my rabbis and the Menahel (principal) knew this. Every few weeks I'd get called into the Menahel's office. His name was Rabbi Rottenberg; the irony of his last name was not lost on me. He found different reasons to call me into his office; I was in there almost every day  towards the end of my time there.
 

We had a routine. I'd come in, sit down, stare nervously at the desk, books, papers, pens. Rabbi Rottenberg wouldn't start talking to me right away. He'd appear to be concerned with some papers, or a book. I'd sit there for a bit, squirming. Finally he'd address me. He'd ask me if there was a TV in my house. They strongly suspected the existence of a TV in my house. My parents were divorced-that alone made me a problem, and I also was quite the little ringleader of my class at that point. (Rabbi Rottenberg once walked into my classroom during recess to find me standing on the Rebbe's desk, playing air guitar, with a Flying V drawn on the markerboard behind me.) 
So every time, he'd ask me if there was a TV. Now my dad had a TV in his house, and my mom had a TV in her house, which I wasn't supposed to know about. She hid the existence of this thing from me, but I used to hear the high-pitched frequency whine late at night, so I knew about it. 
Anyway, he'd ask me about the tv, and it was a catch-22 situation. He clearly knew or suspected that there really was a tv, but both my parents denied it, and so I denied it. Catch-22, if I deny it, then I continue to be interrogated by this guy, sometimes daily. If I admit the existence of the TV, I'd be expelled immediately.
I have no idea how many times I sat in that forsaken office on that uncomfortable chair, filled with deep loathing for this man, hearing the sounds of my classmates running around outside, while this bastard just repeatedly asked me about a TV for an hour. He made my life a living hell, I lived in fear of him and in fear of being called to the office for another interrogation.
So I hated my time there. I tried to cut school, I played hooky constantly, I became a really good liar. Lie to the Rebbe, lie to the Menahel, lie to my mother, lie to my father; I even lied to my friends about my parents being divorced. None of my friends in Vien ever knew that my parents were divorced until I told them, shortly before I finished elementary school and went to live with my father in Brooklyn.
 

My Rebbeim always liked me. I was a good kid who charmed the adults into thinking I was a quiet, innocent kid. Not one Rebbe ever hit me, but I watched every single one of them beat the shit out of my classmates. Every single Rebbe I had, from pre-1a through 7th grade, beat classmates of mine. (I skipped 8th grade, the system was all messed up in that school.)
I had one classmate, Yitzchak R., who clearly had mental issues. Everyone knew it and could see it. He would sometimes break out into uncontrollable laughter during class. I watched him get slapped and beaten countless times. I remember him crawling away from our first grade Rebbe, w̶h̶o̶'̶s̶ ̶n̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶I̶ ̶c̶a̶n̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶r̶e̶c̶a̶l̶l̶ Rabbi Boim. I remember Yitzchak crawling away, while this monster followed and kicked him. A small, mentally-handicapped child was kicked on the floor by an adult while the rest of the class sat and watched in shocked silence.
 

This was accepted behavior in my school, as it is in all chasidic schools. Most of the Rebbes I had were completely unfit to be around children. They were violent, abusive animals, and one of them (Rabbi Hertz) was almost certainly molesting children. Many of them were Holocaust survivors, and because of their experiences, were totally unfit to be dealing with children. They were not trained professionals, they certainly didn't have any degrees in child psychology, and they dealt with difficult children with violence.
 

I rarely think of these stories today. I'm not bitter; this doesn't run my life. 
These memories came flooding back on Sunday when I went to protest against the ""internet asifa"". 
I went to protest because the leaders of the community ignore the pedophiles in their midst, they even go so far as to support and protect them, while ostracizing victims and families of victims. Shame on them. Their way of thinking is so wrong. They are forcing all religious Jews to take the internet out of their homes, or face having their children expelled and ostracized. How many children are going to be interrogated by their own Rabbi Rottenberg about whether or not there's a computer, smartphone, or internet in the house? 
 

So, for all you people that think us protestors are crazy, or that we have no right to protest, fuck off. That's right, there's no better way for me to tell you how I feel without swearing. 
Maybe you had a better experience that me, maybe you're just so warped in the head that you just don't get it. 
You want to say that I had a bad experience so therefore I'm a bitter, angry person? You're right, when I hear about pedophiles being protected, I DO GET ANGRY. I am furious! I am upset that you want to ban the internet in your community, you want to know why? The internet saved my life! It was a window to the outside, and at thirteen, I understood that immediately. I love the internet. I love being able to easily access any knowledge, opinion, image, video. I love being able to communicate so easily with all kinds of people. 
 

Guess what. The first time I saw porn wasn't on the internet. It was in Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, in Brooklyn. I wore a white shirt and black hat and another kid who looked just like me handed me some folded pages that he'd ripped out of a porn mag. 
I didn't learn about sex on the internet. I learnt about it in Vien, in sixth grade, when my best friends Chaim Yosi K. and Yanky W. told me what it was. (My reaction: ""You mean Rabbi Rottenberg does that? EW!"")
 

Don't block access to knowledge. It'll find its own way of getting to the masses. You might as well teach people how to use tools properly, instead of banning the tools. 
 

 
PS. I just want to say one thing. I am not a bitter, angry individual. I am happy in life. I am secure in my belief system. (I'm an Apatheist.) I am offended by people who say that I'm irreligious because of my childhood experiences, that I'm angry, and that this is how I deal with it. Yes, everyone is shaped by their life experiences, but I educated myself and have been on a journey of self-discovery and truth ever since I was self-aware. Don't denigrate my opinions because you can't wrap your head around the fact that someone can be irreligious and happy. Guess what. I identify culturally as a Jew; I celebrate Yomim Tovim (holidays), I often attend Friday night meals. It's possible to be this way and be happy. It's possible to get along with each other. #LOVE

I used to be a Christian, but even if I still believed in that, it wouldn't help. It would actually do the opposite since I would embrace being in heaven right now. Basically, I just don't see the point in going on with life. What's the point of living, really?

My life is totally meaningless. I am a tiny speck in a vast universe I can't begin to comprehend. Trillions of things lived before me, and trillions of things will live after I die, and none of them will have any real purpose. You can tell me to seek medical help. I could do that. I could talk to my doctor again and start taking my medication again. But what would that really help? All it would do is extend my life a few more years, and it will mean just as much as if I had never been born. 

You can talk to me about the great human experience, and how beautiful life is since the chances that I would have been born anyway are infinitesimally small, and how we're all stardust or whatever. But none of it matters. None of us matter. A big rock could hit the earth tomorrow, killing us all, and the universe would go on as if nothing had happened. There is no point to our existence other than what we give it, and what we give it will just fade away one day like everything else. 

It used to be the only reason I didn't kill myself was because it would devastate my family. I have better parents than I could ever hope for, and it would hurt them so much if I killed myself. But so what? They're just going to die one day and all of our memories with them. Their pain will mean nothing one day when the earth is destroyed. Ultimately, nothing at all matters. Why shouldn't I just join in on the big sleep? I wake up and want nothing more than to go back to bed. I would prefer a long sleep that I never wake up from to this life. I don't even have a bad life by any measure; there's just no point to it. As is commonly stated in more eloquent words, I didn't have any problems before I was born, and it'll be the same after I die.

So I'm coming to this great atheistic community of Reddit that has meant a lot to me in the short time I have read it. I have enjoyed and been enlightened by the discussions that take place here so I figure it's as good of a place as any to ask for some help. Can any of you give me a good, no-bullshit reason as to why I should not kill myself given how I view life? I'm sorry for causing Internet drama, but I don't know what to do anymore. Please delete this post if it is not appropriate here. I just don't see any reason to go on, and I thought if there was something I'm missing, this would be a good place to point me in the right direction.",,False,,t5_2soy6,False,,,True,t3_1ffghk,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1ffghk/whats_the_point_of_living/,

When I was growing up, I went to church every Sunday and I attended Sunday School. One Sunday I started thinking about the meaning of life and I just couldn't understand why we were here. So I asked my Sunday School teacher. I said, ""Why are we here, on earth? If God created us, what was the point? What did he want us to do?"" And she looked at me sort of blankly, shrugged, and said ""I'm not sure. Let me ask the other adults what they think and I will get back to you.""

A few minutes later, Sunday School was over and I went back into the main room with my parents. I sat down and drew pictures or played with legos (I was always very fidgety when they were having the sermons, I thought they were too boring) until it was time to leave. As I was getting up and everyone was shaking hands and talking, my Sunday School teacher approached me again. She knelt down to a height with me and she said, ""I think I have an answer to your question. We're here to serve Christ and live our lives through him. We're here to do what God tells us to do and be his faithful servants until it's time to go to heaven."" I looked up at her with a pretty dumbfounded look on my face and just said, ""Oh."" She hugged me and I went outside to the car with my parents.

Looking back on that day I can remember how disappointed I was with her answer. I remember asking my parents about it and they agreed with her and said she was right. That answer always left me feeling *so* empty, it didn't even feel like an answer at all. Even now, I feel that diminishing your entire existence to a servant of God is so... well, sad. 

Anyway, this is my first time posting here so I'm sorry if I posted this in the wrong subreddit - I just really wanted to get this off my chest and talk about it. What do you guys think?

I have heard many vague claims such as “Many atheists are against homosexuality/gay rights."" They are obviously out there, but I would disagree with the claim that there are MANY of them. Of course it is true that religion doesn't have a monopoly on homophobia, though most of the time those speaking out against homosexuality do so on religious grounds. What are the atheist/secular arguments against the subject? I've heard few statements by atheists about why they don’t support homosexuality/LGBT rights, but their claims can easily be refuted IMO:

**“Homosexuals cannot reproduce nor have/raise a child, therefore they should not be able to marry. Marriage has always been about a strong family unit”**

Not true. I’ll put the fact that people who don’t wish to have children can still marry and the fact that marriage is viewed differently by many individuals thus sweeping statements such as “Marriage is about a strong family unit.” are not true aside. 

Homosexual does not mean infertile. We can still reproduce via artificial insemination. Or adopt, obviously.

**“Marriage is and has always been a Christian institution, therefore religious principles should be the governing body behind it.**

The fact that something is/was is not a valid reason as to why it always should be. Not to mention that ancient societies predating Christianity such as [Rome and Greece](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_same-sex_unions performed homosexual marriages) (emperor Nero comes to mind) and the first laws against SSM and making it punishable by burning didn't appear until after Rome Christianized (shocker).

**“Homosexual couples are not fit as parents. Studies have shown children of heterosexual couples are significantly better off than those of homosexual couples.”**

This is one that is simply a lie. I have seen zero studies backing this claim that haven’t been flawed in their methods. The infamous [Regenerus](http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/10/30/1110591/regnerus-admits-gay-parenting/?mobile=nc) study comes to mind first. The study was flawed for MANY reasons but the main flaw would be that the homosexual sample of single parents, minimum wage earners, would be compared to the heterosexual sample consisting of married, high income couples. I have only seen studies showing that homosexual couples are [no more or less fit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_parenting) to raise children. Though if I were to some across a study showing that children of homosexual couples suffer more on average than heterosexual couples I would most likely claim that it would mostly likely be because of the way society treats them for having two parents of the same sex and NOT the fault of the parents.

**“Forcing churches to marry same sex couples infringes on religious freedom.”**

In the US any ways, in none of the states that have marriage equality are churches forced to perform same sex weddings. Churches are allowed to be as anti-same-sex, interracial, non-Christian marriage as they have always been. I will say that in places where churches are actually allowed to give out marriage licenses that they shouldn't be allowed to discriminate since they are now dealing with a government institution in my opinion, but when it comes to simple ceremonies they should be allowed to be as anti-gay marriage as they please.
To summarize, I believe it is very hard to find an atheist against homosexuality/gay rights, but how often do YOU come across them? To atheists against homosexuality/gay rights: What’s your reasoning behind your views? Of course feel free to refute my claims, or strengthen them. :)

What follows is a bit of backstory, but it's not terribly relevant to my question. Feel free to disregard and just address my question in the title.

note: I am not looking to defeat anyone in a religious debate, but I would like to be able to respond intelligently to common arguments.

I was having a discussion with a friend about politics, and how I've never heard a non-religious opposition to same-sex marriage that made any sense at all. In so doing, I casually mentioned to this friend that I wasn't Christian, who then casually brought it up in front of a *very* Christian ""friend"" we share.

This friend, now concerned for the well-being of my immortal soul, wants to take me to church. I've agreed on one condition; that a higher-up in the church attempts to convert me from atheism to Christianity. This is a discussion I've wanted to have for a long time, but I haven't had an opportunity to.

I will calmly explain that I don't believe in their religion, and that even if I give them the benefit of the ""doubt,"" I can't just believe what they believe, and belief is what Christianity is all about. How can I take the first step toward ""believing.""

I am obligated to give them a fair shot at converting me, though I'm just interested in the conversation in truth. And hey, who knows, maybe some god really will show me the way.

Anyway, I said all that to say this;

What are some of the more common arguments Christians use in a discussion like this? For example; a friend recently tried to say ""if all animals evolved from another animal, then what animal could a platypus have evolved from? It has too many different parts."" That's silly, of course, and even though I'm hardly an expert in evolution, I know enough about it to answer a question like that easily enough.

What I'm wondering about are the questions/objections that are often offered by religious people, and some simple responses to them.

**edit:** I'm only looking for respectful, intelligent, succinct (when possible) responses to common religious questions/objections. Even if they ask me the stupidest thing I've ever heard, I still want to try to be as respectful and courteous as possible.

I don't believe in the existence of any kind of god, but I do often wonder that if God did exist, what description would fit him best?  Of course, I can't prove any of this at all, but I consider it a fun 'thought experiment' of sorts.  So, here is what I've come up with.

I believe that if God did exist, he currently resides not in our universe, but on the other side of the big bang.  We have no evidence to suggest that God exists in our universe, so if God did exist on the other side of the big bang, this would explain said lack of evidence.

I believe that God lacks the sufficient power to intervene in our lives.  The most that he can do is merely observe our lives.  Furthermore, if it turned out that God could in fact intervene with our lives, either he intervenes in such trivial ways that we cannot detect such intervention, or he cares not to intervene at all (whether or not this alternative makes God 'evil', I don't have an answer to).

Following from the previous point, I believe that God did not create our universe with a plan in mind.  Rather, he simply knew of the conditions necessary for a universe to sustain life at some point, created our universe, and now just watches to see what happens next.

Finally, I believe that God, like us, has his own moral code, however I doubt very much that he cares about our own moral code.  He will not act in such a way to 'correct' our moral code to conform with his, nor will he judge us after death based on our moral codes (or judge us after death at all, for any reason).

To reiterate, I don't believe in the existence of any God of any sort, including the God I just described; I just find it interesting to think about from time to time.

And I also think it's an interesting dynamic. I had to push to be allowed to go to church, and had to hide my Bible classes, in a country where most people are Christian by default.

So, do you have any religious children? How did you react when it happened? Did you see it coming when they were younger or was it a surprise?

If you don't have religious children, is that something you worry about happening? Is there a big religious influence in your area that you try to counterbalance?

**Edit:** I was really curious in you guys' perspectives and didn't quite expect all the curiosity in the other direction. So here's the short version for all those interested, and I'll try to answer specific questions in comments. Maybe ask a few of my own, but you guys were on it so far as descriptions go. :P

Raised atheist by an atheist and a lapsed Catholic ""cultural christian"". She says she is Christian, but we never celebrate any holidays that aren't secular, never went to church, it was taboo to talk about it with her around, and she would openly mock people who believed that Jesus was really God and not just some guy. She expressed just as much concern over my mental well-being when I converted as my father did, so I'm really not sure why she wears the label.

Have never been properly atheist, despite best efforts, and have instead always settled in deism at the very least. I've always believed there was something there, no one had to convince me of that.

Converted to Catholicism in high school, changed nothing about my life. Recommitted to Protestantism a year or two after graduating, changed everything about my life.

I fully admit that my personal experiences are not enough to convince other people, but I consider them enough to reasonably convince me. I will own up to the possibility of Christianity being a ""religion of convenience"", and at first that's basically what it was. The Catholic church was the one physically nearest to me. Over time, however, I've come to be convinced that the resurrection is fact, and that Christ is God, and that's where I presently sit.

I'm married to a Christian man, who was there throughout this. Met him when I was fourteen. For much of my life till now I considered him an extremist (he was actually a standard issue non denominational ""buy our t'shirt"" 30-hour-famine Christian). He has influenced the development of my faith, but he is not the one who suggested Christianity to me, and he is the one who's challenged me the most. At one point when talking about it I told him that I wasn't sure how much of what they were saying was true, and he told me that until I did I really had no business converting, and that every question should be answered before I proceeded.

On one hand, we're removing somebody from society that did something so terrible he/she should not be released. At the same time, we're saving the cost of keeping that person in prison for 70 years (debatable). 

On the other hand, I think death is the end. There is no afterlife, just blackness. By killing this person, we're stripping the only existence they will ever have. I feel some religious people can feel better about the process, because they ""know"" there is an afterlife, that this isn't our only chance to exist.

~

I, for one, support the death penalty. But, I think it should only be used for the most heinous crimes, and in situations where there is no doubt of guilt. (An example being the Aurora shooter) 

There have been a few people put to death, then later proven innocent, and I wonder if those deaths warrant an end to the death penalty, or if the regulations should be stricter.

Under the assumption that death is the end, and there is no afterlife (feel free to explain according to your beliefs on death):

How do you guys feel about the death penalty?

Are there any situations/exceptions that dictate who should/shouldn't receive the death penalty?

I realize that atheism does not constitute a set of morals, but it definitely changes perspective on some things.

As a bonus question: How should various mental illnesses affect the death penalty?

A few months ago I felt really sure i was an atheist, then I started talking to my father and he had just a few things I couldn't really answer. Biggest among these is, if there is no God, how did the universe begin? And yes, the answer is the Big Bang, but just go a step further--where did that come from? And he's said that there are many properties of the universe which, if changed even a minuscule amount, would make it impossible for planets and life to form (one example is the gravitational constant, I believe Planck's constant too, and some others. I forget the details, it was a few months ago, as i said.) the only answer I had to this is the theory of multiple universes, but there's no more evidence for that than there is for God, as far as I know (actually, there's probably less). So how do you guys answer this?

Edit: thanks for all the great responses! I just wanted to add 2 things, based on what you guys have been saying:

1) I watched the Laurence Krause video on A Universe from Nothing. That was really good, and thanks to everyone who suggested it to me!

2) the argument that God would have to have a beginning or a creator as well is actually answered pretty easily. God is, very simply, supernatural. He doesn't need to follow the same laws as everything else. Also, the main argument I've heard about the universe needing an initial cause revolves around the fact that the universe did indeed have a beginning, with the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. The argument is that everything that begins has a cause. God is supposed to have been around forever (which isn't really that outlandish--just 100 years ago, scientists thought the universe had just been around forever). Since He had no beginning, and He exists outside of our physical universe and is not subject to its laws, He requires no cause.",,False,,t5_2soy6,1358073589.0,,,True,t3_16gda0,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/16gda0/how_did_the_universe_begin/,

My wife is... well... she's not religious but would identify as Christian (probably would use the word Baptist, lol) if pressed. She does not go to church and has never read the Bible, but for some reason thinks that is the correct ""path.""

I have not explicitly come out to her as an atheist, but she knows how I feel and we have ""conversations"" about it often which is to say that she tells me how disappointed she is in me for not believing, that she fears for my soul and she wishes I would read more appropriate books (I am currently reading 'The God Delusion') and go to church.

So, I am formulating a plan of attack to address this. I have never read the Bible cover to cover myself, though I am familiar with many passages in it as I was reared in a Christian home. I am going to propose to her that we read through the entire Bible, cover to cover as our ""New Year's Resolution."" What could be more ""appropriate"" reading than that in her eyes? I've always heard that reading the bible is the quickest way to atheism so, we shall put it to the test. I will let her choose the version, whichever one she feels is the most reliable text (my prediction is that she will choose the KJV, which ironically is the version that I've learned has the most errors in it) and we will read on average about 3 chapters a day throughout the year and should finish sometime around Christmas next year (assuming of course she sticks with it and does not become an atheist before then) if I've calculated correctly.

So, that's my plan. Everybody wins! Wish me luck!

UPDATE: I have proposed the activity to my wife and I already started reading (I'm half way through genesis) and she is getting to it ;). We had a couple of heated discussions regarding my atheism that were not too bad but certainly not pleasant. Right now, as we are sitting in bed, I on my iPhone, her on her computer...

We got into a discussion about religion, and as proof that supernatural events happened she told me that when she was younger she saw a sword floating in the middle air.  But nobody could move it.  And that the scientists were baffled and noone could explain it.  She could even remember where.

She had no reason to lie, and here was a direct eye witness account of something supernatural.

I googled for the place, found something similar, and showed it to her.  She confirmed that she had misremembered - it wasn't floating in the air, but was stuck in the rock.  Somehow that detaile had gotten switched around.

To me, that sort of mistake was just unimaginable.  But after thinking about, think about how many times you've misremembered the color of something.  For us, it's just not a big deal if a t-shirt was red or blue.  They are both equally likely, and neither stands out.

Likewise, she was brought up believing in the supernatural just as much as the natural.  The distinction between them just wasn't that strong as to stand out in her memory.

As another quick example - another friend from rural Africa worked on a farm.  Ever year they hired a spiritual man to come and dance around the trees, make religious marks on the bark, and give prayers.  And my friend saw that the trees grew more fruit.  The trees really did have more fruit, especially compared to those that the ritual wasn't performed to.  My friend later moved to the city, became educated, and found out that the reason was due to the [cutting of the bark](http://homeguides.sfgate.com/cut-score-bark-fruit-trees-increase-fruit-bearing-36150.html).  The rest of the ritual was useless.

But if he hadn't found that out, imagine what he'd be telling people - that praying and dancing around the trees really makes them grow more fruit.

This review is for: [The Good Book: A Humanist Bible (Hardcover)](http://www.amazon.com/The-Good-Book-Humanist-Bible/dp/0802717373/ref=reg_hu-rd_add_1_dp)

----------------------------------------------------

I bought this book with no expectations. I had read an article about it, as an atheist I liked the idea and wanted to support Grayling's work so I bought it. I really was pleasantly surprised.

This book is not a compilation of work. You will not open it up and find passages from various works called out by author. It is truly written in the style of the Bible - Grayling has taken the collected wisdom of hundreds of secular philosophers and melded it together in the flowery prose form typical of the Bible. There is no reference list at the back to tell you where anything came from, he has taken the ideas and the texts and melted them together.

The Good Book begins with Genesis, where you can see the ideas of Darwin laid out in an inspirational way. Reading through this I was really pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. I'm used to this language being peppered with things I don't believe in, and listening to it at weddings or funerals generally gives me a lump in my stomach. Here was the same kind of lofty language, but saying the things I believed! I didn't realize how much I would enjoy hearing Darwin's theory of evolution told as a beautiful story of how we began and the cycle of life.

As you make your way though the book, you can clearly see where he has incorporated Plato's dialogs, but without specific references. Characters are mentioned in the same way as the Bible, introduced without preamble, just snippets of conversation or story which attempt to showcase an idea. There are passages on grief and death as well.

If you are looking to learn the works of these philosophers in an intellectual way, this is not the book for you. This book is meant to absorb the ideas they upheld in a more spiritual feeling way. I wish this book had been published before I got married, I would have looked for a passage from it to read at my wedding. I could see reading it at a funeral, there really is something cathartic about having grief and death and moving on with life written in this way.

I feel in some ways as an Atheist this may have been what I was missing and didn't realize it. I didn't have anything to help me find a way to feel good about my place in nature's greater story, I just felt the absence of the belief in an afterlife. I also feel like this is a book I could read to my kids to help them figure out how to be a good person in a world which is not always good and in which you cannot rely on an all powerful being to save you from your problems. The language is flowery and poetic, but it's also much more accessible than say Kant's Metaphysics of Morals. I minored in philosophy in college, I'm by no means an expert, but I have read some of these works and they are by no means easy to absorb.

So, I think for what this book is trying to accomplish, what it says it is in the description, it is a great work. ",,False,,t5_2soy6,1350375106.0,,,True,t3_11k7ws,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/11k7ws/an_atheists_review_of_the_good_book_a_humanists/,

I was indoctrinated as a child into the religion, but quickly found the 'darker' parts of the bible during my time in Christian high school (2 kings 2:23-24, Mark 7:10, Deuteronomy 22:20-21, etc.). I learned the barbaric ways of the old testament, how the New Testament is set on the foundation on these verses, furthermore, you can not just excuse these verses in deciding which form of Christianity you want to believe in (as all believers pick and choose which Jewish laws to and not to adhere to). Thus, I stopped believing in god due to this and various other historical, scientific, and philosophical problems I had with the religion.

Although, I find the idea of Jesus very interesting. If Jesus was taken with a grain of salt in some instances, his teachings seem very humanistic. Forgiveness, love, kindness, humility, pacifism, and stewardship seem to embody the character as well as teachings of Jesus. He rejected the accepted materialistic, prejudiced, and hate-filled culture of the religion he himself belonged to. In this mindset, his teachings seem very similar to Buddhism, although they obviously differ in terms of spirituality. 

So my questions to you, /r/TrueAtheism , are these: Is it possible to take god out of Jesus' teachings and follow the basic humanistic principles he stood for? Or is it impossible, improbable, or immoral to do so? Why?

A short background: 

I am an atheist (raised Catholic) and my girlfriend of 2 and a half years is a non-denominational, ""born again"" Christian. My road to realizing I did not have a belief in a god was very gradual, but mostly happened within the past year or so. When we first started dating, I was asked by her parents about my beliefs, and I just said that I was confused because I really was. It's important to note that early on, my girlfriend mentioned that her dad prohibited marriage to someone outside of their religion. 

So, the open-minded me, who was crazy about this girl, tried going to their bible church several times, but each visit left me even more confused, alienated, and uncomfortable (the place is a freaking rock concert for Jesus!). I then decided to try and figure out what exactly I believed in which, ironically, led to my inevitable disbelief. 

Now, here I am on the outskirts of this extremely Christian family that I get along with so well. They really are great people that I love to be around. However, sitting through her cousin's wedding yesterday made me realize that a time will probably come where I'll have to tell them where I stand with their faith. I do intend to eventually marry her once she's done with school, but I don't want to get married ""for god"" or make a promise to ""him"" as the pastor kept pushing and pushing through the entire ceremony. I would want to get married for *her* and for *us* and not live in the shadow of a supernatural being. The whole family seemed proud of the wedding and her aunt justified giving away her daughter on the grounds that she ""couldn't ask for more from her daughter marrying a 'godly' man.""

I have a feeling that my girlfriend suspects my lack of belief since I stopped going to church whenever they'd ask (very liberating by the way), but I'm currently working on finding the right time to tell her. She is a very intelligent girl, but I have trouble talking to her about philosophical/existential issues, especially about the state of the universe, god, contradictions of the bible, etc. The last thing I want to do is push these things onto her as her family attempted to push Christianity onto me, but I'm slowly opening her mind here and there to different possibilities that I can tell she has been interested in. While I don't *think* she will look at me differently, her family's perception could be way different.

I guess my whole point in writing this is to ask if this is a relationship doomed for failure in the long run. I realize values and beliefs play a huge role in a relationship with a significant other, but we agree on so many things, hardly ever fight, and are best friends. 

So, are you married to Christian or know of anyone who is? Did you suck it up at the wedding while they preached about living and being married for god? Can it work? 

***tl;dr:*** i have a Christian girlfriend from a Christian family. I inevitably plan to marry her. Are atheist/christian marriages doomed for failure

""Christians are an oppressed minority""

""No they're not, 76% of Americans identify as Christians, end of story""

Now, I'm not American, I can't comment on my own personal experiences. I learn about the country through 2 avenues, officially exported entertainment such as music and television, and unofficial anecdotal evidence combined with news reports that I imagine are primarily for internal consumption. This causes a huge disconnect, I read a survey that suggests something along the lines of 40% of Americans believing in creationism and I call bullshit because if that number was so high we'd see at least one mainstream TV program where the characters are devout Christians, a version of House where the people pray before every operation, a clone of Glee where the main characters beat up the gay students to a laughtrack. Due to this discrepancy I come to 3 possible conclusions

1. Pop culture in the US is overwhelmingly secular and, for lack of a better word, liberal.

2. There is an entire underground Hollywood that produces Christian media that never makes it across the Atlantic, and it is proportional in size to regular Hollywood.

3. The number of people who fall under the Christian conservative umbrella is extremely inflated.

Now I know there are films for Christians, Christian rock and the like, but these are sub-cultures, they're not even close to being mainstream, so #2 doesn't seem to be the case. I'll be very surprised if in the foreseeable future there's an entertainer as big as Lady Gaga who sings about being ""born this way but changing through faith"" and publicly advocates small government, creationist education and traditional marriage, those kind of things currently seem like career suicide.

I can't comment on #3.

#1 seems to me to be the most likely explanation, I'm predicating it for this discussion. Hollywood is well-known for mis/underrepresenting blacks and hispanics to great public outrcy, it's not a stretch of the imagination to attribute that to Christians, even if they are ""the majority"".

So the question is

**1. Is this the case?** If a Christian claims to you that they're an oppressed minority and cites the fact that popular culture seems to be overwhelmingly against their entire value system, how do you respond? That they have plenty of representation in music, television and printed media? That Christians typically belong to poorer demographics and therefore this disconnect is due to the free market rather than deliberate oppression, and is therefore alright?

**2.If so, is this alright?** the knee-jerk reaction may be to say ""their entire ethos is wrong, they don't deserve large-scale entertainment that invariably will double as a soapbox for their beliefs as time goes by"" but is that really the case? A culture is largely defined by the entertainment it produces for its citizens, are the Christian demographics like any other entitled to a piece of the pie or is it laudable that they do not get it.

If he made science, then it's not unreasonable to believe He'd use science to, you know, make stuff. Science would be a rule book, the means to achieve the ends of His creation. God could have very well created the big bang and God could have built the Earth billions of years ago, not 6000. When we learn more about the world through science, we may very well also be learning how God has built His universe to run. Voila, no longer mutually exclusive.""

Now, as an atheist, I can appreciate an unruly colossal monolithic church with lethargic members. A society where such a religion slowly fades into pure formalism is a society that is ripe for secularization.

Explicit secular activism might not even be needed, as is the case with many European countries.

I would love some good discussion about this!

In the entirety of its' history religion has divided, subjugated and turned us against one another.  Yes, we do it to ourselves anyway - but that does not excuse the role of religion in what has happened.  In a perfect world, live and let live is the answer.  We certainly don't live in a world like that.  Religion and the religious are a global threat to everyone else.  Look at the burning/stoning of women in Afghanistan, the Saudi bill trying to make cursing god punishable by death, homosexuality being punishable by death in Uganda, and even the ban on gay marriage in the US.  Then there's the next wave of hate-mongering in the US government, echoed by many citizens, that will probably end up with an invasion of Iran.

I was raised Catholic, but I can't ever remember a point in my life where I actually believed god was real and the bible was true.  I probably realized this around 13 or so, but I just thought everyone secretly didn't believe - they all just went through the motions because it's just *what people do*.

Fast forward to today.  I have read up on christianity and islam primarily, and they disgust me.  The more I learn, the more opposed to religion as a whole I am.  Every single religion I've looked at in more than passing fashion is in some way discriminatory - usually in a misogynistic way.  Even buddhism, which I see touted on r/atheism as the pinnacle of religious tolerance, is misogynistic.

I try to keep abreast of worldwide news, and just about every single day there is some religiously fueled atrocity in there.  So, how do you take this all into account and still think that religion isn't that bad?  I understand you can't force someone to believe what you believe, but I truly don't understand the defense of religion I see so frequently.

I grew up in the very liberal SF Bay Area, and am currently attending a fairly progressive college. I've only ever met religious folks practicing their faith in a positive and humble manner.

I'm not trying to be preach, I simply wanted to see if this is an unusual form of atheism, and if there are any other religion-friendly atheists in this subreddit.

EDIT: I feel like people misunderstand my position. I don't think my views are better or more progressive than anti-theist ones. Anti-theism is completely understandable to me, it's simply not my personal philosophy.

Also, using the phrase ""christian-teachings"" was misleading, I simply have a secular philosophy inspired by one of my close friend's entirely positive, loosely interpreted christian views.

I'm an atheist- I am in no way religious.

I didn't write this to try and convince you that opposing religion was wrong, I just wanted to know if there were other atheists who felt as I did. It seems that there are many.

Have any of you ever attended an atheist or humanist funeral? (note: the entire funeral industry calls all funeral services devoid of religious subtext ""humanistic"" even if that isn't the proper term for the philosophy of the participants... it's not me messing up the terms, it's the way the industry phrases things so as not to freak out people who'd get totally freaked out by the word atheist. I hate it, but... whatever.) 

What quotes did you hear? what quotes/material do you think would work well in that context? Have you found any good atheist sources for grieving? Dissapointingly, most resources on grief are heavily religious if not specific to one religion. 

I always liked this quote from a Tale of Two Cities- 
""A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged. It was appointed that the book should shut with a spring, for ever and for ever, when I had read but a page. It was appointed that the water should be locked in an eternal frost, when the light was playing on its surface, and I stood in ignorance on the shore. My friend is dead, my neighbour is dead, my love, the darling of my soul, is dead; it is the inexorable consolidation and perpetuation of the secret that was always in that individuality, and which I shall carry in mine to my life's end. In any of the burial-places of this city through which I pass, is there a sleeper more inscrutable than its busy inhabitants are, in their innermost personality, to me, or than I am to them?""

I know quite a few religious people and, having been religious myself in the past, I can vouch that praise of a deity can make one genuinely happy, as well as it can be an enormous tool to aid people in their emotional problems and cope with the tragedies of life.

I see these people who take genuine joy and solace, as well as contribute to society in good ways in the name of their god, but I also see things like the attacks on the US Embassy that are backlash of anti-Mohammed films.  Then, I remember all of the awful things that religion has caused.  Whether it be the Jews' conquest of Canaan, the Crusades, and the current conflicts in the Middle East, whether they be US-centric or between the Israelis and the surrounding Islamic nations.  I sometimes find it extremely difficult to justify something that can be manipulated to cause such enormous amount of conflict, strife, and death.

Many of the major conflicts of today are rooted in some religion.  The most radical members of any particular sect go out of their way to preach bigotry and attempt to ruin the legitimate happiness of others because their god allows, and even promotes it.  I'm not an anti-theist, and I try very hard to be tolerant of people as long as they don't try to convert me, but I am often conflicted by the undertones of religion that causes people to be...well, evil.

But I'm trying to figure out what's more effective, and I'd like to know what you think. Which approach do you take:

1) Denigrate religion. Explain why religious beliefs are dumb and harmful, and we need to ditch them. I think this approach is easier as long as you stay on the offensive, ie by drilling the other side about talking snakes and the global flood. The problem is that it alienates moderate Christians who might support teaching evolution if you can work with them.

2) Try to reach across the aisle, and remind the moderates that the Bible and evolution do not necessarily have to conflict. I think this is more effective for short term policy goals like what's taught in the science classroom. But if we look forward to a day when religion becomes a peripheral idea rather than a mainstream one, I'm worried this approach might delay that long term goal.

What do you think?

**EDIT**: I used to be of the mind that the rational approach is better, but I'm having doubts. Here's why.

Over the past 30 years, American politics has shifted to the right. I think part of the reason is that liberals are appealing to reason and common sense, and trying to be the level-headed ones. Conservatives are being loud, rude, and appealing to emotion. They are willing to look a little crazy to get a few crazies elected, and the rational, cooperative liberals are trying to reach out to the crazies to make themselves look rational. The effect has been to make crazy conservative look normal, or at least socially acceptable.

I think the same thing may be happening with creationism, and I don't want to give any ground. I'm wondering if the rational approach is best, or if it's too weak, and could cause us to lose ground.

Also, I don't mean any offense to any rational conservative/libertarians out there.

What would you use as an alternative to the brain-god in a similar situation? When your brain itself cannot conjure positive alternatives. An out of body god creature could let you see the situation objectively. 

(Personal/positive thoughts could work, but for people who are sick alone or are dying alone, how do they ease their suffering? This question could be a more ~~psychological~~ philosophical question, but I wanted to see what trueatheism thinks first)

From reading all your thoughtful posts I can conclude:

1. Personal responsibility, is what it's all about. 

2. It takes courage to be Atheistic as the buck stops with oneself. 

3. Sometimes things are shitty and acceptance is all you can do (thank you craybatesedu for telling it like it is)

4. The god voice is just residual, it's always been me, but to acknowledge that it *is* me, takes strength. Knowing that there is nothing there, other than myself, but...

5. ..There's always other people, and other people are key in the Atheistic way of life. Humanism.

6. Find solace in the stars, knowing that they're our creators. Even if they're mindless and unconscious entities, we have to have the wonder from within and it's okay to be philosophical or pantheistic about it. 

7. Buddhism?

8. ""The brain is powerful and it's in constant conflict."" jmblock2. If I/we appreciate the majesty of our brains and master looking at our thoughts objectively then we shouldn't need an outer source of comfort. This is the philosophy that needs to spread. That we can be our own friend. 

9. "" As long as i can anything i can feel - then i'm alive and that's better than not being alive."" manwithnostomach. Which I suppose means to look objectively at your suffering. Out of body objectivity. Which I guess is what 'god' would usually be the substitute for.

I started not buying what they were selling about a year ago and I voiced that to my youth group leader. He was really accepting and I kept going to see my friends. After a couple months, I gave it another shot and even pondered the idea of becoming a leader. I was going through the process until this afternoon. He sensed that I was hiding something and I told him that it's not going to work out. We then debated in a peaceful manner about the existence of god. He didn't try to reconvert me. His type of mentoring is to place it in front of people and seeing if they like it, not shoving it in their face. We eventually had to stop because he had a meeting but we resolved it. I still consider him a great friend and we still plan on hanging out in some form, but I don't think he will mention the elephant in the room.

I can't go back there because they believe I'm still going to be a leader and only a couple of them knew I had an inkling of atheism before. It will definitely be awkward if I go back.

They are being taught some really messed up stuff. They are being told not to go college, and that marriage is all that really matters for women. My aunt believes that women should stay at home, period. They aren't being taught critical thinking at all, but they are incredibly smart.

I would like to buy them some books that encourage critical thinking/independent thinking, but they can't be books that would offend their parents. I was thinking of things like Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, Animal Farm, or perhaps Catch-22. I could also see maybe a more general book on philosophy to get them thinking a bit beyond what they have been told about other ways of thinking.

The two I want to buy the books for are 12-14 in age and are both female. They are avid readers, one has read the hobbit twice and I never see her without the book she is reading at the time. 

Any advice for other good books that teach critical thinking/independent thinking, but do it in a way that wouldn't offend christian values?

The discussion started while we were talking about PAS and Euthanasia.( I am doing a project for school on the subject and asked what side of the debate my father was on ) 

We discussed a lot of things about christianity, and i used a lot of arguments i have learned from this sub (amazing sub) and youtube and so on, and a lot of his replies were either ""i don't know"" or ""you cannot use logic to prove or disprove christianity"" 

I also couldn't use the full arguments i wanted to because he does not yet know I'm not christian and doesn't need to know that just yet. While both of his main responses are absurd, they arent my main point of focus about the discussion. 

At the end of the little debate (if you would like to call it that) we were discussing hell and why people want to follow god. I said that most christians, wether they admit it or not, follow christianity because of the threat of eternal damnation in hell. I don't think he completely understood what i was talking about, but he replied by first getting a handful of coins from our coin bucket and put them over my hands and said,"" do you want these coins?"" 

the rest of it looked something like this: 

me: sure, why not? 

him: All you have to do is ask

me: can i please have those coins 

Him: sure *drops the coins into my hand* did you deserve those coins? did you earn them? 

me: no 

him: same thing with god, we don't deserve his grace, but he gives it to us, why would i look back at what i missed when i can look ahead to where im going? 

me: because, no one wants to be tortured in the worst possible way for *ETERNITY* 

Him: im not concerned with hell when i am looking forward to the amazing things to come. i dont think everyday ""WHEW, damn, barely missed hell today, guess i was lucky"" 

that last part is what led me to believe he misunderstood what i was trying to say. I still think that somewhere in the back of his mind, wether he realizes it or not, he just doesn't want to be tortured for forever and ever. 

I guess what I'm asking is, how would you respond to this/what are your thoughts? Also, what do you think of the arguments both he and i used? i also said that the new testament christian view of hell probably came from ancient greek/roman mythology, being that jesus lived under roman rule and that the hebrews, the ""original"" god followers, never mentioned hell, but he didnt seem to think that this would have influenced the new testament perspective of hell. i didn't attempt to tell him why this thinking was flawed, because i realized at that point that i wasn't going to change his mind and that it was pointless

I've arrived at this conclusion, and nobody that I've spoken to has really been able to give me a solid rebuttal. I'm not trying to convert anyone, I just like to think, and my thoughts have come to a standstill without any opposing debate. 

Here it goes. Everything ever known is entirely based on our ability to perceive reality through one of our body's senses. Every sensory receptor responds to a specific energy stimulus, but we don't have receptors to perceive every type of energy that exists. (Take, for example, electromagnetism. The only way we're aware of electromagnetic energy is because we were able to observe it's effects, either directly or though tools that transformed them into an immediate sensory experience.) So, our understanding of reality is completely limited by the perceptive capacity of this meaty aggregation of molecules we call our bodies. Who knows what other forms of energy exist all around us without our awareness because we haven't yet developed the tools to transform them into a perceivable form? Nobody, that's who. Therein lies my issue with the denial of god. Maybe “god” is just another energy that's out there. Isn't that completely plausible? And, considering our somatic limitations, how can anyone possibly justify outright denial of its existence?

Best argument ever, right?? That's my conclusion, and that's where my thoughts get stuck. Counters?

I am a HS coach at a public school in southern California.  I recently found out that the head coach is a creationist.  This being my 2nd year working at this school, I was surprised to find this out only 2 weeks ago.

Since this time, I have been at a bit of a crossroads.  The coach has been telling the kids that ""the theory of evolution has never been proven"", as well as talking about scripture at times.  He believes in a strict interpretation of the bible.  Clearly he doesn't spend large chunks of time talking about this.  It's kind of like 5 minutes before the workout begins is an open forum.  Now trust me, I am well-armed to debate him, and he cannot win against me (as I've already proven to him last week).  However, you all know that creationists (especially at age 60) are not going to change their minds.  And I am ok with HIM deciding to believe in these things, and rejecting science.  I do not expect to change him.  It really bugs me that he has been telling the kids these things.  It also makes me wonder how long it's been going on.

My goal is to get him to stop talking about it all together, but this has gotten me thinking that maybe I could be doing some good in the meantime.  My coaching experience has always been about just the sport, but I would like to teach my kids about the science facts I am familiar with.  The problem is, I want to avoid the context of science vs. religion.  This school appears to be largely religious, so do you think this can be done?  Can I explain these things without getting in trouble?  I was a biology major in college, and I can explain evolution/big bang theory in plain language to the kids.

Also, I am sure I will get people saying I should have the other coach removed, and possibly recommend I contact the FFRF.  I would first like to resolve this myself, and kindly ask him to not indoctrinate the kids, since I'm pretty sure THAT is illegal at a public school.  Hopefully that works.  My question is really about if a coach that isn't certified to teach science can talk about it during practice.

All of these are presented as scientific theories, which any intelligent person will tell you such theories are sets of conclusions based on facts, observations, and evidence, right? This is the argument ""we"" use to defend evolution, gravity, and germ theories right? Many scientists have called many of these G.U.T.'s unscientific because they were based of pure math, predictions, speculations, etc... and lack any real hard testable proof. When I watch PBS or Science Channel specials about  the universe, I am literally in awe, but as a skeptic, I do have to hold myself back and make note that about half of what they are saying has not yet been tested (or can't be tested, eg. other universes) and therefore it is not science. So, I just wanted to know your opinions on these matters, as I am going through a kind of internal struggle over what I want to be right (String Theory, the Multiverse, etc...) and what has actually been proven.  

These are some of the wiki pages that I took into consideration:
[String Theory Criticisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Criticisms) &lt;- Even my favorite layman physicist  Lawrence Krauss disagrees.

[Quantum Gravity problems and other approaches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity#Points_of_tension) (and if you scroll down to ""other approaches"")

[Multiverse Criticisms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse#Criticism) (I personally love the multiverse, but that doesn't make it any more probable, and yes, there is no ""Multiverse Theory, but all of the support for it comes from ""theories"")

I do not want to call myself a skeptic, but then accept some of these theories that many books/tv programs have taught me are scientific truths without looking further into them. I by all means think that we will one day find the true scientific answer to many of these questions , but right now, I don't think we can be riding our high horse on promoting such theories, or even talking about them as if they were facts. Which brings me back to my original point: These are all ""theories"", yet these is close to no evidence for them. I understand that math is the number one support for these so-called theories, but I don't think any person I will in the future debate, except pure math as evidence. I know there are active experiments like the LHC among others, but I don't know if that evidence is in line with our justifications for evolution, which is MUCH more supported by empirical evidence than any of the leading modern-physics theories out there. So again, how do we justify calling these theories, theories, the same way we call evolution a theory, and back it up with the definition?

I only raise the issue after a certain incident during a recent biology class of mine. 

So I was in a recent biology lesson of mine (I live in England but attend the second largest college in the country, as such there are ALOT of Christians and Muslims*) and the subject of evolution came up. This of course threw up big debates in the class, in which myself and a few others tried to quell the opposition posed to by the theists. 

Many of these people are going on to University to do medical degrees or various degrees in the field of science, yet they refuse to accept this certain field of science. Quite honestly, it scared me, the reason is quite simple. These educated, well reasoned people simply refused to accept a theory of science, with so much evidence to back it. Yet would accept quite eagerly, the various theory's tied in with other branches of science. 

I think if we were to boil it down. My question doesn't seem so... Blunt. 

These people take the work of a 2000 year old book very seriously. Without any question as to whether it may be true or not. They still hold on to the text of this book even when science mounds evidence to the contrary. If we saw on the news today a man had been murdering squirrels because a 200 year old book had been telling him it would save the world, as well as thinking he may be mad. We would also think he wasn't very intelligent. 

So to my question, could we. OR should we be able to link theism with a lack of intelligence?


* There are of course people of other faiths, but Christianity and Muslims are the two predominant ones. 


Also I want to make it absolutely clear. I am not predisposed to any side of this question I would like to hear your thoughts on the matter.

* All Senses are off/inaccessible/not even recognizable?
* ""Insert your suggestion here""

Regarding the Afterlife, I believe the idea and concept should be scrapped upon it's mentioning:

I am assuming Atheists wouldn't believe in the existence of peculiar souls regarding the flaws in concept of how every human could have a soul and technically grow and make souls through childbirth (the complexity of what you'd even call life would characterize whether someone has a soul or not, at what point would a child have a fully developed ""soul"" in pregnancy) etc. as well as:

The flaws within the concept of a supernatural transfer of a soul to something else, assuming everyone would define a soul as consciousness (without acknowledging the physical brain's function of analyzing and rationalizing happiness, sadness and the sense of justice and injustice, and for myself the end result Nihilism (no stance one way or the other).

If there was an afterlife, that means we are defined to a very peculiar universe/setting of which is based on living, eating, a lifestyle, a cellular organism of some kind, what else would we be? Anything beyond that wouldn't even be 3rd dimensional IMO.

The whole act of spending time in philosophy thinking about this special moment in our lives having been influenced by our surroundings on Earth to think of where our ""souls"" would end and having them happen to be in a place where a soul/consciousness wouldn't even be able to recognize as e.g. heaven, hell, somewhere better/worse than we previously were in, well it wouldn't even be worth it to think about it if we couldn't even change that.
Our physical bodies and the concept of justice and evil (e.g. if my friend drinks this water s/he'll live but someone else might not have some, but my friend will die if they don't drink it, yet its still evil for the other person) wouldn't fit even into the concept of ""karma"" since justice and injustice is relative, therefore we can't change our position in the afterlife at all in any way to balance whatever your opinion of happiness etc. is.

**TL;DR** Afterlife/concept of soul is impossible, irrational and non-existent. The defining of the state of death is IMO a rational approach.

Her answer was ""I want to start going to church like Nana(Methodist) so I can be with God when I die."" My wife and I started discussing this decision with her and while my wife was with me up until the point where I started arguing against God as soon as I brought up the possibility that there was none she got argumentative.


This started our sometimes argument about whether or not there is a god. It came down to the point where my wife said that ""I believe there is a god because I dreamed about how [stepdaughter][son one] and [son two] would look before they were born."" I know that there is a good reasonable and  logical counter to this (backwards causation is what I tried) however I am still unable to get her to acknowledge  that there is no reason for ""God"". 

With my stepdaughter and my wife the arguments of: Pascals Wager, Epicurus view on evil, and Russell's teapot came up (along with the dream argument). I need help debating these points with my wife /r/TrueAtheism. My wife understands and can effectivly debate these points however still falls back to ""God"" because she wants to believe. This has never been a problem for me until My stepdaughter started wanting church and I considered [Son two(Son one died from SIDS)] how growing up being heavily exposed to god(I live in the southern United States) may bias his views.

Also some advice about how to deal with the stepdaughters sudden interest in church along with how to deal with my sons(2yo) possible questions would not be unwelcome.

So, my parents had no money at all, and I wanted a [tent](http://tesco.scene7.com/is/image/tesco/215-3170_PI_TPS1361009?wid=250&amp;hei=250&amp;$Detail$) as a gift from santa. They made a big effort to get me one, and by the time I was asleep, they put it in the living room...

I called my dad at work (penitentiary, christmas day) and said: ""I behaved so well this year, besides the tent, Santa even brought me a bike!"". My uncle saw my parents in such situation and decided to give me a bike. It was one of the happiest moments in my life.

This morning is the first time I'm visited them since he started at his new church. Also, it's the first time I'm visiting a church since I came out as an atheist earlier this year. I'm just here to support my parents in their profession, just as they would join me at any work-social events I may have. 

Needless to say, I feel a bit out of place, and I'm dreading people talking to me after the service. I've already decided it would be best to just not directly answer any questions about my beliefs, as it might look bad for the church's new pastor to have an atheist son, and I don't want to spark any drama for my parents. 

Have any of you visited church with your family? How'd it go? Any advice for me? I hate pretending to be a theist, but I also don't think it'd be great for my parents if people knew about my position on their imaginary friend. 

Self post, not a funny or angry meme, so I don't expect much action on this sub. But it'd be nice to hear from some of you. Especially other atheists with parents in ministry. 

EDIT: 1) The last paragraph was written when i intended to post this to r/atheism.  So if the ""not a funny or angry meme, so I don't expect much action on this sub"" part didn't make sense, that's why.  I changed to TrueAtheism after i wrote the paragraph, realizing this would be a better place to have a good discussion, but forgot to change the sub.

2) My parents already know i'm an atheist.  I don't have to pretend around them.  I don't shove it in their faces, either.  Usually when my dad and i discuss things and religion comes up, i'll say something along the lines of ""Okay, assuming someone believes in God, they might react thusly..."" I bring it to a theoretical conversation, because he knows i don't believe in God.  This way we can still discuss whatever we want to discuss.

3) So i rolled my eyes quite a bit during the service, but no one could see me so that was fine.  Lots of people introduced themselves to me afterwards, no problem.  There was one girl who came and sat next to me and tried to strike up a conversation.  She said she hadn't seen me around and i said that's because i live in another part of the state and i'm just visiting my parents for the weekend (which is true).  Somehow or other she started talking about how she only recently began coming back to church, and for a while she was a ""bad person... worse than unbelievers!""  At that comment, i HAD to take offense.  I didn't come right out and say I'm an atheist, but i did tell her that her remark about unbelievers was offensive to me.  That's about as far as it got.

How does this happen? I've tried to put myself in the mind of a ""re-converting atheist,"" and I just cannot fathom it. I used to be a christian, and once I had seen behind the curtain, there was no turning back. Religion collapses like a house of cards once you start to look at it from the outside without the influence of the church trying to keep the wool over your eyes. 

The re-converts almost always cite ""I feel it is true in my heart"" as their reasoning for turning back to religion. Even if you ""felt in your heart"" that God was real, if you learned *anything* about the true nature of Christianity while you were an atheist, you wouldn't be so quick to rush back to it.

So; how/why do former atheists actually end up going back to the church? The only thing I can think of is that they weren't a ""real"" atheist, but I know that this explanation already gets some mileage out of Christians that try to excuse de-converts (""Well, they must not have been a *true* christian..."") so I hesitate in pulling a similar fallacy, here... but I will anyway: were they an atheist because they had learned the truth about the origins and the historical claims of their religion, and decided that it just didn't add up? Or were they an atheist because they were ""rebelling"" against something, but still harbored connections to their beliefs within themselves?

I'm just trying to get a feel for it here, because it is boggling my mind. It's like deciding to be plugged back into the Matrix, except you bring the memory of a robot-enslaved humanity with you. That reality would always be nagging at the back of your mind...

quote 
Apatheism

In practical or pragmatic atheism, also known as apatheism, 

individuals live as if there are no gods and explain natural phenomena without resorting to the divine. 

The existence of gods is not rejected, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view /quote
Personally I had heard of Apatheism but with another definition. That one don't care about gods and not about atheism either. 

But the term Practical Atheism was new to me. seems they have given it its own entry too. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheism this link also list it as a viable position. 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_atheism

What are your views on this way to relate to the issue? 
Do you accept it? If there is some philosophical error 
then what could that be formally named? Or is it an okay position? 

Is apatheist a separate category or always an adjective to atheist? 
You are always an apatheistic theist or an apatheistic atheist? 
in same way that it is accepted there can be an agnostic theist 
and an agnostic atheists? 

Edit. Thanks indeed for the positive response. Apatheism is an odd thing 
among active atheists on forums but in practice most atheists in population are very passive 
and don't try to voice their atheism in every situation so it is maybe a term to care about?

* Doesn't try to shift the burden of proof
* Doesn't try to obfuscate his arguments to hide how bad they actually are
* Understands biology and Darwin's theory (including e.g. how more complex organs such as the eye has developed) and won't come with dumb strawmans attempting to refute it
* Doesn't commit logical fallacies as the rule instead of in some exceptional cases
* Uses logic instead of just rhetoric
* Won't arbitrarily dismiss evidence
* Doesn't try to prove deism and use this as proof for theism or worse yet something as specific as Christianity, not to talk about trying to prove a specific movement (e.g. Catholicism) within that religion
* Is skeptical about the Bible/Quran/etc. and wants independent sources confirming anything claimed in it

Lately, I feel like they've crossed the line into absurdity, and I'm just not sure how to deal with it all.

The discussion started when my grandpa recited the old phrase ""there are no atheists in foxholes"". He was in the army, and has been in combat situations in Vietnam (if I remember correctly). I responded by saying that there _are_ atheists in foxholes, and that some of them take offense to that phrase. I explained that they find it dismissive and back-handed. His response was to deny that these people exist. He would not budge from his view that everyone on the front lines prays to god. No matter how I approached the subject, from military atheist organizations to atheist combat veterans, he refused to even entertain the possibility that someone could think differently that he did. Eventually, he just up and left the conversation.

That wasn't the part that stung the most, however. My grandmother was still there, and we continued talking a little bit about the subject. Mostly, she defended my grandpa's views, saying that they are a result of his experiences. I did my best to explain that I wasn't doubting his experience or what he gained from them, only bringing up similar people who had different experiences. Eventually, I offered to show her the website for the military association of atheists, found here: http://militaryatheists.org/atheists-in-foxholes/. She became extremely offended at this suggestion, and said that she would not even look at the page because she finds them ""subversive... they are destroying our culture."" 

This caught me a little off guard, since I thought that she would be open to reading the stories of these servicemen. She had just finished saying how she was proud of the people in the military that would make that sacrifice. In her mind, there is somehow a divide between ""normal"" servicemen, and ""atheist"" servicemen. Just like my grandpa, she refuses to even acknowledge these people or learn the slightest bit about them. I was personally offended that she would say that about people like me, and I told her how I felt. Her response was basically to say ""I'm sorry that you feel that way, but it's my opinion"".

This is my first time dealing directly with this kind of bigotry. I find it unconscionable that someone would simply deny the existence of an entire group of people because it's _inconvenient_. In my grandparents' minds, I'm just as closed-minded as they are, and my views are equally as valid as theirs. Nothing I say will ever make them reconsider their position because they'll either shrug it off as ""I don't have enough life experience"" or ""I'm just stating my opinion"". In fact, I asked them whether coming back to them in 40 years with the same viewpoint will make any difference, and they said that it would still not matter. These are not particularly stupid people, in fact I consider them to be quite intelligent and well-learned, but they still are _proud_ of their cognitive dissonance. They are aware of how stubborn and closed-minded they are, and they think that's perfectly alright.

I just needed someplace to vent all of this. The rest of my family has opted to stay out of the conversation for the most part, so I'm getting no help from them. I know that you out there have similar stories about family or close friends, and I'd like to hear how you've dealt with the situation.

My grandparents are religious but my parents were never really into it. I've been atheist from about 8 or 9, when my grandparents influence became more peripheral and I spent more time reading about different world religions and thinking for myself. The fact that my family weren't church-goers or actively involved in religion in any way made it very easy for me to shrug off the Christian things my grandparents had taught me as just stories and metaphors.

Fast forward to now. I have three sisters who are much younger than me (aged 17, 14 and 13) who have recently (past year or two) become involved in the church. I have a huge problem with this. A lot of it is to do with my own experiences with extremely hypocritical, closed-minded Christians. But its also the fact that the 17 year old in particular is taking it extremely seriously. She found her way to religion after a dramatic breakup and was comforted by what she found. I can understand this, but now she's all ""I want to live my life for Jesus!"" and it kills me. She's young, this is the only life she gets, I want her to live it for her, not for some fictional pseudo-deity.

I've tried talking to her but she refuses to listen. She doesn't see any of the flaws in the religious ""logic"" she spouts or the hypocrisy of the bible. She's burying her head so deep in the sand I seriously worry that she'll never come out. The younger two I don't think are as serious about it, I feel like they're just following her lead, so I'm not as worried about them. I've tried talking to my mother, but her attitude is there are worse things she could be doing, so why bother worrying.

I'm wondering how I can try and make peace with this situation. I love them so much, I don't want to see them throwing away opportunities and experiences for such a ridiculous reason, but I also don't want to fight with them or push them away.

And it felt great.,Thorian1990,130,64,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/wlemt/today_i_blamed_god_and_it_felt_great/,"So today, I had a well and truly god awful day. It starts with my friend standing me up in town, which wasn't that bad. But then I get a call from home, saying a dog had somehow managed to get into my rabbit pen and kill one of my rabbits. It then starts to rain as I wait for my bus, which seeing as it's a Sunday and I live in England, means there are only two an hour.

So as I'm standing there in the pissing rain without an umbrella or hood I realise after half an hour that the bus won't turn up. What happens as I start walking, the bus trundles on by with me nowhere near a bus stop, so I have to continue on walking home. As I get the the bus stop where I would of got off if I had got the bus, another bus turns up. 

As I was standing there in the rain, I couldn't think of anything else to do, but blame god. And it felt brilliant, truly brilliant. The pure cathartic release of aggression of having someone *somewhere* to blame was a truly brilliant feeling.

I can kind of understand, the emotional crutch that theist obtain through having a god, and I can see how dependent people may become of it. The feeling a theist can have, that whenever something doesn't go their way that they have someone to blame must be truly a weight off their shoulders. Where as a ~~theist~~ **atheist** like me (once I'd calmed down) realised that there is no one to blame it is just simply a random series of events that just unfortunately pissed me off greatly.

But it has brought out an interesting trend in my liberal Christian Facebook friends. They are very upset by this situation. 

The vets I've discussed it with are pretty much down the middle of the issue. Some are pissed off and feel disrespected, and even posted this [picture](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc1/p480x480/998655_604049786293297_1182598051_n.jpg), which is a whole issue in and of itself. Others are completely fine with it. They say that his right to use the flag in whatever way he chooses is, just that, his right and is why they fought in the first place, to maintain his rights. 

My Christian friends are upset and crying for Lil Wayne's head, I've argued that the flag is merely a symbol. It represents the United States, but it *isn't* the United States. Just because someone desecrates the flag does not mean they are destroying the values it stands for (yes, I understand the view of the US being corrupt and evil, but look at it from the perspective of someone who appreciates, but is critical, of their country). Even if you burn a copy of the constitution, it doesn't destroy the ideas, just the hard copy. Of course, they would also be upset about the burning of bibles.

I have tried to tell them that just because *you* view an *item* as sacred does not give you the right to dictate that others hold it as such. They want everyone to be as reverent to the flag as they are, and yet these same people criticize and even laugh at, say, Muslims who riot about cartoon depictions of Mohammed. Why should everyone else respect their flag while these friends flagrantly disregard others' prophets. What makes their values more special than others'?
 
I have also tried to make parallels between the flag and graven images. The way they revere it borders on worship, and I use that word. I've compared it to a golden calf. Am I wrong in this parallel? Even when I was a kid and still attending church, I never understood the difference between saluting the flag and worshiping a false idol. Of course there is a difference if you are saluting *ideas*, but the fact that they are enraged by Lil Wayne stepping/trampling/jumping on an inanimate objects shows that they care *more* about bending his views to match their own than about the ideals the flag represents.

I love her unconditionally and want her to grow up to be a rational, thinking adult who realizes her full potential in life. My daughter is very intelligent and inquisitive, but her mother is not (putting it as politely as I can - I could rant for hours on that). The mother takes our daughter to some holy-roller church regularly, and I'm very afraid that they are going to indoctrinate her as much as they can and cause intellectual and/or emotional conflict for my child. I'm also afraid that if I reveal too much about my lack of belief and my utter disdain for religion to my daughter, that the mother could get vindictive and make it difficult for me to see my daughter or make my life miserable in other ways. Note that I live in Georgia, and her mother is in North Carolina. I'm moving there very soon. Regardless, neither state is very enlightened when it comes to domestic laws, and the courts tend to side with the mothers in matters related to child custody/visitation/support. And everyone here probably can guess how it is to live as an atheist in a Bible-belt state.

Anyway...I want to counteract the brainwashing as much as I can without causing major problems for myself or my child. Are there any other atheist parents who are separated/divorced/never married that have experience or advice in dealing with this kind of situation? Thanks in advance!

She goes to church every day and is at the point now where she puts all her faith and trust in a higher power. To the point where ""He"" makes all the decisions... I've left well enough alone because she seems happy and none of her life decisions were proving to be detrimental. Also, she's always been impulsive and attacked things at full throttle so I haven't bothered much with her new lifestyle choices because I figured she'd burn out soon. However, she has lost touch with all of her old friends (this includes me) and family. She doesn't have time for anyone except people at church. This is also made worse for me because I moved about 2,000 miles away from her when she got started with all of this church stuff.

She recently told me that she's met this guy, they've been dating for less than 2 months, and they want to get married. When I asked her what the rush was she said she felt that she cannot experience the ""full extent of the relationship"" without getting married first. I told her that it isn't wasn't a very good reason to commit yourself to life with someone you hardly know just so that you can have sex without feeling like you're ""living in sin."" She believes that if she puts enough faith in God that He will make the marriage work.

I feel awful because her extreme way of thinking give me the serious heebie jeebies. This is one of my best friends... I shouldn't feel creeped out by her. I'm an atheist but I generally do not hate on religion but this craziness is seriously making me resent it.

Just kind of feeling at a loss and wondering if anyone has dealt with a similar situation and/or if they'd have any advice to give.

Context:
Talking with a friend about faith and his proposition is that an atheist has to have faith too in that we cannot know 'x' to be true with 100% accuracy. I have called it 'reasoned faith' in the past. Some snippets of the FB conversation both comments mine:

""I define/group faith in two different types: blind faith (typically religious faith, but not always - basically faith without evidence or at least a search for evidence) and evidence based/reasoned faith. Evidenced based, being we cannot know all things, so we have to take the evidence we have to make a decision. The rest of it falls to 'reasoned faith' because we can't know for sure. I have looked at the evidence but I'm not, as you say, omnipotent, omniscient, and omni-present. So, I have to take it on reasoned faith that god does not exist (that's not a statement of fact, it's a personal opinion).

Maybe I'm using the term wrong...maybe there is a better word than reasoned faith. What word would you substitute for it? Is there a better term for what we do not yet know but have at least some evidence to believe is not so?""

From another post of mine:

""..........however, we're really talking about 2 different types of faith. The kind you define as per Hebrews is what Christians typically think of when they talk about faith. Generally speaking it is just as our good man the Apostle Paul defines it: belief without evidence - if you will allow me to paraphrase.

It's the level of supporting evidence [or lack thereof] we as non-believers are concerned with. The non-believers faith position could be called justified, reasonable or warranted faith - and yes, I have read the book. 

For example: I just parked my car outside the hotel. I have faith that my car is still there where I left it. I can't see it now but it was in park, I locked it and the keys are on the hotel dresser. Do I really know that it is there though? Not with 100% certainty. I have take it on faith, that my car is where I parked it. I come to that conclusion by examining my experience, memory and evidence that the car is still there. When you believe something with reason, you possess good grounds for supposing your faith in that belief is true. Of course, while I’m reasonably sure in my faith that the car is there, it’s possible that I’m mistaken. It is possible that someone has stolen my car. The point though is that, while it's possible, it’s very unlikely that it isn't where I left it.

Believers will argue that they do, in fact, have supporting evidence for their faith. I obviously don't agree (again, another long topic to discuss). I find it interesting to see the conundrum you (not you in particular) face when comparing Paul's definition of faith to those who try to justify God's existence via physical 'evidence'. It appears to be in opposition.""

(TL;DR - what word would you substitute for 'reasoned faith' for things which you cannot possibly know with 100% certainty yet have good evidence to believe are true/not true?)

I've tried to forget about it, explain it, or ignore it, but I can't and it just makes me so sad. I don't know what to do.  What's been making it worse is that I'm just now realizing that MANY of my Christian friends believe that.  I guess I didn't realize....

I am so depressed over this and I'd love to hear how other people handle it.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for all of your comments.  I'm in the process of reading them all and here there are just a couple things that I wanted to say.  

First, part of the reason that I'm so upset is that we've been best friends for 12 years and she just, in the past six months, became a Christian.  I understand that some people grow up thinking this way, because that's what they're taught and it's hard to shake, but with her, she recently and consciously chose to believe this, which is probably why I feel the most betrayed.  I'm not going to quit being her friend, but I don't...feel comfortable around her anymore, which is really hard for me. 

In general, with all my other religious friends the consensus seems to be either a) don't have Christian friends, which is sort of difficult, because I literally know two atheists in this whole town, plus that also cuts out a huge chunk of basically good people or b) just let it go because they either haven't honestly thought about the ramifications of their beliefs or they're probably sad that that's where I am going.  I'm really going to try to let it go.  Honestly just talking about this a little bit helps.

I identify myself as an atheist because, probably like most of you, any belief, whatever it is, seems redundant.

More accurately that is to say, anything anyone believes in when it has no effect on anything other than themselves is neither right nor wrong nor anything really...it's redundant. If you believe in god or an afterlife or that wearing a particular piece of clothing will give your sports team a better chance of winning, that is perfectly fine.

At the end of the day, even though what I essentially want is for people to think logically and rationally about the choices they make, despite their beliefs, this is still just my opinion.

My opinion, whilst I think it is right and good because at it's core it insists that everyone be allowed to have an opinion and to allow that they might be wrong about it, does not necessarily outweigh another persons opinion (even one that is completely the opposite).

Yet something deep down inside of me insists there is something wrong about that, and I want to know what other people think about this idea, because whilst your opinion might be good, maybe even right...

...it's still just your opinion!

TL;DR - Everyone has an opinion, and despite it been right or wrong, no one opinion outweighs another [ I do insist you read the whole thing though :) ]

I know Dawkins and Hitchens have entertained this question. I remember their answers but am still searching for the source video.

To explain the question further: Once you push the button - the influence religion has on the world at the moment disappears. All theists turn into atheists or agnostics. Of course religious buildings, works of art etc remain as part of our history - but everyone alive today simply becomes disinterested. None of the ex-religious people go on any crazy rampages after realizing there is no objective morality. You are not 'forcing' people to change their mind - the button simply makes it the case that people no longer care and give up faith. This may not make sense but it is a silly hypothetical question after all.

Follow up questions...

If yes or no - why?

If yes - would you consider yourself 'anti-theist'?

If yes - would you consider yourself a 'militant' or 'pro-active' atheist?

If no - do you hold any 'spiritual' assumptions or beliefs? (I imagine non-theistic ones since you're in this subreddit)

If no - would you say your personal experiences of religious people are mostly positive?

   I would say on the contrary that I actually have stronger values because I'm atheist, is it not stronger of me as a person to do something good for a person by my own personal convictions in opposition to doing something because I feel I have an obligation to do so in return for reward later? In Christianity good deeds are re-payed with good things happening to the said person, so a christian cannot do something good consciously without at least subconsciously thinking of reward in return. In this way doing an act of good is equal to an act of greed. Greed is not just the lust for currency itself but physical properties as well. Eternity in happiness is physical reimbursement for charitable actions, degrading it to the level of a simple business transaction.
   Whenever I do something that sacrifices my own time, effort, and/or resources I do so out of my love for my fellow human beings. Whenever I do something that harms another human being I feel bad about it not necessarily because I feel that I will later be punished by divine power but because I am saddened that I have seen a glimpse of myself as what I would consider a lower human being. Also on the subject of love I feel as though my love to another human being is stronger as well due to the fact that I believe that I myself choose to love someone not because it was a preordained event but because i genuinely wish to be as close as possible to that said person.

Many atheists have different problems with this argument, but let us put those aside and asume the argument is correct. What would happen if we take the agrument one step further?

First the argument;

&gt;(OA1) It’s possible that an all-surpassingly great being exists (i.e. a being greater than which nothing can be conceived). In other words, an all-surpassingly great being exists in some possible world.

&gt;(OA2) If an all-surpassingly great being exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world.

&gt;(OA3) If an all-surpassingly great being in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world (since the actual world is clearly a possible world).

&gt;(OA4) If an all-surpassingly great being exists in the actual world, then an all-surpassingly great being actually exists.

Though OA1 is actually a premise, not proven.

Now let's fill this in for Allah, we can think of Allah existing in some possible world...bla, bla.....so Allah exists in this world.

Now let's fill this in for the christian god (God), we can think of God existing in some possible world...bla, bla.....so God exists in this world.

So we have now proven both God and Allah exist in this world, yet both are by definition the one and only god (both are ""all-surpassingly""). **This is logically impossible.** And because:

1. we presumed the argument correct (use this argument after they use it, and ask them if the argument is flawless before you start)
2. the two ""one and only god""-part is pretty watertight

The only conclusion can be that the premise is proven wrong; an ""all-surpassingly great being"" cannot possibly exist in any ""some possible world""

1342509064.0,65,self.TrueAtheism,wovyc,Lifelong atheist here.  I'd like to share my story and discuss coming to terms with being called an atheist.,,73,8,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/wovyc/lifelong_atheist_here_id_like_to_share_my_story/,"I never believed in any deities, nor was I raised with any kind of religion.

Up until age 13, I just never gave any thought to it. There wasn't a name for what I was (or wasn't, as it were). I also didn't really give a lot of thought to what it was like for people in my life who did believe in god (although I had/have a lot of strong Catholics among my family). If it made them feel good, fine, but I never had more than an outside curiosity in religious tradition.

Then came eighth grade. I chose to switch to a Catholic school as the public school I was in before was an awful experience. Again, because I had no particular ill will toward religion at the time, this was just a chance to get into a school with a better environment and perhaps feed into my scholarly curiosity about religion. I also had a lot of friends at this school, so the choice was rather simple.

Overall, my experience during the following months was very positive. I had a great time with my friends, and theology classes were actually quite interesting. I learned the bible and a lot about Catholic traditions. The nuns were generally aware of my lack of faith, and in all honesty, none of them made me feel alienated or bad about the fact that I didn't subscribe. In fact, the nun in charge of my class once told me to ""be a good person and not worry about what god thinks about it"". In hindsight I imagine there may have been a hint of persuasion behind that kind of stuff, but it was never in-my-face or overly patronizing.

Though I'd heard the word atheist, and was familiar with the concept, I never identified as one as I felt the term unnecessarily divisive. Sure, I had no reason to believe in a god, but I also saw no reason to say I was anything because of my lack of belief. As Sam Harris once said, ""Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.""
This is a mentality I've always maintained, much like Harris also said, there's no need to title a ""non-astrologer"" or a ""non-alchemist"".

Unfortunately, people need their titles and grouping.

As time went on, word began spreading of my lack of faith. Most of the students really didn't care one way or the other (as most of them were pretty wishy-washy about religion anyway), but there were a few who couldn't quite grasp how one could disbelieve. That's when the word ""atheist"" became a four-letter word. It wasn't even that these kids were the most religious at school, they were just the most scared of the idea of a godless person in their presence. I never was met with violence (I was definitely comfortable with sticking up for myself), but what I was met with was avoidance and fear. People turned away from me as if I had the plague. As more students avoided me, others would follow. While my friends never turned their backs on me, it was obvious that I was not welcome among the student body. I left about halfway through the school year, vowing to never refer to myself as an ""atheist"". It felt like a scarlet letter. I never wanted to be identified because of something I wasn't (religious). That just bothered me more than anything.

Over the next couple years, I was able to shed the stigma around that title, and high school was a generally positive experience (as positive as HS gets, I suppose). Sure, I never really talked about my lack of religious belief, but I didn't really think it was much of a talking point anyway. It wasn't really until my mid-20s that I felt comfortable with referring to myself as an atheist, and even still I feel a bit silly having to justify a non-belief.

**So, friends in [/r/TrueAtheism](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/), how do you feel about being classified for non-belief?  Is it something you embrace as an identity?  Is it something you think shouldn't exist?  Do you have an entirely different philosophy?**

**TL;DR:** Was always an atheist, but never labeled as one until my teens. Turns out the label is what bothered me rather than the lack of a deity to make me feel warm and fuzzy.

I'm a Bible-believing Christian who doesn't find himself aligning with most of the denominations of Christianity.  In fact, most of them piss me off in some form or another.  I've been lurking /r/TrueAtheism for a while and find it quite informative to hear a completely different point of view on various matters of interest and it's really helped me understand your points-of-view.  Quite a few of the self-posts here regarding Atheists struggling with hatred towards Christians and/or their beliefs saddens me, not because of what you guys believe, but rather because Christianity has pushed its beliefs so hard and in very hypocritical ways and it's not fair to you guys or anyone else for that matter.

Most churches don't accept me because of my two main beliefs; Love God and love people.  The church, in America specifically, doesn't know what that means.  The church of America is very shallow and self-centered.  The church of America doesn't take time to follow the examples that we've been given, much less understand them.  We were told to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, care for the sick, and to make a difference in this world.  The church of American (I single out the church of America because I'm not very well versed with the actions of the church represented elsewhere), as a whole, hasn't done that.  We are more worried about picketing outside abortion clinics to shame those who enter their doors.  We are more worried about lining up in front of Chick-fil-a to ""show support"" and fill our gluttonous stomachs.  We are more worried about blaming people and condemning them to Hell because they exercise homosexuality and it breaks my heart.  We are so worried about legislating our beliefs and have completely forgotten to care for people and for that I say I'm sorry.

I'm sorry from the bottom of my heart that we have tried so hard to control everyone and mandate our beliefs.  I'm sorry that we have rejected humanity because of a difference in belief.  I'm sorry that we have forgotten what it means to serve people and have neglected basic human needs.  I'm sorry that we are more worried about passing out Bibles than we are about filling food pantries and taking care of needy families.  I'm sorry that we can't see past our own bigotry.  And I'm sorry that we are so arrogant and treat people like dogs.

Just wanting to see some other points of views. For a little background I would say that I'm formerly agnostic but consider became a Theisist in recent years. I believe in a god that loves everyone and wants us all to do good in the world.

What I want to ask is that why do some Atheists seem to think that Atheism is inherently a more rational position than Theism, all other things being equal. I'm particular disappointed by people who feel that Theism should be met by ridicule, as that makes them just as bad as religious people who ridicule atheists.

I take the position that the existence or non existence of a god can never be entirely proven regardless and is a matter of personal choice. For example if a god like being appeared tomorrow, one could still make the argument that it is just a incredibly powerful being and not a god.

Now I can appreciate Theism does not fare well under the scientific method, I would also submit that science is conducted that imperfect human beings influenced by their own pov and experiences, science continually improves itself and what we thought was ""correct"" and ""logical"" a hundred years ago has not necessarily held up to the test of time.

That being said I'm not here to try to change anyone's mind on what they do or don't believe. Just curious interested in hearing some points of view on why a lack of proof in god means such a strong regard for atheism. Conversely I choose to believe in god because it is the interpretation of my experiences that I believe could not have happened without god and I fully declare there is no scientific rationale for that.

Everyone babbles on about their values, everyone promotes values or decries the loss of certain values.

But I think this is the wrong way to look at things. Take, for example, the traditional family. From the literature I've studied, the traditional family was a solution our ancestors came up with because it allowed efficient use the limited resources available in a pre-industrial civilization.

Once the factors that shaped that environment are gone, the traditional family starts to go away. This is a straightforward consequence of basic economics.

Now come the family values nostalgics / defenders, who put their own spin on history: they imply that our ancestors followed ""family values"" and this is what led them to live in traditional families. And because they lived in traditional families, they succeeded.

This is the exact opposite of the economic interpretation. In the economic interpretation, a darwinian process is going on: those solutions which work are the ones that become popular. And only afterwards come the ideologues and philosophers, and formulate the solutions into meaningful statements.

So the whole idea of magical solutions that are applicable to every situation is just that, another case of magical thinking.

I thought of a little example to clarify just how different atheism is from religious belief.

Imagine a completely secular society where NO religions exist at all. You take a small sample of this society, say 10 people. Now these people have absolutely no belief at all; they don't even know what a religious belief is.

Let's say a man comes along in front of these 10 people and starts making supernatural claims involving divinities and other shenanigans that simply cannot be proved. He manages to convince 4 out of the 10 people.

Does the fact that 4 out of the 10 people in the group now identify themselves to a religious affiliation instantly make the remaining 6 religious also? I think not. **That's what being atheist is!!**

We don't *believe* in anything because there is simply **nothing** to believe in (God wise). The fact that those 4 folks now believe in something in NO way also makes us believers. We're just the same as before.

My parents believe that I'm a terrible person because of atheism, and anything that remotely mentions religion has my mother or father bring it up.

Both of my parents are really climbing to higher and higher extremes in these arguments, and I'm afraid I don't have much to say to them, often just walking away so that they eventually run out of things to scream about.

If God cannot create a being with free will who does not sin, God cannot be omniscient. If God is not omniscient, it cannot be said that God is omnipotent, for it could not be known if God's powers were truly unlimited. 

An omniscient God knows everything that will happen and sees all that will come. Such omniscience means that our paths are part of an absolutely deterministic reality and that our actions are not chosen freely but rather ultimately predetermined, and thus beyond our control. If God is omnipotent and omniscient and creates beings with free will who perform evil acts as part of God's plan, the terms 'free will' and 'evil' are meaningless and. Any person who acts in a way that is against God's law has no choice in the matter as they are acting in accordance with God's plan and cannot be considered to be evil as they are merely obeying God's will, thereby negating God's law.  

If the future isn't determinable and God's omniscience means only that God can predict exactly what will evidently happen immediately before it happens, God's plan is indeterminable and there can be no true prophecy but rather only an existence determined by the creatures with free will. In this case, if God is omniscient, omnipotent and completely benevolent, God can and would convince any being to not commit an act of evil before the person did. If God can but does not, God is not completely benevolent. If God would but cannot, God is either not omnipresent, omniscient or neither, but certainly is not omnipotent. If we do have free will, are responsible for our own actions and can deviate from God's plan, God's plan is not all inclusive and therefore flawed and God is by definition not omniscient.  

**If God's omniscience means that God knows all that will possibly happen, God's plan may then be one that has a contingency for all that will possibly happen. Such a plan would then allow for us to possess a 'free will', as we only really choose to do that which is possible. God's complete benevolence may then be the act of creating such an all-encompassing plan to assure us that we may seek salvation if we chose the right path, according to God's law. Such a state of omniscience also seems to allow for omnipotence, in that, while God chose to allow us to choose our own path, we could still never make a choice that was beyond God's comprehension or ability to counteract with damnation.** 

However, such omniscience proves to be problematic for claims of divine prophecy. Whereas such claims are said to predict certain, unalterable truths. Such a claim that a messiah would come may be referenced as nothing more than an inevitable consequence of God's direct intervention (itself contradictory to the 'unbreakable' laws of nature dictated by God), but to claim that such a messiah would indeed be killed is to say that such a fate is unavoidable. That is to say, such things as the death of Jesus were either beyond the control of those who were supposedly given the free will necessary to avoid such a destiny. 

To tackle this problem, one must claim that either the prophetic claim itself was actually a claim of probabilistic discourse or ultimate unavoidable discourse. 

If one chooses the path of probabilistic discourse, it then follows to say that such a prediction was just most likely to happen, and not destined. However, this method contradicts the nature of a prophecy. 

On the other hand, to claim ultimate unavoidable discourse would be to say that in all possible realities, a single outcome was definite. That is to say that the actions of each person who possessed the free will and was directly or indirectly involved in the prophecy would lead to the same result, regardless of the nature of the action. This claim, however, has obvious inherent contradictions as any outcome may be changed by sufficient alteration, and to say that any outcome is unavoidable is to then take the choice out of the hands of the person who possesses free will and to render the nature of such an existence deterministic.  

For example, that the second law of thermodynamics predicts that the universe will undergo what is known as 'heat death' is deterministic in nature, and so far beyond the control of humanity. If, however, humanity finds a way to avoid such a fate, the second law of thermodynamics and it's inferences about our universe must then be overturned. Thus, if God were to make a prophetic claim about the future that could be avoided, avoiding such a claim would prove God to not be omniscient, or at the very least that such a claim was not actually made by God.

1364392905.0,60,self.TrueAtheism,1b3yli,I've been told this is the place to come for actual discussion. Here's my thoughts on gay marriage (Warning: Long text post),frownifdown,85,25,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1b3yli/ive_been_told_this_is_the_place_to_come_for/,"Below is going to be an enormous wall of text that will only interest you if you desire to have a real discussion on same sex marriage or have some confusion as to the arguments for and against it. This is a very important discussion to have, just as it was important to have discussions on the arguments for and against marriages for a black and a white, segregation, slavery, etc. If you want to, feel free to read on, but be warned, it is very, very, very long. This is a topic that I am passionate about as I believe it has great moral ramifications.

**1. It violates the sanctity of marriage-**
We wouldn’t want to harm the sanctity of marriages such as that of Kris Humphries and Kim Kardashian, Brittney Spears and Jason Alexander, and the millions of legal marriages that have been performed in places such as Las Vegas. The ""sanctity of marriage"" that is exhibited in today's society is laughable. If you think two people who are in love getting married violates the sanctity of marriage, what do you think about the thousands and thousands of cases of infidelity that are constantly happening? The sanctity of marriage, if it exists, is determined by the two people who are participating in the marriage, and if your marriage is so devalued by another marriage then maybe you need to look in the mirror and face the fact that your marriage isn't very strong to begin with.

**2. Homosexuality is a choice-**
No, it is not. This is a scientific fact and is agreed upon by the majority of people not living in the south. If you honestly believe that homosexuality is a choice then it would logically follow that you make the choice to be straight on a daily basis, which would imply that you are choosing between two equal sexual urges, one for each sex, and maybe you are a little more confused than you'd care to admit. Answer this question for me: At what age did you choose to be attracted to the opposite sex? When you can answer that question then maybe we can have a discussion, but it probably will involve some questioning about your own tendencies, and not those of others. Furthermore, I am not going to let you get away with something to the effect of “love the sinner, hate the sin”, when this “sin” is nothing more than the person expressing who they are in a manner that is literally harmful to NO ONE except maybe your own insecure self.

**3. Gays can't procreate so they shouldn't get married/Gay adoption is child abuse-**
If you honestly believe that the only reason for marriage is procreation, then we are going to have to ban a lot more than just homosexuals. Let’s join together and stop any and all sterile and infertile people from getting married! If you can’t have kids, then you can’t get married! And if you make the choice as a married couple to not have children, your marriage is null and void and you are an abomination to the natural order! This is obviously a ridiculous argument for several reasons, the first being what I just discussed in how we would have to ban more than homosexuals from getting married as well. Secondly, why is it so important that we procreate? Are we really in danger of dying out as a species? Is this a growing concern for supporters of prop 8? Ironic, considering many (not all, obviously) of these same people are doing their best to keep contraception out of the hands of whoever they can. Procreation is obviously a vital part of society and even if we were completely comprised of homosexuals, there would still be procreation. Lesbian women can have sperm donors and on the other end there can be egg donors. This is not a real problem.
If you think that it is better for a child to grow up in an orphanage, bouncing around from foster family to foster family and possibly being abused in the process, live in a third world country, etc., than it is for him or her to be raised by two people of the same sex than your moral compass is so far off that I’m surprised you can find your way out of bed in the morning. 

**4. It is against the Bible and is an abomination to God-**
This is the basis for many peoples’ main argument and it is inherently flawed. Yes the bible speaks against homosexuality, but most of the mentions of it are in the Old Testament which is not used anywhere else in society. We do not stone adulterers, disrespectful children, or people who work on the Sabbath. These laws were all done away with by Jesus, who coincidentally, never mentions homosexuality. He tends to focus more on loving each other, which is the exact opposite of what you are doing. Yes, homosexuality is mentioned in the New Testament, but there is some doubt about the original word from which it was translated and it is also mentioned right next to sexual promiscuity, adultery, greed, and drunkenness, none of which are outlawed in today’s society.
Whatever your beliefs are on the afterlife, whether you believe in an eternal hell or just an eternal non-existence and exclusion from heaven, is that punishment not enough? If this is really the only life that these unlucky souls who are born into damnation have, then why must you ruin it for them? Let them enjoy their life while they can. Your judgment is not needed and God needs no help from you.

**5. It goes against what our country was founded upon-**
Contrary to what many people think, our country was not founded on Judeo-Christian values of any sort. The founding fathers did reference to a divine creator, but most of them were deists (someone who believes in a God that made the world and all life, but then stepped back and doesn’t intervene) and above all, secularists. The Treaty of Tripoli was written and signed in 1796 and says “As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion…” The pilgrims were running from England because the British were trying to force their religion on them, which is exactly what is happening now. Our country was founded on freedom FROM religion as much as it was founded on freedom OF religion. There is an important distinction that needs to be made. The great thing about America is that we should all (theoretically) be able to worship, love, and live as we see fit as long as it doesn’t directly harm (I said harm, not offend) other people.
It is also stated in our constitution that the government is not to provide any types of benefits to people and exclude other people based on race, gender, sex, etc. It directly violates the constitution to exclude people from these government-given benefits because they are the same sex.
We do not live in a theocracy and if there was a serious push from the Muslim community to force all women to cover themselves from head to toe completely when in public, it would be met with public outcry. Just because it happens to be YOUR personal view doesn’t make it any more valid.

**6. It violates the natural order-**
What natural order are we talking about? There are over a thousand species of animals that engage in homosexual acts. There is only one species that engages in homophobia and I’m sure you can guess which one that is. Even if it is some violation of nature (which it isn’t), why is that a bad thing? Let me list off some things for you: eyeglasses, air condition, gasoline, air travel, plastic, the internet, and homosexuality. Going by this logic, we can eliminate all of these “unnatural” things from society and expect a dramatic increase in morality and happiness.

**7. We are going to have two dudes that want to marry a refrigerator and their pet hamster!-**
Ah, the wonderful slippery slope. “If we let two dudes get married, then some guy is going to want to marry his dog!” In the words of Louis C.K., Good! Let him marry his dog! Why do you care, it doesn’t have any effect on your life! Seriously though, there is a difference between two legal adults getting married and a man/woman getting married to an animal or object that has absolutely no capability of signing a legal document, holds no legal standing, and cannot reason past basic instincts. This is a logical fallacy and it is ridiculous that it should even need to be refuted.

**8. Gay marriage will create a promotion of and an increase in gay children!-**
If a child’s sexuality is based upon their parents’ sexuality, then there are a lot of married men and women who have some ‘splainin to do as to why they raised a gay child. Again I say to you, if you believe that one’s sexuality is so easily affected, then you clearly have your own confusion and insecurities that you are dealing with and projecting those onto innocent people is a moral travesty.

**9. Children need to have a male and female role model in order to grow up properly!-**
Of course they do! That’s why after we keep the gays from getting married, we must all ban together to seize the children of all widowed women and men, and forbid single parents from ever raising children! We will put them into traditional families where they will experience the strong and manly presence of a father and the soft demeanor of a stay at home mom.
There have been millions of children that have grown up to be successful with only the presence of a mother, or only a father, or even only a big brother or sister. I am quite sure that there are strong benefits of growing up in a two parent household vs. a single parent, but I would also argue that there are going to be strong benefits of growing up in a two same-sex-parent household vs. a no parent household, which is the alternative being forced on many children who simply cannot be adopted because there are not enough wanting families for the insane amount of orphans out there.

**10. You want to see to guys making out on the street? Are you gay?-**
And the grand finale! This isn’t so much an argument against gay marriage as it is something I have had directed at me by ignorant and insecure men. I want to see two guys or two girls making out in the street as much as I wanted to see the morbidly obese couple I saw making out at the mall last week, which is and was none. Supporting gay marriage makes me gay in the same way that opposing slavery would make me black, supporting women’s rights would make me a woman, and supporting the lowering of minimum heights for roller coasters would make me short. I simply hate seeing injustice and opposing it does not mean that I am that which I defend.

In short, whatever your religious views are, please keep them to yourselves. We do not live in a theocracy and you wouldn’t like someone pushing their religious views on you and your family, so why must you do it to others? Look at what Jesus talked about when he was on earth and live your life based off of that. Focus on improving yourselves and stop blaming your misery on other peoples’ happiness. Grow up, suck it up, and realize that gay marriage is going to be legal before you know it, and the fabric of society will still be intact. Besides, why would gay people ruin fabric?!

I think about this from time to time. First the U.S. had to recognize that black people are in fact human beings (1860s). Then we had to recognize that women ought to have a voice in civic life (1920s). Then we had to recognize that *because* they're human beings, it wasn't right to treat black people as second class citizens (1960s). And then, unsurprisingly, women stood up to demand that they, too, not be treated as second class ('70s and '80s). The '90s through now has been about LBGTQ rights, and today's DOMA and Prop 8 decisions are yet another step on that path.

(And yes, I know that we're still fighting for full equality for people of color and women too. These things don't stop, but let's not split hairs.)

With every passing decade, American extends--however grudgingly--civil rights to more and more categories of people.

Which leads me to wonder who's left? Who is still not fully invited into the great American tent?

Maybe it's us. Maybe it's time atheists stood up en masse to demand we not be treated as second-class.

""Do you have a home church?"" (She may have asked ""Have you found..."", I can't recall.)

Me, thinking of a local group of skeptics and nontheists that get together often: ""No... but I do fellowship with like minded people.""

Her: ""Well if you're interested, we go to ------- ----Baptist Church, you can check it out at -------church.com!""

Me, smiling: ""Okay, thanks! Have a good one."" and she responds, ""Have a blessed one!""

There was more but that's basically the convo. I think she is less interesting now, but she still seems like a nice person with a great personality. I do my best not to let someone's religion cloud how I view them as a person before I get to know them.

That being said, I have no idea how to politely say I'm not interested or not a believer without pushing people away. No matter what scenario I think of, I feel like the other person will be offended at my declaration of non faith. I am uncomfortable and recognize that I shouldn't be, but this happens often where I currently live (Bible Belt, USA) and I find myself wishing people just kept their personal beliefs to themselves. I feel like if I were to respond with, ""Thank you for your invitation, but I am an atheist."" will make people turn and run (in fact, it has once already here when I was shopping at Target and approached by a stranger who was generally soliciting on behalf of her church!).

Do y'all have any suggestions as to how I can politely respond without shocking people or them thinking I'm some sort of Satan worshipper?

Until a few months ago.  Now I'm nothing.  I've started telling a few of my friends.  I'm not sure, but I think I'm starting to lose some of them.  One won't call me back.  I had to break up with my Christian girlfriend (it was mutual).  One good friend holds hope that I'm still a Christian at heart; I don't know what happens if/when that hope doesn't pan out.

Request:  Anyone have any advice for me?  Comments like ""if they don't accept you as you are, they aren't really your friend"" are nice, but they don't really help.  I can't afford to lose friends right now, imperfect as they may be.  What can I do?  Any stories of people in similar circumstances, and the wisdom they gained from it?

Edit:  I'm overwhelmed by the thoughtful, compassionate comments.  After reading through them, I've realized my deeper fear:  Maybe I deserve to be deserted.  Maybe in their eyes, I've washed out, given up the good fight, sacrificed my convictions and fallen for a lie (and who can say for sure that I haven't?).  What if this deconversion is/will change me into a worse person?  Even if I'm not worse, I'm different.  The old me was involved in religious activities (worship band, ministry leadership team, mentor, accountability partner, member of a religious fraternity, etc.), was an authority on God's word, an expert in the creation/evolution debate, would pray for you, would quote a Bible verse for you, and now that stuff is behind me.  I'm not fishing for pats on the back, and I know that everyone deserves friends, but maybe my friends actually do have a good case for leaving me in their past.  If I can't help them in their walks of faith, then I'm going to become a charity friend, and we can all have only so many charity friends.  If you can show me how this is wrong, please do.

I interjected with ""That's not how the burden of proof works.""  I went with all the typical rebuttals...

1.  Atheism is not a positive claim, it's the rejection of the validity of the postive claim of theism.
2.  I don't assert there is no God, I simply hold the position that there is no valid reason to believe that there is one.
3.  Teapots in space, Unicorns and Flying Spaghetti Monsters

They were pretty steadfast, saying things like

1.  Rejecting a positive claim about existence is necessarily a positive claim about non-existence.
2.  We should not expect to see physical evidence for God because God is not a physical being, flying teapots would require evidence.
3.  Being an atheist because of lack of evidence is an appeal to ignorance.

I have no formal education in philosphy or debating but am I correct in that number 1 is just completely wrong, 2 is special pleading, 3 is a misrepresentation of my position/strawman.  In the end I just ended the exchange because it felt like it wasn't going anywhere, I just have this terrible nagging feeling that he feels like ""he won, therefore he's right"" because I didn't get the last word in on him.

I've had people pass away in my lifetime and the only thing that really allowed me to move on was the idea that I will see them again- that this is not the end.

Thomas Paine's ""The Age of Reason"" has been one of my favorite reads of the year. If you have read it, what did you think of it? Would you also suggest it to others? Paine is a genius in the fact that he uses the bible as his only source, and uses its own text against it. He proves that most of the gospels could not have been written by who they were ascribed to because Matthew, Mark, John, and Luke would refer to towns and cities by names that were not changed until years after their respective deaths. Another sticking point for me was that these four men who apparently were all at the crucifixion, all had different ""tales"" for what happened that day. Like one claimed earthquakes occured, while others said it was fairly sunny, while another claimed horrendous thunderstorms. Then on top of that each one has their own unique account of what they did afterwards. I believe Mathhew claimed him and the twelve others went into hiding that night, while Mark said only him and Luke were together, and another source claimed something completely different.

Cultural traditions, even non-religious ones might suffer.

EDIT: The overwhelming majority of answers seem to say ""there are no cons."" here are a few other ideas:


/u/notcaptainkirk: I would imagine there would be a lot more depression secondary to social isolation.

/u/iamaXXL: What I would be curious about is charity. All of your church sponsored soup kitchens and pantries wouldn't exist, who would pick that up? You also have religious drives such as Operation Christmas Child, which is pretty cool, but that wouldn't exist either. If there is one thing about Christians I can admire, it is their willingness to open their checkbooks, as long as it means that they don't actually have to do anything.

/u/Volsunga: Lack of incentive to study the basics of the western literature tradition. I can imagine that the worst case scenario would be that people wouldn't get exposed to the Bible until college and thus wouldn't be able to understand most of the references in literature.

/u/Jazzspasm: No J.S. Bach, no Shakespeare, no Leonardo Da Vinci...
List goes on

/u/GroupDrink: I could see losing some great art. Not because non-religious subjects can't be inspiring, but because inspiration strikes everyone differently. The guy who would've been compelled to compose a great piece of music, or make a great movie, because he was inspired by a religious image or idea, may never have that inspiration replaced by something from reality.

Over the last two years I have slowly lost my testimony of God and Jesus Christ as a savior of mankind. I have embraced the fact that there is no God (as we know him) and that the LDS church and all other churches on the earth are false.

If I had realized this when I was 20, this would be a simple solution: Stop going to church and deal with family and friends' reactions accordingly. However, it is not that simple. I am 30 and am married with two kids. My wife is very much converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ. We pray with our kids. We go to church. We read scriptures every night.

I need some advice on how to break this to her. It's not as simple as just telling her. This cannot be solved quickly like a bandaid. If I don't do this right, I might lose my family. Pretending I'm still a believer is starting to take it's toll. For example, I've stopped paying tithing and now my wife wants to pay for months of missed tithing payments (10% of pay) which we absolutely cannot afford. My wife thinks that if we pay on faith, it will all work out. It's really coming to a head and I am going to have to break it to her very soon.

I'm also starting to feel really guilty pretending to be a believer because it involves bearing my testimony, which is a lie.

Is there anyone who has gone through something similar that can give me some real, genuine advice? Here are some ideas I've been considering:
- Bring up one issue at a time, starting with a lack of testimony of tithing. Then tell her I'm ""struggling"" with my testimony and go from there. The problem with this is I think she will be mad at me for not having ""faith"" in tithing and she'll want to solve it by forcing me to take a leap of faith and pay the tithing we cannot afford to pay.
- Maybe start asking questions to get her to have her own questions about the gospel. This could take too long.
- Bring it up first with the Bishop and then have a meeting with her and the bishop in a simple, non-confrontational setting

Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I'm really in need of some advice.

I am pleasantly surprised that this course is affirming my atheism, thanks to a scholarly pastor.",NanananaFAPMAN,69,14,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/1bpqbg/taking_religion_110_the_hebrew_bible_at_a_jesuit/,"Going into this class, I wasn't sure of what to think. I had already read the Old Testament many times, and knew of the atrocities within it. I assumed, especially when I learned my professor was a protestant pastor, that he would dismiss the awful things done by god in some excuse.

However, this has not been the case. Our class is nearing its end in May, and I must say that I have learned a ton about the Hebrew Bible in a very unbiased, scholarly way. He has taught my class the Mesopotamian influences on Genesis, and how the Enuma Elish is tied to the story of creation. He also dives into the literal exegetical meaning of each verse based upon the Hebrew (which he is fluent in) wording and context, even if it shows god as the bad guy. He has shown the scriptural inconsistencies in the Bible, declaring to us that the Bible evolves and changes its ethics and morals as it progresses. All of his claims are well supported by historical context and evidence, biblical exegesis, and he has written many scholarly papers on topics that have been put into encyclopedias and other such collections.

**In short, this guy knows his shit, and presents it in a scholarly manner.**

My professor has presented the information in the Bible as it is, as gruesome. He straight-forwardly points out the atrocious acts by YHWH, and does not excuse YHWH of this wrongdoing (such as the flood, Deuteronomy, 1 &amp; 2 Kings). He does not attempt to disarm god of the responsibility for each of his actions, both in the text and the real world.

**Instead, he claims god to be neither good nor evil, and not omnipotent.**

This is very interesting to me. How can a Christian believe in a god, and devote their life to a god, who, by his definition, can not be proven to exist or has been shown to stray from his own moral code.

Also he claims the miracles and visions described most likely never happened due to their close proximity to Egyptian and Babylonian myth, the many biblical sources which contradict each other and seem to be bias at points towards Israeli military superiority compared to historical writings from other countries at the time, human beings are not responsible for evil, the devil is under the leash of god therefore his responsibility, god created evil and imposes it upon others (Pharoah's hardened heart and many other stories), god has ridiculous arbitrary rules, and he is not all powerful since he attempts to solve problems and fails at times (such as attempting to kill Moses in Exodus or solving the problem of evil in the garden of eden). 

Many other Christians would claim god to be ""mysterious"" or that it is heretical to take these verses literally. However, according to an exegetical stance based in biblical scholarship, all of this holds to be true according to him and many other scholars.

*It astounds me that he is still a Christian!* His teachings have only confirmed my atheism. Many of the points he makes in class about the Hebrew Bible seem to be coming out of the mouth of Dawkins rather than himself. It baffles me, then, that he is still a pastor of a Presbyterian church.

I find it so interesting that someone can still follow all of this, after denying that god is all powerful or all good.

Just thought I would share, and see if you guys thought this was interesting as well. I can post some of my notes from class or the sources he presents when I have time also.

---------

I care about people.  All people.  I want everyone to be feel happy and fulfilled.  And the world, quite frankly, is pretty terrible for most of them.  War, famine, disease, poverty, crime, I'm sure I don't need to go on.  There's a ton of bad stuff, and lots that could be being done about it but isn't (and, thankfully, some things that are).  Now, while religion can be located in the chains of cause and effect that contributed to them, it's not fair to say that it's the 
*ultimate cause* behind any of these things.  These things are not, in and of themselves, why I'm against religion.  It especially wouldn't do to deny the efforts made towards fixing some of these problems that are made *in the name* of religion (and there are quite a few).  You can criticize the effectiveness of a *particular* effort, sure, but if you care about people, you should be happy about something that helps them regardless of the reasons why it's done.  

Religion is *not* the big problem.  The big problems are about how humans *are*; uncomfortable facts we've learned from studying our own psychology.  We identify with those who are similar to us, and distrust those who are different.  We judge other people for their behaviour, without bothering to think about the circumstances that might be explain that behaviour.  And when it comes to *knowledge*, when we're looking for ways to solve the problems we face, we're *awful*.  When we like an idea enough, we desire to *keep* it.  When the idea is challenged, we see this as hostile, something we must fight off at all costs.  Debate, rather than being about truth-seeking, becomes about *winning*.  We defend bad arguments made for our side and ignore good ones from the other side.  None of this is impossible to overcome, thankfully, but it's not an easy thing for humans to do.  And we need to do this in order to make progress.  To find new ideas that do a better job of explaining the world around us than the old ones, and to come up with new ideas for how we can make use of our knowledge.  And we desperately need these new ideas, or we'll never fix the world.

This still isn't quite why I'm against religion.  *Fundamentalist* religion, sure, religious ideas that say this kind of progress is *bad* and encourage followers to actively fight against it, because they already have all the answers and how dare anyone suggest otherwise.  But remember, resistance to new ideas is a problem that ultimately lies with *humans*, not fundamentalist religion.  Clinging to cherished ideas is what we do *by default*, and it takes deliberate effort to counteract the psychological biases that cause this.  In order for people to be able to do this on a wider scale, we need this concept of fighting against our own nature to be accepted on a *societal* level.  We need to fight psychology with psychology, make people less scared of changing their minds by knowing that the people around them think that ideas are only worth keeping if we don't have better ones.  Over the past century, we've managed to get the value of Science, as its own concept, to attain a level of approval, but not the actual *ideas* that make up this Science concept.  We need people to learn what it *means* to have evidence for or against an idea, and why the concept of evidence helps us distinguish true statements about reality from false ones.  We need people to be aware of [cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), so they can *notice* situations that might cause their reasoning to go astray.  And, most important, we need to promote the idea that arguing, when done for the purpose of truth-seeking rather than aggression, is *good*.  Idea-replacingly, paradigm-shiftingly, world-improvingly good.

And here is where religion becomes a problem.  To get more people to care about and thereby support scientific progress, to help us find better ideas faster, we need it to be a deeply held cultural mindset that ideas should be cheerfully subjected to all manner of poking and prodding, so that the ones that don't hold up can be replaced by new and better ones.  We can't make an exception, saying that religious ideas are exempt from this.  If we did, there would inevitably be important ideas that infringe upon things that a religion teaches.  People would wonder if it's *okay* to question the teachings, the result being that less overall effort would be put into examining these ideas.

I don't think religion can survive in anything close its current state in a society like this.  People care *very deeply* about their religious ideas, it *hurts* to have them challenged, and in this society they'd be getting challenged a *lot*.  And when I say it *hurts*, I'm not being metaphorical.  Religious people in this society would be under a lot of stress, which is a very real thing that impacts a person's health and happiness.  Yes, you could claim it's for their own good, that they'd ultimately be happier once they abandon their outdated beliefs, but this doesn't make the problem go away.  Not everyone could handle this.  There are people whose lives have been literally saved by religion, whose faith is the only thing that keeps them going, and who would lose their only grip on life.  People will die, and, while it wouldn't be fair to say that societal progress was the *ultimate cause* behind their deaths, you'd be able to locate societal progress in the chains of cause and effect that contributed to them.  I don't *like* this prospect.  Like I said at the start, I care about people.  All people.  If I were smarter, if I could come up with some idea that gives us the same benefits without also causing *this*, I would want that instead.

My desire to end religion isn't because I don't like religious people.  I don't even desire to end religion, so much as I just want something that's opposed to the existence of religion.  Because however tragic the consequences of making this change would be, it just *doesn't compare* to the continued consequences of not doing so.  Millions die every year to war, to famine, to disease, to poverty, to crime.  Each time we find a cure for a disease, each time we invent a technology that gives us more resources or helps us make better use of the resources we have, each time we refine or replace an economic model that helps us determine where our resources can help the most, that's a bunch of lives saved per year.  Multiply that by however many years sooner you make those discoveries thanks to having sped up progress.  Do the same math for each discovery that builds on the backs of those and happens sooner because they happened sooner.  I care about people, and this is the best idea I've got.

I'm gonna send him [""A Universe from Nothing"" Lawrence Krauss introduced by Richard Dawkins](www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaGktVQdNg&amp;gl=CA)

I grew up Catholic, but am now an atheist. In all the years since I ""left the faith"", my dad (both parents, really) has never wanted to have a conversation about it.  He's never been curious enough to ask ""why?"" or even if it's his opinion that something is *missing* or *wrong* with me, he's never thought to ask ""Is everything okay?"" or ""Can I help with something?""  I've welcomed the conversation- not because I want to debate, but because I think it'd be cool if my dad still wanted to talk, and get to know me... showing that interest still after 31 years. Anytime I've brought up topics of religion/faith, or science, and even literature and film- he doesn't seem too interested, and conversation always quickly sputters.

Last weekend, he went to some Catholic Congress retreat. When he got home, he gave me a CD with the audio of a lecture from the weekend. It was *New Evidence from Physics for an Intelligent Creator - Responding to the New Atheism* by Fr. Robert J. Spitzer, SJ, PhD

It seemed a bit rude of my dad to give this to me, after all the years and times I've made sure to be non-abrasive in trying to have any sort of serious/intimate conversation with him. Even when I asked him his opinion of the CD he gave me, he didn't want to talk about it. He basically just said to listen to the CD. If ever I brought up scientific news, or topics of debate that might challenge his views or beliefs- he shuts the conversation down, and won't look at any articles/videos I have for him to view. Now he hands me some bullshit sermon veiled in physics?

I want to find something perfect . . . an article, or video on youtube, that I can e-mail him and for the subject, I'll write ""Your turn.""

Care to help?

Tl, dr; I'm an atheist, My dad is a pompous, hypocritical deacon- what r/atheism or r/trueatheism gold would **YOU** show him (in response to a CD he gave me of a church sermon) if you could?

Anyways, I would like to give you the experience of morality as a theist vs. morality as an atheist, and I would like your input as well. I was a very avid follower of my church for just about all of my adolescent life until I reached a college age, and started reading and experiencing more scientific and philosophical aspects that would rule out theism. It wasn't until my second year of college that I finally decided that I was comfortable enough, and had enough evidence to accept the title of being an atheist. It was like a light switch had been turned in my brain. Before, I was skeptical and on the fence on many social issues, relying on the crutch of religion to hold my hand as I made my decisions. Now, I can accurately use logic, applied science and human decency to make these judgements. Morality as a whole changed as well. Before, I wasn't keen on being a completely moral person, due to the fact that I felt I was already ""saved"" and had a place in heaven. Now that I have wiped the slate clean, I have realized that morality is extremely humanistic in it's approaches. Now I go out of my way to help someone, or to be kind to someone not because God wants me to do it, but because I want to help and positively interact with other people. What are some ways that atheism has changed your perspective on morality? I'm genuinely interested.

I think this is the clearest **scientific** explanation for all the appearances of religious figures around the world.

Surely it's not a surprise to any atheist, but it's nonetheless interesting having a look at our brains work and knowing exactly what's going on.

On a side note, shortly after having seen this talk, I correctly suggested to a friend that his old and near blind mother wasn't suddenly going senile or demented, but experiencing the ""Charles Bonnet syndrome"".

I disagree with most of it, but I think it is kind of interesting as far as how atheists are viewed when criticizing Christianity vs. Islam. The article mentions something about how Sam Harris feels that Muslims should be profiled at airports, which I would be really surprised if he said.

And that got me thinking about the direction religion is going to take in the future. I've found it quite astonishing that a religion like Judaism is still alive after a few thousand years after its founding and they're are many religions like it that have stood the test of time. So what do you see for religion in the future? What do you think will happen to it in the next 10, 100, 1000 years or even further? I personally think organized religion is at a turning point in the information age were old archaic beliefs are irreconcilable with advances in science and most major organized religions need to adapt, for example drastically change or completely throw out old doctrines, or die. A good example, being a former Catholic, would be the Catholic church's stance on gay marriage is unsustainable with the growing acceptance of gay marriage and if they don't make a change they will suffer for it. For the future I hope the trend of no religious affiliation will continue but I'm not certain that religion will be completely phased out but only adapt and change as religion tends to be resilient. I think that maybe a more personal religion without doctrine like deism for those who hang on to the first cause argument will be much more popular in the future.
