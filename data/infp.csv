As an INFP, I typically remain passive in showing my anger or dissatisfaction at a certain subject. This can lead to displaced anger, or blowing up because of the smallest things. Being forced to remain around others can be entirely exhausting. I'm so tired of being looked down upon for being sensitive. I realize that it may be annoying to some, but if I can put up with your loud, garish personality, you can learn to deal with my sensitivity. I hate that it seems more socially acceptable to never show emotion, and I hate being made to feel stupid because I actually show how I feel. 

I hate that when I finally snap and make a rude comment, some of my friends look at me like I'm batshit insane. But if another friend said the exact same thing it would be ""OMG LOL They're so funny and unapologetic and sassy!""

Sometimes it's hard for me to decide whether I really am too sensitive or if I'm just surrounded by assholes. Probably a little bit of both. I just feel like society gives people the short end of the stick.

Finally I forced myself to just choose one because it was getting ridiculous. Then even after choosing one, I somehow ended up returning to Amazon to look at different options. 


I do this with pretty much any semi-big decision. I probably spent 4 or 5 months deciding where I wanted to study abroad. When I couldn't decide, I ended up choosing to do three different back-to-back programs over the course of a year instead of just one program in one location.

&gt; INFPs have this state of mind that I will call ""the mood."" This ""mood"" occurs when all of the negativity the INFP pushes back in their psyche comes creeping out to get them. In this state of mind the INFP will feel majorly depressed for any amount of time, varying from person to person. They will remember random negative emotions from decades ago and will feel them vividly. This is all a process where the mind is releasing negativity. It can last any amount of time (it's absolutely relative to the individual), and after that mood is over they will feel fine. 

This seems to be pretty relevant to INFPs; we get into ""the mood"" and have to retreat into our caves, away from everyone, where our introspectionist tendencies are at 100%. I find that even when I'm not in a horribly bad mood I still need to retreat to my cave sometimes. 

For me it's outside, in the woods. The trees create my cave and you can usually find me there walking/hiking through, in tune with the sights and sounds it offers. For me, it's a fantastic way to clear the mind and focus on what's causing distress, being aware of the thoughts and feelings without distraction so I can easily acknowledge and let them pass.

1369922605.0,55,self.infp,1fc4fi,Anyone else have some similar behaviors?,Melancholia89,64,9,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1fc4fi/anyone_else_have_some_similar_behaviors/,"This is some stuff I thought of that most people would consider ''weird'' (of course we know better)…Except maybe you fellow INFP’s. So I’m making this topic to see if you guys have similar behaviors. Obviously, feel free to share some of yours. By the way, english is my second language so I'm sorry if you find some grammar issues.

1. I will sometimes pretend I’m having a conversation with someone (either  a  fictional character or a real person) and imagine how it would go (I actually talk aloud in my head sometimes). 

2. Music can very easily affect my mood. Sometimes I can go from joyful to melancholic to excited within 10 minutes because of 3 different melodies.  If it’s happy music, I will actually sometimes just imagine being somewhere (forest, village, mountains..etc.) while the music plays and I may even hop around (yes, hop)  along with the music and my ideas.

3. On the subject of hopping around, I have a very big tendency to get out of my computer chair sometimes and just start daydreaming.  The more vivid the daydreaming, the more of an urge to move I get. Sometimes I aimlessly twirl around as if I was copying how my ideas are in my head (twirling around merrily). This is usually how I take mental ''breaks'' when I'm alone..They're not really breaks at all as I'm thinking more intensily during this (also I do this sometimes when I read something interesting that gives me creativity).

4.  The people I have the hardest time dealing with (I’m usually pretty laid-back and accept everyone as they come) are close-minded people who judge people every chance they get. The second thing would be people who never ask themselves why they do something or have 0 curiosity period. The third would be people with no sense of humor at all.

5. I made another topic about this, but rainy or cloudy days (or pretty much anything but hot summer days which make me  stay indoors if I can)  give me energy and, sometimes, will make me very melancholic (in a good guilty pleasure sort of way).  Hearing the sound of rain hit the window when I’m cuddled in my bed sheets is pretty much heaven for me.  I remember when I was driving home as kid with my parents I would stare at the raindrops on the car window all the time.  It would always calm me no matter what.

6.  I tend to put myself in other people’s shoes.  I try to understand their point of view by understanding their interpretation of the world. This obviously does not mean I agree with it, but I will seek to genuinely understand people. This is also why I like a story with very diverse characters. Like I’m witnessing a multitude of unique snowflakes (corny I know).

7.  This leads me to how I tend to meet new people. I like asking  questions about them instead of talking about me (or let them talk about themselves without necessarily asking questions). Sometimes it can go so far that I might give the impression I really like the person when in fact I’m just curious. This is why sometimes people are surprised I may remember details from a very old conversation because of how my questions were sincere ( so I remember more easily).
8. When I can’t go along with someone (not necessarily because I ‘’hate’’ the person, but rather because there is always perpetual conflict), I tend to just ignore them completely. I actually ignored my sister for about a year because she was impossible to communicate with and would always criticize my introverted side every chance she got, calling me a ‘’loser’’ or ‘’no-life’’ (she is an ESFP so you can imagine how her lifestyle is much different than mine...).

9. I tend to write too much if the subject interests me. Often. Like this list (I actually had to force myself to stop writing). I was only planning to write 3-4 brief points. And I’m too lazy to tl;dr everything. 
On the other hand, if the subject is boring to me (like it has happened many times in high school/college), I will have a hard time writing naturally and instead make my way though the essay by ‘’improvising’’ (for some reason I’m good at pretending I know more than I do about a subject and that I also, by extension, am interested in that very same subject).

I've never had anybody outright describe me this way, but I don't exactly hear myself described as ""warm, gentle, kind, caring, etc"" either.

**i. The MBTI Disclaimer**

[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ2QbS-EgrM) a nice starting platform.

MBTI is based off of a series of ‘cognitive functions’ which Carl Jung coined when he observed and categorized typical (general) human behavior. MBTI is merely but a manifestation of these functions. Counter-intuitively, MBTI does not actually indicate personality; it simply defines the basic, general parameters under which you operate—your disposition or temperament. It gives you clues as to the way in which you process reality. Your thought process—mental chain of command. In fact, true personality psychology is so much richer than MBTI that many psychologists and sociologists regard the system as utterly useless—astrological. I’ve had a few people tell me to stop ‘wasting my time’ with Myers-Briggs, as it ‘ultimately damaging to my understanding of the complexity of human personality’.

But I’m not one of those people; I think there is some merit to MBTI. My personal experience has proven that to be so. There is a lot of parallel between people. Many INFPs are indeed idealistic, living in their own dreamlike, creative world. Many INTJs are indeed more logic-oriented and highly introverted. But the reason type ‘descriptions’ of this sort work is because their framework is in the cognitive functions. It just so happens, for example, that Introverted Feeling (Fi—the dominant function in IxFPs) tends to evoke personality traits such as rich idealism, just as Extroverted Thinking (Te—the inferior function in IxFPs) tends to manifest itself as ‘bouncy’ thought patterns. But tendency does not equal absolution!

I strongly recommend against solely reading horoscope-like type descriptions to type yourself because of how incredibly general they are. Given, MBTI is general in the first place—human personality is much too complex to categorize people perfectly— but type descriptions are more often than not generalizations of these generalizations. Anyone can see themselves as potentially more than one personality type based only off of type descriptions. But similarly to MBTI itself, I’m not trying to be absolute here. An ESTJ will most likely find the typical INFP type description as not even remotely representative of himself, and vice versa. Sometimes type descriptions are actually very true.

My advice to those of you interested in MBTI is to take everything with many grains of salt. Be smart, and analytical. Myers-Briggs does not attempt to be absolute, so nor should you. MBTI merely attempts to put a general label on your behavior—suggesting where you might fall on a diverse spectrum of people. Realize that type descriptions never describe you perfectly, though you may think otherwise. Give yourself more credit. You are a unique individual and nobody else is like you. Don’t fall into the trap of trying to become what your type description says you are. 

However, do use the information embedded in the MBTI framework—the cognitive functions—as a guide to better understanding yourself. Do use type descriptions to put words to self-identified behaviors, assuming you find any. Do seek others of the same type and learn from them. Do seek others of all types to better understand generally how others operate and communicate. Do realize that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Do Use MBTI as a tool, not a define-all.

Anyway, as an active reader, take everything I’m about to say—and everything I’ve already said—with a grain of salt.

**ii. Common Misconceptions / FAQ**

Q: I keep getting different results every time I take the test. Why is this?

A: Firstly, a 100 question test is not likely to be all that accurate in one go. I myself have scored as either ENTP, ENFP, or INFP depending on which tests I’ve taken and at what times in my life. Secondly, most of the online tests are completely bogus and awful. Just look at some of the questions—does being prone to be late or always on time seem like a valid indicator of type preference? No, certainly not. My advice is to take the actual MBTI exam. Seek out the nearest career counseling center and take the real test. Thirdly, and most importantly, mood and other environmental factors play a big role in your type result. In a depressed or altered mood, the inferior function (see the function analysis below for more information) tends to surface more. An INFP might score as an INTP if he takes the MBTI test in a really shitty mood.

Q: I feel as if I’m two different personality types—a hybrid. I feel that I’m both INFP and INFJ. Is this possible?

A: No. If you look at the functions which define the INFP and the INFJ, you see very little similarity. The INFP and INFJ process things more or less in reverse. The INFP has Introverted Feeling, while the INFJ has Extroverted Feeling. Huge differences there. Look at the functions that drain you, or use up more energy. As an INFP, strong Extrovert Feelers like the ESFJ or ENFJ tend to drain me very quickly with their powerful Fe. I can only handle so much of their outward emotionality before getting really exhausted. In this respect, I cannot be both INFJ and INFP, because Fe is one of my ‘shadow’ functions, a function that does not come naturally to me, and one that drains me. Do some research on shadow functions, and you’ll come to better understand what I’m talking about.

Q: I’m either INTP or INFP. I feel that both describe me well. Which one is really me?

A: I think you’ve been spending too much time reading the horoscope type-descriptions. The MBTI framework does not allow for either/or. You are one type, and one type only. Just as you cannot be in-between, or a hybrid, you cannot be either/or. The differences between the INFP and INTP are huge. Look at the functions! An INFP has dominant Fi, while the INTP has inferior Fe. And guess what? You can’t have both Fi and Fe. You are only one personality type. Read about and master the Jungian functions, and you will come to understand what your natural preferences are—the functions you use, and in what order. 

Q: I’ve scored as INFP, but I don’t perceive myself as overly-emotional, or idealistic, and I find that no INFP type descriptions sum me up very well. Why is that?

A: Here’s what I’ve tried to cover in the disclaimer. MBTI is horribly general. You can be INFP and be a mathematician. You can be INFP and be an Olympic athlete. You can be INFP and be very outgoing and expressive. You can be whatever the hell you want to be. And you can certainly be entirely different from what your type description says. Humans are complex creatures. There is no perfect framework. Don’t be discouraged if none of the traditional type descriptions match you word for word. I assure you that you fit somewhere in MBTI, however remotely.

Q: I’m either extroverted or introverted. I can’t figure out which. Help!

A: Everyone is both introverted and extroverted. Everyone holds two functions that engage the internal world, and two functions that engage the external world. The difference between an ENFP and INFP is that the ENFP primarily processes reality with Ne, while the INFP primarily with Fi. More on extroversion/introversion below. Keep reading!

Q: You claim that type description pages are generally bad to focus on. But what about the functions? Aren’t descriptions of the functions just as general?

A: Well, yes. It takes an intuitive leap to be able to see the functions in both yourself and others. Once you develop a very basic understanding of what Te looks like, for example, you can start to actually see it in real life. You start to develop your own categorizations. It’s sometimes hard to describe the functions in theory because more often than not they’re more complex than basic terminology offers. But just like you didn’t know what a squirrel looked like until you actually saw one, you don’t really know what Te looks like until you actually can see and identify it. After you’ve reached that point, it becomes second-nature. Function descriptions don’t really do the functions much justice. The same goes for types. Once you identify one or two of them, you really start to see them all over the place.

Q: I think MBTI is bogus. Can you convince me otherwise?

A: In my experience, MBTI is a very useful tool to understanding the self and others. I’ve gotten to the point of being able to speed-read people and be able to quickly identify them as one of three or so personality types. This has helped me to better communicate and better ‘energize’ them—increasing the likelihood of a mutual attraction. I have a good idea of what an INTJ traditionally looks like, for example. I know how to basically communicate with them, to get on their ‘wavelength’ with ease. Trust me, this effect is real.

Q: You seem pretty arrogant. I think you’re stupid, and all your interpretations and applications of MBTI couldn’t be further from the truth. You should stop embarrassing yourself and go take up a new hobby, like fishing. 

A: Hey, I’m still learning about all this stuff, too! This guide is merely a regurgitation of all that I’ve come to understand about MBTI and typology—all that I have intuitively gathered in my studies. Sorry, I’m just trying to help! :)

**iii. Extroversion vs. Introversion**

Too often I see people comparing extroversion to outgoingness and introversion to shyness. This couldn’t be further from the truth. You can be a shy extrovert, or an outgoing introvert. There is so much overlap here. There are indeed shy introverts, just as there are outgoing extroverts, but the degree of social comfort is no indicator of extroversion or introversion.

Extroversion and introversion can best be thought of in terms of what energizes you. As we will see later, you are both introverted and extroverted, but due to the fact that you are most defined by your dominant function, you have a natural preference for either introversion or extroversion. As an INFP, think of what charges you. For me, thinking about the future—dreaming of what’s to come, perceiving a bright, colorful future—really empowers me. I could sit around all day (and have) just thinking about such things. I naturally gravitate toward internal concerns, and as such, I’m an introvert. An Ixxx.

I’ve noticed that when I’m forced to be the feature of attention, or when I’m in a situation where I have to express a lot of feeling vocally (in counseling situations and such), I get incredibly drained. I leave feeling exhausted. These sorts of situations don’t charge me up. I couldn’t sit around all day and talk about my feelings like an ESFJ might. That’s because such extroversion drains me. I’m more sensitive to the extroverted world; I don’t need as much of it as Exxx’s to feel at home—to feel whole. The inverse goes for Exxx’s. When forced to be alone and in their own head for long periods of time, they become excessively drained. They need that external action—they feed off it.

However, as we will see next, everyone has a combination of extroverted and introverted features. Nobody is a diehard introvert or extrovert. Everyone has a mix—a balance—of both.",,False,self,t5_2qn2o,1367800520.0,,,True,t3_1drdoh,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1drdoh/crash_course_in_mbti_and_the_infp_a_brief_guide/,moderator

I find it excruciatingly difficult to locate people who are like me (partially because I don't really go out and search), or think like me. People say I'm 'ahead of my time', in that I have an older mentality. I'm nearly 20, yet people perceive me as being at least 23-24 very regularly. Apparently I 'present myself as someone older'. I like this about myself, yet it is the cause of many concerns. For one, people in my age group generally annoy me to no end. The triviality of their conversations and interests is overwhelmingly disappointing. I'm not a typical college student. I don't care for partying &amp; promiscuity, 'breezing through school', playing team sports, or being a part of large social events. I want to sit down with one person every once in awhile, share stories and talk about genuinely interesting, more 'grandiose' things. Triviality is literally physically painful. It exhausts me.

I've posted about this before, many times actually. My desire to post this is probably a result of me forgetting to take my bipolar medication and being in somewhat of a slump.

Previous suggestions have been: clubs &amp; activities, group counseling sessions, music groups, etc.-- all of which I've given a chance. But people continue to disappoint me. I wish someone could just take hold of me, shake me violently and tell me to man the fuck up and put myself out there-- find people and stop being timid.

**Dominant: Introverted Feeling (Fi)**

""I know just how you feel--I've felt just the same way when that happened to me, and it really hurt. You should be able to say how you feel even if others don't always necessarily think it's appropriate--as long as it's truly from the heart. You should never go against what your personal moral compass says, even if that goes against the commonly accepted morality of all of your close family and friends and anyone you respect. I don't want to know what you should feel--I want to know what you do feel.""

The INFP's dominant Fi is an introverted judgment (Ji) function, meaning the top priority for INFPs is full, deep, robust, profound definition of precisely what values the user finds instrumental to the essence of his personal identity and that which he finds to be fundamentally ""good"" or ""bad"" at its root core. But it's more than just good or bad; on a grander scale, the INFP is concerned with the very essence of Good and Evil, Meaningful and Not Meaningful, Sacred and Not Sacred. This duality becomes central to the moral philosophy of many Fi dominant types.

Fi users believe there is a definite moral order to the universe (meaning that it is inescapably true that some things and some ideas are inherently more valuable, more virtuous, and more worthy of positive evaluation than others), and that the only way we may catch a glimpse of this sacred ideal is by allowing ourselves complete and total connection and understanding with our emotional responses and the way they reflect that which upholds the internal ""essence"" of moral goodness as we understand it subjectively and individually. One INFP friend calls it ""The uh oh feeling"" when his Fi (bolstered by Si) somehow ""senses"" almost immediately that a new person is up to no good.

For Fi, standardizing ethics collectively misses the point by blunting the individual's unique identity and influence so much that the real significance is lost.

Morality for Fi is not something that anyone else can tell you how to approach: it's something you just have to look inside and feel for yourself. Morality is too complex and nuanced, reasons Fi, to be marginalized by approaching it from a collective standpoint. It's too dependent upon the essence of the individual and his personal impressions, too subject to that individual's experiences and understanding to even be approached (or worse, insisted upon) by anyone else. As soon as you try to design moral philosophy that works the same way for more than one person, you've ruined its inherently individualistic nature.

INFPs often have a distinct habit of letting resentment and negativity build up toward someone until they're so incredibly upset that they can't help exploding into a Te-rundown of precisely everything you are doing wrong and why it's simply not acceptable in moral terms they can justify (Fi.) At least two INFP friends have told me that when they focus on explaining and resolving their grievances routinely and calmly before they have time to bottle up and fester into huge issues, they find themselves much more able to maintain the deep one-on-one connections they invariably must form with others, and to reach even greater personal understanding and empathy as a result.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Auxiliary: Extroverted iNtuition (Ne)**

As an auxiliary function, Ne grants INFPs both an awareness of and concern for how others perceive them, and the ability to explore, create, experiment, and play with new combinations and possibilities for different approaches and ways to change and recreate what they see around them, with an eye on how these exploratory outings will affect the perceptions and emotional states of others.

This is a crucial factor in the INFP's ability to apply Fi's uniquely individualistic values to an externally observable context in a way that both captures the attention and admiration of others and allows him to translate his inner passions into forms that others can understand, identify with, and appreciate. The INFP needs Ne in order to spread the message of his ideals to an audience that will listen: Ne is the bridge by which Fi's vision can be forged into the creations that serve as external representations of the INFP's identity.

""No need for greed or hunger / A brotherhood of man / Imagine all the people / Sharing all the world.""
--John Lennon, ""Imagine""

Ne often ends up expressing itself through artistic and creative endeavors: This penchant for interpreting and rearranging patterns of external phenomena frequently results in a particular knack for manipulation of language and its ability to say just the right thing to convey precisely the value or feeling the INFP wants to express, in a way that makes that feeling real for others. Indeed, INFPs are quite often found among novelists, musicians, graphic artists, screen writers, and all other forms of widely recognized creative expression by which the purity of their internal worlds (Fi) can be expressed externally (Ne).

At their best, INFPs are principled, idealistic, playful, creative, and deeply empathetic. Without the aid of auxiliary Ne, the INFP may become frustrated at the conflict between her intense desire for self-expression and her inability to translate the ideals she strives to live by into a medium that will touch the souls of others in the same way they define the meaning and purpose of her own life.

INFPs, because they show the outer world their flexible Ne side more readily, will appear much more open and accepting on the surface, and indeed they will remain that way as long as their interactions with you remain relaxed and enjoyable and do not require getting into serious ethical analysis or put them in any uncomfortable situations which might make them feel morally conflicted. They will appear flexible now (Ne), and steadfast later (Fi). They are generally open to all sorts of new experiences and connections between different experiences--they love to get at the heart of the people's true character by finding and comparing the ways in which different individuals have different unique ""flavors"", each offering its own special kind of meaning, and they love to observe the connections between different individuals in this regard. They may come off as rather reserved at first, but it doesn't take too long before they will at least open up Ne to you and relate to you on a surface level--this usually happens in terms of discussion about some common interest, such as art, philosophy, music, etc...anything that will seem interesting and noteworthy to the collective of people the INFP deems worthy.

Inside, however, they are far more rigid and unyielding in terms of the extraordinarily high ethical standards they place on themselves and anyone they consider close enough to be a trusted friend. When you become close to an INFP, you are accepting a responsibility to uphold the high personal standards that define the INFP's entire self-image and existential philosophy. INFPs will offer only the very best ethical treatment of their friends and loved ones, and they expect no less in return--if you cannot fulfill this sacred bond to the same level they hold themselves to, you should not commit to such a close relationship in the first place.

**Tertiary: Introverted Sensation (Si)**

For INFPs, the tertiary relief function Si is consulted in order to provide them quick reference to the real feelings and experiences that have affected them profoundly in their past experiences. Fi+Si doesn't consciously say, ""Ok, the last time this happened it caused a negative emotional reaction for me; therefore I will avoid it now""; Fi simply instinctively begins to experience the terrible emotional state Si has associated with whatever negative experience, and panic and dread take over, forcing the INFP to escape this situation at all costs, for fear of being forced into that state again. Fool me once, shame on you--fool me twice, shame on me.

I have seen INFPs who, once they begin to develop Si, start to pay very close attention to possible contaminants which could taint the purity of their physical bodies in the environment around them. They'll become extra careful to check food to make sure it hasn't gone bad, has the right nutritional content, etc. Some of them either insist on seeing a doctor more often than necessary, or become distrustful of doctors in general and avoid the experience, if they've had some negative past experience with doctors or medication (as, unfortunately, a fair number of INFPs have.) When applied positively though, it gives them a grounding into something real, something they can hold on to that they know will always be there for them because it always has been--this can be instrumental in leading the INFP into the spiritually aware and comfortable state she desires.

Development of tertiary Si helps the INFP connect her physical health and the needs of her body to the emotional and spiritual health upon which Fi is so heavily focused. As INFPs learn to pay more attention to Si, they will learn what conditions and surroundings are likely to lead them to better physical health, and recognize the enormous effect this will have on their emotional and spiritual health. As Si improves, they will appear to take a page from ISJs in their refusal to work under conditions that ""don't feel right"" in that they aren't conducive to promoting the calm, relaxed, and emotionally aware state under which their creative juices can flow most freely.

Most importantly, however, Si serves as a voice of caution and experience to help avoid the Ne trap of getting so lost in creative exploration that the INFP forgets where his comfort zone is and repeats the same painful mistakes again and again. INFPs with strongly pronounced Si will appear less naive, more world-weary, and perhaps a little bit more cynical--but it's generally for the best, as repeated negative experiences with being too trusting too quickly will teach them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Inferior: Extroverted Thinking (Te)**

For INFPs, Te ideally provides an objective counterpart to Fi's value judgments by allowing them to consider the importance of accomplishing real goals through real functional external world systems. This is very difficult for many INFPs to process because forcing any sort of cooperation on others for the good of a larger system (Te) is often seen as tantamount to destroying the right to express one's personal individuality at all costs (Fi.) This moral dilemma plagues many INFPs.

Te will, on occasion, pop out and result in the INFP blowing up and telling everyone in painstakingly objective detail how poorly they are living up the expected standards of their responsibilities. It kills the INFP to do this, because she wants so badly to respect others' right to personal individuality and self-expression, but ultimately she must recognize that some people will not voluntarily cooperate and must be forced to change for the good of society as a whole--nay, for the Good of Good itself!

As far as I can tell the line of reasoning goes something like this: ""You are not performing your moral duty to me as a friend (Fi), and every time I have been in a positive working relationship in the past (Si) it has followed certain standards (Te), and while I hate to do this, you are threatening my right to personal identity here (Fi) and thus I must explain to you objectively and very, very bluntly how your behavior cannot be tolerated (Te).""

The real issue for INFPs struggling with inferior Te is the conflict between Fi's idealistic, highly personalized individualism and Te's somewhat Machiavellian ends-justify-the-means, get-it-done-at-all-costs attitude. Ultimately, once Fi, Ne, and Si are satisfied, an INFP nearing total maturity should be able to recognize the value in the idea that sometimes, unconditional promotion of individual freedom of expression is simply not practical from a resource management standpoint, and that in order for society (or any other organization) to function meaningfully as a unit, some degree of personal individuality must, at times, be sacrificed.

Nonetheless, INFPs remain distrustful of any suggestion that people be ""forced into boxes"" or otherwise compelled to conform in any way that violates their sense of freedom of choice or private identity. As Te begins to balance this attitude, INFPs will gradually realize that actually creating the ideal utopian world they envision so naturally will require paying some attention to practical considerations, namely some form of objectively impersonal evaluation, and that this doesn't have to conflict with their ideals--it can, in fact, support and assist them in their quest to set all things right with the world.

And even if they never really find perfection, at least they'll have some degree of measurable success to point to--and that may be the only way to feel content in a world which will never truly live up to the perfectly harmonious ideals that Fi lives for.",,False,self,t5_2qn2o,False,,,True,t3_1cydk7,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1cydk7/infp_a_jungian_cognitive_function_analysis_by/,

""Man is only half himself; the other half is his expression.""

Shortly after that I discovered a collection of Emerson's essays and it was uncanny how similar his concerns and commentaries were to that of my own, only that he was able to articulate questions I'd previously asked myself in a far more eloquent manner that they could be applied to all manner of circumstances and existence: reverence for truthfulness to nature, a desire for purpose, truthfulness to self, an obsessive concern as to whether or not things I do will have ultimately remained appreciably relevant to myself in the future. I would highly recommend him to anybody on this subreddit, the definitive essay being ""Self-Reliance"" but I'd also suggest ""Nature"", ""Spiritual Laws"", ""Compensation"" and practically anything else you can get your hands on from him.

You guys can tell me if I'm wrong but as a blanket statement it seems like INFP jobs are difficult to find, and even when you do find them, the pay is mediocre. Obviously that is a generalization, but you all know what I mean.

I'm a 24 year old who has gone to college for 4 years (although I don't have the actual ""Bachelors"" due to transferring colleges and losing a bunch of credits - REALLY annoying, and finishing the degree is not financially in the cards at this time). My last job was working as a customer service rep on the phone for a life insurance company - absolutely hated it. Current job I process FMLA benefits for a health insurance company - really dislike this job overall too. Come to the conclusion that my ideal INFP job would involve the following:

* Very minimal contact with external ""customers"", if any contact at all
* Very consistent workload from day to day. I don't like being far ahead on work one day, and swamped the next.
* Positive work environment. Seems like a ""duh"" comment but a lot companies I've worked for have very ""by the books"" policies about how they want things done and any and all suggestions you have for process improvements are immediately shot down or fly up the chain of command and vanish never to be followed-up on.
* NO micromanagement. Hate when companies want something done in the exact steps of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I want to be able to see the problem, find a solution, and do it in my own way to allow the creative side of my brain to work. And I'm not 5 years old, I am responsible enough to make my own rationale decisions about what needs to be done when problems arise. Don't like when everything has to be reviewed by management first before it can be implemented.
* Work environment must promote creativity and allow me to produce my own projects that I feel will help the company.
* Job needs to be emotionally rewarding to my soul. Needs to be something that makes me feel like I actually have a positive influence on the world. Not just a ""it pays the bills"" job.
* Needs to be able to pay my bills - absolutely nothing less than $35-40K per year.

So, with all of that said, I can't really picture any jobs that meet those requirements, or if there are some out there, they're probably at Google or something and have 2,000 applicants.

I feel inspired to explore something I've struggled with for a while now. As I'm sure most of you can relate, at times I feel like I'm being pulled apart by two sides of myself. I'm reminded of the old saying ""life is what happens when you're busy making other plans"" (or something like that) So often when I'm nestled in my solitude I feel like I am missing out on something. Naturally, I rationalize with ""the grass is always greener"" but this feeling comes from such a core part of my being that it evokes a kind of existential panic. I'm so drawn to predicability, security and emotional tranquility but there is a side of me that longs for variety. 
	One of the most pivotal moments of my personal journey came once while I was listening to a lecture given by the daughter of Buckminster Fuller on the difference between artists and academics. It was my last year of college when I heard this, and it struck me so deeply that I often find my identity seeking release in the memory. Her basic message was this: the artist (or people drawn to the aesthetic world) is essentially a collector of experiences. They feel fulfilled when they experience things, as opposed to seeking knowledge about their world. I'm sure many of you can understand why I find this so profound. 
	I struggle with feeling idle in my life, like when my need for security imposes on my thirst for the unknown. Granted, I had a difficult childhood and the emotional security I've created in my life has it's place. But I find myself laying in bed some nights, thinking of the world going on and I'm plagued with guilt for not living up to my fullest potential. Traveling has always quelled these anxieties, as well as sharing trips with close friends. 
	I've had a tremendous passion for photography for many years because of this feeling. When I travel or go on little adventures with friends and I come home with a collection of photos that I feel really validate my experiences, I feel satisfied; I feel whole. Thing is, my photos hardly ever contain people. This is because I love to wander off knowing that everyone is gathered in one place and I can feel like an outsider and still belong. This is when I feel closest to my favorite world. I once read something by Eckhart that really summed up that feeling. He offered a word (istigkeit?) which means something like ""isness"". When I'm in this headspace, my very being feels validated. When I stray from it, I feel empty. Photography has always been a way for me to rediscover this world. However, I get panicked when I feel like the security I long for seems to stamp out some smoldering internal fire that sends up smoke to lure me home.

For example, meeting a new person, I'll try to hang on to what they're saying, but I end up paying attention to their mannerisms, how their shirt reminds me of someone but I can't remember who, and how the person to my left seems annoyed but hasn't mentioned it yet, and how the person in the far right corner of the room wants to be included in the conversation and is nodding and smiling accordingly. Man, that is an odd pin she has on. Is it from Etsy? I bet its from Etsy.

Same thing in class, or at work.

I find myself paying rapt attention to behaviors, mannerisms, and tacit social cues than to what I should be hearing, reading, or learning. I'm pretty torn about it too, as I feel like I have a richer understanding of those I interact with, but have missed the point of being there. 

Another example would be playing a board or a video game. I don't really care about winning (especially as compared to most people), I just want to have the experience of playing: examining the game pieces, admiring the game art, roaming around and seeing what there is to see...

Does this even make sense? I know this might also sound like ADHD (which I have been diagnosed with), but I'm wondering if there might be something more nuanced going on here.

1343454043.0,34,self.infp,xadf8,"That lingering uncertainty over whether anything you do will be worthwhile, and the fear that your efforts have no meaning",ThoreauIsCool,40,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/xadf8/that_lingering_uncertainty_over_whether_anything/,"There are no pillars in my life. I have never been romantically involved or gained any meaningful employment. And throughout life my pursuits have flip-flopped all over the place, between writing, art, design, modding video games, and many other things. There's just no simple title or other means of describing me succinctly. Sometimes I feel as though I don't even have a determinate identity. I'm just sort of...there. Existing. It's unusual. In the company of friends I feel as though I'm not as valued as the others are - they seem to blend in so well. When they can't make it to a social gathering, people appear to be more inconvenienced than they would be if I told them I couldn't make it. They seem to laugh with one another with a greater sense of kinship than I feel when I'm a part of it. I feel distanced.

There's lots of things I want to accomplish in my life. The main one right now is an independent oldschool RPG that I and some associates have been gradually developing for years now. It's really the only thing I look forward to right now, and a part of me feels incredibly broken and defeated about all of the intermediate stuff in between. If all goes according to plan, we could take off as an independent studio once this project is done. And it makes me think - why am I even in college? It seems like my narrowminded plan is to use it as a distraction for 4 years, and then maybe I'll make use of my degree for another one or two years, before throwing all of that effort out to focus on game design.

If that's the case, why even invest the additional time and money into secondary education in the first place? I'd probably be just as complacent working in retail in the meantime, and it would (in the short term, at least) be less financially crippling. I really have difficulty convincing myself that school is even worthwhile in that case. So many people say that everyone changes their job at some point or another, so, again, why not cut out the middle man and not even bother throwing your money away at that degree? I'm being impractical, I'm sure - but I've been in a very somber mood as of late. You need a job, and money, that's the reasoning behind getting secondary education out of the way as soon as possible - but I think if that's the logic behind it I may as well be learning a trade or something, because either way I don't know how much I'm going to care ten years from now.

A more personal example. I'm at a point in life where I'm thinking of returning to art. Pursuing a general BA in Visual Arts at my school. I don't know what kind specifically, but I have always enjoyed art and design and every moment of my life has been dedicated to creating things of character and expression - that give one a sense of a particular place or time, and mood. I'm not amazing at artwork, but for me it's like a drug, the only thing in my life that I still strive to improve in, and the only thing left that completely captivates me and gives me that focus and childlike whimsy that I seldom feel in day-to-day doings.

I've been practicing drawing regularly all summer, and yet there's always that lingering sense of doubt. I have never committed to anything in my life - and almost have an aversion to being identified as a particular person. I drifted effortlessly through school, did whatever interested me at home, but have never had anyone truly demand anything of me. Now I'm in college and have to decide. And I attempt to look five/ten years down the line, where I'd be if I simply devoted most of my efforts to art, and I just don't know if I can do it.

I'm not sure how much of that is self-doubt, and how much of it is laziness. My problem is that I feel as if everything I do has to pay off in the long term - I'm extremely bad at discarding ideas for fear I'll never come up with anything better. I attempt to compromise between projects and mesh things together rather than focusing on quality.

I don't know what it is, but I just can't move my life in any direction. There's always stories of people in their 40's and 50's suddenly dropping their unfulfilling government cubicle jobs and then opening a restaurant or something, so I know that as a 19 year old I still have plenty of time. My dad always tells me that ""all knowledge is good knowledge."" And yet I'm reluctant to focus on any one thing anymore, for fear that 5 years down the line I'll discard it and it'll have been wasted time that I could've spent on something that would get me more success and repute.

Not to say I necessarily want that, of course. But companies seem to be structured more around seniority and blind obedience than actual technical skill. I think the only work I'll ever find to be truly gratifying is the work I create for myself. I feel as if I'm running myself ragged thinking I need to design a perfectly balanced and efficient lifestyle, where everything will remain useful to me in the long term. I've become extremely paranoid about compromise in my life - something people say is inevitable, and yet I just don't understand - is this the normal mode of living for people? It seems so...dishonest. And I lack the drive to commit to anything, so I wouldn't even know.

Do other INFPs feel this sort of culture shock? Is there anything that can be done, or do you think we're all f*cked in the long term and will always regret what you didn't choose to do?

The kicker for me was the fireworks show at the end. You know, the iconic one they always show on commercials. I like fireworks, so, sure, I'll stay for that, I thought. 

It was mindblowing. The fireworks were huge, colorful, and synchronized with the music and the lights projected onto the castle. There were flying realistic animatronic creatures and lyrics about dreams coming true and...I cried. Not sobbing, but it was hugely overwhelming. I'm a grown lady and I cried.

I think very much in metaphors, both in writing and in rhetoric. I've found metaphors to help make sense of my immense depth of feeling, so as to help me better explain myself to others. Here's a few noteworthy examples of what I'm talking about that have occurred recently:

Today I was running a quick errand, driving on a country road, when I spotted a cute little turtle crawling across the road. He was near the double yellow lines. I quickly became very emotional and wanted to help the poor thing across. But I didn't. I kept driving. The guilt and horrible angst I felt! The turtle was just trying to get to the other side of the road, where his life would be better and brighter. And I was too selfish to get out and help. (If you can't tell, I thought of this event as a giant metaphor to my own life). When I arrived at my destination, I rushed to get things done just so that I could drive back and make sure he made it okay. The guilt, by this point, was weighing me down, and I knew defiantly I would help him cross now (or weep over his crushed shell). I saw no trace of him as I drove back. Perhaps a [better] soul helped him across. I felt relieved.

The other day, a massive fly was buzzing about my house, causing concern (as I have a moderate fly/bee/insect phobia). I finally cornered him in the bathroom, where he found the window screen. He kept bouncing off it, trying desperately to get to the outside. Meanwhile, I shut the window behind him, so that he was now trapped between the glass and the screen. Given, this fly was huge, so his full-body hammering away at the screen was quite loud. But I left the room thinking nothing of it. Hell, I was almost spiteful. However, minutes later, I couldn't help but think how cruel it was to trap such an innocent being and torture it to death. I couldn't help but think of how it would feel if *I* was put in that situation, trapped between a rock and a hard place. I let him go in the end. He hasn't bugged me since.

This was by far the weirdest experience of my life, and it scares me a little.

One day when I was 14, my mom and I were driving to some place many miles away and we stopped in this little country town so she could go get directions (or something, I can't remember), so I was left in the car with my Nintendo DS. I had bought a cartridge that allowed me to (veeeeery slowly) browse the internet if I could find a wifi network.

Well, I check the wifi list and the first one that pops up is some nearby small charity, and it's encrypted; but from the moment I saw the name on the wifi, I knew *exactly* what kind of people they were (not like ""oh it's one of *those* people, I mean I could just sense their personality based on the name), and I *knew* I could guess their password. Like, I just understood completely. It was like a dream, because I didn't ever feel like I was trying, it just came to my head, this understanding, in a moment of incredibly intense intuition.

I typed in my guess, but knew immediately that I had gotten the last letter wrong and it rejected me. I typed it again, but this time the one that *felt* right, and holy shit, *I got in.*

I didn't even understand the magnitude of that until later. It was a *string of random letters and numbers*, and I had just fucking *understood* what it was. I had just typed it out, based on their *name*.

I don't believe in psychics or anything like that, but that was neither the first nor the last time I experienced intense moments of intuition and just knew things that I couldn't have known. I rationalize it as a deep, almost animal intuition, like how fish in schools all know where to swim. It's always happened when I'm really relaxed/not thinking.

So, um, I'm really hoping that someone else has experienced stuff like this, because it honestly kind of scares me and I feel like a crazy person. Googling stuff like this obviously only brings up psychic and palm reading websites, which isn't exactly helpful....",,False,self,t5_2qn2o,False,,,True,t3_1clbff,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1clbff/do_you_guys_ever_experience_moments_of_almost/,

(I feel like the precedent set in the good times thread really suits the whole infp vibe)

When I am presented with a gap in my knowledge, especially something that I care about deeply, I tend to freeze up in terror / self disgust / jealousy of more knowledgable or capable people. This is a problem. It makes learning new things difficult. It also makes it considerably harder to live up to the infp-esque ideals I set for myself.

I am a singer-songwriter, but I'm self taught and have no knowledge of music theory. I fantasise about being properly musically capable, but if I try to teach myself, I invariably end up dwelling lugubriously or violently (depending on my mood) on my lack of skill and knowledge, rather than focussing on how to improve. I'm mentally blocked by the size of it, like a man afraid to swim in the colossal ocean. I feel like it's too big, and it'll eat me - it's almost vertiginous.

Other than a probable connection with anxiety, I'm interested; does this lamped-by-knowledge phenomenon sound familiar? My experience of other infps is that, although they may not be balanced in their knowledge, they tend to have a particular area that they care about, voraciously consume literature on, and become extremely well versed in.

I was introduced over ten years ago (before I even knew I was INFP) and found it hard to explain why I was so attracted to the music of this depressed loner who killed himself with antidepressants back in the early 70s. In retrospect, I think one of the biggest reasons (aside from my love for his guitar chops) is that from his lyrics and behavior he seems to be a classic INFP. 

I don't yet know enough about the Jungian functions to analyze which preferences exhibit themselves where in his songwriting (maybe some of our more experienced members would?), but at this stage I do feel like I have a pretty good hunch (Ne?) for picking out other INFPs, if only because I relate to so much of what he confessed in his songs. 

Anyway, just wanted to see if anyone else here sees Nick as a kindred spirit. Please share lyrics if you have any favorites. I'll start:

""I Was Made to Love Magic""

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8ot0JkFUu8

(this is far from my favorite of his musically. He wrote it when he was still a teenager so you kind of have to view it in that context. It didn't even make the cut onto any of his three official albums, ending up on the posthumous ""odds and sods"" release *Time of No Reply* with a truly cheesy orchestral arrangement. The version I linked above is a 2004 re-working with the originally-intended Robert Kirby accompaniment--much better IMHO. But anyway, the reason I chose this song to lead off with is that I just feel these lyrics are INFP to the nth.)

I was born to love no one

No one to love me

Only the wind in the long green grass

The frost in a broken tree.


I was made to love magic

All its wonder to know

But you all lost that magic

Many many years ago.


I was born to use my eyes

Dream with the sun and the skies

To float away in a lifelong song

In the mist where melody flies.


I was made to love magic

All its wonder to know

But you all lost that magic

Many many years ago.


I was born to sail away

Into a land of forever

Not to be tied to an old stone grave

In your land of never.


I was made to love magic

All its wonder to know

But you all lost that magic

Many many years ago.

Okay. I think I've figured my life out (kind of).

This is kind of hard to articulate, but basically in the past year I’ve become increasingly aware of the reasoning and ego behind every single course of action I might take. It’s to the point where all of the little everyday choices seem like huge, important, self-defining decisions. I guess I have no idea how to follow a moral compass, which is leading to crippling indecision in every aspect of my life.

I have trouble getting myself to buy things I need because spending money makes me feel guilty. I can’t use social networking websites anymore because I feel like I’m indulging my vanity or trying to get attention (some might consider this a good thing, but it has become very isolating as I just moved to a new country in the past year and feel like I’m losing touch with my few friends). I have trouble thinking about the future at all. It makes me incredibly anxious. I suppose most people feel that way, though. Shoot, I can barely decide which socks to wear! It's exhausting. 

I’m sorry if this post seems angsty. I felt like other infps might relate, based on the idealistic and perfectionist tendencies we generally have. Do any of you struggle with this kind of thinking? Do you have any advice or words of wisdom?

And if not then oh well we get to know each other a little bit. :) 


tl;dr: what do you like, what is your passion?

I would have to say that my favorite thing is brown eyes, well eyes in general but particularly brown ones, I also love music and pretty much anything artsy that will get my creative rivers flowing. 


I am passionate about showing people love. Not relationship love but  love that says you are a person too and your thoughts and actions matter. I am especially passionate about showing this to the youth of today because middle and high school is a hard time in everyone's life and it's worse when you are being neglected by your family. I feel like the message that they get told often is that they aren't important and they don't matter, and i'm trying to change that message.

Aka I think I may be a shitty person,Thatguywiththename1,28,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1jh1uq/infps_and_relationships_aka_i_think_i_may_be_a/,"So based on my limited experience in relationships (2.5, still in high school), I've noticed that I have some patterns I seem to follow that are kind of unhealthy. I know I'm definitely not the only infp that finds it difficult to communicate your feelings well (like my understanding of myself is mostly not on a verbal level) and entirely honestly in a relationship, especially when it is about something that (you feel) could hurt the other person. I.e. my girlfriend talks about how much she misses me when I'm gone among other things, and I feel like I kind of exaggerate the truth in order to make her feel good, but I feel fake and eventually it'll take it's toll and end up hurting her more in the end if I ever break down and explain that. It happened in my last relationship, essentially because I let a bunch of little moments like that where I had something to say but I didn't say it, or didn't say it how I meant it, in order to prevent what I believe would make her feel bad. I was too much of a wuss to even deal with that kind of minor conflict, and then (from her perspective) I just kind of up and left for no good reason (shittily explained on my part due to precisely that aversion to making people feel bad). It didn't even achieve its aim, it made her feel terrible, I just wasn't there to see it. Thus getting to the ""I'm a hypocrite and shitty person"" part. I can be a 'perfectionist' and think/talk about how things should be (idealize) all I want, but I end up just building a wall of niceness and people pleasing (not being honest about my feelings/reasons for my feelings) to disguise the shallow, petty reasons I do a lot of things. Example, my current girlfriend asks me why I care so much for her and why I go to so much effort to convince her she's worth it, and in the back of my mind I know the real reason that I hardly even admit to myself is that I'm sexually attracted to her and not much else, but I said something nice about how she shouldn't think she's a waste of time to anyone...

I'm here today to ask for your help. And I think at least some of you can understand how hard that is for me to do.

I'm a patron of the arts. I love music, and I plan on becoming a band director later in life. I'm going into my junior year of high school, I'm 16 years old, and I've been writing narrative since I was ten. I started drawing last year, too. But here's where the problems start.

Last year, I started writing on an online community (I've administrated one for a while, but this was somewhere I could get actual critique rather than teaching and writing). It lasted about a month. I received such negative feedback that I stopped. 

I'll keep it short and get to the modern day. I can't look at DeviantArt's front page or that of communities like FiMFiction. Because everytime I do, I see people who do infinitely better than me, and I fill up with rage and misery and self-loathing, so much that I have to leave the site before it just breaks me down. My best friend/bromance wants me to get back on the saddle with him, so we can write and draw and learn together. After a few nights of bad fighting and me being resistant, he coaxed me into reading a story on FiMFiction for the first time in a year. After I got over my defense mechanism of caustic criticism, I began enjoying it, and it's advanced to where I want to get back to writing so I can rank myself among the great authors of the internet. 

But now I want to go further. I want to break my nearly endless cycle of considering, trying, reconsidering, and quitting because I feel like I can never succeed, that everyone else will always be better than me. It's been hurting my best friend to see me in such an emotional mess, and we care about each other deeply; He doesn't want me hurt, but he doesn't want to enable my self-destructive habits anymore. 

So now I've come to you, /r/INFP. I need your help, your advice, your encouragement, whatever you think or know will help me. I want to get over this inferiority complex and get back to what I love without a constant loathing for being inferior. I know INFPs are usually the more sensitive and self-conscious MBTI, and almost always the most artistic. Whatever you think will help me kill this, I'll try.

As INFP types we strongly feel the suffering of others due to our excessive empathy in one way or another, physically and emotionally. For me it's my shoulders, like weight being crushed down as I continue to collect more of the suffering emotions as I look at the faces of those involved. It's the same with any other tragic event or observation that hits the heart, with the difference being the intensity at which it strikes. 

As an individual, it is and always will be hard to be an INFP, I've accepted that. But as a collective force of INFPs, the weight we feel can be shared, and when we share the weight, the load on the individual starts to dwindle, and the limit to which we can bear becomes much harder to reach. I say this because when tragic events like the one today happen, remember that you are not alone in your empathetic suffering, and that there are many others out there who not only understand, but also **feel the importance of leading those around us toward compassion and seeing the world through the eyes of others versus a clenched fist and an angry voice,** which is what the majority seems to jump right into. 

That is our unique gift as an INFP, and the one reminder that always brings me comfort at such times, along with knowing that I am well connected to those who can feel the world the way I do.

I apologize in advance. This might be a longish post. I am grateful for your time and extra thankful for anything you can tell me.

My sister (and best friend) is going through a really rough patch in her life. She's in her thirties. She's in an off-again, on-again relationship that eats at her, emotionally and mentally. She feels like she's got no one around her to rely on, and she is dealing with a number of debilitating health issues. She is an INFP, and I'm an INTJ (we are both fans of the MBTI). I'm also 10 years younger than her, and on the other end of the country.

My sister has been struggling with depression, and she's made a few remarks that just absolutely break my heart. During one of our frequent phone calls, she mentioned that she identified with a lot of the things that were in a famous INFP's suicide note, and she also mentioned that INFP's have a high suicide rate. A few weeks later she said that she wasn't sure how she could ""keep going"" if her health got worse.

I love her more than anyone in the world, but I feel like a failure when it comes to consoling her or even just ""being there"" with her in her pain. I know I can't ""cheer her up"" and make all her problems disappear, I just wish I had something, *anything* I could say besides ""I love you so much and I believe things will get better soon.""

I've never shared this with anyone, but mainly because I've never thought to - my mind is like my private sanctum, and I don't like to share it's contents unless I feel comfortable - and I do here, so..  Here it is.**

----

So I just discovered this subreddit and find it neat that each of the personality types have their own subs that are fairly active, so I thought I'd participate.

This question or something like it has probably been posted before, but I just found this sub and didn't feel like digging. Plus, I was hoping for a fresh discussion and to be able to add my own input.  We INFPs are obviously very cerebral and inward people who spend a lot of time in our thoughts, but of coarse that doesn't mean we all think the same way or the same things. So, what is it like inside your specific mind? What kinds of things do you enjoy thinking about? When do you find that you think the most, and when/where are you the most productive? What quirks do you have that might be a little different than others.

I hold a very boring job to get me through college. In my department, we see a lot of people come and go very quickly because they can't handle the mundanity of the job. It *can* get fast paced and a little hectic, but more often than not it is very menial, boring, keep-yourself-busy type work. I have been at this job for three years, meaning of all the people currently in the department, I've been there the longest. I often wonder why it is that I stayed when so many other people obviously couldn't handle it, and I think the answer is that I have a natural tendency to retract myself into my own thoughts when I'm bored. For people who don't do a lot of thinking and would rather be ""doing things,"" I could see how my job might suck for them. But for me, I just tend to get lost in my thoughts.

It's not to say that I enjoy work, because I absolutely dread it and I slack off at every available opportunity - but I think I manage because I can at least keep myself entertained inside my mind for the most part.

Sometimes I'll come up with ideas, like new things to try in video games (Minecraft, The Sims, Etc.) or set goals for myself when I get home, like ""I should play this game,"" or ""research this topic,"" Etc. That seems pretty straight-foward, though - I'm sure a lot of people spanning many personality types do that.

Another thing I've noticed, though, is that I have an ""inner monologue"" in my head that, I believe, originated due to the boredom of this job mixed with the fact that I'm an English/film major and thus have exposure to a lot of literature and movies that contain this type of monologue. What I mean by monologue is that in my head, it sounds as if I'm writing my thoughts down into a novel written in the first person.  An example might be something like, ""I noticed three girls heading toward me.  One of them was wearing a red shirt, but it was an interesting tone of red, one which I was not accustomed to seeing very often which threw me off guard. By the way they were dressed, I assumed they had probably just came in from a long day at the pool.""  It's kind of just me narrating my life as if I were writing a novel or providing the voice over monologue for a film. It's not always about things I'm witnessing, but can also be about events that had passed, or just ideas in general. I don't typically remember them after the fact unless they're extremely profound, which they typically aren't. Writing it out makes it seem really weird, but that's how I've become accustomed to thinking these days. I think one reason I started doing it was to practice my writing form - I figure that I can't actually practice writing at work, but if I think as if I *were* writing, then perhaps that could somehow count as practice. And it does help.. I find that a lot of times I have a certain rhythm to the prose set up beforehand, as if I know what it should sound like before I think it, but often I have to leave blanks because I can't think of the proper adjective or other words that should go there, so then I have to go back and try to fill them in. Sometimes I'm successful, but other times I get stumped and move on. The more I do it, however, the better I get at describing things on the fly. I feel like it builds my vocabulary in a way that your run of the mill thought process would not, and as someone who hopes to excel in writing some day, every little bit counts. I think it's a very nifty exercise, and I like to think it will improve upon my writing. However, I did just notice that I subconsciously do it more than I originally thought I did - I just now caught myself thinking in 1st person without having premeditated doing it. I hope that's not a bad thing.. what the fuck is ""normal,"" anyway?

So that's one interesting quirk of mine.. another one I have is probably going to come off as even weirder. But, this is all about sharing thought processes, what it's like in our specific minds, so here goes: I often imagine that in some parallel universe, the events of my life are portrayed in a book/TV show/movie/comic series/Etc. I spend a *lot* of time thinking about this, just to pass the time. First and foremost, my life is so boring that no one, ever, would watch/read such a thing.. I'm aware of that. However, I still do it anyway. And actually, this isn't a recent endeavor.. I've done this for as long as I can remember. I remember doing it as a kid.. It's not wonder I developed an interest for film/story telling, because it's obviously had it's influence on me from a very young age.. 

Anyway.. One thing I might think about is what actors from our universe would best portray people in my life. I have a couple for this, but not a lot, and I've never come across anyone who could play me. For instance, I used to work with a girl that reminded me a lot of Gillian Jacobs from Community, so I figured she'd be the best bet. I also work with a grumpy old man that I feel could easily be portrayed, quite humorously, by J. K. Simmons. I imagine what this ""show"" would be like, and how, if I were producing it, I could make it more appealing. I think about things such as whether or not the town I live in is a fictional town in this other universe, and if it's name carries any significant meaning to the show overall, like subtly hinting at some characteristic of mine or of the show in general. I take notice of little minor details in my life and try to conjure up what kind of messages they might have for this non-existent audience - things like numbers that pop up more than once in the ""series"" that might mean something to them that *I*, as a character in my universe and not theirs, am not supposed to understand.  It's all very complex, and I feel very strange for having never grown out of it - but the thing is, I always have led quite a boring life, and I have to think that perhaps this arose as a coping mechanism. My life was not interesting, so I found a way to *make* it interesting in my head by making it seem glamorous, if only to a group of people that don't actually exist..

But I don't want to depress you guys... What I do want is to know what goes on inside your heads. We're INFP's, we're known for our vivid imaginations.. we are dreamers, after all!

I find that combined with an existential philosophy I dont see why anything wouldnt be possible as long as you were dedicated to it enough. Sometimes reality - circumstance, other people - get in the way however and that causes a lot of grief. I guess Salinger's Holden and Camus' Meursault are also strangely similar.

Perhaps it's because I tend to get ahead of myself and think more about finished projects than all of the trivialities and tedium that go into their design. It's nice to be able to shape something real in your hands, that serves as a constant reminder of your progress and that you're not losing your direction. I've always loved doing handiwork like sculpture and woodworking, even if I'm not the master of them. It tends to be a part of our nature to lean towards doing creative work.

Much like getting away from life and immersing yourself in the outdoors, there's something bucolic to be had in working on real, tangible things. Being led by your senses, so to speak, and settling into a certain state of flow and tranquility. It's a welcome respite from the day-to-day chaos of having to negotiate with people and getting caught up in your brooding thoughts. I used to pride myself as being a man of logic, ""feelings bad reason good"", but I've come to realize that people can't be that one-sided and whilst sitting around and theorycrafting is an easy distraction from reality, it tends to detach me from it and worsen my mood.

It's weird in a way. I don't know any other people my age (I'm 19) who like doing stuff like this. I feel like an old person, to be honest.

When I was a kid, money was just like Chuck-E-Cheese tokens that I could trade for things I wanted.  A perfect example of this is a little episode that happened one time when I was attending my childhood friend's baseball game.  Before the game, he went up to the snack booth and (from my perspective) traded one piece of money for some gum, and the person at the register gave him a bunch of pieces of money in return.  Looking back I realize he was breaking a large bill, probably his birthday money, and the man at the register was giving him change.  But from my perspective as a kid, he had just hit the lottery or been given a bunch of free tokens or something.  So when he entrusted his change to me, telling me I could get a few things if I wanted, of course I went shit crazy and bought at least 20 bucks worth of candy throughout those 9 innings.

Through repeated chastisements and corrections on how to use money, I didn't ever actually improve too much on recognizing the value of money, and instead I developed an intense anxiety over it.  I actually used to make my little brother pay at registers for me.  Still to this day, as a 20 year old man, I cannot pay at a register without fumbling around with bills, dropping coins, and stuttering.

But I hate standing up there alone and going through progressions trying to make a melody. I'm really bad at it; that's partly because I don't practice, and partly because I hate the idea of it. It's killing me on the inside, especially because at the end of the semester I have to play for a 'jury' of faculty who determine if I pass or fail the course (obviously depending on the rigor and quality of the performance). Apparently it's required for me to improvise a few choruses of a tune. It's too late to withdraw from the course.

I've reached that critical point where I want out—where things are so conflicted and hard that I want to leave it and be done with it... I'm far out of my comfort zone. My teacher stands there and has me improvise over a backing track and as I'm playing I literally shut down. I hate it. I don't want to do it. I won't do it.

These sorts of things seem to be recurrent in my life. I don't know what to do about them. Being bipolar [and chronically depressed] doesn't help. I just want to break down and cry every time this happens. I usually do, too.

I can't remember when or how the symbolic image and its meanings first occurred to me, but ever since they did they've always been part and parcel of my identity.

To me, the archetypal knightess/knight represents a dedication to fighting injustice, doing what I can to help, and spreading the faith (non religious/non spiritual, it should be noted) I have in people to those who might benefit from it. These days I obviously don't swing a sword around for a living (although how cool would *that* be?) but I do feel that I live out these values in a more modern way: I'm going to graduate school for conflict resolution, am planning on joining either a courthouse or peacekeeping/mediation firm, and do a lot of canvassing, activism and community organizing in my free time. 

In a way, I feel like I've always been defined by the ""knight/ess"" in part, and over time have slowly translated the more archetypal manifestation of my values into something concrete and real.

So, that said, I suppose what I wanted to ask was is if this kind of thing resonated with anyone else? Do any of you feel an intense connection to a particular fictional archetype/symbol?

I read for half the day about it and absolutely every piece of credible information I found described who I am. This was the first time I've ever read a description of what I'm like without it being labeled a disorder. 

I've spent the last few years trying to figure out why I feel like I'm so different from ""regular"" people and for ways to make myself more sociable or likable. Less awkward or embarrassed. I wanted more friends. I wanted everyone to like me - not who I am now, but who I thought I could become.  

Now, I'm a type. I daydream and see things that other people don't. I say strange things and it takes ages for someone I meet to consider being friends with me. This is the best thing I've ever experienced. I AM rare and different. I'm not socially awkward. I'm not anti-social. I'm careful with my words and with my close friends. 

This is the best I've ever felt about myself. 

So the whole point of this post is to hopefully inspire some other INFPs.

1320581437.0,22,self.infp,m2bnp,I am an INFP and a longtime typology enthusiast. There's some major misconceptions around here that need to be cleared up.,omarfw,29,7,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/m2bnp/i_am_an_infp_and_a_longtime_typology_enthusiast/,"First off, the MBTI is one of the worst typology systems out there as it is horribly misused, inaccurate and easily subject to stereotyping and misinformation. It does not accommodate the different variables that can occur within each INFP, instead opting to lump them in as one personality and claiming 'these people are all the same'. That is not true and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that. It is great for beginners, but has massive problems if one takes it too seriously. There are definitely similarities between all INFPs but they are far from all alike.

The MBTI is just a dumbed down archetype of the Jungian cognitive functions which are far more legitimate. They allow for variance and encourage one to look at the building blocks of their personality as something that can be improved upon, rather than something that is set in stone. Everyone uses all of the functions that make up all of us. I only use the MBTI labels for convenience sake as they are popular.

The MBTI does not even begin to scratch the surface of my personality nor does it yours and you should not treat it like some kind of all encompassing category that you cannot escape the bindings of.

Allow me to explain what being an INFP really means.

**Introvert** - This does not equate to social behavior of any kind. Our introversion originates from our dominant function being Fi or 'Introverted Feeling'. This function deals with the formation of ethics and principles. We project these internal principles onto the external world in the form of judgment. Since we are Fi dominant, everything we interact with must go through our internal 'filter' and be evaluated appropriately. That is just one type of introversion as there are four different introverted functions which other types have as their dominant function.

**How does this apply to life?** - INFPs are labeled anti-social when really we are just selective. I do not enjoy 'raw' social interaction with people I don't know. I would much prefer hanging out with people that I have had time to 'evaluate' appropriately and when someone subjects social interaction upon me without my consent I become anxious. We are 'judgement before interaction' and many people out there are the exact opposite so they see people like us being quiet and assume we must dislike social interaction when that is not true. If I don't like someone, I am **not** going to pretend to like them and talk to them anyway as I see that as an infringement upon my principles. I only break that rule when it is necessary to defend another one.
As far as Introverts needing time by themselves, this is true for the majority but is not inherent to introversion as it can be overcome, just like extraverts can overcome their need for interaction and stimulus.

*Do not label yourself an anti-social person unless you legitimately shun all forms of socialization. It is not inherent to being an introvert or an INFP.*

**iNtuitor** - Our intuition originates from our auxiliary Ne function or 'Extraverted Intuition' which is our primary source of interaction with external things. Ne deals with finding all of the different external possibilities in both in the short term and long term sense. Coupled with the idealistic tendencies of dominant Fi, this is what causes us to be labeled 'the dreamer' since many of us often 'dream' of more ideal possibilities we see vividly. Ne has more uses than that though obviously. It allows us to take something that exists and improve upon it because we see a 'better' version of it in our heads. We paint our minds onto the canvas around us.

**How does this apply to life?** - Being able to go through each feasible possibility is useful and keeps us open-minded but it can be hindering during conversation when we are expected to give an answer to someone. While our Ne is still going through possible answers, our Fi doesn't want us to just blurt out some random, unfinished or generic response. We want our conversations and the things we say to be something beyond the average banter. Basically, we are 'perfectionistic' conversationalists which isn't something that works well in a society dominated by small talk. Because of this the world labels us as socially inept when they really just don't understand the thought process happening in our heads. This is why many of us tend to be better at writing as writing gives us the time we require to get everything we want to say just right. The same applies to things like online forms of communication which are not real-time.
Ne helps us be creative and very open-minded but when it dwarfs our entire perception we can submerge ourselves in these possibilities too much which can potentially lead to depression or anxiety. The presence of an potential undesirable situation, no matter how distant in the future, can be troubling to us. We can spend hours mulling over different versions of a conversation we recently had (or one we haven't had yet) to the point of needless anxiety. This is not something that cannot be overcome.

*It is not some kind of psychic power and sensors are not somehow happier or less intelligent than you. They just prefer to think in the now, while you do not.*

**Feeler** - Like I said before, your dominant function is Fi therefore you are Feeler preferred. You base your decisions around your own internal ethics and principles. This has nothing to do with your emotions. However, many of us tend to place strong importance in our emotions because we make it part of our ethics to do so. These ethics and policies are usually based around the events of our past. The reason I got into typology for example is because like many other INFPs I grew up never really fitting in with society and since typology has helped me overcome that, I want to help spread this knowledge to other INFPs to help them which is why I'm willing to sit here and type up this much shit on Reddit at 4am. That is a choice I made based on my ethics. Any emotions I feel as a result of my past are a side effect, not a cause or motivation.

**How does this apply to life?** - When I am sad I do not ever want to ignore that sadness in exchange for happiness because I place equal importance in both as they both make up who I am equally. Therefore rather than shun my sadness, I embrace it and submerge myself in it. If I am to feel something, I choose to feel it 100%. This is what makes people see us as depressed, bipolar or emotionally unstable. In reality we are probably some of the most emotionally stable because we have more choice in the matter than most people, but we choose to do the opposite of what most people would choose because it makes us feel alive. We are able to be happy just as much as we are able to be sad, angry, scared etc. A truly depressed or bipolar person does not have that luxury.

*Being an Fi dominant Feeler does not make you weak, emotional or a crybaby. It makes you passionate and human. It gives you personal standards. It provides the drive to fight for things you believe in even if others don't and to challenge the status quo if need be.*

**Perceiver** - A 'Perceiver' according to the MBTI is someone who prefers to stay flexible and free of constricting quotas, deadlines, time limits, unnecessary organization etc. This is mostly due to the fact that we are Ne users and do not like to dedicate ourselves to only one possibility.
I can agree with this definition as it is mostly true behaviorally but it also implies that we are incapable of planning and doing the opposite which is not true. We may have to learn how to do that, but once we do it is not an issue. Being a perceiver is a product of preference, not some static personality trait that induces inherent unchangeable weaknesses.
We adapt ourselves to things as we go because we know that planning for only one set of potential issues can lead to us following through incorrectly sometimes. Calenders and schedules do not allow for 'What if?'

What being a perceiver means from a Jungian standpoint is more significant. For example, look at the difference between these two function sets.

INFP - Fi Ne Si Te|Fe Ni Se Ti

INFJ - Ni Fe Ti Se|Ne Fi Te Si

As you can see, the function order of an INFP and an INFJ are completely different and these two types are indeed very different. Yet, the MBTI would have you believe that these two types have only minor differences because all that's changed is a single letter. This is what is wrong with the MBTI. It puts dumb traits on us like ""INFPs avoid conflict at all costs"" when that only applies to the majority of INFPs, not absolutely all of them.

And with that, I go to bed. I will answer any questions in the morning. Goodnight fellow INFPs.

I cried more at school than my fellow children, and being male there's an added sense of distraught discomfort at the implications of this; so I became the clown.

I would adopt character traits which weren't genuine. Once I claimed that the song ""Jingle-bell rock"" reminded me of a time when I walked into a retirement home and saw a bunch of old people dancing, and that the experience was so scarring and terrifying (made reference to wrinkled, sagging skin swaying in motion to the music) that every time I heard it, the memories would flood back like a war flashback or something. This got a few laughs, but I had to keep this lie going for a long time (probably longer than I should have) and had to act like I hated this song, which I actually kind of liked, and while insinuating that old people dancing is a terrible, disgusting thing, when in actuality, happens to be a beautiful thing.

When it's all about sex, like going out to a bar or party and engaging in that kind of hookup game, you never have a chance to see that inner self. It's all about man body and woman body. Freaks.

You guys are really comforting to discuss with, so I'll post it here instead of r/confession or something. Feel free to post any dissent on that.

I'm very timid to most who don't know me at all, and end up feeling incredibly shy when I'm with people my age. I've had a couple of groups and clubs that I just never got into because I didn't socialize well, and I'm okay with that, I suppose. I'm working on it.

On the other hand, when I warm up to people I get very energetic and impulsive around long-time friends, with little regard for my own self-esteem. Even on the internet it's sort of the same; I'm so shy around people, even in Skype calls, but after like a year and a half of hanging out with some friends in one call I'm pretty bombastic and go out of the way to do goofy stuff.

Then I'm home, and while I'm by myself I end up digging into me. It's weird; I almost forget about me when I'm around others I know, but then I'm alone and I end up being the only thing I can think about. I get **very** emotional and am really deeply affected by movies and anime or whatnot, and I feel completely different. It's not the worst thing, and I'm very happy to be in tune with experiencing art and how it plays with my feelings, but on the other hand it means I end up like this, looking at parts of myself I don't like.

I know that, in the end, both of these sides of me are me, perhaps, but... I don't know, I just feel almost like I don't know who I am anymore or something, that I don't really understand what I do and don't like anymore, that I'm lying to myself or something. I enjoy discussing my interests more than I do actually doing some of them. I used to be incredibly self-kept, and now I feel this weird need to be super-open about myself... And yet here I am on a throwaway. And what about that? Is there this other side of me I feel like I need to hide? Surely people could figure out my real account anyway. Christ almighty.

The Ancillary Te (problem solving in the most direct efficient way) is certainly my MO, but I've been reading on r/INTP as well as some sites and I really identify with that one a lot.

And well, it confuses me and I don't like to feel confused so I'm trying to sort this out. Anybody else feel this way?

Here is an example of some of the lines from [Personality Page](http://www.personalitypage.com/INTP.html) that I relate to:

&gt;The INTP may be prone to abandoning a project once they have figured it out, moving on to the next thing.

&gt;The INTP is usually very independent, unconventional, and original. They are not likely to place much value on traditional goals such as popularity and security. They usually have complex characters, and may tend to be restless and temperamental. They are strongly ingenious, and have unconventional thought patterns which allows them to analyze ideas in new ways.

&gt;INTPs value knowledge above all else. Their minds are constantly working to generate new theories, or to prove or disprove existing theories. They approach problems and theories with enthusiasm and &gt;skepticism, ignoring existing rules and opinions and defining their own approach to the resolution. They seek patterns and logical explanations for anything that interests them. They're usually extremely bright, and able to be objectively critical in their analysis. They love new ideas

Anyway, there is a lot that I relate to, obviously, but it's mainly how analytical and fact driven I am. I love to understand and to be understood.

Am I the only INFP who feels this way?

Had a lot of stress from school, getting ready for college, and a few personal matters. Combined with the all too familiar idea of having a meaningful college path planned and the feeling of a ""demon inside"" (or basically having an issue or two of either or a serious problem or moral confliction with one's self) really got to me and so I went into a melancholic period. Though I have a pretty good and stable life, I remember at that time feeling desperate to figure out what to do in life. Sometimes I just didn't want to live anymore because I couldn't find that ""purpose"" that we all as infps search for. Of course, both my standard and the standards of those I admired stopped me from exploring that thought futher. But I realize that during that time, I would not only reflect on my negative thoughts, but also try and amplify or draw up new ones. It's like I enjoyed emotionally hurting myself when I was already hurt. I'd do it by listening to depressing music or thinking up of situations that allowed me to emotionally beat myself up and tell myself of how much of a failure I was or show myself what I wanted but couldn't have. I know I cryed a lot secretly at night, mainly when I would bring up bad memories and other negative things on purpose. After getting over that period I returned to normal. I realized though that not too long ago, I just can't bring myself down to that level anymore when doing the things I did to amplify my depressed state. It's like no matter how depressed I try to make myself, I just can't make myself feel bad because of a persistent optimism. I just find it so intriguing.

But then I feel like I'm not experiencing as much of life as I might otherwise, like maybe extroverted people get to live through more circumstances and situations that enable them to grow because they put themselves out there. 
I don't want to stagnate, I want to be on a constant journey of improvement, but I'm always in conflict with that part of me that is comfortable just doing the safe,familiar things I enjoy. A perfect example happened last night. I met up with my boyfriend after a gig of his and we were hanging out, but he wanted to go have dinner with a friend of his who I've met before but who I don't communicate with very well. Part of this is that there is a language barrier, partly that I just don't know him. So I ditched out, I wasn't hungry and didn't savor the notion of making awkward, stilted conversation with a guy I didn't know well. Later I met up with my boy again, and he told me about how it was a really fun time, how a group of his friends, some of which I knew better, had turned up and there was a live band playing music from my region that I had been talking about earlier that day. Afterwords I felt really silly and shy, if I had just made more effort I might have had a really fulfilling night. But I'm often afraid of having to put all that effort in.

1332699522.0,17,self.infp,rcxfo,Having too many interests and hobbies,ThoreauIsCool,18,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/rcxfo/having_too_many_interests_and_hobbies/,"Hi guys. Let me introduce myself - I've considered myself an IN*P for several years and only recently stumbled upon this subreddit. This isn't my main account and I primarily use it for bemoaning my existence on /r/depression but it seems that this subreddit is more in line with the sorts of things that continue to elude me.

I've always had lots of hobbies and interests throughout my life. As a kid, I enjoyed building things and producing artwork, but gradually (as with many) shifted towards computer games as I grew older and am an avid level designer and modder. I also love photography, woodworking and a smattering of other miscellaneous things which make my friends regard me like some sort of weird at-ease retired 60 year old who has too much time to themselves. In high school I wanted to be an architect, before shifting towards artwork and then writing. Now after almost an entire year of college (a liberal arts university), I'm appalled with how narrow-minded and lackadaisical everybody is around here and sincerely wish I were in art school, or learning a trade, or really in any sort of environment with thoughtful individuals that act with a sense of virtue and conviction. I still come home every other week or so, because I really have yet to find any geniunely interesting people around here that simply enjoy talking about philosophy, life at large and working on hobbies. Everybody's too busy partying or yupping it up about pop culture gossip and shallow teen-drama.

That is to say, between my own multifarious background and general apathy towards everybody here, I have virtually no idea what I want to do with my life, to be honest. Sometimes I think that it's futile for me to ever attempt to commit to one particular thing, and often I think I'd be content working any old job so long as it availed me the time and money to allow me to pursue what truly interests me. In school I was always regarded as a bright kid, but now I feel somewhat pathetic as my contemporaries actually acted on their abilities, got girlfriends, went to Ivy Leagues, whilst I've been stretching myself thin trying to accommodate for every opportunity and possibility as to what direction my life may ultimately take, because I'm really indecisive. I feel as though I'm falling behind.

My other weakness is my obsession with the past - historical, fiction, even fantasy. Being any place other than the present. I've always loved the golden age of animation and wished I could live amongst such colorful, lively settings. Then there's the more realistic angle to it. My dad's a baby boomer, so I've grown up on lots of bucolic stories about him spending time on his uncle's farm in the 1950s and what have you. I love everything about the past - whether it's old movies, music, even early color photography. It all has this warmth about it, and whilst I know the past wasn't any more perfect than the present day is, a part of me loves it. Maybe it's because of how people back then were portrayed as so disciplined and moral, yet also going about their lives with this air of determination and competence about them. Certainly a far cry from how I'd describe my life at this point, that's for certain.

I'm not sure what it is, but something about all these places from the past reverberate with me on some deeper level. I often have these romanticized fantasies about living in France during the 1910s or travelling along the Mediterranean during WW2. I'm not sure what it is - whenever I get caught up in one of these fantasies I stop myself and realize that I really possess no idea nor intention as to what I'd be doing there. It's just something about the sense of being there, the atmosphere and sense of adventure/wanderlust or what have you, that I really like.

I've kind of gone off-topic here and I apologize for what is a rather disorganized post (but perhaps this better reflects how disorganized and indescribable I feel about my life sometimes). Basically I was wondering if anybody else here has great difficulty completing projects now and then or committing to particular interests. It's not uncommon for me to fall into an all-encompassing, almost childlike fascination with some new novelty (a new idea for a game; writing) only to lose complete interest a few weeks later. Between that and how uninteresting and unresponsive my collegiate environment has been, I've been stuck in a bit of a rut.

Recently I've been feeling like I've finally drilled down to the 'something' and, instead of the release/ understanding  I was craving, it's just worse.
 
The something: I am not perfect.

I always knew this was a problem for me, but somehow thought something else was underneath it. Everything comes back to this perfection crap.  I shouldn't be angry at other people unless I am blameless. I should never hurt anyones feelings. I shouldn't over-commit (which I always do) but if I don't do something that needs doing I feel guilty. I make a choice and then regret not choosing the other things which are also important. I can't ""just"" do a thing, I always have to invest more time thinking about whether there's a better way to do it and then I am always running late. I give myself crap any time I'm relaxing because there is something I should be doing. I hate doing routine chores but hate it when they're not done.

But now I've added a new dimension- I am giving myself shit for giving myself shit. What the hell? I am self critical for not being able to relax my self-criticism. I am feeling constantly anxious, just want to crawl into bed and pull the covers over my head, but also telling myself that I suck for not realizing I am a good person, and I suck for not just getting over feeling anxious.

1363074696.0,18,self.infp,1a4yii,"From Dexter's Lab: ""What is the purpose of meaning?""",,19,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1a4yii/from_dexters_lab_what_is_the_purpose_of_meaning/,"A year or so ago, an INTJ girl and I were in the fledgling stages of a relationship. On a cartoons-and-cereal date, we watched an episode of Dexter's Lab where he has a nightmare where this question is asked on a test. We decided to each answer the question separately and bring our answers to each other later. Here's what I came up with. I'm wondering if any of you get what I'm going at. 

&gt;Well, if Dexter shit his pants and DeeDee had no trouble answering, then I think it's safe to say that, despite DeeDee's methods on paper, this is not a logical problem. That's good. I was always shit at logic puzzles. 

&gt;The purpose of meaning... The function of the perceived significance or insignificance of a given noun... I say ""function"" rather than ""end"" because it's got less finality than ""end."" End, to me, implies a singular reason to exist, when most things (worthwhile ones, at least) have *at least* one. That, and even though I know what it means, ""the end of meaning"" fucks with my head because ""end"" has multiple meanings itself. Okay, back to the question, hopefully. 

&gt;I think that the function of meaning is to give us some sort of clue as to what is truly important. While something with a very deep meaning is not always important, and some seemingly-superficial things are crucial to our survival, the purpose of meaning is to add additional weight to what could, otherwise, be little more than a lump of inorganic matter. When you see a piece of art, the first question besides ""Why can't I do that?"" is often ""What the hell is that supposed to mean?"" 

&gt;We, as humans, are so caught up in our search for knowledge that we can extrapolate vastly significant messages from things as mundane as the random patterns of paint splatters on an artist's canvas. The purpose of meaning is not recursive (or is it reflexive? Or some other self-referential logicky word), but it's so close that me might as well ask ""Why do we wonder why?"" Because, in my eyes at least, in finding the answer to that question, we will get an answer so close to the answer to this one that all that's required to convert them is a small pocket thesaurus (am I the only one who wished that was a dinosaur as a kid?) 

&gt;I could cop out and say ""to satisfy our innate curiosity,"" but I can't help but think there's more to it than that. Or, maybe I'm just overthinking, as I am wont to do, and the answer is staring me right in the face, as *you* are wont to do (***note: she was. She had big eyes that could bore into your soul***) 

&gt;Maybe the purpose of meaning is to give *us* a sense of purpose, like we didn't just spring up out of the primordial sludge because a randomly-generated jumble of molecules somehow started copying itself. But even those simplest self-replicating proteins, strands of simple RNA or something even more basic, couldn't quite do their jobs perfectly. If we attribute meaning to everything in our lives, it makes us seem less like a vast cosmological coincidence and more like something which, itself, has meaning. 

&gt;Maybe the purpose of meaning is an illusion, a false bottom to the Great Cosmic Junk Drawer, full of useless bits of paper and old bread ties that, try as I might, I just can't bring myself to throw away. ""What if I'm gonna end up needing this later?"" I always ask, as if one day there might come the Bread Tie Apocalypse, the end of fresh-baked goods as we know it, and I will be the only one with the foresight to have saved up a few precious, precious wires covered in paper. 

&gt;The purpose of meaning gives us a purpose of our own, gives us something to work towards to distract us from the unpleasant fact that we are little more than an assembly of chaotically-bonded molecules that evolved a sense of self-importance. Without ""meaning,"" without ""truth,"" we would be no different from the vast clouds of other chaotically-bound molecules drifting through the ether. I may be paraphrasing a bit, but I once heard someone say ""Given enough time, a hydrogen atom will begin to think about itself."" I think that about sums it up. We are the aggregate of billions of years' worth of totally random collisions and explosions and irradiations that, somehow, learned how to question, to desire, to imagine. 

&gt;And I think it's mostly our imaginations that are asking this question, just for something to do while we wile away the seemingly-long hours of the brief span when all of our component molecules agree with one another. Because, without something to strive for, without this nagging insistence that behind every event, there is a reason, an explanation, then we would have to come to terms with the fact that we ourselves have no purpose, no meaning, no function. 


After that, I went on kind of a rant and lost focus. But do you see what I was getting at with my weird style of existentialism? The purpose of meaning is to give us purpose.

Then reading up on INFP, I stumbled across this on oddlydevelopedtypes.com:

""INFPs, like all NFs, have a strong sense of metaphor. This may lead to the anthromorphization of animals or inanimate objects. For example, they may see a fly sitting on the glass and wonder what it is thinking, then come up with a meaningful story about how it feels to be separated from everything you desire by an invisible wall. Or an INFP may feel sorry for an inanimate object, i.e. they may feel secretly feel bad for an old bottle of shampoo that is being heartlessly replaced by the new bottle they just bought.. The metaphorical abilities of the INFPs cause them to see things as alive and possessing feelings--not that they actually believe this, but they cannot help but imagine it. (One wonders how they feel about eating animal crackers.) In fairy tales one often hears of a woman who takes pity on the ants, cat, etc, only to find out that the creature is intelligent and grateful. The stories that INFPs create in their hearts are somewhat similar, though modernism has taken the pleasure out of getting a reward for one's deeds of kindness.""

I feel like an inauthentic asshole every day because I have to ""teach to the test"" and I feel emotionally exhausted all the time. I am a decent teacher and my students and coworkers like me, but I just can't do it anymore.  

I have been on several interviews for non-teaching jobs in the past 4 months, but nothing has come of it. Part of the problem is that I have a masters of teaching, which seems to disqualify me for every other job in this type of economy. In each of my past three interviews, I have been asked, ""Now, *why* would you want to *leave teaching*?"" in the most antagonistic manner and I didn't have any idea how to respond! In one interview, an interviewer commented snidely, ""Wow, you have had a lot of *different* work experiences."" How do y'all deal with interviews? I am at the point where I don't get nervous anymore, but I have a hard time dealing with these two issues in particular when looking for jobs. It also seems like I get interviewed by a lot of SJs.  


Prior to this, like many INFPs, I held an odd assortment of of part-time jobs throughout high school and college. I've never been fired or anything like that--I just seem to get bored and move on, or the position gets cut. I have been working since I was 15, but I've never had a full time position. The job that gave me the most satisfaction was working as an intern at my college's art gallery, but jobs like that are pretty hard to come by these days.  


Are there any INFP teachers or former teachers out there who could give me guidance? I don't know what I want to do as a career and I feel like I never will. I also feel like I will never get a decent job unless I straight-up lie about my work experiences/degrees.

I'm fairly new here, and to see all these people who think similarly to me is...surreal, to say the least. So, I figured, there's no better place to post this.

I can't convince myself to do anything. I graduated from high school last year. I didn't go to college, blaming it on the concussion I suffered during my junior year of high school. The concussion had effects that lasted quite a while: worsening my migraines, colorblindness, and a loss of my passion for football.

Recently, I've been wondering exactly what I plan to do, and I've found the answer is not as simple as I want it to be. I want to be a software programmer, which is difficult when you haven't made a name for yourself. I'm working on this, but obviously, I need money, so my family and my girlfriend are trying to get me to work. My uncle is taking over a business, and has had me help him with several things, from moving lumber to carrying cabinets, among other things. Mostly manual labor, until his business takes off, at which time he will train me to help him.

Here's the thing, though. I don't want to be a cabinet maker, why would I work as/for one? I don't want to disappoint anybody, but the time I would spend making cabinets can be used to write programs. But, since I spend more time thinking about what to do instead of actually doing it, I don't really seem to make much progress on my programs anyway.

I've never been on this subreddit, and after lurking for a bit, I realized that my question is common, but needs a more specialized answer in my case.

I've been dating my INFP boyfriend for 5 months now. We were very good friends for about a year before that. 

We encountered, well frankly, a lot of awkwardness at the beginning of dating. We knew each other well, but the romantic aspect kinda made us retreat into our shells again! Typical introverts :)

Now that it has been some time, he is slowly opening up to me more. We communicate well and maturely. We don't have trouble discussing our relationship and what we want for it.

However, sometimes, I feel like I have to keep asking questions in order for him to definitively say something. 

**Do you guys have trouble verbalizing feelings?** I find no trouble in stating my inner thoughts, feelings, and troubles as they are, but he seems to not be able to explain himself. If he does, he ends up saying, ""Wait, that makes no sense, I'm rambling."" And it's true, what he says ends up being a jumble of words. 

It seems as though when he has time to write a letter, he can get out what he needs to say. But when it's more immediate, he has to be in a certain mindset, or he just gets bewildered.

Basically, I know he loves me, but I cannot tell WHAT it is that he loves about me and us. I'm trying to discern his needs, which is somewhat hard when even he cannot seem to do that! 

Me, on the other hand...I can directly state what I want and need, as well as when I have any problems. He appreciates this, and I'm pretty sure he'd be lost if I wasn't :) 

So basically, how do I figure this out? When I ask, I am met with confused answers. He actually seems to be confused about most things in general, like he's on a constant quest for truth. I'm on a similar quest, but more for understanding/wisdom and knowledge.

**So, INFPs (especially males), can you explain your general thought process to me?** As an INTJ, I need the technical aspect of this :)

1334589336.0,15,self.infp,scgw9,How did you ultimately decide what to do with your life? I don't know whether to focus on art or my writing.,ThoreauIsCool,15,0,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/scgw9/how_did_you_ultimately_decide_what_to_do_with/,"Firstly, I'm sorry if these posts come off as overly wistful or insufficient for sustaining an ongoing conversation. I'm choosing specifically to post to /r/INFP, because from what I've seen of others here I feel as though you guys could perhaps understand that peculiar mix of existentialism and overanalysis of yourself and your motives that has been bothering me.

I'm eighteen years old and have no idea what to do with my life. I've always been attentive enough that I could excel in my schoolwork without effort, and as a consequence of never having to work particularly hard, I've gradually come to the realization that I've never had the opportunity to figure out what truly compels me. I've drifted between a bunch of hobbies and personal projects over the years, but have never really decided what I enjoy the most.

I love fictional worlds - both the writing and artwork that go into them. I've spent a lot of time modding video games and doing level design, but I haven't finished many projects. Usually, I either get caught up in the artwork or in ""world building"" - I'll either enjoy imagining the finished project, with its subtle aesthetics and atmosphere, or get carried away by becoming more enamored with the story and the histories behind it. Kind of like world building for RPGs and D&amp;D campaigns, which is another thing I've done on occasion but never thought much about.

It's also a matter of heartfulness. I have friends who are writers, but I don't share that obsessive, academic bent that they do. I don't discuss the works of great authors, or study theory or practice technique. Hard to say if that implies more or less passion - it could go either way. On one hand, writing comes very naturally to me and it can be quite difficult to restrain myself from getting caught up in lengthy diatribes and fanciful short stories. On the other, I don't go crazy over the prospect of having to write. A part of me thinks I may only write to impress people - my artwork is the opposite. It's entirely for myself, and I've seldom felt any compulsion to seek praise from others for it. But I'd have to spend more time developing it.

Perhaps I'm simply over/undervaluing it. I know one needn't try and incorporate everything they're good at into their daily life, but at this point in my life I'm so tired and don't know if I have the patience to learn something else from the beginning. Some have told me that I'm too quick to drop all progress once I become adequate at something.

I have very little foundation in conventional art. I'd consider myself better at it than the average person, but that isn't saying much. But at the same time, I possess this sensitivity to artwork that I feel many don't have. I can become captivated by mundane everyday details and scenery. Photographs, the painted backgrounds of old cartoons and adventure games - they've this air of character about them, and evoke in me a certain, indescribable sense of almost melancholic longing about the way things used to be and always ought to have been. There's a certain majesty to be felt in the sheer face of the adventure, and the resolve of the characters who move about in them. I want to live among these worlds. They speak to me more powerfully than anything in real life does.

I don't know what I'd enjoy studying more in the long term. I've never really received formal schooling in either, and I can do particular things (art: texture design, landscape paintings; writing: academic papers, articles) but few others. I feel more like a craftsperson who has focused on a few specific aspects of these things that interest him, rather than an educated individual who could develop basic ability in any direction. Which is problematic for the wroking world and all that, as you can imagine.

I feel as though writing can always be done on the side - and art is the only ""honest"" thing for me to study. But for all I know, I'll share the opposite sentiment next week.

Sometimes I think maybe I'm just overanalyzing myself. But I've been growing increasingly disinterested in school and withdrawing more into my own projects - few of my friends can relate to this, and those who do aren't in artistic fields so I get little in the way of feedback from others. I'm not asking for people here to plan out my entire life for me, but I feel as though those on /r/INFP may best relate to my scattered and confused way of looking at things.

I originally posted this in the r/Introvert subreddit, but I think this definitely belongs here too.

I would never imagine myself peddling movie trailers or recommending anything as far as advertising, but I don't think I've seen a movie trailer where I could relate to the main character so much. I probably don't need to go into a lot of detail

This is the trailer I fell in love with and can't wait to see this movie when it comes out. The newest adaptation of James Thurber's story stars Ben Stiller and comes out on Xmas 2013:

For fun (and all you classic movie buffs), here's the trailer to the 1947 version: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntATWJl6Yl0

But comparing it to the short story, I think both versions took a lot of liberty of creating something new from the original:

http://bnrg.eecs.berkeley.edu/~randy/mitty.html

I feel like the Stiller version does a better job of showing the effortless transition from real world to inner mind better than the older version, but that could just be from how filmmaking has changed so much. Plus, I just love the way the newest film looks, more like a piece of art that tells a great story.

My best friend in the whole wide world is an INFP (I made him take a test). I want to know how he's feeling because he doesn't talk much about himself (Fi). No drama or anything, just a few questions. 


Me and him met high school. I can't recall exactly how I met him but we weren't particularly close in high school, just decent friends with a few common hobbies. Our social circles intersected a LOT - even now I share close to half of my friends with him. When I was a senior, I would give him rides home pretty often so I started to get to know him a lot more, but it was still arms distance from what I recall.

After high school, we got a lot closer. I started talking to him almost every day online. I moved away for college, but the breaks were frequent and the summers long. I started spending time alone with him, we'd climb and just talk all day. Go to the beach and talk. Go to a hill and talk. I found I agreed with him on almost every major view from politics to philosophy to religion to you name it. 

I think one of the key turning points was when I came out to him over the internet. The moment is etched permanently into my memory. He was the first person I told and it was a year before I came out to anyone else. He was so important in my life that I couldn't bear to have him not see the *true me*. In the days prior I was thinking about it constantly in my head, filled with the feeling that every moment I didn't tell him was another moment I wasn't being true to him, was being false, etc. I had typed out the sentence (""I want to tell you I'm gay"" or something) and sat there for probably forty minutes just too nervous to hit enter. I hit enter and literally ran away from my computer because I was afraid of what he would say. In the end he warmly accepted me like I knew he would. 

Somewhere around here I started crushing on him pretty hard like gay people tend to with straight people. I don't know what it is, because in my head I knew he was straight, but it started tainting our relationship. I started saying stupid things and would hang on every word he said online (luckily he couldn't sense it through the Internet?). I never crossed the line and never hit on him or anything, but he probably knew. Eventually I got over him but not before some pretty awkward moments. 

It's now a few years out of high school and we are closer than ever. I've learned so much from him. He probably kindled a kind of deep-seated spirituality in me. He understands me better than I understand myself. I've never met someone with as much depth and empathy as him. He just seems so much more ""real"" than anyone else. I rely on him a lot for emotional support. To be *seen* by him just feels so ... right. 

This feeling of being completely and perfectly understood is so strong that I wish everyone, not the least of which him, could feel it and that I could give it. He almost never talks about his own feelings. I think it's because Fi is introverted. I used to think our friendship was imbalanced, and this really used to weigh heavily on me. I felt that he didn't really get much out of our friendship, but I've been instructed otherwise. Am I really that thick? Whatever I give him - my ideas? my confidence? - he has told me as such that it really is equal. I guess whatever he ""gets"" out of our relationship I must give without even thinking. Is it the same for you guys? 

It seems that just as my intuitions (Ni) are reserved and I wouldn't feel comfortable talking about them, so too are his feelings (Fi). I find that I'm much more willing (paragraphs prior being good evidence) to express themselves on the Internet so I'm asking you, resident INFPs. What are your thoughts (or feelings)? What do you value in a friendship like this? Building on what [others](http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1eax5f/lets_talk_about_best_friends_infp/c9yl9sz) have [said](http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1eax5f/lets_talk_about_best_friends_infp/c9yrm5c), what is it like from your perspective?

I was born late into my family. I'm 21 and all my siblings are in their 30s and early 40s. So I was raised without them in my life. As a result I only really feel close to my Mother who raised me, and I do that typical INFP thing where I feel like no body else in my family really 'gets' me. Also I'm really quick to cut siblings out of my life if there's any kind of friction between us.

I don't really like the way I act with my family. But I can't help it. I wanna be involved and supportive and enjoy their company, but I just don't. I really have a tough time relating to them and I feel like they can be a little condescending towards me a lot of the time (I'm viewed as the 'brain' in the family, and that's kind of it. I don't have much of an identity with them outside of that. If I start talking about a subject I'm passionate about they just laugh and think I'm being goofy or over-thinking or something. It's really frustrating.) 

Seeing as I was born so late into my family and my siblings and I don't really have much in common, how am I supposed to act? Does my position as brother change from the traditional position?

INFP-""the martyr""- This type tends to sacrifice themselves in an effort to promote their peculiar sense of truth.

INPF-""jesus christ""-Like a more refined version of ""the martyr,"" this type tends to turn their very identity into a metaphor for the truth they promote.

IFNP-""cat hotel""-This isolation-prone subtype tends to idealize simplicity and a-rationality.

IFPN-""the hoarder""- A combination of strong sensory and feeling preference makes this type prone to collecting various objects to symbolize emotional states and periods in time.

IPFN-""bathtime""-The combination of a highly fluid identity and relative sensory preference in this type means they like an inordinate quantity of alone time.

IPNF-""commonlaw""-Stasis and apathy tends to overwhelm this subtype. Often mistaken for an INTP.

N-type- ""the manipulators""

NIPF-""master of puppets""- This type is very adept at creating concord or discord, without appearing involved. Its motives remain inscrutable. Of the INFPs who are mistaken for INTPs, this is the most dangerous.

NIFP-""guilt trip""- Much like the NIPF, but with a strong sense of right and wrong, this subtype can always intuit the motives of others.

NFIP-""journey of shame""-This subtype is like a more extraverted ""guilt trip"", and uses this power to make large groups of people feel bad.

NFPI- ""performance artist""-This type almost always manifests as a ""journey of shame"" gone too far. They usually only succeed in making other people uncomfortable.

NPFI-""the zen seminar disruptor""-A bit like an F version of their NPTI cousins, they want to mediate, but tend to rely on the single answer ""we're all one, maaaan.""

NPIF-""the zookeeper""-Eerily close to their NPIT counterparts, this type collects personalities into elaborate menageries of potential. Also called the ""animal hoarder""

P-type-""the daydreamers""

PINF-""The false INTP""-With a strong feeling about the possibilities for their identity, these types choose the type that fits their feelings about themselves the best, the INTP.

PIFN- ""The angry aesthete""- Tying their identity to art, this type is angry about the very existence of art of low quality. Unfortunately, they're usually right.

PFIN-""Elliot Smith""-This type dominates the group of INFPs that are most likely to become poets and songwriters.

PFNI-""Stevie Nicks""-More extraverted than PFINs, this type will usually rely on help from others to promote their agenda, whatever that may be. Lucky for us, it's usually artistic.

PNFI-""Totorro""- This type knows that the possibility for dreamy cuddles is endless. Just don't piss it off.

PNIF-""Bukowski""-I told you not to piss Totorro off. 

F-type-""the nurturers""

FINP- ""the moralist""- The SJ of the INFP universe, this subtype carries a very robust moral code and is not shy about expressing it.

FIPN-""the veterinarian""- Healers in every sense of the word, these are like the FINP, but they tend to focus on the physical body of the ""patient"" first.

FNIP-""snuggie""- This type is always trying to find simple solutions to the emotional turmoil in people's lives. Once they find the solution, they try to apply it wherever possible.

FNPI-""cuddle puddle""-This nurturer tends to use its very personality as an emotional ointment for the troubles of their subject.

FPIN-""fursuit""- This subtype is preoccupied with the possibilities for refined emotions. This can lead it to a variety of novel solutions for self- and group-expression.

FPNI-""care bear""- A less refined version of the ""fursuit,"" this type tries to craft novel emotional solutions for each separate relationship.

That being said, did anybody else, before realizing they were INFP's, feel a particular attachment towards any artists who also happened to be an INFP? I ask this because, being a lover of both literature and music, most of the time I feel as if the only people I can ever truly relate with are my favorite authors (Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Albert Camus) and my favorite musicians (Jonsi of Sigur Ros, Ian Curtis of Joy Division, etc.). 

I've felt a sort of almost supernatural connection with all of my favorite artists because I knew that they had expressed fully those wild, chaotic feelings that flew about inside me that I could only dream of taming. Their sincerity with their emotions struck all the right chords within me, and for once I felt like someone out there just ""got it"". They felt like long-lost brothers and sisters to me, and when other people failed me or disappointed me, i'd always look to them for words of wisdom, guidance, and reassurance that I wasn't going insane, or at the very least, that I wasn't the first to go insane. 

Now that I know that most of my very favorite artists are indeed INFP's it all makes a lot of sense that I naturally gravitate towards them. And now that I know that INFP's run rare in society (often being the antithesis of society's ideal) and that I know nobody else who is one, it makes me feel reassured that I really wasn't being crazy when I said that I only really felt ""at home"" when I read the works of Virginia Woolf or James Joyce or when I listened to Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division or Agaetis Byrjun by Sigur Ros.

It's wonderful that I can find a subreddit for anything I can think of. I'm reading the posts here and it's just making me smile ear to ear, I love the way you all think. I am very firmly in the INTJ category, although in my earlier life I would have identified more with the INFP archetype myself. I guess I should try and get to the point, though.

I've been friends with an INFP girl for a year, and she's changed my life entirely. She taught me the value of being kind. She taught me how to feel. She taught me how to love, even. There would be so many times when I would just be railing off about the people in my life that annoy me, and something she would say would cause me to realize I was being an arrogant ass. I've learned to open up because of her, and I've learned how to accept people unconditionally, just like she does. She taught me that I need to consider people while I'm running my endless experiments and understand that I can hurt them if I'm not careful.

Due to romantic complications that were entirely my fault, I don't have her around to talk to anymore :(. I might in the future, but for now I am quite sure it is best if I leave her alone. It hurts, but on another level, even the hurting makes me realize my heart isn't of stone after all. She always made me feel warm and accepted, even when I was stressed out and being a huge jerk. I will forever be a better person because of her influence.

I want to know more people who can always see the bright side of things, and are willing to let me go on about the things that fascinate me. I guess I'm asking if any of you would like to chat, play a game, or something similar. I'm looking to make friends with warm, kind people so I don't have to put my barriers back up. :)

Also, we are planning on meeting up on the 5th for a casual hangout session in town, what is a good idea for a day's worth of activities that doesn't necessarily scream ""date"", which may scare her away?

As I'm sure none of you are aware, there is a Minecraft Server for INTPs (/r/INTPcraft). It's been going on for about 2.5 months and has been fairly active. /u/nostalgicBadger, the creator, is starting a new server based on the full spectrum of myer-briggs aptly named MBTIcraft.

This server isn't a typical Minecraft server ('vanilla'), as there have been a few modifications made to it. The biggest and most important change is the addition of groups. That's right, you can play with all your INFP buddies! Keeping this in mind, /u/C4Redalert and I have spent roughly a week designing a Central City to accommodate the different 'factions'. The use of this city is completely optional (go off and make your own city... with blackjack! and hookers!), but the coolest thing about this city is that each faction has its own district within the city walls and only that faction can build there. I'm looking forward to seeing how each town differs, but that's just me. 

If you're not too keen on sharing a world with everyone, you can travel to a private world where only your faction can build. People might stop by to take a gander, but you don't have to worry about them touching your stuff. Chase them away with a stick or something! We will also be featuring a currency system as well as shop/lodging rentals. They are features that we hope will help encourage an economy and immersive sense of together-ness, but your experience will not be hindered if you choose not to use them; your experience is what you make of it. 

We're not open just yet, but we will be in a week (Friday, 10th@8PM EST) . We do have a subreddit open, /r/mbticraft, and /u/nostalgicBadger has a full-fledged website in the works so that we might be able to get our personalitycafe brethren on-board. Please do subscribe, equip some flair, and get ready to rep your type.

I'll try to answer any questions you might have for awhile, but it is a friday... so...

[EDIT: ...or not...!] He's been burned badly - badly - twice, once from a 20-year marriage, and then from the ""rebound"" girlfriend who preceded me. He's a child of divorce, and also had the unfortunate experience of finding out as a young man that his father was not actually his father. So there's rejection to spare, in the past.

In so many ways, he's true to the INFP archetype - questing for meaning in his life, a bit reserved about his emotions but by no means ""cold"", considerate, flexible and laid-back, a bit self-deprecating. (OK, maybe secretly a lot. He comes off as slightly self-deprecating but in some ways he's very inwardly hard on himself.)

I'm an INTP [female - yeah, we're rare], but unlike my archetype, I'm pretty in touch with my feelings. I don't like playing games, and he professes the same. I went out on a limb and have made my feelings known by saying ""I love you,"" without an expectation that he would necessarily reciprocate.

And yet here I am, wondering if and when he might confess the same. Actually, he's said to me that he's scared - he's been hurt so badly. I understand. I'd like to think I'm patient. And yet... I feel like I'm out there, all vulnerable, by myself. And it's a little scary and lonely, not knowing for sure where I stand.

Sometimes during a moment of closeness, the eye contact is so intimate and deliberate, and I *think* it's a deep and meaningful, soulful gaze. I *think* this is his way of saying ""I love you"" without saying it. He's a passionate and considerate lover... so giving... and yet not overly demonstrative with the physical affection outside of the bedroom, though we hold hands occasionally in public, or he will sometimes put his arm around me.

I'm trying so hard - so hard! - not to be clingy or overwhelming. But by nature of being an INTP, I find that I want and need a little more definition, if only to be sure that what I *think* is happening... is *actually* happening - that my perception matches reality.

This document shall serve as a summary of my current mental state of being sixteen years old. I already gave you the tl;dr, so if you do not feel like reading any further, the door is this way: -----&gt;

You may ask: why are you making this public? Well... I always believed in openness. I don't have many things to hide, and my problems are not one of them... We are all human. We all have problems.

I... Don't know where to start. I never really could find any means of contact with my peers. They have delight in stupid jokes and fighting teachers... I like teachers. Often, outside of classes, they have wisdom and experience, which is very valuable.

I feel lonely. I am ambivalent, but not in a way that I am comfortable with either solitude or groups... I enjoy the company of one, two people most.

I am a heavy individualist. I often have different opinions than ""the group"". I get annoyed often, as my class also does and it gets easy to get into a flamewar. Cultural discussion sparks cultural discussion in me, raging and stupidity sparks being... Pissed off.

I'm also a programmer, trying to learn art and to run a blog, but it is not an easy feat - you'll see why below. The problems are related to every one of these, as well as my general life...

What do I want? Development, development, exploring the world perhaps? But not in an adventurer sense... I want to learn art, improve my coding, writing... It would make for a lot of useful and practical skills.

But! (Note: The order is quite random)

* I am very lazy. Insanely so... It's procrastination. Few people care about my opinion. School and nurture has ruined my ability to gratify myself for good work, a spoiled life made me unable to work hard for a better return, internet made me desire being instantly gratified.
* I am jealous. Of people who have spent less - or more - effort into creating something wonderful. Of people whose ideas are beautiful. Of people who do things I can't... Jealousy has killed my soul.
* I don't feel creative. Although I have a lot of ideas, they're either really niche or plain generic. I can't innovate, merely iterate... Or can I? Is there a way to find out?
* I lack IRL companions. I have a few, but they either don't understand me or never have time. It's painful.
* I get annoyed very easily. It causes mental pain in the long run.
* I am most productive in the morning times. But I'm stuck in school then. Evenings are when I get lazy, by habit.
* My brain is a habitual pessimist. I am used to seeing the worst possible turn of events, even if it is surreal. It's bad. Really bad. It makes me fear things and stops me from trying new things as I fear I will lose my sanity or time or whatnot
* I cannot easily pick ideas. I keep thinking which one is a better effort to spend my valuable time on.
* I overthink. I desire being able to just do. Create. Play. Have fun. Overthinking made me lose my enjoyment of things.
* I cannot form habits and I forget things. It takes weeks of reminder in order to finally do something other people want me to. For myself, it's a matter of dropping out at the first day of break... and never coming back. I just cant get myself to. It feels like an infinitely lasting block on any project I undertake.
* I want to try a lot of new things but don't do any. I feared failing, but I solved that. Now I just fear wasting time. And when I don't, I feel unable to just get myself to start. Really. I keep saying I'll do it now for hours.
* I daydream too much. It causes that I see the big picture as really well-defined, get time to develop ideas and interfaces, but sering all those finished projects in my head demotivates me a lot, despite attempts to focus on the small steps, because i keep seeing how much work is left.
* Most of my ideas are large. The small ones are usually already done.
* I never felt hard work turn out awesome. Therefore, my brain is completely unadjusted to it and never really felt great after spending a long time on something.
* Cannot gratify myself, have to rely on others. Thank you, educational system!

UPDATE after discussing it with others:

* Self-doubt. Yeah.
* I am impatient. Due to my innate skills of collecting information I never had to work hard. And I need to research, or clean up code, or spend hours practicing art, to get anywhere. It sucks.

UPDATE 2:

I was bullied for a long time in primary school (which lasts 6 years, then we have 3 of secondary and 3 of... tertiary? idk, Polish education)... that and the internet made me become colder than I wish I were. I was VERY empathetic in primary, like, literally.

* I want my empathy back, by any means possible or acceptable. I **hate** my emotional coldness and it's one of the things that makes me feel like I'm not truly myself.
* I want to run a community. Sadly, EVERY place I'm active in already has at least a dozen.
* I'm not responsible enough. As I said, I forget things, I also jump to other activities too quickly which is related to my procrastination and other things mentioned above.

UPDATE 3:

* Poor time management.

UPDATE 4:

* I seek someone to appreciate what I do. It's hard.

UPDATE 5:

* I am jealous of other people's successes and ideas. Heavily.

What I seek is solutions. Solutions to my problems. I know this document means any future employer will never hire me. They will find it somehow. But I do not care. Honesty is more important than societal ways of living a life.

PS. Workarounds are also fine. I know some of these problems will pass with age, but I want to find a workaround so that I don't waste those valuable years of my life.

All the while, the person becomes very negative about their outlook on everything. That's the theory anyway. (I suggest you listen to *The Stranger* by Billy Joel, very relevant.)  
So today I was ultra depressed in the morning and I acted/thought like a textbook INFP. I tend to be a very stressed person. Later however, I did a lot of exercising, endorphins were released, and I was happy. I began talking with my family more instead of staying alone in my room, I stopped focusing on weird concepts, started thinking objectively, actually did some of my chores for once, and had planned my day out.  
So basically, instead of being the regular negative INFP I usually am, I was a happy ESTJ. I was at least exhibiting those sorts of behaviors.  
I have also noticed that both myself and others on this subreddit tend to be unhappy, stressed, and or depressed.  
So what if (big if), we (the stressed ones, not you normal-folk) are all ESTJ's under constant stress that have artificially acted like INFP's and we have no damn clue?

That’s a question that I don’t think a lot of people really consider and spend their precious time agonizing over. They may, I’m not them. I could never understand them, just like they’ll never understand me. Although in the real world they get to be the ‘us’ and I get to be the ‘them’. 

I’ve always felt detached from the us, I’ve never felt I was in on the consensus. It seemed like back when I was still a child the us was preoccupied with sex and booze and whatever the next ‘thing’ was that they could exhaust. I watched them, like I would watch a television show or a play, as all of them filtered about in the world acting according to their character. I could see their strengths and their flaws and watch those attributes define their existence. I wonder if they could see those as well. I wonder if they thought about who they were. I could never understand them.

I always knew I was different. They made fun of me for it, they did, they did. How could someone not chase the same things and pine after the same goals? How could someone understand the world in such a way as to not choose a side on things? How could someone stay wrapped in their own thought so long? They’ll never understand me.

Was I the only one who saw the world for what it was? Why was I the only one trying to fix it? What did I comprehend that which everyone else missed? Why were the masses of people I met part of the us, and I not once found someone who was part of the them? I didn’t think it was possible that they knew what I knew. If the us thought like me this world would be such a better place. I don’t mean that in some sort of delusional pride, truly, for I know better than anyone that my faults are too many to name. But if the us thought like me, could they look at the homeless man and claim he deserved it because he didn’t work hard enough? Could they support a war against people for the simple reason that they don’t look like the us? Could they still turn the other way as greedy businessmen and power-hungry politicians teamed up to pervert the foundations of society to suit their own selfishness? 

I only feel peace on a rainy day. I only know happiness when wrongs are righted. I only attach to people who can at least call themselves members of the them. On some days I dream of being an incendiary revolutionary, torching the plagues afflicting civilization until we can finally be proud of the world around us. On others I dream of sitting in a wood completely isolated from that civilization with only my notebook, pen, and thoughts to keep me company. I’m torn between these two, between fixing the world and forgetting it.

Who am I? On which side does my soul feel more at peace resting? How do I feel about myself? Are my thoughts a blessing or a curse?
 
Yes, there are the downsides, but I wouldn’t trade the thoughts I think for anything. I love this world I live in. I am amazed, every day, at the beauty at it all. I have been granted the ability to see this beauty, to understand it, to protect it. That is why it is my dearest personal mission to expose that beauty, to force the us to see what I see. It may be my secret, but it should be the beauty for all to behold. That is my mission, that is my dream – to give the gift of the beauty of the world to my fellow man. Maybe someday the us will understand, maybe someday I’ll find a girl who wants to join me on this walk. I don’t know whether I’ll succeed, but I do know I can endeavor to. This life is a strange journey we walk, and despite everything else I know the journey set before me. I know who I am. I’m a dreamer.

Living with SJ's parents has been pretty rough. All they ever wanted for me was to get good grades, go to a good college, get a good job, and just be a normal person. Anything slightly eccentric, creative, or imaginative would be met with criticism and punishment. They set expectations which instead of motivating me made me feel incompetent, further decreasing any drive I had. 

My dad tried to beat every last drop of emotion out of me by completely invalidating any feelings i tried to express to him and yelling at me when I cried. He basically taught me that feeling = weakness, and being a Fi dominant personality, you can imagine where this took my self esteem.

My mom on the other hand was ruled by anxiety and fear. She was extremely overprotective, carefully watching over every move I made and giving me almost no freedom. She was the kind of mom who basically saw me as a pet to take care of with no freedom of my own. She made me go to church with her every week and put me in a private christian high school, leaving all my friends. Being a feeler, she did at least catch on that I was unhappy and needed help but the only solace she could give me was ""God has a way of working things out"" and sending me to a christian therapist.

From a very young age, I would look around at my friends' parents and how they interacted and wonder why I couldn't have that same kind of relationship. I felt like I couldn't talk about anything meaningful without getting judged, my parents only seemed to be interested in small talk, so I just stayed quiet around them. This eventually developed into social anxiety, making it difficult to talk to anyone without fear of being judged or thought less of. 

For a long time I had despised my parents, I blamed them for turning me into a social recluse in a vicious cycle of self-pity. But after a while I think I've forgiven them. Being angry at them for being unable to understand me is no different than them being angry at me for not conforming. Something the MBTI has helped me come to terms with is that us INFPs are complex feelers and its unfair to expect everyone to understand us. I know deep down they do love me, our types were just completely incompatible. 

I apologize if this sounds like a lot of complaining. There are probably many of you out there with worse situations who would love to be in mine. I'm only 19 and I'm still trying to make sense of this whole thing, but I just thought I'd share because I needed to vent and don't know where else to.

I realize testing online isn't an official diagnosis, so I take it with a grain of salt. I might just be ""lucky"" enough to be an INFP with a form of high-functioning autism but I feel like there might be a lot of shared characteristics. Correct me if I'm wrong. I suppose I'll just talk about certain characteristics that I've noticed in myself and other INFPs here that also go with Asperger's.

I find it difficult to articulate what I'm thinking or trying to say unless I write it down. Speech isn't my strongest suit. Which seems to me to be both an AS and INFP characteristic. A lot of people with AS also have a very big vocabulary.

&gt; The conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide context for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts.

We love to talk about things that interest us, as INFPs, and we love to talk about our internal feelings, I've noticed.

Have questions.,El_Legions,15,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/infp/comments/1he009/hello_all_21m_infp_fairly_new_to_reddit_have/,"Hello, subreddit! 21 years, male - I'm doing college right now... I feel like it's going too slow. My sister said I should take my time, but then I feel like everyone is graduating way ahead of me. I'm also absurdly anxious about finding a job and a ""proper"" place in the world. 

I'm a pretty solid INFP, even during my most social phases. We had a class in high school that taught us leadership skills, and one of the things we had to learn were these personality traits and how to work with/manipulate them. I don't really like manipulation. Every now and then I check if I'm the same. I am.

Lately, I've been more and more suspicious of myself, namely ""Am I turning crazy?"" I feel like the more I learn about anything- especially current events-...I don't know; I just feel like I'm getting more and more paranoid. 

I'm a good social chameleon. I have to be. It's (hopefully) going to be my job sooner than later. I can talk the way a certain circle of friends do... fratsters, gangstas, etc. but then I find that I lose my own identity, because I don't really speak the way *I* do unless I'm around people I trust (my closest friends). I may be afraid of who I am around people I don't know, and this leads into confidence issues around women and a plethora of other shitty things.  

I'm constantly wondering if I'm doing the right thing. I constantly guilt myself for living off of my parents. They're from another country because of a war so I'm first generation. They did a lot to get here and I don't feel like I deserve it. I didn't make it into the UC and just go to a shitty state school and I feel like a disappointment. And I'm a musician instead of whatever safe, well paying job I could be trying to get. I can't really communicate with them because there's a language barrier as well as a social barrier. Then that leads into this precarious balance of doing what I want and what is the best for the family... That's another thing. I feel like a horrible son because I never go back and talk or visit. But the thing is, my parents and I never talked, or anything. I don't think we know how to approach each other. I've always been envious of my friends who have great friendships with their parents. 

I'm very grateful for what I have, though. 

TL;DR - I have no idea what I'm doing, and I can't confide in my parents, let alone myself. I'm losing myself no matter what I try. I don't even know how to TL;DR this shit.

I built up walls and closed the doors

You always knew what beneath our floors

I did not hear and would not listen

An important lesson I was given

You brought me truth I disregarded

I couldn't see what had been started

You made your point and stood outside

I chose to lock myself inside

To be followed is what you wanted

Fix the errors that we had planted

From inside the house was pure

Was all so sweet and demure

Cozy safe and secure

On the out it was all thorns

As if everything had been torn

Pieces placed with no real plan

Forever on the shifting sand

Peering out from our window

On the ground you cast a shadow

Come stand outside you would say

Enjoy the bright and sunny day

The ground was shifting and you stood free

Well aware you tried to help me

All your effort to no avail

I was shocked when it failed

How could this be I sat and wondered

It was so strong and well supported

Standing there in your hand

I have trouble getting myself to actually move forward in my life. I have spent far too long planning out the details of my life and have, with great regret, not done anything of real value. 

My mother and step-father believe that I'm just a *lazy bum* but the truth is that I'm afraid of not achieving the things I set myself to do. (I've always been a perfectionist and it's been my downfall at times, which is especially true in this matter. In fact I've spent more time trying to get this post as perfect as possible than I'd like to admit...) 

I'm very much introverted. I've been trying to express myself more to my family but it still proves difficult. Relations with my parents have been rocky, trying to fix it has been a mess of itself. Trying to get them to understand me now is even more difficult. Finding someone that understands how I feel, seems to be nigh impossible in real life.

I feel overwhelmed with all these new responsibilities and choices. I want to have more time to think things through and plan things, but I don't have time anymore.  I need to head out and start my own life now, go to college...etc...

I've felt depressed for some time now. I've tried to get some help with therapists and the sort before but never could share what really made me feel the way I do. So it never helped me. I've gotten better as of late but still feel alone and the like from time to time. 

I know I need to get my life moving but I'm just so unsure of everything now. I feel lost and vulnerable. I absolutely DREAD it. I need to know more things about what has to be done and so on. I just hate not knowing what to do or how to deal with things. 

I'm currently living alone but close-by to my mother and step-father. My father lives states away and I get called every week...although like that post about answering phones... Let's just say that I don't always pick up. Idk why I feel so afraid to pick it up. Even knowing it's my dad.

Sorry for the wall of text, this is my first time posting here. I just wanted to share a small thing that helps me ""get out of my head"" (so to speak) when it comes to new social situations. 

Often, I find myself being incredibly self-critical or blaming when it comes to getting to know new people (this is especially true if I'm texting/IMing). I get caught up in picking the right words and timing things just right, and if things don't happen as I expect them to, I blame myself: *""Oh, that was probably a weird thing to say""*; *""You don't know them well enough to say something like that yet, you've probably offended them""*, etc. When things like this happen, I have to remind myself that not everyone thinks the same way I do; not everyone analyzes word choice like I do; not everyone is self-effacing/self-deprecating like I am, and so on and on and on. 

Even when I'm on the receiving end, if someone takes too long to text back, I start pouring over what I sent to them for mistakes I might've made, when it's probably something simple like, they put down their phone and forgot.

Until recently I have been battling with myself in an attempt to discover why I am different than everyone else. Why I seem so much more paranoid, why I care so much about what people thing (criticism). I never understood why I didn't care as much about having high dollar clothes, or why having a boyfriend/dating ""the"" guy wasn't one of my goals in highschool. I never thought about playing sports, never crossed my mind to suck up to the teacher, do drugs, drink or even attempt to make friends. I did what I needed to do on a daily basis, and kept to myself. It didn't hit me until after I graduated and completed a couple years of college that I was internally different, not physically. Before, I thought all of my shyness was due to me being overweight, so in 2 years I lost 75 pounds and gained a new level of confidence. 
This confidence did me very little good when I still didn't understand who I was inside. I lost all of that weight to ""look"" like society, hoping that the charm, the charisma and the social dominance would naturally come with it. Sadly, I was mistaken.
After realizing that it was my personality to be introverted, to keep to myself, to think and react on intuition, to jump to conclusions, to ""profile"" people, to overanalyze and over criticize, I fell down a deep slope of depression.
I thought there was no point to life, if I was going to be so uncomfortable in public situations, if I was going to make small criticisms into huge cluterfucks of drama and most importantly, if I wasn't going to be able to make AND KEEP any friends...
In this time I also lost my job as somewhat of a Personal Assistant due to my depression and sudden lack of ability to mask my emotional distress at work.
Sooo, I am unemployed, at home and trying to figure out why the hell I can't fit it.

So I open up Google and start searching.

Eventually I found and completed a couple tests to see what personality type I was and what my ""ego"" is, I quickly realized that the world is full of people like me, and I indeed have a gift. A gift of intuition. An ability to imagine, create and appreciate. A gift to plan, prepare, examine and blend in. 

But now, my biggest problem is triggering one of my biggest stress factors/fears.
What am I going to do for the rest of my life?!

and that is how I ended up here. I did a little more searching, found this place, and now I am on the hunt to find more people like me and see what they ended up doing.
Maybe it'll settle my restlessness tonight.
Maybe.


Just wanted to say hey, and thanks. Knowing there are more people out there like me, makes me feel better than I have in years.

I'm in my mid-twenties and have been experiencing some anger-related emotional changes these past 2-3 years. Growing up I was always very quiet, withdrawn, calm, etc. I didn't get riled up easily. I could be very mean, but it was in a quiet, cuts-you-to-the-core-emotionally mean type of way. I grew out of it (thankfully), and am now in a much better, kinder, place. I help people live healthier, happier lives for a living and I love it. I'm generally able to see the positive in any situation, and am inspired by the people I meet who often have bigger problems than I and also sunnier attitudes.

Lately, though, I've begun to experience bouts of extreme anger. It started maybe 2-3 years ago. This wave of rage will wash over me, and I want to scream and throw and smash things into oblivion. Before this started I don't think I'd ever seriously yelled at anyone (except that one old guy who almost ran me over with his car while I was biking), and I'd certainly never smashed something in a fit of rage. If I get into a fight with my partner, I'm likely to punch the wall, slam a door, or stomp/jump repeatedly so the whole house shakes.  

That amount of anger feels really out of character for me. I'm wondering how other INFPs deal with and experience anger, since it wasn't an emotion that came up much for me during my childhood and adolescence. Deep breathing and forcing myself to calm down does help after a while, but I'm always left wondering if I've moved past the anger or if I'm just repressing it, waiting for it to come out again later. 

How do you experience anger?

How do you deal with it?

I understand (for the most part) the cognitive functions and everything. But I still end up feeling like I switch between INTP and INFP. Ultimately, I know it's not a box that I need to stuff myself into, though.

Anyway, I seem to be a mix of both, but I'd like to sort out the confusion just for the sake of it. Perhaps this lends itself to Ti, but there is equal evidence that my Fi is incredibly strong.

I just don't seem to have the ""dreamy"" aspect that most INFPs tend to give off. I associate INFP with ""sugar, flowers, rainbows, unicorns"" (think [Meet the Pyro in his ""candy land""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUhOnX8qt3I)) and this fanciful and child-like fantasy attitude. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not really my kind of thing. Maybe it's selection bias, though.

What I *can* relate to with INFPs is my sense of ethics and morality. I'm interested in philosophy and self-growth. I place greater value on certain things that others don't. I get strong feelings about things, but don't always speak up about them.

There are times where I have an opportunity to say something really sentimental or emotional, but I hold back in fear of being ""too over the top."" For instance, I'll be thinking about how strongly I appreciate the friendships I have, but I feel like it would be too awkward to say, ""Hey, guy, I'm glad we're friends."" Basically, I'm afraid to show my sensitive side to anyone except a very select few. I consider myself really ""feely and caring"" for being a guy (in an oft-times ""alpha-male"" oriented society).

Perhaps this is an INTP issue (inferior Fe?). I also have difficulty with organization (inferior Te?).

On the INTP side, I tend to be very analytic. I think things over and over and over. I sometimes notice small differences that others don't. I like geeky/""INTP"" topics.

I tend to test for INTP on the HumanMetrics test, and INFP on CognitiveQuiz.

Anyway, I feel like I've written enough and I know it's a long read so thank you for reading this far.

TL;DR: Confused about whether I'm INTP or INFP. Test as both, Ti and Fi feel equal, not sure about how the inferior function affects things.

It feels awesome to be able to tell someone to fuck off, when they are trying to pressure you into doing something you don't wish to do. It helped me realize that I should have more fun with myself, and stop taking life so damn serious. 

  Another area of my life that theatre class has helped me in, is in my ability to **focus**. Once you memorize the lines, a big aspect of becoming your character is by focusing on your character's intentions. You learn to block out the audience, pay attention to your character's intentions and just focus on what you are doing.

I performed a quick search in your subreddit with ""religion"" and ""religious"" placed in the query, and did not come up with much.

Personally, I am a member of the Rationalist temperament (NT), and I believe it is pretty well established that most our population does not follow any organized religion; many are atheists, agnostics, pantheists, some buddhists (who are more attracted to the lifestyle) here and there, etc.; and those few that do happen to follow an organized religion often seem to have their own interpretations of it. I want to make it clear that I am not trying to start one of those annoying typical atheist shitstorm circlejerks seen at r/atheism, but rather am simply curious to see if there is a common underlying theme to the spiritual beliefs of your personality type.

In addition, I would like to add that I am very fond and often get along well with people of the INFP and INFJ personality types. We often experience the same difficulties of being pariahs in a superficial and deeply flawed society; and you are generally intelligent and caring people, who tend to share similar world views as me, albeit reached from a more humanist pathway vs. the scientific/logical pathway that I often take.

""A gentle enigma.""   

An amalgamation of outward influence and succumbing to ease of access.   
Too late to assess the situation and now must feel the consequence.   
Transgress space and time to places lined with spanning hills of green.   
Milestone homesteads all along the riverbed and eyes as wide as mountainsides.   
Under machine bearings and over serene fairings.   
Earth-glow acknowledgement.  

Pain, leave me lucky.  

Softly nestled pines of information, and the space station eye balls assess a situation easily identifiable.   
A kind liable to ""either-or"", a sign upon a Cedar door once told me to take it like a man, make a plan, make a   place and leave traces of yourself upon the earth.   

Red like the morning, ominous, adorning. We took it in stride. We could only bide our time as waves came upon   us, the setting changed like the universe does. Communion verses rang across the mind, leaving time to wallow in the deep blue, with its underwater undulations.   
Feeling communication, because my pupils were salted over. We could hear them as they called us over, no telling friend from enemy, butterfly from centipede.  
Pulling us from islands we just let the ocean tale unfold. Let our sails run high and cold as we left the waters of our homeland.   
We came through like the universe does, sat and wondered at how we let things seem so rigid, when the whole world is fluid and limited only by the senses. A change in lenses was inevitable and I began to see the patterns running ragged in the system. I forgot about the jagged rings of Saturn, or for anything else in this dark and tattered galaxy. Now I look for one to balance me and take away my silence but don't want any reliance on person place or thing, nouns fill the void, verbs add to ploys and plot can be abandoned. I can be my own stand in.   

Humanity waves are coursing, aren't they?   
Billions bring a tired earth to convulsion   
string up power nestled in her bosom  
The sun loves us, but can hate us  
today he showed me  
That faces mean nothing and creation leads one to all things  
Shelter under mothers wing, killing as she softly sings  
Meant to be  
Meant to be  
Run from shame and suffering   
Hunt them down and tear them out  
The bullets in her chest   
The ax head in her arm  
Such resolutions in her mind  
The constitution of a mothers love   
cold conclusions  
winter gloves   
I'll send her one   
A gift to ease her weariness   
A foot bath machine  
No that's too serious

As an INFP meeting new people is very tough for me.  Unfortunately I'm one of very few young people at my work (I'm an engineer, and I'm 21, there are only a handful of people within even a few years of me at work) and my work does not lend itself to being particularly sociable (very professional environment)

I run a lot and read a lot, so I figured those would be good avenues to meet people, I went to a run with the local running club, which was nice, but most of the people there were in their 30s and 40s, not exactly people I connected with.  I'm not sure how I can make reading social, I figure I might start hanging out at the library every now and then and striking up conversations.

I live in a pretty large apartment complex, so that is a good place to look, but I don't really know how I go about introducing myself to new people.  All my neighbors I've met, but they are mostly people in their 30s as well.

I've always done pretty well with people, and I've never had a time like this where I don't really have anyone in my life I can just hang out with.  I'm sure once I get the first friend or two things will smooth out, but I need to overcome that first hurdle.

Have any other INFPs been in this situation?  Most of my friends I met through semi-forced contact (in college I was on the Cross Country team and in a fraternity) so I never had to ""follow up"" actively on becoming friends with someone, it would happen more naturally.

It would be a shame for me to ask this and not share anything myself. Check the comments for my contribution.

*Edit: Or if someone just wants to talk but not necessarily in a public forum, PM me.

I know the word ""addiction"" is often (and incorrectly) used to signify a passion or obsessive quality people have for an object/activity/what have you. And while I firmly believe people can become addicted to just about anything, the majority of people who say ""I'm SO addicted to ____!"" are not people whose lives have been crippled by playing Farmville, collecting Beanie Babies, or reading trashy romance novels.

Anyone who's in recovery or has ""come back from the brink"" knows exactly what I'm talking about. It's where once is one time too many; where the ""desire"" to eat, drink, fuck or get high escalates from a fun once-in-a-while thing to an all-consuming compulsion that you do alone because you feel ashamed of it and literally cannot stop doing it. Maybe it took six months to hit bottom; maybe it took six years, or sixty.

And for anyone who believes that addiction is simply the failure of mind over matter, I am here to tell you kindly, but firmly, that you are 100% wrong. I can't paint a picture for you; it is one of those things that you have to experience (either directly or empathetically) to understand...though I suspect that INFPs who do not personally share this struggle will have less of a problem empathizing than would other populations.

He constantly talks about faking emotions, needing private space, and putting up a shield around himself. This all makes sense given his... occupation, but I feel that it clearly outlines his personality.

Has anyone else felt this connection to Dexter? Or to characters in other TV shows/books/movies/whatever? It's something I find myself wanting to chat about, but I feel like it has to be with like-minded people so I don't come across as a serial killer :P

I'm kinda new here and I don't really know who to talk to about this, but here goes nothing. My parents are control freaks and I think that this is especially damaging to me as an INFP. This is just to paint a picture of how bad it is: I'm turning 20 and my mom still persists in dragging me to work after school (ummm I'm in 3rd yr college???) with my 12 year-old brother because ""she doesn't trust our driver,"" although I think she just doesn't trust us both to begin with. Both my parents also seem to be purposely trying to keep me from learning how to commute and drive to keep an eye on me. I feel like I'm in grade school. Oh and yeah I live with my parents haha I can't go anywhere else

That's not the especially bothersome part, though. The thing is that I'm disorganized for a girl (our culture has this notion that girls are supposed to be much more composed than guys), and though I've tried to change it for years, it's in my nature to be scatterbrained and easily distracted. and I think this really sucks for me because whenever we're all home, they nit-pick the things I do. To a point where things get completely blown out of proportion and they end up just yelling at me and generally just trying to guilt-trip the hell out of me, while I just nod/mumble in place.

Sample scenario in our dining room earlier today, ft. mom and me:
Mom: ""Tris, what're you doing?""
Me: ""Making toast.""
Mom: ""Why did you only put one piece of bread in the toast?!?! That might burn the other side!!!!""
Me: ""Well I'm sorry, I'm only hungry for one piece...""
Mom: ""How many pieces of bread did you leave?!!? Your father needs four pieces of bread in the morning and we don't have much anymore! You finished the bread!!! How inconsiderate!!!""
Me: ""No, I only got one...""
Mom: ""What about dinner? You'll be too full for dinner!!!"" ....... 

Okay that may have seemed comical, but it's not when you're the one taking all the heat for it. FTLOG I still get internet-grounded for the stupidest reasons (e.g. said toast incident.) I really don't wanna engage them, though. I've tried asking them to hear me out, but to no avail. I mostly just end up taking all the unnecessary heat for every minuscule thing they find off about me.

I'd also be curious to hear about creative or semi-creative careers that don't involve freelance work, so if you work in one of those or can think of any, feel free to share your knowledge.

A while ago I tested as an ENFJ, read up on functions and went for INFJ, which I have flaired around for weeks before an INTJ pointed out to me that I came across as an INFP.

I've read up on your posts and I feel so whole! I take MBTI heavily salted but it just adds zest to the flavor, now.

I have taken [this](http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm) test also, which shows what functions you use most and I score excellent on Fe. Thing is, I feel that my Fe is forced, and I have figured out why by seeing myself as an INFP. I grew up as an expat child, having lived in six countries by the time I was fifteen, causing me to adapt to different cultures by way of Fe (I think) before I had formed myself. I had to be conscious of roledynamics because every country made me a different person, I relied on how I was perceived to figure out how I should behave. I attributed all my adolescent insecurites towards having been an expat and now I feel like I know why, my Fe has sort of suppressed my Fi.

While I do love INFJs, INFPs are the ones that make me feel my potential. I feel like I have been living in the shadow functions quite comfortably because I have developed them in the stress of constantly losing myself as a child. I have thought about my life as an expat so much, read up on expats, fictional and not, identifying with diaspora's and such things, but the very simple pointing out that I come across as an INFP brought the wave of clicks I've been searching for.

My question to you is, how do I get out of the shadows? How do I get more comfortable being my Fi? I feel inconsiderate when feeling my own feelings, logically I know that is unnecessary but it is ingrained in me to adjust to others.

I'm a male INFP and the person I would likely consider my best friend is, as the title suggests, a female INFP. We have a lovely friendship and all, but there always seems to be some sort of unspoken communication problems between us. I'll name off a few examples so this doesn't get too disorganized. 

* She trusts me with various things, but getting deeper into her mind (something she is often ridiculed for, sadly enough) is very difficult. 

* We both have periods of silence, which is understandable given the nature of our personalities, but these periods often conflict with one another, which is often troublesome. 

* She is notoriously bad at communicating digitally. I'd love to hang out with her more, but we often just don't find the time, unfortunately. But she is horrible at texting and isn't on Facebook too often, so communication again suffers from this. 

* Adding on to the communication problems: I always seem to begin the conversation. Sometimes (rarely), she will and its wonderful, but otherwise it's usually me seeking her out, which often feels forced and somewhat unnatural for me even though I just really want to talk to her. 

* She has been in a bit of a funk lately and now I find myself in one as well. I don't know if she's on my mind too much or if it's just happening independently or what, but I haven't been writing at all lately...

That's the extent of it, I believe. She's also just very vague sometimes, which, admittedly, is interesting, though it's frustrating all the same. We also mutually don't want to date one another because that would just feel even more strange. 

I'm more venting my frustrations now more than anything, but considering there's a large female population on this subreddit, I was wondering if anyone here can relate to her and what's on in her mind, perhaps lending me some clarity and peace regarding my relationship with her?

    I would like to hear experiences of INFP's working in the corporate world. As you all might be aware, it is not truly a thriving area for INFP's because of many factors like a) avoiding conflict b) being authentic c) intuitive thinking vs logical thinking etc. My question is to hear about your experience in corporate world / industry jobs - good or bad and how you deal with work on day to day basic.

I will start with mine: 
I work with a large software company as a lead engineer and even though I am not exactly cut out for this largely analytical job, I find my inspiration by:
1) Being passionate about creating a great product and problem solving (however small).
2) Motivating young engineers to grow, learn and do their best.

My survival strategy:
1) I like to stay away from power-plays, politics etc.
2) Learnt really hard way and after long time how to not take most things personally, it helped me a lot.
3) Building deeper relationships with the team - you will never know how they will help you in the long run.

So far so good, I am being rewarded for the efforts. I will add more later in response to comments.

Your turn.

My grandma is notoriously bad about caring for her pets. She gets them for selfish reasons and then complains when they act like normal animals. She gets rid of them because she'd rather buy pot than pay a pet deposit. Stuff like that.

So, *immediately after getting rid of a cat that she'd had for a year* **(given to a kill shelter and then euthanized because it was an old cat)**, *then getting a dog, then getting rid of the dog*, my grandma got a kitten. This is her third pet in ONE YEAR. I begged her to reconsider, but my grandma is very stubborn (notoriously, and very frustratingly so) and just ignored me. *She* wanted a cat, so she got one. No logic or consideration for the well-being of the animal was even considered. She is an immediate gratification sort of person.

So she got the cat. Complained constantly about the kitten being ""annoying"" and ""loud""...it's a kitten. I told her to get an older cat because they are generally cuddly and not hyper, but of course she ignored me. She refused to pay her pet deposit, so she has to hide her goddamn cat when her landlord comes around. She also complains regularly because the kitten meows. This frustrates me because I know that she would rather get rid of the cat than to pay a pet deposit when she's eventually found out.

She also has a job where her pet is alone for long periods of time. Like, days. Jinx, her kitten, was scratching furniture (but she didn't listen to me when I explained how to train him!) and generally being loud and lonely. **SO SHE GOT ANOTHER CAT.**

Here's the thing: if you can barely care for one pet, give it to a family while it's still young and has a chance for being adopted. Don't get *another* cat that you can't take care of that will probably end up in a shelter in a year or two.

So this weekend on my deck, she says, ""I'm going to get my cats' claws removed.""

I flipped shit. I was so beyond angry with her.

On the chance that none of you know, declawing is a major surgery. It's very painful. It's illegal in fourteen countries. It has serious side affects, and it's completely unnecessary. For a human, declawing a cat is equivalent to having the tips of the fingers cut off at the first joint below the fingernail. Once the cat goes home, he or she will have trouble walking for several days. One vet described, ""cats bouncing off the walls of the recovery cage because of excruciating pain. Cats that are more stoic huddle in the corner of the recovery cage, immobilized in a state of helplessness, presumably by the overwhelming pain."" There is also speculation that behavioral problem arise in cats that undergo declaw surgery (although there is no hard evidence). 

Vets also suspect that declawing causes many behavioral issues. For example, immediately following the surgery, it is painful for a cat to use the litter box. The cat then associates pain with using the litter box, which may result in the cat using other areas of the house for elimination. Other behavioral side affects are biting and personality changes. Because the cat no longer has its claws for protection, he or she may overcompensate for the loss by biting. The cat may also become withdrawn or stressed due to the loss of its claws. The stress could be caused by many things including the inability to simply jump onto an object, like a chair or couch or bed, and hold on with its claws. Even the joy of playing will be altered because the cat will no longer be able to grasp string or other toys with its claws. 

And yet, because she's too lazy to just TRIM their GODDAMNED CLAWS, she's going to put her ""beloved"" pets through this pain and misery. So I kinda flipped. I told her to give them away if she can't take care of them, that it's illegal and considered abuse in just about every other first- and second-world country, and that when she got the pets she signed a waiver promising to never de-claw her cat. She blew me off.

I don't really know what to do, but I'm so angry and so upset with her right now.

[Source.](http://www.paw-rescue.org/declaw_paper.php)

Edit: I sent her a polite email with the link to paw rescue. I offered to teach her how to clip her cats claws and told her I would explain how to ""scratch proof"" her home. She hasn't responded and I don't think she will. If she continues with her plan I'm going to let the shelters in the area know so that they can black-list her.

I basically just typed anything that was coming to my head... Sooo yeah, sorry if the grammar is a little off or if you find it hard to read.


Considering most conversations that take place on this subreddit deal with a world I have, for the most part, yet to venture into, I have a question or two about being an INFP in high school (just if your wondering the type of high school experiences I have, I live in the United States)

But anyway, I'm 17 and have always noticed my perception of life as being a little different than anyone my age. I've always felt like the ""secret"" parent in my group of friends. Like, I have the wisdom to be a guide/counselor in a friends life.. But I only let it out of its cage when the individual asks for it.. Or clearly needs it.

I'm getting sidetracked, I'm posting this for feedback on teenage relationships (non romantic)  with fellow INFPs.

For me, Very rarely I cross paths with someone who, i just know, understands my outlook on life.. And when i do, they usually understand that I understand that.
(A Mutual understanding)

The only problem is that, we know there's a bond between us so we never really feel the need to try to become friends..  It's like we expect it to happen on its own.
And in some cases a friendship is formed, but in most.. Well, nothing ever sprouts, and after a while its just too weird to start talking again because.. well I don't know 

Bottom line.. I'm not sure how to make friends with other INFPs. I realize the only way for it to work is if we are both our genuine personality when we socialize... But it's just so difficult to do so in a highschool environment, where everyone judges you for having the slightest difference in opinion or looks.

It's dawned on me that we *can* and *do* have the ability to spread joy and create an impact, even in the smallest of forms. Who knows, by initiating seeds of kindness, maybe some people will pass it along - developing into massive blooms that touch upon more than one person?
Hmm, maybe acts of kindness can evolve? What do you think?

Hey Natalie... 


I’ve been waiting a long time to write this letter. Deep down I always felt that one day I would write it. I don’t even know if I’m going to send it though. Maybe it will forever remain a file on my computer never to be printed out and sent snail-mail. Or maybe you will rip the letter to shreds, throw it away and decide you rather I remain someone that you used to know. I wouldn’t blame you if you did. But on the off chance you don’t, I decided there are a few things I want you to know.   



I’m sorry. It has been near a year since last I spoke to you. I realize you probably don’t understand my seemingly random/immature decision to cut you out of my life. Sure, there was our falling out, but there was more to it than that. I was going through a lot personally my senior year of high school. The issues followed me into college. However, I think I can say that I am not the person I was a year ago. But who I was said a lot of things to you that haunt me to this day.  
 


For the latter half of high school and first semester of college, I suffered from two psychological disorders. They were Major Depressive Disorder and Avoidant Personality Disorder. Essentially, I isolated myself from everyone. I convinced myself I wasn’t normal, that I couldn’t have friends and I would never really have a social life. I was a hermit at the age of 17. Of course, I still spoke up in class and had a few acquaintances, but for the most part I kept to myself. I didn’t turn to my family for help because of the religious differences between them and I. I was just as socially awkward/isolated at church as I was at school. I didn’t seem to fit in with anyone… anywhere. I disqualified myself from the human race. Unless I was around you.  

  

It is actually a bit of a miracle that you actually let me be your boyfriend in the first place. I don’t even really remember how it happened. I had always liked you since middle school. You were kind of my best friend. I remember the e-mails we used to send to each other. The smiles we traded in hallways between class. How sad I was when we went to different high schools. I don’t know what gave me the courage to spend more time with you towards the end of Junior year. Maybe it was our annual Elitch Gardens excursion. I think that was it. All I knew is that I wanted to be around you every spare moment I had. 



I think saying I was a little “clingy” when we dated is an incredible understatement. You were literally everything; I never truly invested myself in anything or anyone before you. I had good grades and did extra circulars at school, but I felt no passion. Passion was the only thing I felt when you said you would be my girlfriend haha… For the first time in my life I found someone that validated me. Someone who didn’t tell me what to believe in, what assignments to do, what rules I was breaking, or what I should be doing with myself. Someone who accepted me for me. I went from someone with little to no self-esteem to someone with a girlfriend, and you paid the price. 



I was the personification of the phrase “misery loves company” towards the end of our relationship. I wanted you to need me as much as I needed you, and when I realized that wasn’t the case… I lost it. I became manipulative, derogatory, and pressuring for physical intimacy. I became a controlling monster. And you did the only logical thing there was to do; put distance between you and me. I practically couldn’t get out of bed for a week after that. I couldn’t even be your friend. I was so self-absorbed in self-pity and doubt that it was all I could do to stay on top of my school work. I got a C for the first time on my semester report card too. Everything at that point in my life was a catastrophe. I lost my high school sweetheart, my straight A’s and B’s transcript and all my parents could tell me was that everything would be alright if I started going back to church. No one understood the depth of my misery. Well fine. If the world didn’t get along with me I decided I wouldn’t get along with the world. 



The reason I didn’t go to my own graduation was because of the complete disconnect I had with… well, everyone the 2nd semester of senior year. (I think you asked me that at one point… I think… but I brushed off the question) I became a bit of a delinquent. I blatantly slept in class, skipped a lot of assignments and didn’t take end of the year exam preparations seriously. I think this, combined with the fact that I earned a scholarship (which was as much luck as hard work paying off), really pushed the buttons of everyone around me. I wasn’t acting like a mature, intellectual scholar who deserved to be funded to go to school. I acted like an adolescent hothead with a serious attitude problem. They say you either turn your pain into sadness or anger. I decided to do the latter publically for the first time in my life. I didn’t show up for some of my exams at the end of the year. I told my parents I would skip them all if they didn’t let me skip my own graduation. So they did. I think it was a relief when I finally went off to college for them. I was nearly impossible to live with. I was overly critical, angry, a walking-time bomb… They said I would do a lot of growing up at college. They were right. 



I was no longer living with my family. Roommates and strangers don’t have any obligation to put up with outrageous behavior. So I reverted back to my original high school ways. I became a ghost. I spoke only when spoken to, buried myself in my work and developed a really weird sleeping pattern. (I would go to bed after lunch and wake up, do homework, and then go to class. Rinse and repeat) Acquaintances would ask me where the hell I studied and what I did all day. I would simply shrug it off and mutter something about being a strong introvert. Only my two roommates knew I tended to sleep most days away. Slowly, my peers developed their social circles and accepted that I did not want their friendship. I told myself I chose to be alone. I enjoyed solitude. I tried to shun my loneliness out of existence. There was one person who noticed my behavior though. Her name was Julianne. 



Julianne was my next door neighbor in the women’s triple next to mine. She was just as quiet as I was. I remember sitting down and having a 2 hour heart to heart with her at one point in time. She asked me if I was having depression issues. She told me my habits and demeanor reminded her of herself in high school before she decided to homeschool. Sadly, she also didn’t get along with her parents much at home. The only real difference between her story and mine was the fact she had been receiving therapy regularly. She encouraged me to start seeing an on-campus councilor/therapist. I owe her a lot for the moment she threatened to schedule the appointment for me if I didn’t do it myself or show up to it. 



It wasn’t long before I started to develop feelings for her; I still desperately wanted the intimacy of a girlfriend. I remember pretending to do homework with her alone in a classroom late one night, unable to focus, pinned between anxiety and desire. I ended up hastily grabbing her hand as she was leaving the room. She looked at me quizzically, removed her hand from mine, and said something that has stuck with me to this day: “Two broken people don’t make a whole.”



Seeing an on-campus councilor/therapist (I don’t know the difference) helped a little, but talking to someone for an hour a week about a lifetime of problems is incredibly frustrating. It’s like putting a Band-Aid over a mortal wound or quenching your thirst through the world’s smallest straw. (If I had it my way, I would kidnap a bunch of therapists and lock myself in a room with them. I wouldn’t let them leave until I felt like I had an adequate understanding of my fucked-upness. Eh... Probably a bad idea. If I didn’t bring provisions we probably die of dehydration) I received a C my 2nd block/class (Colorado College is on the block plan; you take one class a month at a time) and seriously considered dropping out of college. I was ready to throw away my scholarship. I felt like I didn’t deserve it. I wasn’t even a semester in and I was getting grades I told myself I wouldn’t get in college. I think the only reason I didn’t was because I didn’t know what else I would do. I rather deal with school than go back and live with my parents. 



It was at this point that my depression intensified to a critical level. I reached the semester break of and went back home. Those two weeks were perhaps the worst in my life. There was something about being home, alone among my family, that messed with me more than being at school ever could. I would sleep for 12 hours at a time and wake up without the motivation to leave my bed or room. And I didn’t have class, or any other obligation, so I rarely did. I locked myself up in my room with my computer and Xbox, wasting my days away on the internet. After a few days, even these activities I had always relied failed to distract me. My media became meaningless. I had no class to attend. No homework to do. No girl to anxiously pursue. But I did have a new temptress. Her name was Suicide.   



My parents took me to emergency room when I mentally fell apart in front of them after one particularly bitter argument. I was taken to a mental facility 3 in the morning in the back of an ambulance. That ride was one of the most surreal experiences in my life…

Artistic - excel at photography, writing, drawing, etc. (kind of wish I'd been an art teacher instead). 

Therapeutic - I am the person to whom everyone tells their secrets. I have worked with kids with all types of disabilities and have had a lot of personal success, as well as building amazing relationships. 

Spiritual: I am most interested in reading about and working on my own spiritual learning and practice. In my free time I am almost constantly drawn to developing that side of me. Reading, writing, drawing, and meditating = favorite free time activities.

is this possible? a little back story: i went through a major depression and emerged from it a different person. one friend even commented my facial expressions went from vivid and demonstrative to flat and rigid.

I would remind myself to think positively and think critically about reasons why she would not be looking for other guys, which calmed my nerves.  Those feelings have since settled down after a while.  However, now I am not sure if we are very compatible with each other (in the long run).  She seems introverted also.  When we are together it is a blast.  But I don't get to see her often and she doesn't call often either.  Have any other infp's had these ""doubts"".  For me when I'm with her I feel like taking another step with her, but then I always ""think"" of a reason to take another step back.  Maybe its because we haven't hung out in a long time or because I have to give her money every month or because I don't think our personalities are necessarily the best match.  Still, I feel we both really like each other but are a bit afraid of both taking steps forward.  I think she might also be an infp.  Also, I am an inf or tp (dominant f though).

The main reason I ask you is because Fi is your dominant function, whereas it's my secondary. I have a friend who may be either an ENTP or an ENFP, and I'm trying to get a solid, clear description of both Ti and Fi subjectively, not just objectively. I'm curious to know your thoughts on the difference.

I made the post in /r/mbti , but I thought I'd visit you and the INTP board as well to get your opinion on it.

&gt; A friend elaborated on a specific portion of the Ti Fi divide today that hit me with a few questions. It went something like this...

&gt; ""If I have a set of moral values that I live by, logically, in play with the actions of others and the implications of those values on each decision I make, which would it be? Doesn't that have parts of both Fi and Ti? Decisions based on the values I place great importance in, but also logically attuned to other factors, almost in equal proportions? I don't lack personal values, but I don't lack sense either.""

&gt; What does this mean for their decision-making process? They can't have both in the leading positions, obviously. I'd guess Ti, but there are so many elements of Fi that I just don't know. To add, I think in a way it could be said that ""my personal value system that I strictly adhere to is based in logic.""

I wonder if some of you might be interested in just having a conversation, sharing what's on our minds. We might not have a campfire to talk over, but this is a real human space.

More than anything these days I struggle to activate my passions. I have a pretty cool life in a big-enough, American city. I'm young. I don't have a soulless corporate job. I have loads of time for my creative endeavors. I am friendly with some of the best people I've ever met on the planet. I have a lot of time to read and reflect and write and ponder and pace over and struggle to grasp abstract, distant worlds of wisdom and history and interconnectedness. Over the early landscape of my 20's I've grown patient and kinder and more empathic and focused and connected with simpler and more sustainable means of happiness. I am mostly my own boss. I have almost everything I need to start the next big step, to barrel myself towards my next big, hair, audacious goal. Despite everything, I can't seem to leave the ground.

I think many of us (not just INFP's), have a grander project in mind — something they would be doing if money were no object in life. I want to make films, and I can't commit to an idea. Hundreds of whisperings of grand visions alight upon me, but nothing feels good enough. I have skills and global concerns and philosophical anxieties, and I always end up feeling like the deeper I dig, the more lost I feel, the dumber I feel, the less certain I feel. What I find is an endlessly bigger picture that encumbers my understanding and darkens my confidence in what to discuss with people. More than ever, I know that I just need to start, so I've begun to organize my life in ways that bend my habits and minimize distractions. I feel like I'm getting there, I just don't quite know what's missing.

It was the most serious relationship I'd had up to that point and I took it pretty badly - I tried (unsuccessfully) to win her back, then impulsively quit my job and ended up in a ""fat Elvis"" period where I was just eating way too much and feeling totally defeated and insecure. I've since been able to turn things around: I got a new job in a new town, lost the weight I gained (and then some!) and gotten back into my main hobby, making music, again. But I still feel as lonely as I did since the breakup.

I have a lot of trouble not having someone to confide in or share my feelings with. Friends and family can help sometimes, but it's never quite the same. I want that level of intimacy that comes with a relationship, where you can just be totally open and honest with yourself and with the other person. Plus, I feel very alienated from my friends and family because I realize now that I don't have a lot in common with most of them.

I feel awful for feeling the way I do because I know that it's not fair to crave such intense relationships or to feel like your life is worthless if you don't have a girlfriend or something. In fact, that's part of the problem - I've realized that one of the reasons the breakup affected me so much wasn't her specifically, it was that I lost that feeling of closeness and warmth that came from her. I'm worried, now that I have tried to start dating again, that whoever I choose to date will just be there to fill that void. I don't want to use anyone, but I don't want to feel so empty either. What should I do?

**TL;DR** What do you do when you don't have a romantic partner or someone you can be intimate with? How do you fill that gap in your life, so to speak? How do you fight loneliness?

1. They make you feel sorry for them.

2. They make you feel worried or afraid.

3. They give you the impression you owe them.

4. They make you feel used.

5. Sometimes you suspect they don't care about you.

6. They lie to you and deceive you.

7. They take a lot from you and give back very little.

8. They make you feel guilty (and use that to manipulate you).

9. They take advantage of your kindness.

10. They are easily bored and need constant stimulation.

11. They don't take responsibility, but place blame elsewhere.


So today, I stopped. I just stopped caring about what he said to me, or tried to do to me to get me to do what he wants me to do. To manipulate me. It's been going on for a long time; and today, I just... disregarded him. I instantly noticed that he was trying to get my attention more as I did. Usually, I'd acknowledge him right away and he'd ignore me for a little bit and then get back to me. I'm not sure that's a good sign, because he may just want my attention to try and get 'power' over me or something.

Just because I'm an INFP, doesn't mean I'll stand for people pushing me around constantly. I've been dealing with it for the better part of a year now; and because I was so naturally empathetic, I fell right into his 'guilt traps'. Even when things had NOTHING to do with me!

He's nice when he wants something, will compliment us; but as soon as you disagree with him, or have a priority that isn't his own, he flips. Completely flips. And I realize that now.

Just kinda staying home and internet-ing.  I came to realize, when an FB friend of mine died, that I was missing out on life.  all the people that were so sad over his death and I realized not many people would show to my funeral.

So I began in the last two month to hang out more to attempt to find people and have relationships with them.  You see, I am not unattractive.  I am not socially awkward.  People generally like me if i give them a chance, so it is not too hard.  

But. and this is the big butt.  I now remember why I stopped trying, stopped going out.  It is because I have expectations of people that are NEVER lived up to.  Mostly with men btw.  I expect them to act a certain way and when they do not I am so fucking hurt by it.  My feelings are too intense even with acquaintances.  

So my question to you, my fellow INFP'ers is how do I stop expecting more of people?  When they don't live up to my standards, how do I just bounce back?  'Cause I wanna have friends but I will drop them so fast that it becomes heartache.  I hate heartache so I will avoid social interaction.

It all started when we moved in together. You know how we INFP folk get SUPER attached? Well, that happened. This guy and I bonded rather quickly at the beginning of our relationship and then--what seemed out of nowhere to me--the bond was just gone. He stopped paying as much attention to me, started getting frustrated with my need for someone to sit and listen to my ramblings, and basically stopped all emotional support. Right at this time, he became really good friends with one of my classmates and started inviting her over all the time and giving her all the love and support that he once gave to me. I feel like I'm invisible when she's around. 

So naturally, I got jealous. I never got to really spend time with my boyfriend and it was driving me insane. Not to mention the inner conflict resulting from jealousy toward a friend. So things got worse and worse and I tried and tried to fix my problem on my own and it just wouldn't go away. 

So right before thanksgiving, we had a huge fight and it resulted in me getting kicked out of the apartment and putting the relationship ""on a break"". And let me just say that all of my issues are now intensified and I am more sad and lonely than I have ever felt before in my life. I feel like I got cut off from the family that I was once a part of and that their lives are all going on and I'm getting left behind and no one even notices that I'm gone. 

So I'd like to hear what my fellow INFPs have done to cope with such heartbreaking situations because I'm not coping well at all and I'm really scared about everything right now.

I was a Team Lead in customer service for a nationally known software company and it about CRUSHED my soul. I found myself having to adhere to policies that were cheating people...or even if the customer WAS wrong I'd feel guilty knowing that I couldn't help them. All-in-all, I ended up having MASSIVE anxiety and questioned my entire existence.

My favorite job was probably working at the nursing home in dining services. It wasn't glamorous but I got to see the same people every day which let me develop deeper relationships with people. I genuinely felt like I was doing something good. 


Second favorite was working at the bookstore because...well...I was surrounded by books! When things were quiet I could sneak off and read a few chapters of a graphic novel or book. 

Right now I'm finishing up my English degree and I'm hoping to go to Korea to teach English sometime next year. I want to learn Korean because after hearing about all the stuff going down in North Korea...I can't ignore it. So, I can go to South Korea, teach some kids some English, save up money to pay off debts (I hate feeling like a slave...being in debt makes me feel like one but that's a whole other post) and hopefully learn Korean. I'm hoping I can use that back in the states and work for an NK aid organization or something....but nothings set in stone, naturally hahaha.


So, enough about me, what about you guys? I'm sorry if this was posted before, I'm just really curious what types of jobs suit us best...and what kind of jobs kill our souls!

I don't even know what he is anymore, is very controlling. Whenever I don't agree to do something he wants to do, he gets pissed off at me and tries to make me feel guilty for it. I just realized today that he was, in fact, a sociopath. 

He does all the things I found listed on [this](http://www.youmeworks.com/sociopaths.html) site, such as:

1. They make you feel sorry for them.

2. They make you feel worried or afraid.

3. They give you the impression you owe them.

4. They make you feel used.

5. Sometimes you suspect they don't care about you.

6. They lie to you and deceive you.

7. They take a lot from you and give back very little.

8. They make you feel guilty (and use that to manipulate you).

9. They take advantage of your kindness.

10. They are easily bored and need constant stimulation.

11. They don't take responsibility, but place blame elsewhere.


So today, I stopped. I just stopped caring about what he said to me, or tried to do to me to get me to do what he wants me to do. To manipulate me. It's been going on for a long time; and today, I just... disregarded him. I instantly noticed that he was trying to get my attention more as I did. Usually, I'd acknowledge him right away and he'd ignore me for a little bit and then get back to me. I'm not sure that's a good sign, because he may just want my attention to try and get 'power' over me or something.

Just because I'm an INFP, doesn't mean I'll stand for people pushing me around constantly. I've been dealing with it for the better part of a year now; and because I was so naturally empathetic, I fell right into his 'guilt traps'. Even when things had NOTHING to do with me! Now I see what he was up to.

Do you guys have any advice on this? Should I try to get this person out of my life? He's affecting other people as well. My *actual* friends, whom I don't necessarily want to just 'leave to the wolves', so to speak xP. He's really upsetting a bunch of my friends, but none of them really seem to be trying to deal with it. I'm not sure if I should tell my friends that I think this guy's a sociopath, or to just keep it to myself and nudge them into thinking that he's unhealthy to be around? Should I let them decide for themselves? It kills me to see my friends (one in particular gets extremely guilted by him, and has even cried to me multiple times about how badly he's made her feel) get manipulated by this guy. 

He's nice when he wants something, will compliment us; but as soon as you disagree with him, or have a priority that isn't his own, he flips. Completely flips. And I realize that now.

So yeah, this was pretty much a rant. Thanks for listening to my problems, if you've gotten this far x3. Feels good to get this stuff off my chest. And any advice on how to deal with the situation would be great!

**TL;DR** - I just realized my ""friend"" is a sociopath. He's manipulative and narcissistic, and if someone doesn't agree to his priorities or to do a favour for him, he completely flips his shit. His favourite tactic is the 'guilt trip', which has been quite effective in the past. But now I'm onto him. How should I deal with this? Drop him from my life entirely? Gradually cut contact?
