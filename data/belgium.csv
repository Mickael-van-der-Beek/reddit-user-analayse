I need some local help with a small project and I thank you in advance for considering it!

(mods, I read the wiki on posting and this seemed ok, but if this is not an acceptable post for this subreddit I'm sorry, just feel free to delete it)

I've been with my girlfriend for almost 10 years now, but we've been apart for the last 5 as I've been enrolled in a PhD program in a different country. I'm finally finishing writing up my thesis and should be done in about a month and an half. I want to tell her I'm coming home in a special way. 

I would like for her to receive a postcard from all the places we've visited together these past years. Each postcard would have just one letter in it, nothing more. Together they would spell an url where there would be a message from me telling her that I'm going home to her. 

I already enlisted [/r/England](http://www.reddit.com/r/england/comments/1i2wph/hi_rengland_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help_with_a/), [/r/Unitedkingdom](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1i31ry/hi_runitedkingdom_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help/), [/r/California](http://www.reddit.com/r/California/comments/1i3bu0/hi_rcalifornia_i_would_like_to_ask_your_help_with/), [/r/Italy](http://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/1i5djq/hi_ritaly_i_would_like_to_ask_for_your_help_with/) and [/r/France](http://www.reddit.com/r/france/comments/1it0qh/hi_rfrance_i_would_like_to_ask_for_your_help_with/). Going through the different regions where I need postcards from. 

While I would like to repay for the postcard and the stamp, I reckon it would probably be really costly and troublesome to arrange for a bank transfer so I'll gladly offer a month of reddit gold as a token of gratitude for both the time and money spent with this.

We've traveled quite a bit over the years, I came here looking for someone from Bruges (I saw there's a dedicated subreddit but seems quite dead) as I already have Brussels, but if you happen to be in any of these other cities and would be up to give me a hand I would be really thankful.

Update #1: OK people, there's a lot more interest in a Belgian meetup than I had anticipated. I'll have to make it much more organised. Have a little patience while I set things up.

Update #2: I think I speak for everyone when I say: EVERYONE is welcome to join us!

Update #3: [Date poll](http://www.doodle.com/wtapy3mwb8ywpxdp) is up

Update #4: [Location poll](http://poll.pollcode.com/ln5l) is up as well.

Update #5: Anyone that's willing to offer a place to stay or a ride, please PM me so I can maintain a list. Provide what you're willing to do and in what city.

Update #6: OK people, the result for the location SO FAR is Gent by 1 vote more than Leuven. I myself can drive up to 4 other people from Leuven or Brussels or Gent to wherever we meet.
And please don't forget to fill in the date  poll!

Update #7: I've chosen FOUR dates from the Doodle, we'll do each city once:

I have no idea yet on which city will be visited on which date. You can discuss this here if you want and then I'll make a decision based on your input.

UPDATE #8: New poll with date/location combinations is up -&gt; http://poll.pollcode.com/gpkl

UPDATE #9: As of right now the following date/location combination is up by 1 vote. How many of you can make it to Gent this Sunday?

**There's a suggestion to meetup today 22/04 in Gent at Patrick Foley's. Who will be joining us?? Please leave a reply to my post in the comments!!!!**

I don't really know where I stand on the matter. 

On the one hand I really understand all the people getting upset about her release. What she helped to do over 16years ago was monstrous and should in no way be denied. 
On the other hand, shouldn't everyone deserve a second chance? She has been in jail for 16years. 16! Even though our jail system is relatively cosy with reports of inmates having the ability to even own a plasystation, I think a lot of people underestimate what it is to be locked up in jail. You have ZERO freedom. So when someone has been there for 16years, shouldn't we at least consider seeing if the person feel remorse. I mean, what's the point in punishing someone if we don't allow them to better themselves after?

I really liked the following article from [Knack](http://www.knack.be/opinie/columns/rik-van-cauwelaert/de-superieure-reactie-van-moeder-eefje-lambrecks/opinie-4000168526132.htm) talking about how the mother of Eefje Embrechts feels.

I'm a nineteen year old student currently studying in Brussels. I study at an English speaking university for Erasmus students and other foreigners who wish to study in English. I am very very interested in trying to stay here and integrate myself into Belgium and its culture. I know a very limited amount of French, and my Dutch is coming along as well. Currently I'm taking courses to improve my language skills in both. In August, KULeuven is holding intensive Dutch courses, and I've heard that people come out fluent or near fluent by the end. HOWEVER, I'm scheduled to leave at the end of May.

I have many personal reasons for wanting to live in Belgium. For one, my career interests include international law, and the whole idea of integrating myself into a different culture is probably the most appealing sounding thing in the world to me. People say I'm young, but I seriously have never found myself so happy in my entire life. I want to make something work here. If I could find work, an extension on my visa, and a university (I may just stay at the one I'm at now, but I would prefer to live in Flanders), I really think I could really start trying to come Belgian permanently. 

I came here to see what r/belgium had to say and what kind of advice you guys maybe had to offer. I'm very open to any kind of ideas that come to mind; this is a very serious desire I have to become Belgian.

TLDR: American girl wants to permanently move to Belgium. Want ideas on how to start or where to go. 

If any of you have any questions, feel free to ask away. ",,False,,t5_2qhe6,False,,,True,t3_q8i2g,http://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/q8i2g/considering_trying_to_become_belgian/,

We had a lovely stay in Belgium, which ended up being extended. Afterwords we were sent to Berlin, Belgium to follow his work.
I rode a bus for the first time in my life and it was fantastic! I worked as a tour guide in Bruges for a few weeks with a few girlfriends. Their husbands work with my SO so they needed something to occupy their time and taught me how to do it too.
I didn't finish much art at all, which is a bummer. There were so many other things to do that I didn't have the time or energy to draw in my room.
I didn't have much trouble at all getting around, buying things, etc. and picked up a little Dutch. Well, enough to read menus when we went out and be polite, my SO really appreciated the menu part.
I had to purchase a phone in Belgium because my phone is too old to work in Europe, there was no way to switch out the chip. But now I'm going to use that new phone as my main way of talking and get rid of my old one, so that's an improvement.
I was prepared for the expense, but ended up only spending about $500 USD not counting my plane ticket.
Thank you all so very much! You made me less nervous and gave me a lot of great information. I'm sorry that I bugged you all with a question like this one, I just knew that the good people of Reddit were reliable and trustworthy.

**TL;DR: You guys are awesome, I was worried about nothing, Europe is amazing, and I'm in love with Belgium.**





Hello! I was just hoping for a little advice/information from you regarding Belgium. My SO is flying from Nevada to Brussels for the month of February for work and has asked me to join him. It's a very last minute trip and I am not at all prepared, though I am terribly excited. 
    I am from Texas and really only speak English and a little Spanish. I don't want to commit any social crimes during my visit so if there are any customs or manners of dress that I need to observe please let me know. 
    I will have oodles of free time while my SO is working, but I am worried that I will end up staying in our hotel room for lack of things to do (not that there's nothing to do, just that I won't know of the things that I could be doing).

Thank you for reading and for all of your help!

**TL;DR: My SO called today and said ""Surprise! You're going to Belgium!"" and now I'm worried about everything.**

Edit: Thank you to everyone that is responding. I'm already breathing easier. 

To add some details I left out:

* I have never been out of the United States before and I have only traveled to Arkansas, California, New Mexico, Utah, and Nevada. (Not counting trips I took as a child that I barely remember.)

* I'm very interested in nature and art. I am an artist and I am studying to become an art teacher. It is a goal of mine, if I am there for a month, to have at least a few pieces of art completed before I fly home.

* I'm in Las Vegas Nevada currently, my SO is male, and we are in our early twenties. 

* He will be working very close to **Oostkamp** so we will be staying in that area, though it seems like I shouldn't have too much trouble with travel times. 

* I'm really excited to use public transportation because I have never really had the opportunity to do so before. I will admit that it is intimidating to think about though, seeing as I'll probably be by myself for most of the trip.

I'm getting increasingly worried about this because I notice that a lot of people of my generation share this problem. I think it's pretty self-evident considering the amount of exposure young Flemings get to the English language nowadays that our knowledge of French is not what it used to be. Looking at the political problems our country faces right now, I think this ever-widening language gap is the last thing we need.

A solution that sometimes comes up is to make English an official language. When I meet French-speaking Belgians abroad, it often comes natural for us to switch to English. I think the main point that I'm trying to make is that we, as a nation, should do everything in our power to prevent that our peoples simply can't communicate with each other. I simply do not trust the media or the politicians to communicate for us.

This idea might be very ""Flemishcentric"". I know Flemings, in general, are better at English than Walloons but is this problem insurmountable (I honestly don't know)? I, for one, wouldn't mind one bit if Wallonian schools spend more time teaching English and stop teaching Dutch altogether. Who could blame the Wallonian youth for choosing English over Dutch? The older generation might also have problems with English but this proposition deals more with the future of Belgium rather than its current form. Maybe we could start preparing now to make English an official language in -let's say- twenty years. 

Furthermore, Belgium could profit this way by making it a safe haven for international companies (even more than it already is). It can't be bad for business to have a populace that's largely fluent in English. 

As you may have already noticed: I am in no way an expert in these matters. I was just wondering what r/belgium has to say about this. Is this scenario even slightly realistic? Is it even a solution to anything? and if not: what other options are there?

It's a pretty simple app that displays the timetables of the busstops for De Lijn.


I've been struggling with de lijn every month because they never sent me the datasets on time, so at the end of every month I got lots of bad comments on my app(stops missing, no busses, stuff like that)...


this resulted in a lot of unhappy users.

while all this time they promised me to give me access to webservices that would fill in the gaps and allow me to code a route planner (from A to B) and kept postponing it like they did with the datasets


so a month ago they really exagerated and gave me the datasets 3 weeks too late, (kept ketting bad comments almost every day, people saying the app is shit and doesn't work).

then they release their own app that's connected to their webservice and has all the functions their site has while my app was down.

Now my app dropped from 7000 users to 6500(in the first week) and is dropping every day even though the datasets are updated now and they gave me access to the webservices.

also their app doesn't show the timetables( like you would see in the busstops )

I made this app because there was no way to access the data on a mobile phone and just wanted to help out people like me(students)

Most shops close at 18:00, supermarkets at 20:00 (oh wait, 21:00 on Friday!), practically everything is closed on Sunday. On top of that, some shops close around lunchtime for an hour or two (so no quick shopping during the lunch break). The main argument for having regulations on opening hours is to 'protect' the small shop-owners. It seems this group is able to dictate practically all the economic policy in Belgium. Other examples: the regulation of sales, the restrictions on building malls,... Now the small shops are all great when you are a stay-at-home mom/dad who has all the time in the world to get bread, vegetables,... but for the majority of people in full-time jobs, shopping is a very stressful matter because there are only a few times when you can go (i.e. sacrificing your Saturday). If you want to cook a decent meal with fresh ingredients, you have to leave work at 16:00 to get everything. This makes no sense, economic, social or even healthwise. So when will Belgians stand up and demand longer opening hours?

I don't like sounding like a nag, but seriously: what happened to the website of our train company? On my computer, trying to find out the best route from A to B is now extremely slow. When I type in the first letter of my departure town, my CPU-speed skyrockets and delays all the computing until finally a dropdown box appears with all possible places that start with that one letter (including streetnames and all little details).

I use a Debian-box with Google Chrome, I have noticed that it doesn't go too bad on Windows computers with an update version of Firefox, but it clearly goes wrong with Chrome. Does anybody else have troubles with the website? This is not a anti-linux post or something, I really believe that the NMBS uses a script that just doesn't get handled well by my browser and it really is a pain.

I have now found the [old version](http://hari.b-rail.be/HAFAS/bin/query.exe/en) of the ""trainplanner"" and there even is a great [mobile version](http://hari.b-rail.be/hari3/webserver1/bin/query.exe/eox?ld=&amp;searchMode=NORMAL), they really are a breeze, love 'em, but the new standard one is just hell.

Am I the only one that thinks this isn't a temporary measure?,Ghasran,24,2,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/n9iv0/belgian_government_tries_to_get_200_million_in/,"I'm a freelance software consultant and as such I've had my company supply me with a car to get to my clients. Recently Di Rupo proposed to raise the taxes on company cars to generate an extra 200 million euro for the Belgium government. Judging by the calculations I've made using the published formula (car price incl. VAT and excl. promotions * CO² * 6/7), the new taxes I'll have to pay to be allowed to drive my company car will not only be double, but triple the amount of what I'm paying now.

This isn't something to be taken lightly as this will impact people's budget, buying ability and car choosing behavior. It stands to reason that this will also impact the Belgian economy as leasing companies and car manufactures are going to be victimized.

To me personally, this doesn't seem to be a well thought through measure to allow the government generate extra income on long term. It's more like a shortcut where they hit an untapped resource with guerrilla tactics. The fact that they calculate the tax using the price of the car INCLUDING VAT, just makes me feel like they are ripping me off. Like the government thinks we're too stupid to notice that we're charged 21% on top of the car's price for VAT and that very same 21% will then again be used in the formula to calculate the new taxes!?

I understand that everyone needs to chip in during the fight to keep our country financially healthy during the crisis. I also understand that having a company car was an extremely nice bonus on top of a salary and that this seemed unfair to others without company cars. Therefore I'm more than willing to pay an increased tax for the privilege of having a company car. If only they'd give me an indication that they'd actually thought about it instead of just inventing some formula that looks like it was conceived in some federal private ""fat-cat"" meeting during a round of ""Why we love to dump on the middle and lower class"" stand-up comedy.

Judging from what I read in the newspapers, the changes to the taxes regarding company cars impact 350 000 employees in Belgium. And as time moves on it seems this tax will effectively be introduced starting from 1st January 2012. I'm guessing this will simply be something we're going to have to live with until the government has their 200 million. 

Or is it?

I think that they're going to get used to getting this extra money from company cars and that this tax is here to stay. This isn't some measure in time of need, this is taking advantage of the current crisis and using it as an excuse to change the way company cars are taxed for the second time in 3 years. Or am I wrong? Is there still a glimpse of hope and sanity in the future or will we all have to bend to the will of our fake democracy?

I follow the news on the [California Proposition 19](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_19_(2010)) and was wondering what the current parties in Belgium thought about legalisation of cannabis. I send them all an e-mail why this would help our economy and current drug-problem (regularization, police force can concentrate on other things, huge economy input, better controlling of addicts and quality of the drug, killing down the illegal market, cannabis isn't a gateway drug, less addictive then coffee, alcohol,...). And this is a short tl;dr

* Groen!
&gt; They agree with almost everything I told them and said they want to make cannabis legal.
* Vlaams Belang
&gt; Ignored a couple of studies I send them and responded with older studies (from 1997 etc) and wanted to make the small doses again illegal and want to put more resources into drug-prevention.
* N-VA
&gt; Want to make it illegal again and more resources into drug-prevention. Ignored almost everything I said in my huge e-mail and I received an e-mail that seemed to be pre-made.
* CD&amp;V
&gt; Responded back with a huge e-mail, talking about everything I said in my e-mail and tried to respond as honest as possible. Still they are against the legalization and ignored some parts of my e-mail how I described that the legalization would decrease criminalization and usage.
* SP-A
&gt; Same as N-VA, send me some sort pre-made e-mail but they do want to keep a low-profile for drugs-prevention.

So, from all the parties that are currently in the Flemish government only one wants to legalize cannabis (Groen!). The rest are more against it (Vlaams Belang most). I thank all parties of responding in their best but I am disappointed of SP-A and NV-A for not giving back a real good response and more a response to the subject I gave my e-mail and ignoring the rest.

For the respond time, Groen! only needed a couple of hours. Vlaams-Belang needed 3 days. N-VA needed 4 days. CD&amp;V needed 6 days and SP-A took 7 days to respond. But in their defense I send my e-mail on a Friday around 2:00 PM.

I have send a new e-mail to all parties with my respond to their e-mail (or their not-respond) and I will keep you guys up-to-date.

You can always send an e-mail yourself if you have any questions about any party their view on anything. I see too many people these days complaining about everything and how the politics are doing everything wrong but they do not want to spend 5 minutes with just sending an e-mail to that party with their complain? 

**Edit #1**
I have send an e-mail to every French party in the current [senate](http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/index_senate&amp;MENUID=11500&amp;LANG=nl). I have also noticed that Open-VLD has not responded to my mail yet (On 10/09/2010 I have send all Flemish parties my e-mail). I have also noticed a couple of spelling errors and now I feel ashamed :-( I should proof-read my e-mails!

**Edit #2**
If you want to send an e-mail yourself (I advise you to do this, be active in your country and you can actually change things) here is a [list of all parties in senate](http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/index_senate&amp;MENUID=18400&amp;LANG=nl) or [list of e-mails from everyone in the senate](http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/index_senate&amp;MENUID=18300&amp;LANG=nl) or their phone-number or you just contact them on their official website (I did it this way)

And I'm not talking about tv shows, but at least the tv news and good dutch/french speaking movies in both languages?


TV news could be co-hosted by one host in each language, or even by bilingual hosts, that would be simply amazing to switch language for every topic!
Dutch movies subtitled in french (and the opposite), original english versions subtitled in both languages (as they do at the theater), I would watch that every single night! :)


Flemish tv at least broadcasts movies in original english version with nl subtitles, while the french speaking channels just broadcast the silly french versions of every single ""foreign"" movie.


I think bilingual (or even multi-lingual) tv channels would definitely help our children being more open on other languages in their early years...


As far as I know, the only events hosted in both languages are Eurovision and Miss Belgium (although I didn't watch them for a couple of years, so I don't even know if it's still the case).

Are there any program on any channel that are still broadcasted in their non-native language?
Are you aware of any initiative that would have been tried in that direction?

I love living in Belgium, don't get me wrong. But after all these years one my mine gripes with .be is Belgiums sliced bread. Two problems (which are related):

1. The slices are way too thin to make a descent sandwich, meaning, if you put anything else then Nutella between two slices, like for instance cheese+mayo+cucumber, it will be soggy and/or collapse. Forget about something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/H6hMM.jpg)

2. The bread gets stale really quick. Like within a day. This is I think one of the reasons you will find bread vending machines all over Belgium (and not in many other countries, besides France). Bread just doesn't last till the next day and gets dry/stale quick. I think the reasons Belgium bread gets stale quick are:
   
   - They don't let the dough rise long enough (this also as an effect on the taste, which I don't like)
   - The bread has a very soft crust, which I suspect doesn't protect freshness much either
   - Bread is sliced to thin, more surface means more water can escape
   - They use paper-bags for packaging which are not air-tight

Is this some trick so the backers sell more bread, or is this the kind of bread Belgiums just love to eat?

Now I'm moving to Belgium to attend the Royal Brussels Conservatory to get another Bachelor's. Now that it's all pretty much set in stone I would really appreciate any advice you guys would have for someone like me.

Thankfully I have a friend who owns an apartment on the outskirts of Antwerp so rent is extremely cheap. We came in Wednesday and are leaving Wednesday. 

My girlfriend and I have been steadily working on our Dutch using Rosetta Stone, Babbel, and Memrise. I've noticed the Antwerpen dialect is much different than the proper ""Dutch Dutch"" as my friend calls it. What advice would you offer us in regards to learning the language? Are there any helpful phrases that we should be inclined to learn? What is the proper way to use ""alstublieft""? Initially I thought it was a ""you're welcome"" but having been to the bar and some restaurants we find that before we can even say ""dank u"" the server will say ""alstublieft"". I guess we should start learning French too seeing how Brussels has far more French than we were expecting.

We promised friends back home that we would bring them back chocolates. What is a decent store to go to where we won't spent a ton of cash? Yesterday we went to the Carrefour market down the block from us and picked up a box of GuyLian shells for 5,xx and they seemed pretty good but that's by our standards.

What is the job market like here and what are the chances of us getting ""student"" jobs? Do schools over here normally have jobs specifically for students to make some cash? 

I had a lot more to ask but I can't remember, I'm sure this will be a good starting point. Thanks in advance! =)",,False,,t5_2qhe6,False,,,True,t3_1hczju,http://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/1hczju/im_an_american_moving_to_antwerp_for_school_in/,

What should I know?",Lost_in_Thought,20,1,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/1bkyje/hello_rbelgium_im_an_expat_in_the_states_and_want/,"I moved with my family to the states in 95 when I was a wee lad of 6. I kept up my Belgian identity as long as I could, but more and more I feel like I'm losing it. Problem. I is, I don't feel entirely American, either. I still feel like a foreigner here, despite being naturalized. 

So, after a failed stint at college and now having a job that I can't support myself with, I figured I would never have a better opportunity to move back. My dutch is ok, but should improve with time and practice. I can read and write, though not very well at all. I have a lot of family, and family friends, who are willing to help me out if I move. 

I've already known for a while that if I stay in the States I can never start a family, since I will never be able to give my kids good opportunities. I'll also probably die alone, penniless, and sick, the way things are here. Also, every time I visit it just feels like home. 

So, what should I know about the state of Belgium before I make such a momentous leap of faith? Are there any good dutch language podcasts (not the Netherlands dutch, I need something where people don't talk with a candy in their mouth) that you know of, any free dutch reading/writing courses online I could take? 

I hope to have the funds to move within a year. It's hard to save money, yo. Thanks for your time and help! 

PS: I have class and work, so I may not respond for some time.

Edit: thanks for all the help, ladies and gents.

After almost 17 years here I'm, pretty much, immune to the various bizarre antics of some drivers in Brussels (Belgian or otherwise)

However, one particular habit has always bothered me and I was wondering if any natives could explain if there's a good reason for it.

At crossroads (particularly traffic-light controlled ones), why do most drivers block the junction thereby preventing the cars coming from the other part of the junction from crossing?  Is it a cultural thing or is this convention simply not taught when learning to drive?  Is is just pure ignorance/arrogance/selfishness?

As a Brit we are taught that you simply don't continue across a junction unless you can completely cross it.  There are even road markings (a striped yellow square) on a lot of these junctions (we call them ""box junctions"") to show, quite clearly, that you should not stop anywhere within said yellow square.  

I don't want this to turn into yet another ""we expats think you Belgians can't drive"" discussion (I'm sick of arguing against the ""Priorite a droit"" rule!) as I'm sure it's not just Belgians that do this.  

I'm just curious as to why this particular quirk is so prevalent, particularly in Brussels",,False,,t5_2qhe6,False,,,True,t3_1anhky,http://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/1anhky/belgian_driving_habits_at_crossroads/,

.

__________________________________________________________________________
.

**It has been decided: meetup Wednesday 27/03/2013 at [Waterhuis aan de Bierkant](http://www.waterhuisaandebierkant.be/) , around 19u30 on the first floor!** 

**[Reddit Gifts link](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/gent-meetup-1/)** 

**Make an account and sign up for the event: this way we can keep track of how many people are coming, so we can ask for less/more room in the café!**

**See ya there!** 

.

__________________________________________________________________________

.

**How to get in Ghent:**

Train is your best bet. Depending on where we will go, either Gent-St.Pieters or Gent-Dampoort will be your get-out point. Neither station is close to city center, so you might want to check out the buses (see www.delijn.be) 

.


**Sleeping arrangements**

Some people might only come if they have a place to sleep. In the past Leuven meetups, redditors helped out other redditors by offering a place to sleep. I hope the /r/gent community can show the same kindness!

Please leave a message in the comment section if you have some spare room to stuff a redditor into. Rember: redditors are like cats: if they fits, they sits (and sleeps). I have a very small room, but I think I can fit in 1 person (maybe 2 with some creativity :P - first choice for the redditors from Leuven who offered me and the other guys some place to sleep!)

.

**In the comment section you will also find people offering up places!**

From the results of the last post, it seemed like it would be best to have a meet-up after school is back in session, so I've decided we should have the meet-up on Sunday, the 17th. That seems to be the most popular option for everyone else, and I shouldn't have trouble returning from Amsterdam by the evening. This is early for a reminder of course, but I wanted to ensure everyone knew that the meet-up is not this weekend, or at least everyone who could've made it this weekend.

For anyone who wanted to hang out before then, I'd still love to! I will now arrive this Wednesday (6/2) instead due to a delay with my visa. I've got my visa in hand, though, and nothing is going to keep me out of your country now! I'll try to sort through the mess of comments in the last thread and get in touch with everyone who volunteered to hang out. If you didn't catch me before/I miss contacting you and you still want to hang out, just let me know!

EDIT: Still need to decide the place and time, so let's work together on that. Also, I hear there will be fun hats, so bring 'em if you've got 'em.

EDIT 2: (because I never get things right the first time): Here's the Redditgifts link for the meet-up! Please RSVP!

This great community keeps on growing... Since October last year the number of unique visitors for this reddit has doubled.

In relation with this growth, I have been receiving a lot of user feedback lately. So after some back and forth, I have decided it would be wise to create a few rules &amp; guidelines to keep everything fun &amp; positive for everyone. 

I have been postponing to ""regulate"" this reddit as long as possible, but I think the time has come for some basic directives.

I'm not that fond of too much regulation myself so I have tried to keep everything very **basic &amp; simple**. 

It pretty much comes down to one thing: **don't be an asshole**. Easy, right?

As a visitor of /r/Belgium, you can easily spot our rules in the sidebar.

I also started using reddit's wiki system to set up an /r/Belgium **[wiki page](/r/belgium/wiki/index)**, which also contains a handy list of related subreddits. If you want to add your own subreddit to this list, please contact me!

Offcourse, these rules are *not* set in stone so I totally welcome everyone's suggestions! 

Let me know what you guys think!

Thanks!

---------------------------------------------------------------

**TLDR**. I laid out some rules for this subreddit. It all boils down to **don't be an asshole**

I posted this to /r/Brussels with no luck, so hopefully you guys can help me out. 

I sincerely apologize if this has been posted before. My boyfriend (u/dsgn09 in case he posts here) and I may be moving to Brussels in the fall! We are from the United States, more specifically we are from Tennessee, and we've never been out of the country. So this is a huge and exciting step for us.  We're in our early 20s, and both pursuing a Masters degree at an English speaking University (I in International Relations, he in Public Policy). 

Of course my parents would like for me to get over there before accepting my admission and we are hoping to make it to Belgium for our Spring Break, but logistically speaking, getting our passports in time and finding affordable plane tickets is going to be tough. Until then, I can only use the Internet to get a feel as to whether or not Brussels will be a good fit, which I'm sure it will be. However, planning an international move without even knowing the place is a little scary. This is where you lovely redditors can come in. :)


My questions: 

* 1) Where's the best place to look for a place to rent online? Craigslist prices seem too good to be true. Are prices per week or month if it's not specified--I've seen it both ways. Also, a more specific question for the Brussels inhabitants: which area should we look into renting? Are utilities normally included? 
 
* 2) How expensive is living in the city--food, utilities, basic expenses. It seems relatively cheaper than other European cities like London and Paris. I just don't want to get too blown out of the water expecting one level of expense and get slammed with double.
 
* 3) Is Brussels a good place to live? If we can't make it before moving, I at least need some reassurance. I've heard that travel in Europe is relatively easy, does that mean I can realistically just pop over to another city or country for the weekend? Also, is the public transportation reliable/decent because we will not be bringing our cars over with us. 
 
* 4) I know zero Dutch, and while I've been taking French classes for the last 4 years, I completely suck at it, and I truly pity anybody who has to hear me speak it. Everywhere says I can get away with mostly English, at least in Brussels, but culturally speaking, am I going to be screwed? 
 
If you can think of any more information that would be helpful for us, I'd really appreciate it. We are excited about this potential move, and I'm truly grateful for any advice you're willing to give, because I'll be honest, I'm scared to death, but I'm also really excited. Once again, sorry if this is posted all the time.

I am the founder and president of this club.
And if you are a Belgian and have a beard  
you can become a founding member of **the first official Belgian Bearding Club**!  
  
*The first? But Roel, there already are 2 Belgian clubs [recognised by the WBMA](http://wbma.whiskerclub.org/newmembersE2.html).*  
That statement is correct... but those are ""mustache clubs"",  
so Belgium is lacking a full(er) facial hair club!  
  
So why exactly do you want to start a club Roel?  
Simple: to join the WBMA and eventually maybe even  
host [the World Bearding Championships](http://www.worldbeardchampionships.com/) in Belgium!  
  
*What do you need exactly?*  
-Well, first of all: no money. The club will be non-profit, always!  
-(Potentially) nice beards. So even if you're under 3cm you can join, if you are willing to commit.  
-People who are engaged to commit to the cause  
(become a WBMA-club / win medals for the team / host the world championships).  
  
*Okay, I'm in, what do I need to do?*

I don't understand what the point is of blowing up bridges with other countries that indeed have things in commen and affirm their diplomatic relations. 

As a flemish Belgian I am ashamed that the biggest flemish party wants to blow up bridges with other cultures. Other countries who are a member of la francophonie include countries like Switzerland. Even an independent Flanders I think would benefit from being a member of La Francophonie. Denying that we have important historical ties with the French language (and still have: e.g Brussels and Flemish belt around Brussels) I see this as very provocative, antagonistic and closeminded. Belgium has always been open to international relations, denying this even in an independent Flanders would be revisionistic and stupid. 

As a Flemish Belgian living abroad I would be very much ashamed of my home country (be it Belgium or Flanders) if it starts to close down on itself and become an asocial isolated nation.

I am coming as an exchange student to Leuven in mid-September to study for a year at KUL. I am super excited and can't wait to finally get there. Now, I have talked to a couple of cool Belgian students who were here on exchange so I have some general idea of what to expect. However, our conversation was quite some time ago and I didn't have many specific questions that I have now. Some of the questions might seem silly but I would really appreciate if my fellow redditors could help me out with any info.

1) Is Belgium really as awesome and fascinating as I expect it to be?

2) I will be flighting in to Brussels around 9am on a weekday and plan to take a train to Leuven right from the airport. Is this the easiest way to get to Leuven from Brussels?

3) I believe I will have some temporary accommodation at KUL for a week or so.  How long (on average) does it take to find an apartment? Do you call it ""an apartment"" or ""a flat""? Do you recommend having flat mates or get a studio for my self? What are rent prices on average for each? Are utilities usually included, if not how much then? How many month deposit is required to be paid ahead? 

4) What are some good areas of Leuven to look for a place to live in? Some description would help: nice, quite, rowdy, far from everything or party central. What are some of the areas I should stay away from? 

5) Does your wall plug have two circular wholes? 220V?

6) Are the university (workout) gyms any good? Is there a swimming pool? What about jogging trails? Do people do morning jogs or am I going to be ""that-Canadian-guy-who-runs-around-the-streets""?

7) Is a bike useful, as in should I rent/buy one?

8) What do male students wear to class? bar? clubs? Dress pants or jeans? Dress shoes or runners?

9) What is the general attitude toward international students? Please be honest here :D What about Canadians?

10) I've heard of download limits in Leuven. Are they everywhere or could it be possible to have a no limit internet at my apartment? What are the rules for downloading copyright movies and music like in Belgium?

11) What about cell phones? who are the cheapest/best guys? Should i get a plan or pay for minutes? How much does this cost?

12) Now, this is probably the most important question for me: Is a budget of 1000 EUR a month will be enough??? Will I be able to eat in well, go to bars, pay for rent? Is this more than enough? Or will I have to live and eat at min? What amount  should I budget for? Keep in mind that I'm really down to earth.

13) Does anyone want for me to bring anything from Canada?

14) Is school really hard and has heavy study loads? Is there anything you think I should know?......

Again, I would really appreciate any information you could provide. Thank you.

so I am German but live in Belgium for 15 years now. I have followed todays events on TV (een) and have seen our new king giving his oath in French, Vlamish and German. 

Now you ask yourself: ""Yes, great but why do I need to know this?"" Well, because I just watched a German programm on ""ARD"" (main German channel) on our new king and the oathing. The funny part was that they only showed Filip giving his oath in German and then discussing what a **great sign of peace this is regarding the disputes between Flandres and Wallonia this was.**

I was surprised by how much bullshit the main German channel (which is run by the state) can talk and having ""experts"" discuss it.

 * Are government services (schools, health care, etc) available in both languages across the country? Are there French schools deep in the Flemish part of the country?
 * Are people encouraged to speak French if they live in the French part, and Flemish in the Flemish part?
 * Is one language spoken by more people than the other language? Are the minority language speakers scared of being crowded out by the other language?

I've noticed that back in my native West-Flanders, everyone I know speaks the local West-Flemish. I know people from the three corners (Bruges, de Westhoek, Kortrijkse) so I'm pretty sure most people in West-Flanders speak their dialect.

Now I've moved closer to my inlaws. Over here, I haven't even *heard* a dialect. Everyone speaks Algemeen Nederlands with an accent. I'm sure you can say that ""this is the dialect"", but my mother-in-law insists that I wouldn't understand ""plat Brabants"". Haven't heard it yet.

So, I'm wondering: do you speak a dialect at home, or a recognised language? Do you ever speak dialect? Do you even know a (real) dialect? And ofcourse, the general area you're from.

Her grandmother now has Alzheimer's and has lived here for over 50 years so she is tough to get accurate information from.

Apparently next year on/around Remembrance Day there is a walk of remembrance in the Knokkee area. 

My wife would love for us to go.... we aren't exactly rich so I was wondering if anyone here had some tips on nice places that we could stay that are not outrageously priced.
I love to be able to surprise her with this trip (she thinks it would be nice but doesn't expect us to go since it would be so expensive).

We would probably go for a week and want to tour the areas around Knokkee. I will obviously try to get more information about specific areas. 

I guess I'm looking for things like:

Does Belgium have all inclusive resorts? Or is that just a Caribbean thing. IF they do not have all inclusive(s) what can one expect to spend on food for a week? How expensive is it to visit Belgium?

Most of the travel sites around here won't let me book or price check for next November yet, but from comparing against this Novemebers prices it looks like about $2000 Canadian for the flight and hotel and a car for the week (per person). With a year to save for it thats doable, but I'm looking for a rough guesstimate of what everything else will cost and where/what we should visit.

I've found, even if someone doesn't know very much English at all, they'll know how to say this.

The topic comes up amongst friends and coworkers on a regular basis. We call it getting ""belgian'd"". It doesn't matter if we're in a store, eating at a restaurant, on the phone with someone from the electric company, talking to our landlord, or even the police. The response we get more times then not to any question or request is typically, ""that is not possible"".

I was explaining this to a Belgian friend the other day and he asked me why we all thought it was funny. He noticed we always laugh when we hear someone say it. He didn't understand what other response would be more appropriate. I explained to him it's kind of rude to tell someone their request is simply ""impossible"", and leaving it at that. I gave him several examples like, ""That won't work, but how about this?"", ""I don't think we can do that, but let me check"", or ""I can't do that, but let me see if someone else knows how"". 

He understood what I was getting at. He never uses the lines himself, so his opinion was it's just what some people do when they're not good with English, and they're trying to get rid of whoever they're talking to. lol

Anyone one else hear this quite a bit?

**EDIT:** I brought this up last night to my girlfriend, who is bilingual (Spanish &amp; English), and she said I'd most likely get the same type of response from a Spanish speaker. She basically just said not to read into it too much. The person isn't intending to be rude, they just most likely don't feel the need to explain themselves. I pointed out to her I'm specifically talking about situations involving customer service, but she just reminds me I'm not in America anymore. lol

**EDIT #2:** After talking to a few more locals, I've got a better understanding of why this happens so much.

**Postponed indefinitely, new date TBA**

Okay, so here's the details for the meetup. 

Meet is set around 8pm in Café De Planck in Gent (Opposite Kinepolis Gent, it's the boat). 

for those coming by car, your best bet is to park in the underground parking of the Sint-Pietersplein and walk from there. From the Sint-Pieterplein, you basically take the first street to the left, heading down towards the water (Kantienberg), then take the first right (Ter Platen) and the boat will be on your right. 

For those coming by public transport, your best bet is the train to Gent-Sint-Pieters and then any of the buses with nubmbers in the 70's. you can take those buses at the 2 small bus stops (NOT the big bus station) at the rear of the station (where all the construction is going on). Get out at the ""Terplatenbrug"" stop and walk from there. 

If anyone needs more specific details, feel free to PM me.

As luck would have it, I will be in Brussels for the Beer Festival on Sept. 1-2!  I am an avid beer lover and home brewer.  I grew up in the foothills of the North Carolina mountains where brewing your own beer was the best way to get it.  I lived in a dry county, meaning beer was only sold in grocery stores, never in restaurants, and there were no bars.

I eventually moved to the capitol city for an education.  But even there, until 2005, there was a cap of 5% on the ABV for beer in NC. The best beer available was Heineken (ugh!).  When the law was finally overturned, I got my first taste of a Belgian beer.  It was Chimay Cinq Cents, and it was glorious!

Since then I have endeavored to find places that sold and imported Belgian beer in the US.  I have some favorites beers, all of which I believe will be in attendance: St. Bernardus, Malheur, and Maredsous are at the top the of the list.

I'm extremely excited about attending the beer weekend!  My only regret is that my wife and friends are not able to attend; and there is nothing worse than drinking alone, especially with excitement I have!!  
I have never been to Europe.  I don't speak French, Dutch, or German (some Spanish).  Are there any English speaking redditors that will be there?  Any business travelers like myself that would like to meet up for a few beers?  First round is on me!

tl;dr - Going alone to Belgian Beer Weekend, want to share a beer.

Please share your opinions and advice with me!

**Some specific questions:**  

1. Oude Markt looks pretty intense! Is the social atmosphere of Leuven generally dominated by 16-22 year olds clubbing and drinking hard, or is there also a good scene for older students to meet, relax, and enjoy some culture? (I love to party, but sometimes I also like to be sober enough to carry on a conversation once in a while...)
2. How's the Belgian live music scene? Local art scene? Local intellectual scene? Are student special-interest clubs open to non-students in the community?
3. I don't speak Dutch (yet). How much will this isolate me in the beginning? How big/accessible is the international community?
4. What do you love/hate the most about life in Leuven?
5. In terms of culture &amp; social atmosphere, how would you compare life in Leuven/Brussels to other parts of Europe?. (i.e. friendly people, tight community, good music, good food, architecture, natural beauty, etc)

I find it a bit discriminating that lots of those articles are one sided.

Could it also be that we (as I am myself a Flemish Belgian) are more influenced by the large internet presence of people from the Netherlands? Or is it the lack of popular Belgian forums whereas the Walloons are more connected to the actual French people and thus go to French internet websites?

IMO we should say 'Dutch' and then Flemish is more a variant of Dutch with the 'dialects'.

But on the other hand what are we then? Dutch or Flemish people?
I this case I think we should use the word Flemish, cause Dutchmen is more for the people in The Netherlands.

Turns out that you can only get this support if you are unemployed and getting unemployment pay.

It comes down to this: you have a job? Good on you, but if you want this degree you are gonna have to do it at night and on your free days (and pay for the whole thing yourself).

You don't have a job? Even better! Let us pay you to go to class during the day. You got a job offer? Don't bother with it, just go to school and we will keep paying you. Not enough for you? Don't worry we will help you pay half of the tuition.

Upon crossing a street, a car bumped into me, and while not hurt, I was taken back.  

I scolded the driver for not paying attention.  While I was turning around, I lost my balance and took the driver's side window of the car for balance.  I broke the window, and in the heat of the moment, for one reason or another, I walked off.  

The cops arrested me shortly thereafter and put me through the system, initially giving me a 'proces verbal' for being drunk in public.  Today, though, I received a letter from the police saying I needed to go to a 'audtion' for the charge of 'distruction of a car window.'  

As I've never been charged with anything in my life and I am not Belgian, I have no clue what are the consequences or what happens next.  Any advice?   Ideally, I just want to make this go away, with as little as fuss as possible.  

For a bit more information, I'm not an EU national but I have been living and working here for a really long time.   Also, this is a throw-away account, for obivious reasons.

I see many policemen and women on the streets and although they don’t really bother me (for now), I’m rather paranoid and I would like to know what the law says they can do to other people: e.g. search what, who, how, where, with or without a warrant, on private or public property, etc. I’m genuinely interested because I’m pretty sure some cops would gladly abuse this and lie in order to get “evidence” against innocent people, although I’m sure most of them won’t do that without provocation.

Most importantly, I would like to know if, like in the USA, I have the right to remain silent, and if cops can detain me without arresting me on the grounds of “reasonable suspicion”.

I’ve heard I had to carry ID at all times, I do it reluctantly so as not to have to sit 24h in jail and get a fine, but what other obligations do I have as a Belgian citizen?

Please refrain from “I’ve heard that”, cite the law, I don’t really know where to find it apart from the Moniteur’s website and their search engine sucks (and I’m not a law student so I don’t know much and I’m pretty sure I would misunderstand some stuff).

Or would it be better to split my time between the two e.g. three nights in each?  I'm primarily interested in beer and getting a feel for the local atmosphere vs overtly ""touristy"" stuff.

I also really want to see the Cantillon brewery in Brussels...doable in a day trip from one of those cities?  Or would it be better to spend a night in Brussels as well?

I just realized this little community has its fair share of geeks/techies in it so I would greatly value your advice. I work for a small Belgian web start-up (from Ghent, specifically) that's planning on growing fast. The thing is, we're having a surprisingly hard time finding new developers for our team. So far we posted a job post on our company web site and on linkedIn, using the obvious social media channels to point our network and fans/followers/... to it. We had some response, but as I said, not nearly as much as we had hoped for.

I know there are various 'job fares' being organised by universities, but I went to one of those for recruiting in the past and it didn't have a very good return for the considerable time, money and effort these things tend to cost.

So, any fellow tech start-up people in here? And if so, what are some of the good places you used to find awesome web developers you know of? Wacky, out-of-the-box ideas are welcome too of course :-)

P.S.: [this](http://engagor.com/jobs/)(on our site) and [this](http://www.linkedin.com/jobs?viewJob=&amp;jobId=2456185&amp;trk=jobs_biz_pub) (on LinkedIn) is the exact job description, we've speculated that something may be wrong with the wording so any feedback on that would be great too of course. But I don't intend this as a pitch by any means, this is of course not a job board.

I am assuming that landlords prefer to negotiate with people located in their own country instead of people who live 6.000km away.

Every one was so friendly and the country is a thing of beauty. Great beers, great food and a great atmosphere. I asked you guys where I should visit and you gave me some do's and don'ts and we had an amazing time. If you saw a group of 20-something year old Irish students walking around Brussels with with backpacks and looking lost, its was most likely us. 

First we visited the Cantillon brewery and tried some of their beers. It was a great experience and the staff were beyond welcoming to us. Then we set off to try and get into the city center. We saw a bus going in the right direction and we tried to ask the bus driver where he was going etc, but our broken French and his lack of English was very hard to understand, which is when one of the people at the bus stop about to get on the bus started talking to the bus driver in French, and then back to us in English. Instead of getting on his bus, he walked us across town, over to the Metro station, and put us on a train. He told another person on the train to tell us when to get off and he left. Sure enough, the other passenger told us when to get off and there we were, in the heart of Brussels. Your people are so kind and helpful. We can't begin to thank you enough. 

We found our way to the Grand Place and had some waffles with chocolate and then tried to find Delirium Cafe. It took us 30 mins, and several people showing us where to go, until we finally found it down a lovely little alley way. This is such an amazing little bar. I know some people here said it was very touristy there, but it was a good place for us to start. The beer was fantastic (not to mention the free beer we got because it was the end of the barrel) and the atmosphere was really relaxed. The staff there were so passionate about the beer they had and they were so helpful. I must have had 6 or 7 different beers and sampled about 10 more. You guys really know how to make beer. 

After some steak at a small restaurant, we found USE-IT and found out about a band from Barcelona who were playing a small gig nearby. Once we found the place, it looked like it wasn't even a bar, as they had no taps, just a fridge 1.50 beer. There must have been 30 people there, but everyone welcomed us as we sang and danced with the Spanish band upstairs. It was fantastic. 

They are only some of the highlights of the trip, and I'm sure we won't forget this trip for a very long time. 

Thanks Belgium, you guys are awesome!

I got a job offer from a company in Brussels, however I don't know whether to accept since the taxes are so high!. I'm not sure how much I will have at the end of each month to spend that's why I'm kindly asking for your help. The package they are offering is the following


Monthly gross salary: 2300 Euro
a 13th month's pay in 2012 prorated in accordance with the worked months in 2012
Mobility package: 450 Euro gross per month
Representation allowance: 115 Euro net per month
Lunch allowance: 12,5 Euro net per day (max 4x/week)
Call budget mobile phone: 56 Euro per month.

At the end this makes around 37,700 eur a year. The question is, the tax rate applies only to the yearly gross salary (2,300*12= 27,600) or to the yearly amount (salaries + Benefits)? 

A lot of people have told me to use the online calculator but it's only either dutch, french or german (i don't speak any of them except from basic french) on top of that, it is not intuitive at all

I'm currently a Mobile Vikings customer. I have been for over a year now, and I'm growing tired of my slow mobile internet.

My time is spent between the cities of Liège (primarily), Leuven, Roeselare and Durbuy, and I can barely retrieve my e-mails in most of these cities. I generally don't use up my 2000 texts, but I usually run out of mobile internet and/or call minutes before the end of the month.

I know Proximus has a much faster network, and since I seem to reload my MV card more than once a month (making the 15€ a month moot), I figured I'd look into it.

From what I understand, MV and Proximus Generation Connect both offer 2GBs of mobile internet and they're both prepaid, but MV offers 1000 texts to other MV customers, and 1000 to other networks, and Proximus offers 2000 to all networks. MV offers 60 call minutes whereas Proximus offers 80.

What else should I know? Is it worth switching over to Proximus, or perhaps Mobistar (since the Base network isn't all that)? The 5€ difference bothers me a little, but considering I find myself recharging twice a month already, mostly for mobile internet, I guess it's worth asking.

EDIT: After reading all your comments I'm heavily leaning towards Proximus. I'm not a fan of Belgacom, but Mobile Vikings clearly isn't working for me, data-wise or coverage-wise. Topping up online isn't what I'd choose but it's better than nothing. I'll let you guys know if I notice a difference in quality.

I'm not driving, and therefore have to get to Leuven from Brussels via public transport.  In order to minimize my commuting time, I wanted to live close to (bike ride distance) from Gare du Nord or Gare du Midi. I've not been happy with what's on offer in these locations so far. The houses we have seen seem to be in dangerous neighborhoods? Also: we'd like to meet people and not tuck ourselves away somewhere far away. 

Can any redditors suggest any nice neighborhoods, or even nice streets, in Brussels do that I can get to Leuven easily using public transport?

TL;DR: working in Leuven, need advice on good Brussels neighborhoods to live in.

Any help appreciated! Thanks! ",,False,,t5_2qhe6,False,,,True,t3_tjlpx,http://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/tjlpx/advice_needed_on_brussels_neighborhoods/,

A friend of mine fell in love with Westmalle trappist beer a while ago.  Difficulty: We can't get them in Canada and I want to surprise him with it.  Here's where you come in.  

If you live reasonably close to [Westmalle abbey](http://www.trappistwestmalle.be/en/page/brouwerij.aspx), could you pick some up for me and ship it here?  It seems that the Abbey is not open to the general public so maybe it isn't possible at all.  :(

I'm really excited that Westvleteren coulf be available here in April, too but my friend's favourite is Westmalle.  

I will happily pay your expenses up front plus pay you a little just for being AWESOME.  You will of course also have my heartfelt gratitude.  I'm a student in university here so if the overall cost is too high, I will have to wait until some future time when I can afford it.  

Can someone please give me an idea of how possible this is and also how expensive it might become?  

Hey I just had an idea!  If you want, we might be able to drink ""with"" you live via skype.  Might be fun!  We are on the west coast of Canada so maybe 13:00 here, 22:00 there?  Just an idea.

I have a German friend who doesn't know belgian beers. She tried a Delirium Tremens a few weeks ago and liked it, I told her I would bring her some fine beers for her to taste.

I have bought:

- Hoegaarden Grand Cru

- Affligem Tripel

- Saint Feuillien Grand Cru

- Chimay Grande Réserve (bleue)

- Omer

- La Trappe Quadrupel
 

Thing is, I'm not a beer expert myself, and I don't know what the optimal order would be to get the most out of those beers.

I think we will drink no more than 2 or 3 beers at a time (like in one evening) to avoid loosing out on flavours.

So if some connoisseurs could give me some advice for a degustation of these beers, in batches of 2 or 3, that would be grand!

Here are the 'facts':

* Lived in the place for 14 month and we're now moved out. 
* The lease is registered with the city.
* We gave notice (via email) on Jan 29 that we want to leave on April 30th. Landlord deems this an insufficient period of time for the notice (less than 3 months) and threatens with 2 months indemnity (since it's after first year).
* An expert visited when we moved in and out. 
* We cooperate with finding a new tenant and one is found to move in a day after we leave. Landlord had verbally agreed to ""charge very little"" of the indemnity if we cooperate like this.
* Upon move out, the expert verbally told me the place is clean and no more than 2-3 hours of cleaning may be assessed (at 20-30eu/hr). I review the experts findings before he leaves (landlord wasn't there) and consider it reasonable. I sign nothing (unfortunately?) After the landlord meets with the expert, a total of 390euro of cleaning is assessed.
* Also included in the assessment is wood floor treatment for 499 euro that was not performed while we were there nor before. He offered to have it done for us but we never actually needed it and never scheduled to have it done. The floor was in same condition when we arrived as when we left.
* I asked the landlord to remove the wood treatment and to reduce the cleaning. He replies that there's no negotiation and it's take it or leave it. He's threatening to go to court and to pursue in addition the two months indemnity that he is not otherwise assessing.

We have reason to believe that previous tenant also ran into financial disputes with this landlord.

Can anyone explain how these landlord/tenant court disputes go? Do lawyers get involved? Is it a quick process? Can it be done entirely via phone/email and without physically being there? 

Should we just suck it up and move on?

EDIT:
Follow up question: It's clear that the landlord has no plans on performing the work I'm being charged for by the expert (who I now believe is a friend of the landlord).

Please, help my research by completing this survey.",agiszabo,12,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/1dcy7a/how_does_cultural_transition_affect_your_identity/,"Hello Everyone,

To participate in this research, just click on the following link (or copy the link into your browser):

http://vuw.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_5u9Jjc8ymvM5Sw5


My name is Agnes Szabo and I'm a PhD student of the Centre for Applied Cross-Cultural Research, School of Psychology at Victoria University of Wellington.

I would like to invite you to participate in my study that is part of my PhD research.

In this research I’m looking at how cultural transition affects people’s identity. When moving to another country we have to deal with a lot of challenges in our everyday life. Experiencing and learning new cultures, values and societal norms can be very exciting but at the same time both socially and psychologically demanding. As an immigrant myself I’m also experiencing this process. This is why I find it important to better understand how people living abroad cope with difficulties, learn and gain information in a new culture, and most importantly develop their identity during cultural transition.

If you decide to participate in this study, it will take approximately 30 minutes of your time and it will help us to gain a deeper insight into the identity processes of people in multicultural contexts.

In addition to your invaluable contribution to cross-cultural research, you will also have the chance to go into a lucky draw for five 100$ Amazon vouchers.

To complete the following survey you must:

-be living in the host country no longer than 2 years

-be at least 18 years of age

I would greatly appreciate your participation in this study. And please PASS THIS LINK ON to people you know and who might be interested in participating (e.g., partner, family, colleagues, or friends). So even if you don’t qualify yourself for participation, you can still help me out. Anyone can participate who meets the sampling criteria.

Thank you so much for your help!

I'm currently doing an Internship and one of my tasks is to do research on the use of devices like tablets, pc's, smartphones,... Also the use of social media and how both of these subjects are integrated into your (maybe future?) professional lives.

I would appreciate it if you could fill out my survey, it can be found at:

The survey is aimed at everyone but I've also created a Facebook page to support it. It's a mix of humorous content and news and is mostly aimed at students. Feel free to drop by and maybe like it at:

My husband and I will be traveling to Belgium, France &amp; Netherlands from May 24 - June 8.
Here is our tentative itinerary for the trip.  Would love to hear suggestions…  Spend more/less time in X city, Day trips or Off the beaten path experiences not to be missed – let’s hear it!  While we appreciate art, I don’t see us spending a ton of time in museums.  We like to hike, bike, outdoor skate, eat great food, drink beer, visit crazy local sites, meet fun local people, get in a little romance, see some trees…  We’re on a relatively small budget.


We’re planning to couch surf, stay at hostels, airbnb.com, and homestays with roller derby teams.  I play flat track roller derby in the united states and we’re hoping to get in touch with local leagues for possible homestays.  I will also be skating in a bout against the Paris Roller Girls on Saturday June 1st in Paris.  The only non-flexible dates are the Tuesday night in Antwerp and the Saturday bout in Paris.  Everything else is technically up in the air and can be moved around.  


Friday - Arrive in Brussels, spend the day in Brussels

Saturday – Brussels or day trip to Brugge &amp; the coast

Sunday – Brussels market

Monday – Ghent or day trip to Orval Brewery

Tuesday – head to Antwerp, lead a practice in the evening (roller derby)

Wednesday – Antwerp

Thursday- Antwerp

Friday – Antwerp &amp; travel to Paris

Saturday –Paris, Bout(1/6/13)

Sunday-Paris, Versailles

Monday-Paris 

Tuesday-Paris ? or back to Belgium?

Wednesday – open day

Thursday – travel to Amsterdam

Friday – Amsterdam

Saturday – fly out from Amsterdam in the morning




**Things we want to do, but aren’t quite sure where to fit it in**

-Visit the Orval Brewery.  It’s one of my husband’s favorites and our cat is named Orval

-Visit Chaumont-Gistoux, specifically the area known as Corroy-le-Grand.  My Great, great grandmother was born there (I’m about 1/3 Belgian) and I’d like to visit my ancestral homeland.  Best way to get there from Brussels?  Train? (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaumont-Gistoux)

-Shop at a big market - read that Brussels has a nice one on Sundays?  But is there a better one elsewhere we should go to instead?

-Not quite sure where to best fit Ghent in

I've managed to find a Lidl and shopping at some of the farmer's markets and hopping off and on public transport within 1 hour (Do they even check tickets on the tram?).

But I need some details only you can provide - can you help me out?

1. I want to buy a bicycle - am ok with a second hand one because there's no way I'm plunking half a grand on a new one, moreover people tell me it could get stolen. Where can I get a second hand one?  Any websites? Will the 2nd hand shops (kringwinkels) have them?  
I want one with which I can cycle to even Antwerp - which model is best suited for that?

2. Speaking of which, I am planning to buy furniture and basic cutlery and maybe a toaster at a kringwinkel - good idea/bad idea?

3. clothes - I want to buy a winter coat/gloves/warm stuff now itself, but I haven't found reasonable shops... So, redditors, where do you shop? The only 'shopping district' I know of is the one between the Korenmarkt and Kouter...

4. Carrefour - friends told me the equivalent of a walmart is carrefour, but getting to the hyper market has been a maze - does any public transport go via there?

5. Finally, I'd love to make a few friends - I'm from India, studied for a bit in the US. Once I get a cycle I'm planning to join a sports club for badminton or just cycle around Belgium.

I've got a friend coming over for two weeks starting this Monday and I want to show her around town. I'm a Brusseleir myself, but while planning this ""tour"" around town I noticed I've *never* approached Brussels as a tourist. Places that I walk by daily, I literally walk by daily and never pay much extra heed as I take them for granted.

I've been reading up on the regular tourist spots' history because I figured she can't go to Brussels without seeing (and leaning about) the obvious things, but what I really want to add to that mixture is the more forgotten spots. Those little things everyone walks by, the little entrances that everyone misses, ...

**TL;DR What are some forgotten/ignored spots in Brussels? From places and buildings to pubs to statues to people to views to ...**

Don't be afraid to mention something you think others might find ""obvious"". For example, as a kid I've walked through boulevard Anspach or the Nieuwstraat so often, while it took me ages to venture to the street beyond it and stumble upon the Martelaarsplein.  
Or another example, going to the roof of the GB/Parking 58 to have a view over Brussels' center from that end which might seem obvious to people that went to my school or people that actually park their car upthere, but not so much for others.

However... I'm french (from France), he's a french-speaking brusseleer, and neither of us know enough dutch to be practical.

fast translation for english speaking:

After 2 years of debate the government has decided on the colour of our future license plates. After a black / yellow proposal was refused because those colours were not acceptable by the Walloon part of the country as those are the primary colours of the Flemish flag. A red / yellow / black compromise was also rejected. In the end, after much heated debate everyone agreed on keeping the current red / white combination. 

Really? Can't you even make a decision on colour without bickering. Readability should be your primary concern here, nothing else.

1368716851.0,9,self.belgium,1egcw9,De Post: a Customers tale.,aDuckling,10,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/belgium/comments/1egcw9/de_post_a_customers_tale/,"On a lazy Sunday morning i decided to bake my all time favorite dessert: macarons. However, as i was still browsing reddit at the time in my bed, i decided to look up some cool recipes and flavors, when a rather marvelous example of what looked to be the perfect macaron appeared on my screen. 




This creature of beauty and wonder was covered in dried raspberry sprinkles, had a smooth snow white shell, and a lime filling. I instantly fell in love, and decided to try and research if i could purchase freeze dried berries in Belgium. Sadly, my frantic searches on the internet proved futile, so i turned back to Reddit, deeply saddened by the loss of a not yet even conceived Macaron.


Suddenly an idea sprung into my head, and i typed in a subreddit i had avoided to visit beforehand: /r/snackexchange. I feared the temptations that would come from this subreddit, but i could not be stopped: i had to bake a raspberry and lime macaron with freeze dried sprinkles.


After posting a request for an exchange i found myself an exchange partner, and arranged for some freeze dried raspberries, blueberries and some typical American snacks to be sent to my address.




Due to a thesis that claimed all my time, i slowly forgot my macaron dream, until one day a letter arrived on my doorstep.




BELGIAN CUSTOMS it read, in big black letters. I didn't understand a thing of all the lawyer that was written down in the letter, and i panicked. This resulted in some very selective reading, of which i only retained ""TAX"" ""60 euros"".
I didn't know what to do with the letter, so i called the customs service number. Luckily the gentleman on the other side could inform me that any package sent from someone without a BTW number to someone without a BTW number that was meant as a gift was free of tax as long as the value didn't exceed 40 euros. If it was a gift sent from a seller to a non BTW having recipient, the package should cost less than 23 euros to be excluded from tax.
As my exchange package would be around € 20 of value, i would be excluded from tax anyway.


I filled in the customs paper, filled in that the package cost 20€, and sent the papers back. Ofcourse my macaron dreams were once again rekindled by now.



A week later the postman knocked on the door, and wanted to deliver my package. I stretched out my arms, while already drooling about my soon to be made macarons, when the fellow exclaimed ""Oh dear! I forgot to scan in the package, i can't give it to you!"" I tried to grab the package out of his hands, but he dived away underneath my grabbyhands, and ran away again with my package. 



On monday i stayed on alert all day, waiting, hoping, craving to hear the sound of his motorcycle. Around 1PM i grew suspicious, and walked to my letterbox, only to discover he still hadn't digested the attack from Friday. All my post was laying in my letterbox, no package to be seen. A small card read ""Postman SCARYPANTS tried to deliver a package today, but no one was home. You can go and get your package as of tomorrow, at the grocery-store."" 
Deeply saddened by this outrageous lie i sunk down in my front-yard, card firmly grasped in my hands.
I suddenly noticed something. In big letters there was something typed in the Due amount, that should read €0,0: ""TAX: 16,4€""




I threw down my card, ran inside, and called customer service again. Luckily i again had a nice man on the line, that after listening to my tale told me that i indeed shouldn't be paying almost 100% tax on a &lt;23€ package. He told me he would request a recalculation. I didn't have high hopes, after some experiences with other customer services promises, but i decided to wait anyway.



A few days later, i received an E-mail: ""Beste Aduckling,

Deze zending is inderdaad per vergissing ingeklaard. 

U heeft recht op vrijstelling. 

Er is een herziening van de inklaring gemaakt en de zending zal opnieuw aangeboden worden voor levering zonder kosten.

Met vriendelijke groeten,

 
Uw klantenadviseur""

I cried in joy, finally i could bake those beautiful macarons. Only then i realised exams start in two weeks, and the beautiful macarons had to wait. Which made me sad again.



TL;DR: Freeze Dried Raspberry Lime macarons are the worlds best thing, and De Post has a shitty way of counting taxes, but the best customer service.

So I have a few questions:

* According to stib.be, I should take train 3530 to Gare Du Midi, then metro route 6 to Heysel. That takes about an hour each way so I'd have 2 hours left for my visit. Is there a better/faster way to get to the city from the airport?

However, I do realize that immigrating to Belgium probably will be quite challenging. Given my background, are there any companies who might be looking for someone like me in Belgium? Or does anyone know of any other ways I could move to Belgium while still having some way to earn money?

I speak English and am currently attempting to learn French (but it might be a couple years until I'm proficient at it).

Thanks for any help.

PS: Also, if you know of any friends who might be looking to hire someone like me, that wouldn't hurt either :). This all might be a long shot, but I'm willing to take a chance.
