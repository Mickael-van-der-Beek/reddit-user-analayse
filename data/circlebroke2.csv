1345137916.0,136,self.circlebroke2,ybvdf,"The only ""philosophy of r/atheism"" is that its members are intellectually superior to everyone else.",KaliYugaz,211,75,153,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/ybvdf/the_only_philosophy_of_ratheism_is_that_its/,"And one could argue that the whole point of /r/atheism is to reinforce that feeling of intellectual superiority.

Its pretty obvious when you debate them right down to the philosophical groundwork, as I have done quite a few times. Pretty much the entire dialogue amounts to them slowly backpedaling on their epistemic certainty with every challenge until nothing is left but their own subjective biases, and their denial that they have any.

First, you bring up that they can't actually prove that God does or doesn't exist, and they counter by saying ""You can't prove or disprove fairies either!"" to which you say, ""Well if you can't prove or disprove anything, then on what grounds do you believe one thing over another? To which they usually backpedal their certainty and bring up an argument based on evidence-based probability; apparently there is enough lack of evidence to conclude with a high degree of probability that there is no God. 

Ok, fine. But then you bring up the fact that this can't possibly be the case mathematically; if the Bayesian probability of a hypothesis given evidence is (P(hypothesis)*P(evidence given hypothesis))/P(evidence given hypothesis 1+evidence given hypothesis 2+.....), then they have no known rationally acceptable value for P(hypothesis) and the denominator is effectively impossible to determine, which means that no amount of evidence could logically imply anything with any degree of certainty, never mind the truth or untruth of God. Half the population of /r/atheism will be completely lost at this point (the 12 year olds), the other half will backpedal even further, advocating the use of an arbitrary constant for the denominator and making P(hypothesis) higher for hypotheses that make fewer assumptions (occams razor).

Then you ask what justifies the use of occams razor. In response to this they don't even have a good argument, they just say that if you didn't use it, you would have to believe any bullshit at all. Which isn't even relevant; I could use any other arbitrary organizational scheme that reinforces my own biases for deciding which hypotheses to believe first (for instance, I could give a higher prior probability to hypotheses that are more consistent with religious scripture), and then dismiss everything else as ""bullshit"" until falsifying evidence comes along.

Finally, they are forced to abandon all notions of truth, and resort to instrumentalism: ""Science works, so shut up and accept it."" And thats ok, this is a view that makes perfect sense. Science really is the best tool we have for predicting and controlling reality, and making life better for ourselves. But, you ask them, if science is just a tool for making constructs whose purpose is to make true and accurate predictions, and doesn't logically have or even NEED any intrinsic truth value, then why do you care if I want to embellish the bare scientific construct with my religious beliefs, in the same way that a bridge whose purpose is to take cars across the river can be aesthetically embellished with ornamentation?

The real reason they care, i think, is because they cant stand subjectivity, since the admission that their understanding of the universe also has a subjective and non rational component (in this case an unexplained bias towards conceptual simplicity and determinism) would mean that they are not, in fact, more logical, more rational, or superior in any way to those dumb sky-fairy believers.

**EDIT: I don't know what idiot posted this to r/depthhub, but the purpose of /r/circlebroke2 is not to be deep, it is to bitch and complain about stupid people on reddit. People like the ones who believe that atheistic claims correspond to reality to any degree, until this is questioned to the point that they admit that their beliefs and methods (burden of proof, occams razor, etc.) are nothing more than useful constructs and tools for making accurate predictions, and then go right back to acting as if this proves that atheism corresponds to reality as soon as the philosophical pressure is off.**

&gt;Seeing as hes going to do something thats likely very social, I don't see how its awkward.

&gt;You're just some fuckface who thinks #yolo #swag #smokeweed &amp; #getdrunkerryweekend = socially awesome &amp; games, sci-fi, fantasy, whatever = SOCIALLY AWKWARD.

&gt;I know a guy who goes to my little bros class who travelled across the europe for some yu-gi-oh tournament, yet he's one of the most outgoing and ""socially awesome"" guys people know.

&gt;Just as there are socially awkward gamers/nerds, there are also socially awkward people who don't have any such interests/hobbies.



-----------------------------------------



&gt;How do I say this politely...

&gt;Fuck you and people like you.




-------------------------------------------




&gt;A magic tournament is a game played in a social setting with many other people who are friends, acquaintances, or strangers.

&gt;That is the exact opposite of socially awkward.

&gt;OP is a giant pile of fail.




--------------------------------------------




&gt;Yeah he's such an awkward jerk for having friends and sharing a hobby with them.

&gt;Maybe you should try it.

The circlejerkery reaches galactic levels",Ragnar_OK,126,18,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/vqjew/bash_atheism_day_the_circlejerkery_reaches/,"Give me a fucking break. Even ignoring the blatant ridiculousness of the situation - the fact that they need to ""bash"" things to make themselves feel better, and to invalidate that gnawing feeling they feel on the back of their heads, that maybe they're all just a bunch of immature jerks, that they need to ""bash"" themselves in order for them to not be guilty of bigotry (""hey, we made fun of ourselves too, see?"") - this shit is too over the top. These people are stroking their already chafed members raw, but this latest malarkey is unbearable. I took a gander over the /r/atheism frontpage, and now I want to slam my balls with the oven door. I knew they wouldn't **actually** take a critical look at themselves and realize they're doing more to make the fundamentalists look normal, than make themselves look like scientists, but I thought they would, at least, try for some sort of self-awareness. No such chance.

First link I clicked. [At the end of Bash Atheists day](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vpvt9/at_the_end_of_bash_atheism_day/). A meme of Dawkins saying 
&gt;""At the end of back Atheists day, there still isn't a God"". 

Yeah, there still isn't a gOD, you sure showed... somebody. No atheism bashing, but, eh, I'm willing to let it slide.

Second link. [Atheism bashing day huh?](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vpeds/atheism_bashing_day_huh/). Condescending Wonka, saying 
&gt;""So it's Bash Atheist day, huh? I love hearing about all the ways I'm a dick but still right"". 

That's not exactly ""bash atheism"", that's just ""dude, you're a dick"". Also, just because you *claim* you're right, dickhead, doesn't mean you're right. You need to learn some fucking, just, like, basic reasoning skills. Like, any type, tactile, kinesthetic, just something that makes your neurons make connections and form coherent thoughts.

 Didn't do very well with the first two, but who knows, maybe third time's the charm! [Scumbag Atheist](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vpb12/scumbag_atheist/). It's the ""I'm an atheist, debate me"" meme, with the text:

Oh, go fuck yourself, you fucking dunce! Yesterday, you were all ragejerking about how all muslims are suicide bombers and rapists, but the only thing you can say about yourself is a fucking joke?

Christ. No, you stupid goddamn idiot, you're not making ""fun of yourselves"", you're pointing out your hypocrisy. Also, it's in ragecomic form, so you can doubly go fuck yourself, you piece of shit.

Continuing, [My view on Bash Atheist day](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vp0al/my_view_on_bash_athiest_day/). Fry meme with text:

Another meme, but what the fuck, /r/atheism is nothing more than a karma whoring memebin circlejerk, so why should I let that stop me. This one is so fucking stupid, I want to punch my monitor. Do these people really view themselves so perfectly, so without flaw that even the tame fucking circlejerky bullshit that has been posted is so harsh that it couldn't possibly come from an objective source? What the fuck type of mentality and mental process had to go on in the fucking cavernous hole this guy calls a skull to consider *anything* that has been posted on this so-called ""bash atheism day"" in any way offensive to atheists or coming from literally anybody else than other ratheists who want to beat their meat until it liquifies in a reddish paste. Christ, that was fucking infuriating. Furthermore, from what I've seen on reddit, ***nobody is as fucking childish as you fucking are, /r/atheism*** Nobody else fucking cares that you're ""bashing"" them, everybody's got you pegged down as dumb fucking children. To say that you're even considering anybody else to be on your level is insulting to everybody.

 Holy shit. If smugness was an ocean, there would have never been any life on Earth ever, because this douchebag's ego is so huge that it would have retroactively drowned the first single celled organism. If this guy's arrogance was fire, we'd be living on the sun.

Yes, take a moment to congratulate yourself on having the positive ***bravery*** of lightly and lightheartedly make fun of yourself in a completely non-offensive manner. And when it gets in any way offensive, attribute that to ""the other side"", and dismiss any type of honest criticism outright, without a second thought.

Since day one, Circlebroke has been compared to ShitRedditSays.  A recent meta post that became one of our most popular all time CB posts shows just how interested people are in talking about this subreddit. It seems that a lot of misinformation gets thrown around though and many people don't seem to know what SRS's purpose is, what they take seriously, what they don't, how, if in any way, they're connected to Something Awful, why they ban so many people, and so on.

 [For those that are curious, here is an SRS FAQ from their early days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/o0pdv/meta_srs_faq/)

I've PM'ed ArchangelleDworkin, one of SRS's most active and outspoken moderators and asked that she do an AMA for us to clear up some things, and she agreed to do so.

That AMA will be happening at 8pm EST in THIS post. This AMA is to be taken seriously and treated respectfully.  If a successful /u/nukethepope AMA is possible, then this should be as well. There are 16 Circlebroke2 moderators. We will be keeping a very close eye on this post as we expect some off-topic comments if not a full on raid by anti-SRS or MRA, and subsequently SRD.

We will be removing absolutely any comments we think are disrespectful, circlejerky, trollish, or off topic and we won't hesitate to ban people. If you happen to get caught in the crossfire on accident, let us know the next day and we'll look into it and probably unban you. This is all assuming any of that comes to pass, which I'm hoping it wont.

With that being said, at 8pm EST, she is ArchangelleDworkin from the controversial subreddit  /r/shitredditsays. Ask her anything.

* I am a Christian (Lutheran denomination - ELCA)
* I am in a bad mood. If this is a troll, great work, you win. Fuck, I HOPE this whole day has been a prank on me.
* This is going to be a rant about several recent events that put me over the edge
* I am posting this here because posting it in /r/atheism would simply just see it downvoted by a few people of the many that need to see this. I also think this is more suited for CB part deux.

Lemme start with a expansion of my tl;dr title: Seriously /r/atheism-userbase, knock the aggressive, smug, offensive, shitposting off.

The Onion posted a NSFW article (as I'm VERY sure you are well aware). It depicted a sex act with figures from the Christian, Jewish, Hindu, and Buddhist faiths. I heard about it this afternoon, decided to leave it alone to go watch a movie with my girlfriend, and came back later on to actually see what the hell the big hubbub was about.

I wasn't impressed.

I saw the image and then about a paragraph (half of which was a description of the image). I'm pretty certain some artist at The Onion just held onto it for six months and finally managed to convince someone to write a quick joke about it. It is not the pinnacle of satire or comedy. But, it certainly is The Onion's Magnum Opus in offensiveness with minimal effort. It manages to insult five religions in one post, great job. Don't treat it like a masterstroke, it's just The Onion's shitposting to keep fresh content on their site.

However the followers of four of those religions did not suffer as badly on Reddit today as the followers the fifth, Islam.

Today, reading through several posts on /r/Circlebroke, I got to see the absolutely nastiest types of posts and threads today. I saw people addressing Muslims as lesser people and not their peers. I saw people group the actions of extremists with the activities of the majority of the Islam faith. I people claiming no true scotsman while making broad generalizations. I saw their smug right through my fucking computer screen and wanted to slap it right off. I saw clear vote brigadeing. I saw the same bullshit that happens to /r/Christianity. I saw them pretending that their offensive posts were justified and necessary.

The worst part is, people fucking encourage it and enable this disgusting behavior. Every upvote represents another 12 year old (if not in age, then in maturity) that truly, honestly believes that this sort of action is okay. The post is bad enough, but the voting patterns and comments are just awful.

Let's examine a few quotes, shall we?

(from /r/Islam)

&gt; Mods, remove this. Seriously, that image is just as offensive, if not more so, than the Danish cartoons.

&gt; &gt; Sometimes very offensive messages can provoke very necessary discussions.

You know what? I agree with both statements. The post should have been removed from /r/Islam as fast as humanly possible. I also agree that offensive messages provoke necessary discussions... LIKE WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU ACT LIKE AN OFFENSIVE, INTOLERANT, IGNORANT DICK?

(from /r/atheism)

&gt; The middle east used to be the intellectual capital of the world, and we use much of their mathematics and science today, but then Islam changed, and now with one quarter of the world's population (in Africa, the middle east, India, and the pacific), the Muslim world has for some reason only produced two nobel prize winners in the sciences... When technology is what differentiates us from hunter gatherers, and is what makes us money, one must wonder if they are poor because their religion instils an anti-knowledge attitude.

That first portion of the run-on sentence was right, but the rest fell on its fucking face. Remember how the Middle East was the intellectual capital of the world? Remember how we're using their mathematics today? Islam was around during those times too. 

I see the same exact shit with people claiming the Catholic Church was a major setback to science. They seem to forget the contributions that the Catholic Church made to science. My favorite example is Gregor Mendel (inb4 someone claims Mendel was a secret atheist).

Oh, and let's not forget the big O-word. OFFENSIVE. Being offended is 

I have seen a faces-of-atheism-sort of post featuring Stephen Fry (?) talking about how being offended shouldn't give you a special status or some shit like that.

Here, if being offensive isn't a problem, let me try my hand at it for the /r/atheism-users.

&gt; People say they are offended or you are being offensive because that's a polite way of saying you are acting like a jackass. Entertainers are allowed to be jackasses because that's their fucking job. You aren't entertaining, and if you interpreted the words of a comedian as a free pass to say any offensive thought that passes, then there's another word for you. **Socially-backwards.** It explains why you are spending your free time pretending you're contributing to greater society by circlejerking over a shitty effort at satire. It explains why you post nasty messages to people that don't deserve it. It explains why you encourage rude behavior. It explains your superiority complexes. It explains why you pretend you matter. It explains why nobody outside of the Internet will ever respect you and your shithole corner online.

Go ahead and pretend this is a gross generalization and not a representation of TRUE ATHEISTS. The posts and voting patterns I have seen today smack that kind of claim right into the fucking ground.

Go ahead and say I'm getting angry for no good reason. There are people on the end of your screen (which I KNOW can be SO HARD for you to understand sometimes in your basements).

Go ahead and say this post doesn't matter. That way I know it actually got to you.

Go ahead and say I'm just as bad as you. I know you enjoy using your imaginations.

At my University's football game today, I had the misfortune of sitting next to a group of Redditors. I know they were Redditors because I actually overheard them talking about Reddit, among other things (Legend of Zelda, engineering, current events, memes, etc.) They were loud, annoying, and otherwise just obnoxious throughout the entire game. What amazed me the most though, is how some of the things they did reminded me of how they probably act on this website.



&gt; If I went to Virginia Tech, I'd want to shoot the place up too.

This gem came after somebody brought up VT's engineering school, and it's apparently dreary appearance. None of his friends accosted him for saying it, either. Maybe it's because they're his friends, but it's amazing to me that someone would say something like that out loud surrounded by 60,000 strangers. How does he know that I'm not a VT transfer? Maybe I know somebody who was killed there. Unlikely, but it's a relatively close school, and the VT massacre wasn't long enough ago to be making jokes about it in public.

The funniest thing of all, though, was how they would profess their football knowledge to each other with the confidence as if they were Vince Lombardi, while clearly having absolutely *no idea* what they were talking about.



&gt; Why does the coach keep calling running plays? They never work. Whoever's calling our plays today must be a fan of the other team.

Well gee, maybe because if we passed on every down, then the opposing team would always know what we're doing? This was accompanied by the fact that they would say things like, ""wow what a shitty play call"" after *every single* bad play. Seriously, these guys must be masters at NCAA 13, since they know how to call plays better than a professional coach who gets paid in the tens of millions to.



&gt; Dive tackling never works. These guys [players] should know better than to do that.

Not true. Dive tackling is necessary when you need to make a stop and you can't afford to give up the yards that taking an angle would give to the receiver. (the play in question was a slant pass to the tight end, the broken tackle was attempted about 2 yards from the first down line)



&gt; The center hiked the ball.

It's called a snap. My 50 year old step mom who watches football once a year knows that. And she's even annoying to watch the game with.



&gt; Our punter is such an idiot, we need to get rid of him.

This was after he punted it out of bounds about 30 yards downfield. The other team's returner had looked explosive all day, they didn't want to put the ball in his hands. But if you ask these armchair QB's, it's all because he sucks, and it's not possible they were taking something besides his average punt distance into consideration. (note that these guys probably couldn't punt a dodgeball any more than 10 yards)



&gt; Very funny.

The guy in front of me elbowed me in the groin. I asked him to watch his arms, this was his response. I guess he thought that it wasn't a legitimate request.



&gt; Why isn't he calling more jet sweeps?

Why didn't you stay home and post lame jokes on /r/AdviceAnimals?



&gt; Why isn't Shawne Alston playing?

I explained to him that Alston has a bruised thigh.

&gt; What a pussy. I bet he's not even injured at all.

Right. I bet they sat their star tailback over something that they weren't even concerned about. Or maybe he's faking it. Yeah, he's devoted his life to playing this game, he's definitely faking it.



&gt; Bullshit!

This came after anything remotely trivial went against us on the field. A couple of times they were correct (but still annoying). 90% of the time, whatever they thought was ""bullshit"" was actually adherence to the rules. Somehow they were able to notice at least 10 phantom penalties from the upper deck that the refs on the field *somehow* missed. Forget engineering, these guys should work for the NFL.

Another instance of this was when somebody on our team was called for an obvious horsecollar tackle. No, not bullshit, violation of the rules.



&gt;Why are we kneeling the ball?

Because there's a minute left on the clock, we're up by ten, and the other team has no time outs? Because you can't fumble or throw an interception on a kneel? Because risking a mistake that could cost us the game isn't worth trying to run up the score?

These quotes alone cannot sum up how unbearable they were to be watching a football game with. I'm usually an easy guy to get along with, too. What filled the time between the lines that I've highlighted was mostly either more asinine comments about the game or chit chat about things that nobody truly invested in a live sporting event would talk about (Gangam Style, Legend of Zelda, Lord of the Rings quotes, etc.)



&gt; Your mother has questionable morals.

I forget where I read it, but somebody once compared Reddit comments to a bunch of shitty comedy writers trying to one-up each other. This was the personification of that, as they vigorously rattled off jokes that might be funny to a middle schooler about the referee's mother, and other tired cliches. I guess the reason I posted this was that it was the closest I've seen to a real life circlejerk of the metaphorical sense. Encountering the ugliness of the ""typical"" Redditor (although most likely not representative of the majority) in the wild was too much for me not to share. If they're pretending to be coaches and analysts in public when they probably have about as much football knowledge as the average master race Swede, it makes you wonder what they come on to Reddit and pretend to know everything about.",,False,,t5_2tzax,1348352622.0,,,True,t3_10be8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/10be8h/i_sat_next_to_a_group_of_redditors_at_a_football/,

&gt;""FattytheFaggot"" or ""NiggerJew666""

In what can only be described as ""typical redditor fashion"", users completely overreact, and demand (so to speak), that they be let to hear what insightful commentary somebody called ""NiggerFaggot"" would have on whatever issues are discussed on ToR (also known as TrueCirclebroke).

&gt;Personally I am whole heartedly against this. I feel a person shlould be judged by their actions in the subreddit.

Of course you are, shitmaster, we all know that the only good moderation is no moderation at all. Furthermore, wouldn't selecting an outright offensive username count as an action? If that person posts in Theory of Reddit, do they not take that action, fully knowing that their username is offensive? 

&gt;I think this is well intentioned, but I see it as not just solving a non problem but also over reacting to something without knowing the reason for the name they chose.

Of course, banning racial, sexual, ethnic or any other kind of slurs, is completely ""over reacting"" to what can only be described as a ""non problem"". Christ, reddit, the fuck is the matter with you?!

&gt;'You have no right to not be offended.'

Yeah, great, and you have the right to tell people to not be offended. Fucking great. ""Oh, it's not offensive to me, so stop being offended when you're called a ""nigger"" or a ""whore"". Honestly, if you could just stop being offended by bigotry, it wouldn't be a problem anymore!"" I'm sliding into SRS territory, but holy shit, this is the very definition of ""white privilege"".

&gt;I don't understand why this rule was imposed if not to promote marginalized SRS philosophy in this subreddit. Granted, in curated subreddits, depending on the theme, some curation is in order. But accounts that are permitted by reddit have no reason to be banned here; this is a politically neutral space.

Christ, this really rustles my Jimmies. Why do these people care so much about hate speech? If you can't make a point without resorting to slurs, you have no point to make in the first place. Also, why the fuck is it that any time somebody attempts to stem the overwhelming tide of bigotry on reddit, they get branded as being part of ""SRS""? Shit, I've never even posted to SRS, in fact I've been banned from there, but I have no problem with recognizing that **hate speech is offensive**. If I go and admit that in any of the default subs, I'll be immediately branded as an ""SRSter"", and any points I might try to make will be dismissed out of hand.

&gt;Why didn't you make a ToR post asking what people think about how this rule would change the sub before making it?

&gt;Comes off a tad ironic to me.

Goddamn it! Do you even fucking know what ""ironic"" means, shitmeister? It, apparently, is inherently a bad thing to take away offensive people's right to be intentionally offensive. Also, thank fucking Sagan DePaul Tyson that the mods didn't ask the ""people"" what they thought about the rule.

It is therefore my privilege to 'own' this sub-reddit (insofar as that means anything), and I intend to keep it totally free and open, and lacking in any kind of quality. As you can imagine, there has been tremendous pressure to restrict the content that can be posted here, and restrict the people who can post here; to the extent that I don't even read my inbox anymore.

Some cool changes have been made to the sub - none by me. I wish I knew exactly who to give the credit to, but there are also some I may not necessarily agree with (and I won't jump the gun right now, I'll do some research). What I want to put across is that my intent is to keep this sub free and open. If at any point it is no longer that, let it be known and I will act.

We have something really special here - and it's so, so very easy for it to get fucked up. The tiniest of changes could irreparably damage what this sub is meant to be. Again: free and open. Many of us know just how important those virtues are.

r/circlebroke2 has been made to be the black sheep of reddit. Heck, the black sheep of the internet. People are doing a good job with that. But so long as I have my account here, we will sacrifice no freedoms. I am confident that if any are given away, they'll never be given back.

This is a list of novelty accounts I've gathered up over the past few days. The vast majority have been active pretty recently, though I've thrown in a couple that piqued my interest, and at least one that was incredibly well known that doesn't post anymore- /u/Nonsensical_Analogy.

They run the gamut of possibilities, from SRS in novelty form (/u/treatsmenlikewomen, /u/racism_sniffing_dog, /u/MisogynyPoweredLich) to artsy (/u/illustratingreddit, /u/Sure_Ill_Draw_That, /u/Etch_A_Sketcher, /u/Reaction_on_my_nub), to playing a character (/u/Gradualprowrestler, /u/emotional_teenager, /u/YES_THIS_IS_DOG) to providing a 'service' to the reddit community (/u/DiscussionQuestions, /u/correct_spelling, /u/tabledresser). Many of them stick to their novelties, some can/could do it while making regular posts, such as POLITE_ALLCAPS_GUY, /u/relevant_rule34, /u/4_word_replies_only, or /u/mediumpace. 

Of all these that I've listed, statistically, most probably won't last. Being a novelty account is tough work. One needs only look through /u/novelty-explainer or /u/RATES_YOUR_NOVELTY's history to see them talking about novelties that are not active anymore. 

What ties all of them together? They've all taken some element, and integrated it into their posting persona. We might scoff at this, but is it really any different than the guy who *only* posts how republicans are evil, being a hardcore atheist, or imgur bringing the site down in quality? The only difference I can see in some cases, is that the novelty will usually wear its raison d'être on its sleeve.

To that end, I'm giving you a challenge- Make a novelty. What that novelty is, I don't care. I would prefer it be new, but if you have a *gently* used one, feel free to use that instead. **Don't tell anyone what it is.** Post with it a few times a day in various subs (I'd recommend at minimum /r/askreddit, as you'll get the most attention there.), and when the week ends (We'll say Sunday, after I make the 7/22 Atheism megathread in CB prime), we'll have a roundup thread, out our novelties, and post about our experiences, peoples reactions to it, and if we'd possibly use that novelty in the future.

Everyone who participates will get flair! The person I subjectively decide did the best job will get better flair!

##HARD MODE: 

As I consider folks like Trapped_In_Reddit, Probably_Hitting_On_You, I_RAPE_CATS, POTATO_IN_MY_ANUS to be novelties in and of themselves, with their novelty being who can say the hivemind opinion first, you can choose hard mode, make a WACKY ALLCAPS SCREEN NAME, and go hog wild. Participants will get flair, but the winner of the better flair will be objective: Most karma.

Notice none of them are tagged as racist, and all the top comments are defending the OP. Now lets look at the top comments on the anti-white confession bear.

Apparently on reddit the opposite is true, it's only racism if it's anti-white. Bigotry against people of color is just ""politically incorrect truths""
 

[ I hope somebody realizes you are doing that shit and takes you to court for it.
Racism for any race is WRONG.

Really? Because private businesses having the right to discriminate seems like a popular opinion on this site.

Also, a fun anti ""white guilt"" jerk. Because no one understands racial relations better than white, middle class, suburban kids

Seriously, holy shit. Strong unaware here. 

&gt;Reddit does not have a bias. It just has a larger, more international audience. The opinions are balanced around an international centeer.

Yes, reddit has no bias whatsoever. There is an equal spread of liberal and conservative political viewpoints presented here, as well at stances on social issues.

&gt;I am from Holland for example. But even i have opinions about US politics.

Ahh, a European. We should listen to him.


&gt;So, with an international audience fair and balanced puts the democratic viewpoint straight in the center. With a more socialist/green viewpoint to the left, and a more libertarian viewpoint to the right. That whole fundamentalistic christian world view (that has hijacked the right side in the US) is really an isolated incident.

\&gt;implying other countries' political leanings have anything to do with the US's

&gt;For a redneck fundie, Reddit seems off balance. But reddits political center is the political centere of the world, with a slight bias for technology related topics.

Fuck those le fundie science deniers, right?

Intro sociology professors have it tough. Every snot-nosed neckbeard that goes through their classes has the genius and original idea to write a paper about reddit. There's this asshole, but this is not the first I've heard of it - I had a friend in undergrad who wrote something on the consequences of anonymity on 4chan and reddit.

Aside from how well argued or well written this paper is (spoiler: not well on both fronts), it's the very idea of writing about Reddit that is embarrassing. What's so embarrassing is this: the student has basically done a show-and-tell paper with his hobbies outside of class. It legitimizes the time he spends on this site, and makes him feel like this is something more than what it is. He can show the professor that he ""thinks critically"" about his life, and he can then show reddit how cool this place is because you can talk about in an academic way. Look how sophisticated we all are! Reddit ""experiences ideological distinctions"" (Bourdieu, p 57) in a world with ""new social conditions"" (Finkler p 476). 

Also citing Bourdieu doesn't make your argument any less hackneyed. 

I have this cringy feeling everytime reddit is mentioned in the real world. Hearing an explanation of it on the news makes me want to vomit. I nearly had an embarrassment heart attack during violentacrez-gate. This place is embarrassing. The reason I come here is the same reason I watch fox news; **I love hating things** because it makes me feel alive. 

So anyway, take a look at this dude's attempt to sound smart. It's like a ""best of"" post but for credit.

Okay, you get the point. I'm sure this irks other people because I see it spoofed in /r/circlejerk comments but why is it that every Redditor feels the need to introduce themselves or explain their credentials in the same way?! It would not irritate me nearly as much if these statements were formulated as ""I'm a comic book collector/40-year-old man/IT guy, and..."" but instead it is always ""AS A ____..."" and it drives me bonkers. It's not the natural way that people generally say things aloud in normal conversation but if a person solely looked at Reddit they'd think that members of the English speaking world constantly talked like this and included their background even if it was irrelevant. Ordering at a restaurant: ""As the owner of three German Shepherds, I'd like to order a bowl of tomato soup."" 

Bonus points go to any Redditor who inserts a cumbersome, oddly specific description into this format, like the world *needs to know* their country of origin, their sexual preference, and their occupation all at once. Sometimes it turns into something like a pun thread where all these idiots are feeding off of one another and changing a word or two in the same ""as a blank"" sentence over and over again.

I guess it relates back to how simple patterns get Reddit all excited and take in the upvotes. Advice Animals and ""found this gem"" and ""blank level: blank"" all fit into this category.

Apparently if you visit North Korea that gives you the ticket to do an AMA and do armchair politics and talk about how people in the US just need to visit it.

The circlejerk is always the same in these things:

1. It is a ""fascinating place"" with ""friendly people."" Like we are getting a tourist brochure to theme park, we are sold by OP on how it is THE place to visit.

2. OP refuses to believe that they aren't hiding more behind the curtain, and insists that what he or she saw was perfectly fine and mostly non-objectionable.

3. Armchair politics from a few small observations that hint at the US needing to be nicer to North Korea (or hold them less accountable for their actions, because OP didn't see much wrong).

Yes, because there's *no* way they couldn't be just putting on a front.

At one point the OP is questioned about why he/she would go to somewhere that sponsors concentration camps. The defense:

Sometimes, there is some strangely biased and shitty opinions about the linked content, and this problem has only been excacerbated recently by the banning of default submissions. Given the 'catch-all' form the larger subreddits took, bestof is left to source its content from far more niche subreddits, which has the profound effect of increasing vocal opposition from uninterested parties - an opposition that takes on a most circlejerky, self righteous and unconstructive tone. Here is a recent submission that exemplifies this effect:

&gt; [User gatlin exposes reddit's collective racism and hypocrisy](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/yzwex/user_gatlin_exposes_reddits_collective_racism_and/)

At the time of writing, this post is currently the top post on /r/bestof. What follows inside this thread is one of the worst anti-niche subreddit jerks I've seen since the hitler mods of bestof made the rule change. [The current top comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/yzwex/user_gatlin_exposes_reddits_collective_racism_and/c60at7r) [+77]:

&gt; circlebroke = the biggest circlejerk on the internet.

&gt; Seriously I'm surprised anyone is posting there right now. I figured they'd all be watching the RNC for the new mod-mandated talking points.

*Of course* circlebroke is just another circlejerk. It says so in the rules, and the mods know this. There's no need to point it out every second comment. Straight away, [another user](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/yzwex/user_gatlin_exposes_reddits_collective_racism_and/c60b7t0) comes to affirm the top commenters belief in a completely unironic circlejerk of their own:

&gt; ""Hey guys, reddit is a circlejerk, what should we do?""

&gt; ""We'll just form our own circlejerk.""

&gt; Great idea, guys.

Sarcasm - great idea, *guy*. And then, [another](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/yzwex/user_gatlin_exposes_reddits_collective_racism_and/c60d4mg) affirmation response:

&gt; Literally the worst subreddit ever. *Never go there*.

This commenter is not one to shy away from hyperbole. They even used italics to *emphasize how bad it is*.. that's like, so edgy. [Another top level comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/yzwex/user_gatlin_exposes_reddits_collective_racism_and/c60atbj) then continues the idiotic trend of subreddit bashing and supposedly clever use of typesetting markup:

&gt; I'm sick of circlebroke making it to bestof. Why?

&gt; **It's an awful subreddit**. It's full of idiots, pedants and purveyors of whiny bullshit. I've never seen a crowd of petulant sucky little shits complain so loudly about a site they're part and parcel of. It's like complaining about a traffic jam when you're driving a car through the heart of it.

..and the comments continue on and on and on in this fashion. It's astounding, the level of mutual intellectual masturbation these idiots are indulging in. It's almost like they've come out of the woodwork for the specific reason of hating on circlebroke and nothing else.. I can't imagine these circlejerk/hivemind-apologists have ever done anything useful with their time.

As with any contentious thread, there's always a few voices of reason.

Not one to be daunted by such a seemingly angry and stupid tirade of hate, I tracked down a lot of the top detractors - Most of them are moderators or regulars at a [small, niche subreddit](/r/circlebroke) which - if I recall clearly - has been variously compared to an ""SRS-lite"", a downvote brigade (as is obvious from the linked post), and a bunch of butthurt neocons. The subreddit they moderate seems to be a cesspool of deleted [meta] posts, cliched post titles that overuse the word ""wherein"", and is otherwise a massive circlejerk. I don't understand who let those people become mods, or tolerated their blatant bashing of circlebroke.

I would probably say the same thing if I saw that piece of art.
You made the point that reddit says"" I could do that."" when looking at modern art. But the fact is, almost all people judge accomplishments on the scale of ""Could I do that?"". It's the reason people watch pro sports, listen to classical music etc. Because they are watching people do things that they could not do themselves.
What are people supposed to do when faced with a piece of art that they do not appreciate? It would be great if we were artful and simply said ""it does not appeal to me"". But people generally don't act like that. Every Englishman does not act respectfully towards american football and every american does not act respectfully towards soccer.
When you see a painting of ""Boba Fett"", do you simply say ""it does not appeal to me"", or do you assign a sort of intrinsic value to it?
When you hear ""Call me maybe"", do you not assign a value to it, a value lower than that of Beethoven's Fifth?
Reddit is simply doing what everyone does. They are assigning a value to art. If people don't like the value that is assigned, then I'm sorry.
When an art critic makes a cutting critique of painting, he is not simply saying ""This does not appeal to me."" He is giving his opinion of it, he is assigning a value to it. That's what reddit is doing, if being immature about it in the process.



TL;DR 
They are saying reddit is ""culturally devoid"" for not appreciating this piece of art. Seems like ridiculous expectations with a little elitism thrown in.

[How is belief in other minds different from belief in God?](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xnlrp/how_is_belief_in_other_minds_different_from/)

This is a perfectly innocuous and legitimate question that I asked on /r/DebateAnAtheist, because I honestly wanted to see what the answer was at the time. Unfortunately I had no idea how much of a shithole the subreddit really was. 

First off, they haven't gotten rid of the downvote button, like other debate subreddits. Mix that with several thousand of the worst of the worst people from r/atheism, and you end up with a ""debate"" where every dissenting opinion is down voted SIMPLY FOR NOT AGREEING WITH THE CONSENSUS.

[Like this shit](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xnlrp/how_is_belief_in_other_minds_different_from/c5nxx2r)

How does that deserve any down votes at all? Did I personally attack someone? Make a logical fallacy?

[And this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xnlrp/how_is_belief_in_other_minds_different_from/c5ny78w)

Thats an honest question for fucks sake!!! How the fuck do you down vote people for asking fucking questions and pretend to be ""debating""?!?!

[AND THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xnlrp/how_is_belief_in_other_minds_different_from/c5o5zty)

This is just over the line. Its not just douchebaggery, its blatantly unethical behavior that undermines the supposed goal of the subreddit, and the mods are nowhere to be found. I mean, I don't even understand: why would I be downvoted for CHANGING MY MIND and AGREEING WITH THEM?!?! Are they just trolling?? And the whole comment section (indeed, the whole subreddit) is full of this kind of bad behavior, sometimes even worse!

And last, theres this absolute gem:

&gt;[You're being downvoted] Because it's a debate and you're losing. 

AAAARRRRGGGHH. You know what? I'm done ranting. Comment away guys.

2012: http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/14nrf8/the_most_important_characteristic_of_a_good/

Highlights:

&gt; I think this is very true. I do sometimes realize I am reiterating something for which I don't really have sufficient evidence, but at least I stop doing it when I realize it. As long as you're open to being proven wrong on any of your beliefs, I'd say you're on the right track. [+25]

---

&gt; The problem with this idea is that some of us find it difficult to know what of ourselves to be sceptical off, we are simply to close to the problem. I like it when someone points out some idea of mine that I have no evidence for, it is rare however that I discover my own irrationality with out outside assistance. I am still sceptical of new ideas, but that isn't something I have heard of before.
I have a friend who is not really a sceptic, but he is an atheist (they don't go together I found out). Who rarely challenges his beliefs and will usually fight for them with almost religious fervour. I think you are better to be open to sceptical criticism [+14]

---

&gt; this needs to be spread to more places. not enough skeptics know to do this and despite pointing out appeals to authority, they will always lend an ear to randy. [+3]

---

&gt; See, I do this all the time. I am a psych student, and I try to argue against the mainstream model, in order to understand it, and make sure we're not mistaking medicine for magic. Academia doesn't like it. [+6]

---

&gt; Yeah it's far more difficult to apply skepticism to your own ideas than to apply it to other people's ideas. It's an important skill to learn. [+46]

---

&gt; This fact is why I spend about three weeks lecturing on ""Why you can't trust your brain"" in my Science vs. Pseudoscience class[1] . It is really easy to critique others, much more difficult to do the same to yourself. [+14]

It is therefore my privilege to 'moderate' this sub-reddit (whatever that means), and I intend to keep it totally repressive and restrictive, and lacking in any kind of lax moderation. As you can imagine, there has been tremendous pressure to open the content that can be posted here, and allow all the people to post here; to the extent that I don't even read my inbox anymore except to know who to add to the ban list.

Some lame changes have been made to the sub - none by me. I wish I would put the effort into reading the moderation log to know exactly who to give the credit to, but there are also some I loath with a fiery passion (and I’ll jump the gun right now and blame Ragnar_Ok because he looks like a good scapegoat). What I want to put across is that my intent is to keep this sub as strict as a private Catholic school. If at any point it is no longer that, let it be known and I will act.

We have something really special-needs here - and it's so, so very easy for it to get better. The tiniest of changes could irreparably damage what this sub is meant to be. Again: repressive and restrictive. Many of us know just how important those virtues are.

/r/circlebroke2 has been made to be the black hole of reddit. Heck, the black hole of the internet. People are doing a terrible job with that. But so long as I have my account here, we will sacrifice all freedoms. I am confident that if any are given back, you’ll never give them up again.

I've said far too much - I'm tired. I'm trying to convey a very simple point. Goodnight!

A combination of Vulcan logic and Kantian morality, Professor Beard offers these most precious 10 minutes of his day out of his own moral duty, not external pressure.  To show his disdain for consequential morality, he documents the entire process with two friends and a camera.  Corporal Beard, Ph.Astronaut then proves he is GOOD WITHOUT GOD by uploading the album to the internet not for the approval of an imaginary sky wizard, but for the approval of imaginary internet strangers.

Both of these threads are from the past week and both made it to the front page. They feature men talking to women and-gasp-having the social awareness to not stare at their breasts?? It's not even a matter of self-control like the titles suggest, it's a matter of basic human decency.

There are countless more similar threads out there that I don't care to dig up and it's just creepy as fuck that they get so many upvotes. There's probably a sizable contingent of redditors who have so little contact with and respect for women that they'd do just that.

Edit: some choice comments from the more recent thread:
&gt;This shit pisses me off. If you dont want us to stare at your tits, don't wear a fucking window for a dress.

&gt;Seriously, who wears a dress like that, with a body like that, and doesn't expect people to stare?
&gt;&gt;or rape.

&gt;Come on ladies. When the cut of the shirt is lower than the breasts themselves... you might as well carry around a big arrow pointing to them.

&gt;Do girls honestly get upset when they wear things like this and guys look at their boobs? Or are they just pretending to be mad because it makes them still feel somewhat classy?

&gt;There is no way she doesn't want people to look at them. He should let her catch him staring..It probably makes her horny.

&gt;Women who dress like that AND get mad if you take a look at their tits can go fuck themselves, I always called them out because of that bullshit, it happened to me at least a dozen of times....even if they dont get mad but expect to have a serious conversation I tell them ""how the fuck can I have a serious conversation with you right now? If I jerked off 5 minutes ago maybe...just maybe...I would find the conversation topic more interesting but since I didn't jerk off since yesterday it's impossible"" and everyone should call them out...this vicious and stupid circle of ""I put my tits out because I want them to look but I'll get mad if they look or feel disoriented because they are shallow and bla bla bla"" needs to stop...you put it up, we must look, fuck you",,False,,t5_2tzax,1346013742.0,,,True,t3_yv7s1,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/yv7s1/it_takes_superhuman_effort_to_not_stare_at_tits/,

The Lego jerk on Reddit is really quite fascinating, because on the face of it it's harmless. Forgive me if I ramble a little. I'm trying to sort it out in my mind as I'm writing. 

The primary jerk associated with Lego is that nothing is quite as painful as stepping on a Lego brick. We also find a few subjerks: 

1. The Megablok jerk (""Stepping on a Megablok is more painful than stepping on a Lego because it means your parents didn't love you"")

2. The spelling jerk. (""It's Lego in plural, not Legos"")

3. The age jerk. (Someone will say:""Building furniture from IKEA is like Lego for adults."" Reddit will quickly respond ""I'm 22 and I still play with Lego. You're never too old for Lego, bro."")

4. The topical jerk. This is a recent addition and, IIRC, it involves a news story about some old dude being prevented from entering a part of Legoland because he wasn't accompanied by a child. I don't have the link at hand. I remember reading it quite recently. I actually felt a little bad for the guy. Anyway, this jerk plays off the 'age jerk'.  

So why is the ""stepped on a Lego"" joke so widespread on Reddit. It's not that funny as jokes go. I think that the joke functions as a kind of ""nerd gang signal"". Bear with me here.

Lego are practical, and aid 3D thinking. It's also creative in the engineering sense and one needs to approach each prospective Lego project/set in a step-by-step manner. 

So in some ways Lego is the perfect Reddit toy. It is the epitome of a rational outlook on the world. By making the ""stepped on a Lego"" joke or upvoting it Reddit is signalling that they too are logical, rational, and science-y. 

The Lego jerk I would argue is actually the STEM or logic jerks in a different shape.

[This](http://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1howcb/cops_bully_a_man_into_stopping_and_having_his_car/) is the original post on r/videos. Chris Kalbaugh, a college student in Middle Tennessee, went to a DUI checkpoint on July 4 with the intention of testing and recording police reaction to noncompliance, and was pulled over by Deputy A.J. Ross. Basically, the student and officer argued and the car got searched, but the student left without charge or citation. The (edited) video went viral and the officer got an internal investigation, from which he has been cleared by his department.

Here are some further articles on the situation:

* [Viral video raises questions about rights at DUI checkpoints](http://www.wsmv.com/story/22771502/viral-video-raises-questions-about-rights-at-dui-checkpoints)

* [Driver who recorded controversial DUI stop speaks about video](http://www.wsmv.com/story/22823264/driver-who-recorded-controversial-dui-stop-speaks-about-video)

And in response, the TN Highway Patrol has released the full dash cam video:

* [THP releases full video of controversial Rutherford Co. checkpoint](http://www.wsmv.com/story/22820604/thp-releases-full-video-of-controversial-rutherford-co-checkpoint)
* [THP Releases Full Dashcam Video Of Viral DUI Stop](http://www.newschannel5.com/story/22820401/new-video-of-july-4th-dui-checkpoint-released) (watch the video at the top for a specific mention of the Reddit posting, which the person involved says was done by someone else as he uploaded it to Youtube only)

_______________________________________

I am not going to comment on Kalbaugh's rights or Deputy Ross' conduct since I am not a legal expert, other than that it seems to me to have turned out okay for both parties since the student was not charged or arrested and the officer has been cleared in the internal investigation.

Well, almost okay. Except for *the death threats that the sheriff and his family have apparently received.*

Some quotes from the last two articles posted above:

&gt;The video has prompted death threats against members of the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office, including Sheriff Robert Arnold.

and

&gt;Kalbaugh's video has caused such an uproar, the sheriff and his family are now getting death threats.

&gt;""For someone to drag them in and say you want to decapitate my 5-year-old, and my 10-month-old, I have problems with that, and my wife does, too,"" Arnold said.

&gt;Extra patrols have been place on the sheriff's home to protect his family.

&gt;The department's internal investigation is complete, and Ross has been cleared of any wrongdoing.

&gt;The sheriff said if the student still refuses to give an unedited version of his video, he would at least hope he posts it to the Internet, so everyone will get the full story.

Given the Front Page of the Internet's hatred of police and propensity for witch hunts I am inclined to suspect the /r/videos post (and numerous reposts on /r/conspiracy, /r/politics, and others) helped fuel the threats. This time, though, regardless of whether his conduct was right or wrong, the ~~police officer~~ pig didn't do anything beyond making the driver get out of the car for a search. Nobody was harmed, although the police dog apparently did leave scratches on the door. So should this result in any kind of penalty? Perhaps Kalbaugh should receive payment for property damage? **NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

Seriously, has anyone on this site ever heard of the phrase ""be cool""? They were able to do it for the most part with Obama, but not for nerd-king Bill.

Of note is a few CircleBS regulars in that thread, who are pretty much a voice of reason, although if you didn't know who BarbatisCollum was his message would seem to indicate allegiance with SRS.

This post isn't about picking a side between the war or argument or being SRD-Lite, it's about my absolute astonishment at Reddit's inability to ""chill."" Reddit, like all mob mentalities, act like a dog, with no past and no future, they just attack aggressively and instinctually. Maybe this is self-serving, but I wanted Bill to like this place. Someone direct him to /r/circlebroke, perhaps. #yolo

Also, it's interesting to note that 

1. Bill was immediately observant of what sucks about Reddit... it took me months to see what he saw in a few days.

2. The one thing Bill seems to be mistaken about Reddit is how he's comparing it to Twitter, FB, and other social networks. He seems to think Reddit is the next big thing, but still a regular social network, and it's not. It's aberrant. But I think his misconception is making him engage with it far more than the average celeb, aside from Wil Wheaton.

A little more anarchic, more spontaneous.  None of this ""Introducing Dickhead Dan!"" shit.  And I suddenly realised: Reddit memes fall at the first hurdle in that they never change.  Ever.  Not very meme-like.

When you see things get reposted on 4chan, they change slowly over time.  A reaction picture will be redrawn with another face, or images will be cut up and combined with other images for comedic effect.  It's not much, but at least it's *something*.  It's better than ""I'll type whatever petty shit's annoying me today into a text field, pick a picture everyone's seen a thousand times before and call it a joke"".

Furthermore, 4chan never provides context.  If you see the ""I warned you about stairs bro!"" guy pasted into a picture of something else, you don't see someone saying ""Hey, just made this, what do you think? [OC]""  It's just there, and you get to figure out for yourself if it's funny or not.  It's not in a board called ""Funny"".

I pretty much hate 4chan only a little more than I hate Reddit, but it's a genuine remix no-accreditation culture - because the original creator never gets credit, but more importantly, **the remixer doesn't either.**

**Edit:** [lol](http://i.imgur.com/aWJJU.png)

Just read over what I wrote last night and wondered if it was clear enough.  To give a really silly quick example, in GSG on 4chan a person might ask the board to rate their ruler in the game Crusader Kings II.  A response might say ""0/10, would not swear fealty.""  On Reddit, they'd just say ""0/10, would not bang"" and be upvoted, encouraging more people to repeat it the exact same way.

Not all of those are relevant, but suffice it to say that it comes up a lot.

Why does this come up so often? Maybe I'm lucky, but I've never been hit by a woman, and I feel like if a woman was legitimately trying to mug me or something, I probably wouldn't get in trouble for fighting her. 

My guesses:


- Redditors are angry and wish they could lash out, but rarely do.

They like to say ""if it was a man in the same situation, I would hit him."" No, you probably wouldn't have the balls to hit anyone of either gender (neither would I), but maybe the fact that you want to so bad means you're a little too high strung.

- Redditors don't really respect women all that much anyway.

Virtually any post featuring a woman features comments on her body, whether she would be a good sex partner, or a comic telling her she should not be in the shot.

- Redditors want to be different from ""mainstream society.""

*Fuck* your values man! I live my life based on *logic*, not your stupid ""traditions!"" I'm also an *atheist*!

- Redditors secretly long to be persecuted for their deeply ingrained sense of justice.

For redditors, being right is probably the most important thing, while being pleasant is somewhere near the bottom, see /r/atheism. 

I can almost picture them sitting in their basement: ""Someday some entitled bitch is going to try to hit me; boy will she be sorry. Everyone around me will be so shocked, and I'll probably be kicked out of the packed bar/frat party, but as I ride off on my motorcycle, I'll take comfort in the fact that *I was right*.""

Because they do not consent to us eating them, that's why!

http://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/17v31p/zoophiles_protest_against_german_bestiality_ban/

Choice quotes:

&gt;I agree. Everyone here talking about consent... your dog doesn't consent to ANYTHING you do to it. Being a prisoner alone in your house the whole day is not something a dog would consent to either. Or being castrated.

&gt;And if you think of farm animals and slaughter, the whole consent idea makes even less sense.

.

&gt;If it's legal to kill and eat an animal, I don't see how it can be illegal to fuck it.

&gt;Don't get me wrong, today I'm gonna have milk for breakfast and hamburgers for lunch. But I just don't see how can I morally reprimand a man who fucks his dog when I'm responsible for the exploitation of a cow and the death of a pig.

.

&gt;Yea, considering the opposition had to lie to support their argument, I'm going to support Zoophiles.
I mean, the animals are probably cool with it, as long as they aren't hurting the animals let them love each other. Its gross as fuck, and I don't want to think about what thye actually do with the animals. Its just that, I feel it should only be criminal if they are causing the animal harm.

&gt;Any sex act that harms the animal would alreayd be animal cruelty. Its really just stupid to turn people into criminals like this.

And it wouldn't be complete without a comparison to homophobia (wut):

&gt;People who describe themselves as zoosexual/zoophile feel or believe they feel romantic love for non-humans.
Interestingly, I see the same feelings expressed about homosexuals by semi-phobic people (they're just horny and can't get it from a woman, etc.). I don't mean to imply anything bad about you, just pointing out..

Also, I'd like to note that this thread is kind of funny.

I took my theory based in anger and hyperbole to the test by accessing the aforementioned ""sub"" today, and voila:

1. Ranking in at number 1, the [Paul Ryan ""Soup Stunt"" video](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11ke6s/paul_ryans_soup_kitchen_stunt_caught_on_video_5/), 3146 points.

2. Next we go to ""Tough Guy"" [Rudy Giuliani Bashing Mitt Romney](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11kdw9/this_is_a_man_without_a_core_this_is_a_man/), 1662 points. Upvote if you bash Romney just as hard.

3. Next is a departure from ""politics"" as we'd imagine them to be in the form of news reporting or argument as we get a [gag website illustrating one's perception of an ""evasive"" Romney tax plan""](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11kign/romney_tax_plan/), 1078 points (kill me now).

4. [Article shitting on Romney as governor of his state](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11kf1d/romney_ended_governorship_with_34_approval_rating/), 657 points.

5. [Article bashing studies that Paul Ryan has cited](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11kesl/even_the_studies_paul_ryan_cited_prove_romneys/), because we all know that Mr. Obama has not cited studies that come under similar scrutiny.

6. [NYTimes Article drawing a causal relationship between a potential overturn of Roe v. Wade and women dying at Romney's hands](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11kj3g/if_roe_v_wade_goes_some_women_would_die_mr_romney/). Yep. It's serious hysteria over at /r/politics.

7. The soup kitchen that Paul Ryan went to [slams him here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11jcod/ohio_soup_kitchen_slams_ryan_he_did_nothing/) as we continue through the top articles on /r/politics.

8. The Washington Post [on Romney, Ryan, and soup kitchens](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11jhtj/the_head_of_a_charity_says_the_romney_campaign/).

9. [Article about Koch Industries laying employees off](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11kfh4/mike_elk_exposes_political_intimidation_of_koch/), finally a brea....False - it further pummels Koch for supporting Romney.

10. Neutral [CNN poll putting Obama ahead of Romney](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11khm6/obama_now_leads_mitt_romney_in_arizona/).

11. And for the finale, a quote/chant of /r/politics: ""[Every single day in the newspapers it should be, ‘Romney-Ryan tax plan still makes no sense.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/11jyxk/matt_taibbi_every_single_day_in_the_newspapers_it/)""

Honestly, isn't it time to forcefully rename this sub? I propose something along the lines of:

*/r/WeHateRomney
*/r/soupkitchens

This has always been a long running theme in all of Reddit's adviceanimal 'enlightening' history. It seems that every article or piece of news eventually must be put into adviceanimal form to get to the average reader of /r/adviceanimals to even digest it. This takes away any context of a story and is the chisel that is chipping down the notion that Reddit once used to be a link aggregator. Now as the userbase turns to shorter content and pictures, all seriousness an just about any notion of intellect perceived by modern media is slipping away. Its not a smart website anymore and just about the last of serious discussions by professionals or even hobbiests has left. Now you have to prefix any thought out post as, ""as an X,"" rather than have a comment speak for itself. 

It may only be one example, but I think the trend stands up for itself.

I think the end of Reddit will be the Admins decision to buy out imgur and only allow image and self posts to concentrate and maximize page views. Just imagine if it was the other way around.

In line with /r/atheism's stupid fixation on literal meanings, complete inability to comprehend figurative language, and other swathes of etymologically revisionist crap, it was completely unsurprising when CERN released their 5-sigma certainty that three things were going to happen there.

1. Neckbeards en masse were going to post stupid enlightening image macros about how they were somehow right - not that they had any tangible connection to the experiments, but these are the same smug asshats that probably don't play sport and berate people who support local football teams with stupid ""But you're not playing the sport, why are you so happy"" shit, with not the least bit of irony.

2. Similar to point one, but with quasi-religious glorification of science. Yeah, we get it, it's a statistically significant result. That doesn't mean you shed a tear or two, and say ""thank nature/the universe/FSM/sagan/whatever diety you've replaced with"". It's the wierdest fucking thing about New Atheism - the batshit insane religion surrogacy and support group atmosphere that is - imo, the driving factor of their in group exclusivity and hatred towards others.

3.  and the driving factor behind this post - The idiots starting up with the correcting of 'god particle'. ""No, no, no, we're told, it's the Higgs Boson"", except that this correcting of others by using (you guessed it) image macros and facebook screengrabs. *Oh, they told those fucking fundies! How dare they misinterperate some figurative expression to be one of literal truth because no one's had a chance to tell them otherwise! I say we fucking throw them to the wolves.* Within three minutes of searching /r/atheism, I found these:

&gt;The game market for actual ""gamers"" is still dominated by males. Girls aren't going on steam and buying games, they're buying them on their iPhones. That's why a gaming focused subreddit only has 3% of it's userbase being girls. That's why major game developers aren't making games to appeal to women.

And because they don't play the *right* games:

&gt;Look. My dad is not a ""gamer"" because he wastes time playing slot machine ""games"" on facebook. You similarly aren't a ""gamer"" if all you do is play angry birds on your phone. Yet, you'd be counted as a ""gamer"" according to this study.

&gt;The number of females who play League of Legends, Dota 2, CS:GO, Civ 5, SC2, Rogue Legacy, Bioshock, blah blah blah is nowhere near 47%. I guaran-fucking-tee it.

&gt;It doesn't mean that those games I listed are ""all that counts""; they were just an off the top of my head collection of popular and random games. It doesn't mean they can't celebrate playing games, and I'm sure most people would celebrate finding joy anywhere in the realm of gaming. But it does make their statistic about ""gamers"" useless. Nobody who plays these ""actual games"" (used academically, not derisively) wants to know the statistics that include iPhone games and Farmville. We want to know the statistics for the games *we* play. Those games have far fewer females than any of these studies show.

And just because we say so:

&gt;Unless they're including Farmville and other such Zynga or smartphone games, that's not accurate at all.

You see, *gamer* does not mean ""someone who plays video games."" It means ""someone who plays games Reddit likes using devices Reddit likes for an average number of hours each day that Reddit deems acceptable."" The fact that ~~women~~ females are under-represented in the subset of game-players that we implicitly refer to when we discuss gamers has literally nothing to do with games being heavily marketed towards teenage boys and twenty-something men and therefore giving self-fulfillment to a societal and perhaps industry assumption that women aren't supposed to enjoy playing video games, it's because *they aren't supposed to enjoy playing video games.*",,False,,t5_2tzax,False,,,True,t3_1kfmfk,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/1kfmfk/girl_gamers_dont_real/,

**What does reddit hate?**

&gt;And synchronized swimming is still included. I think the Olympics have really gone in recent years from sport to pageantry. That's not to denigrate the skill and training it takes to be a synchronized swimmer, or that kind of thing, but in its essence, synchronized swimming is an exhibition not a competition. 

You have no idea what it takes to be a synchronized swimmer. It is a highly demanding sport.

&gt;I feel like if synchronized swimming is a sport, digging with shovels should be too. It's actually a useful skill, takes strength, speed, and I'd be more entertained watching a close race with some diggers than synchronized swimming

DAE think sync swimming and rhythmic gymnastic are totally stupid?

r/cringe is one thing. Laughing over shitty videos where people are empbarrassing but make it  voluntary available to the public? Heh, could be worse. But hey r/cringepics really takes the cake on how to be a bully.

First we have [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/190ppq/girl_i_went_to_school_with_is_consistently_posts/) of a girl that dresses herself really daring and isn't the ideal skinny girl reddit seems to adore. She is far from fat and actually quite beautiful if she wouldn't squeeze herself in to tight cloths.

For r/cringepics this means she's an ugly landwhale:

&gt; She has multiple armpits.

.

&gt; Clubbing attire? I think you mean chubbing attire.

.

&gt; Imagine the amount of deodorant she needs

[And next we have (again) the fedora hate jerk.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/190in4/class/) The person wears one and smokes a cigar. Some shitty text anyone could've added on the pic underlines the suppossed cringe this image contains.

&gt; I bet he brings class to the my little pony forums

Hah, clearly he must be brony, since it's fedora. And he's male. And not slim. Gotta be a brony. Ahahah so funny. This is the kind of humor r/cringepics enjoys.

&gt; Just like how this guy will never leave the house.

Yeah, sure. This pic clearly tells me he doesn't leave the house like a normal person.

[Also here's more fuck fedoras and the persons wearing them jerking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/190l90/let_me_tell_you/)

Need more? [Why not teenagers hitting puberty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1905t2/fook_my_ex/) So funniez! Of course they cannot spell correctly which makes the ridicule even better.

&gt; The Ex sure dodged a bullet there. A really fat bullet.

hahah, because she's overweight like many people in the first world! It's so funny!! Don't stickz your dick in crazy!!! Yeah, you get 7 upvotes for stating the obvious.

Hey, I could go on forever with this shit. This is all from the current frontpage of r/cringepics. It's just name calling and bullying.

The whole stupid concept of cringepics is downright immoral. Those pictures are mostly not meant for the broader public. If I post something on facebook, I would like for it to stay there and not for someone to take it and post it so that he and his buddies can have some ""fun"". I really don't get it how r/cringepics doesn't seem to have ever heard of personal rights which are law in many countries. And also let's not forget copyright, which seems to be oh so hated. If I make a photo of myself and post it, I still have the copyright. it's just not right to just take them and upload them to r/cringepics just because those people are not some mean kkkompany that would lawyer up.

I mean the rest of the thread is good, but no one can come close to this. 

Ok I can't be lazy, so ""Ah here it goes"".

&gt;[There are many ways in which the aircraft carrier could be a net gain for science. If it was used to launch an attack on the Texas State Board of Education, for example...](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/znedj/whats_more_dangerous_a_nation_full_of_science/c664upv)

Yes, a net gain for science. 

[This guy tries to discuss something and gets booed into the negatives](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/znedj/whats_more_dangerous_a_nation_full_of_science/c664oj5)



&gt;[the most dangerous is a nation full of illiterate illiterates with many aircraft carriers](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/znedj/whats_more_dangerous_a_nation_full_of_science/c664rmo) 

Obviously our 99% literacy rate isn't good enough. Though I think this user's sentence speaks for itself. 

&gt;[This country cannot afford to be pro stupid; we need to invest in education in Science, Engineering, Technology, and Math. The earth is round evolution is a fact and global warming is real we need to be proactively pro science and education, why because we live in the future and so do our children.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/znedj/whats_more_dangerous_a_nation_full_of_science/c664zaz)

I think Charley Kelly may be a Redditor. 

&gt;[If you want to get rid of scientific illiteracy, you need to stamp out religious fundamentalism. That's the biggest barrier to scientific education right now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/znedj/whats_more_dangerous_a_nation_full_of_science/c666yru)

Of course, we all know that the blood of a fundie is the best fertilizer for STEM plants. 

So in serious thought, I understand the disdain against teaching creationism in schools. I've never had to deal with that before. What I don't understand about the whole thing is that one topic seems to dominate the idea that fundamentalists outright want to end ""science"". Apart from the ancient Greeks, I've never heard a peep about the ""evils"" of math. The Amish aren't against technology, and the Military is certainly not against engineering. 

What bothers me is the bland blanket plan that most of outspoken Redditors have for advancing our country. ""Throw money at STEM fields"" as some would say.

 ""Science can make all of our problems go away"", ""[Look at this actual SCIENCE](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/znm9c/cerns_higgs_boson_discovery_passes_peer_review/), ""Science found a cure for cancer"". 

The list goes on, but the generalization of science as a person makes Reddit sound more and more like 15 year olds. I can only imagine one of these users actually getting into a scientific field and saying,

""Hey guys, check out this science I did the other day. I'm getting is peer reviewed by science right now. Hopefully science accepts it and it becomes actual science.""

I saw posted on ToR [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/10s1qj/traffic_stats_for_11_subreddits_including_5/) and noticed f7u12 numbers are in decline over the past year, I found this pretty amusing since i think their posts there are god awful, I actually prefer the terrible 'le le le le' *(ironically in a hipster way of course)* posts and it looks like they've completely removed 'le' from all comics, actually taking themselves seriously. 

[](//#costanza)

Also, don't laugh but tbh I think i'm starting to like the direction of adviceanimals, even though it's a slow movement, but I can still see how awful and unfunny a lot of it still is so if that's your sub of hate I can completely back you on that. I digress...


##THE CHALLENGE:

The point of this challenge is to karmawhore a subreddit you hate by being in complete character of a typical subscriber there. I realize I have no green mod flair or ability to grant prizes, but I will guarantee GodOfAtheism will personally grant some awesome prizes via flair and praise to whomever makes the most progress and also anyone who participates, I haven't cleared it with him at all but I'm sure he'll cooperate in a punctual and timely fashion!

Why do American atheists act EXACTLY LIKE the christians they hate so much? They go to extreme extents, like in the first thread, to ""thank the universe"" instead of God, they don't want to present something they don't believe in at school (sound familiar?), etc. I bet all of you have already noticed this, but to me it's just absurd. So absurd, that atheism has become some sort of religion by itself.

Are you fucking kidding me? Especially this part:

&gt;For those who don't know me well, let me tell you a little secret. I am an Atheist.

Congratulations on your PhD

Also, this is the kind of attitude that is spreading to Sweden thanks to websites like reddit and people like TheAmazingAtheist:

&gt;Frankly, I think religion is a load of crap, and was invented by bronze-age cultures that didn't have the slightest clue was was causing the things that were happening around them. Locusts? Floods? Droughts? Diseases? We must have pissed off somebody pretty powerful. If we suck up to him, maybe he'll make things better.

It's simplifying all religions into ""people didn't know better back then"".

Oh, and this part:

&gt;Religion is a small island of superstition, fear, and control, **and I smile as the tide of logical thought, knowledge and fact rises to force it under the waves.**

Incredible jerking in the comments section claiming he should write a book, patting him on his back, saying he took the words out of their mouths, it's like a whole stadium was filled with people jerking off to one guy standing on the ground preaching to everyone about how **LOGICAL** and **REASONABLE** they all are, and everyone agrees. Because *Facebook wouldn't understand it anyway*.

5 years ago no one would care if you were an atheist in Sweden, they still don't, but now neckbeards have started to take pride in something 99% of people already agree with. As soon as someone mentions God they will seize their moment. Oh, the teacher is having a slide on christianity at school? *Better not partake in it because I'm so much fucking smarter than everyone else and I've seen through all of the lies.* They are the exact same people who talk about nothing else than video games, MLP, reddit memes and wear fedoras to school. Two frail old men handing out bibles in class bought with their own money, trying to spread a positive message? *Better tell them how much I hate them for being literally more disgusting than Hitler by spreading their lies and hurtful messages, act offended and rip the bible apart in front of them*

It's fucking annoying, and I'm begging you America; please stop spreading it.

We all here have seen it. Users constantly railing against mods. The witchhunts, the cries of oppression, the paranoia of shills. We have also seen the results of huge subs that lack proper moderation *cough /r/atheism cough*. Without further ado I give you [r/muhfreedoms](http://www.reddit.com/r/muhfreedoms/).

We thought it would be fun to point out and have a few laughs at users railing against the mods for being oppressed when they can't do something. Even the admins have been railed against. We would like to keep it Reddit related but if a particular case of having ""rights"" comes up with the Fed or a corporation then go for it (christ knows we've seen a ton this week with the PirateBay-North Korea fiasco and the release of SimCity). It should go without saying that brigading is not cool. So submit some content, circlejerk, be sarcastic, facepalm ooc, but above all, have fun. This is a work in progress so if you got some cool ideas? Mail us. Wanna be a mod? Go for it. Think our idea sucks? Let us know. Go nuts.

Also I would like to plug [r/redditstreetteam](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditStreetTeam/). Short story, I found [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/ikjqv.png) when browsing the Reddit toolbar and a bunch of us (under the influence) started drawing Reddit aliens with logos and laughter. So go draw one. (We still have a giant folder we have yet to dump)

[A primer for the Reddit alien brought to you by Reddit CJ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HzDURQQsCI)

Also, New_Wav is practicing his CSS skills and wants to have fun.

Drop by [r/oppressedfedoraowners](http://www.reddit.com/r/oppressedfedoraowners) and submit some fedoras.

Remember, downvotes are blue, like the color of the sky that fundies look up to looking for some phony gods blessing. Keep those upvotes as orange as the Cheetos on our desks.

Most of those signs are terrible, some are okay, but lots are just jokes about masturbation or sex (why won't the MSM cover us guiz???,) memes or just random reddit shit. Oh, and Guy Fawks masks *everywhere.* In other words, it's a themed Reddit meetup. At least there's some awareness about how ineffective this all is in /r/politics. At /r/restorethefourth, however, any suggestion that people are influenced by the way you dress and carry yourself is met with extreme skepticism.

It seems that this is a key problem with any Internet social activism, that those involved seem determined to bring Internet culture and humor into the protest. Your average Joe will, at best, have no idea what the signs mean and ignore them, at worse, see the protesters as weirdos. It's the same deal with the Guy Fawks masks. The problem is that these people seem to be treating the protests as a Reddit meetup, not as a protest. It's a chance to make a funny sign with a witty quote on the front to show off to your other Internet friends, not as a chance to actually, well, protest. This doesn't mean that there's no place for humor, but it needs to be done properly.

There's also a numbers/organization problem - the reason, I suspect, that a lot of religious organisations can be effective when protesting is that they see each other (in person) every day or two at church. Online communication and organization can't really compare with getting out the numbers, as those on Reddit are a (reasonably) small audience, and these protests weren't widely promoted outside Reddit. It's also much easier to convince someone to go when you've already got a social connection. It's easy to click 'attend' on Facebook and not show up, it's more difficult to have to explain it to your friends at church the next day.

As an aside, quite a few of those posters wouldn't be out of place in a Tea Party rally. Hitler mustaches on Obama and '2013 is literally 1984' really aren't helping their cause, as a ~~regular person~~ sheepie would perceive them as nutters (to be fair, I see a few Infowars shirts there, so some of them probably are genuine nutters.)

tl;dr: If the Restore the Fourth protests (or any Internet-based activism,) want to be taken seriously, they need less posters mentioning sex, porn or masturbation.

[Here is the thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/118vaf/nobel_prize_winner_john_gurdon_certainly_showed/)

Here are some of my favorite comments:

&gt;Feynman mentions that, after he helped his daughter with some maths problems, the teacher sent home a note saying his methods, etc., was wrong. He replied, and, at the end of his note, mention his Nobel Prize and Einstein Mathematics Medal. 

Thats the top comment with 300+ upvotes.  No one knows where they heard it, but they are sure they heard it, but no one can find a source.

&gt;I see math in shapes. When I do math in my head, I'm simply manipulating the shapes to reach the conclusion. My High School Algebra teacher thought I had cheated when I had completed an extra credit calculus problem she gave us. I started drawing the equation on the blackboard to show her how I solved it. She saw my pictures, grabbed the erasure and wiped away my work. I got sent to the principal for being 'unteachable'.

.

&gt;I went back to my 9th grade biology teacher with my BS in Biology and PhD in Genetics. She believed it was her influence and ""tough love"" that put me on track. /facepalm

Seriously?

&gt;My 6th grade teacher was responsible for deciding if students would go into the advanced math track or have two more years of basic math. She put me in the basic track because I never paid much attention and skipped steps to get my answers. Luckily my 7th grade teacher was much better and realized that my being asleep in class, skipping steps and still getting all right answers meant I was in the wrong class. He went to the principle and argued that I should be moved and so I was the following year. My 8th grade teacher then told me I would never make it because they had a 50% drop out rate and I was already a year behind the others. I finished 8th grade with the 2nd highest grade in the class and I mailed a copy of my report card to both my 6th and 7th grade teachers.

What is it with these people wanting to show off to their teachers?

&gt;Always believe in yourself, never let such douchebags stop you from achieving your life dreams 

.

&gt;In high school I was quickly kicked out of electronics class... for being good at electronics. Eventually found out that the teacher routinely did this to students, as he had all the theories memorized, but had very little actual working knowledge in the subject. So if you knew much about electronics already, he'd kick you out. I'd been designing &amp; building circuits since I was a little kid, I didn't stand a chance. I dropped out of school a few months later.

Fred: http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1ib1e8/after_going_on_a_george_carlin_standup_bender/

Some choice comments, overflowing with creamy hyperbole and adulation for a man who was, honestly, an entertainer, not a thinker for the ages:

&gt; I would go as far as to say that the two are the same thing. Timelessness is defined by something remaining relevant to people virtually forever, and as such, George Carlin's standup is timeless because we have always and will always have to deal with the same bullshit.


&gt; He was talking about ""the 1%"" and executing asshole bankers in 1996...when the economy was booming. Talk about knowing what was coming! A great man.
&gt; And if you haven't seen it, this Louis C.K. speech about Carlin is required viewing.


&gt; But even George Carlin has said that his material really hit its prime around 1992, when he did Jammin' in New York. He got much more political and critical then and that's when a lot of his best social commentary started being written.
&gt; **The ""Dirty Words"" and ""Stuff"" bits are just documented as his classic material to distract from all the really genius shit he dropped in the 90's-00's.**


&gt; Definitely timeless, human nature is timeless.


&gt; Bill hicks, he was just as important, although short lived. Louis CK is doing such a great job of carrying that flame. I wish there were more like them. As much as it is tired, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert seem to plow through with their social commentary/satire. It just seems crazy at a time when these voices are so accessabl, nobody cares.

Because nobody has heard of these undiscovered geniuses *le sigh*

This spawns the reply:

&gt; Complacency is a hell of a drug

DAE SHEEPLE?! OPIATE OF THE MASSES?!


&gt; Carlin was so on point. Almost all modern political and social ideas can be reduced to something that he said 30 years ago.
&gt; Tax Policy, Income inequality: ""Stuff vs. Shit"" Public Morality: ""7 things you can't say on television.""
&gt; To me, he's proof that the world is not nearly as complicated as the people complicated it would have us believe.

I don't even know what to say about this. I have to believe this is a troll.


&gt; His material is made up of stuff that's been plaguing humanity for centuries. He just sang it to a modern tune. The man was a genius of tearing apart the absurdities of the human condition.


&gt; I'm actually trying to remember where I read this, but apparently, tragedy seems to stand the test of time, while comedy doesn't. That's why so many of Shakespeare's tragedies are still around, but popular comedy performances in that time are not. I think George Carlin does a good job of making comedy out of tragedy... or at least stupidity. I think stupidity is pretty timeless.

Because, famously, Shakespeare never wrote a comedy. Nope. Not one. *No siree.*


And finally, a bonus NSA-AmeriKKKa jerk, just because we were all getting a bit worried that nobody had reminded us. George Carlin = basically *literally* Edward Snowden.

&gt; ""Those who cannot remember the past, are condemned to repeat it."" - George Santayana
&gt; The fact is, we have been living with the same shit for a lot longer than 20 years.

&gt; Why the fuck are people still using PayPal?
This is the thousandth time I've seen PayPal freezing the funds of someone doing something legal but not politically popular, with no way for the account holder to do anything to get their money.
PayPal isn't a bank. It's in their best interest to find a way that you violated their rules so they can keep your money, even if it's only for a month or so. They make bank from the interest of all the money that goes through them.
Don't use paypal. They'll just fuck you.

OP admits to murdering his sisters boyfriend, who according to him was abusive and a methhead. Just reading through the comments, you get a feel for how conflicted reddit is. They want to pat this guy on the back, but he killed someone.

All of the participants (unless there's some particular reason why we *can't* put it in the header) will get flair, but the winner will get special flair that stands out and you can show off to your grandkids and strangers walking down the street if you've got your laptop out.  Up until then, either hold on to your submissions and post them in the followup thread next Sunday or PM them to us for thoughts and suggestions, or if you just won't be around next Sunday and want us to post it for you.

For those of you that already have image flair or would rather have your font name changed, I have that in the works too.

## What is this and what is the difference between this and /r/circlebroke?

/r/circlebroke2 is a freer version of /r/circlebroke. Basically, anything goes (as long as it's on-topic within the ""breaking the circle"" thing we do). The reason this place exists is to maintain quality in /r/circlebroke.

## So what is allowed?

As I said, anything goes. The mods won't remove your post unless we think it sucks or your name is DesertTortoiseSex.

## So why should I post here rather than /r/circlebroke?

Because the mods of /r/circlebroke try to maintain quality over quantity. If it's just a link you're submitting without much thought behind it, it's better off here, otherwise it *will* be removed.

## Anything else I should do?

Read the rules. If you aren't sure if something should be posted, message the moderators and then we'll tell you no.

## Can I be a mod?

Yes.

## Really?

No.

## I seen the moderators doing something crazy! What do I do?

/r/circlebroke2 is sometimes a place to test crazy shit that the /r/circlebroke mods may want to implement, or maybe they're just bored. Walkabout, for instance.

## What's with the CSS?

It was designed by M. C. Escher. Just kidding; GodOfAtheism dropped acid one day and came up with this.

## Can I submit an image bar (cool image at the top that rotates every refresh)?

Sure, go for it. The one in /r/circlebroke was made by a user.

## How are moderators chosen?

First, an application, resume and cover letter are submitted, then two references are submitted and questioned about your self, then a multi-level background check is done. Afterwards, you are brought into our office and questioned  by FBI and CIA interrogators. Then you are made to attend Delta Force training. Upon completion, your real training begins.

## Some other question about moderators?

Shut up, you'll probably never be a moderator.

## But--

SHUT UP

## I have a question about what type of underwear I should wear

[Shoot us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcirclejerk)

## How do I use the image macros?

1341006476.0,29,self.circlebroke2,vtdik,Petition to upgrade /r/circlejerk to default subreddit status,miggyb,34,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/vtdik/petition_to_upgrade_rcirclejerk_to_default/,"**Not an actual petition**

Continuing from [yesterday's thread on what can be done to improve reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/vqy9y/dear_circlebrokers_what_changes_would_you_make_to/), I just got this idea and was wondering what you guys would think of that.

Here's my reasoning:

1. Most of the blatantly offensive posts or tricks to get people to upvote have found their free range home on /r/braveryjerk. It's subtle, but that's really cleaned up circlejerk and it's way more family friendly now. Why, there's [only one reference to rape](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/vsmnr/i_was_anally_raped_by_bill_murray_and_when_he/) on the top 25 and it's anal so doesn't even really count. (Also, it's making a reference to an /r/pics post, not just saying 'upvote to anally rape everyone!)

2. Since removing /r/atheism from the default subreddit list would [inevitably brew up a shitstorm](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/9efxf/an_explanation_of_why_the_atheism_reddit_does_not/) I think the admins are hesitant to demote them again. This is unfortunate since from what I can tell, demoting ratheism was almost unanimous. I didn't see any discussion sticking up for it on yesterdays post (although I think this subreddit probably isn't the best place to feel comfortable standing up for them. Someone can PM me if they want me to take the downvotes for them).  Again, from what I can tell, it seems we all agree here that what they did on bash Islam day wasn't very respectful and showed reddit in the wrong light to any people just passing by.

3. The circlejerk mods have proven themselves capable of organizing an enjoyable circlejerk while keeping things safe and OSHA-compliant. GodOfAtheism has personally corrected me in proper stepladder usage while attempting the elusive figure 8 circlejerk during the circlejerk meetup last year. We all remember how horribly that failed, but thanks to careful supervision from the mods there, nobody was hurt and there were only minor bruises and scrapes. For that, I am eternally grateful. My point is that I am absolutely confident that the mods would be able to handle any incoming shitstorm of new content, by any means necessary. If keeping /r/circlejerk fun and family friendly meant removing posts and comments en mase /r/askscience style, I have no doubt they're badass enough to do it.

4. It would give an outlet to anyone who likes reddit but has an unpopular opinion or two (thinks abortion should be the choice of both parents instead of just the mother, thinks that weed should be legalized but only to gays, etc). Circlejerk is a great catch-all for unpopular opinions, given that you can come up with a satirical way of putting it.

5. If all goes to hell, we can all move up a level of meta through the already established /r/[meta[meta[meta...]]]circlejerk system.

Way to just fish for karma, you goddamn dimbus. 

It's like /r/pics isn't even there to look at good pictures. It seems like the ONLY frontpage material is stupid sob story shit. I don't get it. It's like the stuff from pics that gets to the frontpage is the stuff that I'd see on an AdCouncil commercial. ""My black urban son is smart"", ""My retarded sister is going to prom"", ""LOOK I BEAT CANCER!"". It's not that I'm not happy for them or whatever, but it's the blatant karma whoring that pisses me off. 

Note: This comment and it's response. I think it wraps up the situation quite well. 
         http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17s2nw/my_sister_who_has_special_needs_is_having_her/c88dfwq

They don't give a fuck about the quality of the picture at all. I would suggest heavier moderation, but it's impossible for that to happen in a default because people would whine ""literally stalin hitler mods want freedom to be stifled even though we bury things we don't agree with"". 

To critique the picture itself: 



1. The cutoff on the foot seems incredibly awkward. They should have chosen a waist-up or a better framing of the whole body. 

2. It seems slightly off-center. It's tilted.

-

Looks like shitty_watercolour is in the lead at 20 votes, followed by ""this isn't a question but I love your work"" at 7.

Personally, I call some sort of pun.  It's too difficult to guess exactly what the pun would be, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess something about ""being a fan"" and ""fan death"".  Something along the lines of ""I'm your biggest fan!  Don't leave me on through the night!""

NOTES:

- If you made multiple guesses, I only added your first one. 

- Leave a comment if you want your prediction/vote added to the chart.

- I'm not actually ""in charge"" of this, I just wrote up the chart.  Here's the [original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/11va1g/mod_postcontest_psy_is_having_an_ama_on_the_24th/).

The only reason I've ever considered circlejerks as bad is because of the situations where they hinder actual discourse. Okay, so my point is:-

What if sometimes the jerking and pitchforking against authorities type of behaviour is relevant and useful? Hell, the only time governments listen to people outside of the month leading up to elections is when people yell loud enough, and the internet is a useful vehicle for disseminating opinions. Maybe this reactionary bullshit is sometimes necessary.. This post has made me consider this like no other before:

To get the list rolling I'll add the first few bands:

* Queen and anything related to them.
* Radiohead
* That band with the lady with the potato face on the cover.
* Gorillaz
* Limp Bizkit
* Every band mentioned in Questionable Content.
* Metric
* Prodigy
* Nirvana
* The Beatles
* That band that made Debaser
* Immortal Technique's Dance with the Devil
* Arcade Fire
* BOB CLUCKING DYLAN
* Anything used in a Quentin Tarantino movie
* ~~Jack White, not all his stuff, but~~ you know I don't need to see Seven Nation Army as a top post again as long as I live.
* `^`You know what, just blacklist The White Stripes
* Any and all dad rock
* Queens of the Stone Age
* Foo Fighters, or just about anything involving Josh Homme or Dave Grohl, really, unless it is really new and original.
* Tool
* Nine Inch Nails
* Johnny Cash's cover of Hurt.
* Pink Floyd - *After* 1972.
* Sonic Youth

Sriracha is one of those weird things that Reddit leeches on to and (for reasons I'll never quite understand) absolutely refuses to let go. Kind of like Nutella or stepping on a Lego (???). I mean, it's a hot sauce. How much is there to really say about that? It's hot? It's good? It's good and hot? Well 316 people (at the time of me typing out this post) felt the need to chime in about the mind-bending glory that is Sriracha. Here are some of my favorite highlights:

That's reasonable. But the top comment below that with twice as many upvotes:

Ok cool.

But Reddit keeps praising the oatmeal guy like he's some sort of hero. Does he actually contribute or is it just everyone else's money? I understand that a charity actually handles the money so I don't think or assume Oatmeal is some sort of swindler. But Does he contribute at all? I try to google and look through his site to see what he contributes and it doesn't say. So why do people say ""the oatmeal reaches"" when really its ""we^1 reached""? If he's not doing jack shit stop saying ""he did it.""

Oh and if you contribute a lot, like 3k, he'll draw you. Yeah, no thanks, I don't want to look like I belong on the back of the comic section for New York Times. 

300$ for your comic book on nikol tesla? I'm not sure what is more stupid, the price of TI-86 calculators or this comic book. 

33k$ gives you a feature on the oatmeal. Not bad, especially considering the views one could get. But this is another prize that doesn't require the oatmeal to get up and do something. 33k and boom he writes something on his laptop. So does it really justify the 33k price mark? I understand its priced because of the high traffic he generates BUT what business that isn't large could easily afford this? If I had 33k right now the last thing I would be thinking of is an endorsement from the oatmeal, and even if he did blog/link you, who would be truly interested in you? How long would the ad stay? Sure he gets a lot of views but it's still an investment risk.

You'd think that maybe if you invested that much you could have a place in a museum like a plaque with your name. 

&gt;DO THIS AND KITTENS = SAVED

I know this is a jab at the weird sort of ""internet humor"" but it's really fucking dumb and sick of this sort of pandering, it reminds me of that guy that was running a kickstarter for ""meme defense"" (basically a tower defense themed by internet memes.) and pretty much anyone else trying to game reddit.

So, I still understand why the Oatmeal guy praised as such a hero. He just makes funny comics (*sometimes*, he really needs to avoid toilet humor and fart jokes.) and that's it. If he's not contributing, stop showering him like he is finding the cure to friendzoneness. I don't know what sort of money he is contributing, but if he contributed a significant factor (like more then the stupid 33k) than ok he deserves to be called a hero or whatever. But if he isn't than he isn't doing anything himself for the museum other than spreading the word. 

I understand he's funny for reddit plebeians and all and what they're doing is a good thing but let's calm the fuck down on the hype, ok? And stop posting it on every subreddit, fucking annoying.

Redditor /u/biodrones posts an imgur link glorifying the painting on the roof of the sistine chapel. I don't fucking understand how this is meant to be some crowning acheivment for atheism.

Oh, and this: (quote from the thread)

&gt;Meshberger also argues that there appears to be communication present despite the gap between the depicted Adam and God, just as neurons transmit biochemical information across synaptic clefts. Further, below the right arm of God, the painting shows a sad angel in an area of the brain that is sometimes activated on PET scans when someone experiences a sad thought^**1**

..doesn't make a lick of sense. I very much doubt that Michelangelo had access to PET scans or microscopes with the optical resolution to see individual synapses. But hey, they're okay with it because it's ***SCIENCE*** This whole thread is Ratheism seeing exactly what it wants to see in the world. Fucking selection bias writ large.

Michelangelo wasn't even a closet atheist - he was a closet non-*catholic.*

/r/atheism is a lot of things. They have a lot of flaws. So do all subreddits, right? But the attitude and character that the subreddit represents infuriates me. The reason it infuriates me is because these posts represent the attitude of real people. People who actually think like that, not just for ""teh lulz"" or to get some shock value. Not to troll others or for the sake of debate. They actually feel that way about people in real life.

It breaks my heart to know that people can be filled with so much hate, narcissism and pretentiousness that they will up and leave when they find out a woman/man is a Christian. Everything is going fine up until that point but once that topic comes up ""LOL CYA BITCH!"".

The amount of hatred and prejudice that takes is astounding and I don't understand how someone like that can call themselves a paragon of equality and humanity.  The hypocrisy on this specific micro-jerk that takes place on /r/atheism is one of the most hypocritical. 

&gt;DAE hate Christians because literally all of them hate gays?  Also, I was on a date with this really cute girl, turned out she was a Christian so I berated and dumped her solely on that.

This is more of a rant but it infuriates that these people can have so much prejudice and hate but then claim to fight that same prejudice.

An extinct jerk?",EnlightenedYouth,26,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/1jz0zw/greetings_we_are_from_the_internet_an_extinct_jerk/,"This is something that just happened to cross my mind, and I admit I don't have any actual examples with me to support it, but I know I've come across it before. It seems like Redditors have often preferred to say ""greetings"" instead of simply ""hello"" or ""hi."" Now, it's not really a big deal when said in the context of a lighthearted post and certainly pales in comparison to ""LE BACON NARWHAL"" or whatever (thankfully I haven't seen that around for a long while).

But I have read more serious posts using it as an opening line, even including the ""we are from the Internet"" phrase, which apparently is usually associated with a self-deprecating maymay. It just sounds kind of *alien*. Maybe that's the point; much like insisting on usage of the term *female*, Redditors can instill the impression, in themselves as much as others, that they are strangers in a strange land, visitors from cyberspace who have come to observe the illogical ways of earthlings.

Though it was some time ago and I can no longer find it, I read a post in which the exact line in my title was used and it came across in a frankly embarrassing manner. It was during one of Reddit's infamous witch hunts, and the victim somehow found her way to the post that kicked it off. A Redditor responded with ""Greetings. We are from the Internet."" and proceeded to give a probably unsatisfactory explanation for why she was being harassed by anonymous strangers. The whole thing was simply distasteful, but that opening line summarized the discomfort, from the cold, impersonal, *logical* ""greetings"" to the implication that ""we"" are some sort of international elite justice force from the mysterious cabal known as ""the Internet.""

Anyway, I realized that although they once appeared to be more widespread I haven't seen the use of ""greetings"" or ""we are from the Internet"" in a while. Have they finally fallen into disuse?

I hope so. Maybe after spending so much time immersed in Earth society Redditors are becoming accustomed to our primitive conversational rituals.",,False,,t5_2tzax,False,,,True,t3_1jz0zw,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/1jz0zw/greetings_we_are_from_the_internet_an_extinct_jerk/,

",,37,8,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/103jp4/does_calling_women_females_make_you_smarter/,"Why does reddit constantly refer to women as ""females""? I'm not talking about instances in which any normal person would use the word, like saying ""female friend"" to distinguish from ""girlfriend"" or in medical/scientific contexts that require a term for the gender. Reddit uses it all the time to talk about women. There are **literally** too many examples of this to cite, but here's a couple:

[This young male](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/102j4h/stepped_outside_at_137_am_and_thinking_i_was_safe/c69w7u4) went to a bar and talked to a wild female human he met there. (Bonus bizarre story about a gay wingman).

[This woman](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/100vv7/i_dont_give_a_shit_about_my_front_lawn_what_are/c69in3a) self-identifies as a ""female"" about half-way through her post, inspiring, among other things, a [declaration of love](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/100vv7/i_dont_give_a_shit_about_my_front_lawn_what_are/c69ol0r).

Finally, if you want the whole picture rather than just excerpts, [here](http://www.reddit.com/search?q=female) is the search for the use of ""female"" on reddit. In the majority of cases, it's used when ""woman"" would be more appropriate. 

WTF is this? I have two theories about it. 

* reddit thinks they are being more accurate when they say ""female"" because having to distinguish between ""girls,"" ""young women,"" ""women,"" ""ladies,"" ""dames,"" ""sluts,"" ""cumdumpsters"" etc. is too difficult. And why address yourself to only one subgroup of female humans when you can do some much more when you designate them scientifically by their defining sexual features.

* reddit is embracing the word because it sounds nerdier than saying ""woman"" or ""girls."" Since they've heard it used by their doctor before, or they can imagine it being in a super-important scientific study, they think it exists in a higher register language that only they - the most enlightened of people - have access to. 

Here's the most pessimistic version:

* reddit is so unbelievably misogynist that it has to use words like female to talk about women; misogynist, because ""female"" is a term usually reserved for animals. You would never see a redditor say ""As a male,"" or ""I was hanging out with a male at the bar when..."" but you could easily imagine someone talking about ""male dogs"" or ""male cats.""

Poland? **Because it was the only thing standing between him and Russia. Czechoslovakia?** That too, to a smaller extent. **When France and Britain declared war,** however, it complicated his plans and he decided to invade all the Western countries to end the war as quickly as possible instead of dragging on and delaying his plans for Russia. **Only when Britain refused peace, was he forced to continue occupying France,** Belgium and all the other Western countries to maintain a defensive position. **Hitler wanting world domination is false and to believe otherwise is to ignore logic.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1ip40m/til_the_nazis_planned_to_have_the_native/cb6rpjk)

 [The sad thing is, the truth is far more interesting than what's being discussed here. Both Britain and Germany launched massive propaganda operations on the USA before it's entry in the war to ensure it's support. British intelligence officers (of which Roald Dahl was one) infiltrated American media outlets and ensured that pro-British articles were released to make the American public sympathise with the British cause. This effort was to be one of the largest British intelligence operations of WW2. It would be interesting to ask what would have happened if this effort was not made (don't forget the USA had very isolationist policies pre-WW2).](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1ip40m/til_the_nazis_planned_to_have_the_native/cb6skxb)

His best comment is

with a score of -70. The top reply to that

 at +101 is kind of funny though.

Yeah, nothing too original here:

&gt;Not tipping. I would like not tipping to be socially acceptable.
I'd like to see workers paid a fair wage and tipping to be reserved for exceptional or above average service.

I know the anti-tipping jerk has been done to death around here, but seriously, either way you pay the same amount of money.

&gt;Being introverted. I don't mean hating social interaction, but a lot of the time I just want to stay at home and relax my own. People always think that its weird or unhealthy.

DAE feel oppressed?

&gt;I would make willful ignorance socially unacceptable.

Brave, although there's a lightly downvoted comment calling him out.

&gt;Carrying a sword in public.
It needs to be acceptable again.
That and dueling.

Murdering people for petty social rivalries sounds like a *great idea.* Also, do  you wear a fedora with your classy sword?

&gt;Capes and cloaks become fashionable. Would be awesome.

The above, pretty much.

&gt;Should be socially unacceptable to look at your phone while talking to other people.

This is already socially unacceptable.

&gt;I want to live in a world where it's socially acceptable to like your favorite porn vids on facebook.

I really don't have anything to say to this one.

I honestly don't know what to think of this post. The fact that /r/atheism resorts to arguments like these instead of, well, *real* arguments is unfortunately expected. Also, the OP most likely ripping the argument from somewhere else and putting it into a image is just typical of reddit.

Elsewhere in the jerk, you can find ""examples"" of abusiveness of relationships. Some include the Church being abusive (no duh) and the US government (didn't expect that!). There is a little sexism with the typical redditor saying ""why are women typically more religious (read: overly attached) and not free and independent like us?.""

The OP made a ridiculous set of arguments for this post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vyz85/the_parallel_that_turned_me_away_from_christianity/c58u09q) and it got voted to first.

Norwegian officer here, American officers are trigger happy and out of control. I serve with the K9 unit, and there is -nothing- in that dogs body language that poses a threat. This happens because there is no consequence to the officers involved, I hope Reddit can turn things around this time.

This is exactly the kind of situation that damages the reputation and respect for law enforcers world wide. As a matter of fact, the officer involved would have been screened for psychopathy. But I guess thats what passes for officers overseas, shrug.

Summary: OP dated a girl, girl's father hates him, some bullshit happens, father hits girl, father pressures her into breaking up with OP, which she does.

Redditors came out of the woodwork to chastise not just the father, but the girlfriend for being a crazy bitch and breaking up with OP:

&gt; The father hit her and then she broke up with you?
Stay the fuck away from that family. They're crazy.

-
&gt; I so agree! And count yourself lucky finding this out now rather then later.

-
&gt; She was the one who abandoned him.

-
&gt; really? having a father who hit me promise threaten to not speak to me again if i stayed with a person I had been in a (hopefully healthy) relationship with for 3 years, I would jump all over that option.

-
&gt; Hell, it's not OP's problem. Dodged a bullet, he did.

-
&gt; (Response to '""Crazy"" is very, very different from ""abused"".') I find abuse creates crazies.

It's almost as if she can't make the rational decision to cut off her abusive father because of a really shitty childhood.

Every single fucking day. What do we see on /r/SubredditDrama?

""Slapfight between MRA's and SRSisters""

""Argument between users in /r/lgbt heats up when &lt;insert mod&gt; shows up""

""Dworkin/RobotAnna says she literally wants to fucking murder every person in the world that isn't opressed for the gender/orientation.""

Obviously these aren't exact quotes, but you get the idea. It just seems impossible for their to be any discussion on the internet about the real issues of society concerning mistreatment of people that identify as any oppressed gender or orientation. It usually seems to go something like this (not always in this order):

""Angry"" Feminist: I think in order to compensate for all of the mistreatment women have had for the past few thousand years, men should have to suffer in some way.

""Calm"" Feminist: I disagree. I think we should all try to peacefully coexist and try to move past the times in which women were oppressed.

""Angry"" Feminist: Oh, so we should just forget all the horrible things men did to us? You're banned.

""Calm"" person: WTF? You're just banning them for disagreeing?

""Angry"" Feminist: Yeah, you're banned too.

""Angry"" MRA: WHAT THE FUCK. SERIOUSLY. IT'S ALWAYS THE FUCKING SAME WITH YOU FUCKING WOMEN. YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU WANT EQUALITY BUT IN REALITY YOU JUST WANT TO CUT OFF THE TIPS OF OUR DICKS AND STEAL OUR SPERM.

""Angry"" Feminist: You see, fellow feminists? Everyone that disagrees with us is exactly like this MRA here.

Other ""Calm"" Feminist: Yeah, I agree with that. That guy was a dick.

Now, in that example, it seems I am radically against this ""Angry"" Feminist here, but let's look at another sample, this time from the other side.

""Calm"" MRA: You know, I really hate how women always get custody in divorces. I don't want to risk losing my children if it turns out my wife and I have irreparable differences that would cause us to get a divorce.

""Angry"" MRA: Yeah, I also hate how everytime someone mentions rape, it's always about men raping women. Women rape men too!

""Calm"" person: That might be true, but it's not nearly as big an issue as the whole men raping women thing.

""Angry"" MRA: WELL MAYBE IF THEY DIDN'T WEAR SUCH SKANKY CLOTHES THEY WOULDN'T GET RAPED SO MUCH. MEN DON'T WEAR SKANKY CLOTHES AND IF WOMEN WANTED TRUE EQUALITY THEY'D ALSO NOT WEAR SKANKY CLOTHES. Fucking sluts...

""Calm"" Feminist: WTF? Woman should be able to wear whatever they want?

""Angry"" MRA: SHUT UP BITCH. IF YOU WERE REALLY FOR EQUALITY YOU'D BE CALLED AN HUMANIST OR SOMETHING AND NOT A FEMINIST.

""Angry"" Feminist: You see, everyone? This is what everyone that isn't a feminist believes.

""Calm"" Feminist: Yeah, what a dick.

So yeah, this is why we can't have a decent discussion about these issues on Reddit. Angry people fuck it up for the rest of us and then the calm ones agree with the angry ones because fuck it that's the loudest voice in the room, so it must be right.

I mean fucking honestly. It's twenty fucking twelve. Humanity has existed for over 10 thousand years and we still can't get the fuck over minor fucking differences between fucking people. There are at least 3 million fucking users on this website. If we tried hard enough, we could organize and be a potent geopolitical force that spans borders and enacts great change for human welfare. The consequences of a Reddit-led drive to end world hunger or find peace in the Middle East or fucking something would have lasting effect on the way we as people understand altruism and each other. We can literally save the world and go to space BY OURSELVES without having to sign an internet petition and without upvoting any AMA's by Congressman Hivemind. But no, we argue amongst ourselves about who's been oppressed the most and why we should give a shit.

&gt;JERUSALEM (AP) -- **Mitt Romney is telling Jewish donors their culture is part of what's made Israelis more economically successful than the Palestinians.**
&gt;
&gt;Romney on Monday said Israel's GDP per capita, a way to measure wealth, is more than twice that of the Palestinians.
&gt;
&gt;**He says the ""power of at least culture,"" in addition to an innovative business climate and the ""hand of providence,"" are the reasons why Israel is so much wealthier.**
&gt;
&gt;According to the World Bank, Israel's GDP per capita in 2005 was more than eight times higher than GDP per capita in the West Bank and Gaza.
&gt;
&gt;Romney spoke at a fundraiser with top donors at the King David Hotel. After the money-raising event, he's traveling to Poland, the last stop on his weeklong foreign trip.

July 29th is NASA's ~~birthday~~ cakeday and the space cadets of /r/todayilearned are celebrating by [waxing nostalgic for the bygone days of the Eisenhower Administration.](http://np.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1j9ant/til_on_this_day_55_years_ago_nasa_was_created_by/)

&gt;[Eisenhower] would be saying ""I told you so"" quite a bit if he were still around. Military industrial complex was his big warning.

Fair enough.

&gt;Interstates, NASA, Little Rock Nine, WW2 Commander. Yet Eisenhower was hardly talked about in history books.

Eisenhower has literally been forgotten by history. Yet I would wager the average person could say much more about him then any randomly-selected Gilded Age president. Edit: also the interstate system included a military angle as a major purpose for its construction.

&gt;While he was before my time, from the historical knowledge ive read, I view President Eisenhower as the last president that was truly and universally good for this country. He was a domestic president, who not only promoted building up our own country, rather than tearing down others, but actually followed through on that with programs that changed our country for time immemorial.

I guess the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was not universally good for America? Though such a sentiment wouldn't exactly be out of place among certain denizens of this site.

&gt;Imagine what Eisenhower would say if he lived to see us catching rides with the Russians to the ISS, because of all the cash we spend on that Military Industrial Complex he warned us about didn't leave anything for NASA.

Perhaps he'd be glad that we are much more able to cooperate with them today than during his era.

&gt;Here's to next 45 years of having asshole U.S gov all up in our shit.

DAE NASA is a federal agency? Perhaps this user mistook it for NSA.

&gt;Except for the lack of results in new human spaceflight capability for the last 25 years.

Fortunately someone points out the International Space Station to contradict this nonsense.

------------------------------------------------------------------

But it's time to stop living in the past. Reddit is forward-looking and has some exciting and novel ideas to revitalize America's space program:

&gt;We really need to get the Space shuttle and constellation program going again.

Boldly go by retreading the old. At least someone points out that American government-funded human spaceflight is not actually gone as the Constellation program was replaced with the Space Launch System currently under development.

&gt;What we really need is for the U.S. to swap the NASA and Military budgets.

This is a highly realistic and nuanced solution with guaranteed positive results for the American people. Why doesn't the government just read Reddit when they need to plan things?!

&gt;I feel like if I were in NASA I would totally try to sell ""The next frontier of war"" to the Government to try and pry more funding. We all know those corrupt, rich, profiteering old folks love to throw money and stuff that kills people.

The government has literally never considered military applications of aerospace technology before.

&gt;SPACE BATTLES

&gt;SO MUCH YES

I don't know about you, but I definitely want large vehicles firing high explosives at each other in near orbit and sending countless pieces of heavy metal wreckage plummeting down on populated areas. That definitely wouldn't be a product of the military-industrial complex. Just think of all the *Star Wars* allusions Reddit would then be able to make!

&gt;NASA cant do anything efficient enough, they are outsourcing/increasing funding to the private industry who can do it cheaper and faster

I wonder if this user is aware that government space tech development, or aviation tech development of any kind for that matter, have always included private outsourcing. This is not new.

&gt;why have we not colonized mars yet

Someone explains that there hasn't really been a reason to do so as yet, but then goes on to set up a dichotomy between civilian and military applications being the driving force for all of NASA's projects, with the latter being the only ""real"" purpose and that it was ""never about science."" Never mind that NASA has continued to exist for 20 post-Cold War years and never mind that the International Space Station functions as a research laboratory and never mind that the American taxpayer has sent various robots to Mars for which the sole purpose has been to study the environment of a planet dead for eons.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Full disclosure (perhaps I should use a bravery bear maymay): I think NASA is a good organization and would be okay with increased funding/grander mission vision for the agency, preferably for peaceful purposes with continued international cooperation. I have a degree in an aerospace field and am an aspiring aerospace engineer with the goal of working in or with NASA someday; that being said I'm only a student currently and want to be clear that I don't mean to speak as if I have real expertise on either the agency or spaceflight.

But as usual, I think the topic has been oversimplified here and we are therefore left with what I see as a microcosm of the usual jerks: lamentations about the expansion of the ""modern"" defense industry but ignoring the fact that developing new weapons including *weapons of mass destruction* was certainly a major concern during the tense years of the Cold War, misunderstanding the cancellation of the shuttle program as a permanent end to human space transport as a NASA mission, and putting forward ideas that are unfeasible, not innovative, or don't have a point that can be justified beyond making science fiction reality.

I think the first one is pointed to a degree, the second one is flat out incorrect, and the final one shows enthusiasm but is frankly lacking in knowledge and not particularly contributory to discourse. I favor renewed national support for civilian scientific development even if the only result is merely increasing human knowledge, but simply funding le NASA instead of le military is not going to usher in the United Federation of Planets.",Effort Post,False,,t5_2tzax,1375131154.0,,,True,t3_1jat9b,http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/1jat9b/all_systems_are_go_for_launching_a/,

It's all classic internet tough guy.

&gt;I would wait until he has a car and is out for the day and sell that. Very easy to do and if it's a cheap first car you should get your money back, I would leave the change after buying a new console and the games back.

Yep, let's just steal his car.

&gt;I'm not saying you should sedate him, perform crude bathtub surgery, and sell his kidneys to cover the costs.
But you should sedate him, perform crude bathtub surgery, and sell his kidneys to cover the costs.

Something, something, disproportionate response.

&gt;No no no no, you gotta play smart, don't sink to his level and steal stuff, no! You gotta make him feel bad about it, brag about your success and mention his failures in life as much as possible, drive him into deep soul crushing depression and get him to suicide so you won't have to split your parents stuff when they bite the dust.

Yep, let's just force someone who's obviously got some issues (see the rest of the thread,) into suicide for stealing a playstation.

&gt;Disagree with this. don't just let it slide, but don't take revenge either. stay diplomatic and sort it out, you need to be repayed and he needs to learn his lesson. He sold your property and kept the money for himself leaving you with nothing. Also, letting it slide will not alter your brothers behaviour, and he'll pull this kind of thing off with someone else in the future. Best he get's taught a lesson now to prevent further theft.

Finally, a decent response.

&gt;Just so you know, if you don't exact equal, or greater, revenge, you'll qualify as a fully fledged pussy.

Maturity, what's that?

&gt;Get some weed, or cocaine (or weed, and cocaine), and plant it in his bag, or in his car.
Then when you know he's out of the house, and you know where he is go to a payphone and call in an anonymous tip to get your brother arrested.
Or, when he's sleeping get an electric fan, turn it on, and point the fan towards him. He'll die, and no one will blame OP.

Yep, let's just send someone to jail.

Elsewhere in the thread, OP talks about stealing his phone and throwing it into a lake, to extract 'revenge.' This is the /r/justiceporn mentality at work - justice is simple revenge.

Personally, I didn't watch the debates. I don't subscribe to a lot the bullshit 2 party system in this country so I don't necessarily find any value in watching two idiots bloviate for a couple hours jerking one another off and cumming into the eyes of Americans.

What I really find interesting is that it appears that Romney's team scored more home runs than Obama's team did touchdowns, or something or other or....

I didn't get a chance to catch the boxscore of last nights match, but according to Reddit (whose pants are literally on fire), Romney scored a knockout punch or some such. We know this because Rachel Maddow. For a completely unbiased, professional and thought provoking discussion on exactly how the debate went last night, it's goddamn apparent that the number one source to start said discussion is on curiously cute Rachel Maddow's blog. 

It's not FOX, right?

MSNBC. The ""major"" corporate news machine that cried foul at Bush's illegal wars, but remained curiously quiet when Obama started bombing (illegally) Libya. Don't worry, there's nothing to see here. 

Of course, since Reddit is the Mecca for the political thought-police, whose knowledge and power are unending and unquestionable, you can imagine that the comments section of this little peach is a treasure trove. There is almost a reserved and depressed feel in the comments section, as the beaten-wife syndrome having Obama supporters are trying to figure out what exactly went wrong last night. I'll post a few gems that tickled my balls:

[This guy should quit his dayjob and become a campaign manager](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/10xkrf/and_as_it_turns_out_winning_a_debate_is/c6hja7h)

[Calling a spade a spade is now Reddit's new favorite cliche](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/10xkrf/and_as_it_turns_out_winning_a_debate_is/c6hjoqi)

[Romney broke the rules. Obama should have taken his ball and just went home](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/10xkrf/and_as_it_turns_out_winning_a_debate_is/c6hjo4h)

[TIL Romney invented the word lie much like Gore invented the internet, and Obama promised to get rid of Guantanamo](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/10xkrf/and_as_it_turns_out_winning_a_debate_is/c6hhv55)


I donno, guys. This goes on for what seems like forever. I could sit here all day and pick a lot of these apart, but I'll let you do that. I'm sure most of you have seem this thread already. 

What I learned:

* **Only Romney lies**
* **Obama is infallible**
* **All of Reddit are campaign managers**
* **Romney won because Obama's strategy was to let him win**
* **Fuck this place**


**EDIT**
[The unashamedly unbiased New York Times, too, is a respectable place to get your analysis of last night's debates](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/opinion/an-unhelpful-presidential-debate.html?_r=0)

[This Canadian is on to something. Not a chirp from the hivemind about the debates, surprisingly. Had Obama won, the front page would have been filled with victory gifs](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10xol3/as_a_canadian_i_was_quite_surprised_to_see_so/)

I should note that this is my first post. I've been lurking and commenting here and there on CB and CB2 for a couple months now, but felt like I was an odd man out. Like I wouldn't really belong. Fuck that. First post. Hope it's OK and follows the rules.

I guess Reddit needs a new witch to burn at the stake. Karmanaut doesn't comment enough to quench the thirst of the neckbearded downvoting brigades of Reddit - so when SupermanV2 deleted the OAG IAMA, they found their new target. I know this has been covered before here (or was it CB ?) but I just went through SupermanV2's profile and **everything** is heavily downvoted.. I just had to let off steam about it.

Will these friggin Redditors ever grow up? Why oh why oh why....
