Some guy took a spark to the eye today and went to the hospital. He's fine, but god damn you guys.

I've been to the hospital on 3 separate occasions for getting shit in my eyes; the first I had no eyewear. 2nd and 3rd I had my safety glasses and my faceshield on. Other than those, I've had to flush my eyes out about half a dozen different times. I understand that sometimes you just get into the wrong angle and something falls in, it happens to us all. But don't let negligence be the cause.

To all you new guys, here's the procedure for getting a sliver of steel out of your eye:

You wait in the hospital (I've never waited more than 30 minutes, they take this shit seriously). The doctor comes in, and drops a few things in. First is a numbing agent, the second is a dye that glows in the dark. Lights go off (Thank god, because that eye is super sensitive now), and then turns a bright light on right into your eye (whelp, now it hurts again) to let that dye shine. 

Next he proceeds to pluck at your eye with a needle...a fucking needle! And no, you can't blink. Sure your eye is numbed but you are tearing up, and try to not blink when you are thinking of it. Next, he has to get rid of that rust ring in your eye...because those salty tears and steel just mix so well. How does he did this? A weee miny Die-Grinder. I shit you not. He uses a fucking die grinder to take away that rust ring and takes a layer of your cornea off in the process.

If you're lucky, he doesn't patch up your eye. But you have to put drops in your eye for the next few days. 

Oh and god forbid you go during the evening. That specialist ain't going to be there, so you have to come back the next day at best, which means you're sleeping with that little fucker in your eye.

Please...wear your god damn safety glasses.",,False,self,t5_2serw,False,,,True,t3_1eth8t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1eth8t/just_a_friendly_reminder/,

There should be no question about this.

***IF YOU ARE WELDING INDOORS AND YOU HAVE NO SMOKE-EATER YOU SHOULD BE WEARING A RESPIRATOR.***

That said, it's insanely bothersome if you're in a shop and having to talk to co-workers through a respirator which is why OHAs tend to place it last on their recommendations for shop policies.

Other methods of air control are preferable, be it sufficient airflow through the shop floor or localized smoke hoods.

Certain methods are advisable to wear a respirator even if you've got sufficient air control, galv, stainless, plasma cutting, etc.

Also, and this gets ignored more often than wearing it during welding, but grinding produces a LOT if extremely fine particulates that remain suspended in air for longer than you might expect.  When you're grinding stainless or aluminum, in particular: PIO.

I've listed these things before in other posts, but here they are again for those who are unaware of your inhalant risks:

[Manganese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganism) 7018, ER70s-6 in particular are high in manganese, but most electrodes have it.

Cadmium

Chromium

Iron

Copper

Aluminum

Zinc

Silica

Titanium

CO

CO^2

SO^2

We'll add to the list as we go, and add links as I have time.

Periodically, welders should be doing two things, health-wise:  Blood check for heavy metals and other contaminants and an eye exam (NOT a vision check) for ocular health.

1370660115.0,26,self.Welding,1fwmtc,Welcome to all the new folks.,ecclectic,27,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1fwmtc/welcome_to_all_the_new_folks/,"Well, there are a few new hundred new subscribers, hooray and welcome to you all, I hope you enjoy what you find here, questions are always welcome, some have already been answered in the [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/wiki/index) though that's a working document, so it changes on occasion.

A few things we would appreciate:

* Please, keep things civil.  You don't need to be PC, but outright racism, bigotry and general assholishness is not something we would like to see here.
* Sometimes people ask questions that are easy to google.  If you have a correct answer and some insight please share it. Search results can be a bit of a sewer, people sometimes just need to hear from another person, or be able to ask follow up questions.
* Petty bickering should be taken to private messages.  It happens, people say something stupid and conversations escalate.  If you're not contributing to the conversation, but attacking someone, take it elsewhere.
* Try, where you can, to back up what you say.  Welding is as much science as it is art, as such there is plenty of information available out there to use as a reference.
* cut people some slack.  Some of us work in rough conditions and are exhausted when we get home, we may say things that are confusing, stupid or just plain wrong.
* downvoting should more or less follow [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) with one notable exception: because of the nature of welding, if you disagree with something, downvoting is promoted, PROVIDED you can give reasoning or offer a counter point.

I've probably forgotten something, if you have any **constructive** suggestions, I'd like to hear about it.

My bitch today: I moved in with my dad, in hopes to get work down here in the North Texas oil patch. The first week I was here, I stepped in to the only welding shop in 30 miles, and talked with the owner. He seemed eager to hire me -they had a lot of work. Starting 25/hour!

Well, over the next two weeks, we play phone tag. So, I decide to step in to his office. Instead of him, I meet his wife. We're both equally shocked to see each other, and she immediately jumps on the defence: What do you want with *my husband*. Fuck. I just want a job. ""Doing *what*."" I'm dumbfounded. All they do is weld. I hear a guy grinding in the shop beyond the office wall. I gesture towards the sound, confused, and say ""Um, welding?"" Well, he's gone on a job, she huffs. I say thanks and leave. Whooboy, that was stupid awkward and aggresive.

The next time I called him, he flat out hung up on me as soon as I said who I was.

I gave up on that, and now I'm stuck in a rut. That was the 4th job to fall through in two months: 2 jobs I could not afford to go and test for, 1 was a night position that I could not schedule a baby sitter around (single mom), and the last, most recent one, I'm certain fell through because of my gender and a jealous wife in an insecure relationship.",PSA,False,self,t5_2serw,False,PSA,,True,t3_1hw1a3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1hw1a3/well_fuck_i_have_to_bitch_what_do_you_need_to/,

It's unclear at this point if the guy will keep his leg, or walk again.  They were flipping a big chunk of 3/8"" plate and channel over to weld the top down when the magnet failed and dropped the load.  The dude was between the table and the load, and it fell 3' and toppled over.

It was a project I was working on, but I was getting more material when they did the lift.  Had I been there, I would have told the dude to move to a place where he wasn't going to be pinned.  I wouldn't have used a magnet to turn a load, I would have use a pad eye.

1369499164.0,19,self.Welding,1f19gd,Update on that job interview a while back (advice for new guys inside),Maple-Whisky,21,2,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1f19gd/update_on_that_job_interview_a_while_back_advice/,"So about 6-8 weeks ago I made a post asking for SMAW tips because I had a job interview...hadn't done SMAW for quite a while, however at one point I did hold my tickets for it.

I get to this job interview and it turns out the guy needed a MIG welder. Well shit, I've been MIG welding since I got out of college with the odd stick here and there. I wanted a stick job, I wanted to be working in the field. I felt so let down and had a feeling that unless I went back to school to get my stick down I wouldn't be able to get a job (over reaction). 

Funny things happen though..at the interview the owners buddy walks in who was running his own mobile welding company. We talked a bit, found out he knew people from my old job (the owners) and heard it was a hard place to work for (it truly was).. and after a week of hearing nothing, I passed that opportunity to the side and forgot about it *sigh* I'll be a MIG welder my whole life. But this guy called me back. Said I could come down anytime I wanted and practice...and when I'm good enough he'll certify me for all-position. 

After about another month of waiting and getting some practice in, he says Monday I start. I can't respect this guy enough. I'm super excited for this opportunity and plan to work my ass off to earn it.

So, to the new guys out there...be patient. Build up a reputation, the welding community is small in any given city. I know people who know people who know guys I worked with years ago...you've heard of 6 degrees of separation? The welding community is probably 3 degrees of separation. 

There ARE people out there willing to help you do what you want to do, but don't let them down. At my old job, we'd hire people who had NEVER welded in their life and teach them. One of those guys owns the company. It's all about your attitude and willingness to work hard and learn. And you need to take criticism from some tough people.",,False,self,t5_2serw,False,,,True,t3_1f19gd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1f19gd/update_on_that_job_interview_a_while_back_advice/,

I have always been fascinated with welding and have always wanted to learn how. To help get me started my dad helped me out with a small Oxyacetylene setup and a [Lincoln Power Mig 180 Dual](http://www.lincolnelectric.com/en-us/Equipment/Pages/product.aspx?product=K3018-2%28LincolnElectric%29) and it came with the ready pack with auto darkening helmet, gloves and welding shirt. My school also provides us with a BSX welding pack, jacket, helmet, gloves, vice grips, C-clamps and misc. tools. So needless to say I think I'm covered for tools and gear for right now I'm just excited to start welding and making things. I'm sure I'll be asking some questions and hopefully sharing some pictures of the progress. We just started Oxyacetylene cutting and beveling and hopefully will be moving on to SMAW soon.

I was on a job in Port Hudson, Louisiana, at a paper mill back in 2000.
I may have been there for about 2 weeks prior to the company hiring more welders and fitters for the upcoming shutdown. We were working in the fab shop, that's normally where we would take our breaks during lunch as well. There would be different new hires come to the fab shop and look around. This certain day a welder strolled in, Lapco welding shirt with so much starch ironed in that it look like sheet metal. Jeans were the same way, boots with no scuff marks. All pipe welders I've met are envious to see someone in the fab shop welding on sch10 SS butt welds, including myself. I can't remember his comments about my welding exactly, he came off a little arrogant although he did not criticize my work. 
Lunch time came around, we were all getting our lunch boxes out and finding the right spot to sit and relax. This guy, was taking off his welding shirt. Low and behold, we seen he had a tattoo on his arm  ""Golden Arm"" 

For those who haven't heard that term, I've heard it in the industry used to describe a ""jam up"" welder that's exceptional.  a welder who's stainless welds are as close to perfect as you can get.

Come to find out, this guy hasn't been welding long just out of welding school.     My fitter said, ""by the looks of his welding, the tattoo should have been Black Arm""

As an ongoing joke, I wrote ""Black Arm"" on my Tillman gloves as well as my welding Hood. The Golden Arm tattoo guy seen it later, ""oh I can't believe you wrote that on your hood man""! As if It determined my skills, by having a nick name like that. ",,False,self,t5_2serw,False,,,True,t3_1i9xr5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1i9xr5/we_all_know_prima_donna_welders/,

Every shop has had at least on person seriously injured by a grinder inccident, sometimes it's because of freak chance, sometimes it's misuse and abuse, more often than not, it's stupidity ([see James F.

Guards are a pain in the ass.  There's no question of that, and sometimes, you're doing work where the only function it serves is to direct the sparks into the one place you don't want them to go. 

If you're doing finishing work, lets face it, talk to your supervisor, you may get away with removing them.  It you're cutting, using a stone or doing something that has the potential to shatter or eject large matter at high velocity, it's stupid to refuse to protect yourself.

Additions, revisions, corrections and criticisms requested; I'll try to update daily or at least every 2 days.


**How do I become a welder?**

Find a shop in your area willing to hire you on as a helper; or, more productively, consult your local union hall or trades/community college.

[AWS school finder](http://www.aws.org/w/e/)

[CWA school listing](http://www.cwa-acs.org/weldinginstitutions.html)

If you're looking to learn for hobby or pick up some extra tips to get through a troubling procedure, check out http://www.weldingtipsandtricks.com/

**What do I need to know to start welding**

Basic safety, understand that you can be killed while welding.

There are a number of long term health issues with welding, exposure to hazardous fumes, chemicals, and elements.  PPE is there for your safety, and well-being not because you're a pussy. 

Tool safety, take a welding course, this should be covered in the first 2 days.  If you're having a go of it on your own, RTFM. 

Welding is hot, dirty difficult work.  Welders are often as not called on to do a variety of jobs along with welding, usually fabricating, fitting, grinding, and cutting but you never know what else you'll have to do to get your job done.
Working in 40 degree heat or welding on a casting that's 200 degrees for 8 hours, welding in a 4x4x4 foot box or gouging a 20' seam.  Sometimes its monotonous, mentally exhausting but at the end of the day, worth it.

If you're working in the field, you're going to be dragging cables through everything, it gets heavy, it gets dirty.

Its a trade, you do the job till it's done, because you get compensated for it fairly.  

Even when welds are not critical, your supervisors and co-workers will be.  A poor weld reflects badly on a whole shop and no one should want to let it go out the door. Don't take it personally, just take it into consideration and learn from the mistakes made.

**Terminology**

*[GMAW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GMAW)* - Gas Metal Arc welding (MIG/MAG).  A solid wire is energized and fed at a constant velocity establishing an electric arc between the gun and base metal. An inert gas, typically a combination of Argon and Carbon Dioxide is required to protect and maintain the arc and molten weld pool.

High deposition of metal, but requires fairly specific and clean conditions, typically used in shops, though occasionally seen in use with field operations.

There are 3 general transfer modes:

1  Short circuit: low wire speed,  low voltage.  

2  Globular: high voltage, low wire speed. 

3  Spray arc: High voltage, moderate wire speed

*[FCAW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux-cored_arc_welding)* - Flux Cored Arc welding. similar to GMAW with the exception that instead of a solid wire a metal tube is filled with chemicals and elements with varying properties is used.  

High deposition of metal and excellent penetration. Used in shops and in field.

Dual-shield requires a gas to be used in addition, typically carbon dioxide alone or mixed with argon Very strong welds with excellent penetration can be achieved.  

Self shielding FCAW electrodes do not require any gas, but produce a great deal of spatter and the welds are typically not as strong as dual shield.

*MCAW* - Metal Core Arc Welding Sort of a combination of GMAW and FCAW, utilizing an iron powder in a tube rather than flux.  
Very high deposition rates and good penetration. Typically used in shops.

*[GTAW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTAW)* - Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (TIG) [Tungsten](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten) which has the second highest melting point all elements is used to create an electrical arc, melting the base metal into which you feed a rod made of nearly identical alloy.
Slow deposition, but produces extremely strong, beautiful welds.  Used in shops or in field under controlled conditions.


*[SMAW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shielded_metal_arc_welding)* - Shielded Metal Arc Welding (Stick) A metal alloy rod is covered with flux consisting of a variety of anti-oxidants, fillers, and other protective chemicals.  The flux melts and forms a protective barrier against the atmosphere to create a strong weld.
Medium deposition (with the exception of 7024,) wide versatility, usable in almost any situation with rods developed to weld almost any metal possible in almost any position.

*PPE* - Personal Protective Equipment - Steel toes boots, safety glasses, beanie, gloves, coveralls/leathers, ear plugs, respirator.  Welding is a dangerous, this stuff is there to protect you.

If you're welding in confined spaces, 

a. Don't do it without proper confined space training.

b. make sure there is a forced air system in place to remove smoke and supply fresh air.

*how can I cut...*

Mild or carbon steel?

Just about any way you can imagine.  Oxy-fuel and plasma are the fastest manual methods, with reinforced cut-off discs coming in 3rd.

Oxy-fuel, plasma, laser, water, shearing, and sawing are the common machine assisted methods.

Stainless steels? 

Stainless steels can be cut via friction or toothed saws, using low blade speed and consistent feed speeds, sheared (75% of shear capacity, meaning if your shear can cut 1/2 plate, you can shear 3/8 SS,) plasma, laser or water cut.  Plasma is the most widely used and if done correctly will leave a good edge.  Laser and water cutting typically requires a CNC machine.

[A discussion of underwater welding](http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/11hnsq/so_lets_talk_about_underwater_welding/)

**can you weld aluminum with steel filler?**

Short answer, no

Long answer; it can be done using specialized techniques and machinery, so for 99% of situations, no.

Friction stir welding can fuse steel and aluminum as can cold metal transfer welding.    
Friction stir is a CNC process, CMT can be either manual or automated but requires a special setup.

The one I'm looking at comes with hose and regulator, and looking at the manual, it seems an argon/CO2 mix would be best for me.

After looking at the different types of welders available, I settled upon an entry level stick welder because it seemed to be the most versatile and easy to pick up.  I built a little [platform](http://i.imgur.com/YLKCIAW.jpg) so I can lager beer in my keggerator.  Anyhow, there are a few more small projects I want to do, and one involves using aluminum.  I ordered some E4043 Aluminium rods from Mcmaster-Carr and and picked up some remnants from the local metal shop.  I've heard this is tricky, but I barely get the arc to start.  Once I get the arc going, I can't keep it going for more than a second and it appears I can't even penetrate the base metal.  From what I understand, Aluminum has a significantly lower melting point than steel, but it also has much ~~higher~~ lower electrical resistance so it just makes it tricky to weld.  The thing is, I can't even lay a bead at all.

I seem to have everything set up right.  The rods are 3/32"", 50 - 80 Amps.  I have dialed my welder in to a variety of amperages in that range, though I seem to only make any headway when I have it set between 70 and 80 amps.  I've tried both electrode positive and electrode negative, though the information sheet that came with the rods say electrode positive only.  What could I be doing wrong?  Is it possible the piece of scrap I have isn't a weldable alloy, or is stick welding aluminum just more trouble than it's worth? 

**Edit:**  Thank you guys so much for all the tips!

I've worked in a family machine shop since I was 12 years old, summers, college breaks, and now full time for 5 years. And have learned machining quite thoroughly but one aspect we never breached into was welding; we've mainly used off site welding companies or friends to do a lot of our work.

So my questions are; 

Is taking one of those 2 month courses worth it? I was also offered lessons from a 30 year veteran railway welder.


Thinking of picking up a miller 211, as I hear its pretty dependable and would be great to start off on. What is your opinion on it?

So I cut off a bit off a barbell and welded it onto one side of a dumbbell so that I could fit 3 extra plates instead of having to buy larger size plates.  Using the 90A HF flux core welder.

Gave the finished dumbbell a go and nothing broke, and my previous welds on 3/16"" steel seemed very strong so I have trust in this.  I ground down the edge of each piece to get deeper penetration and more filler material in.

I know this is a pretty silly and easy thing by pros' standards, but I felt like sharing :)  Have to put my welder to use and I'm searching for stuff to weld.

As in any other field of work, many of the terms we use are unknown and foreign.  This is something I wish to address with this post.  

I will continue to edit the main post as I think of, or am informed of terms.

* Arc length:  The distance you keep your tungsten or stick from the work.  The larger the gap, the more heat you get.

* Work:  The thing you are welding.

* Stick:  A type of welding, SMAW (Stick Metal Arc Welding) or; a length of metal ~21' feet long.

* Root:  The first weld done, or the un-welded fit.

* Fitting:  The process of getting everything in the proper alignment to tack up and weld.

* Tack:  A small weld to hold two bits of metal in proper place.

* Tig:  Tungsten Inert Gas.

* MIG:  Metal Inert Gas, aka wire feed.

* Flux-Core:  A wire feed method of welding that has flux inside the wire.

* Dual Shield:   A wire feed method of welding that combines flux-core wire with shielding gas.

* Flux:  An organic that is designed to burn during the welding process to provide a shielding gas and provide different effects upon the weld.  Flux is complex, and requires an entire post of it's own.

1358912545.0,11,self.Welding,173o2u,Welding through paint - Newer welder,theworkaround,13,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/173o2u/welding_through_paint_newer_welder/,"So some background - I'm a pretty young guy who took a year off college to work as a welder. My father, who is an experienced welder, was/has been my sole instructor. I've been a hobby welder for a while, but wasn't any good until this summer and I've been working since October. I should also mention that I weld MIG, although I've been trying to teach myself stick.

So, I need to know, how bad is it to weld through paint or undercoat? I mainly repair/modify dump trucks and the general consensus at the shop is to just burn or melt through it. At first it was really difficult - everything splattered - but I'm at the point where I can mostly lay dimes with .045 unless the coat is especially thick or it's an awkward position. If it looks good can I assume it's strong or will the paint/undercoat interfere with the weld?

Also, how much should I worry about the fumes? My dad was always a hardass-oldschool type and never wears a mask when he welds. Clean metal I never really wore anything but with the undercoat it can get pretty bad - I currently use N95 disposable masks. 

**EDIT:** I took a couple pictures of what I did yesterday. I know I sped up towards the end of the horizontal weld, and the ugly start on the vertical is because of the paint. Once the weld is hot, paint about 1/4-3/8"" in front of the bead starts burning, so it's a little cleaner by the time it gets there. 

http://imgur.com/a/KvM2k

I am aware these aren't perfect, I was told to rush on this. I didn't have time to do something else to make an example picture.

Also - the vast majority of the paint and all undercoat is black, if that gives any indication to their compositions. Occasionally the paint is white. Other colors are very rare; the most recent was metallic green roughly two weeks ago.",,False,self,t5_2serw,1358993869.0,,,True,t3_173o2u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/173o2u/welding_through_paint_newer_welder/,

What I've gathered is that you can braze steel to steel so long as you are using brass or bronze + flux. However I've seen a rather large back and forth about brazing making for a stronger hold versus a weaker hold.

I came home and my eyes felt a little grainy, but didnt hurt too bad slept it off

I went out and bought a Jackson Pro Variable auto dark hood before my next class

I havent been flashed since in the last 3 classes, and I have been really trying to avoid other people in other booths


The problem is my eyes still feel kind of buggy, they feel like I have have been up all night and have bags under my eyes.

Its been 2 days since my last class, and I was using the metal shear all class (which is far away from the booths, not much chance of getting flashed by someone else, and my safety glasses are supposed to block 99% of UVs anyways), and laid maybe 2-3 stringers out

Should I still be feeling effects? 
I have light blue eyes so the lack of pigment supposedly makes them more sensitive 

Im doing this as a hobby, not a job
If I cant get this under control im going to just drop this class, my eyes havent felt ""right"" in 2 weeks

Usually I'm doing one-off custom jobs, but today it was pure production.

As I'm welding each joint I realize that my welds are coming out terrible; bubbly cauldrons of porosity that pop all over.  For this job it's shwag hot-rolled metal so I thought that maaaaaaybe it was such low quality that I was getting too many impurities.  But this went on for awhile.

Check gas PSI: looks good

Check torch parts: looks good

Let's get simpler - is my ground hooked up well?  YUP!

Hrm... are all the connections good?  YUP!

Ok, let's get some nice cold rolled steel and see how that welds.  CURSES!  MORE BUBBLING!

Well now I'm at my wit's end.  What could is possible be?  Every setting is right, every connection is right, everything in theory should work.  It worked fine when I left the night before!



Then it dawned on me.  Someone else was using it afterhours for a side project.  I go to look... 75% Argon 25% CO2.  That was it.  As simple as that... the guy last night put the wrong tank on.  Why he didn't notice the bad weld is beyond me!!!

This isn't so much of a ""how do I do this"" question, which the sidebar clearly has links to, it's more of a ""is it worth my time"" question.

I design and build dobsonian telescopes as a hobby ([#1](http://imgur.com/a/VqbSX) and [#2](http://imgur.com/a/IGk5O) thus far), which are 90% woodwork and a tiny bit of metal.

The welding involved is as follows: 

Telescope #1, very basic design: [setup](http://i.imgur.com/7eGo8.jpg), [done](http://i.imgur.com/aSGcQ.jpg), [in position](http://i.imgur.com/nR2q4.jpg)

Telescope #2, much more advanced (to 1/16"" precision) design: [setup](http://i.imgur.com/TFKzaaI.jpg), [done](http://i.imgur.com/89vK5RI.jpg), [backside](http://i.imgur.com/AVMBxrF.jpg), [with mirror](http://i.imgur.com/dZJCikT.jpg).

The first one I had done by a friend for free, the second weld I took to a local blacksmith and paid him $60 for the job due to the precision involved.

**My questions:**

1. Knowing absolutely NOTHING whatsoever about welding, if I make more of these, is it worth my time to get the equipment and learn to weld to do this piecework?

2. Could I pull off the precision required in mirror cell #2 as a novice welder? I have some wiggle room for thick mirrors, but not for thin ones. (I'm not kidding, those support points have to be exactly straight, flat, and in the right spot, or the mirror supports are out of balance and it damages the image for thinner mirrors.)

3. (Sidebar question.) I would absolutely love to be able to work aluminum, but from my limited understanding, welding aluminum is expensive/hard, right? I don't even know where to begin, except that really crazy builds like [this one](http://www.astrotreff.de/topic.asp?ARCHIVE=true&amp;TOPIC_ID=103286) seem to be joined without welding.

I recently met with the James and Patrick from WorkHands and will be working with them as a consultant (they didn't know I'm a redditor, but I guess they will after this). I have been in the trades since I graduated high school, I am currently a Journey Fitter (also attending welding classes at my local community college) and have been involved in industrial construction (refineries, rock plants, food plants, pipelines, etc) having worked all over the United States (Northern/Southern California, Utah, Washington, Louisiana, Mississippi, etc) for 10 years. Believe me when I tell you, I would not be making this post or helping them develop their website if I did not believe they are truly dedicated to helping evolve the trade industry. They have a great concept and are looking for input to help develop the website to help, us, the craftsman. I don't know how much I can divulge, I don't even know if they will be okay with me making this post (I guess I'll find out soon enough), but what I can tell you is that if things go even remotely close to what we have been discussing, making a gazillion calls or going shop to shop to shop (company to company to company) attempting to gain employment, will become a thing of the past.

So, having typed all that, give the company a chance, their intent is to help us find employment, something that we all know is difficult to do nowadays, whether you are a 30 year vet or a welder's helper n00b. 

*edit: spelling and grammar

*edit 2: If things go as planned the site will help many new welders reach out to industrial contractors directly and better their chances of finding employment as a pipe welder.

I have one of those cheap tiny chinese stick welders (90amps, dc only, inverter power supply) and figured if I built the electrodes I could hook it up and use it as the power supply. I built a pair of copper electrodes on arms that hinge, just like a normal portable spot welder. However when I hook it up to the welder and run current through it, basically nothing happens other than the metal getting a little warm. I've hooked up the clamp meter and there's about 60 amps running through it, DC. No matter what I set the amperage knob to, it runs 60 amps. If I lift up the electrodes so there's a little arc, then it melts right through the metal (burning holes). 

Am I going about this totally the wrong way? Is a 90 amp stick welder just not going to work as a power supply?

Today a know-it-all punk got to see that I am fully capable, and willing to ruin your day if you cross a line.

It is crunch time on a big order.  Some 100+ tons of steel in various states of holes drilled, bits welded all clogging up the line.  Limited budget, so no overtime.  Time to turn and burn your quota in an 8.  Not a time to fuck around.

Stage set.  Lots of welders in close, all using air grinders.  First time he replaced my nos with 100 psi of air I informed him, politely, of his mistake.  The second time I barked at him.  Third time I left a bruise on his arm with my gun.

He thought that was a challenge, it was not.  It was a warning.  As the next hour progressed, he turned my machine off while I was welding, turned the volts up, and then finally crossed the line.  He turned my gas off during a critical structural weld that is impossible to grind out.  The joking ended.

I proceeded to set his welder to spot times of .3 seconds or 8.  Wait until his lid was down and tapped his fit out of place, bump his arm while he was welding, turn the crane off while he was picking a load, hide his wire brush etc.  

By the end of the day, he was shaking mad at me.  I made 5 hours of his day a living hell.  He miss his part of the quota, and got hell from the pit-boss.  But I picked up the slack, and let him know it.

Don't be that new guy, know your place.  If I don't know it all after 10 years, you don't.  Listen and keep your trap shut.

/rant

EDIT:

I didn't mean to hit him hard enough to inflict a bruise.  Miller 350 guns are heavy, and I was pissed.  My bad, lesson learned.

I tolerated his shit for 2 hours, and only snapped when his 'prank' crossed the line.  I had to scrap 400 lbs. of steel, an hour of my my time, and make excuses to the plant manager to cover his ass.  Before you ask, yes it could have been salvaged, but my company lacks the tools I needed to fix it.  It's the ~~redacted~~ way.

None of my hazing resulted in any cost to the company.  I worked harder and faster to cover for the loss of productivity I was causing.

The entire event was intended to make him look the fool, without causing any safety hazards or monetary loss.  Yesterday, he wouldn't talk to me.  Today, he had cooled off enough for me to explain the why.  He understands his error, and I think will be more mindful of his environment and actions.

Anyone else in my shop would have subjected him to sadistic levels of torture that would have ended in him quitting welding before he could get fired.  He is talented, but has a thin skin.

I am confident in my stick welding, I've done different sizes and kinds of electrodes, and an ability to make a damn sexy 1/8"" 6010 horizontal open root pass.

My welds are quite good high heat (roughly 450ipm/28v, although this is with .045) and even lower heat ranges, if it is a flat weld.

My problem is that I can't remember decent heat settings to weld properly without getting massive amount of spatter, or taking too much time fiddling with settings on scrap metal.

I don't think my mig has enough balls to spray, and if it does, it will only be 0.035"" wire. I may grab a wire feeder for my engine-drive, and go from there.

Anyone with tons of experience with AR500 plate? Supposedly each joint needs to be pre-heated to 300, interpass under 400.

Each sheet of 4'x8' ar500 needs to be welded on all 4 sides (24 linear feet) and also welded to a 3""x3""x3/8"" angle iron frame work.

There will be 2 ramps converging on a space around 5'4"" off the ground, leading at 11 degrees. 56' wide, around 30' long from floor to point, and another at roof to point. Think a giant horizontal funnel.

I need to make the framework to support the ramp from floor to point on the roof, then place each sheet, and do 100% penetration weld on every joint.

I was thinking of setting up an automated jig with a drill and my plasma, so I can just set it down on a sheet, turn on the plasma and drill, and let it run at the bevel angle the length of the joint. I'd lay 2 sheets on the 4' edges together, and a single for the 8' edge.

That would save me from manually beveling that ~3000 feet, and any grinding touchups on that same 3,000 feet. My plasma can go around 1.2""/second mirror smooth through 3/8"" plate.

I'm thinking a 60"" bevel, knife edged or 1/16"" land, 3/8"" gap between plates, so I can burn into the angle framework and tie it all together.

Secondly, what skills should I have down before I walk into the union hall?

I've been enjoying this subreddit the last couple days, and thought I'd ask some questions with some background info first. Sorry for it being a bit wordy!  

I got into welding when I decided to restore a 1957 Chevy Pickup in my last year of college (totally unrelated field). I knew nothing about cars or welding when I started and the vehicle is now nearing completion. To call it a rust-bucket originally is being generous. Much of the metal needed replaced.  

At first, I had no welding equipment so I pop-riveted metal. That was awful. I then used my dad's stick welder, and seeing as he only had one kind of rod and I didn't know much about it, that was also awful. Only the thickest metal on the car could be welded, and even then it blew holes unless it was ~1/4"". My father later acquired a oxyacetylene brazing torch and that was much better. I was able to hammer metal into various shapes and braze it into place. But that was still a bit of work as far as consistency.  

Recently I bought myself a small MIG, namely this one: http://tinyurl.com/9wmxo7t  

I LOVE IT! I am a cheapskate so I used some special fittings and a Harbor Freight CO2 regulator to switch it over to CO2. It's much better than flux-core but I know that the argon/co2 mix is ideal. I'll eventually switch to it if I get more serious, but I homebrew keg beer, so I already had the CO2 tanks. I started out with welding frames and such for my garage using 1"" sq. tubing, and have now used it to fabricate and replace pieces on the truck I never dreamed I could replace. Just on the first day using it I was easily able to weld two pieces of 1/16"" steel side by side, edge to edge with no overlap. Put it in the vise and beat the hell out of it with a sledge just to see if it worked, and it wouldn't break apart. I'm still in awe of that, after only being able to work with thick metal for a few years now.  

So, as far as DIY, and at home projects I'm absolutely loving this MIG and welding. When I'm doing bondo / body work, I wish I was welding. When I'm doing carpentry, I wish I was welding.  

But I come on here, and see these perfect puddles from you guys. The best I've been able to do with my MIG are raised beads that look like half a green bean laid flat on the seam.

* Do you have any good videos or suggestions for improving my work?  

* There is a welding school nearby me, in Orlando, FL. I don't plan to get a job in my college degree's area of study, so is welding a fun and rewarding career? The tech degree is only 3-4k$ and 1100 hours.

* My father worked in a trailer factory welding so I've heard it's just grueling hot work in awful conditions, and you'll get nothing but burns for all your efforts. Is this an apt description?

* What is the daily life of a career welder?  

Any help or insights you guys can add would be appreciated, I'm having trouble taking that first plunge. I've done arc welding, brazing, and MIG but it's totally self taught so I have no idea of terms or methods or really.. anything. I just do what seems right and what I can find on google. But I'd rather hear directly from you guys, because the work you post here is absolutely awesome.

Anyways: 
The piece i'm welding (exterior corner of a fillet weld/t-shape) is very thick and the welds are coming out very convex. It's pretty much a cylinder cut in half and put on. Is this what I want? I thought I wanted it to be more concave and inward. Since the metal is so thick, should i go with a 240v welder? I don't have access to one though. Thanks everyone.

I started out with the SMAW process using a standard green (shade 10) lens. It was a little dark for me (I couldn't see as much as I would have liked), but I also would experience a little ""flare"" after lifting my hood up (I should mention my eyes are somewhat sensitive). The arc/flame was reddish orange and it was difficult for me to see anything besides the puddle and actual arc. I used this lens for the entire time we used the SMAW process. After learning the basics of SMAW we moved on to GMAW and my instructor commented some of us might need to go a shade darker. I asked my assistant instructor for a shade 12 because my sensitivity. He didn't have any shade 12 lenses, but he did have a new Omni View Gold shade 11. I installed it and went to work. The difference was AMAZING! The arc was a blue color, I could see my entire work piece, and I didn't experience any ""flare"" after raising my hood. I even went back to a standard green just in case the MIG arc color itself was different from the stick arc, it wasn't. I tried a buddy's Miller Elite (auto) while he tried the gold lens and he agreed visibility was greatly improved. 

So, in conclusion, would I recommend a gold passive lens? ABSOLUTELY! My weld quality improved (you can't weld what you can't see) and the post welding ""flare"" was reduced to an undetectable level. If you run a passive hood, I would definitely recommend at the very least trying one, I don't see (pun intended) how you wouldn't like them.",,False,self,t5_2serw,False,,,True,t3_1k49cu,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1k49cu/gold_vs_standard_passive_lenses_from_a_welding/,
1375855500.0,7,self.Welding,1jv8du,I lucked into a free MIG welder...please help a beginner get started!,veryoffensivename,8,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1jv8du/i_lucked_into_a_free_mig_welderplease_help_a/,"Learning to weld has been #1 on my ""things to do in the future"" list for awhile, but I just haven't had the money to spare for equipment.  I told an aquaintance yesterday that I was thinking of trading some of my woodworking tools (a thickness planer and a jointer) for a basic welder hoping for advice on what to look for on Craigslist, and I wound up with an extra someone gave to him that he has no use for (a Solar 2-175...Google tells me that it's not the greatest, but it was free, and now it's mine!).  All I need is a bottle and a helmet and to wire up a 220v outlet and I can get started.  Suddenly learning to weld has moved from something to do ""some day"" to something I'm starting now.

I'm hoping the fine folks of Weldit can point me to some resources I can use to learn on my own.  I'm a very competant DIYer...I've taught myself tiling, plumbing, wiring and a whole host of others while renovating a house, and I do all of my own maintenance and repairs on my cars and bicycles using manuals and the Internet.  Pretty much everything that I can possibly do myself I do because...well...I'd rather do it myself.

My ultimate goal is to build bicycle frames (out of steel and aluminum), and as an intermediate step I want to fabricate certain parts (mostly from aluminum) like racks, cargo trailers, and an idea I have for a simple, inexpensive suspension fork.  I know that TIG welding is what I need to learn for frame-building, but a MIG welder is what I have, and whether or not it's the best starting point, it's where I'm starting from.  I'm also not an idiot and I know what I don't know...and what I don't know much about is welding.

I've learned the difference between MIG (the arc comes from the wire that is fed through the gun) vs. TIG (tungsten electrode creates the arc and a separate stick is used to fill the weld) from reading, and I'm getting a grasp of the limitations of MIG vs. TIG (lower temp at start, less control over temp, 'ugly' welds, etc.) for the applications I'm interested in.  I've also figured out that a thick skin is required for asking any welding questions on the Internet.  

I don't know anything about *how* to weld, so I guess that's mostly what I'm looking for.  I ran a couple of beads yesterday using a different welder, but I was wearing shorts and sandals (in my defense, I didn't wake up expecting to weld) and quickly decided that I'd be better off trying again later with proper clothing.  I was able to guess from looking at them (and from the breif intro I had) that I was too far away and moving too fast...but that's the extent of my experience.  I don't have anyone I can ask to show me anything or to look at any welds I do.  I know a community college course would be a great start, but the only option I have is far out in the suburbs during the day and I'm a stay-at-home-dad so it's not currently a possibility.  It's basically me and the internet for the forseable future.

In light of all of that, I'm hoping you all can help me get started, and I have a couple of questions that may or may not be relevant:

* Is there a 'Bible' for Mig welding?  A book, or a website that covers everything the beginner ought to know?  Failing that, is there a good resource for the basics that I can supplement by googling questions/issues/problems?
* What other resources are out there for the beginner?  Any suggestions for keywords I should search on Youtube, or any channels/uploaders that are good to follow?
* Are there any forums where I can ask stupid beginner questions and get useful answers?  Any tips on how to phrase questions or info to include to avoid getting torn apart (or ignored)?
* Are there common beginner mistakes to watch out for?  Are there 'bad habits' I should avoid falling into?
* What tips and tricks and pitfalls-to-avoid would you share with the beginner?
* Is there anything I should know about my particular welder?  I understand the 'spot' and 'continuous feed' settings, but WTF is the 'stitch' setting for?
* What general advice/suggestions/etc. can the veterans give me, especially in light of what I ultimately want to do?  Is there anything specific I should focus on, or is it better to just learn everything I can about MIG and my equipment before moving on?
* What should I be asking that I don't know enough to ask?

If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading!  I really appreciate every response (even the angry ones)!

Gusset!! – No matter how confident you are in how a situation looks or feels, have some kind of support, a fall-back plan perhaps. Even triple-weld passes can fail. 

2) Eye-Ball It – Sometimes you don’t have the proper resources to get something in life. If and when this happens, take a step-back, look at the situation, and use what you got. There’s been many case where I couldn’t use a speed-square on a fender because the sides can’t be trusted. 

3) Prepare for kickbacks: - Not everything goes as planned. Mentally or physically prepare yourself for failure in an idea or action. Don’t let yourself get into a situation where you are cornered, because fighting your way out can cause damage. 

4) Beware of Cross-Threading – An extension of #3; if something doesn’t feel right, don’t force it! You will end up damaging someone, or something. 

5) Punch In – Let people know you’re there. Don’t keep too many feelings or emotions locked up. Share your intentions with those you care about, because if you don’t punch in, you don’t get paid! 


6) Punch Out – This is an honour thing. When you’re done with something or someone, let it be known. Don’t take from people when you haven’t earned anything. 

7) Pack A Lunch – Always prepare for a long hard day, week, month, or year. I can’t remember how many times I’ve worked longer than I should have, without being properly fed or hydrated. 

8) Take 15 – Don’t overdue yourself, it will only cause undue stress. But beware; if you rest too long, you will lose any momentum and motivation you previously had. 

9) Beware Of Gloves – It’s okay to protect yourself…at the right times. Sheltering yourself from hurt may in fact cause more hurt. Like having an unnecessary glove getting caught in a drill-press, or worse, a saw. 

10) If It’s Falling, Let It Fall - A big rule learnt in trades school, and an extension of #4. If something is going to fall, let it fall, and pick up the pieces later. As stated before, don’t force anything to work if it’s clearly not going to work. 

11) All That Shines Turns To Rust - The last, and probably most unnerving reality of my list. Even the most promising, beautiful, “light-in-the-dark” things in life must rust, dull, or fade. Everything must come to an end. Relationships, jobs, and ultimately, life. Don’t hope for something to last forever, because it won’t. You can grease, oil, care for anything for as long as you want, put more blood, sweat, and tears into it than you’d care to admit, but eventually you will either give up on it or it will give up on you. You can kill rust all you want, restore it to what it once was. It is important to do this, don’t get me wrong.

I decided to fire it up and jump right in on steel since all of the advice I've gotten so far has led me to believe that would be the easiest place to start. 

I started with a red tungsten on freshly cleaned 1/8"" steel (used a new flap disc) and using ER70S rod. What a pain in the ass it was.. man I couldn't figure out how the hell to do anything right. Tons of splattering, puddle was barely visible and virtually impossible to control, and the filler rod just wouldn't stop melting before I even got near the puddle. I made such a mess that I just decided to walk away and try later. 

My version of ""try later"" ended up being a switch to aluminum. I figured it was going to go equally as badly since everyone says aluminum is harder to work with. I had a piece of 1/8"" plate that I bought from Lowe's so I cleaned it up and got right to it. WOW! What a difference!! The puddle was easy to control, easy to see since it was nice and shiny, and the filler rod just sucked itself into the puddle effortlessly. I even got cocky and tried my hand at the ""weave"" I see some of you doing (but it didn't turn out too nice). Obviously by the look of the welds I have a long way to go but I think it was a good start. What do you guys think? Any tips, pointers? Any input you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

So, I jumped at the opportunity to inherit a full sized bottle rig with a full victor torch set for free (as well as a Lincoln Tombstone arc welder). It had been sitting in a barn unused for years and was inherited from yet again some other dude. 

So... I don't know all the specifics about bottle-ownership and certification. I know there are issues, but I would have to refer back to documentation for reference if I needed to know specific things. 

I went to the local welding supply to fill my acetylene tank (Alamo Welding in Austin TX rocks, very helpful). The guy starts looking and turning, looking and turning, looking and turning, and I'm thinking ""here comes the bad news"". He says ""this is a really old bottle"". I asked if I was going to have to buy a new one. He said ""no, you just have to pay $35 to get this one re-certified"". I said ""no big deal, what has it been 10-15 years?"" He said ""the last time this bottle was certified was in 1951.""

I bought some flashback arrestors for the regulator end and check valves for the torch end.

I have done a ton of reading and youtube-watching re:safety and operation. I have used a cutting torch before, but only did the cutting. I did not set up the torch and gas flow. 

I have 3 problems that will have to be fixed before I put it to use. First, a small flame was leaking from the wide nut that connects tip to torch body. I blew it out and it went away. Is this just a matter of re-seating it? 

Next, when I hit the oxy it flamed more or less the way it was supposed to but then it popped and went out. What causes that and how do I fix?

Lastly, I noticed there was oxy leakage at the lower oxy needle valve or connection to the check valve (new hose, btw). It leaked with the old hose before the check valve was put on as well, so I'm thinking it's the needle valve, but could be the coupling. Does one replace an entire needle valve assembly or is there an O-ring or something?

I am currently learning stick welding. Doing pretty good with 6010. 4g today, then onto 7018. I'm planning on ending this spring semester with AWS certification for SMAW. Fall 2013 will be MIG/TIG. I am also learning Oxy-Acetylene right now.   

After chatting it up with instructors I have determined that its about 50/50 for people that go work for the man or go independent. I feel pretty strongly that I want my own rig. Prospects sound good. It seems like there is a lot of work out there for someone who goes after it.

My problem is I don't know anyone personally (yet) that does this or has done this. So if I am to get my own rig, this is new territory that I am exploring alone. 

I think I understand what type of equipment I would need. That's obvious for the most part.

I guess my questions are:

Is it too early to start working? 
Is the biggest challenge coming up with cash to buy gear?
What can I expect from doing this?
Trailer vs. flatbed/boxes vs. regular truck bed?
Miller vs. Lincoln?
Old used AC/DC tombstone with seperate power gen vs. going big with a combo machine?
Has anyone tried going solo and ended up not liking it?

There's only so much small talk and questions I can ask in the shop, so being able to ask on reddit and potentially get feedback from multiple people on the same questions is nice. 

Also, one instructor made working independent sound easy... Among his tips: ""Dont put your phone number on your truck, youll get too many calls"" ""Just go sit in the parking lot at Safeway, people will approach you""... etc....

I even mentioned to someone at my job, which is completely unrelated to welding that I was in school for welding, and she asked if I know how, or know someone who can weld wrought iron... again, work is out there...

Head is spinning and I am excited to get to work. Also, I reeealllly really like stick welding...

What kind of protection is available when your shop doesn't offer any type of forced-air hoods or respirators?

I've tried using the dust-mask type things for galv but they don't fit my face worth a damn and create their own set of problems.

We usually run dual shield outside, but with some of the jobs, all the smoke just ends up getting funnelled right up into your hood. Plus, we still end up doing a lot of it in the shop and all the galv work is inside.

Now we've got a big structural job coming in and I'd really like to know my options. Am I being overly cautious?

Good sides are that I'd have the option to live within an hour of the college (OSU) that offers weld engineering, and I can learn the actual welding skill in my downtime, as my father is a welding instructor.

They currently design and sell welding simulators.


I was just posting here to try and get some views and opinions about whether current welders of all different levels of serious (hobbyists, experienced welders, teachers and instructors) think this is a cool concept that you might be interested in, that you consider a constructive innovation that will improve welder training and that might garner more interest in young people to become welders by profession. Currently, 123certification's product allows you to ""virtually"" weld using 5 of the different processes including GMAW, SMAW, GTAW, FCAW and MCAW. Basically how it works is that you have a real weld torch attached to a machine with a screen, you put on a real welding mask that has 3D goggles built in, and you see yourself in a welding training room, and are able to practice welding with 9 different welding assemblies (more are being developed) including the T-joint, butt joint, lap joint in all positions.



Basically the concept of the simulator is to allow new welders to practice and learn in a safe and comfortable environment, and allow the college or program that is teaching them to conserve on materials and energy. So it is both a money saver and a tool that makes welding seem more accessible to young people. It is only getting better and more refined everyday, but it currently focuses on the basics and to teach the hand-eye coordination and manual dexterity required for all good welders. It is meant to build a strong foundation (and make the student feel comfortable) before proceeding to real and more complex welding. It also has built in a powerful instructor guidance tool that allows instructors to set up welds and create a learning program designed specifically for each student. It also gives extensive feedback on each aspect of a student's weld to show them where they need to improve.

I'm coming to these forums as a young person going into first year university, and I wouldn't be doing so if I didn't honestly think this is a very cool idea. I've been told that there is a large shortage of new welders worldwide, and I think this could be a way to garner new interest. I know that welding is a fundamental profession for human infrastructure and projects and robots will never be able to replace human welders, especially in cramped or on-the-fly locations like welding repairs on oil pipelines or underwater.

I'm 23 years old, working a dead end job as a baker (I hate it) I have no financial support for school or anything else, and I'm not cut out for a desk job. I love working with my hands but the night hours and monotonous nature of baking is really getting old for me. I've been doing it for 6 years and I'm barely paying the bills, and it's time to do something with my life.

Now that all of that BS is out of the way, I'm not quite sure where to get started. My local CC offers a welding technology program that actually seems very nice, and they have a deal going with Lincoln down in Ohio, and they provided 43 brand new workstations so it's pretty top of the line equipment to learn on. I don't know much about the instructors but it seems like a good program. It's Lansing Community College if anyone wants to check it out.

http://www.lcc.edu/manufacturing/welding/

As I said before, my funds are extremely limited so I'm going to be taking out loans and looking for grants and financial aid, I'm just not sure what program to go into. They offer an Associates in applied sciences for welding as well as a certificate of achievement. Will the certificate be enough for me to pass welding tests and get a decent job? Do potential welding employers really care about a piece of paper degree or do they just want to see skill? Is a 3-semester certificate program going to give me the skill I need? Or should I buckle down and do the 2-3 year Associates program? Keep in mind I will absolutely have to be working 40+ hrs a week to make this possible, and I'm already worn out as it is.

So anything helpful tips that you didn't pick up till later that you think would help me progress my skills, I'd really appreciate.",,False,self,t5_2serw,False,,,True,t3_1iifbt,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1iifbt/need_advice_im_brand_new_to_welding/,

I am super happy to see such a cool community centered around welding! Welding has been a big part of my family (father is a welder, grandfather ran an irrigation supply/welding fab shop) for as long as I can remember, and some of my favorite memories are bonding with my dad after shop class running beads in the backyard. I haven't welded in several years now, but am looking to get back into it. Looking forward to hearing from everyone!",,False,self,t5_2serw,False,,,True,t3_1hyfto,http://www.reddit.com/r/Welding/comments/1hyfto/newcomer_here_you_guys_all_look_awesome_looking/,

And I really enjoyed it.

I've had a hard time finding word to provide for my family, and recently got offered to go to a trade school to become a certified Pipe Welder for free by a family member. I just wanna know if this would be a good investment considering the State I live in.
