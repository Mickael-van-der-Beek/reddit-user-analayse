1315686094.0,148,self.commandline,kbeoe,You can make readline (and bash) much more user friendly by adding a few options to ~/.inputrc,metellius,178,30,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/kbeoe/you_can_make_readline_and_bash_much_more_user/,"I spent some time reading through the readline manpages, and was surprised to see how friendly and efficient the prompt can be. Here's my .inputrc with all my settings and explanations, in decreasing order of usefulness (yes, I do realize this is highly subjective):

**set completion-ignore-case on**

This one is pretty obvious from the name; when completing case will not be taken into consideration.

Example:

    $ ls
    longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-4  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-7  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-11  VeryCompliCATEDfileNAME.txt
    longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-6  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-8  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-9
    $ ls very&lt;TAB&gt;
    $ ls VeryCompliCATEDfileNAME.txt



**set completion-prefix-display-length 2**

This one is insanely useful when you have a folder with lots of similarly named files and you are not sure how far the completion has gone when you press TAB. The first part that has been completed will be replaced by ""..."", and it is simple to see what you need to type to finish the completion.

Example:

    $ ls
    longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-4  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-7  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-11  VeryCompliCATEDfileNAME.txt
    longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-6  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.37-8  longFileNameLINUX-2.6.38-9
    $ ls long&lt;TAB&gt;
    ...7-4   ...7-6   ...7-7   ...7-8   ...8-11  ...8-9
    $ ls longFileNameLINUX-2.6.3


** Control-j: menu-complete**

** Control-k: menu-complete-backward**

These two will make Ctrl-j and Ctrl-k to cycle through the available completions. This is useful when you get a small number of possible completions (say 2-4), and you know it would be faster to simply cycle through them with a few keypresses, than to actually type it out.

Example:

    $ ls
    cfg-common.h  cfg-mencoder.h  cfg-mplayer-def.h  cfg-mplayer.h
    $ ls cfg&lt;TAB&gt;
    ...common.h       ...mencoder.h     ...mplayer-def.h  ...mplayer.h
    $ ls cfg-&lt;Press ctrl-j three times&gt;
    $ ls cfg-mplayer-def.h


(As a bonus, in this particular example where there happened to be only four files in the directory, I could've actually just done this instead:)

    $ ls &lt;Press ctrl-j three times&gt;
    $ ls cfg-mplayer-def.h


**set show-all-if-ambiguous on**

**set show-all-if-unmodified on**

These will make completions appear immediately after pressing TAB once, instead of the default behavior which is to show them after pressing twice. I think you'll find this saves you many unnecessary keystrokes, but the potential downside is that it could take up the space of terminal backlog you were intending on keeping visible.


**set completion-map-case on**

With this enabled, underscores and hyphens are treated equally when completing, which is a plus to me because I find hyphens a lot easier to type. 

So, that's all of them. Let me know in the comments if you have any other ones!

* `dirname`: This is the counterpart of `basename`.  Give `dirname` a path, and it will return the non-filename component of it:

        $ dirname /var/tmp/foo 
        /var/tmp

* `du`: Disk usage.  This utility will describe how much space a file or tree of directories uses on disk.  Note that this is different from the size that `ls -l` will return.  `ls` will report the logical size of the file: if a file appears to contain one megabyte of data, it will return one megabyte.  However, if that one megabyte can be stored more- (or less-) efficiently than by using one megabyte on disk, du will return that size.  Using [sparse files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file) is the most-common cause of this effect.  Because du returns sizes in blocks, which is typically a rather large and hard-to-read number, it's common to use the syntax `du -h`, which prints sizes in a human-readable form.  I also commonly use -m for ""size in megabytes"" and then numerically-sort the output; this provides a good summary of the things that consume the largest amount of space in a directory tree:

        du -m /var|sort -n

* `env`: Run in a given environment (as in, environment variables).  This program has a couple of common uses.  First, it's possible to remove all existing environment variables from a given environment with -i and then specify a list of only the variables desired.  This can be helpful to ensure that the surrounding environment is not affecting a program:

        $ env -i PATH=/bin:/usr/bin ls

    Second, because env is at a fixed location and searches PATH for the program that it is executing and many interpreters are not always at a fixed location, but the kernel requires that an interpreter after a shebang be at a fixed location, env is sometimes used after the shebang in scripts to run a program, no matter where it is, as long as it is in PATH.

    If the following shows up as the first line of a perl script, it won't matter where on the drive the `perl` executable lives:

        #!/usr/bin/env perl

* `expand`: If a file is using tabs rather than spaces for indentation, this will convert the tabs to spaces.

* `expr`: This permits computing a mathematical expression.  For example:

        $ a=$(expr 2 ""*"" 6)
        $ echo $a
        12

    This program is very easy to misuse, since your shell will, by default, expand things like asterisks; they must be quoted.  Arithmetic expansion is similar (though not identical) to `expr`, and I normally use it instead, since it avoids the quoting issues and is more concise:

        $ a=$((2 * 6))
        $ echo $a
        12

* `factor`: Compute the [prime factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factorization) of a number:

        $ factor 12
        12: 2 2 3

* `fmt` and `fold`: hard-wrap text to fit a particular width terminal.

* `groups`: Show the groups that a Unix user belongs to.  I tend to just refer to /etc/group:

        $ groups wadcann root
        wadcann : wadcann cdrom floppy sudo audio dip video plugdev fuse kvm
        root : root

* `head`: Prints the first N lines or bytes of a file.  This and its counter part `tail` (which prints the last N lines or bytes of a file) are quite useful.  I used them to dump the current list of coreutils programs that I am reciting here, to get lines 40-60:

        $ dpkg -L coreutils|grep bin|sort|head -n60|tail -n20

* `hostid`: I've never needed to use this for anything practical.  It prints a numeric GUID for the given host, but it's quite short, and (I believe) just a hash of the hostname, which makes collisions much more likely than (for example) Microsoft's large GUIDs.

* `id`: Show the userid (uid) and the effective userid (euid).  When you run something as root via ""sudo"", this changes the euid, but not the uid.  Not something that I make much use of.

* `install`: Performs a copy and sets ownership and permissions on the destination file all in one command; otherwise, it would be necessary to first `cp` and then `chgrp`, `chmod`, and `chown` the file.  Historically, I've most-commonly seen this used in Makefiles for the `make install` command.

* `join`: Perform a ""join"", something like an SQL join, on two sorted text files.  I use this program only occasionally, but it's very handy for scripts when it is needed.  Here's an example.  I've two text files, the first called useros.txt:

        Bob Linux
        Jane Windows

    And another textfile, license_cost.txt:

        Windows $97.49
        Linux $0
        Mac $19.99

    Then the following command finds lines with ""matching columns"":

        $ join -1 2 &lt;(sort useros.txt) &lt;(sort license_cost.txt)
        Linux Bob $0
        Windows Jane $97.49

* `link`: Creates hardlinks.  I always use `ln` for this rather than `link`.

* `logname`: Prints the username of the user logged in on the current terminal.  More reliable than, say, looking at `$USER`.

* `md5sum`: Computes a hash of a file, a short number that uniquely represents its contents.  Useful for comparing the contents of two files.  MD5 is no longer considered secure as a cryptographic hash, but it is easily large enough to avoid accidental collisions and is the hash I am most likely to use by default.

* `mkfifo`: Creates a FIFO, probably more-commonly-known as a named pipe.  This is a special file on the filesystem that acts as a small, in-memory buffer; anything that is written into the named pipe may be read by another program.  This can be convenient in shell scripts where a particularly complicated set of pipes need to be set up between processes, or for daemons that are expected to just listen for data, waiting to read from a file, and process it when data is written to it.

* `nice`: Makes processes ""nicer"", or being more-willing to let other processes have the CPU in their stead.  Good for non-interactive programs that will be running in the background and trying to use a significant amount of CPU time, like a rendering.  Lower nice numbers get more CPU time (that is, lower numbers are higher priority).

* `rm`: Removes a file or directory.  The most useful bits of rm that I probably make use of: -r removes an entire directory tree.  -f asks rm to succeed whether-or-not the thing could actually be removed, and won't stop and prompt for things that you don't have write permissions to

* `rmdir`: Removes a directory, which must be empty.  A safer alternative to the common `rm -rf` in scripts for any place that a directory being removed *should* be empty.

* `sleep`: Wait for the specified number of seconds, then return.  Good for adding pauses into scripts.

* `stty`: I believe this stands for ""set tty"".  It's used to set settings on a terminal.  While this provides very fine-grained control over a terminal, I don't usually make use of it in day-to-day use.  The most common operations I use here are:

        stty erase \^?

    or

        stty erase ^H

    To set the erase character to either ""backspace"" or ""delete""; historically, the lack of agreement as to what exactly should be sent on various systems meant that sometimes, backspace ""wouldn't work"" on a system.

        stty sane

    is also somewhat common; this resets a terminal to fairly reasonable values.  If a terminal is printing ""stair steps"", or something else is wacky, this will bring it back to a fairly comfortable state.  I used to use `stty sane` a lot; now I prefer the slightly-more-comprehensive `reset` to bring a terminal back to a reasonable state.

* `sync`: Syncs the buffer cache and the disk.  Normally, to speed disk operations up, programs that write to the disk won't actually send their data to the disk, but instead to the kernel's buffer cache in RAM.  The kernel normally performs a sync before killing the power when rebooting the system, so manually executing this is rarely a concern.  If for some reason you cannot cleanly shut down a system (I have had this happen), `sync` will push as much data as possible to the disk.

* `touch`: Time Of User CHange.  `touch foo` will change the modification time of file ""foo"" to be now, as if you had written to it.  This can be useful for some utilities that look at a file's modification time to see whether-or-not to look at it, like `make`.  The other common use of touch is to create an empty file: if a file does not yet exist, touch will create it.

* `true`: Returns with an exit code 0, or ""successfully"".  If wanting to test to see what happens when a program returns successfully, running ""true"" instead of that program can be handy.

* `uname`: ""Unix name"".  Prints a lot more information than just the name, however.  I often use `uname -a`, to print all available information about a machine.  The most frequent thing I use this for is to find what architecture OS a particular system is running; i386 and x86_64 are 32-bit and 64-bit x86 chips, respectively.

* `vdir`: Like `dir` and `ls`, but with slightly different defaults

* `[`: This is a bit of an odd name for a program, but for historical reasons, that's what it is.  When you run a shell expression like:

        a=bleh
        if [ -n $a ]; then
            echo a has been set
        fi

    The ""["" bit was once a program and if your shell has ""["" built in to it to avoid wasting time launching an extra program each time, it will still act like a separate program.

    Typically, when writing scripts, it's a better idea to use ""[["" and ""]]"" instead of ""["" and ""]"".  Because ""["" acts like a separate program, it doesn't know how you quote things in your shell.  If variable values have spaces, it's unaware of the fact:

        a=bleh blah
        if [ -n $a ]; then
            echo a has been set
        fi

    This will fail, because ""$a"" will expand to ""bleh blah"" (without the quotes), and bash expects only *one* string to follow ""-n"".  Use [[ -n $a ]] instead, however, and things will work, because [[ is guaranteed to be part of your shell and knows that everything that ""$a"" expands to will be a single value.

* `arch`: Prints the architecture of the machine.  I rarely use this, since `uname` can do the same thing.

* `base64`: [Base-64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encodes a value as a particular type of ASCII string:

        $ echo foo|base64
        Zm9vCg==

    It can be decoded with `base64 -d`.

    This is used when you can not store arbitrary binary data, somewhere.  For example, suppose I have small bit of binary data that I want to store in an environment variable.  Environment variables cannot contain a ""0"" byte, but they can contain Base64-encoded ASCII of any data, including a ""0"" byte.

* `basename`: This prints the ""filename"" portion of a path.  For example:

        $ basename /tmp/foo
        foo

* `chcon`: Used by SELinux (a rather-elaborate Linux security framework for running processes with a restricted set of permissions) to affect how processes can access a file.  I don't use SELinux, and I suspect that few people will likely to make use of this.

* `cksum`: Checksum.  A [checksum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum) is a small value that changes if the input changes.  This is useful for creating two small values that can then be later compared to see if the contents of a file have changed, or to see if two files are different:

        $ echo ""bar"" &gt;foo
        $ cksum foo
        3848730072 4 foo

    Any file containing ""bar"" and exactly ""bar"" will produce the same checksum.  cksum doesn't see much use these days, as it uses a simple and small checksum that is fast-to-compute but has tended to be supplanted by the larger, less-likely-to-wind-up-with-two-different-files-producing-the-same-checksum MD-5 for even non-cryptographic use (where it doesn't matter whether someone can *intentionally* produce a different file that has the same checksum), and the slower SHA256 where cryptographic use is required.

* `comm`: Compare two files.  If you've two files with lines, `comm` can print out the lines that show up in only one or the other.  Handy if you have a list of, say, ten thousand files that used to be in a directory, and want to see if the new directory listing has any new files, and if so what they are.

* `csplit`: context split.  This can split a file up based on regular expressions.  Let's say that you have a file named foo.txt that looks like this INI, a common older configuration file format on Windows:

        [global]
        first_setting=1
        second_setting=2
        [master]
        override=1
        [slave]
        third_setting=3
        fourth_setting=4

    Then running the command `csplit -f foo-part. foo.txt ""/\^\[.*\]/"" ""{*}""`

    Will create three files, foo-part.01, foo-part.02, and foo-part.03, each containing the contents of one of the above sections.

* `cut`:  This is a utility that I use an awful lot -- it lets one take a particular ""field"" from a line of text.  For example, if you have a file foo.txt containing:

        John $5
        Mary $3
        Ted $4

    Then the command

        grep ^Mary foo.txt|cut -d"" "" -f 2

    Will print ""$3"".

    I find this particularly helpful in conjunction with `tr -s "" ""`.  Many programs print an arbitrary number of spaces around their columns.  For example, the command `w` might print:

        wadcann  pts/6    :pts/5:S.0       23:56    3.00s  0.00s  0.00s emacsclient -a
        wadcann  pts/7    :pts/2:S.1       23:58   24:36   0.04s  0.00s pager -s

    There are a lot of spaces in there.  But passing this data through `tr -s "" ""` squeezes runs of spaces down to one space:

        wadcann pts/6 :pts/5:S.0 23:56 5.00s 0.00s 0.00s emacsclient -a
        wadcann pts/7 :pts/2:S.1 23:58 25:52 0.04s 0.00s pager -s

    I can then pass that to `cut -d"" "" -f 3` and grab the third field.

* `dircolors`: Directory colors.  This program is used by `ls --color=yes`.  It prints out the environment variables that, if set, determine what colors ls should use with what filetypes.

    If you want to attach your own colors to a particular file type, create a ~/.dircolors file by running `dircolors -p &gt;~/.dircolors`.  Then edit or add filetypes and colors.  When you're done, running `eval $(dircolors ~/.dircolors)` will start your shell using them; I keep `eval $(dircolors ~/.dircolors)` in my ~/.zshrc.

My favourite trick that I've found is:

    function gcode() { grep --color=always -rnC3 -- ""$@"" . | less -R; }

Stick that in ~/.bash_aliases and you can have a find-in-files feature anywhere!

Some other useful ones are:

    function down() { popd &gt; /dev/null; }

Emacs has [SES](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SimpleEmacsSpreadsheet).  This is nice if you're a heavy emacs user and like lisp, as all the formula entry is in elisp, but it's not necessarily the most-approachable thing for an Excel user.  Using `(*100 (- (expt (/ A1 A2)) 1)` is great if you're familiar with the elisp library, but not quite the `=(A1/A2)^.1-1*100` that some may have been expecting.

There's a program called [sc](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10699), which is an ncurses-based spreadsheet.  It supports basic emacs navigation, though it's clearly more intuitive to a vi user, as it follows the vi way of doing things.  It has a very basic function library.

GNU oleo, which I recall last trying years ago and not being terribly impressive, seems to have dropped out of the Debian repositories these days.

There's a package called [teapot](http://www.syntax-k.de/projekte/teapot/) which, oddly-enough, isn't in the Debian repositories either.  This has both a graphical and an ncurses interface.  The reference syntax is a bit verbose (instead of using `=A1/A2`, one might use `@(x()-1,y()-1)/@(x()-1,y())`).  I was surprised to find it doing integer arithmetic by default (that is, 3/4 = 0, whereas 3.0/4.0 = .75).  The function library is also fairly small.

Surprisingly enough (I'd thought that the terminal would be a great place to find spreadsheet applications), that pretty much wraps things up.  There are no shortage of powerful mathematical programs for the console ([maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/), a Mathematica-alike, and [octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/), a MATLAB-alike, being two notables).

1362124099.0,47,self.commandline,19garq,"A sampling of coreutils, 1-20",wadcann,58,11,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/19garq/a_sampling_of_coreutils_120/,"It took me a long time to actually learn some of the less-common commands on Linux systems back in the day.  The particular package that contains most of the really crucial commands is called coreutils on Debian-based and Red Hat-based and most other Linux distributions.  Let's go for a quick skim through some of the commands in it.  I'll do the first twenty, and add my particular comments on each command.  First, I run `dpkg -L coreutils|grep bin`, which on a Debian system, will list the programs in a particular package.  Then I'll grab just the first twenty of these:

`dpkg -L coreutils|grep bin|sort|head -n20`:

* `cat`: concatenates files, appending their contents in order.  If I run `cat file1 file2 file3`, cat will first send file1 to stdout, then file2, then file3.  Cat is actually most commonly used not to concatenate files, but to output the contents of a single file, since if only one file is listed, its behavior will be to show the contents of just that file.

* `chgrp`: Changes the group owning a file.  On a Linux system, each file has a user who owns it, and a group that owns it:

        $ ls -l /tmp/foo
        drwxrwxrwx 21 root root 16384 Feb 28 23:05 /tmp/foo

    The first ""root"" means that the owning user is ""root"", and the second ""root"" that the owning group is ""root"".  Running `chgrp blah /tmp/foo` would change the owning group to ""blah"".

* `chmod`: Changes the permissions on a file.  You can see above how /tmp/foo had three clumps of ""rwx"".  That's (Read, Write, and eXecute) permissions for the user that owns the file, for the group that owns the file, and for other (everyone else).  There are two syntaxes often used; one of these is convenient for changing the existing permissions slightly, and the other for setting all the permissions at once.  `chmod o+rw` will add read and write permissions to ""other"".  `chmod 755` treats 755 as an octal (base-8) number.  This is convenient, because an octal digit has three ones or zeroes in it when written in binary -- 7 is 111, and 5 is 101.  If you take each of the 1s and 0s from writing out the digits in order, you get the full set of rwx permissions.  755 is 111101101, which is rwxr-xr-x.

* `chown`: Change owner.  This works the same way that chgrp does, but with a user instead of a group.

* `cp`: copy files or directories.  One useful option is cp -a, which retains the original modification times and other metadata on the original files; good if you want an exact copy of a whole directory tree.

* `date`: This prints out the current date and time.  This is a handy way to see the current time, or to get a timestamp.

* `dd`: I don't actually know what ""dd"" stands for; probably something like ""data duplicator"".  `dd` moves data from one place to another.  Unlike most Unix utilities, its ""options"" do not start with a dash.  It's often used to copy a fixed amount of data from one place to another.  One use would be creating a file of exactly five megabytes of zeroes: `dd if=/dev/zero of=foo bs=1M count=5` would push five one-megabyte blocks of zeroes from /dev/zero to the file ""foo"".

* `df`: Shows disk free space on mounted filesystems.  I most commonly use this like so: `df -h`, which prints the sizes in a much-more-comfortable-for-a-human-to-read format.

* `dir`: The same thing as ""ls"": a tool for listing files.

* `echo`: This command simply sends to its stdout whatever arguments were given it on the command line:

        $ echo foo
        foo
        $

    It's probably most-commonly used for pushing small amounts of data into another program's standard input.   There are two useful arguments that I make use of -- -n will tell `echo` not to print a newline at the end of what it echoed, and -e will tell `echo` to interpret some character sequences specially, like converting ""\t"" into a tab character, and ""\n"" into a newline character.

* `false`: This program simply exits with a non-zero exit code, ""failing"".  I usually use it when I want to test what happens when a particular program fails...I just run ""false"" instead of that program.

* `ln`: This program creates hardlinks and symlinks.  I rarely see hardlinks used.  `ln -s foo bar` will create a symlink called ""bar"" that points at ""foo""; when attempting to access ""bar"", programs will actually access ""foo"".

* `ls`: This program lists files.  The options I make most use of are -a, which also prints files that have a leading ""."" in their name (the Unix convention for hiding a file), and -l, which lists permissions and other metadata associated with the file.

* `mkdir`: This program makes a directory.  The option that I make most use of is -p, which creates all directories in a path: mkdir -p /foo/bar/baz will create all three directories, even if none of them already existed.  In addition, -p will cause the command not to fail if the directory already exists.

* `mknod`: Make a special file node, or device file.  This command doesn't see much use any more.  These days, device files in /dev/ are typically automatically-created by the operating system when a device is detected or plugged in.  At one point, these files had to be automatically-created, and mknod was the way to do this.

* `mktemp`: Make a temporary file or directory.  Sometimes you're running a script and you want to store some data temporarily somewhere.  Well, you *could* just make up a name, like ""/tmp/foo""...but then if two copies of your program were running at the same time, the files would crash into each other.  mktemp will create the file and print its name.  A typical usage might be:

        tempfile=$(mktemp)
        wget http://www.google.com/index.html -O ""$tempfile""
        lines=$(wc -l ""$tempfile"")
        echo ""Google's homepage currently has $lines lines""
        rm ""$tempfile""

* `mv`: move.  This utility moves or renames files.

* `pwd`: Prints the working directory.  Each process on a Unix system has a ""current working directory"" associated with it; the most obvious example is bash.  Running `pwd` will show the entire path to a working directory.

* `readlink`: Normally, this reads the target of a symlink and prints it.  However, I rarely use it for this.  What it is useful for is as the standard way to ""canonicalize"" a filename with the -f flag.  That means that it follows all symlinks in the path and makes the path absolute, rather than relative.

So I did the only thing a sane person would do with this new found information, I wrote a shell one liner that displays images in glorious TrueColor, enjoy!

`function img { for image in ""$@""; do convert -thumbnail $(tput cols) ""$image"" txt:- | awk -F '[)(,]' '!/^#/{gsub(/ /,"""");printf""\033[48;2;""$3"";""$4"";""$5""m ""}'; echo -e ""\e[0;0m""; done ;}`

Then just type `img picture.png`, it uses imagemagick so will load anything that supports (png, jpeg, bmp, gif, tiff, svg, etc) and even  partial animated gif support ;P.

But the Unix command line has a peculiar tendency to develop puns; someone working on a project comes up with a name that makes them laugh for a moment, so they adopt it.  But sometimes, this is really tough on the millions of end users, who may wind up using the program for many years.  In some cases, in-jokes that made sense at the time the software was introduced and to the few users of that software become downright forehead-wrinkling years later to a broader array of users.  A few examples:

* [`tac`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tac_%28Unix%29).  [`cat`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_%28Unix%29) is a traditional Unix program that catenates files; that is, it appends one to the other.  `tac`, is, of course, ""cat"" backwards.  It takes standard input and prints out the lines it is given in reverse order.  But understanding that requires grasping an in-joke that depends on Unix history (and it's not as if `tac` even converts ""cat"" to ""tac"", as it only reverses the order of lines; the more-reasonably-named `rev` reverses the order of characters).

* [`toe`](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=toe&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=Debian+testing+wheezy&amp;format=html&amp;locale=en).  Unix has a system called [terminfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminfo) that contains information about various terminals; it maps $TERM to a set of features that that terminal has.  To speed access to this database and reduce its size, a binary-only format was used.  This conflicted with the long Unix tradition of being friendly to text-editors and permitting modifying files directly, so the binary format was compiled from a text format.  The program to do this was called [`tic`](http://manpages.debian.net/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tic&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=Debian+testing+wheezy&amp;format=html&amp;locale=en) for ""**t**erm**i**nfo **c**ompiler"".  Another name was required for the program that could display the contents of these binary files.  Of course, one could pun off the game of [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe), but ""tac"" had already been taken to complete the *above* pun, so ""toe"" was the only option remaining to complete the pun.  I doubt that the typical user is going to make much sense out of this name, given the amount of history required to understand the in-joke.

* [`lynx`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_%28web_browser%29) and friends.  This is one of the worst of offenders, IMHO.  Hypertext links are often called ""links"" for short.  Some developers thought that it would be funny to call a web browser ""lynx"", which can't be distinguished from ""links"" when spoken.  Another developer thought that it would be even better to continue the joke and this time make the *spelling* indistinguishable as well with [`links`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_%28web_browser%29).  That browser saw a number of spinoffs, like [`elinks`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELinks), `links2`, and another unfortunate addition to the can't-be-verbally-distinguished crowd, [`linkx`](http://linkx.sourceforge.net/).

* [`pine`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_%28e-mail_client%29) and friends.  Originally, there was a mail program called [`elm`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm_%28e-mail_client%29), short for ""**el**ectronic **m**ail"".  Then, as an in-joke, the `pine` program was produced.  After that, the floodgates were opened for [`alpine`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_%28email_client%29), [`balsa`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balsa_%28e-mail_client%29), [`spruce`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/spruce/), and [`mahogany`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahogany_%28email_client%29).  This one isn't nearly as bad in my book; users normally keep using an email client for quite a bit, so it's not as hard to remember the name of the program.  But it sure seems like it would have been possible to get names that were a lot more evocative of email...

* [`nano`](http://www.nano-editor.org/).  Speaking of pine, pine's editor was called [`pico`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_%28text_editor%29), for **pi**ne **co**mposer.  When it was replaced, its replacement was a pun on ""pico"" -- ""nano"".  Years after pico is dead, ""nano"" isn't a terribly obvious name for an easy-to-use text-based editor; the users who *most* might want to find and use `nano` are the ones to whom the name is probably not very obvious.

* [`clit`](http://www.convertlit.com/download.php).  Point driven further home by the source tree, with `cuntlits.c` and friends.  On the up side, this *is* a direct acronym from ""Convert LIT"", and it doesn't involve any esoteric in-jokes.  The Debian packagers avoided some controversy by renaming the package (but not binary) to ""convlit"".

And while I think that the command-line gets the worst of this, there are any number of Unixy names that are just awful.  ""Slashdot"" was chosen specifically to be difficult-to-prounounce: ""Ache Tee Tee Pee Colon Slash Slash Slashdot dot org"".  ""[GIMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIMP)"" is still awkward for artists who would like to use the tool without the [BDSM association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondage_suit).  [Pan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_%28newsreader%29), the GNOME newsreader, was retronymed to mean nothing after having ""Pimp-Ass Newsreader"" being the GNOME newsreader became a bit embarrassing.

That's not to say ""don't have fun with the program"", but rather to suggest keeping in mind how much of a headache the name may be if the program becomes popular.  Often the name of a software package seems to be taken as an offhand joke and forgotten about, even while far more care lavished on internals that most users will never wind up seeing or appreciating.  Names are more than just a quick laugh!

I looked around Google (just a quick check) and while there are some Linux mags with CLI issues and a few roundups of CLI apps, there were no magazines *on* the CLI and there was nothing really regular that allowed me to discover new CLI apps.

So later on, I was just chilling again and since I had nothing to do, I thought, ""why not make a Pages template?"" It just looked like fun! I started thinking of a template to make and the thought came to my head that I could make the magazine I wanted from earlier.

I made a mockup. It's not finished, and it just includes a cover page and a blank page. The whole template is just those pages. I exported to PDF and I wanted you guys to check it out, just to see what you think.

Is there any interest for a magazine like this in this subreddit? Regular roundups and reviews of CLI apps and tips and tricks for the command line? A magazine/webzine that you could subscribe to?

I know I would subscribe to a magazine like this, but unfortunately I have too many commitments at this point, so I can't work on this. If anyone wants to take the lead, I could save as Pages, or export to Word if you're on a PC.

Then you may use multithreading.

Basically:
    xargs -P4 -i command 

What this does is that it will spawn up to 4 processes/threads of the command you used to do single threaded.

Now, this won've prove to be usefull at all, you need to mass-feed xarg with the values that the command will need to work, I will give you an example I'm using at this very moment, download images from tumblr.

    cat links_file.txt | xargs -n1 -P20 -t -i wget -rH -Dmedia.tumblr.com,'{}' -R ""*avatar*"" -A ""[0-9]"" \

    -A ""*index*"" -A jpeg,jpg,bmp,gif,png --level=10 -nd -nc \

    http://'{}' \

*This is how it works step by step*

Before starting, I used a link generator to generate all the links that have to be mass feeded to wget, I did this by using this script:

    for page in `seq ${PAGE1} 1 ${PAGE2}`;
    do
    echo ""${ADDR}.tumblr.com/page/${page}"" &gt;&gt; ${LINKS_FILE}
    done

Get it? I asked the address that coms before .tumblr.com (ADDR), the starting page (PAGE1), the ending page (PAGE2), and the LINKS_FILE points to a document text on the same location where the script is.


After we have our links on a format of (NOTE THE MISSING HTTP AT THE BEGGINING):

    site.tumblr.com/page/1

    site.tumblr.com/page/2

    /site.tumblr.com/page/3

    etc

Then it is just a matter of mass sending it to xarg and spawn as many wget threads as you can.

1. We cat the links file to obtain the first line, a full url link

2. We send that to xargs who will spawn a wget command that will recursively download (r) the site and span hosts (-H)

3. -Dmedia.tumblr.com,${ADDR}.tumblr.com tells wget to only visit domains that are part of media.tumblr.com and ${ADDR}.tumblr.com, -R ""*avatar*"". This tells wget to download any files with avatar in them.

4. -A ""[0-9]"" -A ""*index*"" -A jpeg,jpg,bmp,gif,png. -A is the counterpart to -R. This tells wget to allow files that contains jpeg, jpg, bmp, gif, or png and to allow any files that contain index and to allow files that contain 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Why the list? We need the index page to keep spidering, we need the number to download pages from the archive, and we need the file formats to download those image types.

5. --level=10 tells wget to go 10 levels deep. This would be dangerous except that we’ve restricted domains and limited the file names that can be downloaded

6. -nd tells wget not to recreate the directory structure and to instead download all of the files into the current working directory.

7. -nc tells gets not to re-download files that exist. This is to keep tumblr happy with us and prevent files from being needlessly redownloaded.

8. Finally at the end it will replace '{}' for what it read from the links file.

At the end it will spawn up to 40 threads (-P40) each one of them with one link of the file, thus not spawning repeated threads.

This is written by me with some parts and explanations obtained from somewhere I do not remember.

I'm not a big fan of having all of my personal stuff on Google Calendar so I had to find another way to keep myself up-to-date and started using pcal. I'm also a big fan of having paper calendars... and pcal can do that too!

You can fins more about pcal on the [project's sourceforge page](http://pcal.sourceforge.net/) but since the documentation is huge, let me give you a few examples. I'm not claiming to be an expert, I've only been using it for a few months to do really specific tasks but this might be useful to some people.

The easiest thing is to print a year-long, blank calendar. Every month takes up 1 page (which you could change when printing, by specifying you want let's say, 4 pages per sheet) I use this as my planner for school. I like having the whole month on a single page... it gives me enough room each day without being too big.

&gt;pcal -b all -S 2012 | ps2pdf - 2012.pdf

pcal outputs the calendar(s) in PostScript so we pipe it to ps2pdf in order to get a pdf as a result. I print from school so it's better for me to have a pdf than a postscript file anyways. If you find the font to be a bit too big you can change it:

&gt;pcal -b all -S -d /12 -t /24 | ps2pdf - 2012.pdf

The -t switch changes the header (month) while the -d changes the size of the date (in each square) leaving more room for you to add stuff.

The really need thing about pcal is that you can 'feed' it some events to be automatically added to your calendars. A file containing events might look something like this:

&gt;25/01/2011 Assignment 1 due today

&gt;26/01/2011 Day off!

&gt;27/01/2011 Exam 1

&gt;27/01/2011 Dentist appointment

The cool thing with pcal is that it supports a pretty wide range of formats for events. For example, it would understand ""every monday on january"". Once you have your file you can specify it by using the -f parameter.",,False,self,t5_2s4oq,False,,,True,t3_ox1yy,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/ox1yy/you_can_use_pcal_to_quickly_generate_calendars/,

Never having to worry about GUI things like which widget has focus is simpler, and I find it easier to focus. I've got certain things switched over, but still have a few gaps. 

I was hoping to start a discussion about 'living' on the command line. I'll share what I'm doing (and what I'm missing) and look forward to hearing from others.

What I've got:

* `mutt` for email. Took a few days to adjust, and I still need to tweak things now and then as I learn more.
* `devtodo` for todo list. I don't like how all items are in a single xml document, but I do like how it saves &amp; timestamps completed items.
* `tilda` for my always-available terminal. I'm still using X.
* `screen` for switching between my tasks. Haven't looked at `tmux` yet.
* `git` &amp; cron to version &amp; back-up important parts of $HOME.
* A few custom scripts, including a wrapper around devtodo to remind me what I'm working on right now (to remind me to focus on one task at a time).

What I'm missing:

* A logger. I'm still using `tomboy` and the 'note of the day' plugin to keep a journal or log.
* A notebook. I'm still using `tomboy` to keep track of scraps of information, whether temporary (Shipments to track) or permanent (Notes on how to secure-erase my ssd).
* RSS reader. I'm using google reader, but am drawn to `rss2email` and a filter rule and use that with mutt.

It originally allowed you to define a cheat sheet in a file that you could then retrieve with `cheat [command]`, and it would print a few common usages of this command that you might need frequently, but not enough to remember them permanently - especially handy for commands with many options.

/u/xseeks then [suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1k57gj/cheat_allows_you_to_create_and_view_interactive/cbljpw2) that instead of a `.cheat` file, a `.cheat` directory should be used with one file per command, and that compression with `gzip` could save disk space; he also remarked that the script could even be written in bash (chrisallenlane's was python). The `.cheat` directory change was implemented in chrisallenlane's script, but xseeks still went ahead and [reimplemented it](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1k57gj/cheat_allows_you_to_create_and_view_interactive/cblutp5) in `bash`, including `gzip` compression ([direct GitHub link](https://github.com/jahendrie/cheat)).

When I (/u/galaktos) read the usage examples of chrisallenlane's script, I [found myself wanting a bit more functionality](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1k57gj/cheat_allows_you_to_create_and_view_interactive/cblko70): First, I wouldn't want to re-type the command that the script just had printed, but instead execute it directly; and second, I would love to be able to declare variables in the command that would be prompted when I executed the cheat. I first thought this might take several weeks in C (I originally wanted to use JSON as file format - ridiculous), but after thinking a bit more, reading xseeks' file format suggestion, and then moving most of the work into the file format, I managed to [make it in bash](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1k57gj/cheat_allows_you_to_create_and_view_interactive/cbm19wl) in a few hours ([direct GitHub link](https://github.com/lucaswerkmeister/cheats)).

So I started looking for way to scrape the images off of web sites and save them to my drive so that I can put on a nice picture show whilst fapping.  And then it hit me.

I remembered the scene from ""The Social Network"" where our star needed to download a bunch of pics from the school web sites.  One of the lines was, ""just need a little wget magic.""

So I downloaded the win32 version of GNU wget and perused through the documentation.

wget -r -np -Ajpg -X /*/thumbs http://some.porn.site.com/tgp/home.html

-r -- do a recursive get
-np -- do not follow links that leave the parent folder
-Ajpg -- only save files with a .jpg extension
-X /*/thumbs -- we don't want the shitty thumbnail images

If this was to be the case... are there any sane dbus tools that can be used in shell scripting?
I tried using dbus-send command to communicate with a notification daemon and show a notification bubble to no avail.

If it was not the case... would it be possible to develop an alternative replacement to libdbus that instead of using the daemon just went through sockets and avoided a context switch to the dbus process?

This would be particularly nice in du. I know -h will show me size in gigabytes etc. but often I'm monitoring the size of a growing file with:

watch -d du -sh filename

and it might take 10 minutes per gig to generate the file which means that once it hits a gig I only see an update every 10 minutes. I currently see this:

$ du -s file 
1758336 file

$ du -s file

You can do this automatically by adding 
    
     trap ""source ~/.zshrc"" USR1

to your zshrc. This will run the command in quotes when a zsh process receives a USR1 signal. Then add an alias to edit your zshrc/aliases file and send the USR1 signal to all zsh processes when you're done. For example,

    alias a='vim ~/.aliases; pkill -usr1 zsh'

You can do the same thing in bash; I believe the syntax is the same.

Edit: [Source](http://www.unix.com/shell-programming-scripting/159409-how-2-run-same-command-across-all-open-terminals.html)

Edit 2: After you make the above changes, you will have to manually source in all your open terminals, otherwise the USR1 signal will kill them.

Edit 3: Thanks for all the suggestions. For posterity, here is the setup I have now:

In `~/.zshrc`

    trap ""source ~/.zshrc &amp;&amp; rehash"" USR1

For example, if you're in irssi, if you send that to the background, you'd lose your connection, but you'd have to open up another terminal (or terminal tab) to do anything else.  With screen you only have to do Control A c, and nothing will be lost.

Basics: ""screen"" to enter screen.  It looks exactly the same as your regular prompt, but you can tell that you're in screen by doing ctrl A "" . Everything in screen takes Cntl and A pressed at the same time, and then you simply press another key to do the screen action.  This is denoted, in shorthand, by C-a n, with ""C-a"" meaning pressing Ctrl and a at the same time, and n being any other key.

Inside screen you can create new ""windows"" with C-a c
You can name these new windows with C-a A
You can switch between them with C-a 0-9 , or C-a n (for next) or C-a p (for previous) or C-a "" to see a list you can choose from.

C-a k will kill a window.

C-a D will ""detach"".  Screen will still be running (along with all programs inside it), and will until you purposely stop it or reboot your computer (so, for example, if you logout of GUI, you can still get to your programs...they didn't stop).

""screen -r"" will reattach to the session.  This is done outside of screen (after you're detached).  I recommend only having one instance of screen at a time, or else it's kinda a hassle.

C-a S will split the window horizontally.  You would then C-a TAB over to the new section, then do C-a "" to put an active window there, or C-a c to put a new bash command line up.  You can also do C-a | (that's a pipe, not an L or i) to split the window vertically.  To resize a section, you can do C-a :resize # (replace # with a number) then enter.  

C-a ? is the most important one though, because it tells you all these keybindings.

Lately, as the game grows, the compiling takes longer (~8 min) and we've found that sometimes the compiling fails. Our current fix is extending the interval for the cron (we have it at 20 min from 5 min).

Basically what we're doing requires a ci server so I'll be configuring Jenkins.

The cron pulled from the git repo, checked for changes and if they were the flash source was compiled. 
Setting a post-merge hook on git just moves the cron hanging from the ant process to git :P

So if I wanted to collect data every ~30 seconds let's say, is there a way to do this other than having to call iostat to make two reports, and then use tail to only collect the actual stats, not just the stats since boot? What I want to do is write something that will run, gather some quick data from an API (current transactions) and print a report along with the current disk IO.

Things like git are pretty good with doing auto-paging, but all too often I'll run some command, watch a few pages stream by, then kill it and restart `!! | less`. This got me wondering, exactly where should the responsibility for paging lie?  We have a few options:

* The terminal - Either the actual terminal emulator (`xterm`, `rxvt`, `iTerm2`, ...), or a term mux like tmux or GNU Screen.  Screen copy-mode is pretty horrible, not sure about tmux, and almost all actual terminal(-emulators) have pretty poor scrollback support, compared with a real paging capability like `less`/`most`. It would certainly be possible to add paging in here, but it seems perhaps a bit too low-level to be execing a filter process and streaming through it, when all it should really be doing is interpreting escape sequences and putting characters onscreen. 

In my quests, I did come across this infuriating snippet in the Screen manpage:

&gt;      exec !..| less
    |less 

&gt; This adds a pager to the window output. The special character `|` is needed to give the user control over the pager although it gets its input from the window's process. This works, because less listens on stderr (a behavior that screen would not expect without the `|`) when its stdin is not a tty. **Less versions newer than 177 fail miserably here**

    $ less --version
    less 444

    :(
* The shell - It is responsible for hooking up your stdin/out/err during process invocation I think, which could give it the option of plumbing a pager into there.
Obviously you'd probably want a white/blacklist of which processes to handle, because things expecting to be talking direct to a tty for full-screen things like curses/editors probably wouldn't work that well.
In addition, lots of apps already use `isatty()` or similar to decide whether to use coloured output or to change the output format (which, given that `less -R` handles colouring just fine, is sometimes really irritating)


* Individual apps - How it currently works, `git`, `man`, and anything else that respects `$PAGER`

It's a crapload of effort to build it in at the app level though, so I think it really does need to an infrastructure thing.

I've seen a few cute hacks like [colourising STDERR](http://serverfault.com/questions/59262/bash-print-stderr-in-red-color) with some exec/redirect magic at the shell(?) level.

[stderred](https://github.com/sickill/stderred) takes a more hardcore approach of hooking `*write()` libc calls with `LD_PRELOAD`, but both of these solutions strike me as quite brittle and hacky.

* The user - quit being such a lazy bastard and just type the `|less` or alias your favourite commands or make a special keybinding or something.  That's what I'm doing now, and I still regularly screw it up. On top of that, aliases/bindings aren't ideal for all situations, and if a solution were inserted far enough up the hierarchy, I could imagine it Just Working for the output of remote commands via ssh, for example.


So, this is a call for suggestions, either of existing methods that could be re-purposed, or where and how this problem should be approached.

    locate &lt;searchterm&gt; # looks for the string &lt;searchterm&gt; in the file names of every file on the system you can see.

**Screen**

    Control a c # create a new window

    Control a k # kill current window

    Control a n # go to next window

    control a p # go to previous window

    control a d # detaches from window

    find . -name ""whatever"" -exec &lt;command with options&gt; {} \; # same as above, but for all files found, it does the command told to the file

    grep ""whatever"" filename # searches inside file for ""whatever""

    grep -r ""whatever"" . # searches inside every file in current directory, recursively, for ""whatever""

The problem is that the first thing bash does is open the redirection files, which means truncating the output file. By the time `sed` start reading from `contacts.txt`, it's already empty.

I used to get around this by using temporary files, which I would later rename, but that was obviously a kludge. The solution I've found is to use a code block for the output. So the above attempt would be rewritten to:

    sed 's/John/Jon/' &lt;contacts.txt | { cat &gt;contacts.txt; }

The semicolon inside the curly braces is important. Bash will complain if it's not there (zsh has no problem with or without it).

I have created these shell scripts to help me synchronize misaligned downloaded subtitles to the corresponding movie.

First you have to find the correct time for displaying the 1st &amp; last line by just playing the video file.

Then you run the synsubcalc.sh script, that calculates the delay &amp; multiplier for matching the times.

If for example the downloaded .srt has marked the 1st line at 0 hours 1 minute 12.35 seconds and you want to move this to 0 hours 2 minutes 44 seconds &amp; the last line is incorrectly marked at 1hrs 34mins 3secs but it should be at 1hrs 41mins 12secs, you would type

synsubcalc.sh 0:1:12.35 0:2:44 1:34:3 1:41:12

This would calculate a delay &amp; multiplier.

Then you just run the second script synchrosubs.sh [filename.srt] [delay] [multiplier] &gt; newfile.srt

If I wasn't too bored I could combine the two scripts into one, but I like to pretend that it is a feature.:)

I hope you find this useful.

I like using redshift/flux but they can really make videos and games look bad.

Manually disabling it kills my eyes when I switch to another window so I made a quick script to disable redshift whenever a window with a matching name is fullscreen and focused.

You need xprop (xorg-xprop), redshift and stdbuf.

Just add a window name to the array to make it run on it.

This can probably be modified to support flux or you could remove the fullscreen requirement.

You need to add parameters to commands and look up the escape codes, which are not easy to find. I have made this simple ""library"" to add color in an easier way.

Special formatting modifiers:

$bold, $underline, $dim, $strickthrough, $blink, $reverse, $hidden

Each can be used by itself or together. To clear all the options including colors, use:

$normal  

Color modifiers:

$black, $red, $green, $orange, $blue, $purple, $aqua, $gray, $darkgray,
$lightred, $lightgreen, $lightyellow, $lightblue, $lightpurple, $lightaqua, $white

All color options are case sensitive! ALL CAPS modifies background, all lowercase modifies foreground.

$RED would highlight the text with red.
$red would change the color of the text to red.

To clear a color (still case sensitive):

$default

Remember, the colors are caried over newlines.

Hint: you can use colors right next to text with backslashes: $red\text

Example usage:

echo $blue this is blue $RED$black\This is black with red background $underline\this is underlined $normal\normal

Copy and paste this into your script:

    bold=`echo -en ""\e[1m""`; underline=`echo -en ""\e[4m""`; dim=`echo -en ""\e[2m""`; strickthrough=`echo -en ""\e[9m""`; blink=`echo -en ""\e[5m""`; reverse=`echo -en ""\e[7m""`; hidden=`echo -en ""\e[8m""`; normal=`echo -en ""\e[0m""`; black=`echo -en ""\e[30m""`; red=`echo -en ""\e[31m""`; green=`echo -en ""\e[32m""`; orange=`echo -en ""\e[33m""`; blue=`echo -en ""\e[34m""`; purple=`echo -en ""\e[35m""`; aqua=`echo -en ""\e[36m""`; gray=`echo -en ""\e[37m""`; darkgray=`echo -en ""\e[90m""`; lightred=`echo -en ""\e[91m""`; lightgreen=`echo -en ""\e[92m""`; lightyellow=`echo -en ""\e[93m""`; lightblue=`echo -en ""\e[94m""`; lightpurple=`echo -en ""\e[95m""`; lightaqua=`echo -en ""\e[96m""`; white=`echo -en ""\e[97m""`; default=`echo -en ""\e[39m""`; BLACK=`echo -en ""\e[40m""`; RED=`echo -en ""\e[41m""`; GREEN=`echo -en ""\e[42m""`; ORANGE=`echo -en ""\e[43m""`; BLUE=`echo -en ""\e[44m""`; PURPLE=`echo -en ""\e[45m""`; AQUA=`echo -en ""\e[46m""`; GRAY=`echo -en ""\e[47m""`; DARKGRAY=`echo -en ""\e[100m""`; LIGHTRED=`echo -en ""\e[101m""`; LIGHTGREEN=`echo -en ""\e[102m""`; LIGHTYELLOW=`echo -en ""\e[103m""`; LIGHTBLUE=`echo -en ""\e[104m""`; LIGHTPURPLE=`echo -en ""\e[105m""`; LIGHTAQUA=`echo -en ""\e[106m""`; WHITE=`echo -en ""\e[107m""`; DEFAULT=`echo -en ""\e[49m""`;

I would just use the usual `[[ ""$TERM"" != ""screen"" ]] &amp;&amp; exec tmux` except that line leads to session-number bloat and the potential for zombie sessions. `dtach` does everything I want (with similar auto-`exec`-ing functionality in my .bashrc), except that when I am in the text console, I am deprived of the compact display of information such as the clock and the battery charge (quite crucial on my laptop!) which are provided by both `tmux` and my window manager.

",angrylawyer,16,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/l4c9o/looking_for_a_grep_alternative_i_need_to_search_a/,"tldr; I I need to run a search for email addresses in a log file from one of our mail servers. 

&gt; grep -f emails.txt mail.log 

There's about 110k items in the emails.txt file, so I get 'memory exhausted' errors. I was wondering if there was a better way to accomplish this type of search. 


long version, because maybe somebody can tell me a better way to do this. I need to count all the unique email addresses we've tried to email to but have been deferred, and not sent. So my process sort of looks like this right now: 

- egrep the log file to create a smaller log file containing just lines with status=sent and status=deferred
- grep for lines containing status=sent, use perl to extract email address and sort &gt; sent.txt
- grep for lines containing status=deferred, use perl to extract email address and sort &gt; deferred.txt
- use comm to remove lines from the deferred.txt file *that also appear in the sent.txt file* &gt; deferredNotSent.txt

Then I would like to: 

- grep -f deferredNotSent.txt mail.log | perl to grab email addresses, count, and sort

However, that last step gives me the 'memory exhausted' error. 

The reason I need this last step is because I need to go back to the log file and count how many times each email address has deferred us. I can't count the emails in deferredNotSent.txt because the comm command needs only unique values in sent.txt and deferred.txt to correctly compare them.

The problem is my sar data has gaps because I suspend the computer every night for 8 hours. I'd like to graph my load averages using gnuplot, and unfortunately having gaps in the log files causes problems for graph plotting. 

Here is an example of the problem: http://i.imgur.com/Si4Q2cq.png

As you can see the effect of gaps in the log file is bad graph data.

So I'd like to automatically detects gaps, and insert values.

The problem is detecting the gaps in the timestamp is hard.

Here is an example of the gap:

    ...
    01:35:01 0.90 0.99 0.90
    01:40:01 0.53 0.78 0.85
    01:45:01 0.42 0.67 0.81

    08:25:01 0.74 0.65 0.79
    08:30:01 0.40 0.50 0.69
    ...



I've not found any cmd that does this kind of thing, so I've started scripting it in bash.

I've thought of a few ways to implement this, but none of them seem ideal.

I'm about to refactor some scripts written by ex-coworkers and want to get rid of some very ugly hacks.

So basically I need a function, e.g. ""detect_hardware"", that will return a string that I can then use to make further decisions on what to configure etc. pp. I'm aware, that there are nicer, more generic ways to make those choices, but for reasons I don't want to elaborate on I need to do it that way :) 

I'm thinking on creating an associative array (we use Bash v4) of hash-values to hardware-types.


    function hw_detect ()
    {
  
        declare -A HW_TYPES

        HW_TYPES=(
          [""dl120_g7""]=""b0afe3b6316d87581213980657809318""
          [""rx200_s4""]=""91d4a8fd5a914822eb7c42e702acc2a8""
        )
    [...]
    }

After several attempts and trying around I ended up with this grown oneliner to get the hash-value:

    dmidecode -q -t system -t processor|sed -n -e 's/^.*Product Name:[[:space:]]\+\(.*\)[[:space:]]*$/\1/p' -e 's/^.*Version:[[:space:]]\+\(.*\)[[:space:]]*$/\1/p'|md5sum|cut -d"" "" -f 1

Unfortunately not all the platforms have meaningful values in the output of dmidecode -t system or similar ressources, so I ended up combining the outputs for processor and system. I have to take care of the case, that some hardware parts may have changed and are non-unique.

I think this looks rather hacky, so before I invest more time in improving that way, does someone have a better idea that will work for my purpose? 
As I said, I need it to work that way or else I will have a lot more work to do. That's not worth the time, as the systems will be re-created over the year.

There are lots of ways to always run a program on a particular desktop (based on program name, window class, etc.), but not a single command.

So I wrote **runon**, which tries to do this to the best of its ability. There are a couple reasons this is difficult. First, it's not easy to match a PID to an X window id. This is because X is designed to work over a network, and in that use case a PID is all but useless. The other reason is that the program's window may not open as soon as it starts running (if ever, and I don't know any way short of decompiling the program to tell if it will open a window).

So, when you use runon to run a program, it monitors the list of windows for one that advertizes the right PID and moves that window. A program may not tag their windows with their PID -- it's completely optional -- but most of the programs I tried this with played nicely.

You can invoke runon as follows:

    runon &lt;workspace&gt; &lt;command...&gt;

This will run the given command, then move the resulting window to the workspace specified. There are two formats for workspace:

* `+n` or `-n`: Move the window n desktops to the right (+) or left (-)
* `name`:     Move the window to the desktop with the given name

You can get runon here: http://pastebin.com/TrbA9jz4 It's written for zsh and requires wmctrl. It will only work with window managers that support EWMH (most popular ones do, I believe).

I started a project called [clicraft](http://dmbuce.github.com/clicraft/) a while back. It's basically just a script that wraps around and provides functionality for a server (a Minecraft server, but that's not important) that would otherwise be difficult to control from the command line.

Simplifying a bit, this server has essentially two ways to interface with it: you can parse the log file for whatever messages the server might be dumping there, and you can send commands to it on stdin (not shell commands, they are commands that are interpreted by the server and affect its internal state).

**The Problem**

The commands do not have return codes/exit codes indicating success or failure, and when sending commands to the server, there's no easy way to wait until the command finishes before continuing on in the script. The best you can do is guess when the command finished and whether it was successful or not based on the log. I'd like to figure out how to do that in a robust way.

**The Solution?**

Look at this ugly thing I created:

TIMEOUT and SERVER_DIR are set earlier in the script. `warn` is a function that prints to stderr. Everything else should be self-contained. [Here](https://github.com/DMBuce/clicraft/blob/serverlog/src/lib/functions.sh#L142) is the function in context. I was gonna walk through it in pseudocode, but I think my comments explain my intent well enough. I hope.

**Questions**

1. In the `else` bit, I've got two consecutive `tail`s that are identical aside from where their output is going. Any way to mash them together?
2. The `tail -fn0 --pid $TIMEPID /dev/null` portion near the end seems hokey. Is there a better way to wait around until another process exits?
3. Just in general, I feel like I'm abusing tail and maybe sleep and/or kill and/or anonymous functions. Any suggestions for cleaning this up would be most appreciated.
4. Speaking more generally, any comments/suggestions/criticisms not directly related to the above would be most welcome.

**Disclaimers**

* \^Sorry about that wall of text
* I realize there are languages like C that are probably better suited for this tasked
* If you happen to look at the commits for the branch this is on, I am so, so sorry.

Well one specific part of it.  Let's say you're in a directory that contains 3 subdirectories: foo, foobar, and foobarski.  Now let's also say that you want to view the contents of the foobarski subdir.

In DOS, you can type dir f, then tab, tab, tab and it will cycle through the subdirs and select foobarski for you.  

In bash (and I'm guessing other Unix shells), if you type ls f tab, you get nothing, but if you type ls f tab tab, it gives you a list of possible completions, namely your subdirectories but you have to type more characters to narrow down in the list.

Maybe there's a way to emulate this in bash.  It is one thing I like better in cmd.exe.  However, the command completion in DOS blows in other ways e.g. you're type out a long command, make a mistake and go back to try it again.  If you move the cursor back into the middle of the command and try to auto-complete the name of a file or directory, in DOS, you'll lose everything trailing your edit.  Unix shells don't do that.

I tethered my netbook to my phone, which is great, but I need to make sure I don't run over my monthly data usage on my data plan.

So, I wrote a simple script to handle this for me. Since I care about total down and up, it adds them and converts to MB. It prints like so: `hh:mm:ss        &lt;down&gt;MB`, where hours are 24 hour. The device name I'm using is usb0, so change it to the right device for your machine if you want to try it out.

One (long) liner:

It's also possible to use custom key bindings to execute macros and commands. We'll start with Bash's `bind` builtin. The general usage is:

`    bind '""key sequence"":""macro""'`

For instance, if you wanted to bind `ctrl-o` to insert the text ""&gt; output"" at the current cursor position, you would use:

`    bind '""\C-o"": ""&gt; output""'`

With this, you can type `help bind CTRL-o` and it becomes `help bind &gt; output`. If you only want to bind the key sequence in a specific readline mode you can use the `-m` switch to specify a mode. The following will only bind ctrl-o in vi insert mode.

`    bind -m vi-insert '""\C-o"": ""&gt; output""'`

You can also use key bindings to do a bit more complicated things like insert a ""for"" loop and leave the cursor after the ""in"":

`    bind -m vi-insert '""\C-lf"":""for i in ;do ;done\eBBi""'`

This will make `ctrl-l f` insert ""`for i in ;do ;done`"" in vi insert mode. To do the same thing in emacs mode you would use (N.B. I'm using `esc-f` instead of `ctrl-l f` since `ctrl-l` clears the screen in emacs mode. See the list of escape sequences at the end of this post.):

`    bind -m emacs '""^[f"":""for i in ;do ;done^[b^[b\C-b""'`

to insert ""for i in ;do ;done"" and then move the cursor back two words and one character. We can also do interesting things like quoting the word under the cursor:

`    bind -m vi-command '""\C-l\"""":""Bi\""\ewwa\""\e""'`

`    bind -m emacs '""^[\"""":""^[b\""^[f\""""'`

You can also bind keys to execute commands without disturbing the text on the current line. Imagine that you've entered a long, complicated command and realize that you need to be up one level in the directory tree. You can bind a key sequence to do that. For example `esc-d` in emacs mode or `ctrl-l d` in vi mode:

`    bind -m emacs -x '""^[d"":""cd .. &amp;&amp; echo $PWD""'`

`    bind -m vi-insert -x '""\C-ld"":""cd .. &amp;&amp; echo $PWD""'`

Other key bindings allow you to match partial history commands à la the way the ipython shell will complete a partially entered line from your python history by pressing the up and down arrows:

`    bind '""\e[A""':history-search-backward`

`    bind '""\e[B""':history-search-forward`

`    bind -m vi-command '""k""':history-search-backward`

`    bind -m vi-command '""j""':history-search-forward`

You can also set key bindings for all programs that use readline or for specific programs or even specific terminals by using the file `~/.inputrc`. An example inputrc:

    $include /etc/inputrc
    
    $if Bash
        set editing-mode vi
    $endif
    
    $if Python
        set editing-mode vi
        ""\C-li"": ""if :\ei""
        ""\C-lf"": ""for i in :\ei""
    $endif
    
    $if Ruby
        set editing-mode emacs
    $endif


# **Escape Sequences**

    \C-         control prefix
    \M-         meta prefix
    \e          an escape character
    \\          backslash
    \""          "", a double quotation mark
    \'          ', a single quote or apostrophe
    \a          alert (bell)

EDIT: I think the title (my question) is asking the wrong question... 
Here is some further clarification.

        someCommand=$(cat /etc/somelog) # array content
		array=($someCommand) # array creation
		arrayLen=${#array[@]} # array length 	

		for (( i=0; i&lt;${arrayLen}; i++ ));  # for loop iterates for array length 
		do
		  echo ""$(($i + 1 )) ${arr[$i]/#/someprefix}""   # adds some prefix (for readability )
		  # $(($i + 1 )) appends number list (for clear options) starting at 1
		   
		done		

		printf ""\n""
		echo ""Please enter 1-${arrayLen} --&gt; ""		# asks the user for input

		read anwser		# stores the value (a case statement woud be better
		# to replace the for loop as well - but this is a concept script) just trying to get it to work.

            ### this is what I need help with ###

This is an animated ""screensaver"" for the terminal.  

[Official link](http://www.robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/html/)

I'm going to walk through how to do it if you're new to the command line.  It's very straightfoward if you know linux.  I recommend actually typing out the commands instead of just copy-pasting.

**To Install (for dummies)**

Go to your choice of a working directory, doesn't matter where

    mkdir ~/games/

    cd ~/games/

Download the package:

    wget http://www.robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/asciiquarium.tar.gz

Decompress the package

    tar zxvf asciiquarium*

I suggest reading the README

    cd asciiquarium*

    less README #press q to exit

Test out asciiquarium

    perl asciiquarium

It may or may not work.  It depends whether you have Term::Animation perl module added.  If you do, skip to the last section.

**If you don't have Term::Animation**

Go to any directory you want...doesn't matter so I went one directory up
    cd ../

Download Term Animation
    wget http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Term/Term-Animation-2.4.tar.gz  #or whatever the newest version is

Untar....
    tar zvxf Term-Animation*

Enter the directory, read the README.
    cd Term-Animation*
    less README #press q to exit

The installation instructions are simple
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

You may (correction: probably) need to install another module called Curses.  

**If You Don't Have Curses**

download, untar, readme latest version
    cd ~/games/
    wget http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/Curses/Curses-1.28.tgz
    tar zxvf Curses*
    cd Curses*
    less README #q to exit

The README is terrible...it doesn't tell you how to install.  Try 
    less INSTALL

These are the commands to install Curses
    ./configure    
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    sudo make install

If successful, you should have Curses installed

**Now Let's Try It**

    cd ~/games/asciiquarium*
    perl asciiquarium

Does it work?  It should.  Unless I messed up

Now turn the file into an executable
    
    chmod +x asciiquarium

and copy it to your PATH so that you don't have to be in this directory to use the command ""asciiquarium""

    sudo cp asciiquarium /usr/games/asciiquarium

Now you can issue the command ""asciiquarium"" anywhere!

**To Use**

Not much here to say.  As far as I know, just press q to leave it.  

The program looks better in a virtual terminal, because it fills up the entire screen, and is black instead of grayish.  Control Alt F2 to go to the second virtual terminal, then issue the command.

`cd /to/very/annoying/long/directory` 

I work there for a bit, but now I want to 

`cd /to/very/annoying/different/long/directory`

They are both very similar but usually have one minor difference. WIthout using my mouse to copy paste, I basically want to put contents of `pwd` on the command line, and then use alt-b to back up to what I want to change. A lot of times I didn't just cd right into that directory, so using CTRL-R isn't helpful. To me if my hand leave the keyboard I get annoyed.

So, any ideas?


Edit:

Thanks all who helped. So after looking at my flow....basically the endings will always be the same but the thing that changes is the server name which is buried in the middle. I had no idea about the `$PWD` variable so I just basically manipulate that depending on the server number.

Edit 2:

This is what I ended up doing:

I put some cd aliases for the usual starting directories I use. Then when I need to change the servername (which is buried in the middle, I use this function....

    sd () 
    { 
        cd ${PWD/""$1""/""$2""/}
    }

Usually I'm in our backup system that corresponds with a server....

so if I'm in `/some/directory/with/servername01/bla/blah/directory/etc/named

I'll switch to another backup set with:

    sd servername01 servername03

[zsh+python2],Altinus,14,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1d2owz/setting_variables_based_on_regexp_matches/,"A problem I often come across in the command line is extracting matches from regular expressions. Using sed for this can be clumsy. Thus, I have written this zsh function using python2.

    # Read variables from matches of a regexp
    mread() {
    python2 -u -c '
    import sys, re
    rexp = re.compile(sys.argv[1])
    while 1:
      line = sys.stdin.readline()
      if not line:
        exit(1)
      m = rexp.search(line.rstrip(""\n""))
      if m:
        if m.lastindex:
          print(""\0"".join(m.groups()))
        else:
          print(m.group(0))
        exit(0)
    ' ""$1"" | { IFS=$(echo ""\0"") read -r ""$@[2,-1]"" }
    }


Now, writing

    mread &lt;pattern&gt; &lt;variable name&gt;...

will set the values of the given variables to the matching groups in the first match of the standard input. If the pattern contains no groups, the first variable is set to the whole match.

For example:

    $ echo ""file.txt"" | mread '(.*)\.(.*)' base ext
    $ echo ""$base"" - ""$ext""
    file - txt

I made sure that the function works well in loops (only the first match per line is used):

    $ echo ""file.txt\nscript.sh"" | while mread '(.*)\.(.*)' base ext; do
    &gt;     echo ""$base"" - ""$ext""
    &gt; done
    file - txt
    script - sh

Criticism and improvements are welcome.
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get this to work with bash or python3.

Edit: Made a few improvements, thanks to chipaca.

Edit2: 0sse's comment gives rise to this much simpler function which doesn't use python:

    # Read variables from matches of a regexp
    mread() {
        while read -r line; do 
            if [[ ""$line"" =~ ""$1"" ]]; then
                (IFS=$'\0'; echo -E ""${match[*]}"") \
                    | {IFS=$'\0' read -r ""$@[2,-1]""}
                return 0
            fi
        done
        return 1
    }

I have to read a list with comma-separated values. I read it line by line with a little c-program i wrote.
In each line the first value (before the first comma) is automatically entered into the shell and the response written to a file. 
Problem is that it just isn't working with scripts taking up multiple lines. 
Now i could tweak my program and might get it to work after some serious effort but i wondered if there is a way to simply put several lines of bash into a single line (maybe there are some separators i don't know about?). 
I'm fairly new to linux so if you have any other smart ideas let me know :)

I'm curious, is it possible to merge many moves into one command without the use of a loop?

That way I only need to type ""`!?switch`"" to swap them... Now I was wondering if there was a way to reduce the three mv commands into one, something along what one would expect ""`sudo mv www{{,2}{1,}{2,1}}`"" would do if you could nest braces and keep the mv.

Yes, I could do this in a function, but this is more of a curiosity thing than anything.

The host computer first has to have sshd installed (assuming it's Unix based).  Then you have to forward port 22 to it...I'm used to doing that by going to routerlogin.net which connects to your router and going to port forwarding.  I can't give you too much information on that, since it all depends on what kind of router you have at home, and a bunch of other factors.  But anyway, once the host machine has it, you simply do 
""ssh -p 22 name@host""
Host will usually be the IP address.  You can probably leave the p 22 out since that's the default port.  ""name"" is important since by default it will use the name you're on on your current machine.  You have to specify the name you want to login on on the host machine.  You can also enable X (GUI) by doing ""ssh -x host"".  

With ssh you can pretty much do whatever you can do on a command line.  It's great if certain things are banned on your current computer.  For example, if you can't use IRC at work, you can simply tunnel it through ssh from your home computer.  

also, many universities give you shell access to..you should try that out to access your school account from home.

I am searching Cisco configs to see if a vlan is listed on a trunk. 

Example text:

    switchport trunk allowed vlan 2,5,25-110,125
    switchport trunk allowed vlan 6,10,50-75,110
    switchport trunk allowed vlan 4,7-10,35-91,115
    switchport trunk allowed vlan 26,45,109,125

I would like to search these lines to see if any lines allow vlan 90. So in the above text, lines 1 and 3 would be listed as a result. I prefer that the result lists the actual line and not the line number.

The only way I've thought to do this is use sed to make the numbers on each side of the dashes a variable and then iterate over the range to match my search. It seems like there has got to be a better way.

###Original text for those interested

I'm likely going to explain this clumsily, so apologies in advance:

I have the following script:


    #!/bin/bash
    
    pidPrefix=""logGen""
    
    
    checkPrime ()
    {
      if /sbin/ifconfig eth0:0|/bin/grep -wq inet;then isPrime=1;else isPrime=0;fi
    }
    
    killScript ()
    {
      /usr/bin/find /var/run -name ""${pidPrefix}.*.pid"" |while read pidFile;do
        if [[ ! ""${pidFile}"" =~ ""${$}"" ]];then
          #/bin/kill $(/usr/bin/tail -1 ${pidFile})
          /bin/kill $(/bin/cat ${pidFile})
          /bin/rm ${pidFile}
        fi
      done
    }
    echo ""$$"" &gt; /var/run/${pidPrefix}.$$.pid
    killScript
    #  echo ""$$"" &gt; /var/run/${pidPrefix}.$$.pid
       tail -F -n0 /opt/REDACTED/logs/manager.log|while read -a  i;do
        if [[ ""${i[2]}"" == ""E"" ]];then
          if [[ ""${i[7]:0:1}"" == ""@"" ]];then
            echo ""${i[0]}|${i[1]}|${i[6]}|${i[@]:8:${#i[@]}}"" &gt;&gt; /tmp/allerrors.${i[0]//\//.}.log
          else
            echo ""${i[0]}|${i[1]}|${i[6]}|${i[@]:7:${#i[@]}}"" &gt;&gt; /tmp/allerrors.${i[0]//\//.}.log
          fi
        fi
      done

The bulk of it you can ignore, the main points are:

 * the function `killScript` is meant to check for lock files in /var/run (excluding lock files created by the current instance of the script) and kill the pid inside the lock file. 

 * a tail is kicked off against a log file, and the output parsed into a separate logfile (if anyone actually cares, I can show sample input for the script, and explain what everything does, but it's not really relevant to my problem). 

 * The goal is that this script is run periodically on cron. Every time it's run, the last running instance of the script is killed, and a new one is started

So here's the issue. The script starts a child process, and just killing the first processes pid doesn't kill the child process. It just keeps running and running until manually killed. As seen below:

 * `[root@liwmgmt02 utils]# bash new.logGen.sh #kick of an instance of the script`
 * `[root@liwmgmt02 utils]# ps -ef|grep [n]ew.log #in a separate terminal check pids`  
    `root     11391  7109  0 16:51 pts/1    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
    `root     11395 11391  0 16:51 pts/1    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
 * So now the script is running, and there are two pids
 * `[root@liwmgmt02 utils]# bash new.logGen.sh #in separate terminal start a second instance`
 * In the first terminal the script exited back to a prompt and says `Terminated`
 * `[root@liwmgmt02 utils]# ps -ef|grep [n]ew.log`  
`root     11395     1  0 16:51 pts/1    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
`root     14623 10569  0 16:52 pts/3    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
`root     14630 14623  0 16:52 pts/3    00:00:00 bash new.logGen.sh`  
 * and now I have the child process of the script still running and doing stuff. 

So yeah, this is my problem. How can I accomplish my goal of making a script that can previous instances of itself when it's run if the script spawns child processes?

Note: I'd like to think I'm a fairly decent shell scripter, but I'm really not all that great at understanding things like processes and subprocesses and stuff like that. So if this is a really dumb question to have...sorry. Also, this is far from done, I still have to add error checking and comments and tidy up and whatnot. But I've hit this issue and I don't know how to proceed. 

Also, I've been reading up on adding traps to my scripts. I think I kind of understand what they are/how they work, but I'm still struggling with it.

As far as I know, bash pipes (or well.. bourne shell's) only work for redirecting the standard output.  There's the ""|&amp;"" operand  but it's just a shortcut for ""2&gt;&amp;1 |"" which pipes both stderr and stdout, there's no builtin way to pipe only stderr and not stdout.

After some Googling I found you can switch stderr (fd 2) and stdout (fd 1) by using a third file descriptor (fd 3), doing something like this:

    test 3&gt;&amp;2 1&gt;&amp;3 2&gt;&amp;1

This, for example, works as expected (rot13 from bsd-games)

    $ { echo ""stderr"" 1&gt;&amp;2; echo ""stdout""; } 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3 | rot13
    stdout
    fgqree

However, this redirects the program's output to the error output, and that's not very elegant if it was content intended to be shown in stdout

I thought about reading the variable from stdout by piping it and then after that, switch it back

    { test 3&gt;&amp;2 1&gt;&amp;3 2&gt;&amp;1 | read var } 3&gt;&amp;2 1&gt;&amp;3 2&gt;&amp;1

This also works as expected, as confirmed by this (pig also from bsd-games):

    $  { { echo ""stderr"" 1&gt;&amp;2; echo ""stdout""; } 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3 | rot13; } 3&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;2 2&gt;&amp;3 | pig
    outstday

However, none of these 2 ways seem to work for the ""dialog"" program (at least for me) any idea why?

Because bash doesn't seem to.,WishCow,10,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/l24qg/is_there_a_shell_that_can_handle_arrays_well/,"I'm not bashing bash. I love it, really, but the array support seems so much of an afterthought, like OOP was in PHP4.

Please correct me if I'm wrong in any of these points: (all of the assumptions are for bash &gt;4.0)

1) It is not possible to pass an associative array to a function, without it losing it's keys  
2) It is not possible to pass in more than one indexed array to a function  
3) Passing 1 indexed array to a function is only possible, if these two criterias are met:  
  a) the array MUST be the last parameter  
  b) all of the parameters before the last parameter are mandatory, you cannot pass in less than the expected number  

I think the first point is pretty self-explanatory. The second point is impossible, because you cannot reliably split the ""$@"" variable into N arrays, because you would need to know, in advance, how many elements are in the passed arrays. The third point is impossible, for a similar reason, if you know your function expects 3 scalar parameters, and 1 array, you can do:

func() {
    param1=""$1""
    param2=""$2""
    param3=""$3""
    shift 3
    declare -a localarray=(""$@"")
}

But if you call it with 2 scalars, like this:

declare -a array=(a b c)  
func 1 2 ""${array[@]}""

It would lead to 'a' being assigned to $3, and $localarray == (b c).

So, can someone show me a solution, for:

a) How can I pass an associative array to a function  
b) How can I pass N arrays to a function  

Solutions with helper methods/variables are welcome, as long as they scale well (scale, as in ease of usage, I don't care about performance).

If it is not possible, is it possible to do it in ZSH, KSH, or any other shell? Or I'm asking for too much of a shell, and should resort to perl/ruby/php/python?

go through each folder and subfolder, merging everything with a similar name

[Imgur Script](https://github.com/manabutameni/Imgur)



    +-----+
    |ABOUT|
    +-----+
    
    This is a 100% Bash script used to download imgur albums while making sure that
    the order of the pictures is retained. The script now allows for multi-file
    support.
    
      usage: ./imgur.sh [-cpsm] [file] URL
      This script is used solely to download imgur albums.
    
      OPTIONS:
        -h Show this message.
        -m &lt;File&gt; Download multiple albums found in &lt;File&gt;.
        -c Clean and Remove nonalphanumeric characters from the album's name.
        -p Preserve imgur's naming. (Warning! This will not retain order.)
        -s Silent mode.
    
    Thanks to everyone in this thread who helped me out.
    http://redd.it/webn1
    Special Thanks goes to Reddit users:
    Ihasn and Skaarj for help on the base code during the early stages.
    invisiblescars for the idea and original code for a kde4 context menu.
    
    Compatible with:
      Linux
      Unix
      OS X
    
    +-----+
    |USAGE|
    +-----+
    
    The script was created so that all that you need to do is copy+paste
    the address bar link into the terminal.
    
    chmod +x imgur.sh
    ./imgur.sh -h
    
    If you want to use the multiple-files feature then you will need to have
    a plain text file with imgur album URLs seperated by new lines
    
    ./imgur.sh -m Imgur-Albums-List.txt
    
    Special note: If you do use the -m flag it must be the last option.
    E.X. ./imgur.sh -scm Imgur-Albums-List.txt
    
    +------------+
    |INSTALLATION|
    +------------+
    
    This is only if you want to reference the script without having it in
    the directory you want the imgur album.
    
    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
    sudo chown `whoami` /usr/local/bin
    cd /usr/local/bin
    curl https://raw.github.com/manabutameni/Imgur/master/imgur.sh -o imgur
    chmod +x imgur
    PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin # only if you haven't done this already
    export PATH
    
    To use:
    imgur http://www.imgur.com/a/XXXXX
    
    +--------------+
    |FOR KDE4 USERS|
    +--------------+
    
    There is a file named imgur.desktop with you in mind.
    Simply copy to your local `kde4-config --path services` location and
    make sure it's executable. chmod +x imgur.desktop.
    
    To use: Simply copy the url of an imgur album and right click on
    An empty area in dolphin. Under actions you should see ""Imgur Album DL"".

The answer as provided by Dislexsick, is to use cut:

cut -f 1 -d ' '  sourcefile_where_your_data_is.txt and this will show all the first words for every line.

If you needed the second word from every line then swap the 1 for a 2. The -d ' ' is a delimiter, meaning that it will identify the end of every word he needs to show when it finds a space

For example, i have all of this data on a file:

john doe 1234 ABCDEFD

jane johnson 191923423 ABC

mohammed rodriguez 9999999999999999 GHTD

I typically work on a number of different machines and find it very useful to have different coloured backgrounds in the terminal sessions I have open to them. For example I have the production machines' backgrounds set to a very vivid red, it's an instant reminder that I'm working on live and to triple-check everything that I'm doing.

Until recently I've been using gnome-terminal as my xterm emulator, and I have a series of aliases similar to this:

    alias ProductionBox='/usr/bin/gnome-terminal --title mylogin@production.box --window-with-profile Production'
and I have a gnome-terminal profile called ""Production"" which sets the background to red, initiates an ssh connection to the appropriate machine, etc.

Recently I've become a huge fan of the [Terminator](http://software.jessies.org/terminator/) xterm emulator and in particular its ability to have multiple sessions in a single window by making use of horizontal and vertical splits. So I'd much rather use this now than have half a dozen separate gnome-terminal windows scattered around my desktop.

But I can't find a way to change the background colour of a Terminator session while it's running. Obviously there are different profiles available, but is it possible to tell the current window to adopt a new profile without having to right-click and select the relevant profile. Ideally I'd like all of this to be encapsulated into an alias as I do at the moment.

But could it be done with bash? Is such a thing even possible? Yes, it is[.](http://e.asset.soup.io/asset/3240/4414_a356.gif)

`ps aux` shows in the STAT-column S+ for foreground, S for background and T for halted (`Ctrl-Z` but no `bg`). We can use this information in the following way:

    ps -p &lt;pid&gt; -o stat= # Get the state for &lt;pid&gt; without the STAT-header

From which we shall create a function:

    isF(){ if [ ""$(ps -p $$ -o stat=)"" = ""S+"" ]; then return 0; else return 1; fi }
    # $$ is the script's pid

which will exit with 1 if script is running foreground, 0 if not.

This could be used to limit output when backgrounded.

    isF(){ if [ ""$(ps -p $$ -o stat=)"" = ""S+"" ]; then return 0; else return 1; fi }

So what I want to do is create a list of ports being used on the local *or* foreign column (column 2 or 3). It doesn't matter what the IP is. So what I want is one line for each port used. I hope this makes sense.


EDIT 2: Here is the script that I've came up with to sort out the ports...

    while read line; do
     echo $line|cut -d ' ' -f2 | cut -d ':' -f2 | tee -a allports.txt
     echo $line|cut -d ' ' -f3 | cut -d ':' -f2 | tee -a allports.txt
    done&lt; netstat.txt
    sort -u allports.txt &gt; uniqueports.txt
    while read line; do
     grep -m1 $line netstat.txt | tee -a uniquelines.txt
    done&lt; uniqueports.txt

This would give me

pass in a complete email, and return on STDOUT the best guess URL for an unsubscribe link.

Why, you might ask?  Because there are 100 emails a day I get, and the time it takes to sift through and find the unsubscribe link is nontrivial, can be 20 seconds to 3 minutes.  Also, in most emails, the data needed to find this link by algorithm is all included.


Emails are complex beasts, with hierarchical formats, some text some HTML, and some attachments.  The different ways people specify their unsub links are varied too, some services put details in a header, some use plain text, some use HTML multiparts.

I like playing around and writing some glitch scripts (with sed and convert). Trying not to mess the image header is important. so I came across this cool [glitch generator](http://blog.soulwire.co.uk/laboratory/flash/as3-bitmapdata-glitch-generator) (.swf) and I'll quote this part:

&gt;The small gottcha is that it isn’t desirable to mess with the JPEG headers, so when the clean ByteArray is passed to the Glitchmap class, it will determine the length of the header by reading through the bytes until it finds the SOS (start of scan) declaration (0xFFDA). The next two bytes represent the length of the SOS, so it skips forward by this amount – the resulting position in the ByteArray should be the end of the header, and so between this point and the EOI (end of image) the data corruption takes place.

my question is: how can one do this in bash? I have no idea.

I think the desired output would be two files: one for the header, the other for the rest of the image; in some way that it would be possible to:

    cat imgheader imgbody &gt; img.jpg

just like command 'split' behavior.

is it possible?

I hope I choose good subreddit. ;-)

I've bought 1TB external HDD and I want to sync some of my directories (like Work and Documents). The point is I am working on few computers (home, lab, classes) and I want to have the most current data. So I want to synchronize all my home folders using this external HDD. Let's say that I am working on report, I'm saving it on my laptop. Then before finishing work I am synchronizing Documents folder with external drive. I am going to lab, I am connecting my external drive to PC, synchronizing so I will have current version of my report on my lab PC. Then I am updating it, saving on PC, sync on external HDD, and going back to home to sync it with my laptop data. Of course I want to sync each time all of folders, which I will choose.

I know maybe it would be better idea to have home directory on my external HDD, but I want this drive to act as backup too.

Is rsync the app I am looking for? I know I could do standard backup using this tool, but what about sync in both ways? There are plenty tutorials how to set automated backup in rsync, but I just want to make it work from bash script.

Which filesystem should I use? I think that NTFS is not a good decision, but I was thinking about creating two partitions - One in reiserfs for backup (mounted only by bash script, however it could be nice to have acces to these data) and second one in NTFS which will allow to exchange some data between computers with different operating systems.

Thanks in advance for help! ;-)

I have a program which, when debugging, dumps gigabytes of logging info to a file or standard out.  Eventually the program will either crash or stall infinitely (stops producing output).  I normally just need the last few megabytes of this log to analyze the problem.  Right now my debug process is basically to turn only some debugging info (this is still gigabytes), analyze a bit, and re-run with more debugging info turned on closer to the stall/crash point.

Is there an easy way, via the commandline, to make a fixed size buffer which holds only the last few MB of data written to it?  Ideally this would be redirect-able like a file.  I figure this way I could just turn on all debugging info and it would mainly stick in a cached buffer.  I've found a few other posts where people are looking for similar functionality, but haven't really found an answer.

What language is closest to shell ?",roger1981,9,2,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/17mmbt/i_need_to_move_large_shellscripts_to_a_real_prog/,"TLDR: my shell scripts grow into large apps. What language is closest to shell that i can move up to?

I've been developing some CL apps in shell. Latest one (as usual) started small and kept expanding. It has a lot to do with files and directories so developing in zsh made a lot of sense due to its powerful filename globbing.  

Some of the issues that bit me the most probably could have benefited from a ""real"" programming language such as:   
   - datastructures: cannot have an array inside an array or hash  
   - passing around of arrays around the system  
 - occasionally accidental conversion of array to string etc  
   - variables are global by default unless declared local  
   - constantly hit by a space in a filename or directory name (esp when passing and changing
     arrays containing filenames)  -- the prescribed method is quite painful to adhere to  
   - calling methods in a pipeline create a new process so structures created in those
     methods don't persist (one can forget this at times, and the flow has to be rewritten at times).

So, although in some ways writing code can be easy, however there are often surprises/gotchas.  

I'd like to know what programming language is closest to shell (bash/zsh). Is it one of perl/python/ruby or is there something else out there that would be faster while giving easy access to external commands, command chaining, stdout and stderr, with of course proper datastructures and string manipulation using regexes (pref pcre), getting a single character from system with timeout.",,False,self,t5_2s4oq,False,,,True,t3_17mmbt,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/17mmbt/i_need_to_move_large_shellscripts_to_a_real_prog/,

Notice that the prompt and text you type in are still visible, as well as the output from cat (just the text you typed in) exactly like when using the shell.  What I want is just the output, nothing else, so the result, after typing foo\nbar\nbaz\nqux would be

`unhelpfulname=66,65,64`

and I want to output it like this:

`66	65	64	$randomword`

Those are `\t` tab delimiters. 

So I've gotten to the point where I can output in that format, the only problem is it only generates one random word and uses that for all the entires. 

`sed 's/\[.*\]//' file1 |  sed 's/^Name=.*//'  | sed 's/^[A-Z a-z=]*//' | sed '/^$/d' | awk 'BEGIN{""shuf -n1 /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small"" | getline tmpline} {print $0 ""\t"" tmpline} ' | sed -e 's/[,]/\t/g'; `

To explain, there are some bracketed headers in the original file that are removed. Then there are lines with no colors but other text to be removed. Then the unhelpful names are taken out. Then the empty lines are removed. Then I attempt to put a random word at the end of each line with `awk`. Finally replace the comma delimeters with tabs.

Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? I'd be happy to post the file on pastebin if you want to look at it.

Also, I dont know how to do this in windows.

I'm a beginner at this sort of thing, so kindly bear with my noob-ness.

* 1. Drive is inserted
* 2. A script runs to authenticate user, saves details in a file
* 3. Run script to give details in file to share server
* 4. Download data

This is just a small proof of concept demo, to be run on an internal network. So, security is not a big concern. It can be added later on, after the software works properly.

I am in the middle of a project with a few other guys to create a magazine about the command line and distribute it for free online. Two writers are still with me, but I'm afraid it doesn't look like this magazine will happen unless we get more writers, as 3/5 of the writers have missed two deadlines and have stopped responding to my messages.

The magazine would cover command line tips and tricks, app roundups, app reviews, primers on basic CLI topics, how to be a better shell scripter, etc. It is aimed at beginners to high-intermediate users (maybe experts too).

We need:

- A web programmer and designer who can create a website for the magazine. Doesn't have to be flashy (remember, it would be ironic if the website is unable to be viewed on the command line)

- Writers who can write about command line topics.

I've created ISO images of all of the DVDs I own, so I can watch them whenever I want without having to hunt down the disc. I've recently come into possession of a Roku box, which can stream local media converted to H.264. Instead of converting every single movie by hand, I want a single command (or bash script) that will do this for me automatically for every ISO file in a particular directory.

The directory structure looks something like the following:

    /$title/Widescreen or Fullscreen/Original Release or Special Edition or Extended Version, etc/$title.iso

or, to give an example
    
    /Movies/DVD Images/No sorting/Boondock Saints, The/Unrated Special Edition/Widescreen/Original/Boondock Saints (Unrated Special Edition Original Widescreen).iso

The script would have to traverse subdirectories, looking for anything ending in .iso, run handbrake with a bunch of predefined arguments, and put the resulting .m4v file into /Converted/$title, where $title is grabbed from path to the .iso that is being converted.

Could someone give me some help or somewhere to start on how to do this?

If I could pick your brains once again..

So when passing commands via SSH, you will of course use the format of ssh user@boxname 'command'.

This is fine up until you start using commands that require quotes - for example

    # ssh root@boxname 'w | awk '{ print $1 }''
    awk: cmd. line:1: {
    awk: cmd. line:1:  ^ unexpected newline or end of string

If you attempt to simply escape the quotes, you get:

    # ssh vivien 'w | awk \'{ print $1 }\''
    &gt; 

I'm aware I could just parse the data locally (i.e; ssh user@boxname 'w' | awk '{ print $1 }') or write it to a file, upload, run and remove - but I want to work out exactly what's happening here.

I know I can also use double quotes for the SSH command, but this gives unpredictable results.

You want to label the two inputs or else the output will return the file devices

     Files /dev/fd/63 and /dev/fd/62 differ    # without labels
     Files Left and Right differ                     # with labels

Surely, you can write a shell script that can mainpulate the names of the left and right file names using the `--label` arguments.

For example, I wanted to see if there really was a difference between two JSON queries in the Google Maps API.

     diff -q -s &lt;(wget -q -O- ""https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=38.63,-90.20&amp;sensor=false"") --label ""Left"" &lt;(wget -q -O- ""https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=38.63,-90.20&amp;components=address_components:postal_code&amp;sensor=false"") --label ""Right""

Obviously, I wanted to see if it was worth adding the `components` argument.  It turns out for what I wanted to do, it mattered not.

     Files Left and Right are identical

So that is my helpful tip.  Now for the second part.

Currently, what I would really like to do modify how diff's side-by-side mode appears (`diff -y $1 $2`).

I know when displaying binary data in a terminal, it is not uncommon to end up with a garbled terminal due to some sequences being mostly-valid ANSI escape sequences, but I have noticed that I also sometimes end of with text being inputted into my prompt which also seems like a security issue to me. Here's an example where I ran the `file` command on an excel file with the wrong flag (I intended to display the mime type which is actually `-i`):

    [~/desktop]$ file -m quarterly-report.xlsx 
    ...
    ... Tons of binary giberish was spewed here ...
    ...
    quarterly-report.xlsx, 300: Warning: type `qN�' invalid

If it matters, I'm using GNU screen inside of xterm.

[This](http://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=4385) may be helpful. 

I know this is asking quite a bit but I don't just want a script for the conversion. I also want to study it and be able to learn from it too expanding on whatever help can be offered.

Thanks!

Nothing seems to work at the moment. Here is the problem, because I probably can't describe any better - 

Write a shell script called make_uid which creates user login names given a file containing the user's full name.  Your script needs to read the newusers file, and for each name in the file create a login name which consists of the first character of the users first name, and up to 7 characters of their last name.  If the last name is less than seven characters, use the entire last name.  If the user only has one name, use whatever is provided as a name (in the newusers file) to generate an 8 character long login name.
Note: login names need to be all lower case!

Once you have created a login name, you need to check the passwd file to make sure that the login name which you just created does not exist.  If the name exists, chop off the last character of the name that you created, and add a digit (starting at 1) and check the passwd file again. Repeat this process until you create a unique user login name.  Once you have a unique user name, append it to the passwd file, and continue processing the newusers file.

Currently trying to use a while loop to read through the newusers file and using cut to try and make the ids. going...poorly. Any advice, input, help you be appreciated, thanks!

So what started as some simple spamassassin rule writing has led me into the dark realms of regular expressions.

I decided to try and pull the subject lines out of a log, where the column differs each time and so is proving quite a bit harder than it would otherwise.  It is however, the only bit of the line in double quotes ""like so"" so I went with trying to pull out any text between double quotes.

I managed to find the following regex online, but am at a loss of how exactly it works - despite spending the last 4 hours digging through innumerable awk/sed/regex guides.

    sed 's/.*""\(.*\)""[^""]*$/\1/'

The bits I have figured out the intent of:

    .* = anything
    ""\(.*\)"" = match 'anything' in quotes and remember pattern
    [^""] = don't match quotes (inside the quotes only??  Not sure)
    *$ = anything up to end of line?
    \1 = output pattern from ""\(.*\)""

I don't understand 'how' it's working, even if I can piece together the general gist of what it's doing.

Would anyone be able to offer some insight on it?  A better way would also be welcome, although I'm still v interested to figure out how ^^ works.",,False,self,t5_2s4oq,False,,,True,t3_n169g,http://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/n169g/help_with_regex_please/,

So in the above example. I'd end up with an array containing (""pts/21"")

Then for each element in this array, I'd want to do `ps -aux | grep $element` and then parse that output similarly to get the PID of my sshd session, so I can `kill` it.

If there's a better approach, I'd love to hear it, but I'd like to see how I can do this with `awk` anyway, because no doubt it'll be useful in the future.

&gt; things, I am trying to prevent more damage if it happens again.

This user has a script that runs a simulation that generates tons of data.  This script also iterates the simulation call over a long list of possible inputs, running the simulation many times.  The user has some basic experience with shell scripting, enough to recognize conditions and loops and understand them.  (Enough to have run into the 'Why do variables set inside while loops not stay persistent?' problem.)

A note about my solution: There may be cooler or more elegant solutions, but I am assuming standard bash and standard commands that I know to be available on (dad-burn nearly) every Linux-based machine on our campus.  With a little tweaking, it should work on other Unix-based systems as well.

Here's my response:

Sure it is!

It's possible to figure out the remaining drive space with just a few
creative commands:

Here's the output of 'df -k' on &lt;hostname&gt; right now:

    $ df -k
    Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1            714893864 270782880 407796412  40% /

    none                   3058744       304   3058440   1% /var/run
    none                   3058744         0   3058744   0% /var/lock
    /dev/sdb1            961432072 602956476 309637596  67% /export/b
    /dev/sdc1            961432072 598710816 313883256  66% /export/c
    /dev/sdd1            961432072 890776364  21817708  98% /export/a
    /dev/sde1            961432072    204436 912389636   1% /export/d

I see that /export/a is 98% full.  The directory /data/&lt;user&gt;/ is on
/export/a, so if /data/&lt;user&gt;/ is the directory that you're writing to,
then I can extract that information in a script thusly:

    # Let's say that your script is writing data to /data/&lt;user&gt;/somedir/...
    dir_to_watch=""/data/&lt;user&gt;/somedir""
    # Retrieve the used drive space as a percentage
    percent_full=$(\
        /bin/df -P -k ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
        | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
        | /usr/bin/awk '{print $5}' \
        | /bin/sed 's,%,,g' \
        )

percent_full will be a numerical value between 1 and 100.  (Yes, I know, technically 100% isn't true, since the OS reserves some extra space for itself that users aren't allowed to have.  You know what I mean.)

Or, if you want to know how many MB of space are left on the drive, you
can do this:

    # How many MB of space is left?
    # You can just as easily replace --block-size=1M with 1K,
    # 1G, 1T, 1P, 1E, 1Z, or 1Y for different block sizes.  But
    # these are 1T drives -- good luck writing 1Y of data to them.
    space_left=$(\
        /bin/df -P --block-size=1M ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
        | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
        | /usr/bin/awk '{print $4}' \
        )

This will return the amount of free space in MB.  Then you can do a
comparison in your script to decide whether or not you have enough space
to proceed:

    # If disk is 98% full or greater
    if [ ""${percent_full}"" -ge 98 ]; then
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed""
        exit 1
    fi

or

    # If disk has less than 10MB of space left
    if [ ""${space_left}"" -lt 10 ]; then
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed""
        exit 1
    fi

Of if you really want to get jiggy with it, you could just have the
script print a warning and wait for space to clear up before proceeding:

    while [ ""${percent_full}"" -ge 98 ]; do
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed, waiting for more space to become available""
        # Wait 5 minutes
        sleep 300
        # Check disk space again
        percent_full=$(\
            /bin/df -P -k ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
            | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
            | /usr/bin/awk '{print $5}' \
            | /bin/sed 's,%,,g' \
            )
    done

or

    while [ ""${space_left}"" -lt 10 ]; do
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed, waiting for more space to become available""
        # Wait 5 minutes
        sleep 300
        # Check disk space again
        space_left=$(\
            /bin/df -P --block-size=1M ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
            | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
            | /usr/bin/awk '{print $4}' \
            )
    done

If your run returns a non-zero exit status on failure, then you can
check after a run to see if a full drive is the culprit:

    if ! &lt;command-to-run&gt;; then
        echo ""Command &lt;command-to-run&gt; failed""
        echo ""Checking for drive overflow error...""
        percent_full=$(\
            /bin/df -P -k ""${dir_to_watch}"" \
            | /usr/bin/tail -1 \
            | /usr/bin/awk '{print $5}' \
            | /bin/sed 's,%,,g' \
            )

            # perhaps do something ingenious here
        fi
        exit 1
    fi

And you can have your script send you an email like this:

    # If disk is 98% full or greater
    if [ ""${percent_full}"" -ge 98 ]; then
        echo ""Not enough space to proceed""
        # Send an email:
        /usr/bin/mail &lt;user&gt;@&lt;domain&gt; -s ""DISK FULL"" &lt;&lt;EOF
    The disk containing ${dir_to_watch} is ${percent_full}.
    Please clean this up a.s.a.p.
    EOF
        # Die gracefully after living a good, full(-disk) life:
        exit 1
    fi

Variations on the above solutions also apply.  :)

I cant figure out how to take a nuneric result from a command and do an integer compare for conditional execution. It is as if the comparison is using the exit code of execution or something, and not the integer.

My base list (or series of pipe-separated commands) is:

df -kh | grep ""/u02"" | awk '{printf $(NF-1)+0}'

Basically I am checking space on the /u02 volume and using awk to snag the value in the nexto to last column, as a value, with no newline. And that works at the commandline. But in my script, it isnt.

In my script I want to do: if df -kh etc etc &lt; 10; then ....

But of course, the script is trying to open or execute ""10"" because the &lt; is redirection. Is there a way to snag and compare my result (25, in this case) with 10 or another integer?

The example input log is a pipe delimited file that looks like this:
`[root@mgmt02 allerrors]# head -1 allerrors.06.16.13.log
06/16/13|00:00:21.893|0|NULL|get_file_size Failed to get ready asset with data_id 105422013`

The fields are ""date|time|stringID|contextID|log message""

So, let's say I wanted to get a breakdown of all of the stringIDs in this log. If it were me, I'd do (I know there are dozens of ways to do this, but this is where mind goes first):

    [root@mgmt02 allerrors]#  awk -F\| '{print $3}' allerrors.06.16.13.log |sort|uniq -c | head -6
       2087 0
         80 10002

        350 17013
         32 17014
        169 17023

 * Split each line based on `|` as the delimiter 
 * Sort the results
 * use `uniq -c` to get a count of each result

But the guy I work with does it like this:

    [root@mgmt02 allerrors]# awk -F\| '{a[$3] += 1}END {for (i in a)print i,a[i]}' allerrors.06.16.13.log |head -6

    17013 350
    33048 898
    17031 841

From what I know about awk, and just piecing it together, I understand that 
 * He's splitting the file based on `|` as the delimiter.
 * creating an array called `a` (this seems more like a dictionary, but I don't know awk that well)
 * If the value of the 3^rd column is already in the array, add one to a counter for that value in the array. 
 * this is where I'm kind of lost. I get what everything after the END is doing...but I'm not quite sure. I'm sure it's quite simple, and I could probably add this to my toolbelt as is as a way to get things done, but I'd like to understand it a bit more.

I have a small thing to generate Excel-friendly output from custom log (created by another script).
I know that it looks awful, but it does what it is supposed to (except of that single thing) and is used only once a month. I would really appreciate your help.
  
So here it is:  

Script generates log formatted like this:  
    Sat, 01-09-2012 18:22:04 CEST | packet loss: server1  
    Sat, 01-09-2012 18:22:06 CEST | packet loss: server2  
    Sat, 01-09-2012 18:22:09 CEST | packet loss: server3  
    Sat, 01-09-2012 18:22:14 CEST | packet loss: server4  
    Sat, 01-09-2012 18:23:04 CEST | packet loss: server1  
    Sat, 01-09-2012 18:23:06 CEST | packet loss: server2  
    Sat, 01-09-2012 18:23:09 CEST | packet loss: server3  
    Sat, 01-09-2012 18:23:14 CEST | packet loss: server4  
So: Weekday, date, HH:MM:SS tz | whatever
  
What I need to be generated from this log is: 'number_of_minutes date' or 'number_of_minutes;date' so it can be pasted to Excel to generate graphs.
I'm using (I know, it's nasty) something like this:  
    *grep \\\\-09-2012 /var/log/ping.log|awk '{print $2 ""\t"" $3 ""\t"" $8}'|awk -F: '{print $1 "":"" $2 "" "" $4}'|uniq|awk '{print $1}'|uniq -c|awk '{print $1 "";"" $2}'*  
  
- grep all September 2012 lines from /var/log/ping.log
- grep date, time and server name
- grep date and time formatted in HH:MM (cut out server name, and seconds)
- cut out similar entries with uniq (I am only interested in number of minutes per day)
- get only dates
- get number of entries for each day
- add tabulators or semicolons for Excel/OpenOffice/LibreOffice-friendly output

I know, that three first steps can be simplified but it's used for one more thing, so it's like that ;)

And here's the tricky part:
If link was working correctly, there are no 'empty' days, which I need formatted like ""0;date"" or ""0 date"". I can't think of a way to insert them...  
What I have is eg.:  
1;10-09-2012  
6;11-09-2012  
238;14-09-2012  
1;17-09-2012  
where 12-09-2012, 13-09-2012, 15-09-2012 and 16-09-2012 are missing between first and last entry.  

**Any idea how to add missing days in proper places here?** Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

In other words the foo fields will always have the same variable name but the will hold its descriptive info from its respective Var. e.g  if Var5 returns set foo1-10 to $foovar1 - 10 from Var5's row.

Since I first wrote this I've seen a few other solutions for dealing with the issue of managing/creating symlinks for configs in dotfile repos to their native locations in ~/. I've seen Makefile solutions, Rakefiles, shell scripts containing a sequence of 'ln -s's , and some setups where the .git folder is right under ~/ with '*' in .gitignore (which just seems really messy to me - and I recall reading this could be dangerous with some git commands). None of them seemed to have all the features I needed so I decided to write my own solution.

I should explain beforehand, I wrote my own basic implementation of a map since associative arrays weren't introduced until bash 4.0 and I needed the script to work with bash 3.2.29+ (some of the machines I work with are still running Debian Lenny (old stable)).

For those interested, I'll show what some possible use cases might look like:

    # initial setup of a new machine or temporarily working on another machine
    $ git clone git://host.com/user/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles; cd $_
    $ git submodule update --init       # the script can be added as a submodule to the dotfile repo
    $ cd link.sh
    $ ./link.sh                         # output a table showing current status of the managed dotfiles
    $ ./link.sh -b                      # backup any existing conflicting files (for when you're temporarily on a machine)
    $ ./link.sh -wf                     # link your dotfiles (-f to overwrite any existing ones)
                                        # any parent directories for the destination path will be created

    # optionally: once you're finished working on a temporary machine
    $ ./link.sh -r                      # restore environment to original state
                                        # any created parent directories will be removed (only if empty)

Another case: a file in your repo might contain sensitive info (e.g.: ~/.ssh/config with host aliases)

    $ link.sh -c ssh/config             # create local copy of file 'ssh/config' in your repo
                                        # commands can take multiple keys as args (none implies all keys defined in config)
    $ vim ~/.ssh/config                 # add sensitive info
    $ &lt;change made to ~/dotfiles/ssh/config&gt;
    $ link.sh -v ssh/config             # view diff of local copy and repo version with vimdiff
                                        # copy over any new settings using 'do' vim command

This would allow you to keep your ~/.ssh/config in your dotfile repo while any sensitive parts of it remain on the local machine.

The script works by reading the source and destination paths from a config file, [as shown here](https://github.com/acx0/link.sh#setup), so there's no imposed structured on your dotfile repo. Any parent directories in the destination path will be created when symlinking or copying, and removed when deleting or restoring (although there are some [limitations](https://github.com/acx0/link.sh/blob/0e649679155737f90f1619aefb1d24fc9012a5e0/link.sh#L131)). As shown, all flags except -v and -u can take multiple args (keys in your config file), or none, meaning process all defined keys.

Anyway, I thought I should probably clean up the script a bit since I haven't bothered optimizing or refactoring much of it since I wrote it. Any suggestions are welcome, whether it's about functionality or coding conventions.

Here are a few things I'll probably be changing soon:

* make output much less verbose - I've left it on by default for debugging, but should probably make it optional now
* make colour output optional in config file
* make `    ~/.link.conf` the default config location rather than the hardcoded `    ~/etc/.link.conf`
* cleanup variable scope - I believe bash variables are defined globally by default?
* add variable for the diff tool to use, rather than hardcoded `    vimdiff`
* clarify in documentation that parent directory path creation/deletion will be handled by script
* ~~add support for paths with whitespace~~ - as suggested by Rhomboid - TODO: fix `    read_opt_args()` so that it preserves quotes when reading args into array (e.g: `    link.sh -w ""some key"" vimrc` parses the keys as being { ""some"", ""key"", ""vimrc"" } instead of { ""some key"", ""vimrc"" }; any ideas?

Any suggestions are welcome.

Also, if anyone's interested, I can add instructions to the documentation for installing the script as a git submodule.

First post here. Here's the deal: I wrote some code to do what I have described in the title. Motivation: I'm from Brazil (so forgive my writing) and we used to have a blog with a huge collection of academic ebooks. The Brazilian Association of Reprographic Rights (ABDR) shut it down today. I'm not related to the owner or anyone (the guy is being sued, as far as I know). I'm just trying to save the links (hosted in many mediashare-like sites) because it helped me and many THOUSANDS of students and professors over the country (really!).

Ok.

I wrote some code to get all the tweets (couldn't find another index) with the permalinks of the blog, resolved it (twitter t.co links got me some trouble) and end up with this list of about 1200 post links. All links are dead now, as I told you. So I did this:

    j=1
    for i in $(cat livros.txt) ; do
    	url=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:$i&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;strip=1""
    	echo ""#$j: extraindo links de google-cache:$i""
    	download=$(lynx -useragent=""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; rv:9.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/9.0.1"" --dump $url | awk '/http/{print $2}' | grep -v livrosdehumanas.org | grep -v twitter | grep -v tweetdeck | grep -v google.com | grep -v 30porcento | grep -v wordpress | grep -v cryoutcreations | grep http)
    	echo ""&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; $download""
    	echo -e ""##### $i\n$download\n"" &gt;&gt; links-downloads.txt
    	let j++
    	echo ""waiting not to flood google...""
    	sleep 10
    done

I know it's kinda lame, but works. The output is something [like this](http://pastebin.com/YTk6ADpm). My problem is I can get, at most, 100 download links before google blocks my IP over the flood of requests. Some times, less then 50. This implies restarting my modem (lame again, I know) too many times and waiting for ages to dump all the content. Maybe the google cache for this pages won't last long, since the blog was shut down (and the wayback machine hasn't got it).

So, I need some help: is there a better way of doing this? how? (if not, could anybody help running this thing? I can share a list with 100 or so links to run with this script; I don't know...)

I have a sizable music folder backed up to a couple of external drives (for the purposes of this post, assume it's just a single folder, on an auto-mounted drive).

I want to keep a file with a list of the current contents of the folder (no recursion required, I just want the directories).

I tried a simple

    ls music &gt; listing.txt

with one problem -- if the drive isn't mounted at start, fails, or empties for some reason, as does my list of contents. 

I messed around with comparing the `ls music` with the currently saved `listing.txt` contents, but I ran into issues regarding the sorting, &amp;c.

Basically, I'm trying to write a command which:

1. reads the contents of `.../music`.
2. compare the lines to those of `.../listing.txt`.
3. if there are any ('new') entries (directories) in the folder which don't feature in the listing file, add those entries into the text file.

I don't really mind how the `listing.txt` file is structured, but I'd prefer it ordered with newest additions first. *i.e.*, a crude time-created-descending, but basically just adding new lines from the top first.

Im trying to run this amazing software [Dashing](https://github.com/Shopify/dashing) on my debian server. I found [this](https://rarforge.com/w/index.php/Dashing_-_dashboard_framework) guide for how to install and run it on debian squeeze. 

But there is one thing in the guide Im not quite sure of. 
&gt;remeber the script before -- we need to link the new installed gem dashing into /usr/bin/ 

And here is the script:

    for f in /var/lib/gems/1.9.1/bin/*
    do
    filename=$(basename $f);
    if [ -e $filename ]
    then echo ""$filename already exits"";
    else sudo ln -s $f $filename;
    fi
    done

How do I run this scipt correctly? Cause I have been pasting the script straight in the terminal and that sort of gave me the correct output, but the dashing command still does not work. ""dashing - no such command""

So that's why I wonder if I'm running the script the correct way.

and command2's output will be refreshed every Y seconds.

is that possible with watch or in some other way?

(btw, my end goal is to run a specific heavy resource consuming binary, and display its output every 60 seconds

while attached to the bottom of its output - is a live rotating log every 0 seconds

so far i use 

*watch 'mybinary ; tail -40 /var/log/syslog.log'*

but this runs both ""mybinary"" and tail on syslog - every 2 seconds

since ""mybinary"" is heavy duty, i only want it to refresh every 60 seconds, but keep the log refreshing every 2 seconds or less)

 *  ideally, the text editor can be externally scripted (i.e. it can be controlled by tmux), similarly to how tmux itself can be controlled by an external script

To expand on the first point: a problem with tabbed browsing, tabbed terminals, tabbed text editors etc, is that you often can't switch directly e.g. from editing a specific file to running a command in a specific terminal: you must switch from your text editor window to your terminal window, and then switch to the specific tab of interest within that terminal window. I find this two-level switching doesn't fit within my muscle memory and can break my flow, so I wish to avoid it.

Here are some text editors I've considered:

 *  **nano**
     *  can only edit a single file at a time --- which is good! (I'd run another copy of nano for each file I wanted to edit)
     *  there doesn't seem to be a way to cut+copy+paste between those different copies of nano, whether using the tmux paste buffer or otherwise

 *  **emacs**
     *  wants to display everything in the same terminal
     *  there is emacsclient (for using an extra terminal), but I fear it would be too easy to type Ctrl+X Ctrl+B, or Ctrl+X Ctrl+F, and I'm back to the two-level switching problem
     *  I could try to avoid that by rebinding all the keys... but inevitably I'll miss something, my emacs muscle memory from years back will betray me, and I'd be fighting against the emacs grain anyway

 *  **vim**
     *  scares me
     *  wants to display everything in the same terminal

    find -mtime +21 -regex '.*txt_[0-9][0-9].*'

That would work if my months were done as double digits (01, 02, 03), but they're not, so it only pulls months 10, 11, and 12. I have the same issue with the days, they're done in both single and double digits. 

What can I modify to make it search correctly, or is there a better way I could be doing this?
