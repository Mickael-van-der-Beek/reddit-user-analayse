1375051283.0,296,self.whatisthisthing,1j8n8e,/r/whatisthisthing should have its own cold case subreddit to encourage hardcore solvers.,chewitt,375,79,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/1j8n8e/rwhatisthisthing_should_have_its_own_cold_case/,"Take an obscure object that was posted 3 days ago and, while getting lots of upvotes, remains unsolved. Three things happen:

* The post, being so old, will no longer appear on your front page. It fades out of your mind.

* If it eventually does get solved, only the OP and the most diligent readers will likely see the solution.

* There is little motivation to solve it, because you know there are few people that will see your answer (or upvote it).

I propose a cold case subreddit similar to /r/TOMTcoldcase to address these issues. Any unsolved post over a certain karma threshold would be automatically posted to the cold case subreddit when it reaches a certain age. Cold case subscribers will now see it on their frontpage. Maybe the most hardcore dedicated solvers are ONLY subscribed to the cold case sub, because they're waiting for a real challenge.

If an object makes it to the cold case guys and goes for a certain number of weeks with STILL no solution, it becomes a Relic. (or whatever) Anyone who solves a Relic object will get a post in the original /r/whatisthisthing like ""Relic SOLVED after 3 months 12 days: ""Found this thing in my grandparent's barn..."""" to reward the cold case solver with sweet sweet karma, and give /r/whatisthisthing the closure it deserves.

So, what do you think?

**EDIT:**

Based on the positive feedback, we'll be going ahead with this idea. It will take some time to figure out the best system for posting, but feel free to stop on by!

I went fishing on a party boat, ""The Gambler"" out of Point Pleasant Beach New Jersey. We fished in the ocean, at a distance varying from 1 mile to 2 miles off the shore. We spent majority of the day in between the Manasquan Inlet and Bridge Ave. 

We all saw a massive white cube floating on the horizon. It appeared to be bigger than any other vessel on the horizon (cargo ships). At first I thought that it was a cargo ship coming directly towards us at a very very far distance and it only looked like a cube because of the angle we were viewing it at... but we saw it from multiple angles and it was a cube or box of shape of some sort. As mentioned this thing appeared to be larger than ANYTHING on the horizon and it actually disappeared at one point... not sure where it could have went so quickly. 

The crew consisted of 5 guys that have been on the boat for 5-6 days a week for years.. fishing in the same spots we were in, if not further out for tuna/shark. They said that they have only seen it once, earlier in the summer. **They said that they saw it a little closer said that it's almost like a floating airplane or blimp hangar and there is actually no ""deck"" or outside surface to the vessel and it's literally just a floating box**.

If you are the submitter, when you look at your post in the list or comments page, you'll see an item that says ""Is This Solved?"".  

When you click on it you'll see something like [**this**.](http://i.imgur.com/rbmaE.png)

**Note**: If you have ""Use subreddit style"" disabled you will not see this menu or the coloring, but instead you'll see an item called ""flair"".  Click that, same thing.

The options are:

* **Solved** - Case is definitely solved
* **Likely Solved** - Looks good, probably correct, close enough for government work
* **Still Open** - Not solved.  Choose this if it was put in another state incorrectly or if you want to draw a little more attention to a recent post that hasn't been answered.
* **Closed** - Mostly administrative.  If the image link is dead, or the answer was found elsewhere and not linked, etc
* **Cold Case** - Again, administrative.  I used this to bring old cases into the cold case list, and may go back into the archives and keep digging them up.  But if you have an old case you want to bring into the cold case list, feel free.

Select one of the options, and hit save.  That's it.  Only the submitter and the mods can set these states.

If you're the submitter and a mod sets the solved state to something you disagree with, feel free to change it.

I would expect most submitters would only need to use ""Solved"".  I may use ""Likely Solved"" if I think it is correct but the submitter is unresponsive.

1349743036.0,132,self.whatisthisthing,11636m,Tips for a successful ID of your item,spasticpoodle,152,20,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/11636m/tips_for_a_successful_id_of_your_item/,"I have been active in this subreddit for a little while now, and I have noticed a few things that can be done by the posters, and the identifiers to help accurately ID items more reliably.

**For the Posters:**

1. Post clear photos. Not a photo from your camera phone, but one from a real camera, in focus, and with proper lighting.
2. Include photos of any marks, numbers, or logos. If they are difficult to read in the photo, make sure to include a transcription in your post.
3. Include a reference item with your item to give an idea of size.
4. Describe everything you can about the item. Size, weight, material it is made of can all be helpful in determining what it is. Also let us know where it was found. The city it was in, the kind of store you found it in, the kind of things it was next to, all of it can help us figure out what the item is.
4. Once the item has been identified, please tag it as such.

**For the identifiers:**

1. If you are not 100% positive about the item, don't claim that it is something. I have seen postings where 7 different people all say ""It is ____"", and what they claim it is is 7 different things. It is preferable to say ""I think it is ______"" or ""It looks like it could be_____""

2. If you know what it is, try to find a link to an identical or similar item, and provide it in your response, or at least try to provide some reason why you are right. (For instance if you are a doctor, and you know that something is a wangensteen pump from personal experience, state that.)",Meta,False,self,t5_2s3kh,False,possiblecase,,True,t3_11636m,http://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/11636m/tips_for_a_successful_id_of_your_item/,

Hello.  
  
I just went to look at the greenish (or blueish) thing on the sidewalk. There a valve for water, in the ground, next to it. So I looked for it on the Internet and the greenish thing is... an hydrant that you can use with a NFC card. [Here is a video of a similar model](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztrEroeSpTE). The exact reference seems to be ""[Moneca](http://www.talis-group.com/index.php?BAYARD_AUTOMATIC-HYDRANTS-WITH-SMART-CARD-MONECA)"".

Would appreciate an ID on this silver pocket watch handed down to me by my granddad(Japanese).

I was never very close to my grandparents, so was surprised when I was given this just prior to my granddad passing away.

What I know about it:
	1. Was told that it was awarded to him personally by Emperor Hirohito for ""academic achievement"", at graduation of high school.
	2. On the pocket watch is engraved ""賞 陸軍大臣"", which translates to ""Prize - Minister of War"". This seemingly contradicts 1.
	3. Was also told that it was the same prize which Mishima Yukio(三島由紀夫) was awarded around the same time. I happened to find this video of him mentioning that he was awarded ""a watch"" by the Emperor at 09:17. (Japanese)
	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wLaND09VF8

Googling hasn't turned up much, so any input on the value of this would be appreciated.

5/7 - Couldn't get there today. Will update with photos and info as soon as I'm able, possibly not before the end of the week. 

5/31 update: Holy shit, I'm so sorry! I have not been able to update because the owner and I haven't seen much of each other at all this month. But, I was finally able to take pictures. 

First, the bad news: 
http://i.imgur.com/3pSLS.jpg

That is a 220 volt plug. The one available and viable outlet in this guy's house is not working. So, no plugging occurred.  :( If I can, I'll just unhook the dryer or something, right?
