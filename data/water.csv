1304461037.0,25,self.water,h3i4c,"Moderator's note: on Reddit Water passing 1,000 readers (hurray!)",wainstead,27,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/water/comments/h3i4c/moderators_note_on_reddit_water_passing_1000/,"Today, Tuesday, May 3rd 2011 Reddit Water surpassed 1,000 readers!

First and foremost, I want to thank [rd4](http://www.reddit.com/user/rd4/), [VicinSea](http://www.reddit.com/user/VicinSea/) and especially [anutensil](http://www.reddit.com/user/anutensil/) for their help; rd4 created our awesome water molecule logo.

I started Reddit Water over two years ago, long before the term ""fracking"" had been coined, before National Geographic and the New York Times created special ongoing water sections ([here](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/clean_water_crisis.html) and [here](http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/w/water/index.html)), and when talking about water issues put people straight to sleep at parties. Which it still does, but one thing at a time.

So it's a small reward to reach 1,000 readers but it makes me happy; it says the work we do here matters to some people -- a small handful of water district managers, hydrogeologists, and ""blue greens,"" to name a few of the readership's occupations (that I know of).

I try to follow about [forty-eight water blogs](http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user%2F11714933878999847100%2Fbundle%2Fwater) and a dozen or so Google News Alerts, but the deluge of information is hard to keep up with. I've seen an uptick in the number of posters lately, so hopefully we're reaching a critical mass where I can relax a bit and marvel at the articles other people are finding.

Our relationship with water is a vast topic; I recently explained to one reader [why I posted an article on a fire department draining a pond to fight a rural fire](http://www.reddit.com/r/water/comments/gfr98/firefighters_use_pond_water_to_fight_house_fire/c1nm9zd?context=3):

&gt; I try to post a variety of articles; in this case, rural firefighting lacked hydrants to combat a fire.

&gt; Providing hydrants, and supplying them with water, is one of the more fringe issues. I posted an article a couple of years ago about a house in Texas that burned to the ground because there was no water being supplied to the local hydrants; the water system had been privitized, and in the contract with the city there was no requirement to supply water for fires (it was ""optional,"" iirc).

&gt; For /r/water my view is one that's kind of holistic: the ""wholeness that's way too big,"" to quote a [Minutemen song](http://lyrics.wikia.com/Gracenote:Minutemen:Political_Song_For_Michael_Jackson_To_Sing). Increasingly ""water issues"" only means ""fracking"" (and other causes célèbres) to a lot of people, but there's way more to our relationship to H2O than that.

To that last point, this past Thursday I rode with a friend around southern Indiana looking at flooded farmland, and we saw the swollen Ohio river and some roads and houses partially submerged. ""Gasland"" almost won an Oscar. Texas is burning. People are dying from poisoned groundwater in India. Technology breakthroughs happen all the time in water purification. California? I could do an entire subreddit on California water issues alone, but I leave that to Aquafornia (see our sidebar). Egypt and her neighboring nations are fighting over the Nile. Nebraska and Kansas, over the Republican River. A beached barge leaks in the Columbia River, requiring millions of federal dollars to clean it up. Billions of gallons of raw sewage flow into the Great Lakes every time there's heavy rain, while at the same time coal plants pump mercury into them, Asian carp threaten to get in, and algae blooms cause safety hazards.

This is just a small sample of ""the wholeness that's way too big."" Our relationship with water is intimate, often invisible, and increasingly imperiled. I'm still amazed every week at the variety of issues in the news.

Instead of asking her friends to take her to a bar to buy her drinks, she said, ""For my 21st, buy me a drink that matters.""

At college, she is involved in research on the water situations in developing countries and in environmental sustainability. For her birthday, she set up a page where people could donate money to finance a water drilling rig in Ethiopia. 

If possible, would you be willing to donate $1 to her project? A little support from a lot of people could make a huge difference! 100% of the money donated goes toward the project.

Here is a link to the instructions: [http://i.imgur.com/JxT59.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/JxT59.jpg)
