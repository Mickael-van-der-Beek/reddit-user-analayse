Hey there good people of Reddit. This is my project, been working on it for three years now, hoping that with your help it can reach the millions of people in the world who could use a little self built energy autonomy. Thanks.

..

The Solarflower is an open source solar energy collector which tracks the sun automatically through a simple non-electrical mechanism.

It can be made almost anywhere from common recycled and salvaged materials using basic tools and skills, is portable, has no running costs or emissions, and can produce up to kilowatts of power per device.

Depending on available resources it should take one to three unskilled people less than a week to build, and cost well under €$£ 100.

Potential examples of use could include:

~ Electrical production with simple steam turbine/piston, with waste heat going to oven or hot water system.

~ Dome oven with integrated water system for temperature regulation and hot/pasteurized water.

~ Steam distillation of water for removal of chemical, heavy metal, and biological toxins.

~ Medium to large scale food dehydration, processing, and roasting.

~ Conversion of fibrous organic waste into charcoal for energy storage and low smoke cooking, with coproduction of bio-oil and bio-gas.

~ And any other application utilizing heat.",,False,self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,True,t3_10f829,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/10f829/solarflower_an_open_source_scrap_makeable_solar/,

I collected the extra long needles that fell off of Ponderosa pine at the arboretum here a while back but finally got around to making my first basket. I used store-bought raffia for the stitching but would like to do it with some gathered natural fibers too. Sinew would be nice but I don't think I have the right lifestyle to be scavenging much of that yet. I used a very basic coil basket technique and learned a lot from doing it.

I honestly don't expect this to get much attention as it will be boring and a wall of text, but I find it therapeutic to type it out for the simple reason someone will learn about my brother. I have a hard time talking to people about personal things in real life and I just need to get it out. 

My brother was an amazing man. He was the older brother that was just better than you at everything. He was a troll before the term was created; when I was very young he was watching college football on TV and I didn't know any of the teams playing so I asked him what league it was. He told me it was the Gay Football league. For the next year or so I believed it. 

Our mother passed away in 1994 when I was 12 and he was 18. My father was not really in the picture since he was working a lot. My bro was really the father figure I looked up to. I had _so_ much respect for him, he could do no wrong and I would do anything for him. He clashed with my father around the same time and left the house to live in his car. He lived in his car out of spite and while working for a Deli. Any time I needed him he was there for me despite family issues. He's what drove me during tough life decisions as he was the ""fuck it, and fuck you"" type of guy and got shit done. For better or worse, it was his mindset. I remember some mafia type people coming to our home saying he owed them 20,000 dollars for gambling debts when he was only 16-17. Even then I knew he wasn't right for putting himself in that position, but I certainly respected that amount of balls he had at the time. 

After living in his car and friends couches for a couple years he bought a house on his own at the age of 20. He busted his ass and converted his basement into an apartment and rented it out. He worked so much and finally bought his own deli. By the time he was in his late 20's he ran and partially owned 3 Deli's. During this time I was moving up the ranks in IT, trying to achieve his stature to no avail. 

I got into legal trouble around this time and I called him asking for money, something that I thought I would never do as I grew up and was trying to be better than him. But I needed him. I told him I was fucked and needed $5,000. Without missing a beat he said to stop by his house after work and he'll have it in cash. At this point in life I knew he just had something I didn't, no matter how stubborn and motivated I was. I was defeated and proud at the same time. 

Soon after this, his pregnant, longtime girlfriend was diagnose with Melanoma cancer. It broke him. She had the baby and then started to really succumb to the disease. She started growing tumors all over her body over night. Some on her face and head, it really showed me personally how vicious cancer can be. My brother was phased by all this, especially when she said ""don't let me die"" when she gained consciousness on her death bed. Being the guy he is, he looked everywhere and wanted to fly her to mexico for some strange treatment while he was raising his new born child. She died, and he wasn't the same. 

My brother started taking and abusing pain medication after this that wasn't subscribed to him. He abused it and wasn't the same person anymore. He still managed all the things he needed to do, and worked 7 days a week while raising his child, but I could tell he wasn't the same person. He was severely depressed and didn't admit it. It was part of his ""boss"" personality. I could honestly see the pain he was going through, but he just kept on going. Some people call in sick to work because they have the option, but my brother didn't - it was his life. 

I got into a stupid argument with him some months later and I selfishly told him ""You're dead to me"", two weeks later after not speaking with him I received a phone call that he was dead. My brother, idol, and inspiration is dead and those were my last words to him. Today is the one year anniversary of his death and I thank anyone for reading this.

1295741014.0,67,self.SelfSufficiency,f79uz,I lived in a cave for over 3 straight months. AMA,brickout,86,19,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/f79uz/i_lived_in_a_cave_for_over_3_straight_months_ama/,"Howdy SelfSufficiency -

I’m new to the self-sufficiency gig, and just not too long ago discovered this awesome subreddit. Anyway, I have decided to share a small story with you and answer your questions as well as ask for any tips or constructive criticism you have for similar future endeavors.

In the fall of 2009 and the spring to early summer 2010, I lived in a cave. The longest consecutive stint was a bit over three months. I can’t tell you exactly where, but it’s in a place in the U.S. with lots of BLM (Bureau of Land Management) land, which basically means zero amenities and people are allowed to camp for extended periods of time. I found a sweet spot that was secluded, private, and had plenty of open land surrounding it. Every great once in a while somebody would wander into my camp, usually lost while looking for a nearby hiking trail. At the longest stretch, I went 14 days straight without seeing or interacting with another human being.

Now, I was not self-sufficient while in the cave. I did not live off the land. In fact, the land I was on would have been incredibly difficult to live off of, and I’m a noob. I packed in nearly everything I needed. This was more of a ‘have an ultra-alone head-space adventure’ than being a modern-day wilderness pioneer. However, I think the experience may pique the interest of some people here.

My cave was pretty modest in dimension, with enough floor space to sleep maybe 10 people, if they were fairly comfortable with each other. I built a stone wall across the front to keep weather at bay. The wall includes a bowed-out portion for a fire pit. The roof of the cave sloped up and outward, so smoke from my fires generally ventilated pretty well. There is a big ‘shelf’ of stone in the back of the cave, perfect for storing my stuff at waist-height. I could just stand straight up in the middle of the cave and I’m a bit over six feet tall. 

The cave faces due east, with a gorgeous, expansive view of part of a national park and a mountain chain of ~12,000 ft peaks about 25 miles away. The easterly exposure means I was protected from nearly all weather events and caught the first rays of sun in the morning. That was nice, especially on the multiple nights that the temperature dropped to nearly 0 F with snow on the ground. A modest fire was enough to keep the cave warm enough unless the wind was wailing from the east.

Above the cave is a mesa top that is roughly 5 acres. The mesa complex is surrounded by ~50 acres of unimpacted land. Besides a nearby hiking trail, there isn’t anything around for miles. The cave is about 4 miles from a gas station, which I went to occasionally to get drinking water as there wasn’t a dependable source near the cave. The nearest town is about a 30 minute drive away.

I packed in lots of dry food, most of which were grains and beans. I had black beans, garbanzos, corn, quinoa, lentils, couscous, and a few spices. I am a tech nerd, so I couldn’t do completely without my gadgets. I had a portable 26w solar panel and a 54whr battery to recharge all my camp batteries (i.e. for headlamps, electric lantern, mp3 player, a small portable speaker, and a cellphone for emergencies). I slept in a sleeping bag on a camp pad in the cave. I spent my days wandering the area, writing, drawing, playing a didgeridoo, playing with poi, day dreaming (LOOOTS of daydreaming), and wondering about my place in this world as well as humanity’s place in the world.

Since then, I have been living in a house in the small town 30 minutes from the cave. I have managed to collect a massive compost pile that I think now and again of hauling to the cave and dumping somewhere nearby and creating a little oasis of good soil for a small garden. But that would be altering the land in a way that may be illegal, and certainly disrespectful. I imagine I’ll donate the compost to a gardening neighbor, but it will hurt to see it go.

I want to live in the cave, or something similar, again, but for much, much longer and much closer to actually being self-sufficient. I think I’ll have to go somewhere less harsh where I can at least find a source of potable water and some local things to eat. I hope to go armed with a few very basic tools and supplies and with lots of knowledge of local flora and fauna and try to make do as well as I can.

Anyway, that’s my intro. Ask, critique, or comment away!

**EDIT:** Forgot to mention that I played around with fasting while in the cave. I fasted for a total of 15 days in a 45 day period. I did it in three 5 day fasts. It made shit really weird.

**Tl;dr: I lived in a cave for a while**

Not all is essential, but this gives a good overall representation. Note that nearly all protective gear and nearly all hand tools are considered vital.  As much as possible tools are multifunctional. Those that aren’t have no ready substitute. Tool lists don’t normally include clothing and protective gear, but it’s so important that I want to start right out with it.

(Long read inside, but help is greatly appreciated!)",obsidian468,67,7,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/o0gjd/planning_an_offgrid_home_with_two_other_friends_i/,"Basically, I'm looking to go off the grid, but because of my own nature, I'm looking to build a shining example of self-sufficiency - something I can use to educate others on how to do it better.  The problem is that I've only done internet and library research.  I need insight from those that have actually done it.

Right now, the plan is to essentially have a small scale off-grid commune with two others on about 20 acres, and develop farm land, including livestock (likely chickens, pigs, and goats), an orchard including fruit and nut trees, and farmland including various fruits and veggies or all sorts, depending on what grows best at that time of year (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries definitely included).

Here's my plan (warning, very long - edited repost from an email to one of the others I'm planning with):

Home:

What sorts of things would you and [the other participant] like to see worked into housing, amenities and infrastructure on the property?  Pretty much anything is possible, it's just a question of ingenuity and cost (and the more ingenious we are, the lower the cost).  As I mentioned in the reply I just sent you on FB, I realized right after I sent the rough floor plan to you that I had forgotten to add a cold cellar - that's a must for a project like this.  I'd likely put in the rear of the house, about 5-6 feet lower than the rest of the house (to make for a thicker roof and better insulation, not to mention keeping the ambient temperature in the room a little cooler - I'd like it to be around 55 degrees year round, with a large chest or upright freezer).

Also, I've been looking into using composting, low-flow toilets in the house.  This would require a small basement space central to the three bathrooms with about a 6' ceiling height and an entrance large enough to carry finished compost out.  It would also have to be climate controlled enough to maintain roughly 70 degrees year round for the most efficient composting.  The system that I'm looking at is a central tank system, designed to handle 6 people for daily use, and up to 9 people for weekend/vacation use (meaning that it's more than enough for day to day living, but won't be over-taxed should we entertain several guests every now and then).  It has the added benefit of turning our bodily waste into rich fertilizer for the farm.  In conjunction with a separate composting system for biodegradable garbage, we should be able to produce all of our own fertilizer.

As far as home construction, I'm thinking that a good way to add heating and cooling efficiency to the home (even above and beyond the inherent efficiency of the earth-berm construction) is to separate the home into three sections: the left living quarters, the shared area, and the right living quarters.  The primary wall between each section (which will also be structural) will be about 2 feet thick, and filled with a combination of earth, straw, and sawdust - basically scrap building materials, which provides for great efficiency.

I was also wondering if I should leave the design with two completely separate living quarters, complete with kitchens, or just do two bedrooms and living on one side, and three bedrooms with living space on the other side, and have a larger, shared kitchen.  The reason I originally broke it up into two complete separate living spaces is because of bad experiences with former roommates.  Those experiences are not likely to be true here, as we're all adults with a common goal, and know how to respect each others' things.  Besides, two kitchens will greatly reduce the efficiency of the space, particularly with propane usage in the ovens/ranges.

A possible design that could work is to reduce the size of the central great room and put a large kitchen across the rear of it (the bathrooms would have to stay more or less where they are because of the placement of the central composter).  The space gained in the living areas could be turned into storage, office space, or any of a number of other things, or simply eliminated to make the home smaller, and thus more efficient (if we eliminated the separate kitchens, the third bedroom on the right side would be moved into the space for the kitchen; on the left side, the second bedroom would be moved into the kitchen space, and the space vacated by the bedroom would be turned into a shed accessible from outside only).

Infrastructure:

The first part that I worked on planning is power generation.  I'm taking a three-pronged approach to this - solar, wind, and hydroelectric (the weighting on the overall power generation of each system would be based on the site itself - speed of flow in any stream/river on the property, average number of sunny days per year, and amount of wind and wind speed on the property above any local obstructions (trees, buildings, water towers, etc.)).

Solar power would likely be one of our primary forms of power generation, and we'd have to dedicate about 3/4 acre to it (maybe less, if efficiency tests are better than expected).  The solar system I've designed produces about 10KWh of power per day.  My current home (about 750 square feet, and drafty, poorly designed, and using highly inefficient heating/cooling - though I do use CFL lighting throughout) averages about 5KWh/day of power usage.  This 10KWh system should be more than enough to power the entire off-grid home (at about 2500-3500 square feet), even if we used conventional heating and cooling.  This can likely get scaled back.  I priced this system out at about $14,000, not including mounting or batteries.

Wind power would be mostly just a back-up system, primarily because of the costs involved with the towers.  I priced out a single DIY wind turbine system, producing 2KWh/day with a 127' tilt-up tower (meaning we can drop the tower for maintenance and for strong storms that might burn out the turbine).  Total cost, with tower, is around $16,000.  This is by far the most inefficient system, considering power produced versus installation costs.  Costs can be greatly reduced if we can reduce the height of the tower.  Over 30', the cost of the tower height roughly doubled for every ten feet.  With a 30' tower, this system could cost as little as $6,000-$7,000 per 2KWh, including the turbine.  This cost still does not include the batteries and power inverters needed to give us a steady, reliable flow of 120vAC to the house (what your standard wall outlet provides).

Hydroelectric remains the wildcard here.  Instead of pricing out systems, I've been reading up on what is required to produce hydroelectric.  If we have a good stream (or small river) on the property, with a height difference of between 10 and 40 feet from the top of the stream to the end that leaves the property, or just a fast moving stream without much height difference, we may well be able to produce a bulk of our electricity from hydroelectric.  Overall, it's fairly cheap, considering installation cost to power output, generally averaging 1-4 cents per watt hour (MUCH cheaper than grid power, which averages around 12-13 cents per watt hour.  I've seen systems that can produce up to 2KWh/day for $2000, and systems that produce as little as 300-400Wh per day for less than $750.  I'd need to see the property and any flowing surface water on it before I could provide any actual cost estimates.

Beyond the above three technologies for power generation, we would need a battery bank, a DC-AC power inverter (all of the above systems produce either 12v or 24v DC - most of the appliances and electronics we'd use in the home are going to be 120v AC - the power inverter makes using those electronics possible), and various system monitoring systems and fail-safes.  For instance, you don't want to overcharge the batteries.  One of the common fail-safes for that is a power dump, which uses the extra electricity generated over the safe levels for the batteries to do things like heat water or heat air for the home climate control.  I have not yet priced out the battery bank, but I will likely be looking into Lithium Ion batteries, as they are the most efficient, longest lasting, and have the coolest discharge rates (heat generated from battery discharge means decreased efficiency).  The battery bank will likely require a climate controlled space (hovering around 60 degrees year round). I'm guessing based on what I know about L-Ion batteries, the bank would need to be about the size of a small car to handle the kind of power we'll be generating.  The space would also need to house the various monitoring systems, disconnects, and other such power equipment.  I'd probably send power over a large, high voltage cable to the house, where it would be stepped down for home usage.  The breaker box would be located in the house. (Don't worry if you don't understand most of this.  That's why I'm here - to engineer and manage this system.  I'm the one that needs to know it.)

So basically I want to get out and live on my own. With no help from outside just me and nature.
Easy, right? NO! 

I am a 30 year old German not in the best shape of my life (as I said I am 30 :-( so go figure....). I understand that I need a lot of time in planing so I gave myself 18 Month. I can draw a Bow and I am skillful with the Knife.

In Europe there is no way of doing this without you having to pay some sort of tax or insurance. My goal is to be completely cut from society and civilization.

I don't want to use any electricity or be dependent on ""modern"" tools that once broken I could not replace.

So the Questions are:


* Where can I live without having to pay for mandatory taxes or insurances, in Germany you have to have a health insurance and pay GEZ(basically a media/TV/Internet Tax)? But since I don't plan on having an income that is no option.

* Where am I allowed to hunt or trap without having to pay fees or apply for licences? If there is no place then where is it the absolute cheapest?

* What things have I in your opinion not thought about, that most people who want to do that forget?

* Since I have German citizenship, It needs to be a place I can visit for a long time (at least one year). What places can I rule out because of this?

* What skills do I need to acquire in your opinion that are totally necessary to master **before** I begin my adventure?
  
* What tools are absolutely needed that are ""modern""? I plan on bringing a couple of Knifes with me as I could not build a good replacement myself. But other than that, I don't want to bring a whole lot with me. What would you say am I forgetting?



As you can guess I am at the very beginning of my planing. So any help is appreciated.

Site was wooded area until 10 years ago when it was cleared for the present structures.  


==========================

With all that out of the way, my initial thoughts:  


Outside - Backyard.


I plan to add a rainwater collection system. Not anything super fancy, a filter at the drain and a hose to collect the water coming off the downspout into a series of food grade barrels that will be dedicated to rainwater only.  


I have also considered harvesting water in some way that typically would run off the ledge just past the tree line. However, I don't know how best to do that.  



I will be creating an area for gardening outside the back fence that will run the length of the fence, potentially more. A portion of it initially will be a hoop or tunnel house, to allow harvest later into the year. Later, an actual greenhouse structure will be added. 
 


I feel more trees and shrubs should be planted in the backyard and likely some berry bushes of some sort. I will research more prevalent floral additions that thrive in my area. I will be planting bamboo at one corner and will harvest it at various lengths, dry it properly and use them in the garden and for fishing poles. There is a stocked pond nearby I have access to.   



We have all manner of wildlife that we frequently see, deer, turkey, fish (stocked pond) Etc. I have some neighbors that will let me barter for some of their goats and chickens.  
 


I have an order in to our local lumber yard for some cedar and will be building 3 3x3 compost heaps. There is also a large compost drum that has the handle to turn it and it's in good shape.  



There is a play structure (and the bright yellow slide is still visible in the picture) that I plan to remove and free cycle to someone or donate as it won't be useful.  



Outside - Front yard
Addition of more trees, bushes and local floral types. Removal of a handicapped ramp and construction of stairs from the removed ramp.  


I want it presentable out front but no idea in how to make that happen inside the fencing.  


There is one neighbor nearby, who wants to see the area taken care of but has mentioned help would be limited. There's also a building being used as a barn for various storage next to them.  


Inside


There is gas, electric, sewer and water. I just have to go sign all that over soon. The stove and hot water heater are propane. Inside is an electric Fridge and large chest freezer.  


How am I doing so far? I welcome any and all questions, comments and concerns.

Here are the factors to consider.,walden42,48,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/gxwvu/how_do_you_plan_a_selfsufficient_garden_here_are/,"I'd like to set up completely self-sufficient, organic, raised-bed gardening, mainly using  square foot gardening. However, I'm having difficulty figuring out what goes where and when since there are just so many factors to consider. Here is a list:

- **Crop rotation** -&gt; planting groups of different plant families together, some can't follow others
- **Plant sizes** -&gt; tall plants are to be at the North side of the garden not to shade others
- **Companion planting** -&gt; plants can be grown together to aid each other, i.e. the three sisters
- **Timing** -&gt; Different plants grow in different seasons
- **Saving seed** -&gt; different varieties of the same plant can't be grown together due to cross-pollination

Keeping all these things in mind, how would you plan a garden, year after year?

Here are some questions whose answers would greatly help me, and others, out:

1. When a spring crop, such as spinach, is done, do you plant something from a different plant family for the summer crop? Does that already count as crop rotation? When does the ground need its rest?
2. If I plant seeds that are only heirloom (""proven through the decades...""), is there absolutely no risk of cross-pollination, even if different types of tomatos are right next to each other? If I plant regular open-pollinated seeds, how far apart should different types be?
3. In certain types of companion plantings, such as the three sisters mentioned above, pole beans fix nitrogen into the soil that the corn gobbles up. Would this garden plot still need to be rotated every year?

General advice on all this would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",,False,self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,True,t3_gxwvu,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/gxwvu/how_do_you_plan_a_selfsufficient_garden_here_are/,

Below you can find a copy of my post from the Intentional Communities REACHbook. Please comment, e-mail me, or visit the website if you're interested at all in the project or just want to help us out. Thanks. :)

Community One will be a commune with goals including:

a) complete self-sufficiency: the ability to exist independently from all other society by producing all of its requirements (e.g. food);
b) complete 'second-generation' self-sufficiency: the ability to produce all of the goods a new commune would need to form. E.g., if we decide that an axe is essential for building Community One, then at some point Community One must be able to manufacture such axes.

The desire for One and the reasons for these goals stem from my essay on political philosophy, ""On societies and their rights"", available at http://www.mediafire.com/?e4pbyepla6zb187 . Essentially I want to form Community One because:

* I am becoming distressed with life in the 'society at large', and no longer wish to deal with money, governments, or corporations. I desire a simpler life in harmony with nature and a few close friends who share a similar desire.
* I believe that all people should have the right to leave a society to go and form their own (see my essay for more information). By creating Community One we will be able to prove to others that this can be done, and obtain valuable information that will benefit others who wish to do so. We will write a book containing all of the information we will have used to create Community One, and this will be taken back to the 'old society' for the benefit of those who wish to do the same.

Please see our website or e-mail me for more information.

We make cheese and sell it to shareholders through a local co-op as well as at a farmer's market. We also have a large garden that supplies most of our fresh vegetables. There's an opportunity to volunteer at the co-op too on your days off, which can be a lot of fun.   

Some of your duties would be learning how to herd the goats out into the surrounding forested canyons and BLM land, making all kinds of yummy cheeses, and tending to the garden.  

We are all really into food here, so expect to eat awesome meals.  If you love to cook, you'll do very well here!  

There is one full-time person here, as well as two wwoofers that are here for the season (I am one of them).  We are 27 and 30 years old, and the full-time person is a super awesome 61 year old lady who works harder than all of us put together.  Someone just recently left, and we need one more person to balance out the work load.    

The requirements are 20-25 hours a week, and there is a small stipend offered.  Most of the chores are completed in the morning, and we have a huge chunk of the day to ourselves to read, write, hike, relax.  

There is wireless internet that is run off of solar panels, so you won't be completely out of touch!  You could stay in the yurt, or sleep in a tent; it's up to you!  You could even sleep outside in just your sleeping bag.   

Thanks for reading!

**UPDATE**

Thanks everyone for your interest! I am really amazed by the amount of replies and people who want to come out here! It feels good to know that there are so many people interested in this sort of lifestyle.

Fortunately, (or maybe not so fortunately for some of you) I think that we've found someone. If it ends up not working out, you can count on me trying to contact those of you who said you could volunteer this summer! I wish we could invite all of you out here, but that might get a little crazy.

I feel confident that I could build it now, but my partners in the project feel that we should start smaller, and build our way up.

I am completely on board with that, as I and the other male on the project are the ones with a construction background (I also have an architecture/science/physics/engineering/electrical background).  The two women involved have a business background and a problem management background (respectively), as well as having both grown up on farms, and knowing agriculture inside and out.

The latest suggestion was to approach the project from a profit-based business perspective, and acting as land developers.  Basically the plan was to start small, and develop up from there.

First, we'd develop a two acre property, and make it self-sufficient, sell it, and then do the same with a ten acre property, sell it, and eventually, through a process of sales, purchases, and developments, ultimately grow to a 100+ acre property, which would see the development of many other Earthship style homes, and create a complete off-grid community, such as has been developed in Taos, NM.

The home design I posted in my last post is my dream home - the ultimate goal we're working towards.  With the redirection in our immediate goals, I have a new home design (I'm glad I've designed it to be drag and drop - it took me all of ten minutes to build this design), that is very easy for new developers.

We're gonna salvage building materials and build a large community center/initial house. There will be vegetable gardens and fruit trees planted within the first couple months. After a year, I hope for me and my friend to have our own separate houses (he has a girlfriend and child). These will be small houses but will all be run on solar power, wind power, and possibly water power. We will have a well dug if possible and draw from a creek when necessary. There will be chickens, rabbits, and goats within the first year as well. After 5 years or so, we will add a large pond(if there isn't already one), and add ducks and geese, as well as cows. All of the food required for the animals will be grown on the land. There will eventually be a community bakery, carpentry shop, and blacksmith shop on the property. This is not just a dream for us, but one that we are certain will be fulfilled. The more people, the better. If you or anyone you know is interested, please contact me. We can work something out. I live in the travel trailer now so someone could stay with me until we bought the land.

I will have $225,000 in cash to start with.  I plan on maintaining some (reduced) level of income stream for at least some time after starting this.

On the land, I would like to start by building a large barn, and in a corner of that, building a small 1 bedroom apartment that uses perhaps 1/4 or less of the total barn space.  

Living in that apartment, I would then like to build my own house.

In addition, I plan on having or digging a 3 to 5 acre pond on the property, mainly for fish and the water.

I plan on raising chickens and basic vegetables immediately.

In the coming years, I would like to add other animals and plants.  I plan on composting, using cover crops to help maintain planting area fertility, and avoid any use of pesticides, etc.  

In the house, I plan on using a grey water system, composting toilet, and probably a passive solar design.  I would want to utilize wind and probably solar power as well.  

I would also capture rainwater off the roofs of the barn and house to collect in underground cisterns.

Ideally, I do not need to be on the grid, on city water, or on any city sewage.

I am still working out whether one of us would retain a full or part-time job, and whether it would ever be feasible for the farm to support itself.  So this is a major unknown at this point.

I plan on growing and preserving my own food, including both vegetables and animals.  When the fruit trees mature, it will include fruit as well.

I would like to be as self-sufficient as possible, and yes I am willing to work hard to do that.  

So reddit, any advice?  What are the books I should read?  The sites I should check out?  The lessons I should learn asap?  I would be particularly interested in anything that takes a comprehensive, top-down planning approach.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.


EDIT:  Wow, thanks to all of you for taking the time to respond-- this is so much more than I had hoped for!  I am starting to go through the links and check out recommended books, and I will certainly read them all.

(x-post from /r/sustainable_homes),thecolossusjade,48,15,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/1ie54n/building_selfsufficient_homesteads_as_a_business/,"I'm a 23 year old engineering student in the process of designing and building my first micro-homestead on a 0.7 acre property in East Texas, then helping some friends and relatives that are pursuing the same goal. I'm extremely interested in the self-sufficient lifestyle and several of us have independently decided on using the Monolithic dome as the base structure for its overwhelming resilience and energy efficiency.

My specifications for my first homestead are: 

* The house should be large enough (a 30' diameter dome, roughly 700 sq. ft.) to comfortably house one or two occupants either as a main residence, or just be a place for them to get away and relax. I want to design a compact but open living space where nothing feels cramped or short on storage space.

* It should be able to function entirely off-grid through solar panels, and possibly wind turbines, but still connect to grid power for high-energy appliances like the washing machine.

* Be able to collect, filter, and heat all the water needed for drinking, cleaning, aquaculture, and gardening by xeriscaping the property to divert rainwater through an earth-and-gravel filter into a cistern large enough to sustain the occasional East Texas drought. Drinking water can be pumped inside and purified, and another cistern for solar heating the water will be near the bathroom.

* Finally, it should be able to grow enough food to meet the occupants' nutritional needs or at least supplement their diet. The property is located within a homeowner's association where farm animals like goats and chickens are disallowed, so we'll have an aquaponic system to cultivate fish, fruit, and vegetables.

In order to save money and acquaint myself with the nuts-and-bolts of sustainable design and construction, I'll be doing most of the work myself and bringing in contractors for the stuff that absolutely has to be done right the first time. 

However, I'm still struggling with questions and considerations such as whether the project is too ""niche"" to be sellable, who I should be expecting to buy a self-sustainable home in the area I'm building in (and therefore what design style to tend towards), and how much I could expect to sell for. I'd appreciate any tips and suggestions you have to give on the matter, I really need some outside constructive criticism from people who have some idea what they're talking about. :)",,False,self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,True,t3_1ie54n,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/1ie54n/building_selfsufficient_homesteads_as_a_business/,

I have completely revised the plans (while still staying with the same basic layout).

This plan is also just two apartments, along with wine/mead and beer making facilities (in the top right - the center is designated as storage for ingredients for both) and a great room for entertaining and ""family"" nights for all of us living there (in the lower right). I think I've done pretty well. Next major revision is for the person that is part of this that has requested separate space, as she plans to have kids, and wants to be courteous to the rest of us.

Here are the plans (the reddish brown areas are earth berms, piled against the exterior walls):

I stumbled upon this subreddit a while ago, and I've been reading posts and articles about self-sufficiency, solar/geothermal energy, gardening, etc. It all seems fascinating, even to embrace partly for a while with one foot still on the grid, so to speak. However, the ideas of self-sufficiency are very interesting to me, and [this AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a733s/iama_guy_who_dropped_out_from_the_rat_race_didnt/) is particularly inspiring.

I don't have many expectations of what that life would be like, but least of all do I expect it would be easy. The task seems daunting for the most experienced grower or handyman but virtually impossible for someone who lacks those skills.

I've thought of some cheap and what I feel would be effective floatation devises and construction methods. For making platforms that may be linked together reaching hundreds of feet. Though likely there are far better ways out there that have eluded me...

Upon the platforms settlers could generate wind &amp; solar energy whilst raise small animals. Crops could be grown via aquaponics in green houses. Rain water would need to be collected... 

Wind and waves could be an ruinous issue, hopefully firm anchoring could help mitigate waves. The calmest sea's possible would have to picked, this for me is the make or break issue. Much research and experimentation would need to be done...

But I will not be self sufficient, so the question may not apply in this reddit, but I will try. How can I make money out of the sea? 

Fishing? Collecting and crafting things from sea material? Serving as a tourist host or something like that? I need enough money to keep the boat. I need very little money extra, from food to clothes. I am used to live with the essential. But I don't really know how much will I have to spend.

Well... this is a very confusing post, because I am very confused. I WILL find a way to do it, because I know that there people who do it. But right now I don't even know how to start.

So.. maybe someone here knows something or could point me in the right direction.

An incinerating toilet is (usually) waterless. It works by having a small trap door, and ""flushing"" the unit merely opens that, the poop falls into a chamber that burns hot enough that waste is reduced to ash. To make cleanup simple, they usually have special paper that lays atop the trap door, and falls in with the waste. Supposedly these can be designed/vented such that your bathroom doesn't reek of burning shitpiles. I have no experience whether this is true.

Here is a [typical product](http://incinolet.com/aboutus_2.htm).

A urine diverting toilet usually has two drains and the bowl is shaped such that anything going towards the front goes down a smaller drain. Some of them have different flush cycles, so that less water is used for pee. The plumbing on most looks as if it allows each to flush to a different set of pipes.

Here is a [typical product](http://www.ecovita.net/ekologen.html).

But I can't find anything that combines the two. There do seem to be incineration units that could be combined with that last one, but it seems like it could be a no-fun situation to have to clean it should your aim be off to one side or the other.

In the research I did tonight, I learned that they can be used not just for home heating, but also to warm beds in a greenhouse so veggies can be produced year-round.

That said, I think I have a good understanding of how Rocket Mass Heaters work.  My question is this: can they be used if the primary combustion chamber is sealed in a wall?

For further clarification (and a query as to whether I understood the design), I have a few CAD drawings I did tonight.

If I understand basic operation of Rocket Mass Heaters, [this drawing](https://imgur.com/dBVdU) should be correct.

If I understand the airflow of Rocket Mass Heaters properly, [this drawing](https://imgur.com/fg9ID) should be accurate.

Air flow, as I understand it, from a rocket mass heater (obviously, the best heating coming through the exit/heating pipe) is the primary principle of the device.  Given that the combustion chamber is sealed and works on its own, I'm guessing that it could be sealed in a wall.  That is really my primary question here:  has anyone built a Rocket Mass Heater with the primary combustion chamber built into a wall, and if so, what were the results?

What does one do about income until the plants and animals are providing enough food and materials that one no longer needs to buy much?  
The fiance is considering income/rental properties, but I would prefer to stay out of that mess.

After all is settled and there is a nice routine, is it plausible to live on money earned from selling goods at a farmer's market?  Ideally, our only monetary needs would be paying off any debt leftover from our 'previous life,' such as the loan for buying the land or what-have-you.

The above link is far from being the cheapest, best, or carefully selected. I think they came up as first on a google search of ""commercial greenhouse"", those keywords chosen to skip all the little 4'x8' hobbyist ones that garden stores sell for $700.

Now, there are two factors that will immediately rule these out for most people. The first is just having the land to put one on. They have standard sizes on up to around 12,000 sq ft. The second factor to rule these out immediately will be the price... that largest one can be somewhere up around $40-50,000, and I don't believe it includes assembly.

I do not mean to imply that any of us has that kind of cash to shell out casually, or even that any of us should have that much land for something that will only produce some small fraction of the food that we eat. It is merely an example to get us on the same page, something that is considered typical in the industry. If your criticisms or advocacy is specific to a particular size or style, please link to or describe such in detail. If they deal with ""amount of land"" issues, again, please describe such in detail.

Where I am, land is boringly flat. If I intend to buy 80-320 acres in the next few years, that will be more than enough to fit even the largest practical greenhouse setup. This is a non-issue for me, and even those with more modest plans can choose more modest greenhouse models. 

It is also true that there isn't much tree cover here, and on the land I'm likely to buy, I doubt that I will find more than the occasional scraggly mesquite tree. No issues there. Other people might find that even if technically they have the acreage for something like this that the only sites possible will be shaded far too long throughout the day. 

This is not to say that I don't have concerns. For one, many months out of the year there is significant wind. I can't even find anything that talks about how high of wind load that these will tolerate before it becomes a problem. If you go with the polyethylene sheeting instead of the stiff plastic covering (which I assume is more expensive) will it just be shredded in a week?

Then there are sunlight concerns... though mine would be on flat land with no shade, there's just less sunlight at this latitude throughout the winter months than might be desired. While I think greenhouses are probably more viable than the naysayers claim, one thing is for sure: if I have to use supplemental artificial lighting, it becomes a big joke. 

Will any of the crops that I want to grow thrive in a warm greenhouse throughout the winter? Fresh salad vegetables are one of my wants... tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce. It's tough to discover whether or not these things are photoperiod sensitive (I believe this is the correct term). If they are to such a degree that warmth isn't enough and they need more light than is possible in the winter, a greenhouse loses 50% of its appeal immediately.

The other things that I might like to try are exotic tropicals. This presents complications immediately, because while my tomatoes might not mind keeping the temp at 65°F, if I try to grow black peppercorns or bananas or vanilla orchids, these all require higher temps to thrive. This might mean not just a second greenhouse, but perhaps several, all geared towards different temperatures and humidities. Even I must admit that this is a pretty big checkmark in the ""con"" column. So let's chalk that up as another valid criticism... while financial concerns likely limit you to a single small greenhouse, most desired uses of them would insist on recreating multiple climates.

Humidity control can be important if you're in a drier region as I am. The air around here is bone dry. It was this summer, and it seems to be the same this winter. Checking the internet tells me that this isn't a fluke or just my perception of it... so at least for some of us we'd have to contend with that. Personally I'm wondering if this doesn't mean that there can't be some synergy with aquaculture. One of the problems with that endeavor is that most of the farmable fish that you'd like to eat require year-round warm water to thrive. Putting a 2000 gallon tank inside the greenhouse would eat up some floor space, but the tank is a big heat sink that will help control temperature fluctuations and provide for some real humidity. Not to mention that purged water can just be used for irrigation (fish poop fertilizer!).

I think that such a thing would allow me to bump the humidity up high enough that I could keep plants that are more sensitive to such.

Then comes heating. I have to contend with average low temperatures in the low to mid 20s throughout January and into February. Weather almost as harsh in December and March. What's it going to cost to heat one of these? And what are my best options there? 

I don't see anything particularly good here. If I go with electric heat, I'm either blowing my power budget if on solar/wind or having a $1000 monthly bill if I'm on the grid (at a guess, wouldn't shock me if I underestimated this by a good bit). Don't say aquaculture... the 2000 gallons is a heat sink, but not a heat source.

You can do the little geothermal heat pumps that some use for their homes now days, but those will cost $50,000 for a sytem all by themselves, and probably still not keep things warm enough that you don't have to supplement. And any scheme where you burn biomass to keep them warm seems risky and would require you to check up on them once or twice a night.

Again, I can't find anything on the site I linked or any others that gives a good idea on how well these insulate or how much heating might cost. 

And here we have several dealbreakers already. We haven't even gotten to the subject of maintenance. Personally, I'm of the opinion that if after 15 or 20 years you have to spend $900 for some truss or framing to be replaced because it rusted a bit, that this is still within the bounds of self-sufficiency. (Assuming, of course, that you can afford it.)

However, it looks like that you'll be replacing either the plastic sheeting or siding more often than that. And until I find a place that lets me buy the GM plastic corn seed and the machinery to turn it into PET sheeting, there's no way that this resembles self-sufficiency. And there aren't many other options... in theory, such a building could use proper glass. But this simply isn't done in commercial operations. I can't even guess what that would cost, likely the frames I linked to wouldn't be adequate. Quadruple the cost, at least. And add all sorts of problems to the mix, from hailstorms to dumbass seagulls smacking into a pane and cracking it.

We won't be going completely rugged: like dehydrated food and clearing brush for our camping spots (I did plenty of that already in middle/high school). Basically we want to be able to power our handheld devices for emergency and minimal communication, as well as prepare some basic food items like Quinoa and Rice from a 300 W rice cooker.

I've found the battery we would like to use (it's also stated as compatible with solar panels):http://www.amazon.com/Duracell-DPP-600HD-Powerpack-Starter-Emergency/dp/B000TKHMWK

But I'm having trouble finding the right solar panel for it. Goal Zero and Sunforce seem to have decent options, but I can't decide on any which one to use.

Looking for: Ease of use, and ability to generate enough watts to recharge the stated Duracell 600 watt within a day or so of strong sunlight.

Problems: The solar panel cannot be too large, as in more than 40 inches in length. Main concern is theft when we're at camping music festivals like Coachella. So being able to quickly put it up and store it when we leave our site will be important. Price for panel must be &lt;$200

TL;DR: Compatible solar panel for Duracell 600HD. 10 W output minimum, size must be small to deter theft. Price must be &lt;$200

I've a large heritage house (3000 sq feet) that i've been slowly renovating and retrofitting. When I purchased it, it was without a furnace or a flue and had cheap baseboard heaters installed, which I've yet to replace, and would like to use as little as possible.  I've re-insulated and replaced all windows.  It has a new foundation.  I will very likely close off a few pipeless and unfinished rooms for the winter, reducing the area by ~ 500 sq ft or more, and there'll be a few other rooms that I can live with being cool.  What else?  I was able to afford a metal roof on the back half for now.  Rest will be installed next year, hopefully.  High ceilings on first floor.  Central staircase is quite open.

So, it's essentially a blank slate for heating right now.  Wasn't planning on having it livable by this winter, so my heating budget is ~ $2000.

Have an option to get a deal on a ductless heat pump, installed for around that price.  It's a rather low grade model, though (midea/toshiba, and 18,000 btu, split), so I'm not fully sold.

Open to anything that falls in that budget - unconventional or blatantly obvious - but i'd rather it not be just a temporary fix... heaps of convect air panels? infrared? rocket mass heater? solar air heaters? a combination?

The one I saw that I liked the most, given the space and privacy requirements I've been faced with (myself, and two others, both sisters, one with a serious, long-term boyfriend - he's also very into the project), was the split level design, which allows for a larger home with a relatively small footprint, yet maintains the efficiency of a small Earthship.

We all would like to maintain our own private spaces (just a basic human need), but will be largely living together.  Also, all three of us have large families, and we want to be able to provide space to host them, particularly since we'll likely be miles and miles away from the closest hotel.

That said, I've worked on two designs, both providing three apartments (each including a kitchenette and a full bathroom) along with a shared space that includes a large kitchen and a half bathroom, along with a large, comfortable entertaining/leisure space.

The only difference between the two designs is the number of bedrooms per apartment.  I'm including both designs here.

I know the biggest difference between the two designs is a higher cost to build the larger one.  Because of that, I'm leaning towards the smaller one, but will need a consensus from the others involved before I make a final decision.

Anyway, here are the designs:

I am proud to announce that I have been accepted into a four-month long natural building apprenticeship. I applied based on my vision of bringing an affordable and sustainable solution to a big problem for poor working class folks here in the Rio Grande Valley- by building community and sharing skills, we can literally design and construct our own ecologically responsible dwellings, courtyards, community spaces, gardens,... ahem, well, whatever we want! - in a way that uses our abundancy when reducing/reusing 'waste', respects the Earth, and by sharing skills is truly sustainable.
 
This intensive training will be taking place near Asheville, North Carolina from June 3 to September 28, 2012. I will be travelling over a thousand miles from the deep south border town of Edinburg, TX.
 
""WHAT IS A WASI APPRENTICESHIP? Kleiwerks International and the Women of the Americas Sustainability Initiative (WASI) are offering WASI Apprenticeships in 15 countries across the Americas. The Apprenticeships are hands-on leadership trainings in ecological design-build practices for women. 8-12 apprentices + two assistants will be selected per country, each of whom will also do a follow-up project of their choosing after the four months is over...  WASI is an alliance of women leaders who construct, educate, organize, and advocate for strong and empowered communities through ecological design-build practices with the aim of creating a socially and ecologically resilient world!""
 
The privilege of being able to attend has much to do with this conscious vision as much as is does my being able bodied, and in this case, a woman, as this particular program is run by 2-3 women and for a group of 8-12 women. There also happens to be a special scholarship for low-income mujeres from the 956 and northern Tampaulipas to attend. It was especially hard to decide to accept it because I will have to be away from Paulo Esme for all but two weeks (if all goes as planned) of those four months. I do believe this path has been set before me to improve my skills and our community, because the only thing that seems to be lacking here is that I am not economically privileged. As always, I refuse to let that be a hinderance to achieving one of the many so-called idealistic goals when the path is right before my wings. I painfully made the decision to do something I think will benefit my family and community.
 
The cost of the apprenticeship itself is $5,000. To some, unimaginable. To others, a fraction of monthly salary. To me, it's 5,000 people pitching in a dollar. It's each of my facebook friends giving me a $10 sponsorship- less than $3 a month to help empower RGV communities! It's every single person that's reading this to pass it along and sincerely ask someone they know to contribute a humble donation of whatever they can. Bring out your corona bottles and ms. piggy banks everyone! I am determined to match the scholarship with community support!
 
I want to offer everyone that offers any kind of support to me my services in any way we imagine together upon my return. Need repairs, want to experiment, an idea for improving the community? I can also work out any personal loans if you would rather loan money. My last resort is credit cards or winning the lottery! Please share this note with everyone you know!

REDDIT! IF ANYTHING I EVER POST GOES VIRAL BY GOLLY LET THIS BE IT!! I absolutely need $5,000 in order to support my son and for all our related expenses while I'm out training to change his world!

I'd really like it to be spring assisted, and I'd like a lock release method that is fairly easy to work. I tried a Gerber FAST today and the little unlocking lever is horrible.

The second big feature is the single bevel edge. I found it was much easier to sharpen consistently. I'm not sold on whether I need the serrations, but they seem useful.

ANYHOW, here's a little paragraph about egg storage that I thought r/selfsufficiency would find interesting:

&gt;Eggs will keep almost any length of time in lime-water properly prepared. One pint of coarse salt, and one pint of unslacked lime, to a pailful of water. If there be too much lime, it will eat the shells from the eggs; and if there be a single egg cracked, it will spoil the whole. They should be covered with lime-water, and kept in a cold place. The yolk becomes slightly red; but I have seen eggs thus kept perfectly sweet and fresh at the end of three years. The cheapest time to lay down eggs is early in spring, and the middle and last of September. It is bad economy to buy eggs by the dozen as you want them.""

Again, comments are encouraged!",obsidian468,21,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/pbj3i/i_just_got_some_great_compliments_and_advice_on/,"If you just want to get to the meat of things, [here's the site plan.](http://i.imgur.com/rNDT3.png)  All others, please take a look at the site plan, and then consider my explanation of things below.

Here's a rough explanation of what's in the drawing:

Starting from the top left, and working towards the bottom right:

Top left: apartment one (likely mine), and the wine and beer making areas (respectively) to the right of them, with a storage space between the two for storing ingredients, equipment, and product in need of aging.  This part of the structure is located above and behind the front of the structure - everything is built into a hill.

Bottom left: Apartment 2 (likely first partner's), and to the right of that, the shared space with a huge kitchen (my dream), and a large entertaining space.

In front of the left side homes is a low wall, that will enclose groomed outdoor space, along with a grill (and possibly a wood or coal oven for breads and pizzas), seating areas, and plants.

Middle: a four car garage, giving enough space for all of us to park, as well as plenty of additional storage.  The garage also allows access to all living spaces through indoor means, should be weather be bad.

Right: Second (and maybe third) partner's living space, complete with an extra multi-use room, to be used for whatever she wants to use it for - a kid's playroom, practice space for her music, her boyfriend's hobby, whatever.

In front of second partner's home is another low wall enclosing a groomed front yard, also providing outdoor living space, a grill, and eating space.

There is a wide driveway that leads to the garage, along with another two-car parking spot on the left side.

Both homes also have brick (all recycled) walkways leading to the front doors from the driveways.

One additional outside space is to the left of the structure.  The gray curved piece on the right (labelled ""up"") is a sloped ramp leading to a second floor patio space.

Also, there is an outdoor route to the beer/wine area leading up the stairs to the right of the garage and along a path behind it.  This path is also above the garage.  Perhaps, in the future, a small patio space will also be installed here.

Some additional notes:

All of the rear walls are curved to provide strength to the overall structure.  This will create some interesting challenges in finishing the interior spaces (particularly when cabinets and shelves are involved).

The outside walls will be built out of a variety of materials, depending on what is cheapest at the time:

 - Used tires: used tires will be stacked like bricks, and have earth compacted inside of them to the point that the tire bulges.  This is a very back-breaking method of construction, but provides some of the strongest walls possible.  To finish them, they are coated with mud plaster, created from excavated soil.

 - ""Earthbags"": Earthbags are plastic bags filled with a mixture of soil, sand, pearlite, and gravel (mixes vary depending on climate).  These are also stacked like bricks, and coated with a mud plaster, made from excavated soil.

 - Hay bales: This may actually end up being the preferred solution, given that northern GA is very heavily agricultural, and hay bales are plentiful and very cheap.  Hay bales are also stacked like bricks, treated with a wet filling/adhesive solution, and ultimately coated with, as with the other two, a mud plaster created from excavated earth.

As far as interior finishing, we may stick with the natural mud wall finish for some rooms (it's essentially the same as adobe walls in appearance), but could also go to a greater degree of finish (even as far as paint or wallpaper) for some walls.  Also, for wooden components, shelves, doors, windows, and other such things, we'll be trying to get as much reclaimed material as possible (such as from barns or homes being torn down).

Windows and concrete may be our largest bills in building this, as the large sized windows in the front side of this project (mostly 72""-84"" width, and up to 80"" high) are sometimes hard to come by used (and therefore may have to be purchased new, or even custom), and fresh concrete, while not expensive, can get costly in the quantities we'll need.

That said, my original estimate of $200,000 to build everything and start the farm still stands.  I fully believe we can do this in that budget.

***

Not included in the drawing I posted:

 - The power management structure (as this will likely be in the back of the hill that this is constructed in - or perhaps even completely separate.

 - The composting toilets and cold cellar areas (these are all located under the main structures, in a basement area).

 - The equipment shed (which I have not designed yet).  It will likely be 25'x25', with a 20' garage (overhead) door.

The big thing is that you see the basic floor plan. The vehicle sizes in the garage give you a basic idea, but also keep in mind that all bedrooms (side to side, and front wall to the apex of the curve in the rear wall) are 12'x15'-6"".

It's a huge structure.  I will build it.

(tired of there not being any stories here),NoMoreNicksLeft,23,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/9ym0t/open_discussion_thread_tired_of_there_not_being/,"Well, last night I decided to make some homemade ginger ale from this recipe:

http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/cheese/Ginger_Ale_Ag0.htm

I've posted that site myself before, but someone put it up at /r/cooking, and I thought what the hell. True, I can't claim this is truly self-sufficient... I do grow ginger, but I hardly have a lemon tree or a field full of sugar beets. So the grocery store has to suffice for now.

(Question: How the hell does one culture their own yeast? The only stuff I can find is for sour dough starter...)

Anyway, the ginger smelled wonderful, even if it was a pain to grate up. Thing is, I misread the packet of yeast, thinking it was a 1/4 of a teaspoon... it's really 2 and 1/4 teaspoons. So whereas the bottle wasn't supposed to get firm until 24 hours later, it was ready to burst within about 4 hours.

I didn't realize I had used too much yeast until today. Yikes, but that stuff was boozy. We tasted it, got a light buzz, and poured it.

Tonight, I've made up a bottle of lemon-lime soda (same recipe, but no ginger and 1 whole lime and lemon each). Hopefully, it turns out better.

Of my exotic plants... my banana trees are doing well now that they've had to come outside. New leaves are growing much slower than in summer (where I'd get a new one about every week), but they're still growing. I think they're going to overwinter fairly well this year.

I've managed to get peppercorns to germinate, this after a whole year's worth of trying. Third place I've bought them from (Whatcom Seed).

My pistachios are going moldy in the fridge though, if I'm lucky I'll have maybe 1 or two that will survive. Bummer that.

One other thing... for those who try to grow seedlings inside, especially this time of year, check out Walmart's pharmacy section for cheap heating pads. The things claim to tolerate getting wet (though caution is still advisable), they don't get very hot, and they're $11 each. Much better than the ones made specifically for seedlings that cost $50 and up.

Best of all? I have a potential source for some bugs I've been wanting to get. These little things called cochineals.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal

All along, I've been hoping to find a scientific supply house, or even someone who cultures them and sells the things for this purpose. Wrong approach. In some places in the southwest where people landscape with cactus, the bug will naturally infest them, and gardeners and landscapers consider them a really annoying pest. I've managed to find someone who has this problem and is perhaps willing to ship a lobe off of a cactus with some of the little critters.

Don't go and snitch to the USDA on me though... I was going to go ahead and do things proper. It seems that I'd need a USDA permit that takes 4-6 months to get (complete with site inspection), and a Tennessee department of agriculture permit. Perhaps with one from the sending state as well. However, I think I will risk Tennessee's massive cactus industry and import these things anyway.

And this holds true even for many things that aren't on the list of traditional garden vegetables. Planting fruit trees or berry bushes or even putting up some trellises for grapes and kiwis isn't out of the ordinary. Even eggs, milk, and meat aren't really out of the question... if you're not yet producing some of that for yourself, you at least have a good idea of what you'd need to do it and how to go about getting started.

There are a few things though that it doesn't seem quite so easy to consider doing for ourselves. And yet they aren't quite all exotic spices that you could learn to live without.

These are things where growing them isn't so much the problem... like anything else, you generally stuff seeds into the ground, and a plant starts growing. The problem is, ""how can you make it scale?"" Things like wheat, rice, and animal feeds (hay, corn, and soy). Perhaps other grains as well.

Well, first you have to consider how much of this you would need to grow per year to avoid the need to buy it at the grocery store. The average american eats [134 pounds of wheat flour](http://www.visualeconomics.com/food-consumption-in-america_2010-07-12/). Whether or not you exceed this limit or you're on the low side, this is a significant amount. Depending on your preferences, other grains could have a similar magnitude within your diet. 

Wheat flour, the staple of baking everything from breads to cakes, from gravies to pasta, is nothing more than the ground-up seed of wheat grass, as I'm sure you're all aware. In times past, the apparatus to grind wheat was cumbersome. In the dark ages of Europe, it consisted of little more than [mortar and pestle](http://www.mvtradings.com/images/RMP55.jpg). Wouldn't have been much fun to be a baker back then. The two cups of flour could take awhile. A few centuries later, you tended to see building-sized contraptions with the proverbial millstone doing the grinding. Some used waterwheels, others would use windmills, and when neither were available you'd yoke an ox up to the wheel to turn it. These are all less than ideal for the modern homesteader.

Thankfully, there are modern solutions. I've been looking at this one:

http://grainmaker.com/

I've yet to buy one (it's pricey), but I do think it seems to be a quality piece of equipment. The electric motor attachment would make it fairly easy to use... set it up with enough wheat grain for 2 or 3 lbs of flour once a week, put it on in the background and get some other work done while babysitting it. I don't know if I'd like this particular brand, or if I'd go with another... but with something like this in your arsenal, a large chunk of the problem is taken care of.

But how do we grow enough of it? Let's say that you have a family of 3-5 people, you're looking at (conservatively) needing several hundred pounds of it each year. How much land is that? In the US, crop yields are often measured in bushels. It's a somewhat archaic unit of measurement, and unique in that it varies from crop to crop. For our purposes though, a bushel of wheat weighs 60 pounds. So, we're looking at needing about 2 bushels per person, more or less.

Record yields vary quite a bit, and only give us the basic outline. In some places it will be irrigated by expensive systems that cost many thousands of dollars, and the yields can easily exceed 100 bushels per acre. Irrigation is expensive though, and in many areas the farmer is willing to forgo this expense and make do with yields that won't ever go past 50 bushels per acre.

Many of you are familiar with the size of an acre, and you have enough acreage to already be thinking about having your own little wheat field. The rest of us may still be stuck in a suburb, doing our best in the backyard with a tiny vegetable garden. An acre is a [little more than half of a football/soccer field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre). If you own a lot in some suburb, it's probably a about an 1/8th of an acre.

So, if you want about 10 bushels (enough flour for your family, and some left over), this is going to require something on the order of a quarter acre if you manage record non-irrigated yields. There are a few gotchas with this figure though... for such a small size, some decent irrigation may be possible, which should double your potential yield. On the other hand, most of us want to shy away from commercial hybrid seed... we'd like to save some for next year's planting or maybe we don't trust the Monsanto and Bayer Crop Science type of companies.

So, if we find something suitable (not necessarily heirloom), we can figure that it will halve the yield. I've done a little digging, and it's not always that pessimistic, there are some indicators that with wheat commercial hybrids are only giving you a 20% advantage, but there are others sources that make it seem higher.

So, a half acre will get us 12-15 bushels or so, with the potential for maybe 25 bushels if we go the effort of setting up irrigation.

There are many different factors that can affect this, of course. Wheat isn't too picky a crop, to some extent it will grow very nearly anywhere in North America. But there are places where they grow it more than others, simply because it is more economical there. The midwest sees alot of this, but tending towards the north more. In the US, Nebraska grows quite a bit, as do the Dakotas and Montana. Eastern Oregon and Washington state as well. But it seems even Colorado, Oklahoma, and northern Texas grow some. (And of course Canada grows quite a bit, when they're not being chased by polar bears and hiding in their igloos). If I didn't list your region though, don't let it discourage you (unless it's Hawaii, then you're just screwed). Rather than making it impossible to grow wheat, it will probably just affect yield.

Decent soil helps, of course. Fertilizer does too. And things like planting times and methods will make a big difference here, it may take several years to get it right. Those who wish to go the organic route shouldn't give up on this either, I've read more than a few stories of the Amish managing record yields for their regions with nothing more than hog manure as fertilizer.

We've talked about how much land you might need, and what you could expect from it if things go well. But it's not quite so simple as transplanting a few tomato plants out in the garden and picking them by hand once that time comes. You could of course, cast the seed by hand into a small field you've tilled. But the typical garden tiller will have your hands numb for a month after doing half an acre... and just casting wheat seed by hand on top of the ground will see quite a bit of it blow away, rot, or be eaten by birds and animals. There are some hand-pulled planter devices that will help plant the seed at the right depth, and give you more even dispersal, of course. But come time to harvest, this is still going to be overwhelming. When wheat is harvested by hand, it's necessary to scythe (cut it) with a big heavy blade, bundle it up as you go. Then, you take these bundles of wheat stalks, and thresh the grain off of the stalks. In times past, you'd usually be beating it with some type of club to do that. Only then could it be ground into flour.

Sounds involved, doesn't it?

If you're no opponent of making things easier, you might want to consider a small tractor. Not that $400,000 monstrosity that you see on TV once in awhile that's 6 lanes wide and looks like it would chew up a Toyota if it got in the way. But [something like this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmall) (thanks for the link, VicinSea). They're still out there, the early ones were built like tanks, and they're often pretty cheap. Depending on how much work you're willing to do to get them into running condition, they could be as cheap as a few hundred dollars, but even one that you could drive home won't set you back more than $2000-3000.

And what can you do with one, you might ask? Well, the tractor has any number of different pieces of equipment that can be pulled behind it. Plows and harrows to loosen and turn the soil prior to planting. Planters that carefully plant nearly any type of seed you could want to plant. Manure spreaders that make the job of getting the pig poop spread out through the field. But most of all? Equipment that not only cuts the wheat straw, but also removes the grain itself from them and separates it from all the stuff you don't want to eat. (This is the origin of the word ""combine"" for the big monstrosities, they *combine* the action of harvesting with that of threshing).

There are many pieces of used, antique equipment out there waiting to be bought on the cheap, much of it quite usable even without much repair. For something you'd use to harvest wheat, I think something like this is what you'd want:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/hunter1828/501634539/

There are others of course, those used to harvest soy beans and corn. I've even been reading up on some of this that was meant to harvest cotton, something that's of interest to me.

So what does this get you? I've been talking to a guy on the antique tractor forums who grows about 8 acres of soy and wheat, depending on what interests him that year. He claims that he's spending about 16 hours (per year) to cultivate 4 acres of wheat or soy (not much difference between the two, hour-wise). 

That won't scale down perfectly, preparing equipment takes the same amount of time whether you're doing a quarter acre of 20. But You might only be spending a few hours each year, and bringing in one bushel basket after another of wheat grain.

That's something to think about.",,False,self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,True,t3_dnii2,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/dnii2/what_should_we_be_doing_about_those_things_which/,

The problem is our soil. We live up in the hills just north of Arkansas and it's extremely rocky. The thought of getting a tractor up here, digging up a bunch of soil and trying to sift all the rock out just seems unrealistic to me. You can't even stick a shovel half an inch into the ground.

What sort of decortication/press is required? how practical is it? 

At the moment I have a few sunflowers, I would like to try getting oil from them just for shits and giggles, and I have been wondering how I could go about doing that.

EDIT:----------------------------------------------------------
since starting this post, I have been doing a bit of research on the subject.

http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_supply.html#Oilpress seems to have a lot of info on presses

http://journeytoforever.org/biofuel_library/oilpress.html Has heaps of really good info on the topic

The TLDR version seems to be: There are 2 different kinds (broadly speaking) of sunflower seeds: the type meant for eating and the type meant for extracting oil from. If extracting oil from the eating variety, it apparently needs to be hulled first, but the oil type does not. You can just blend up the seeds, hulls and all, and stick it in a press.

The link above even has plans for making a press, which is pretty cool. The plan would be I think from here to try and find the oil variety (I think i have the eating variety), so i can extract oil from them, then give all the left over pressed seed to the chickens.

It seems there is a book about it here:

1276813160.0,19,self.SelfSufficiency,cg6ll,I want to start an ecovillage with a couple of twists...,BillBrasky_,25,6,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/cg6ll/i_want_to_start_an_ecovillage_with_a_couple_of/,"I'm sure the title is corny, but I just want to write all of my thoughts down and see if anyone (who takes the time to read it) would have any insights or comments to share and to get a feel for overall interest in a project like this.  I've seen several other people doing things along the same thread but I want to mix it up a little bit.

I want to start a remote ecovillage in Alaska.  I have lived there for a year and am completely taken in by the beauty of the place.  I spent the entire winter outdoors (not literally) and was very comfortable with the environment.  The only word to describe summer is epic.

Have you seen [Alone in the Wilderness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJKd0rkKss)?  That was the original inspiration that struck just as my value system got deep underway into a radical change.   After graduating college and working hard in the ""real world"" for several years I was unceremoniously unplugged from the matrix.  Once you wake up there is no going back to sleep.  Money doesn't grow on trees?  Then why are people spending 30 years of their lives paying for a structure made largely out of trees?  Mortgage, Mort, Mortuary...   A payment until you die?  To who?  Some guy who said I can live in a structure made out of trees?  No thanks, I'll eliminate the middle man.  &lt;/rant&gt;

Part of the issue for me is that I'm an engineer.  I can build all kinds of things and things I can't currently build I can usually look at and just see the pieces come together.  Due to that I look forward to basically recreating the foundations of modern society in a fun steam-punk fashion such that every ounce of effort extended goes into improving or maintaining my quality of life.  

I'm not a luddite, and I don't have any crazy belief systems.  I just see clearly how to reconstruct everything I need from materials I know how to obtain with tools I know how to use.  I have done a ton of research and a fair amount of practice.  I don't know everything and am PLANNING on getting my ass handed to me in a couple of knowledge areas as I learn (farming for instance).  I am not afraid to learn from others and I have always been able to figure out what I needed to figure out to get done what I needed to get done.

I'm really cutting this short since I don't want to go on and on until I sound like I'm just daydreaming.  I'm having visions, the difference between a dreamer and a visionary is that visionaries make dreams happen.  I'm not full of it.  Here is kind of my crazy guy resume:  When I went to Alaska in 2008 it was specifically to scout this out and determine the true feasibility of the project.  Since that time I have acquired and practiced with a chainsaw mill and gotten fairly good at wood working.  Good enough to start with.  I'm an electrical engineer and fairly good with motors and machinery.  I'm very good with electronics and programming.  I can generate electricity any number of feasible and great ways.  I have a CNC milling machine and lathe that I draw parts for and manufacture.  I have a pilot's license and will have my plane in the next year.  That will make ""running to town"" easily possible.  Actually, the land I like you can access town via river in a boat during summer and snow machine during winter.  I don't plan to not work and live off the land at first.  I plan to work when I need to and be as self-sufficient as possible, but if that means needing some supplies here and there then so be it.  I don't want to hold hands and sing songs nor do I want to vote on crap.  I want to work together with cool like-minded people.  

Originally I didn't want to have anyone within 50 miles but as time went on my anti-social nature wore off a bit and now I think it would be great to be able to work together on stuff.  Live in a tent camp for a summer building a couple of cabins together.  Each cabin would be ""owned"" by some group member and would be executed in their vision, but everyone comes together to help like an old fashioned barn-raising.  We'd convene on my neighbors garden with a few others and get it ready for the season then go to the next neighbors and repeat.  I would love to see a group of 10 homesites in fairly close proximity that could work together.  I'm not sure of the overall structure, either everyone simply buys pieces of land in SOMEWHAT close proximity (how close is individual choice, could be 10 miles down river and still be neighbors) or an actual land trust with satellite parcels?  I don't know.  I don't even know where to find people who are interested in this or if anyone is interested.  I'd love to talk about it more though!


tl;dr: I'm working hard for the next two years as I prepare for a real leap into an off-the-grid lifestyle and looking for cohorts along the way!

It wouldn't be a proper search engine (it wouldn't attempt to spider websites), so it would need user contributed links.

It's unfinished and unstyled (pretty ugly too). But before I claim that it's ready for beta testing, I wanted some feedback on just what people might like to see in such a thing.

These are the ideas that I've been playing around with for it: when you submit a variety of seed/plant/whatever that you'd like to know where to get... this gets entered into a expandable ""tree"" list. Anyone coming after you when they hit the main page will see how many cultivars remain unsourced. Not to mention that the unsourced seeds would be styled differently in the list. Of course, people would need to also submit sources for these when they know them.

Do we really need user registration for this? Does anyone want to have their names or handles attached to the seed or source submissions, or even comments on them?

Does the expandable treelist make sense to anyone other than myself? There would be about a dozen root level categories (""Food"", ""Fodder"", ""Ornamental"", etc) many with subcategories. (In what category would a loofa actually go?!)

How willing would people be to use and contribute to a content-heavy but poorly styled website? I'm not much of an artist, to be honest.

Should this cover things other than plants? And just what? I've searched before on just where a person could stuff to grow mushrooms. There are a few types of insects a person might even want to raise (bees, silkworms, pest predators). Hell, should I open it up to livestock in general?

And how interested would you be at all, really? Most of you just want to know where to find some interesting but unspecific heirloom tomatoes... where coconut seedlings or vanilla cuttings can be bought, do you even really care?

So I decided to make my own and did a test with some plants receiving my own concoction that had stood for a while, and some receiving the store bought stuff.

The results weren't earth shattering but I got a much better crop from the plants that were treated with my own stuff than the store bought and have used it ever since.

It's pretty easy to make if you live in a rural area, not so easy if you are in the city.

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/IoCRq.jpg) is the finished mess.

1: Find a container with a lid that can hold a fair amount of the finished mix.

2: Find a drawstring / porous sack bag and a knitting needle.

3: Locate a field that contains Sheep, preferably one fenced with barbed wire.

4: Go round the field picking up the Sheep muck with a trowel and store it in the bag. Collect any wool you see along the way although there usually isn't much.

5: Now go around the edge of the field near the fence and you should find quite a lot of wool attached to the barbs of the wire where the Sheep have been sheltering or trying to get through, collect all this as well and put it in the sack.

Back at home fill your container with hot water and lay your sack of muck down on the grass. Pierce it all the way through many times with the knitting needle.

Dunk the bag into the water, attach the knitting needle to the drawstring (so you can agitate it later without needing to fish it out - it will stink like hell) and put the lid 3/4 over the top with the needle hanging down.

Leave it for a while - but stir and agitate it once every so often. After a bit you will notice a scum forming on the top.

Once the water looks a bit like gravy you are ready to use it (a few weeks). Be careful mixing it in your watering can, it is very strong and could burn your plants.

EDIT: I guess you could use mule shit like this as well but remember an old timer telling me cow muck is no good - but its old wives tale territory already ;)

These websites have many resources for just about every possible agricultural crop or animal imaginable, many of them free for download. Even those titles that are only available in hardcopy are quite detailed and everything you would expect... they aren't pamphlets written by hacks for the Waldenbooks crowd.

They often give extensive information for diagnosing diseases and identifying weeds. They give an acceptable overview of what is commercially viable in your region. Just don't let this fool you though, just because they can't grow strawberries commercially where you are, you can still grow them... so check out titles outside your region too.

Often, highlights and samples of these titles are available on Google Books. Usually it's cut off right as it gets interesting, but it's more than enough to determine whether the title is worth the $30. Furthermore, these titles do show up on Amazon most all the time, but I've seen instances where someone is charging $90 for the hardback when the original site only asks $42. 

This is a work in progress, so please help me add to it if I've missed any.

Anyone care to help?,NoMoreNicksLeft,18,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/95iz4/the_seedplantlivestock_directory_website_ive_been/,"I won't call it beta, nowhere near close to that... and even ""alpha"" is rather generous.

It's ugly. I'm a programmer, not a designer, and what css is there is just so that it's not a completely jumbled mess.

No registration needed, and to be honest I'm tempted to never put that in: I don't think that it should be needed, and I'm willing to clean up the spam if I ever see it.

So far, it's possible to submit varieties of plants to the list. You should be submitting things like ""Black Krim Tomato"" rather than just plain ""Tomato"" when it makes sense to. No need to know where it can be found... if there's something you want, submit it, and maybe someone else can find a source for it.

You can also submit sources. That's really kind sketchy at the moment. So far, the only thing you need to submit is the name of the place, and the URLs where the seeds can be purchased (though, they need not be ""purchased"", if there's a free source, submit that too). If the plant is available in more than one form (seed and potted plant), it allows you to submit a URL for each.

Some of you have expressed an interest in listing your own seeds for sale or trade or whatever... you're welcome to do so. Put up the URL to your ebay store, or failing that just do a mailto: email address. I'm fine with either.

The categories themselves are far from perfect at this point. I could use some help with that. The ""Food"" category definitely needs to be thought out carefully... it needs several levels of subcategories or it will become unnavigable. Already, there are 120 heirloom apple varieties that I wish to submit to it myself. So, unless it's drilled down pretty deep, each subcategory could have thousands. 

I would appreciate any suggestions on what those should be.

As you might note, some submissions are potentially illegal and certainly could cause trouble. While I won't rule out those right this minute, let's keep those to a minimum for now. I am aware of hemp's utility for rope, burlap, and even finer cloths. I am even open-minded about its usefulness as a medicine. But we can always add it in later. For now, the ""Recreational substances"" categories should only be used for tobacco or alcohol items. 

I think I've once more broken the comment system, but eventually I'd like to be able to allow you to comment on varieties, sources for them, and perhaps even the categories themselves. I've already submitted one item and its source, but the very first comment on this thing is how you should never buy from them (ordered the seed 14 months ago, never shipped them... and Dave's Garden has alot of complaints about them as well). Hell, we should probably even be able to rate them.

http://seedfinder.homedns.org/

Finally, if anyone out there is a web designer, amateur or otherwise, I could certainly use a hand making it look not ugly.

New, revised floor plan is at the end of this post.

Now, as many have suggested, I'm focusing on the home first.

I've incorporated many of the earthship concepts into the home (recycled tires, bottle and can wall construction, etc).

Here's a new rough draft of the home floor plan that includes square footage of both climate-controlled, non-climate-controlled, and greenhouse areas.

Several things not shown on this draft are as follows:

* A sloped concrete roof that drains into a series of water cisterns to provide water for several functions of the home and surrounding farm.  Additionally, on the concrete roof, I'll be placing the solar hot water heater (draining to an insulated tank in the dwelling), and any additional solar panels that don't integrate into the structure.

* Can and bottle wall construction - I plan to use this extensively, both inside and outside the house.

* Roofing: a sloped concrete roof over several feet of soil.  This will house the solar hot water heater and solar panels that cannot be incorporated into the home design, and will also provide rain run-off into water cisterns to be used in the home and for watering crops.

The design also includes a bathroom relocation/redesign that puts all of the toilets close together, so as to best utilize the composting toilet tank, which will be located under the center of the home.

Power source details as well as other details about the project can be found in my previous post, which I linked above (be sure to read it fully, as much of what I stated in my original post has been revised in the comments after getting some great advice from the citizens of /r/selfsufficiency.

This sounds like a great idea but I am curious if anyone has seen any sort of testing on these things that determine if they are at all practical for use in a building.

Surely the air that comes out of them is warmer yes but no one seems to ever test and document the inside room temperature.

So far, it's been rather fruitless, so to speak. The ingredients are easy to assemble, and quick to put together... but the results are less than tasty.

The first time I tried to make ginger ale. As much of a pain as it was to grate ginger, the aroma of it is rather lovely. I also included lemon juice, though the recipe says that this is optional. The resulting ""whatever"" (Should I be using brewing or winemaking terms here? It'd be must, for wine, I think) smelled nicely enough. But instead of 24-48 hours for the bottle to harden up, it was done in 3.5 hours. (Though, the carbonation was certainly lively.)

My mistake was obvious after the fact... the writing on my yeast packet was a little crinkled, and I misread ""2 and 1/4 teaspoons"" as ""1/4 teaspoons"" and used the whole thing. A typical foil packet has 9 times as much as you should use. Don't make my mistake... while I didn't have it explode on me, that could easily have happened.

The second time around, I decided to experiment a little, instead of ginger ale, I tried to make lemon-lime soda. One of each fruit, no ginger, but otherwise the same recipe... and of course, the correct amount of yeast (which means wasting the rest of the packet).

This time, it took far longer than 3.5 hours for it to ferment. It even took longer than 48 hours... it was very nearly 5 whole days for it to harden the bottle up. And there was very little visual evidence of carbonation.

Well, I chilled it for a few days, and we tasted it. Not much better than the first try. Keep in mind I don't drink liquor, so I have very little experience there... but it seemed almost as boozy tasting as the first batch. Hardly any carbonation at all, if this were store-bought soda, I would have thought it nearly a week flat.

I did use the correct amount of yeast. So I'm still unsure what went wrong here. It's possible that the bottle didn't seal well (I was using a different one at this point). It's possible that baker's yeast isn't ideal. It may have taken too long to ferment, this time of year we aren't using the furnace, so it's not exactly toasty inside, which at least explains why it took so long to ferment. 

Anyway, I'm still experimenting. I've ordered some root beer extract from Amazon.

http://www.amazon.com/Zatarains-Extract-4-Ounce-Plastic-Bottles/dp/B00122E62S

It's not exactly self-sufficient, but it'll be awhile before I have enough sassafras trees to use real homemade ingredients.

I've also gotten a few vanilla beans. Ouch, but they're expensive. Expensive enough that I'll be using the cheap vanilla extract the first few tries til I get this right. Also, if you shop at Kroger for this, keep looking... I almost walked off with the spice bottle that had 1 bean in it for $8.50, but they had another brand hidden that had 3 for $7.25. Too bad I can't get my own vanilla vine to thrive well enough to grow these, eh?

I have some thoughts on the lemon-lime soda thing. Though the juices smell nice enough mixed together, it's still not quite the right taste. I suspect that this should also, or maybe instead, use the lemon and lime oils (purchasable, but you could also press the peels for this, I think). And maybe something else.

And as for cola, after reading up on it, I doubt that you'd really want to use actual kola beans. They seem rather nasty, from what I've read. Most websites seem to agree that the flavor that we like from Coke is cinnamon plus vanilla. I don't honestly enjoy it enough to bother trying, but I'd certainly enjoy hearing from others who do so.

I hope that I've inspired a few others to try this, and maybe helped you past a few of the dumb mistakes.

PS Anyone know if these lemon seeds I got out of the attempt will grow into anything worth keeping?

These videos focus mostly on the generator itself. I'm interested in the advantages of using something like this and the contexts in which it might provide energy efficiency benefits. I would appreciate any comments from those who understand this technology and how it might apply to living off-grid, especially with respect to any energy efficiency benefits.

Natural calf rennet is extracted from the inner mucosa of the fourth stomach chamber (the abomasum) of young calves. These stomachs are a by-product of veal production. If rennet is extracted from older calves (grass-fed or grain-fed) the rennet contains less or no chymosin but a high level of pepsin and can only be used for special types of milk and cheeses. As each ruminant produces a special kind of rennet to digest the milk of its own mother, there are milk-specific rennets available, such as kid goat rennet especially for goat's milk and lamb rennet for sheeps milk. Rennet or digestion enzymes from other animals, like swine-pepsin, are not used in cheese production.

Historically rennet was extracted from calf stomachs by killing the calves, cutting the stomach into strips, scraping the lining to remove surface fat, stretching it onto racks where moisture is removed, grinding it and then finally mixing it with a salt solution until the rennin is extracted.

Current technology cuts genes from a calf cell and injects it into the genomes of bacteria and yeast. This produces high quality chymosin that is not subject to the volatile market for animal derived rennet. It is estimated that 70% of domestic cheese is produced with bioengineered chymosin. *For a consumer who does not want bioengineered foods, animal or microbial rennet should be their choice.*

Generally, rennet is a dried powder or a liquid that has a industry-standard strength. This would be very difficult to do in a self-sufficient way. An alternative to that commercial process is to use the stomach lining itself.

**How to prepare the Rennet: (From eHow, I think)**

1. Clean the stomach of the calf as soon after the animal’s death as possible. Do this by using your hands and scrubbing the interior and exterior of the stomach in cold running water and sea salt. Handfuls of salt can be used to scour the entire area prior to adding water, and this will help to preserve the stomach as well. [Pictures for those who can Stomach them.](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/Rennet/rennet_preparation.html)

2. Scratch away any particles of food or bile that may be stuck to the inner walls of the stomach. This task is much easier if the calf has not been fed 12 hours prior to slaughter.

3. Tack the stomach on a wooden frame to dry for 24 hours in direct sunlight. This will help to rid the stomach of any bacteria or fungus that will cause health hazards.

4. Remove the stomach from the frame, and cut it into squares. 1 square inch of lining will do a gallon of milk so that is a convenient size to make the cuts. Pack in sea salt and apply the lid for later use. Label generously and graphically, and store in the freezer.

5. When you are ready to use the rennet, soak a square in cold water for half an hour and wash gently. Once clean, chop the square as finely as possible or put through the food processor with 1/4 cup of water. Allow the rennet to soak in the water, over night if possible, but at least an hour or two.

**Make Mozzarella** [From UC](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/Mozzarella_American/Mozzarella_American.html)

I followed this recipe but instead of using the powdered Junket(brand name of commercial rennet) tablet, I chopped up 1 square inch of prepared calves stomach and soaked it over night in 1/4 cup of pure water. Where the recipe called for water and Junket, I used the stomach water. It took a lot longer to get a ""Clean Break"" of the curds--about 4 hours instead of 1-2 hours.

Once I got the clean break, the rest of the recipe went completely as any other cheese making. I got about 12 ounces of fresh mozzarella and a lot of whey which I am freezing for later to make [Ricotta Cheese.](http://fiascofarm.com/dairy/ricotta.html)

Wikipedia suggests that Eastern White Pine is the mainstay, and there
are plenty of places to buy seed for this. But many other pines are
apparently used as well, (Yellow, Ponderosa, etc.). Are these only
used because they are available and therefor cheap, or is it because
their characteristics are truly desirable?

Eastern White Pine: http://www.seedman.com/pine.htm

Ponderosa Pine: http://seedrack.com/08.html

Cedars... I'm not even sure if these are technically hardwood or soft.
But definitely something that would be nice to have. Fortunately, I've
found several sources for both Atlas and Lebanon cedar, but have had
little luck germinating either so far. (But, as with pines, it can
take months I'd imagine).

Atlas Cedar: http://www.seedman.com/deerx.htm

Lebanon Cedar: http://seedrack.com/02.html

Now, of the cheaper hardwoods, there are quite a few commonly sold.
Maple, so I've read, is exclusively Sugar Maple. Wikipedia lists a few
dozen cultivars, but I think these are only an issue for landscaping,
they have slightly different appearances.

Sugar Maple: http://seedrack.com/01.html

(I wish this sight would put #location links in the page, but you'll
have to scroll down.)

Haven't tried these yet, though they'll be on my next order.

Then there is cherry, which I'm told is exclusively Wild Black Cherry.
I tend to like this one alot myself, prefer it for floors. Not to
mention, as near as I can tell it should make a basic acceptable
rootstock for fruit trees, if I can ever get it to grow. But no luck
yet. I keep the soil moist, inside where it's warm, but never a single
pit has sprouted.

http://www.seedman.com/prunus.htm

(This site's as guilty as the previous, you'll have to scroll.)

And of course oak. Here, there are two primary lumber species. One,
the White Oak has a color similar to Maple. The other, Northern Red
Oak, isn't quite as dark as cherry, the few places I've seen it. Both
would be nice for furniture and so forth. No links for them, can't
find a place to buy the acorns.

Then, there's hickory. I thought it was only ever used for axe handles
and such, but a few people on Garden Web forums told me it's actually
used in high end cabinetry. Guess that tells you what kind of homes
I've lived in, eh?

Can't find a definitive explanation of which species is preferred.
There is Shellbark Hickory, and then there is Shagbark. Sometimes,
sources will confuse one with the other.

Shagbark: http://www.seedman.com/fruit.htm

I've had no luck germinating these, but as it is a nut with a hard
shell, that might take awhile. No links for seed for Shellbark, only
seems to be places selling saplings for too high of a price.

These would double as a nut tree though, so I'd definitely like to be
able to grow them.

Then, sometimes fruit trees are used for lumber. Apple, pear, even
peach, supposedly. It's usually pretty expensive, somewhere in the
same price are as walnut. Some suggestions I've heard are for
Antonovka for apple, which is also recommended as a generic rootstock
(and, according to some, will have decently flavored apples even if
not grafted).

http://www.seedman.com/fruit.htm

No luck germinating this, either.

If anyone has any other suggestions for varieties to use for lumber, I'd like to hear them.

And then, of course, there is walnut. A dark, beautiful wood. For lumber, this usually means the Black Walnut. Which also has an appealing, if hard to open, nut. I've never really seen anything made from it other than gun stocks, myself.

Haven't found a source for this as seed, yet.

Finally, of historic interest, is chestnut. Until the early 20th century, it was the most common tree in North America, and the tallest on the east coast. Not quite rivalling Redwoods, but not too shabby either at 60+ meters. Then, a fungal disease not unlike the later Duth Elm Disease wiped almost all of them out. For most of us, if we've ever seen the lumber it is only that salvaged from older buildings.

I'll be trying twice to germinate them again this fall, the last batch I had little luck with. I've bought some off of ebay, can't find any place with a proper online web store to link to. Anyway, even if they're not practical to grow for lumber, the nuts will make them worthwhile.

Now, one I'd never heard of myself, but is apparently grown extensively just for lumber is paulownia. Not able to find much about this, and there are several species of it. Supposedly, it can grow up to 10ft per year, and be harvestable in just seven. Wikipedia seems to think that Elongata is the preferred species, but the few places selling this seem to want to gouge. High prices for cloned stock, only sold as small trees. However, if Tomentosa would work, Whatcom has seed for it.

Paulownia: http://seedrack.com/07.html

Of the exotics, I only know a few names myself, and haven't ever really seen them. We've all heard of Ebony and Mahogany and Rosewood... but the latter of those aren't even specific species. And I don't think that they'd be practical to grow unless you live in a jungle.

But there are specialty ""woods"" if you can call them that, too.

Balsa... we've all had the 50¢ airplanes as kids. It'd be useful for other things as well, if growable. I have my doubts, but I did buy some seed. So far, only one has germinated out of about 4. It's a tiny little thing, and it doesn't look like it's doing well. But even if I manage to get it up to a decent size, I doubt I'll put it outside this winter, though maybe next.  We'll see what happens.

Balsa: http://www.seedman.com/tropic.htm

(Note, I bought mine from someone on ebay, before I realized that Seedman had them.)

And then there's cork... the stuff we all know from bottles of wine (for those that haven't switched over to plastic of some sort) is actually the bark of a particular oak tree. Not even sure that counts as wood.

This one is hard to find. Only one place has them, and though for the others I've only bothered to mention seeds, I'll link to the small seedling/sapling source I've found.

I began to be concerned with these sorts of things in the middle of 2007, and by that December I had grabbed a few packs of seeds at Home Depot and a couple of small blueberry plants. I think my harvest for that coming year was a cup of peas, and exactly 1 blueberry. Granted, at the time I was living in a tiny condo and growing plants is difficult under the best of circumstances.

This year we moved right about the time I would have been preparing, so not much of a garden again. But my two banana plants are starting to be impressive... they were pathetic little things when they came in the mail last year, and what little growth they had died back in the winter. This summer though, close to 3ft tall, with each new leaf taking a little over a week and getting close to 18"" in length. Supposedly they are a dwarf fruiting variety, but until that happens who can say? I might even manage to have them do a little growth this winter, as I have a big bay window that faces in the right direction.

I also managed to get the last of my peach pits from http://seedman.com (Montclar) to grow. I started those last September I think. Split the pits open, and planted the seeds directly (they look like almonds if you've never seen them). Little roots pushed out, and then nothing happened. I only just learned days ago this is normal, it's not a real root... and this last one, it splits open and roots grow out of it. It's called a false germ. And, now the thing's almost 10"" tall, full of little leaves.

I've got a few avocado trees too, grown from grocery store pits. Tallest is about 20"". Can't find the scion/bud-wood to graft onto them to save my life... the few nurseries that sell retail only sell the trees themselves.

I've got a couple of jute plants growing (what they make burlap out of). A cotton plant out in the front yard that was probably planted too late to go to seed. One of my jojobas did manage to sprout, though I have no idea what to do with it if it does get big. And another mesquite plant that I'll have to destroy if it gets too big... they're invasive in these parts and I can't let it get out.

The rest is all pretty mundane. A few tomato plants I'm going to try to keep alive through the winter, a few jalapeños. 

Now that I've got a yard of my own, I even want to get some more jatropha curcas seed, and grow one of those larger... I'm curious to see one go to seed, I have my doubts about how easy it'd be to harvest. Or even the purported 350+ gallons of oil per acre of the stuff... that just seems overwhelmingly optimistic.

But even if I have a ranch someday, and I grow a few acres of it and it does give me that much biodiesel, what about all the other disposable parts that go into a car? What about the motor oil? 

This coming spring, if Nashville doesn't outlaw it (there's some zoning council bullshit currently going on) I plan on building a chicken coop and getting a few of them. And, sometime yet this year I will even build a composter of some sort.

Besides that, I've been working on a seed directory website:

http://seedfinder.homedns.org/ 

It's not much, and I haven't loaded it with much yet... but there a few decent sources for orchard trees in there, and the like. Check it out if you're bored. Mostly it's for my personal use, because I'll be searching with Google and find something I'd like to buy and then 3 weeks later can't find where I found it.

What would I need to make sure if something like this happened, I could get up and get the hell out of my house, with my girlfriend, and be ok for a few days - weeks?

I will begin by describing my family and myself.

My Dad: He grew up in Fargo, North Dakota on his fathers farm. He used to tell me about how his Dad would go hunting with him. However, I overheard him once bragging about how his Dad left him in the truck along to go drinking at the local bar until 3am. Anyway, my Dad's father died when he was 14 which resulted in my Dad becoming the school bully. He would pick on kids and beat them up just to make his life feel less like shit. He joined the navy where he was dishonorably discharged for calling his superior a “nigger”. He then moved to California where he met my mother and her daughter, Brittnie (who was 3 at the time). They had sex and had me by mistake.

My Mom: My mother was adopted at the age of 4 days old and taken to live with my Grandma Dorothy (who is technically her adopted mother) and my Grandpa Blaine (he owns a gravestone company called “Valley Monument” if you have ever heard of it) in Pasadena, California. She lived with her 2 brothers Randy (who is a carpenter and heir to the company because he practically runs it and helps it flourish) and Blaine Jr. (who is a complete drug addict to this day and is HIV+ has hepatitis c and b and is a complete nutcase and makes calls to us at 2am about how the Chinese mafia is out to get him). My mother used to be beautiful and was part of the posh crowed. My mother dated a man named Lou and had my sister by mistake and used it as a way to trap him into marrying him (much like my father). She later divorced him after endangering my sister while drunk driving. Lou had to pay an insane amount of child support to her until my sister turned 14.

My Brother:Now people tend to say how I only say this because I am the middle child, so to prove a point I calculated everything we got for Christmas and he literally had over $3000 (xbox console, a brand new computer [which I asked for that year and he didnt], a new car, and a BMX bike. All I got was a vintage NES, 3 games, socks, shirts and some candy. My dad gives him everything he wants because my brother is EXACTLY like my dad in every way. They are both raging alcoholics, are bullies, are mean and nasty, etc etc. Anyway, when my mother was chewing me out and told me that David is setting a good example. I dragged her up to his room and dragged all the 40 ounce budweisers from underneath his bed and pulled up his browsing history (to reveal porn on his newly purchased computer) and my parents said that I planted it on him. He was a C/D average student in high school and they paid for his college with no intent on making him have a job while I was working full time at a steakhouse washing dishes because my parents said I needed to move out (I assume so they could afford to pay for his school). After paying for his school and failing EVERY CLASS for two years they are STILL paying for his courses.

Me: I am a gay atheist . When I was in 3rd grade I had insane migraines that were so painful that I would throw up for hours and scream because it felt like my head was being smashed by a sledge hammer (literally). After going to 9 hospitals and being told there was nothing wrong with me, we went to Phoenix Children's Hospital where (after a cat scan and numerous MRI scans) they found an arachnoid cyst the size of a dime in the middle of my brain. They said I was lucky because if it had gotten any bigger, there would be no telling what could have happened. So I had brain surgery and was left with ADHD, Mild tourettes, and mild short term memory loss. I was constantly bullied (which is why I sometimes offer advice to parents on reddit on how to help) and had no friends. Sure there were kids I would hang out with, but none of them considered me their friend. I found solice in video games because it was the only thing I could do without being mocked or teased (FF9 made my life amazing). When I was 13 I watched my 1st porno and after realizing I hardly watched the woman I realized that I was gay. I did EVERYTHING I could to conceal it. However, I did not realize that the McAfee subscription expired and the computer got infected with a virus that would pop up with a million gay porn pages. My mom discovered it 1st and confronted me about it and I confessed to her. Later when my Dad found out, he came and screamed at me about how he didn't raise me like “that” and why I am just confused. Ever since then he was neglectful and abusive towards myself and I to this day to not forgive him. High School made my life a living hell. I had one friend who was 4 years younger than myself because no one else would talk to me and even his parents hated me because I was not chinese. I was bullied so much that I would boil to a tipping point then I would lash out (one time I hit a kid with a bar stool and tried to stab another kid with a soldering iron in stained glass class). I was always required to sit in the front so that teachers could keep an eye on me and hear kids making fun of me, but 99.99999% of the time the teachers would ignore it and reporting it only made it worse for me. I eventually ended up hiding in the teachers lounge because my bullies would stalk me (this is happening from 2006-2009 mind you). One day, I discovered that the annual gay pride event was coming up and I begged my parents to let me go (when I was 18). I vowed to myself that if I could not come out of there with at least one new friend that I would kill my father and then kill myself when I got home. After running around trying to meet new people I was confronted with either laughter or people asking “why are you talking to me?”. After 5 hours of this I called it quits and walked to the front and asked where a pay phone was from customer service and a guy behind me offered to let me use his phone. I told him that I had to call for a ride and he offered to take me home if I stuck around. After chatting with him, we became great friends and it was the happiest day of my life.

My Dad's side of the Family: Every last one of them are Protestants. And I mean church EVERY day status where they try to ram how being gay is a sin down my throat every time I see them. My grandmother on my dad's side is a total witch. Sure she makes $700,000 on a bad year, but she is extremely mean and nasty and everyone in the family but myself kisses the ground she walks upon. She is drunk all the time (I get a drunk call from her every week) and her drink of choice at 9am is Vodka Tonic. I have tried to tell her about how my Dad is extremely mean and verbally abuses myself and my mom, but she always asks my Dad about it and he tells her I am full of shit (my dad has jabbed me in the throat, slammed my head into the wall and tackled me into dressers numerous times).

My Mom's side of the family:  My grandmother passed away when I was 13 and she was living with a man named Terri (who no one talks to anymore because he isn't related to us and was a total ass hat). My uncles Randy and Blaine Jr. are always fighting (Blaine Jr. throws tomatoes at Randy EVERY chance he gets). Randy is a hard working man who makes a modest living working for my grandfather blaine at valley monument making head stones for cemetaries. My grandfather WILL NOT LOAN MONEY TO ANYONE not even for school or if it would prevent you from being homeless.

The Issue: When my brother failed all of his classes for the semester AGAIN, I figured I would try to swoop in and try and get my Dad to pay for my college instead of David. He said OK like it was nothing (and I figured he was going to borrow money from grandma like he always does). When I told him I needed a place to live he offered to pay for a place until I could find a job. So after paying for my rent and registering and paying for classes he started screaming at me EVERY day on the phone about how I am a lazy piece of shit for not having a job yet (I spend 4-5 hours per day sending resumes, filling out applications and making phone calls). Even at this point if I got a job TODAY I would not get my paycheck in time to pay for rent. I am looking for possible resources to utilize and I feel like I am forgetting something. Here is a list of things that I have tried and can't (or no longer) do/use.

Vocational Rehab: I was referred to Voc rehab by my school's psychologist and when I was there my dad got defensive and told them how I need to be on medication. They told me in order to advance the process that I would need to go back on medications (this is two weeks after my dad took me off of his insurance plan).

Facebook: I have asked EVERYONE on facebook to see if they knew of anyone is hiring. All I ever hear is either unhelpful or impractical because (I can't drive due to tremors I have) I have to ride the bus.
Craigslist: I have tried applying to over 100 positions on craigslist and it always turns out to be a scam to get your personal information, busses can't get me there, they require a driver's license, it's 90% commission based, it's full time, or the bar is SO GOD DAMN HIGH (server positions require at least 2 years of experience 99% of the time).

Jobing.com: Pretty much everything listed on there is a professional job that requires a degree. Usually they require that you own your own car (out of submitting my resume over 200 times and making even more phone calls, I FINALLY got called for a phone interview. As soon as they asked if I own my own vehicle and had a driver's license and I said no, they hung up immediately).

So what I am asking of the redditors here is if any of you guys have any ideas on what I should do. I lack resources and money (I have $20 to my name) and I really didn't want to ask you guys but I have nowhere else to turn. Hopefully I am just overlooking something

My vegetable gardening experience boils down to planting zucchini and tomatoes in a topsy turvy planter, hanging it on my porch, and being ecstatic that I could eat something I grew myself (just like the tv said I could!)

I really want my family to be more self-sufficient, so I'm willing to learn to do more. I have a heavily wooded half acre in the pacific northwest with a cleared 800 sq feet that gets partial sun, if that (when the sun shines). I want to put up a backyard hoop house, a small chicken coop, and a heated green house with grow lights for our long, cold, dark winters.

I also have a 6' x 2' counter in the mud room that gets partial sun that I'd like to try container gardening on... is that enough space for my weekly salad greens?

Here's what I want EVERY WEEK REGARDLESS OF THE SEASON:

- 30-40 baking and sweet potatoes
- 15-20 lbs of baby spinach and all those lettuces found in the packaged ""spring mix"" at the grocery store
- 30-40 tomatoes (or 300-400 cherry tomatoes)
- 15-20 lbs of zucchini, squash, and/or broccoli
- 15-20 medium/large cucumbers
- 3 dozen eggs

Is this possible? How to I even begin to learn how to set this up properly? We can give our garden and chickens about 10 hours of labor a week, is it realistic to think we can produce this much food with ""so little"" commitment?

I'm funding the project and if anyone wants to contribute, feel free. I'm not asking for donations because of the unethical people who beg, scam and steal via the Internet and I don't expect more than your information and feedback. I'll buy a domain and I will set up a github, bitbucket, Google Code and self-hosted SVN respositories as well as a main web site for this project.

I am taking ownership of ideas tossed around here and several forums so that we can get something accomplished. I'm not asking you to contribute information, I'm begging and telling you to contribute because this will be a one-of-a-kind software and we want it to the best it possibly can be. This includes links to wikis, scraped data and guides on farming, ideas for cheap greenhouses and do-able alternative energy sources (biogas, diesel storage, gasoline storage, wind power, solar power).

We need a meals calculator: how much livestock and farmed food, herb and other materials needs to be produced food per person at 3 meals a day plus three snacks per day.

We need a profit calculator: how much of X crop or X eggs need to be produced to make a profit, with the currency, sell price, gross and net values variable based upon custom input information as well as templated.

We need a land calculator: how much of X livestock can be put into X square feet or X acres of land with what method (stacking chicken coops for instance or growing stacked podponics or hydroponic units versus standard planting into soil.) and more.

I want all ideas that would be useful and work on a web (php and html5) and mobile (android and apple embedded devices, as well as limited WAP use) devices.

Other solutions, both commercial, free or open source are useless for all of our needs. I aim to have that fixed. They are either limited (useful for one thing only), cost too much money or are very ugly to deal with (and not mobile).

Here's a general idea so far, not including what's in the reddit threads below.:

Homestead / farming / ranching / garden / land planning and development (and upkeep) estimation (for materials lists, costs, and more) and design software. With a few $1,000+ plugins it's possible to do some of it with $3,000's worth of AutoDesk Software but what's out there is either a) useful for one task or b) cheap and contributed to by one person who does it out of the kindness of their heart but has no time and thus completely lacks features and or costs $50 to $200.
There's nothing but high-priced solutions and open source solutions just don't get enough drive behind them to get a great project going.
Here's a few people (including myself in one of the threads) talking about it. The main things needed are a) web app b) mobile app integration (with to do checklist type function) c) spreadsheet-math integrated templating system for various jobs, materials and cost estimation d) reminders of tasks needing to be done or on to do list. Much of that I know can be done piecemeal with free software but not much can be done all in one place and overall, to do all the tasks needed, it's more challenging of a problem than most people will do and thus do without.

Ideas for plugins or features include a botanical database for food crops, other crops, herbs, trees (for wood resources and fruit harvesting), pest management, tracking egg production in fowl ranching, cheap tracking of tagged livestock (cattle, etc) with a DIY solution, At-Home or On-Site weather station data scraping, a Knowledge-Base for primers or walkthroughs for various tasks if someone forgets it (that will be community built) including animal disease management, hazardous chemicals, plants and animal guides.
Our aim is to create a free piece of software with some pieces of the software being open source to allow modification and development of plugins and to plug-in to existing frameworks such as wikis.
Essentially, we need a web application in HTML5 and PHP so that it is compatible with all recent browsers and also some embedded devices such as Android and Apple devices.

We want to be able to design (graphically like a CAD program), including importing images for us (even if to be traced over in our CAD). We want to be able to estimate materials needed and cost.
We want to be able to estimate amount of water needed and have cut and paste irrigation and watering methods.

We want to be able to use data that's been imported and publish it so that others can use it too (crop planting information for instructions and CAD, including spacing, irrigation, crops OK to plant near one another, pests in a given geographic area, weather in a geographic area, etc).

We want to be able to scrape data from CSV and put it in a database.
The former threads relevant to this are here:

I'll lay out some more information here later, including links to the repositories and an updated-daily (if I have time each day) feature request list, information sources to be scraped (copied and compiled / collated) and progress notes.

Again, anyone who wants to contribute may do so. I guarantee that your information or work will be published and stay published but I don't guarantee it will be open source.

I'm also going to post this elsewhere to gain as much momentum with it as is possible for me to do. I look forward to your submissions and feedback.

1317699185.0,9,self.SelfSufficiency,l04nw,I am calculating whether or not I can afford to live on my own. Please help me fill in the blanks in my budget :),m3thlol,10,1,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/l04nw/i_am_calculating_whether_or_not_i_can_afford_to/,"I'll preface this by saying that this seemed the most logical subreddit to post this in. I'll also lead by saying that I have no immediate interest to move out on my own, however I feel comfortable having a back up plan. I'm currently 22 years old, living with my parents and working full time (36-40 hours a week) as a department manager at a furniture store. My take home is roughly $1200-$1400 a month, never less than $1200. 

The current plan is essentially to bank as much money as possible while my girlfriend attends school. In a year or so she will graduate, and we will move out together shortly after that. I plan to have enough money by then to pay for a two year network administration course that will allow me to continue working full time.

However, as stated. I like to have a back up plan should I find myself out on my own. 

My current monthly estimate of expenses is as follows:

Rent - $600 
In the area I live in there are plenty of bachelor/basement/etc apartments in this price range. Some are filthy, while others are immaculate wonders in the basements of clean families. These often include hydro and water (which is what I'm looking for) sometimes even internet access.

Rent could be severely lowered if I could find a (couple of) room mate(s). Three friends of mine live together in a 2-bedroom apartment in my area and they pay $275 a month each not including utilities.

Food - $150-$200
This is something I have absolutely no idea about, and need the most advice on. I pay my parents $400 a month and eat whatever the fuck I want. This budget would obviously not allow for eating out or home cooked steaks. I'm thinking lots of pasta and PB&amp;J.

Toiletries and other essential supplies - $100
I have absolutely no problem buying my shampoo at the dollar store.

Transportation - $0-$80
I will soon be buying an electric scooter to shuffle me about. This obviously wont work out as well in the winter. I don't own a car, and enjoy taking the bus. The public transit in my area is very efficient and reliable and I can't justify owning a vehicle in my current financial situation.

Internet - $40
Internet in Canada is expensive, and often includes extra charges for high bandwidth use. I found a local company which offers unlimited 10mbps internet for $40 a month.

Phone - $30
I currently pay roughly $60 a month after all the wacky government and administrative costs. If I cancel my data plan and remove all the other pomp and frills with a little bit of haggling I believe I can get my bill down to $30.

Entertainment - Virtually nothing.
I'm a social shut-in with a never-ending torrent queue. I don't go anywhere, I don't do anything exciting and all of my books, video games, television shows and movies are completely free. On occasion I will meet with friends over a few beers and nachos. I'll let that depend on how much spare cash I have.

Bank fees - $15 
I can probably get these lowered.

Grand total = $935-$1050

The fees listed above are what I consider essential. There are obvious extras such as snacks, drinks, random situations that require me to call a cab, social events such as birthdays that I can't get around without looking like an ass hole. I haven't factored in health expenses. I am Canadian so I have free health care, and I also have benefits from work which cover roughly 65% of most of the things that OHIP doesn't. Still, I could contract some sort of odd sickness which requires medication that is expensive.

I've obviously missed a shit load, as these figures make no sense to me. Help me reddit.",,False,self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,True,t3_l04nw,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/l04nw/i_am_calculating_whether_or_not_i_can_afford_to/,

It's very likely that I won't be able to do anything outside, unless the building owner will allow me to put up some hanging baskets (I'll have to check on this). I've done a lot of googling on indoor container gardening and hydroponics set-ups, but almost everything I've found are ""ezine"" or associatedcontent.com articles written by people who don't know what they're talking about. I would appreciate links to any resources on container gardening, hydroponics, varieties of veggies that fare well indoors (especially tomatoes, green beans, various herbs, peppers, and greens). I'd also like to hear success or failure stories from others who have done this as well. Thanks in advance, any help will put me on the path towards self-sufficiency. :)

**Edit**: I'm in Lexington, KY. It's been very hot (low 80s-low 90s) and humid here since about mid-March/early April, and I anticipate that it'll stay that way until September.

**Edit 2**: I'm getting a west facing unit now, hopefully I'll have better success than the north-facing unit.

Cellulose for ethanol's a dumb idea, in my opinion, and I have no intention of using it for that. However, I am curious if it can be burned (and less so if it can safely be eaten by livestock).

I've been wanting a meat grinder for months now... ever since in the obstetrician's waiting area I picked up a cooking magazine and read an article on making chorizo. They made it sound, if not easy, then doable.

Now, Amazon lists some meat grinders for as low as $25 or so. But the reviews on these are invariably critical. They claim that the pieces fit together poorly or that they're prone to rust. More than a few use the term ""chinese junk"". While sometimes it's not possible to learn what it is you need to buy on the first try, this one time I'd really prefer to skip that step.

Does anyone have any recommendations?

This site seems to have alot of useful attachments and plates:

http://harvestessentials.com/meat-processing-meat-grinders-meat-grinder-parts---accessories.html

All of them in stainless. Many of the stuffing attachments found on Amazon seem to be plastic (especially the ones that come with the cheap grinders).

Now, that's not to say that all of them on Amazon seem like junk.

http://www.amazon.com/TSM-Products-Stainless-Steel-Grinder/dp/B002L7X1YM/

This one is made of stainless but is a bit pricey. Certainly not out of the question, but more than I want to spend only to discover it to be crap.

http://www.amazon.com/Bearing-Grinder-Vbelt-Pully-Plates/dp/B002FJBJGI/

This one is cheaper... I wouldn't feel nearly as bad if I bought it and it turned out to be junk. But, there is no manufacturer listed. And it's just chromed, not stainless.

Obviously, I'm ignoring all the motorized ones. I'd like to be able to use this without electricity, and even if I were considering a motorized one I'd not want consumer-grade junk that would fail in a few years and for which parts would be impossible to find.

Any suggestions welcome.

The birds benefited, however. So, this week I put out the jatropha curcas seeds... unsurprisingly, only one was eaten.

I imagine some bird puking up its guts, and it makes me feel a little better.

The jatropha seed was purchased from http://seedman.com . I recommend them, and they have many things you can't get elsewhere. When there have been mistakes in my order, they didn't question or accuse, just promise to fix it as quickly as practical. Do check them out. But the jatropha seed looked old, dried out... and I'm not sure that it is viable. Those looking to do this might be better off purchasing such off of ebay. In the past I had purchased it there, and it didn't look half as bad, and germinated in just a few days. Technically it's illegal to import seed without a permit, and most of the sellers on ebay are from foreign countries. 

I've finally found a source for [guayule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenium_argentatum). I won't be disclosing this source, but they've offered me a small amount. I believe this will be an excessive quantity for my own purposes, and I offer it to whomever might want to try it... private message me for my address, and you can just send me a SASE. This particular line is supposedly more frost-tolerant than typical, suitable my own area (Lubbock, TX). Hopefully it will be easy to grow, and I will be able to offer seed for it on a more continual basis.

If anyone knows anything relevant to making rubber from it, that would be appreciated. I'm particularly looking for chemistry textbooks that might outline a recipe for vulcanizing the stuff (something that explains how to do it on a practical, small-scale basis). But also for books or links that would explain what is involved in harvesting the latex in the first place... it's nothing like Hevea Brasilliensis.

My miscanthus is in the ground, but no shoots yet. It's been two weeks, I make sure the soil is moist but not swamped. Hell, it grew 3 inch leaf shoots in the 2 days I didn't plant it, along with 6 inch white roots out of the rhizome. I haven't seen any digging, and I don't think it'd be very tasty for anything either... so I'm slightly concerned. 

I'm finally in an area where Opuntia cacti will grow well. But I've yet to find a nursery that has any. Still one place left to check though. I suspect that I will have something suitable soon enough... so if anyone could help me locate a source for cochineal insects, I'd greatly appreciate it. In Arizona and other places, they're supposedly a real landscaping pest for those who like to grow this type of cactus.

Also, if anyone is really bored, can you help me determine what would be required for someone to even legally ship these things (should that be required)? Opuntias aren't really an agricultural product, and the bugs don't really use any other plant as a host, they're quite specific. I don't believe they're capable of becoming invasive, but that's only speculation. I've tried reading up on it on usda.gov, but it's not very clear to me.

And I still look for lac (insects) as well, but I can find even less information on those. I doubt there's a source available, let alone a legal one.

Cotton: I'm finally somewhere that I can expect it to grow well. Still researching whether I'm technically allowed to grow it or not... they're kind of pissy about the boll weevil in these parts, and it's somewhat regulated I think. A single acre can yield up to 2800 pounds of cotton though, and even without heavy fertilizer or pesticides it seems like that should be a few hundred pounds... nothing to dismiss. I'd need a small herd of sheep just to get even 100 pounds of wool, and who knows how many acres of pasture. So I'm a little excited about this experiment. 

Anyone know of any sources for machines to process it? I've found http://minimills.net , but it's unclear if their machines would work for cotton (they state that they're for wool).

Also, what are my options for buying a compost bin of some sort, other than ordering online? Tractor Supply Co. seems to have one on the shelf, but it's not very impressive for $130, and I don't care much for plastic. I really want to stop throwing away things that would make good soil, seems like a waste to send them to a landfill.

Finally, if you're doing anything interesting, I'd certainly like to hear more. Let us hear about it.

Not sure if it is pertinent but I run [this Scandia 100 stove](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RuWwObWu2Q0/S0B_yo5I_II/AAAAAAAAAss/pcFSwPQ5vnw/s1600-h/emscandia1003.jpg) which I found for free on the side of the road some years ago and reconditioned it.

(Repost from /r/energy)",NoMoreNicksLeft,17,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/9kdzi/how_much_miscanthus_would_a_person_have_to_grow/,"This is the stuff I'm talking about:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscanthus_giganteus

Rather than growing it for ethanol, what if you were to dump the stuff into one of these?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_digester

The result would be methane, carbon dioxide, and some hydrogen sulfide. Supposing you cook with it, it wouldn't take much there. Heating a home through winter would be a little more difficult though.

For cooking, the best numbers I can find seem to indicate that you'd only use about 2-4 therms per month. (A therm being equal to approximately 100 cubic feet of natural gas. Biogas tends to hover around only 50% methane though, keep in mind.)

For heating, this is very location dependent. In the south, it might only be necessary to heat at all for about 4.5 months though. In fairly cold places, this might be up to 200 therms per winter month. (One place claimed 170 therms in January for a Colorado home.)

Now, if you pipe the methane into a typical generation setup, you're going to need to produce something like 1200 kWh per month (though, some averages in some states are down in the 650-800 range). Finding what a reasonable peak load should be is a bit tougher. Figure though that in summer, some hefty AC might be needed (and if it isn't, then you'll just need that much more for heating in winter).

I'm having trouble figuring out how many therms a person would need per day though, from all of this (the methane powered generator being the most disagreeable, I know little about them). And no one can agree on how many pounds of miscanthus will translate into x therms of gas, either.

Some sources are claiming over 8 tons per acre for miscanthus. But I imagine that summer fresh-cut grass will produce more biogas than will the dried material in winter. And you can't easily produce the methane in summer and store it for winter, either.

Anyone willing to speculate?

It looks like natural gas generators are commonly/commercially available. No need to build your own solution here.

http://www.electricgeneratorsdirect.com/natural_gas.php

However, none of these say anything about continuous opertation either. And am I just doing the math wrong, or are the 48kW units... but 24 hours in a day, 30 days in a typical month means that even at 50% this is 17,000 kilowatt-hours. Enough for over a dozen homes. A dozen not-so-energy-efficient homes, at that.

On that big one though, 50% requires 370 cubic feet of methane though. Nearly 4 therms. With 50% CO2, it would need nearly 750 cubic feet of biogas... per hour. That's alot.

Now, the 10kW generator would be more reasonable here. Still enough for more than one home, or so it would seem (7200kWh at 100%). But even that needs 1 therm per hour to run at 50%. Still alot. (Also, it becomes apparent that you have fuel efficiency gains, the bigger the unit.)

Still haven't found any good sources on how many pounds of material translate into how many cubic feet of biogas.",,False,self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,True,t3_9kdzi,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/9kdzi/how_much_miscanthus_would_a_person_have_to_grow/,

I've liked the idea of rocket stoves for a while now but hadn't gotten to play with any before.  Last night before falling asleep it occurred to me that I ought to make one so today I went to thrift stores to find a tin.  No luck there but I really had a hankering so I went and bought a 6 gallon galvanized steel container with lid, a section of 4"" stovepipe, and a 90° connector.  The insulative material I used inside is vermiculite which I heard is good for this use.  I was pleasantly surprised when it lit easily on the first try.  So here's a couple pictures of it on its first day:

* [I burned those flames high to get a decent daylight picture](http://www.theearthgarden.org/forum/download/file.php?id=2451&amp;mode=view/IMG_8436%20(Large)

* [Our toaster oven recently stopped working and this grate fits the rocket stove nicely](http://www.theearthgarden.org/forum/download/file.php?id=2452&amp;mode=view/IMG_8444%20(Large)

You all who have made one are probably bored at this point but what can I say?  It's all very fascinating/exciting for me.  I'd been thinking about solar ovens for cooking and pasteurizing things recently but since it's often cloudy around here I think the rocket stove might be more of a practical first step.  I probably still ought to make some holes around the top lip of the stove to let more air in and am considering cutting the top of the pipe a little shorter so it's not as suffocated by whatever I put on top of it but it already is working quite nicely!",,False,self,t5_2r0yw,1339023837.0,,,True,t3_uos22,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/uos22/my_first_rocket_stove/,

Location: I'm up in Eastern Ontario and every time I go camping (legit crown land no civilization in site camping) all I can think about it is how I would set up a permanent site to live. Unfortunately, winter comes around every year and rains on my parade when I realize how difficult it would be. My ideas of a better location is the coast of British Columbia but wouldn't be against somewhere in the US if it sounded good. So solutions to this would be, a) foolproof winter plan, b) BC is a good idea, or c) there is a good spot in the US

However, due to the size of my lot, I will not be able to do much more than that.

There's plenty of land for sale within a half an hour of my house.  I'm interested in purchasing some for agricultural and self sufficient pursuits (not moving to the country), but they would need to be things that could be tended to on maybe a weekly basis, not daily.  So I can't be milking goats or anything like that.

I could plant some fruit trees and other permanent crops like blueberries and grapes, but even then with our hot Texas summers it may be challenging to keep them watered.  I thought about cattle, but that didn't seem practical since I lack the necessary ranching equipment (even a stock trailer and truck) and they would require more land to graze than I want to buy.  Chickens would need too much care.  Bees might work; since my wife is allergic I can't have any around the house.

Is this a viable idea, or a disaster waiting to happen?  What kind of projects would be well suited to this sort of arrangement?

Part of my plan involves building a greenhouse.

 Luckily, there are a variety of buildings on my farm that can be used for my projects. Infront of my barn is a foundation of what used to be a chicken coop or pig sty or something to that nature. It is roughly 40 feet long and 16 feet wide, but I will only be using a 22' 8"" x 16' 8"" section to build my prototype greenhouse, with plans to extend it to the rest of the foundation at a later point in time. The foundation is quite old, maybe somewhere around 70 to 80 years, and the concrete is not in optimum condition, but I don't have an extremely disposable income and putting a greenhouse on this foundation would be most cost effective for me, as well as convenient. The foundation is south-facing and receives light from 7am all the way until dusk. Here are some photos of it:

http://imgur.com/a/Q1Set/all

As you can see I still have a lot of clearing and cutting to do, the base has been overrun for about 10 years since the building on top of it was torn down due to structural insecurity.

 Basically all I am looking for is advice. Looking online at greenhouse supply stores is mind-boggling and I don't know where to start. Is there anyone out there that could give me some help on starting this project? I'd be looking for information along the lines of what website to buy my materials off of, what materials I should use (longevity being the most important factor to me), and general information about building a greenhouse. I have done some research into the topic, but overall I am still a novice. Southeastern PA usually has mild winters, so I was planning on using a thermal mass heater for my greenhouse that I could use for the colder winter nights, and possibly rain barrels for water collection. I do, however, have a water line that conveniently already runs to the base of this structure. 

Thanks for your help!

If I wanted to be a survivalist, I'd just ave up $2000, go out and buy a pallet full of them. They'd easily last throughout my own lifetime, and probably plenty for my children as well.

However, I am not a survivalist, and don't want to become one. So...

If one had access to lumber (and was growing more, though harvest is a long time in coming), making a toothbrush handle wouldn't be too difficult. Some mid-level woodworking equipment (no doubt powered by some off-the-grid energy solution) should suffice. Table saw, maybe a belt sander, and I imagine a drill press to put holes in the head.

But after that, I'm stumped.

And don't even get me started on toothpaste.

I'm extremely interested in setting up a self sufficient homestead/commune/ecovillage type thing. I have savings and stuff to use, and know a couple of people interested and could find a few more. I just wanted to ask how feasible this is in the UK, as most similar places I've heard of are in the US or Europe (I know there's religious groups here and there, and squatters in London etc). So here's some thoughts.

My main focus would be on self sufficiency. Firstly with power and water and gradually growing more and more food until total independence, this would take time of course. Solar and perhaps wind power, ground source heat pump, and maybe even hydro power from a river or stream if we're lucky. I've also read that [off grid systems can receive feed-in tariffs](http://midsummerenergy.co.uk/solar-panel-information/GridConnection/OffGrid) for what power they use even when not selling power.

For buildings, I'd want to have a semi-improvised set up of wood or metal sheds, tents, huts, caravans, greenhouses, gardens. I just wonder how planning permission works, and what is allowed, and whether the type of land matters as some sites are advertised as farmland or pastures. Particularly wind turbines on a long mast might be too high?

Finally, a ""legal"" structure. It would be communal/anarchist and have no leaders. But I'm just wondering how it would be paid for, could we each pay a fraction of the cost, or could each person pay monthly into a shared fund for upkeep or something? I suppose there's lots of ways of doing it, I just wondered what people thought. And I guess I'm veering off topic here :P

If anyone has any insight, advice or experience doing this in the UK, I'd love to talk to you. Peace!",,False,self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,True,t3_1jlfbn,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/1jlfbn/advice_and_discussion_for_setting_up_a_self/,

1275169354.0,3,self.SelfSufficiency,c9gxg,Miscanthus and jatropha update: what's going on with my experiment.,NoMoreNicksLeft,10,7,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/c9gxg/miscanthus_and_jatropha_update_whats_going_on/,"Well, out of 8 miscanthus rhizomes planted, only 6 have leaves above the surface. This is expected, of course, you'll never see a perfect germination/growth rate. So far, two are about 14"" tall. The rest are well below 8"" tall... I'm just not impressed. Perhaps it doesn't grow much early, or perhaps the soil/climate isn't right for them (or, I suspect I may have planted them too deep, 6-8"" instead of maybe 2-4"" ?), but this hardly looks like the monster giant that will give you 10 tons of biomass per year.

I had hoped that I might be able to make alot of charcoal for terra preta with it, or that it would be fuelstock for biogas or gassification energy. Hell, I'm even curious if it would make good feed for cattle or sheep (supplemented of course with other feed). But unless a miracle occurs, I don't see how any of these will be practical. I'll of course continue (and maybe expand) the experiment for the next few years, but I don't think I'll pin any hopes on it.

Jatropha... as much as I like http://seedman.com , their seeds were duds (please, do not hold this against them, it's inevitable... and they have all kinds of things you can't find anywhere else). I've bought two packages off of ebay, and both seem to be germinating. I've got one plant that's 4"" tall now.

These I hope to see how practical it would be to make biodiesel from. As noted in the past, I have concerns about how well they'll do through winter here in the Lubbock, TX area. They did get a little snow here the past winter, and there were a few days where the temp was below 20°F. 

A secondary use, if it grows well enough, is as a host plant for the lac insect, the bug that they used to make lacquer from and still make shellac from. No idea where I'll even get this though... or how I'd import it. The USDA permit process takes 6 months or more, and you can't apply for a permit until you've identified the source. Nor are they very helpful in answering questions. If anyone knows where I could get this, it would be appreciated.

Anyway, back on the subject of biodiesel, the more I read the more likely it seems that I'd be lucky to see 150 gallons of oil per acre. And there is no good way to make methanol on a small scale... wood distillation is not something to be approached lightly. Too bad I can't just buy some GM yeast that would ferment the stuff.

I'll post pictures of these later if requested, but neither really look like much.

I think I've managed to germinate the guayule seeds I had acquired. Just a few so far, but I'll be happy even with one. Again, Lubbock isn't the most ideal place, these things seem to like Arizona better... but according to the source I got them from, this strain will tolerate frosts better than others. I've yet to discover any method for someone like me to process it. For those who are unaware, this plant is the only other one used to make any signficant amount of rubber (the first and foremost being the Brazilian rubber tree, Hevea brasilliensis). Seems people who have an allergic reaction to the typical kind can tolerate this better. So, if anyone knows of some old college chemistry textbook that has a recipe for vulcanization, or can point out what kind of equipment is used to grind this plant up and extract latex from it... please do so.

My mulberry trees are starting to look good, but I doubt that they'll be ready to feed silkworms this year. That will probably have to wait until next spring (or later).

My modest little row of cotton: hardly any have come up, and it's probably too late to try again this year.

My modest row of jute: not a single germination. Most likely planted too early (it is a tropical thing, I believe).

Which rounds out everything save wool and flax, and both of those will have to wait awhile, I think.

Thankfully, what vegetables I have planted are doing better than the non-food crops.

Even if we could, what do a bunch of people on the Internet, the least self sufficient infrastructure I can imagine, know about self sufficiency?

So, if we can't truly set out with nothing but our wits and nothing else, what makes someone who gardens, builds their own house, makes their own cheese, etc. more self sufficient than someone who just pays for it.

Another is working with the government to join programs. For example a self-sufficient farmer who also has doctor knowledge enters it and for a set amount of work, there's no tax needs to be paid for that year. Or maybe sign the first-borns into military service for 5 years minimum?

I'm fortunate to be a part of a team that has been asked to produce and promote a Kickstarter video for Earthship Biotecture.  

The project is to build a 100% Self-sufficient community center in Malawi, Africa.  The community center will house integral community necessities, like a school, medical center, food storage, and bank.  During this project we will be working with the people there and teaching them how to duplicate this structure so we can empower the community there to the path of self-sufficiency, reducing their need for outside intervention.  

I'm not asking for you to donate, although that would be awesome.  What I am asking, is that you check out our video, and help us spread it amongst your circles of friends and peers.  I know that if we get this project in front of the right set of eyes it will take off.  Will you help us in spreading awareness of our project? A Facebook post, blog post, tweet, or email could be the link we need to reaching the right people.

If any of you have any questions about this project I will be available to answer them here.  Thank you for your time and I hope you find this project as amazing as I do!

And boy do they pop. It looked like all of them were splattered... maybe a few survived. I hope. I guess I'll find out in a few weeks or months.

I'm still looking for a source for the lac bug, domestic or foreign, if any of you guys can help.

My miscanthus isn't doing so good... out of 8 rhizomes, only one has sprouted above ground. I know it's not too cold, and I'm watering. So either I buried them too deep (6-8""), or they're just sissy plants. So far I'm not impressed.

Now, I've got a dozen or so loofah plants in the ground, and 30-40 cotton plants. I expect both of those to do fairly well. I also planted some jute seeds, but I have no idea how well those can do. About the only fiber I won't be trying this year is silk and wool... those take a little more preparation.

I've finally found a source for Ceylon (real) cinnamon. But without a greenhouse, I don't know what I can expect out of that.

Through no fault of our own. We want to live in a community focusing on the sustainable and be safe and dry, as well as eat. These are all that we ask. Please read below for more details. Thank you. If you can help, please PLEASE PM me. 

My name is Ashley, and my wonderful fiancee , Andrea, and myself are going through what I can only describe as hell. To clarify, I'll start from the beginning. During the end of last year we made a decision to leave the economic system and dedicate ourselves to working the land, learning skills that would enable us to sustain ourselves independent of the major consumerist society,  and perhaps building and/or finding a community of like vision along the way.  Along the way, we discovered that there is a network of intentional communities, sustainable communities etc. We thought this would be the perfect answer to the problem of finding land in a market that is set up to eat consumers alive. So, we set forth on the task of communicating with these communties, getting an idea of ideal locations, and people we'd like to live with or work with. In the process we decided that we would head south, to Puerto Rico, which is optimal land agriculturally speaking, and set out to discover what we could find there. We found a few communties and made all the arrangements, bought the plane tickets, gave up our home, almost everything we owned, and set out on the road on Christmas day.

Along the way, we began running out of money, because as plans go, most of them changed or didn't work out, which, as very fluid people, we dealt with as situations arose, without much stress or fretting. We happen to be extremely easy going and face any situation with a sense of trust that the Universe has plans that we agree have a much larger purpose.  Having gotten so low on money, my father in Atlanta, was kind enough to give us enough to keep us going, which was enough to help us continue on to Tampa, where we visited my sister. Please keep in mind that we began travel from Indiana. We booked our tickets to leave from Ft. Lauderdale, Fl, as they were extremely cheap, plus it gave us a chance to get some travel in.  Tampa was a lovely experience for the most part, I was able to work here and there to keep some funds coming in. We were able to stay with a pretty cool community there, which gave us some insight as to different styles that people implement to organize.

Spending time with my sister was great, but it was also a huge test in people's preconceieved notions of how life should be. She's the type that needs structured plans to go along, and we just don't operate in that manner. The result was it was made apparent that a person's plans – in this instance – is more important than our lives. Literally. Because of these “plans” we were left in dangerous situations, one after another without any empathy or seeking to understand our point of view. Everyone, even at this point, has been willing to point fingers at us, saying we must abide by their rules – dogmatic and antiquated as they are – or die, get mugged, get raped, or so on. Not only with my sister, but with the community we were trying to stay with at the time. We had to jump between places for no other reason than peoples' plans. If it were a trust issue we wouldn't have been allowed in the house. We wouldn't have been allowed to stay while they were sleeping. Yet, as soon as they are conscious, these people find their plans (which are subject to change at every moment) more important than us being safe. We are tired of people putting us in danger over bullshit. Whether it is because we're gay, are a happy functioning couple, intelligent, open minded, or willing to help at all times, we are unsure. 

It seems that people dislike us and don't want to work with us simply because there's nothing wrong with us. We merely want to live a sustainable lifestyle outside of the economy – the same as these people – supposedly. 

From my Sister's house we decide it is best to use whatever money we have to get away from the situation. We catch the Greyhound to Ft Lauderdale. There we wait for half a day to find some way to get to the airport. There we stay for two and a half days waiting for our flight. We barely manage to get on due to some fine print baggage rules. Andrea ended up having to beg everyone to help and finally her uncle does. He pays for our bags then promptly turns off our only means of communication once we're in a strange land. We still do not know why suddenly this was decided by him, having been given no reason. 
Then we arrived in San Juan, again, stranded. We find out from both of the communities that we made contact with that they cannot take us. The one woman, Margo, was just rude, uncaring, and unreasonable about our entire experience. Even though she made promises to us. We were the ones stranded and she said that this was an inconvenience to her. The second, S. Davis, decided we were not worth picking up from the airport, at least for a small while – only an hour away at that – and told us basically we were shit out of luck and to find a shelter, church, etc We made plans with her as well, sent our itineraries and everything to these people. MONTHS IN ADVANCE ON BOTH COUNTS we made these plans.

They fucked us completely.

So, desperate, we look for someone to at least get us out of San Juan. We are two young, attractive lesbian women. Outside of an airport with our baggage. You can imagine the time we had and how we felt, perhaps. We find one person willing to come get us. He does, easily. Now we're here about to get kicked out again after we've given this family of three : a man named Don, mother Ana, and a young girl (8), all of the solutions to their problems. That's no lie. We literally, by existing and being here, have given them solutions to all of their problems which for some reason they refuse to accept under false pretenses. 

They knew we had no money. They knew we were houseless. They knew we wanted to live sustainably. They knew we were gay and young. 

It almost seems like everyone is trying to attack us simply because there's nothing mentally wrong with either of us. We just want to be away from the system that has literally destroyed everything we once had.

They're only “excuse”, if you can call it that, is that we ran out of money. The same thing ALL of us are trying to live without. This family has so many projects, so much to do, they simply need young minds and bodies to help them get it done. Money is not an issue. We've talked with them about selling their products, as well as our own, over the net. We've also talked with them about getting jobs. We have expended all our rational thoughts towards these people only to practically get an “Uh” in return. 

With all that being explained it needn't be said we are sick of people putting our lives in danger over nonsense. And not regular nonsense, but nonsense that can be solved. 

Now we are looking for yet another place to stay in which we can implement such things. We are telling you our story, as it has happened to us, for help. I simply want to keep the both of us safe.
