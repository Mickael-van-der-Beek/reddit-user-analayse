I've been working on this little side project of mine for the past month or so since I thought I could make a good contribution to this subreddit so here it is.

I'm currently setting up the new flair icons so you guys will have to go ahead and re-assign yours once I'm done implementing all of them. I've done quite a lot of them and there will be some surprises in the future with those which I think you guys might enjoy.

One important thing to note, if you encounter any bugs or issues with the new design, feel free to send me a PM and make sure to specificy which browser you're using as well as the version (a screenshot doesn't hurt either if you can).

I guess that's about it from me, thanks to /u/iw3z for letting me redesign this and most importantly, enjoy.

GO BULLS!

**EDIT**: I forgot to mention one of the new feature of the subreddit which is a little bar at the top for links to official ""game threads"" for people to discuss the game as it progresses as well as a themed boxscore, like so:

#### Example

TEAM|Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|FINAL
:-|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
[](#BULLS) Chicago Bulls|19|17|29|27|**92**
[](#HEAT) @Miami Heat|12|22|21|32|87  

Pretty silly of me to forget mentioning it, done and done :D

Jimmy's stature has risen throughout this season because of his play and his attitude, and I feel that Rose's has sunk because of his lack of play and the strange distance he (and his family) has created with the fans.

Maybe all will be forgotten whenever Rose steps back on the hardwood, but at the very least this season has allowed Jimmy a greater share of the spotlight than he ever would have gotten if he had shared the stage with Rose.  Maybe it's more Jimmy's benefit than Rose's loss.  And let's be honest, we all just want to see what it looks like when the two of them play extended minutes together for the first time.

**Derrick Rose Era**

With only a 1.7% chance of winning the 2008 NBA Draft Lottery the Chicago Bulls won and selected Derrick Rose first overall. The Bulls made the playoffs the next two seasons led by a core of Rose, Luol Deng, and Kirk Hinrich. In 2009 the Bulls faced the defending champion Boston Celtics. In game 1 Rose dropped 36 points. This set the record for most points scored by a rookie in his debut playoff game. The Celtics eventually beat the Bulls in an exciting 7 game series that set the NBA record for most overtimes in a playoff series with 7. The next season the Bulls lost to the No. 1 seed Cavaliers and in 5 games. In May of that year head coach Vinny Del Negro was fired. In early June longtime Bull Kirk Hinrich was traded to the Wizards along with the 17th overall pick Kevin Seraphin for the rights to Vladimir Veremeenko. While the current Bulls era began with drafting Derrick Rose, the hiring of Boston Celtics assistant Tom Thibodeau made the team what it is today. Thibodeau agreed to a three-year contract in late June. Carlos Boozer, the Bulls big name free agent acquisition, was signed to a five-year $80 million contract that summer. Led by MVP Derrick Rose, a core of Luol Deng, Joakim Noah, Boozer and a bench affectionately called the [Bench Mob](https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcROFZX6arMWz4JHEAKky0yGyC9nAGhNfQgiM1yRJAO8rthJ4EgW) finished with an NBA best record of  62-20 in the 2010-2011 season. After making the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 1998 the Bulls lost in 5 games to the Miami Heat. The 2011-2012 season was injury plagued for the Bulls. Newly signed Richard Hamilton and Derrick Rose faced nagging injuries all season. Key contributor C.J. Watson and Luol Deng also missed several games. The Bulls still managed to finish with a 50-16 record good for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls faced the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round of the playoffs. Although the Bulls won the first game 103-91 the game ended in [tragedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo1UlzDeY-o). With Derrick Rose out and Joakim Noah spraining his ankle in Game 3, the Bulls eventually lost the series 4-2. That offseason the Bulls brought back former player Kirk Hinrich, and signed Nate Robinson, Marco Belinelli, and Nazr Mohammed

**2012-13 Regular Season Summary**

[2012-2013 Starting Lineup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysLfnIWF0r8)

*Bullets of key instances of the 2012-13 season. 1-4 sentences, keep it short and to the point and give an overview of the ups and downs of 2012-13. 5 to 10 of these mini paragraphs*

* Expectations were mixed for this season. Some fans thought this season was a lost cause and that we had no chance due to Rose’s injury. Others expected a solid playoff team.

* We ended 3 big streaks this year. The Knicks’ 13 game winning streak, Miami’s 27 game win streak, and who could forget the Bobcat’s 18 game losing streak.

* Derrick Rose's injury was a constant source of drama all season. The media and fans were constantly wondering will he or won't he. Fans had a split opinion over the issue, but most agreed that we just wanted an answer. 

* The emergence of Jimmy Butler and the Joakim Noah becoming an All-star give Bulls fans a reason to be excited for the future.

* Nagging injuries for Luol Deng and Noah were a constant worry during the season. Some feel that their injuries were only made worse by the amount of minutes Coach Thibs played them as both were in the top 15 in [MPG](http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/assists/sort/avgMinutes).
 Some fans also speculate that Noah's [shoes](http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/outside-shot/Chicago-Bulls-Joakim-Noah-Le-Coq-Sportif-199856811.html) are the reason for his troubles.

* Overall the team missed 113 games due to injuries. In addition to Deng and Noah, key players Richard Hamilton and Kirk Hinrich were often injured.

* Nate Robinson proved to be one biggest steals of the off season. He put up 13.1 PPG and 4.4 APG on a vet minimum contract. He also performed phenomenally in the playoffs, averaging 16.3 PPG.

* In my opinion it was a great season to be a Bulls fan. Although we didn't get too far in the postseason, we had plenty of exciting moments. This years team felt closer to fans than they ever had before. Although it was sad to Nate Robinson and Marco Belinelli sign elsewhere this off season, it's great to see them get deals that they deserve. 

* We ended the season with a 45-37 record good enough for the 5th seed in the Eastern Conference. 


**Playoffs**

*[Recap of playoffs, in bullet format. One bullet per series. 5-7 sentence summary. If team was not in playoffs delete all of below and leave ""TEAM DID NOT PARTICIPATE""]*

* *1st Round: (5) Chicago Bulls vs (4) Brooklyn Nets* 
 The Bulls faced the 4th seeded Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the playoffs. They lost the first game of the series but won the next three. Game 4 took 3 over times to complete. Nate Robinson went off for 34, 29 of them coming in the 4th quarter or later. Kirk Hinrich was injured in Game 4 with a bruised calf and missed the rest of the playoffs. The Bulls lost the next two games tying the series at 3-3. In game 6 Nate Robinson was sick with flu like symptoms, and Luol Deng was out with a [life threatening reaction](http://www.suntimes.com/sports/21647319-579/spinal-tap-turned-into-a-nightmare-for-luol-deng.html) to a spinal tap. In Game 7 the Bulls won 99-93, with Joakim Noah and Marco Belinelli both dropping 24 points. 

* *ECSF: (5) Chicago Bulls vs (1) Miami Heat* 
 The Bulls were ready to play when they met the Miami Heat at American Airlines Arena. The Bulls beat the out of sync Heat (they had eight days off), outscoring them 35-24 in the fourth quarter. The Bulls then proceeded to have their collective ass handed to them in the next three games losing by an average of 23 points. The final game wasn’t as bad losing 94-91. Emotions were very high this and there were a lot of moments that in hindsight are [pretty]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTlLmiNvKbM) [funny](http://dimemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/joakim-noah-ejection.png).

**2013-2014**


2013 Draft | Position | Pick(From) |
:--- | :--- | :--- |
Tony Snell | SF | 20th (New Mexico) |

Tony Snell often draws comparisons to his former high school teammate Kawhi Leonard. I think I would be speaking for all Bulls fans but we would be ecstatic if Snell came close to being that good. Snell will not be the rebounder that Kawhi is but he is the epitome of a 3 and D player. He shot 39% from three in his junior year and he performed well in the summer league as can be seen [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzSU-NY52o4) His defense was very good in college, and hopefully Thibs can turn him into an elite NBA defender. He has great length standing 6’7” with a 6’11” wingspan, but he needs to add some weight to guard bigger competition. While he is listed as a SF some see him projecting into more a guard. Either way he brings great versatility, defense, and most importantly shooting to the Bulls. I was not a very big fan of this pick when it was made (I wanted a backup C for Jo) but the more I see the more I like Tony Snell.

Erik Murphy | PF | 49th (Florida) |

Every team needs one. That tall guy that shoots threes. If he makes the team (he probably will due to our money situation and he isn’t that bad) he will fill that role. A phenomenal shooter in college (shot 45.3% as a senior) Murphy could be a decent role player. He does lack athleticism and length which will hinder his defence in the NBA. His shooting is all that matters though as the Bulls are in desperate need of it.

**Expectations**  

/u/awesomeoisawe45 : Expectations for the Bulls are high, and I am hoping that we compete for a top three seed. If Derrick Rose can return to even a semblance of his former self the Bulls will have a very dangerous team. Even though we only signed one player in the offseason it was a big signing. Mike Dunleavy is a better overall player than either of the three-point specialists that we had before (Korver and Belli).  Next year the Bulls will thrive on versatility with Hinrich, Butler, Dunleavy, Snell, and Gibson all being able to play multiple roles. With 3 players who have made All-Star teams in addition to Rose, role players like Hinrich, Dunleavy, and Gibson, and young players like Jimmy Butler and Marquis Teague the Bulls have one of the best teams in recent memory.   
If injuries become a problem the Bulls may struggle. The bottom half of the bench is not as deep as it has been in past years. Hopefully young players like Marquis Teague, and Tony Snell can step up and play a role on the team. Nazr Mohammed was a non factor for most of last year but later in the season made an impact. hopefully now that he has had another year to learn the teams schemes he can play a bigger role backing up Jo. I think a championship isn’t out of the question but we have to stay healthy and still have to get by the very tough top half of the Eastern Conference.

/u/wjbc :  The Bulls have great potential this year, but they also have a scary downside. They aren't ten deep, but their top eight (Rose, Butler, Deng, Boozer, Noah, Hinrich, Dunleavy, Gibson) can cover every position. The biggest concern is Nazr Mohammad, particularly if Noah has foot problems again, that's why the Bulls were looking for a center all summer. It seems like they will have to settle for another forward, and maybe not the experienced vet they want.
So if everyone stays healthy, Rose returns stronger than ever with an improved three point shot and foul shot, and Butler continues to improve, the Bulls could contend for the best record in the league. But if not everyone stays healthy, Rose is hobbled, or Butler regresses, well, that's another matter.
Most Bulls fans want to focus on the upside, but perhaps it's not worth going for the best record in the league, perhaps Thibs can learn something from Pops. 55 games seems like a reasonable goal, it could be 60, or 50. If the starters are healthy anything less seems unlikely. But make no mistake about it, the Bulls want to contend this year, they wouldn't be over the salary cap otherwise. There are going to be some changes next summer, so this may be the last chance for this group of players, particularly Boozer and Deng.

**Anyone else have expectations to add?**

**Should I do more players?**

**Any Changes?**

**Game Updates**

1st 7:00 - Heat are 0-7

2nd 12:00 - Lowest 1st for the Heat this season.

2nd 4:19 - Nate Robinson is out to the locker room. Went after a ball and collided with James. NAte got up with a bleeding lip. 

2nd 0:45 - Nate update! He has a laceration on his upper lip.

2nd 0:00 - Time is up! Bulls are hustling for every play. Hope it continues through the next 24 minutes. Few things, James has his lower shooting half of the season 1-6. But i rather not get excited about that. It can change within 12 minutes. 

3rd 12:00 - Nate is back!

3rd 7:19 - [J. Noah coast to coast video!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U19kQKXsgJ4&amp;feature=youtu.be)

4th 10:11 - Lebron is 3/3 in this quarter. Fuck!

4th 5:38 - See, this is why i hate the refs. Taj did something like this in the game series where he jumped up after a call. Straight up technical. Wade does the same, and screams at the ref. No technical. Am i the only one? 

4th 3:45 - Bulls take the lead!

4th 3:07 - Nate commits his 5th foul. He really could have avoided giving that. We need Nate on the floor. Bold move!

4th 1:18 - Nate with jump shot puts the bulls up by 2. We really need to resign this guy. It would be a huge mistake if we dont. 

4th :45.5 - Need i say more about what i just said? Nate is the man in the quarter. 

4th :24.6 - Crowd is stunned. Along with the body language of the heat now. Seems like this game is over boys. Heat in their Final timeout.  

4th :9.3 - Suck it heat, suck it!

4th 0:00 - Bulls take one in South Beach.

as a middle-aged Pistons fan, my history as a Bulls-hater is long.  it wasn't possible to deny Jordan's greatness growing up--fans everywhere loved watching him.  you're dealing with something spiritual at that point.  it was a source of pride to beat him en-route to getting championships.  it was a source of pride to hear him say that beating Detroit was a milestone in his Championship career.  

(we may have liked Jordan, but we hated Bill Cartwright.  maybe a great role player, but a free-throw shot that made you angry.  YOU HAVE NO BUSINESS MAKING THAT SHOT MR. CARTWRIGHT!)

this season.  amazing win streak of Bulls victories over my Pistons.  the Pistons play good enough to win a couple of the last few, but can't close out, and fall in the end (f*** off, n8--you think you're such a badass).  

first game i get to take my son to this season (he's a rabid basketball fan--not necessarily just Pistons...to my chagrin, he has recently been gifted a ROSE jersey) is the last game between the two, and Detroit wins.  felt great even knowing we were not going to the playoffs, and were heading into an off-season filled with uncertainty.  beating the Bulls was the best thing that could have happened to a Pistons fan at the time given the circumstances.

anyway, season ends, Pistons are out, and we see the Bulls, vastly undermanned, facing the Miami Heat.

i like LeBron James.  i don't see his moving to Miami as a 'strength' in his lore.  but i understand it.  and i feel it doesn't put him in the villain column by default.

but, as a fan of basketball, i want the Chicago Bulls to win this matchup and beat the Heat.  the fans deserve it more, the team deserves it more.  the Bulls can win this if they bring that swagger and physicality that defines them.  this team needs to emulate Nate Robinson's mentality and simply exert their will.

What happened to loyalty? What happened to compassion? Why is our MVP, the player who couldn't leave his house for days when he lost the ECF, the guy who broke down in tears talking about violence in our city, the scapegoat for this team? Because he doesn't feel ready to play? Because he isn't ready to play? Because your fat ass doesn't get to see him for another 3 months? What the fuck does he owe you? Why should he risk the rest of his career for this season? You know, just because there's no chance of re-injury doesn't mean he's ready to play in the NBA.

I've learned a lot about this team's fan base in the past few months. I've learned just how easy it is to turn on our star player for selfish reasons. Reading the message boards, the threads, ESPN comment section, and even this subreddit, I can't believe some of you can call yourselves Bulls fans. It disgusts me. 

I know this is going to get down voted. I really don't care. But just know this: next year, when Rose is putting up MVP numbers, leading this team to a championship, just remember that when he was at his lowest point, he couldn't count on you to give him a break. You called him a ""selfish superstar"" questioning his hear and integrity. Remember that you, his hometown fan, don't have really have his back. You just like to say you do.

Derrick in practice Monday or Tuesday is going against Jimmy and Deng like they're Wade and lebron because thibs is trying to emulate how the Heat might guard point guards, and he's just draining shots over them thinking about '11. Then Nate is hounding him like he's that little bitch chalmers and he double-crosses, blows by him, exploding off his left foot for the vicious slam over Boozer, and then he realizes he wasn't thinking about anything (what knee?) but beating the heat the whole time. then tells the team ""I'm ready."" Thibs lets him know after practice ""I'll let you make the announcement."" D tweets ""i'm back"" comes back better than mvp form (ssj2) and now is ssj3. Noah also comes back (all-star, ssj1). They win out the rest of the year and grab the third seed ([Fuck the Knicks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZZUMjoxfZA)). Bulls breeze through the first two rounds of the playoffs ([pacers who?](http://i.minus.com/ipursZ5hkYOc7.gif)) then play the Heat in round 3. Rose and Noah do the fusion dance, becoming Derrickim Roah, a 6'11'' point forward all-around machine, posting the playoffs' first ever quadruple double and a series average of 40-12-11-5-2. I didn't get to the finals yet.

1366814674.0,39,self.chicagobulls,1d0fhw,Bill Simmons trade speculation for Kevin Love to the Bulls this summer,karma4444,47,8,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1d0fhw/bill_simmons_trade_speculation_for_kevin_love_to/,"[Full article](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9203345/nba-trade-value-part-2)

What should you do if you're Minnesota? If you're smart, you'd build around Rubio (about to get an extension), Pekovic (about to get paid) and whatever you can get for Kevin Love. The blueprint: In February 2011, the Jazz shrewdly dealt Deron Williams 17 months before he could bolt Utah for a high lottery pick (Derrick Favors) and a future lottery pick (that became no. 3 overall: Enes Kanter), maximizing any and all leverage they had. I don't see how the T-Wolves make it through this summer without doing the same. The likeliest suitor? Chicago. The Bulls have big contracts to make the trade work (Luol Deng on the enticing side, Carlos Boozer on the less enticing side); they're loaded with assets like Jimmy Butler (no. 49 on this year's list), the rights to Mirotic (a high lottery pick if he entered this year's draft), and the rights to Charlotte's future no. 1 pick (top-10 protected in 2014, top-eight protected in 2015, unprotected in 2016); and they're a big-market contender with a superstar in house (so they could keep Love for the long haul).

Let's say Chicago calls Minnesota in June and offers them Boozer's contract with Butler, Mirotic AND the Charlotte pick. How could the T-Wolves turn that down? And if you're the Bulls, how would you turn down the chance to (a) dump Boozer's deal, and (b) upend a potential Miami dynasty with a nucleus of Rose, Noah, Love, Deng, Taj Gibson and Tom Thibodeau these next few years? You know, unless your owner was too cheap to make a real run at the Heat? (Cut to every Chicago fan grimacing.) Anyway, I'm dropping Love to 20 only because that Bulls trade made too much damned sense. It just did.",,False,self,t5_2s3uz,False,,noah-home,True,t3_1d0fhw,http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1d0fhw/bill_simmons_trade_speculation_for_kevin_love_to/,

1374295253.0,38,self.chicagobulls,1ioghx,The myth of Coach Thibs not wanting to play rookies.,TLCplLogan,48,10,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1ioghx/the_myth_of_coach_thibs_not_wanting_to_play/,"So, I've been hearing a lot about Coach Thibodeau not wanting to play rookies very much and I decided to investigate. 

Since Coach Thibs took over the team in the 2010-11 season, the Bulls have had three rookies on the team:

Omer Asik in 2010-11, Jimmy Butler in 2011-12, Marquis Teague in 2012-13.

During his rookie season, **Omer Asik** played in all 82 regular season games and averaged 12.1 MPG. That's a pretty good amount of playing time for a rookie backup center, but Asik had a lot of experience playing pro ball in Europe, so he was a little more prepared than your average NBA rookie.

During his rookie season, **Jimmy Butler** played in 42 regular season games and averaged 8.5 MPG. There are two things you have to remember when considering the lack of playing time that Jimmy got as a rookie:

1. As a result of the NBA lockout, Jimmy and all other rookies were not able to participate in the Summer League or a normal training camp. This led to many rookies being unprepared for playing in the NBA, as they had very little time to be with their teams from the time the lockout ended to when the season began.

2. Jimmy had four guys ahead of him on the depth chart this year. He had Luol Deng and Kyle Korver ahead of him at the SF position, and Rip Hamilton and Ronnie Brewer ahead of him at the SG position.

In his rookie season, **Marquis Teague** played in 48 regular season games and averaged 8.2 MPG. I think we can all agree that Marquis was not ready for big NBA minutes, even with a Summer League and regular training camp under his belt.

From all this information, we can see that when Coach Thibs has a rookie like Omer Asik on the team who is ready to play good backup minutes, he is not afraid to play them. When he has rookies such as Jimmy Butler and Marquis Teague that are not ready for good backup minutes and/or have too much talent ahead of them on the depth chart, Coach Thibs will not play them. 

I believe that Tom Thibodeau is a lot better at playing rookie talent than we give him credit for, but hasn't been given good opportunities to play rookies, with the exception of Omer Asik. Next year, Tony Snell should get a good amount of backup minutes at both SG and SF, and Erik Murphy should probably get the same amount of minutes that Jimmy and Marquis did during their rookie years, due to his lack of readiness and the talent ahead of him on the depth chart.

TL;DR Coach Thibs plays rookies when he can, but has only had one good opportunity to do so.",,False,self,t5_2s3uz,False,,drose-red,True,t3_1ioghx,http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1ioghx/the_myth_of_coach_thibs_not_wanting_to_play/,

I firmly believe that Thibs is on the way to becoming a Pop level coach and I think he is good enough to put together an offense as elegant as the spurs.  Seeing how we've drafted and developed players these past few years makes me really optimistic to see how our team develops in the future and I think we can become a ""system team"" like the Spurs are now.

How do you want to see the Bulls develop in the future?  To be honest I don't want to trade for superstars and I would rather see us develop players and follow the Spurs model of team building.  If we can land a good backup center in the draft (Dieng, Whitney) I think we are on track to start developing our depth again and are in very good position in the future.  Rose's return is looking good and Noah and Deng are entering/are in their primes so we can make a run for the championship, but we also have Teague and Butler developing possibly alongside a new young center, and we have Mirotic coming over who has superstar potential coupled with a possible #1 pick from the bobcats in 2016.  Things look super bright for us and I don't agree with the blow up the team for a superstar idea that's going around right now.

My new piece of evidence for his C.O.Y is the recent Joakim Noah story.

He's a fan favorite, grind-it-out hustler,all-star center. With Luol and Derrick out, he's our best player. So when Thibs pulled him out in the Memphis game, I was a little worried about the result. I mean, here's this guy who goes all-out every night, then gets benched for being emotional and a little aggressive. I would personally be pissed if I were him.

 But since that little incident, Joakim has been working even harder, it seems. I commend the dude for being the guy he is, and being motivated by the benching. But it takes some serious cajones for Thibs to do that with confidence. That shows a coach who truly knows his personnel. That shows a coach who values the team more than his superstar. It's the difference between him and Spolstera, and it's the difference between The Bulls and most other teams.

1367777629.0,28,self.chicagobulls,1dqpyj,Some Bulls and Rose love from Bill Simmons:,wjbc,28,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagobulls/comments/1dqpyj/some_bulls_and_rose_love_from_bill_simmons/,"Love for the Bulls in [part 1 of Bill Simmons' latest article](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9239005/thirty-questions-part-1):

&gt;**Q: In the words of the great philosopher Moses Malone, can the Heat go Fo' Fo' Fo' Fo'?**

&gt;If Brooklyn beats Chicago in Game 7, it's definitely in play. And if the Celtics somehow knock out the Knicks, too, it's DEFINITELY in play. But I think the Bulls will beat Brooklyn in Game 7, which means Miami isn't going Fo' Fo' Fo' Fo' — that's not happening on Tom Thibodeau's watch.

&gt;(Tangent: In general, I'm tired of underestimating the Bulls — I did it all season, I did it on the night Miami was going for no. 28, I did it after watching Noah hobble around in Game 1 against the Nets. Every time I cross them off, I get burned. They're exceptionally well coached, they're as tough as anyone, they know exactly who they are — a crucial wrinkle, because you absolutely have to have an identity by May and June — they care about one another and they have immense pride. They carry themselves like former champs even though they haven't won a title yet. That's the highest praise you can give a team. And that's why I think they'll win Game 7 in Brooklyn.)

And sympathy for Rose in [part 2 of Bill Simmons' latest article](http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9239387/thirty-questions-part-2):

&gt;**Q: Can you hold it against Derrick Rose for not coming back?**

&gt;Absolutely not. See, Gilbert Arenas affected the NBA in four ways …

&gt;1. He's the first NBA star who tapped into the potential of connecting with fans on the Internet (with his groundbreaking Agent Zero blog). Then Twitter happened, and Facebook, and Instagram, and now we're at a point where Kobe could run for president because he's so good at social media. In fact, I think I'd vote for him in 2016. As long as he wasn't running with Dwight Howard.

&gt;2. After he bolted Golden State for the Wizards, they named a rule after him — the Gilbert Arenas provision, which makes it easier for teams to sign their own restricted free agents who were second-round picks.

&gt;3. They also named three unwritten rules after him: ""Don't bet large sums of money with teammates during poker games on chartered flights,"" ""Don't bring guns into the locker room for any reason,"" and ""Don't give someone a massive nine-figure contract if you're not positive he's healthy.""

&gt;4. He's the all-time ""came back too soon"" cautionary tale for anyone who suffered a major knee injury. Gilbert tore a meniscus near the tail end of the 2006-07 season, came back too soon, reinjured it in November, missed much of the season, came back too soon a second time, reinjured his knee in the playoffs, came back too soon the following fall, had a third surgery, and ended up playing 15 games total in two years. Make no mistake — he was NEVER the same.

&gt;Now? He's a cautionary tale, the name that floats through the head of any player who wants to keep pushing himself to play, feels really good … but doesn't totally trust his knee yet. Magic Johnson's biggest professional regret is coming back too soon during the 1981 season. He knew his surgically repaired knee didn't feel right, but as Magic tells it, you start feeling that pressure from every direction. Fans, teammates, coaches, the owner, you name it. And it's not even intentional. Might even be something as simple as someone saying, ""How's the knee feeling?,"" only they make eye contact for an extra second and you start thinking, Does he not believe me? You get in your own head. You feel guilty all the time. Your confidence is shaken. You can't do the one thing that always came easiest to you. So you start pushing yourself to come back, tricking yourself, convincing yourself to feel a certain way. And that's when you can get in trouble.

&gt;As Magic put it, When you're ready, you know. If you're wondering even a little? Then you don't know. I think that's where Derrick Rose is right now. He's in his own head. He doesn't totally trust his knee yet. His hammies still hurt. And yet … he feels horrible that he can't help his team. So he's vacillating, and fortunately, GILBERT ARENAS keeps flashing through his head in all caps. Over everything else, that's Arenas's real legacy.

I am a DIE-HARD Bulls fan. But the inconsistency of the team right now is, to say the least, disheartening. Our best players are exhausted and/or injured. Derrick Rose is still skeptical on his Return, and frankly I don't think we can get past the second round of the playoffs. Next year, however, our players will be rested, (hopefully) healthy, and ready to go at it again. We have guys stepping up their games as Rose is gone, and it just makes me so excited to see them all on the court together.

It was a truly admirable run, but this is NOT a title team even with Derrick. They're tired, injured, and Miami still exists. Thibs did a stunning job keeping this team competitive but the lack of talent is just so apparent. I don't think this is something to be sad about, I bet if you asked any of the Bulls front office folks, behind closed doors, before the season if they honestly thought this team was a contender, they'd tell you probably not. I think it's time to start looking ahead and think about retooling to make the run next year or in 14. I'm not trying to be a downer just honest, it was a fun season, and if we hit the playoffs and win one or two series it'll be awesome, I just think the magic, ""maybe we could do it"" feeling is over.

Might be a bit over-dramatic, but I value being battle-tested.

I LOVE the '10-'12 bench mob, but when Rose went down along with Noah, they couldn't beat a lowly Sixers team. Now, I understand that it may be unfair, for the mental impact of losing your MVP in the very 1st game may be too overwhelming.

The reason why I loved the '12-'13 team is that they lost two of their leaders in Hinrich and Deng mid-series, but still found a way to pull it off in a game 7 on the road, after losing two games.

I'm bummed that we will never test the team out and see if they can actually make a push for a title, legitimately. I thought that our team was good, add Rose and a better back up Center than Nazr and we were poised to give the NBA hell.

Rose on the floor with either Marco or Nate. Maybe either of those two can be the 2nd shot creator that we need to ""take the load off"" of Rose.

I absolutely LOVE the way the team competed and metaphorically yelled ""Screw You!"" to the basketball gods that have handicapped them so.

Of course, Thibs still found something to fault -- too many turnovers and the defense in the fourth quarter was not up to his standards.  But they'll keep beating the teams they are supposed to beat, and fighting the teams they aren't supposed to beat.  They're used to being the best regular season team in the league, and I don't think they'll go down without a fight.  The only thing that worries me is health, particularly the health of Noah and Deng.  They are both playing heavy minutes and the Bulls can't afford to lose either.
