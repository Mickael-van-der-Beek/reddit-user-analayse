1. The first change is a minor one, when submitting a opinion piece or a editorial please use a [opinion] tag, politics can be a heated subject and it is only fair for people to know if they are going to read a news article or someones opinion. 

2. Since /r/internationalpolitics is founded on the principal that politics worldwide deserve to be placed in the spotlight.  We want to make sure that no subject or event overshadows other subjects. The rule we already have in place is to not allow U.S. related news simply because of reddit's main demographic group. So far this has been working great and we have seen a fair amount of new users coming here through the /r/politics sidebar because of this.
However in some cases other political events dominate the news as well, this could result in a frontpage where all subjects are overshadowed by one other subject. So in order to prevent this we put something that is implicitly understood in the sidebar: If this happens rules will be adjusted accordingly.     
To make something clear: We will not add new subjects to the *not allowed* list, the most likely course of action would be a weekly collection thread where related articles can be posted as top comments and discussed in that thread. 

3. We had a few image or youtube post where people did not leave a comment describing the relevance. These where removed. Starting from today direct links to visual media are not allowed anymore. Instead they should be included in a self-post containing the description of their relevance and ideally also other points the submitter would like to discuss.
For self-posts where videos are the main content the ""do no editorialize the title"" rule does apply. 

As you can see they are mostly a refinement of the existing rule set. Leave a reply if something is not clear, we are happy to reply and discuss these rules. 

On a slightly related note, really: **do not editorialize the titles of your link.**
Most removals are because of this rule, let people decide what they think of the content you submit. Even better, leave a comment describing your thoughts or opinion.

Currently we sit at 1,641 subscribers and according to the traffic stats we are visited by 500 to 750 unique visitors per month (with some peaks in the direction of 1k), this is of course great and I am hoping that this growth will continue! 

However the rate of submissions is still rather low, according to [stattit]( http://stattit.com/r/internationalpolitics/) I am the main contributor of submissions (106) followed by few people that have a average of 4 submissions. 

The submissions I make are those I encounter on my daily round of keeping up with the news, so for me it is not a lot of extra effort and I'll certainly keep posting new content.
However I am just one person and every person has their own personal bias, so in that regard I would rather see that this sub has a healthy mix of quality submissions from different people. Obviously that is not happening at this point. 

What I would like to know from as much people as possible: 

* Is there something holding you back from submitting new content? 
* Can something be done to encourage new submissions? 
* What are your general feelings about this subreddit?

I'm a student writing my master thesis about the **SNP and the N-VA**, two nationalist parties. This comparison is a way of answering the question wether nationalism is left or right, since the SNP is a left orientated party and the N-VA is a right orientated nationalist party. 

For this, i'm looking for scientific literature about **what makes a party left or right** and definitions of this left/right divide. 
I have found the author Norberto Bobbio who wrote a book about this, but struggle to find more defining books.
I have also found the [Comparative Manifesto Research Project](https://manifestoproject.wzb.eu/) and plan to use the party platforms from last elections as base source for my thesis. 

As a second question, what are the key works on **nationalism** I can refer to or could use. The literature on nationalism is vast and I seem to lose my heading amidst all these books. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The advertisement in question was one of the new Economic Freedom Fighters political group in South Africa, a party recently founded by the old ANC Youth League leader, Julius Malema.   [The video shown in the advertisement in question was this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD3sEQcesdQ).

For those not interested in watching the video, it was a recent press conference held by the EFF where they call for the ""expropriation of land without compensation"", the nationalisation of land without compensation.  They then refer to themselves as a ""protest movement"" and support the violent land reform program of Zimbabwe before calling for a ""revolution"" in South Africa.

Now I am aware that YouTube is an open platform for expression and I am not against the existence of the video, nor am I calling for it to be taken down.  The issue is that this video is being run as an advertisement in South Africa.  Youtube is essentially forcing South African viewers to watch a short clip where a political figure is calling for a revolution in South Africa.  I do not believe this is acceptable.

TL;DR - YouTube is running an advertisement that calls for a revolution in South Africa.",,False,,t5_2tb55,False,,,True,t3_1i5ivb,http://www.reddit.com/r/internationalpolitics/comments/1i5ivb/the_political_use_of_youtube_advertisements/,

Maybe some people talk about these things in more gradated terms but the media certainly doesn't.

Is this really reasonable? Is all torture equal and should it be presented as such to the world? Maybe it is all wrong, maybe it is all never justifiable, but even though murder is never justifiable we still have 1st degree, 2nd degree and so on, because the distinction still makes a difference in how we treat the perps even though they _all_ did wrong.

Additionally, because torture is this blanket category that covers everything from force feeding to isolation to loud music to beatings to stress positions and on and on there is a strong incentive for governments to insist that their particular technique is not ""really"" torture. If there were a graduated scale based on the level of suffering caused (which might surprise us, long term isolation is probably significantly worse in many ways to the inducement of short term physical pain) then it might be easier for anti-torture campaigners to say ""well no it's not level 1 torture but it easily compares with the other methods in level 5 torture"".
