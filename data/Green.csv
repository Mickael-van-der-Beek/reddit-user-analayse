But FDA's own research shows the fish have high levels of a cancer-causing growth hormone and are 40% more likely to cause an allergic reaction in humans. ,leftofmarx,117,13,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/16ty6r/genetically_engineered_salmon_aquadvantage_could/,"Relevant article: http://www.examiner.com/article/genetically-engineered-salmon-linked-to-higher-risk-of-cancer-allergies

If the AquAdvantage® salmon is approved this year, it will be the first GE animal ever approved for human consumption. This could open the floodgates for more GE animals. Pigs with human growth genes, cows that produce milk with human proteins, etc. It almost goes without saying that the regulatory process will grow more and more lax after the gates are open wide for industry to exploit.

Despite industry claims that the fish is safe for human consumption and the environment (which is dubious at best - the FDA Environmental Assessment was based on the fish not being grown in the US anyway), the research that this is being based on is completely inadequate. Only 6 fish were used in the allergy tests, for example.

While I personally think genetic engineering has a place in agricultural and environmental research, we are allowing industry to rubber-stamp their own creations without enough independent research.

Mr. President,

If Democrats continue to meet conservatives ""half way"" and the conservatives keep moving farther and farther right, the left gets left behind.

I'm tired of voting for a Democratic ticket that consistently ignores the majority in this country. Next election, I plan on voting for the Green Party even if it risks a Republican win.

[1] http://www.gangarights.org/ganga-right-act/why-the-ganga-needs-rights/

From the site: ""The river is managed as property, without any rights of its own – its treatment is governed by the whims of those entities (private or government) deemed to 'own' the Ganga. Clearly, such a system of 'ownership' fails to protect the interests of either the Ganga or of the millions of people who depend upon it for survival.Now it is time for the Ganga to win its rights.
Moving from mere regulation to a rights-based system of environmental protection will provide a means to defend the rights of the Ganga, as well as the rights of the millions of people who depend upon it.""

It doesn't really have an effect on me personally but it frustrates me. I recently moved to a new area and I see it even more here and it's just about more than I can take. So I put a pad of sticky notes in my car. When I park near a car that has noticeably under-inflated tires I write them a friendly reminder to check their tire pressures and slip it under their wiper blade. I just printed out a sheet of little slips that say the same thing so that I don't have to take time to write a note every time. I'm hoping that within the next few weeks I will see a few less saggy tires at work/school and church.

So have any of you guys done something similar to try and remind people to do something that is just plain common sense?",,False,,t5_2qh6q,False,,,True,t3_113abh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Green/comments/113abh/does_anyone_else_have_a_pet_peeve_that_theyve/,
