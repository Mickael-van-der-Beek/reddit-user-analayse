1357679738.0,79,self.Animals,167ecl,Man abuses animals on NYC streets for money. Please share to stop this horrible person from exploiting these poor animals!,Lolorey,101,22,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animals/comments/167ecl/man_abuses_animals_on_nyc_streets_for_money/,"A few minutes ago, I came across this man on 44th and 6th avenue with 4 dogs, 4 cats and 6 guinea pigs all seemingly calm and obedient. I had seen him around midtown a few other times this year with a completely different batch of animals.  Like most New Yorkers, I was in a rush and never took the time to stop and see what he was actually doing… 

Today I did.  There was the little orange cat tied to a string that reminded me of my cat. I went to the front of the crowd of tourists to watch this individual take out a bunch of sedatives and proceeded to shove one down a cats mouth, push a dog with a stick and drug and then toss a guinea pig on top of the others. I restrained myself from hitting him as he gave the other kittens some more pills and tightened the little string that kept all the kittens together when the little orange one tried to hop around… 

I caused a scene. A big one.  

I proceeded to yell at the man and ask him “How are those sedatives working out for you?” The man yelled at me when I pulled out my phone to call the cops. He told me I couldn’t stop him and he would just move his location. So I spent the next few minutes informing every person watching this man that he was a piece of shit and sedates and abuses the animals. I told them not to give him any money, which pissed him off even more. He continued to yell at me and get in my face. 

Needless to say, I called 911 and told them about the situation. To be honest, I am not even sure what it is going to accomplish. The best/worst case scenario would be that these animals are taken away from this asshole. But then what happens? They go to a kill shelter, where they will most likely be put to sleep anyway? He won’t be arrested. He will go back to a shelter and just get a different batch of animals to exploit.

If it wasn’t for the fact that I am positive he changes his batch of animals every few months, I may have left it alone. It just completely disgusted me to think that this guy makes a living drugging and abusing animals blatantly on the streets of Midtown Manhattan and no one does anything about it. 

I hope I did the right thing. I think I did. But I ask all of you to take a minute and watch this video. Share it if you want. But if you see him around, PLEASE don’t give this piece of shit money. And if you really want to be proactive, report him to the ASPCA or call the cops. The more violations this man gets, the better chance we have of stopping him.

Love and attention? Vet?
What the little bastard needs is to get his ass kicked some more.
He's been a little bitch since he was a kitten- crying when he wants out of his cage, crying when he's hungry. The only thing that could shut him up was me throwing one of my boots at him.
He's almost 3 now. He needs to be a man and learn to do a few things on his own.
I give his fat ass food, and all I ask from him is a little respect for me, and my home. Does he give it to me? No. He constantly does things to piss me off.
I tell him not to go on the counter in the kitchen. Does he listen? Nope. I catch him almost every day when I come home up on the counter. So, I have to rough him up a bit- smack him around and show him who's boss.
Oh, and he is ABSOLUTELY NOT ALLOWED anywhere near my room or my bed.
[1] This , is what happened to the little shithead the last time he broke that rule.
I call it the ""punishment box"".
For passing the threshold of my bedroom door, it's 1 hour bound up in the box. For sleeping on my bed, it's 3 hours. I have a zero-tolerance policy for cat hair in my bed.

The turtle was headed for the grassy median in the middle of the highway where it would have inevitably become trapped. Then I saw the cause for the cars in front of me breaking: a man had quickly pulled his car to the side of the road and was running back to pick the turtle up and move it to safety. Traffic wasn't so heavy that he had to risk his own safety, but he definitely had to hustle to get out into the middle lane and back without traffic having to swerve around him.

He was very thin, and his fur was matted everywhere, he had sores around his neck and feet and his nose was all bloodied and sore.. to make it worse it was pouring down with rain. 

I didnt know what I should do to be doing right, so I snapped a few pics and (I had no credit to call) drove straight to the nearest vets. I showed them the pics and they said if I could catch it to bring it in they would take care of it (I dont know why they could not go and lift it) or else I should just ring the local dog warden.

I drove back to try and get the dog but he was gone-I drove back and forth a few times but no luck. Eventually I got home and told my parents-they said they would drive up this time and we could see what we could do. So we drove up and the dog wasnt in the lane again. 

However there was no one around so I opened the farm gates and walked about a bit and eventually the dog came out-I lifted it and it allowed me to without so much as a whimper. I have to also say the farm was a total hellhole and there were a few sheep running around in the same state as the dog.

So my Dad and I got the dog into the back of the car and drove straight to the vets. They could not believe how bad it looked either. They put a lead on it to take it through to the kennels and it just looked up at me and would not budge. Everyone was saying I had just made a friend! 

So the vets assured me they would wash and shave it tonight-the fur is so matted it will require a lot of shaving, and they would make sure it ate and got some warmth.

I cannot tell you how glad I feel to have been able to do something for that poor dog. Tonight I know it is warm, safe and cared for, and I am going to check up on it on Monday morning.

I am also reporting that farm to the relevant authorities on Monday morning, goodness knows how many more animals need help.

I would love to take the dog myself, and I am thinking about it; the only thing stopping me is my financial situation.",,False,,t5_2qi0c,False,,,True,t3_1gf5y8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animals/comments/1gf5y8/i_rescued_an_abused_neglected_animal_today/,

(Gallery included)",Krzys_CCE,29,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animals/comments/1ho51z/need_help_found_a_pigeon_next_to_my_house_it/,"So I found a pigeon wondering at the front yard of my house, he kept digging trough our flowers for worms/food.  Our street is fairly busy and there is lots of animals around and after few hours of that, i got him into our backyard, its very secluded there, he has lots of flowers to dig around, he doesn't seem to be scared of people at all.  He was actually following me, once it started to get dark he tried to get into the house.  I honestly dont know if I should just let him be or put him in some sort of a box and take him in.  He seems like he cant fly, looks healthy but has no markings or tags whatsoever.  My plan is to leave him at the backyard for the night where he will be safe away from any animals around this area.  Tomorrow maybe make a flyer and post it around to see if its a lost pet.

Here is few pictures from today [Link to imgur gallery](http://imgur.com/a/Ij7wf)

Reddit please help!  I am not sure if I am doing the right thing here.

Edit: 

Thanks for all the help everyone.  The pigeon is now in my garage, sitting inside a wooden basket with some seeds and a water dish.  I just checked up on him and he is now relaxed, sitting down and sleeping.  I feel much better knowing he will be safer overnight.

**Update**

**So looks like for now we will keep him until we find the owner.  He seems to be very friendly, he is following me around today, he is very curious and also lets me pick him up and seems like he is used to it.

Got him some birdfeed as suggested by pet store employee, the pigeon go to it right away and started eating and then drinking water right after.**

Please read,grumpyhamster,26,3,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animals/comments/1k7wx4/trying_to_stop_healthy_pets_being_put_down_please/,"Hi People, I know this is probably the wrong subreddit but really need to get the word out about a new subreddit.

Its /r/RescuePetsUK

I have created this due to personal reasons and difficulty in rehoming 2 cats. I have seen a few subreddits, but most seem USA based. This one is for the UK only.

I have a personal hatred of healthy animals being put down due to no other reason than they cant find a home for them.

So I have decided to create this subreddit to try and find pets a new home. Every animal deserves love and care, and if I can save just one animal from being put down. Well, I consider that a great success.

So, if you know anyone that is trying to get a pet rehomed, for whatever reason. Please make a post in /r/RescuePetsUK

All posts are moderated, but will be reviewed and accepted as soon as possible.

If you work at an animal shelter, please drop me a pm so I can set you as a verified poster. I will not be doing any background checking, thats the poster's responsibility.

Many Thanks

Moderators, I know this is probably not the right subreddit. But due to the nature of this post, I would be grateful if you could leave it up.",,False,,t5_2qi0c,False,,,True,t3_1k7wx4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Animals/comments/1k7wx4/trying_to_stop_healthy_pets_being_put_down_please/,
