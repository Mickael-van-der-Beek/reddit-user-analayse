1360192621.0,1019,self.Guitar,1812dt,"After playing guitar for more than 20 years, here are some things I've learned.",jecahn,1204,185,412,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1812dt/after_playing_guitar_for_more_than_20_years_here/,"I've seen a lot of ""guitar myth"" threads and ""what do you wish you knew then"" threads. Just figured that I'd add mine in as well. These are things that I've learned playing guitar. All of them have made me better or made my guitar sound better. Feel free to add.

1. Are you ""practicing"" or ""just playing?"" There's a difference. Practice something new until you get it down. Otherwise you just go back to the playing the same things, thus deepening your rut.

2. Don't rehearse, gig. The live music scene is not what it once was, I know. There was a time that it was hard to pick a show to go to. Now, it's hard to find a show at all. That said, there are few ways to get better faster than to play in front of people. Do it. The more intimidating the crowd, the more valuable to your playing it will be.

3. Along the same lines, ALWAYS play with people better than you. This was taught to me by one of the best guitar players I ever knew (and played with.) He was the local legend guy who was in the band that opened for the Allman Bros back in the day when they would come around. You know the one. By the time I met him, he was painting houses and playing pick-up gigs on weekends. He was 30 years older than me at the time (he's gone, now.) This guy could tear it up, legitimately. He was just effortless. He was the one who told me to always play with guys way better than you because it will make you push yourself and as long as they see that you're trying to keep up, they'll never make you feel foolish. They'll respect you and grab your wrist when you need a hand out of the hole you dug. He was right.

4. You don't need that amp, guitar, pedal, digital thing. I've owned everything. I own a ridiculous amount of equipment, currently. In the band I gig most often with, you know what I play? A Squier Classic Vibe Tele and a 15 watt Excelsior amp. The Marshall and the other Marshall and the SuperSonic and the Deluxe Reverb stay in the basement. I'm too old to be humping 4X12's and heads and 60 pound combos up and down stairs in NYC. I don't need to be anywhere near as loud as I think I do and any place that is too big for my 15 watt to carry is going to have a soundguy who will want to mic my amp and in that case it doesn't matter how many or few watts I have. The '62 CS Strat and the Custom Heritage Les Paul and the Ibanez Prestige were damn expensive and I want to have a few cocktails and bullshit with my band after I'm done playing, not worry about keeping an eye on my gear. The point is this: gear has come A LONG way. Even in the past 5 years. When I started playing the stuff that people said was crap was legitimately, unplayable crap and actually, even the ""good stuff"" wasn't all that great. (late 70's Strats and Les Pauls? Firewood!) That's not the case these days. Even the cheap stuff is solid. New gear is not going to be the secret key that unlocks the tone in your head. Trust me on this. If you suck on cheap gear, you're going to suck on expensive gear, you'll just be broke and suck. Get good at using the stuff you've got. You know how you've read that your tone is in your fingers? It's true. Practice with what you've got. You don't need new gear. Save your money or spend it on lessons.

5. Now that you're being superselective about what you buy, don't get rid of anything. EVER. There are very few pieces of gear that I let go over the years that I don't wish I had back. Roland Jazz Chorus amps, old Strats, original Hamer archtops, Strats that weren't that old when I got and parted with them but are now considered ""vintage"" and thus would cost much more than I'd be willing to spend on them to get them back. The list goes on. Don't get rid of stuff. At the least, you'll eventually be sorry. At the most, it will suddenly turn into ""vintage gear"" and become desirable so that even if you want it for playing purposes, the collectors market will dictate the price. That Line 6 amp? The one that I told you was garbage in another thread? There's nothing wrong with it. It's a good amp. Keep it, use it. If you get rid of it, you're not going to get anywhere near as much as you paid for it and you'll always regret it. I had a '69 Gibson L6S that I should have held on to. If only because if I wanted to sell it, now, I could get 3-4 times what I sold it for 10 years ago.

6. Stop reading shit on the internet. The boards on the internet are hilarious to me. Everyone is either constantly complaining or giving out unsolicited advice as some sort of expert. The Tweed Deluxe is NOT the best amp you'll ever play out of. 7.25 radius necks DON'T fret out if they're set up competently. That guy who claims to own three original '59 bursts, doesn't. Nitro isn't better than Poly. Poly isn't better than Nitro. There's no reason that your guitar needs to look like it was owned by a drug addict who threw it down the stairs as a morning ritual. The Fender Custom shop guitars don't suck. Gibson's standard production, non Custom Shop stuff DOES suck. The Squier Classic Vibe series is damn good but the guy who claims that he likes it better than his buddy's original '52 Blackguard is lying, either to himself or to you and probably both. You know all the crap you read. Take it with a grain of salt. If these guys spend as much time playing as monkeying around on the internet, talking about gear, they'd know that a lot of what they all agree and disagree on is nonsense. All you need to be an internet guitar expert these days is a WiFi connection and a credit card. Don't believe me? Go on YouTube and type in ""gear-that-I'm-about-to-buy review."" On ALL of fucking youtube, there are about 4 guys demoing gear who can actually play. They even say in the description, ""Ignore the playing, I know I suck, this is more about demoing the tone of the amp."" I don't give a shit how good or bad that equipment is that you're playing out of. If you suck, you'll suck equally on good or bad equipment.

7. Get a good tech guy. A guy who really knows his stuff. Like, an actual luthier if you can find one. I posted in another thread about this. Find a guy who watches you play, asks you what you like and THEN sets up your guitar. If the guy takes your guitar, doesn't talk to you and immediately starts telling you how low he can get your action, run screaming and find a new guy. Have your guitars setup and gone over at least once a year. Seasons change and these things are made mostly of wood. They're gonna move around. Having your guitar feel great is going to make you confident and when you're confident and the guitar feels great, you're going to play great and sound great.

8. Another thing that I'll add, in keeping with the gear stuff is not to let anyone tell you that your gear is crap. It's a mind game and it will interfere with your playing. If you sound like crap, it's because your playing is crap. Not your gear. You sounding like crap is actually good news because it's a fixable problem and it's cheap or free to fix. There's nothing wrong with Squiers, LTD's or Indonesian Jacksons. If you like that, make it yours. I don't know if you've looked at the Ibanez website lately but there are an awful lot of dayglo guitars that people swore up and down were ugly just 10 years ago. That said, if you want a CS Strat, get one. There is a difference and it's worth paying for. Just don't let anyone tell you that your gear is either too much or too little for you.

I'm sure there are more that I can add but this is all that comes to mind and I""m sure that this is too long as it is.

**1: Diatonicism** 

There are only 12 unique pitches. After that there are only octaves. The pitches are A, A#, B, C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, and G#. I won't use flats because B flat is the same as A#, etc , and having more than one name for the same pitch is confusing. All adjacent pitches are equally spaced apart, or in other words, the octave is evenly divided by 12.   

The diatonic scale is the basis of all western music. Diatonicism is simply a specific spread of 7 notes. The spread of the 7 notes corresponds to the natural lettered notes (no sharps), or a visual way of looking at it: the white keys on the piano. A mode is choosing one of the 7 notes from the diatonic scale as your tonic, or home note. That means, because there are 7 notes in the diatonic scale, there are 7 modes. 

Look at a piano. If you only play the white notes, you have 7 notes, which are A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Depending on which note you choose as your tonic (home note), you are in one of the 7 modes available in the diatonic key. For example, if you choose A as your tonic you're in the Aeolian or minor mode, and if you choose C as the tonic your in Ionian or the major mode. Of course there are 7 notes, and you could choose any of the 7 notes as your tonic not just A or C. 

The seven modes of the diatonic scale comprised of the white keys of the piano:

A as tonic: A Aeolian (also called A minor)

B as tonic: B Locrian

C as tonic: C Ionian (also call C major)

D as tonic: D Dorian

E as tonic: E Phrygian

F as tonic: F Lydian

G as tonic: G Mixolydian

Note that Aeolian and Ionian are also called the minor and major mode respectively. These modes get an extra name because about 99% of western music is in one of these two modes. They are heavily favoured. 

This is only 1 of the 12 diatonic keys though. To go through each key, we will transpose the pattern up a semitone 11 times. If we transposed it up a 12th time, we'd be back where we started at a higher octave (12 semitones is an octave). Piano is not a great transposing instrument, but guitar is, so it's tab time!

    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|----------------------------5--7-------

    A|----------------5--7--8----------------

    E|-----5--7--8---------------------------

You can see above I just played the notes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and finally A an octave higher. This is the same as the white notes on piano. If we choose the first note as the tonic we are in the minor mode, and since the first note is A we're in A minor. Choosing the second note as our tonic would put us in B Locrian mode, third note: C major, fourth note: D Dorian, fifth note: E phrygian, Sixth note: F Lydian, seventh note: G Mixolydian. Same as before!

You should realize that no matter which mode you are playing in above you are playing the exact same 7 notes. The only difference is which note you choose as your home base (tonic).  This is why A minor is called the relative minor of C major and C major the relative major of A minor. Because the two modes are the same notes. 

Above we tabbed the diatonic key of A minor / C major.  (the diatonic key is defined either by it's minor or major mode. Hence you see the key of A minor, or key of C major, but you would never see the key of D Dorian, even though all three modes I just listed are the same notes. Essentially, music in modes other than the major or minor, historically was never really written, so now the keys are limited to a major or minor definition. I suppose there's nothing stopping you from scoring a piece in any mode, F# Locrian for example)

    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|----------------------------6--8-------

    A|----------------6--8--9----------------

    E|-----6--8--9---------------------------


Above is A# minor/ C# major. All we did was transpose every note up one semitone. The pattern, or spread of the notes is the same. The modes that correspond with this diatonic key (A#minor or C# major) are:

A# Aeolian or A# minor 

C Locrian (because B# is C)

C# Ionian or C# major

D# Dorian

F Phrygian (because E# is F)

F# Lydian

G# Mixolydian

Now we've tabbed 2 of the 12 diatonic keys.

Continuing to transpose up a semitone we get the diatonic key of B minor/D major:


    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|----------------------------7--9-------

    A|----------------7--9--10---------------

    E|-----7--9--10--------------------------

The modes of the above key are:

B Aeolian or B minor 

C# Locrian 

D Ionian or D major

E Dorian

F# Phrygian 

G Lydian

A Mixolydian

That's 3 of the 12 diatonic keys. We can continue this pattern to get all 12 diatonic keys, each with 7 unique modes. 

So that's about all there is to it. but let's continue with a practical example to make sure you understand.


Say someone says ""I'm playing in F# Dorian bro!"". 

Okay. Here's D Dorian as we saw before, with the tonic in brackets:

    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|-------------------------5--7----------

    A|--------------[5]--7--8----------------

    E|-----5--7--8---------------------------

So we need that D (bracketed note) to be an F#. F# is 4 semitones higher than D, so we raise every note 4 semitones:

    e|---------------------------------------

    B|---------------------------------------

    G|---------------------------------------

    D|-----------------------------9--11-----

    A|----------------[9]--11--12------------

    E|-----9--11--12-------------------------
 
Now the bold note, which is the Dorian mode tonic is an F#, so we're in F# Dorian. We can also see that F# Dorian is the same notes as:

C# minor (the first note, the 9 on the E string is a C#)

D# Locrian, (the 11 on the E string is a D#)

E Major  (12 on the E sting is an E)

G# Phrygian (11 on the A string is a G#)

A Lydian ( 12 on the A string is an A) 

B mixolydian (9 on the D string is a B)

I was thinking about writing up a brief course for learning the basics of DIY guitar pedals. I got into the habit a year or so ago and thought my trials and tribulations would help those who are interested. If there is enough interest, I'l probably get started on it. I thought about also getting together kits of tools/parts to get started and helping folks save by buying in bulk. Is this something you guys are interested in? I imagine the kits would be less than $100 and get you everything you need to get started plust parts to build a simple pedal. Anyway, let me know! 


Wow, I'm really excited about the response. I'm going to try and get some more firm pricing down for you folks here shortly.

Not a guitarist myself, but i come from a long line of pickers. One of those being my uncle, Alan. My family is from Moore, Oklahoma and as you know, we've been through some shit the last few weeks. thankfully none of my family was hurt, and we had very little property damage, but in the aftermath of the storms, we weren't so lucky. see theres a reall shitty subset of people in the world, and when they see/hear about a tragedy they get dollar signs in their eyes and decide to to fuck over their fellow man. This manifested itself in the theft of ALL my uncle's band equipment. 

He plays in a band called ""Brown Note"", and has been building his sound setup for 25 years. it was his pride and joy. But last week, after loading up their trailer on wednesday, for a friday show, my uncle returned to his house to find it gone. all of it. 70k worth of speakers, boards, guitars, and all sorts of home made shit he'd made over the years. Luckily it was insured, but insurance can only do so much. 

The biggest casualty was my uncle's favorite guitar. His Charvel. here's a pic of [""The Goat""](http://i.imgur.com/wfYUpha.jpg).

Its a Charvel San Dimas Style 2. and is out of production. My late Grandpa helped him pick it out, and it means the world to him. 

So my request is this, oh axe-wielders of reddit. If by ANY small chance anyone EVER sees this guitar, or any of the other equipment in my post to /r/oklahoma please let me know. the rest of the equipment is whatever. it was insured, but that guitar was an extension of him. It would mean the world to my family to have it back. Thanks for your time everyone.

So here is my proposition to get some people contributing:

---

Let's have a weekly theme! I say we dedicate one or two days a week to a certain topic. I'd like the one or two days to fall on the weekend. That way you won't be interrupted by work or school while you're exploring all the cool new content. On those days, post anything related to the topic. 

Example; If the topic is ""Beginner Week,"" you might see posts discussing proper left hand position, picking styles, differences in guitar materials, links to a new player's first cover, song suggestions, etc. 

See where I'm going with this? I'd like to have the themes planned out well in advance so that you can prepare your material during the week. This is just an idea. It might also make sense to have the theme ongoing throughout the week. 

Posts could also have new tags such as [TIP], [TABS], [LESSON], and so forth. Ultimately, if we follow through with this, I'd like it to have its own place in the sidebar. 

Here are some themes we could have:

* Beginner Week
* Advanced Week
* Acoustic Week
* Electric Week
* Rock Week (Can have a week for each style-- Jazz, country, whatever)
* Effect Week
* Accessory Week
* Theory Week
* Band Week (Share clips of your band, or your favorite artists)

So tell me; What do you think? Please leave any and all suggestions/comments you might have.

Steve Vai has been one of my greatest musical influences and needless to say, I was ecstatic about the opportunity.  The experience was really fascinating and inspiring, so I thought I’d share it with you and try my best to relay what Steve was telling us.  

I flew from Boston to LAX where a transportation service picked up all the contest winners, and took us to our hotel.  Upon entering the hotel lobby, the first thing I saw was a large tank behind the front desk with a mannequin in it.  Upon further inspection I realized the mannequin was actually a real human and a living human nonetheless.  To my right, there was a display of a woman in a dress and high heels tearing down drywall.  It was a Tuesday night yet the hotel was bustling with people dressed in the finest/sluttiest attire, and I felt like I was in an episode of Entourage.  My hotel room featured a bright orange bathroom and a thermostat that simply read “blow; hard, harder, stop.”  I headed back downstairs and sat down in the hotel’s swanky restaurant to have dinner with the other contest winners.  There was a door in the back of the restaurant that led to a mysterious room lit only by strobe lights.  As we ate our dinners, people would stumble in and out of the strobe room adjusting bra straps and skirts.   It was surreal to be in such a crazy place under equally crazy circumstances.  I felt at home however, when I got to know the other guitarists.   These guys were so nice and supportive and it reminded me of hanging out at Berklee.  

The next morning, we didn’t have anything scheduled until the clinic at night, and I didn’t want to sit around in the hotel room feeling nervous about meeting Steve, so I  took the opportunity to meet up with one of my mentors and dear friends Josh Brill.  Josh taught me at the Berklee summer programs when I was in high school and has really helped me develop as a musician and as a person.  Josh has an incredible gift for getting people to see things from a positive perspective, and talking to him all morning really helped settle my nerves.  Naturally, I really hoped Steve Vai would like me and I had prepared a press kit to share my music with him.  I was fairly anxious about meeting him because I didn’t want to miss my chance to become friends with my idol.  Josh helped me see that whether Vai and I became pals or not, I had already won by being invited there in the first place and that I should savor the moment for what happens rather than what could happen.  He helped me realize that if I enter the clinic from a positive position of gratitude rather than expectation, I would enjoy the clinic more and have a more meaningful experience.  I decided that I would focus on what Steve already gave me by flying me up to meet him, rather than on what could happen.  I still planned on giving Steve my music, but I refused to invest myself in how he would receive it.  Although my mind still wandered away from that idea every now and then, I was definitely on a good course.

That night at the clinic the other guitarists and I sat in the show room of a huge Guitar Center and eagerly awaited Steve’s arrival.  Each contest winner received a free guitar and wah-pedal, and after taking a moment to tune up we all began WANKING FURIOUSLY on our new instruments! After all, we were in a guitar store.  When Steve Vai entered the room I got that “oh shit, there he is!” kind of feeling.  He walked on the stage, looked around at everyone, turned to me and said, “Hey, I’ve met you before!”  In a roar of excitement I replied “Yeah four times!” (Which is true.)  He said, “Man you could be my brother-in-law or something,” and like an idiot I replied, “Well, actually I am your brother’s brother-in-law.”  Then it got quiet for a second.  

Steve immediately opened the floor for questions and not too many people were raising their hands.  Since I had A LOT of questions, I ended up asking a ton of them and I got some incredibly inspiring information out of him!  He also asked us what our goals were and offered personal advice.  

Here are my two most important questions and Steve’s answers as I understood them:

Q:  I write more material than I can afford to record.  My goal is to be able to record my music whenever I want, in the most pristine quality, and have my albums fund the production, promotion, and tours of my next albums.  Do you have any advice for me?  

A:  Steve said that there is absolutely no reason why I can’t do that, and that the first important thing to do is to visualize myself achieving my goal.  When I get a clear mental image of how success would look, feel, and sound, I can properly take the steps to reach my idea of success.  

Secondly, to achieve my goals, I have to look at the journey to my idea of success as a path with little steps.  Navigating through each step or idea I have requires a lot of creative thought of course, but ultimately, successfully climbing one of the steps requires me to find joy in the process of climbing in the first place.  In other words, the way to move closer to achieving my goals, is to focus on the things that I love about the process. Steve said that you can only truly succeed at something that you love doing.  To me that means if you have to get a day job, you should view your job as something that further enables your passion.  Your job is something that enables you to move forward on your journey.  Having this positive perspective allows you to maintain focus on everything you love about the process, so that you will be better at it.  Clearly people do a better job when they love what they’re doing.  Also, each time you take one of those little steps forward, you feel really great and accomplished, which encourages you to do even more!  

Finally, you must never question whether or not your goal can be achieved because that sucks the pleasure out of everything and leads to failure.  Vai said, “If you think you’ll fail, you’ll fail.  If you think you’ll succeed, you’ll succeed.  No matter what, you’re right.”

Basically, success comes from love of the process, having a strong idea of what the process is, and NEVER allowing yourself to doubt whether or not the goal can be achieved.  The love has a spiraling effect to it, where the more you love about what you do, the more you love what you do.

Q:  I am about to graduate from Berklee, and I am making the sudden jump from the academic bubble to the professional universe.  You made that switch very abruptly jumping from Berklee to Zappa’s band.  Can you tell me about that transition and what it was like?

A:  There is nothing you can do to prepare for it.  It is chaos.  However, if you focus on your goals (through the process described earlier,) you will find your way in the business.  You need to truly believe in yourself.  If you doubt yourself, you become that doubt.  The game is 99% mental.

I had a very positive attitude going into the clinic thanks to my morning with Josh, the other guitarists were extremely cool, and Steve Vai was so inspirational.  I feel like I was really able to soak it in.  So, when it came time to give Steve my press kit.  I simply told him what it was, and that if he wants to check out the music it’s there for him.  I let him have my work that I poured my heart into, but didn’t pressure him to keep it.  I didn’t have to, because I know that no matter what happens, I will succeed.

I'm so excited I haven't slept in 36 hours!,Lothar34,757,115,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1hwubq/finally_broke_a_plateau_after_nearly_20_yrs_im_so/,"After picking up the guitar and quickly putting it back down many times over the years, due to frustration and thoughts that I'm 'just not musically inclined' enough to torture myself, one day I looked at my Battlefield 3 stats...over 2 WEEKS of game time.  Not a proud moment, so I told the wife, 'what if I'd been practicing guitar all those hours?  How much more would I have to show for my efforts?""  Maybe I'd at least learn a song or two.  So I dropped the controller &amp; dusted off the Strat.  I also read a book that talks about the power of practice and how it builds myelin, or simply put, lays neural fiber cable where dial-up once existed.  There are other books with similar points (10000 hours required to become expert at anything, etc) I won't elaborate on this post about practice specifics, but long story short, I've come farther in one year than in the previous 17 combined.  I'm still terrible but I can see progress week to week, and even day to day sometimes and than gets me excited and motivated to practice more.  Cut to yesterday, and I'm working on the 2nd Slash, Heaven's Door solo.  I'm not a huge GNR fan, and never really loved that song, but I'd identified that bending to pitch and timing were areas I needed to improve and its a GREAT solo for both problems and it's more fun to jam with a backing track than to run boring scales or exercises or listening to a mind numbing metronome.  So after about a zillion takes, and occasionally getting though it with no major mistakes,  I finally nailed it and for the first time in my life, it felt like the music was flowing out of my fingers like some sort of wizards magic.  No thinking, no worrying about messing up or what phrase was next in the pipeline, just being in the moment and in awe.  My fingers just went there!

1334868223.0,630,self.Guitar,siesy,"A guide to the differences between Distortion, Overdrive, and Fuzz pedals",MistaPitts,735,105,107,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/siesy/a_guide_to_the_differences_between_distortion/,"Hi r/guitar! I was inspired by [this post about fuzz pedals](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/si5jr/what_makes_a_fuzz_pedal_fuzzy/) to do a writeup about the differences between distortion, overdrive, and fuzz pedals. So here goes:

**Distortion** pedals are probably the most common kind of stompbox out there, used by everyone from Steve Vai to Kurt Cobain. They're designed to emulate the sound of heavily overdriven tube amps. Distortion pedals tend to have a thicker, grittier tone, and tend not to add *too* much volume to your signal. Used in conjunction with a tube amp set to break up a bit or an overdrive pedal they can help produce that Van Halen ""brown sound"".

**Tech Talk:** Distortion pedals produce ""hard clipping"" by shorting the peaks of your signal's waveform to ground using diodes placed *after* the op-amp in the pedal. Hard clipping produces odd-order harmonics (think ""gritty""), and also tends to compress the volume a little (""thick and heavy"", but not too loud).

**Examples:** Boss DS-1, ProCo Rat.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**Overdrive** pedals are a little more subtle. They produce a smoother, warmer tone that some say sounds a closer to a lightly overdriven tube amp. These pedals are usually capable of a lot more volume, so many guitarists (notably SRV) use them to boost the signal going into a tube amp and drive the tubes even harder.

**Tech Talk:** Overdrive pedals produce ""soft clipping"" by placing diodes in the feedback loop of the pedal's op-amp. Soft clipping produces more even-order harmonics (think ""smooth""). This type of clipping tends not to compress the volume too much, and many overdrive pedals utilize dual op-amps, so they tend to be pretty loud and are therefore often used as more of a boost than an effect.

**Examples:** Ibanez Tube Screamer, Boss SD-1, OD-1, and Blues Driver

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
**Fuzz** pedals are a little different. They produce a metallic, thick......fuck it, FUZZY tone. Think Hendrix solos, the Black Keys, and Neutral Milk Hotel's bassist. The tone of these pedals varies widely between each brand. Which leads me into:

**Tech Talk:** Fuzz pedals produce a square wave, which is essentially very heavy hard clipping. This sounds very compressed (thick) with lots of odd-order harmonics (grit). Different pedals produce this in different ways, leading to a wide variety of fuzz pedals. Some amplify the signal in order to overdrive the op-amp (like the way tubes distort when pushed too hard), others send the signal through several stages of diode clipping until a square wave is produced.

**Examples:** Big Muff Pi, Dallas Arbiter, Fuzz Face

Please let me know if I missed anything or made any mistakes!

EDIT: **Boost** pedals are basically just an op-amp or other kind of amplification circuit that adds volume to your signal without distorting it. The Robert Keeley Katana comes to mind, I think John Mayer uses one. You can also use many equalizer pedals and pre-amp pedals as clean boosts.",,False,,t5_2qi79,True,,,True,t3_siesy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/siesy/a_guide_to_the_differences_between_distortion/,
1367286885.0,632,self.Guitar,1dds0t,"Reddit, you saved me from a fake guitar",Da_Choppah,730,98,222,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1dds0t/reddit_you_saved_me_from_a_fake_guitar/,"Saturday I went and picked up a new guitar (Fender strat) I bought from a local mom and pop shop. This is a store I've been shopping at for 15 years. And it's an authorized Fender dealer. Let's say my guard was down.

So after getting it home, [I posted it here to show off.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1d8h38/gear_im_finally_a_strat_owner/) Boy am I glad I did.

Some of the user's comments alluded to confusion over what model it was. I'm aware of the rash of fake Gibsons out there but I've never come across a fake Fender, though I don't get around that much. I'm not a ""scene"" guy or anything. And like I said, this is an authorized dealer. I thought nothing of the comments.

I thought about taking the advice of some posters and began looking at dark colored pick guards on 3 tone sunburst strats and I kept noticing that no other American strat I looked at had 2 strings trees like mine. At least not that I could find with a Google search. Ok, so now I'm concerned.

I started doing checks that I found on the internet. Wood insert at truss hole? Yes....seems unusually dark, but it's wood. Correct number of frets, perfect finish. Still good. Logo under magnification, no dots. Still good. Serial # check (why didn't I do this first?)........so it seems this guitar was made in 2007. Well that's quite odd. The guitar is mint. I'm not an expert so perhaps it's not completely out of the ordinary for a 6 year old guitar to be sold new.....but damn it seems odd. 

So that ate at me all morning until I couldn't take it anymore. I had enough and grabbed the guitar and drove to the store when I got off work, fully expecting them to calm me down. As it turns out, my fears were warranted! 

Here's how it went down.

When I walked in, the owner was behind the counter. I've known him as the owner (but never really *known* him) as I shop there maybe once every year or two. 

Owner: ""How can I help you?""

Me: ""I bought this guitar here and I'm kind of concerned with it because I can't find any model that matched this 100% exactly by searching the web.""

Owner looks at it. ""You didn't buy that here. It's not a Fender. It's probably the best fake I've ever seen, but it's fake.""

Me: ""You bet your ass I bought it here. Here's the receipt.""


The owner tried to play this ""you must've bought a real one from us and now you're trying to return a fake one for a refund move"" and I was seeing red. I told him something along the lines of ""I'll be calling the credit card company to cancel the charge, Fender to let them know their authorized dealer sells fakes, and every musician I know to tell them about this store. I spent $80 more here than I could have at Guitar Center because I wanted to support local, and this is what I get?""

Long story short, he asked for a few minutes to make phone calls, found that his son (who sold me the guitar) is a dumbass and admittedly took this guitar as a straight up trade for another guitar. He figured out he effed up but the guy (who had also bought some other things at the time) used a stolen credit card. So he had no way to find the guy and was stuck with a fake. Blah blah blah.

The son allegedly put it on the wall ""as a joke"" with Fender tags on it, and along comes a sucker (me) that is willing to buy it, so he did the wrong thing. Of course I know these fuckers are dirty as shit but that's the line they fed me. 

Once it got to that point, you could tell the owner was scared about his rep, losing Fender authorization, legal action, etc. We reached an agreement that he would refund my money (minus the pickups I bought with the guitar) and let me keep the guitar as well as throw in a Digitech RP255. And I signed a form that his lawyer faxed over agreeing that I would not seek legal action. So I may not own the ""Fender"" I've been wanting, but I own a free fakie and got a new effects toy to play with. So I guess it's a happy ending.

I wanted to send a big THANK YOU to all those that commented on my previous thread. Without them, I probably wouldn't have found the truth about this guitar until it was too late.


tl/dr: Bought USA strat from store, though it might be fake (it was), went back and raised hell, got guitar for free along with effects pedal in exchange for not suing.

I took some notes, they were a little vague but feel free to ask me about anything of the points &amp; I might be able to elaborate.

The main things the guy stressed were:

* **Tone** - He spend the first half an hour or so talking only about tone, which he obviously thinks is very important. However he didn't mean tone as in ""what gear to buy next"", he meant it as in how to get different sounds using only your fingers and the knobs on your guitar. He mentioned that his parents didn't have loads of money when he was a kid so he was forced to emulate all the different sounds he could hear on his favourite songs by only using the same guitar &amp; amp.
Some of the points he made &amp; that I wrote down are:

    * try picking at different points along the string; picking at the bridge sounds different than picking over the neck. 
    * Picking exactly 12 frets above the fretted note provides a 'clarinet'-esque sound.
    * Different sides of the pick produce different sounds, the rounder edge sounds more mellow whereas the sharp edge produces more of a typical strat sound.
    * Volume knob is the most important part of the guitar in changing tone, I believe he called it ""the unsung hero of guitar tone"". He then demonstrated all the sounds he could get out of an amp on full gain:
        * Full volume = Beefy gain sound
        * Midway = still distorted but much thinner sound.
        * Low = can turn it so low that the sound is basically clean but allows you to dig in without being too loud or overpowering. Perfect for funk sounds.
    * Also the vibrato you use can drastically affect the sound of a lick, so he experimented with vibrato speed &amp; shallow vs wide vibrato.

* **Playing by ear**  - Obviously he started playing guitar in an era where there was no internet tabs or guitar pro, so he learnt by ear. He's basically at the level now where anything he can hear in his head, he can play on the guitar without having to think about it too much. He said he started working on his ears when he was a kid by working out all of his favourite TV show themes; he demonstrated a few but I didn't recognize any haha. He also played a few mobile ringtones on the guitar perfectly (the Nokia one etc) and said that you should challenge yourself to play anything you can hum in your head on the guitar. Start simple and work your way up from there.

* **Technique** - he actually discussed this less than you would have expected from a GG masterclass, but of course this is what a lot of the questions were about. Some points that I wrote down:

    * He attributes his picking hand technique not to insane metronome workouts like John Petrucci, but to understanding the most economic way for his picking hand to move (I've heard Paul Gilbert say something similiar). Basically his picking hand's forearm &amp; wrist are completely straight, which he said he found was the easiest way to get effortless high speeds. Obviously this is hard to explain, but experiment with your picking hand position if you're having trouble.

    * He said that he used to alternate pick exclusively until he started to study bebop. Bebop uses more arpeggio-based licks than scale-based, so he worked on his economy picking and found he was terrible at it at first. To develop economy picking he suggested doing exercises that focussed on up-picking exclusively. So he demonstrated an exercise where you take triplet-8th notes on one string that you might normally pick as DUD-DUD-etc and practicing with UDU-UDU- etc. This is seriously hard because upstrokes are naturally very weak, but he said this exercise helped out his economy picking a lot.

    * He also said that picking hand technique will always fail if the fretting hand technique is not up to scratch, so work on perfecting legato technique before trying to master alternate picking. He said ""you should be able to play everything with just one hand (fretting hand legato)"" Also he used a scrunchie on the fretboard's low frets when he demonstrated the legato playing.

Some other random points:

* He advised practicing with a loop pedal / backing tracks over practicing to a metronome, on the basis that playing along with actual music helps develops your musicality &amp; phrasing at the same time as your rhythm.

* He mentioned that he sings along with what he plays in his head, like George Benson but internal. He said that to him this always seemed to be the logical way to approach guitar playing. Also a great quote: ""Is George Benson a guitarist who sings, or a singer who plays guitar?""

* Someone asked about how to get away from playing all the same shapes &amp; box patterns &amp; Guthrie suggested trying to solo on only one string. Doing this forces you to develop your musicality as it means that you can't use all the blues licks &amp; shred runs you have, instead forcing you to approach soloing like a vocalist would.

He talked about loads of other stuff such as playing with Dizzee Rascal &amp; how he wrote Fives (he was sat in a park and heard a bird singing in 5/4). Most of all, he seemed to be a really genuine guy and he actually tried to give good answers to the people that had questions. Also he mentioned that's he'll be spending April working on writing new material.

1364211102.0,498,self.Guitar,1ayux0,I bombed on stage last night.,,600,102,242,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1ayux0/i_bombed_on_stage_last_night/,"Venue: Jam Night at a local Blues Bar. I only recently moved to this city and am just learning where the jam nights are and making new friends with musicians along the way.

Stage amp: Black Star HT-5 

Guitar: MIM Strat with ""Eveything Axe"" pups and recently professionally set up with 11-45's. A pretty sweet combination - when played through the right amp.

Predetermined Requested Playlist: (included) ""Bad Moon Rising"" 

Preparation: To match the original recording, and for a little flair, I had earlier learned that John Fogerty tuned his guitar down one full step (E Form is a D chord) which allowed him to comfortably play a ""rockabilly"" hammer on/pull off sound to go along while the first guitar played in standard tune in D. So, after practicing it at home (and nailing it lick for lick), I decided to leave the guitar in that tuning to play Bad Moon Rising as the first song, then tune back up to standard tuning for the remainder of the tunes. edit: I informed the bass player and first guitar of my different tuning on the first song.

The situation: One of the stage amps is an adequate Peavey (not sure of the model) and a ... Blackstar HT-5 (*cringe*).  IMHO, this is not a good amp for the stage. At all. It's probably okay at home. Knowing it is under-powered for a stage show, and that I might pull the short straw and have to play through it,  I brought along my Ibanez TS-808 to help drive it a little (wrong thinking).

On stage: I suit up and strum my E form against the other guitarist's standard tuned D. Sounds fine. Not perfect, but fine enough. ""*A one and a-two and a-three and a-four* and a-oh-my god I realized the house band can't spell ""dynamics"" and and turns everything up to 11. Jesus-riding-a-bike they were loud.

I could faintly hear my guitar (volume knob now maxed out) so I find the right time (well, close enough) and kneel down to crank all the knobs on the 808 to 11. Mud starts oozing out of the Blackstar.  While on bended knee, I capitalized on the position and prayed, ""Oh lord. Help me through this one and I promise I'll never get back on stage again. What was I thinking. I'm not good (loud) like these guys.""

We're two measures away from my my unsolicited ad lib lead before the house guitarist looks at me to ""Take it away, Chunkaway!"" and I immediately shake my head ""NO NO NO!"" so fast I probably gave myself permanent brain damage, but he just looks at me like, ""You gotta!"". 

Fuck. I whale away but can't hear anything over the bass, drums, first guitar, a slide guitarist who decided to invite himself, and myself crying. 

They eventually lower their volumes so they can hear little ol' me beating the fuck outta my strings. So obviously, the entire band is looking at me - which I'm sure caused the entire crowd (and female companion) to anticipate my awesomeness.  I swore there was a spotlight on me and then I realized it - I wasn't in tune any more. I could hear my heart beating and the sound of the margarita mixer at the bar. ""Please god, strike me with lighting. Take me, lord.""

During my crucifixion, the bass guitarists visibly sees what chords I'm playing and begins to start key-hunting - even though I had clearly told the guys about my tuning down beforehand and to not look at my chords if we somehow got lost (three chords - it shouldn't be that difficult). I instinctively turn away from him so he can't see my left hand.

Oh, the agony. Take me now, lord.

Thankfully, the seasoned veteran house first guitarists picks things back up and my nose remains above water - barely.

For the remainder of the song, I turn my volume down to almost nothing, adjust the tuning a bit - can't find it - and then kinda play air guitar the rest of the way out.

Okay, we got that ""bad one"" out of the way, I'm thinking.  I'll just tune up and move on. I used the stage provided tuner pedal and chase my strings for what felt like an hour and a half (re-checking each string). Fuck! Why isn't this thing tuning? Why does god hate me? Please crowd. It'll get better. Don't leave?

I opted for the last resort - tuning out loud to the lead guitarist - something I simply can. not. stand. to hear when I'm listening to live music.

I get the initial E and tune everything accordingly then strum an E chord against his. Not even close. Is it me? Is it him? Is it both of us? Should I fake an injury and limp off the stage?

I decided to thank the guys and get off stage and let the show go on without me.

""More! More! More!"" Satan's crowd yelled. I think they meant, ""Come on, give it another try"", more than ""We all really liked that. Please entertain us with a similar tune"". 

As I was hunting for the what now appeared to be 6"" wide steps off stage, the owner caught me half way down and told me, ""C'mon. You gotta play one more"". 

All the jammers get free beer if they play - at least two songs. I had only one beer before playing. ""I'll pay double for that beer"", I'm thinking, but he's nice enough to let guys like me (well, much better than me) play there and is a good music appreciator and promoter of talent, so I felt obligated.

I won't go into how horrible the next two songs were (I'll just mention that due to my hay-wired nerves, my mouth was as dry as a biscuit and my voice cracked and I actually coughed mid lyric on the song the owner insisted that I do). 

I couldn't wait to get off that stage.

I also won't mention that the owner borrowed my guitar for the next song and eventually quit playing it because he was having to chase the tuning. I gave him fair warning of the problem. He just didn't realize the severity of it.


In hindsight, I was reminded that, no matter how much you practice and prepare, ""there are going to be nights like that"". But I *am* thinking of taking two weeks off then quitting.

**tl;dr I died a thousand deaths last night**


edit: Thanks for the words of encouragement, guys. I'll be back - with my own amp next time and the safety of a standard-tuned guitar. That is, if they don't have a picture of me posted on the door along with the words, ""KEEP OUT"".

(And after you've basked in the cheers of the audience.) Look for the dude/dudette running sound. Point to the cable in the output jack of your guitar and yell/say ""AM I GOOD TO GO?!"" Then wait for them to give a thumbs up or something. Give them some time to mute your channel before you unplug.

If you prematurely un-jack-ulate your guitar through the sound system you will most certainly get annoyed ""aawwss"" from the crowd. It could damage their equipment. You'll get embarrassed. The sound guy will hate you. And that one girl will crumple up the napkin with her phone number on it because she would never bed someone so unprofessional.

Seriously though, sound guys thank me all the time for this simple courtesy. It makes you look thoughtful, makes the sound guy like you more, crowd doesn't have to deal with that annoying as fuck ""chu-gunk"" sound. 


**TL:DR -** Make sure you're channel is muted before you unplug you're guitar from the PA.

**Edit:** Okay folks, I'm glad this is getting attention. Let me put some caveats in here.

* First, I fucked up your/you're but I'm not one to run from my mistakes. It's getting left. But I'm also a smartass and changed a different one. So, there's that.
* Secondly, there's A LOT of great replies in here that address how to handle this issue at different levels of professionalism. See [erietemperences](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1jujau/heres_a_tip_for_all_you_acoustic_guitar_players/cbilgio)'s reply to see what you'd expect at higher levels of play. (Which, kudos to you if you're there.)
* There's also a lot of tips for what people could/should buy in order to take a more active part in preventing it from happening in the first place. I collected a couple here: [mysteryweapon](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1jujau/heres_a_tip_for_all_you_acoustic_guitar_players/cbiksxz), [karmission](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1jujau/heres_a_tip_for_all_you_acoustic_guitar_players/cbippxa), and [travvvvvvv](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1jujau/heres_a_tip_for_all_you_acoustic_guitar_players/cbiixsa).

1345926986.0,472,self.Guitar,ytkh4,Dear guitarists: How to sound good playing live.,Peteriffic,554,82,259,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/ytkh4/dear_guitarists_how_to_sound_good_playing_live/,"Hi r/guitar. Some recent discussions here and there have prompted me to make this post about live sound and playing live. I play guitar, and I am an audio engineer (I.E. sound guy). I am the head of A/V and sound for my university, and I mix live on a regular basis. I also have a minor in music, and play live on a more occasional basis. That being said, I have a few tips/suggestions for all of you playing live on how to sound good because guitarists are among the most unruly people to mix for. 


1. The soundguy is your friend, and it is actually his primary mission to make your band sound as good as it possibly can. So many times I see people who think that I am there enemy when I tell you to turn down, or to do such and such. The thing is, when soundguys are asking you to do something, its not because they don't like your tone or are hating on you, its because they need to make everything sound good to the audience. Soundguys are uniquely positioned in this role, and often know the room or venue loads better than you do. They are trying to prevent you from sounding like crap.

2. Turn down. Amp volume is the #1 issue. The only time that your amp volume isn't an issue is when you're playing large large venues that are outdoors, or huge stadiums. If your amp is too loud, we can't control the sound or do anything about you sounding bad. You might be totally drowning out the vocals and keys. I get that you dig your tone, but really, so few peope actually hear your perfect tone, or even notice a difference. Most of the time, your tone is going through your guitar cable, probably 20-30' of wires in your PB, into another cable, into your amp, into a 57, a 20' cable, to a 100' snake, into a soundboard/outboard gear, into a power amp, into another cable, and FINALLY into somebodies ears. Turning down isn't going to make your tone terrible. It is going to actually give me some power to make it sound good again through EQ and other things. I can make you cut through a mix no problem, but if you turn up, you've just destroyed the rest of the band's sound. Honestly. 

3. You don't need anything above maybe 30w to play live. Its possible to play a 30k stadium gig with a blues junior. The lower your wattage, the higher you can turn your volume knob without sandbagging the rest of the mix. It is also nice because you retain that tone. If you gig live regularly, I really suggest you invest in a low wattage amp. There are plenty out there and they are pretty affordable. Plus, they weigh less, and use less tubes (saves $$). Sure, keep your higher wattages around for gigs where you might need to have a little volume, but these are few and far between for the average band. 30w is a lot, you probably won't get passed 3 on the volume knob, and even less for higher wattages.

4. The tone you get in your bedroom is different from the tone you track an album with is different from the tone you play live with. In live sound there are a ton of variables to consider that you don't have to worry about on an album, practice, bedroom, etc. Sound is a living breathing thing (to borrow an expression), and live there is so much more that goes into making your band sound great. Most of the adjustments, if not all, can be done by the soundguy and the parametric or compressors. However, there are occasions where he might ask you to change your tone a bit, or adjust volume, or whatever. If you have a totally mellow  tone that just sounds beautiful in your practice space, awesome. However, in a venue packed with 200 people and a full band it is so easy for it to get lost and lose all clarity and punch. This is where I come in as a soundguy. I might boost your guitar at 600Hz for some more body, I might cut at 5kHz because your guitar is sounding tinny or is too harsh, I might cut below 120Hz (almost every sound person does this), to give some room to the bass and the drums. Likewise, notch at 2.4 kHz to give the vocals some room in the mix, increasing presence there. All of this changes venue to venue and band to band, but the idea is that I have to make room in the sonic spectrum for everyone, and I have to make sure you sound good at the same time. There is a lot more thought that goes into a live mix than what you do at rehearsal, right? So please, don't feel hurt that I am asking for anything, remember, the soundguy is there to make YOU sound good. If it sounds good, they will congratulate you. If it sounds bad, guess who gets blamed? I do. Often times someone will come up to me and say ""the guitar sounds really harsh, or that bass is just killing everyone in the front three rows"", and there is nothing I can do about it. 


5. Please be on time to soundcheck. This is pretty simple, but you'd be surprised how many people arrive late and don't pay attention and don't listen to the soundguy during line checks. Line check is the one time I get to make sure that y'all sound good before anyone else is listening. When a soundguy asks you to play your loudest, play your loudest. When he asks you to give him the lowest dynamic, do that too. All of these things are so that we can make YOU sound good. It makes no sense to me when bands disregard line checks. Again, I'm not just some nerd behind a bunch of switches happy I get to order around a band. I am literally the only one who can tell you what you sound like with ears that know what they're hearing. Please remember that!

6. On the flip side, every soundguy isn't going to be perfect, or even any good at all. Don't make a blanket judgment about all of us just because one or two sucked. We are trying hard to make everything work, and have a lot on the plate. Just give us some room to work. Don't be a dick (something that applies to everyone in every job).

Me: Billy-Bob.

Bartender: Billy-Bob, I'll tell you what, I saw you playing last time, and you are great!  

Me: Wow, thanks!

Bartender: So, I bought my daughter a fender strat, and I have a question.

Me (thinking she wants me to give lessons or set up the guitar or something): Go for it.

1. Spend 8 hours a day surfing the web reading gear reviews trying to ""find your sound."" Trying to ""find your sound"" can be exhausting, so rationalize that you don't need to practice after you're done surfing.
2. Never tune your guitar. Tuning is for losers.
3. Make sure you never, ever practice with a metronome. Rhythm is also for losers.
4. Instead of spending time studying actual music, learn one scale at 600 beats per minute and only play that for the rest of your life.
5. Remember that there's no such thing as too much gain.
6. Find only fault in the playing of others... especially critically acclaimed, platinum selling artists. You can't learn anything from those sellouts anyway. (Note: Excludes Kirk Hammett)
7. Avoid playing with musicians who are better than you are at all costs.
8. If you are forced to play with highly skilled musicians, don't learn from them. Instead, spend lots of time giving them advice on how to play their parts.
9. Adjust your strap so your guitar hangs down around your ankles, despite the fact that you can't play at all in this position.
10. Only play and listen to one genre of music. Insist for the rest of your life that everything else sucks.
11. Convince yourself that you don't sound good because of some piece of gear that you can't afford, which, if you had it, would instantly transform you into Steve Vai.
12. Practice in front of a mirror, not so you can watch your hands (which would actually help), but so you can work on your sneering, pouting and posing.
13. Only play solos. Losers play rhythm guitar.
14. Practice the exact same way every day. Never change your approach to anything even if you spend hours a day with the guitar and never seem to get any better.
15. Have no patience with yourself whatsoever. If you try to learn a new skill and are not instantly successful, abandon all hope, swear and throw things around the room. Stop practicing immediately and spend a week feeling sorry for yourself.
16. Believe that you are entitled to greatness.
17. Assign responsibility for your progress to your teacher. If you're not getting any better, it must be someone else's fault.
18. Only learn Yngwie licks (badly). Everything else is just garbage that's too easy.
19. Only learn Nirvana songs. Everything else is just garbage that has no substance.
20. If you're having trouble learning a new lick or riff, clench your jaw and ""try harder."" Still no luck? Clench your jaw even tighter and ""try even harder."" Still nothing? Well... keep that up and let me know how it goes.
21. Convince yourself that great players became great on talent alone... and if you just don't have it, you just don't have it.
22. Consume as much instructional material as you possibly can (video, method book, magazine) but never, ever attempt any of the examples.
23. Don't bend to pitch. It takes too much effort to learn and it's really not a big deal anyway.
24. Refine and perfect the most asymmetrical, arhythmic, sickly sounding vibrato possible.
25. Quit.

Should we make this happen?,Kosepaul,539,111,203,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/w2pj8/the_reddit_guitar_lottery_should_we_make_this/,"Hi! I got an idea about making a Reddit Guitar Club / Guitar Foundation. Playing guitar can be expensive for some people, especially if you are only satisfied with high quality equipment.

So, why don't we throw 10$ in a ""reddit bucket of money"" a couple times a year, and a random winner will get 1000$ to spend on a nice guitar?


Let's say we get 100 people donate 10$ to the guitar bucket, and a random winner (or someone who deserves it, decided by vote?) will get the money to spend on a guitar. The requirements are that the winner must submit pictures and a full review about what he/she bought.

Are you interested in this, /r/guitar? Considering we have 43.870 subscribers, it shouldn't be too hard to fill the bucket. And would you spend your 10$ on something valuable anyway?

Please upvote if you like the idea, shout if you think something should be done differently, or if you don't think it will work out.


Edit: Also, do you think the winner should be chosen randomly or by vote? If we chose randomly I have figured out how it should be chosen, without people thinking it is fixed. I will list all the people who contributed from 1-100 (or whatever), and then I'll film when rolling, using www.random.org.

Edit2: Thanks for the replies! It seems like people are interested in this.

1. It will be a random winner.

2. We have to figure out if this is legal or not. If it is legal in Norway (my country), would US and other citizens be able to participate legally, even if these kinds of lotteries are not legal in their home country? Any help about this is appreciated!

By the way, in Norway a lot of businesses have ""art clubs"" (not sure if this is a very normal thing or not) where everyone pays a small amount and one person gets a painting every month or so. Maybe this is legal because it goes on rounds, instead of the lottery-style.

3. I also think we should have a luthier make the guitar. But do you guys think we should decide (in company with the luthier) what kind of guitar should be made, or should the winner decide that for himself?

There are pros and cons on both options here. Decide by vote?

1358432619.0,409,self.Guitar,16r385,A few thoughts for the frustrated 'Bedroom Guitarist',DigitalClarity,483,74,167,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/16r385/a_few_thoughts_for_the_frustrated_bedroom/,"I was until this morning, perhaps like many of you, a frustrated bedroom guitarist.  Frustrated by a lack of progress and/or ability, frustrated by a lack of depth in my playing, by my lack of technique, frustrated by my own inaction to correct this.  It's taken me 9 years to finally overcome the hurdle created by bad technique, lack of knowledge, and laziness, and this morning I finally broke out.  There's some thoughts I wanted to share.

I started playing when I was around 16, got my hands on an electric guitar and a dodgy practise amp and proceeded to learn all my favourite songs piece by piece.  Over the course of three years I fudged my way clumsily though most of my heavy metal favourites (Metallica, Iron Maiden, Pantera) whilst paying no attention to technique and music theory. I'm sure there are many of you who've had a crack at that Battery/Master of Puppets solo only to be left frustrated and disappointed, mostly because your hands simply aren't adept enough regardless of how many times you practise.

Dejected, I eventually put the electric down, thinking I just wasn't made to be a good guitarist.

5 years later (a few months ago) I pulled my old electric guitar out from my parents garage, and having seen it quietly rust from it's former glory, found a new determination to give it another go.  This time I was going to do it properly.  That being said, where do I even begin...??  So many articles, books, tutorials, resources. All I knew was that if I was ever going to seamlessly rip out a beautiful blues solo that raises the hairs on your neck, I wasn't going to do without some self discipline.

Why am I telling you all this?  Well, perhaps you identify with me. Not progressing, not feeling fulfilled by what you can achieve with the guitar, and not knowing where to even start to 'break out'.  As such I'm writing my thoughts and recent revelation to encourage those who have reached a hurdle, a wall, a stumbling block, to PUT DOWN the guitar tabs, to stop just playing along to your favourite songs mindlessly, and follow these 2 very simple steps. 

**Technique**: Spend whatever you can spare per day doing careful, rhythmic, finger exercises with a metronome [example](http://www.effective-lead-guitar.com/images/four-finger-exercise.gif).  If you don't have a metronome, do the exercises to the beat of a background song or a ticking of a clock.  Focus on every note sounding just right with no overlap, buzz or mess.  Start slowly, be mindful, really focus and teach your fingers.

**Theory**: If nothing else, please please learn the minor pentatonic scale.  Music theory can be tremendously overwhelming, I know this having spent the last few months trying to find SOMETHING that doesn't bombard me with too much too soon (still haven't found anything).  If you've learned the minor pentatonic scale through practise and repetition, you will very quickly be able to easily jam/improvise over the top of your favourite tracks.

After only a month or two of doing just these 2 things above, I have already advanced far beyond and skill level I achieved fudging through years of song tabs.  This morning I spent 2 blissful, euphoric hours improvising and tearing melodic, sweet riffs and solos over the top of BB King's 'Greatest Hits', it felt awesome...  A reward for being disciplined with my learning.

Good luck guys, for those who looking to 'break out' of the unfulfilling routine, hope this helps.

Just a little sidenote: These observations may seem obvious to those who are fluent in both technique and theory, but for those just starting the journey without a teacher, it's VERY difficult knowing where to begin.

A while back I bought an Ibanez RG370DXZ, which was my first every purchase of a 'new' guitar. I made a huge mistake in buying it, as I realised that I rarely used the whammy bar, the locking nut and floating bridge were just inconveniences to me, as I would like to play in different tunings.

I'm currently looking to buy a Les Paul of the Epiphone brand, as it's all I can really afford. I guess if I had to put a label on what I want 'my' sound to be, the guitarist I'd have to compare it to is Slash.

* The first Les Paul I looked at is the Epiphone Les Paul Custom Prophecy Plus EX. It seems to be quite good value, what with the free hard case, 24 frets, slimmer neck, and active EMG's (81/85). Now I know that active EMG's probably won't get me the tone I'm looking for, but they can be close.

* Other than that, I've just been looking at some Les Paul Standard's, PlusTops and some others with Epiphone/Gibson brand pickups and then just swapping them out for something better.

* I know the amp is a big factor in tone as well, so I'm looking to buy a Marshall MG50CFX or something similar, to replace my Fender Mustang I.

As you can probably tell from the questions, I am very much a novice guitar player. What would you guys recommend?

**EDIT:** Thanks for the advice so far, it's awesome! I guess the whole ""don't upvote"" thing doesn't really work.

**2nd EDIT:** Holy Jesus, this is a lot of awesome advice. A lot more than I was expecting, really appreciate it!

(Rant incoming)",runpmc,576,167,143,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1csgdo/if_youre_gigging_please_dont_do_this_rant_incoming/,"I play in a 3-piece band. Me, guitarist/singer, a bassist/singer, and a drummer. We've been gigging around town for a couple years now. That's the background.

We've been forming a relationship with a local bar over the last 2 years or so, playing monthly gigs and dropping in for the occasional fill-in slot. It has been going reasonably well, and we've bent over backward to make it work with these people...and they for us. We got a call from them three days ago, asking if we could fill a closing slot tonight for a blues/classic rock cover band. We said yes, absolutely. 

Turns out our drummer's had a trip to Las Vegas planned for some time, so he's out. No problem. When we're shy a drummer, we bring acoustic instruments and a kick drum, and do a set of covers with a few originals mixed in. Acoustic guitar, bass, kick drum, both vocalists. It goes over very well, we always get drunks shouting oddball requests at us and we consider it a point of pride to make it happen. (For example, tonight in the same ten-minute span we had requests for Justin Bieber and Black Sabbath. Played 'em both, to the delight of the crowd.) Long story short, we are aware that our job is to make the crowd happy and keep them drinking, and this we do cheerfully if not soberly.

The problem, however, was the band we were covering for. They finished their set, took 30 minutes to break down, and then they all split. I mean, they were gone before we played a note. And, because of the delay, so was their crowd. We were there for their set, applauding, drinking, supporting them, supporting the bar, but when it came time for us to get up—on a night, I should add, when we were *bailing them out*—they couldn't be bothered to stick around for even 15 minutes on a Saturday night. They didn't even say ""thank you, stick around for (name of our band).""

That band played okay, but next time they need help they won't get it from us. And bar owners and other bands talk to each other. Not only will they not have an easy time booking that bar again, but they're going to develop a reputation for being dicks...which will sink a group faster than anything else I can think of.

If you have a band playing behind you, it is your obligation as a professional to do two very simple things:

1. **Get your shit off the stage in a timely manner**—While you're setting up and playing, your boutique amp and favorite vintage guitar are the works of art you cherish more than life itself. When your set is finished, your gear is shit and it is in the way. Get it out of the way.

2. **Support the other bands**—You don't have to stay for their whole set, but you at least hang around long enough to catch a couple songs, have a drink, and support the bar while they're going on. Give them a shout out from the stage. You are not above them—they're on the same shitty bill as you. They are your co-workers, and the bar is your employer. Forget that at your peril.

TL;DR—Don't be a dick to the other bands you play with.",,False,,t5_2qi79,False,,,True,t3_1csgdo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1csgdo/if_youre_gigging_please_dont_do_this_rant_incoming/,

I did everything around the house and worked (just cutting lawns back then) to help her because she was basically bedridden . 

Fast forward to now, I'm 18 and about a month and a half ago I came home and there was a guitar in my room next to my other instruments (I also have a drumset and 2 basses that I bought) 

I went to ask my mom what it was doing there and she said ""I feel bad that you've worked for everything your whole life and I have never been able to get you anything so I got you a guitar, I hope you like it. I thought it looked pretty cool""

I was excited to finally learn to play guitar but something always bugged me and it was where she got the money. Turns out instead of buying her pain medication she bought me a guitar and a pedal.

The next week she committed suicide. To make matters worse my ""family"" came in and ransacked the house while I was at the funeral home and took everything of value out of the house.

 *I'm really hoping that I have all of these notes correct. I've checked, double-checked, and than re-double-checked. Let me know if you see something out of place.*

 
  I've been playing a LOT of ukulele recently and in an effort to learn my scales on it I created a chart. I decided that I should create a similar one for guitar. I *had* created a chart about a year or so ago, but it was split into 5 different chunks instead of 3, and 5 the chunks really didn't flow that well into each other; there was no overlap between them. I've been thinking long and hard about making a chart that has the scale shapes split in a way that is both efficient and fairly easy to learn. This chart is my latest attempt. 

  You might be thinking to yourself ""Why would I memorize all three shapes when I could just memorize the left and the right one?"" Since they have all the notes that are in the middle shape, you certainly could do that, and that's what I've done up until now. The problem for me comes when I try to travel from one scale to the other in a seamless way. I get lost and trip up far too often. The middle shape keeps me from losing my place as much and makes the transition between the shapes easier to remember. I could actually add yet *another* shape which combines shape 1 and 3 from the reverse direction, instead of from left to right, it'd be from right to left. I'm *trying* to keep things simple though so I've decided to leave that one off for now.

  If you've not learned a scale shape before, I recommend picking and memorizing one at a time, moving on only when you  have a good grasp of the one you've chosen first. 

  **If you're not familiar with scales or how to use them, here's my attempt at an explanation of how to use this chart.** 

  The red dots with the big M represents the starting point for playing in the Major scale (if an M dot lands on a G note, you're playing G major). The small m represents the starting point for playing the minor scale (if a small m lands on E, you're playing E minor). The black dots are notes that fill in the rest of the scale and they don't have any particular importance in my chart. The dot that has ""3b"" inside of it is the note that gives the Blues scale a bluesy sound. In fact, this note is often called the blue note. 

  **All of the below applies to the Major/minor scale**, but can easily be applied to the Pentatonic and Blues without issues. 
  
  Let's say that you want to play the A major scale using the left shape. To play this, you slide the scale around until one of the big ""M"" dots land on a A note. In the left shape, the big M is on the G string, 2nd fret. Coincidentally, this is where you're going to play this shape on the fretboard. If that one note all the way to the left in this shape is on the first fret, then your big M lands on A, and you're playing the A major scale. 
  
  Now that you're playing the A major scale, try noodling along with a song that's in the key of A. ""Fake Plastic Trees"" by Radiohead is in A, so is ""Help"", by The Beatles. If you good off in those scales while listening to these songs, it will sound more or less fine. Slide everything up or down a fret and you'll hear just how bad it can be to play along in the wrong key. In order to play in a different key, just slide your shape around on the fretboard until one of the big M's lands on the major key you want, or one of the little m's for the minor key you want. This will require you to know some notes on the fretboard, otherwise you'll never know what key you're playing in. [Here's a picture of the notes on the fretboard](http://playingelectricguitar.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/guitar-fretboard-notes.jpg) that I pulled up after a few seconds on google. 
  
  If you wanted to you could only learn this shape and noodle around in this position forever but if you want to play A Major further up the neck then you're going to have to play a different shape. Or rather, add another shape to this one. That's where you use the middle shape in my chart.

Sorry YouTube commenters, but even Kirk Hammett is better than you are, and it's because you suck so bad that you can't understand why that's the case, no matter how atrocious his vibrato is.

This highly relevant **[photography learning curve](http://www.natashaleighblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/A-photographers-learning-curve\(pp_w860_h721\).jpg)** visualizes this effect very well.

My takeaway? Thinking you suck means you suck less than you think. 

\m/

EDIT: Thanks go to tarkpea for the photography learning curve! Also, I want to clarify that I think Mr. Hammett is a good guitarist who is picked on far more than his fair share. I could have replaced him with any other favorite-guitar-player-of-non-guitarists who gets criticized by hacks for not being a perfect instrumentalist. I feel this is different from just not liking him. If you think he uses too much wah or something, that's totally cool and unrelated to this. That's just taste. My point is just that playing a high energy 90-minute set with leather pants, sweaty hands, and a  rhythmically super-tight, technical repertoire is very, very hard to do. Live music ain't no cakewalk, fun as it is. So I included his example to attempt to defend him from imagined YouTube haters because I dislike it when people who don't know what they're talking about demean the thousands of hours of work people put in to get to the level of a ""shit"" player like Kirk Hammett.",,False,,t5_2qi79,1358957891.0,,,True,t3_172ihp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/172ihp/the_dunningkruger_effect_or_why_you_think_you/,

1363972020.0,356,self.Guitar,1at459,Things that I've learned after playing guitar for just over a decade,ststephen420,445,89,257,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1at459/things_that_ive_learned_after_playing_guitar_for/,"So I see a lot of new guitarists on here and I wanted to share some of the insights i have had about playing guitar over the past ten years that I feel like aren't obvious or get overlooked. So here it goes:

1.) I'm gonna start off by beating a dead horse here. Tone is in your fingers. Jimmy page sounds better on a start knockoff then you do on a prs. Money doesn't make you better at guitar, only time does.

2.) Play acoustic guitar. I don't care what style or genre you play, acoustic guitars make you a better player. You can't hide poor technique behind gain or effects on an acoustic. Your mistakes are naked and there for you to hear, acknowledge, and improve. 

3.) Don't rely on pedals to make interesting sounds. This is tied to the last point but is different in some ways. Relying on effects pedals to create interesting music is a really good way to end up repeating yourself. 

4.) It's better to play the wrong note at the right time than the right note at the wrong time. the best jazz players make a career out of playing 'wrong notes' well

5.) Extrapolating on my last point further:  there are no wrong notes. You can play any note over any chord, if you contextualize the note properly, play it with confidence, and are rythmically sound. 

6.) There is nothing you can do to cheat at guitar. If you want to be a good guitar player you have to put the time in, end of story.

So that's it for now. I will be checking in throughout the day if this thread takes off to answer any questions you might have about the ideas I presented. Hopefully this will lead to good discussion, or at the very least help somebody become a better player. Rock on

edit: so it seems like there's a lot of interest on the topic of playing the wrong note at the right time. I'm going to make a little bit of a video lesson when I have some spare time(might ne a couple days) and post it in its own thread. I will also be making a video of some dead covers and posting that as well by request. I will probably make a new thread for that as well as posting a link in the comments. Thanks for all the feedback and interesting counterpoints in the comments, you guys rock

edit: so after reading through the comments you guys made I figured I'd come back and clarify a few things. First I just want to say that everything I wrote is obviously just my opinion, and is meant to be taken as such. I am merely sharing my experiences, not trying to project my ideas onto others. I'm gonna go through each of the original statements by number:

1.) I'm not trying to tell anybody that a nice guitar doesn't sound or play better than a budget guitar. Obviously a finely crafted instrument is going to be superior and that's why many great players have expensive custom guitars. But none of it is necessary to being a great player. The only thing necessary to become a great guitarist is the drive to keep working at it and a functioning guitar.

2.) I'm not saying acoustic is better than electric. And I'm not saying stop playing your electric and play exclusively acoustic. I'm saying if you don't already mix some acoustic guitar playing with your regular playing, give it a shot. Playing acoustic has a lot to offer. It helps build strength and finesse that an electric guitar won't(and the same could be said of electric to acoustic). They're two very different instruments that each can teach you different things. Honestly the better statement to be made in retrospect would be: If you exclusively play acoustic or exclusively play electric, you should try mixing it up either way. 

3.) Again, I'm not saying don't ever use pedals. I'm saying don't rely on them. They can create a lot of sounds that can't be imitated in any other way, and in some ways can be like instruments all to themselves. But you still have to be doing something musical for anybody to care. 

4-5.) This statement seemed to me to get the most mixed feedback. Some people totally agree, others totally disagree. And still others fall somewhere in between. Notes can sound right or wrong, it's all perception. but you can shape perception by the way you play certain notes. If you play an off color note confidently and intently, it comes off as a ""right"" note. If you play that same note overcautiosly and slightly off-beat, it sounds like a gaff or ""wrong"" note. This is all just perception however. Some people think miles davis sounds band, i tend to disagree. I intend to do a little video on monday to discuss this particular topic further. I will post here when that happens.

6.) this seemed to be the only thing that nobody seemed to take issue with. I guess retrospectively it seems self-evident. But at the time it felt right, so I'm glad I said it.

Thanks again for all the feedback, both positive and negative. And just remember, none of this is meant to be law to live by, just one person's experience.

He said he was looking for a working band to hook up with because he missed playing live since he left his old town. He showed us some phone pictures of a bunch of very impressive looking equipment and said he had a separate rig just for gigging.

The band's lineup right now is vox, bass, drums, guitar(me).

He seemed okay, so we invited him to come to a rehearsal and play with us. I gave him our entire printed set list, which included about 100 tunes and chords, arrangements and performance notes for each one.

1)First, he showed up 45 minutes late for a three hour rehearsal. 

2)Then, in order to see his chops at their best, we asked him which of our tunes he wanted to do first. He said, “I don’t care. I can play all of them.” (All 100? Hmmm…)

3)I figured that Comfortably Numb would be a good way for him to show us how ‘pretty’ he could play. (And, as a selfish note, I wanted to hear the keyboard behind me during the solos). He used a distortion sound that nearly broke my ears.

4)Instead of playing the chords, he riffed for the entire time (over the lyrics and over Gilmour’s brilliant solo). He never once played a chord.

5)So, I asked, “Do you have the set list I gave you?” He replied, “I don’t need it. I’ll just wing it.”

6)So we soldiered on… for every song we played, he riffed over the entire thing, flailing around at first to find the key (I have to admit, though, that once he found the key, at least he stayed in it.

7)Knowing fully well that we have scheduled gigs coming up all throughout the summer and limited time for rehearsals, he began to go off on tangents between tunes, playing something and asking, “You guys want to add this one? This one? This one?”

He was not asked to become a member of the band.

So, I guess the moral of the story is, if you want to join a working band, learn your material, learn your place in the mix, don’t ever “wing it”, use appropriate sounds for the tune you’re playing and don’t distract everybody from the ‘business’ of being a band

Sorry... needed to rant for a wasted night.

1370328941.0,344,self.Guitar,1fmzcn,Installed Tronical tuning system... my review,El_Nopal,374,30,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1fmzcn/installed_tronical_tuning_system_my_review/,"I just recently installed the Tronical auto-tuning setup on my Epiphone Les Paul Standard, and have been playing with it for a couple of days.  I had mentioned to some people in previous threads that I had ordered it and would review it once it was on the guitar and installed.  My Les Paul used the ""Type J"" tuner, so that is the model I am reviewing.

If you're not familiar with this system, it can be seen here: http://www.tronical.com/tronicaltune/

It is basically a robotic tuning system that tunes all 6-string simultaneously and automatically, with the push of a button, and features 12 pre-programmed tunings, and 6 user defined tunings.

**Why I purchased the system:**

I chose to install the Tronical system on my Les Paul because my current band requires me to switch between 4 different tunings:  Standard E, Standard E-flat, Drop D-flat, and drop-C.  Yes, I know there are many people out there who are like ""screw that, bring 4 guitars"", or ""spend $30 on a tuner and do it manually"".   These aren't really options I consider viable..  (a) I don't want to maintain or carry around 4 guitars, and (b) I don't want to make an audience wait for a couple minutes each time (an eternity in gig time) while I retune several times during a gig.  I wanted a quick, efficient alternative that allowed me to change tunings quickly and accurately.

**Ordering and receiving the tuning system:**

I ordered the system online, and it cost $299 + $64 shipping/handling - expensive as hell, but considering it's international I guess that's reasonable).  They said to expect 3 weeks before they even process your order, so I figured it would be months before I saw it.  I ordered it on May 1st, it shipped from Germany on May 16th, and arrived at my house in Seattle on May 31st.  

**What I received:**

The package includes the circuit board, 6 robotic tuning machines, rechargeable battery, charger, all mounting hardware, and a basic quick start manual on how to install.   You need to do to their website to download the operating instructions in .PDF format.  My only complaint here is that I wish they had an option for chrome rather than the plastic / bone looking tuners.

**Installation:**

The system bolted on my Epiphone quite easily and required no modifications whatsoever. It fits perfectly and looks like it came factory installed, other than two screw holes that were left behind by the Grover tuners that were previously on my guitar.  Installation took about 15-20 minutes.  On a scale of 1 - 10, with 1 being ""a monkey could install it"", and 10 being ""engineering degree required"", I'd rate this install a 3.  Super easy, but you need to pay attention at least a little.  My only gripe was that one of the nuts for securing the tuners seemed to be stripped out.  Fortunately they sent extras.  The installed system is light and does not add any noticeable weight to the head stock.  The tuner has 6 lights on in labeled eBGDAE (indicating standard tuning in reverse), and each light has about 10 different colors it can display to denote different functions / meanings when using the tuner.  They are easy to learn.

**Stringing the guitar:**

This was perhaps the most difficult part of the whole process, and there is definitely a learning curve to it.  The tuning machines do not have a hole in them like a typical tuner, instead you have to wrap the string up through a V-shaped notch on the tuner, wrap it around the top, and then secure it with a screw on lock nut.  This is really difficult to do the first try, because you have to hold the string wrapped around the tuning machine while screwing the lock nut on to the top of the peg.  Then you tighten the lock nut with a coin - they advise against using a screwdriver, as it may damage the robotic tuners.  

I found that I had to master holding both the end of the string, and the portion of the string that ran down the neck with one hand while securing the lock nut with the other.  Takes a little practice.  Also, you must clip the string end before you start winding, or it will unwind as you tighten it and you're back to the drawing board.   Another quirk is that you can only wrap the strings around most of the pegs 2 times at most, so you have to adjust to cutting the strings a little shorter than you might be used to.  I had to redo a couple of the strings when I first started because there was too much loose string to fit on the peg.  Once you have the lock nut tight, you can use the ""string winding"" mode on the tuner to tighten it up to the point you are ready to tune the whole guitar.  I used Dean Markley Classics Lite gauge (.009-.046).  You basically hit the ""up"" and ""down"" buttons on the tuner controls to manually wind the strings up and down.  Pretty cool, like this feature.

**Calibration:** 

It's recommended that you first tune to standard E and run your guitar through calibration mode (which requires the standard E tuning).  This basically sets the gain and interference levels for you.  It involves choosing an option from very simple menus, then strumming all 6 strings at once several times while the system adjusts to your guitar.  The lights flash red to tell you the strum, then turn green once they record the setting.  At that point you mute the string, and strum again when it flashes red again.  It takes about 6-strums to calibrate on average.

**Tuning:** 

This part is really slick.  You basically just select the tuning you want... there's two programmed banks, and one user defined,  You simple press the on button, choose the bank, then choose which tuning in the back you want, and hit the enter button.  The tuners start turning on their own.  You follow the lights on the back (there are 6 basic colors that define what you should do / what is happening).  It takes about 15-30 seconds to tune, depending on your accuracy setting.  I found that the lower accuracy settings were not good for tunings below standard E-flat, but it was weird that they had more trouble with the higher strings than the low ones.  I found that even with the accuracy set for maximum, the tunings weren't always perfect and occasionally required slight tweaking.

**Custom tunings:**

Programming custom tunings is quite easy.  You simply tune the guitar manually to the tuning you want to save, enter ""save"" mode, then strum each string one at a time until it gives you a green light.  Once you've recorded all 6-strings, it has to select which of the 6 slots you want to store it in, then you hit enter and all the lights flash green twice to indicate it was stored.  Easy breezy.

**Overall thoughts:**

The system seems to work awesome on standard E, and E-flat tunings, and the other pre-programmed settings.  It is quite accurate in these modes, and tunes it very close to perfectly every time.  There is some variation allowed in how close to the note it gets, so sometimes it's a cent or two off.  The default accuracy on this unit is +/- 2.5 cents. Even at it's most accurate, it is +/- 1 cent.  Most of the time it seems to be spot on, but there are variations.  This seems to get more flaky as you tune lower, and I don't think it would be reliable for tunings below C.

I will follow up on the system once I have had a chance to use it in a live situation, and after I've cycled through the tunings a few dozen times.  I'll also report on battery life and any other quirks I find.

Overall, I am happy with the system and will keep using it.  Even if I have to tweak a tuning a little, it's still way faster than doing it with a tuner.

Hope this is helpful to some people who might be interested in this system.

Edit:  Clarity.

Update:

**Daily use:**

Ran in through a full set at practice tonight, it worked flawlessly.  I even tuned it in a noisy space, other instruments at full volume, and it hit the tuning spot on.  I've figured out how to record the user-programmable tunings more accurately, and it seems to get it right every time now.  It would be pretty easy to do in the dark.

Learn these and learn them all the way through. Including the solos if applicable. Learning only pieces of a song is a very bad habit to slip into. The solos may seem impossible at first but keep listening to them and applying the tabs. You'll find that even if the tabs aren't 100% accurate, you'll learn a lot stylistically, and you can always fill in the wrong notes later. These songs are in order of difficulty (in my opinion of difficulty) and just focus on one at a time until you have each of them completely mastered. By the time you're done you will find most songs easy to learn. If you feel these songs are too hard to start with then just learn any two songs off of Metallica's Black Album and you'll be ready. 

If you're a beginner you will more than likely not learn these songs over night. Look at this as a one year goal. If you practice hard you'll have them all down in less than 6 months.

Nothing Else Matters - Learn all of it. It has a great solo for beginners.

Pride and Joy - SRV

Rain Song - Led Zeppelin, gets you playing with alternate tunings.

Babe I'm Gonna Leave You - Led Zeppelin, to help with finger picking

Time in a Bottle - Jim Croce, classical finger picking

Anything from Eric Clapton Unplugged album. Any song will do.

Intro to Crazy on You - Heart, final finger picking lesson.

The Ocean - Led Zeppelin

These next two really focus on the ""smooth"" factor, which is essential if you want to make every note sound the best that it can.

Lenny - Steve Ray Vaughn (SRV)

Little Wing - SRV version

Since I've Been Loving You - Led Zeppelin, mainly the solos.

The next three are difficult but not impossible. These will open your eyes to how versatile of an instrument the guitar really is. These tunes can be considered essential to your growth as a musician in general.

Mario Bros - This teaches you a lot of chords and everyone loves it.

Family Guy Theme song - another tough one that your friends will love.

Bohemian Rhapsody - Queen, this is really hard. Below is a link that has all of the vocal harmonies, guitar, and piano beautifully transcribed to together if you really want a challenge. 
http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/q/queen/bohemian_rhapsody_ver8_tab.htm

All of these (minus the Rain Song, it's surprisingly easy) will take a while to learn and perfect but I promise that you will come out of it a different guitar player who can easily stand up to most other players. Once you've learned the above mentioned songs, learn any SRV, Van Halen, and Zeppelin solo(s) of your choice. They'll 
all take you to the next level as a lead guitar player. After you're satisfied with that, move on to learning any David Gilmour solo. It's good to learn Gilmour later because after learning all of the above mentioned artists you'll find yourself playing faster, quite frequently. Gilmour has (almost) the perfect balance of speed and melody, though he could stand to rip it up a bit more occasionally. However, he's a great role model not only as a guitar player but as a musician in general. His styles teach to do what's best for the song and not your ego. You don't want to get stuck in a perpetual state of showing off (Steve Vai) or it just gets boring to the listener.

tldr; I traded redditor clockworkblk one of my custom instruments for a website for my custom guitar business, www.zoovguitars.com.


7 months ago I posted to this community asking for a good ol' fashioned trade [&lt;link&gt;](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/uwiox/i_make_zoov_guitars_and_i_want_to_trade_one_for_a/).  I was a struggling custom guitar builder and I *really* needed a website to showcase my work.  This seemed like a great place to turn since r/guitar is a reputable guitar-centric community filled with tech savvy people who could help me build such a page.


So I built [this guitar](http://www.zoovguitars.com/the-work/27-d1-6) for [this redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/uwiox/i_make_zoov_guitars_and_i_want_to_trade_one_for_a/c4zbih0) and he built me my new website www.zoovguitars.com.


It wasn't easy for me to mail 80+ hours of my very own blood, sweat, and tears across the country to a complete stranger from the internet; but the reputation of this community allowed me to disregard my inhibitions, and I mailed an instrument that I couldn't afford to lose, to someone that I didn't know, in exchange for something I couldn't do by myself.  I didn't have the money to pay a web developer and I still don't but I'm well on my way thanks to clockworkblk and r/guitar.


The feedback I have already received from complete strangers regarding my Art has been nothing short of amazing.  People I did not even know existed, who tell me that they have been following me for *years* through various pages such talkbass.com, are reaching out to send me messages of encouragement. These strangers bring me their questions as well -- ""how did you do it?""  And now to answer that question I'll have to mention all of you.


So thank you r/guitar for everything you've done for me and my business.

It had been broken, covered in house paint and neglected for years.  Last summer, when he came to visit her he brought the guitar and gave it to me, asking nothing in return except that I return the guitar to her original beauty.

I was blown away. 

I started by stripping the paint with Citristrip.  It was a bit of a pain in the ass, but not really that bad.  Once I had the guitar back to bare wood, I repaired the damage from previous repairs.  The headstock crack had been repaired with wood glue and screws.  I reseparated the crack, cleaned it up and then repaired it with hide glue and dowels.

There were also screws holding the neck in for some reason (completely unnecessary) so I removed them, drilled and doweled the holes.  All the left over damage was filled with a mix of wood glue and mahogany dust.

After final prep, the guitar was primed and then painted with spray can ReRanch black and original Les Paul gold nitro lacquer (made with the exact same brass dust used in the original stuff from the 50's).  Both Tinted clear and untinted were used for the final coat.  I used a mix of ReRanch and Minwax lacquers.

**UPDATE**

 - Added G Major sample


**UPDATE 2**

- Added A Major sample in addition to G major to demonstrate my tutorial

- Added Major Pentatonic

- Added Minor Pentatonic

**UPDATE 3**

- Changed colors of the graph chrome to be more neutral.

**SUMMARY**
This is a tool to both visually demonstrate scales &amp; to teach different positions on the fretboard.

**BACK STORY**

A while WHILE back I made a simple chart to help me learn my scales. It was very simple, but using it I was able to know all the positions on my fretboard. I was able to move from any fret to any other fret of any other string with ease after this. It taught me all the basics of visualizing the major scale on my guitar. 

As I moved on I figured out that the minor scale has all the exact same notes as its relative major, it’s just which note is emphasized. Therefore INSTANTLY I went from knowing the whole major scale and how to play it everywhere on the neck, I could now play the natural minor key in every single position on the neck as well. This was HUGE for my soloing. Just find the root of the song and then I could solo to any song I wanted the whole way through. 

Years went on and one day a while back I noticed a very odd relationship between colorscales &amp; musical scales. Twelve notes, you have certain ones that just give you a certain feel based on what’s paired together. I transposed the colors into notes and a lot of the relationships worked very similar. All day I worked out things that matched up and things that didn’t. At the end of the day I realized there was really nothing to apply all this information to. It was cool, but pretty useless. So I just saved what I learned and didn’t bother with it again.

Just recently I wondered if maybe visualizing the fretboard in colors like I had in those experiments. So I tried it and you can visually see patterns which I KNOW will help certain people who just are more visual people. As I was working on this simple thing I realized that my old scale graph could use a little updating, so I combined the two projects.

So right here is what all that work came together to form. I tried my best to polish it and make it look pretty using all the scale information that I discovered. So the major scale includes only colors in the graph that are in the major scale. The letters are the 3rd intervals of the scale. So each type of scale has an overall slight difference in visual look, the colors just come together in different subtle ways similar to how musical scales work.
I feel it comes together in a great visual aid combined with tools to learn all the positions.


**HOW TO USE IT** 

The current version includes:

-	Major Scale (Ionion Mode ) [C],

-	Natural Minor scale (Aeolion Mode) [A]

-	Dorian mode [D]


If I get a good response I’ll add all the modes, the pentatonic scales, &amp; the harmonic minor. 


So first start with the first page titled “Major Scale.” It looks similar to a fretboard, but the numbers up top aren’t the actual frets. They are the fret number relative to the key you choose. To the left is which string is which. Inside the fretboard area are all the scale degrees and a visual overlook of all the notes within the Major Key. 

Below that is the “Hand Positions” section, this has all five positions of the fretboard, where you will put your fingers.

Let’s begin with A Major with position one. 

We have to set the root at the 5th fret because A is on the 5th fret of both E strings. The numbers at the top are all relative to this specific note. So if it’s “+1” it would be the 6th fret currently. 

Now look at the bottom of the chart for hand positions, we’re starting with Position one or P1. The numbers on the position denote which finger you use the current position. Two of the positions you can use without having to shift side to side while going up &amp; down the scale. For other positions you will have to shift one fret left or right depending on which string you are on. 


So take your pointer finger (Finger 1) and set it on the 4th fret of the low E string. (Interval VII)

Take your middle finger (Finger 2) and set it on the 5th fret of the low E string (Interval I) (The Tonic)

Take your ring finger (Finger 3) and don’t fret, but have it above the 6th fret of the low E string, if you look, this note is not in the scale, so it’s not played.

Take your pinking (Finger 4) and set it on the 7th fret of the low E string. (Interval II)

So the main goal is to vertically move up the fretboard string by string without shifting (Because this position doesn’t have a shift it in it. So for position 1 your fingers will stay in these exact frets without moving. Go through in order I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, back to I. Then go down. 

Continue doing this to a metronome and try to memorize this position. Once you are able to play along to something using these frets and not use a reference for this position try another position.

How to develop finger independence?"" - a tip for those trying to learn fingerpicking",richardsolomon,390,74,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1hms6d/i_cant_play_two_things_at_once_how_to_develop/,"So you're trying to learn fingerpicking.  And if you're anything like me, you've always had trouble with instruments that involve playing two or more lines at once - picking guitar, piano, drums etc.

They always say practice one line on its own, then the next, and put them together.  That's good advice!  You should keep doing that.  It definitely helps.  Maybe it's the 'correct' way to do it, I don't know.  But for me it always seemed to [gloss over](http://mccreavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/owl.jpg) the actual sticking point - how exactly do you train your brain to *play two things at once?*

If this problem has a habit of stopping you dead in your musical tracks every so often, read on.  I'm going to share a piece of advice that may seem obvious to some, but when I figured it out it changed my playing.  I hope you find it helpful.

My problem was that I was overcomplicating things.  Just ""putting two lines together"" isn't as simple as it appears, especially if your brain has been doing one thing at a time your entire life.  The trick is to remember that a piece is simply a series of notes played one after the other, or at the same time.  That's it.  Let's put it in bold.

**A piece of music is simply a series of notes played one after the other or at the same time.**

Can you play one note after the other?  Of course you can.  Can you play two or more notes at once?  Certainly.  That's what a chord is, after all.  Let's take a look at an example.  Here's a simple picking part:

    E--------------------------3p0-------------------
    B--------1--------------------------1------------
    G-----------------0--------------------------0---
    D--------2-----------2-----------2-----------2---
    A--3-----------------------3---------------------
    E--------------3-----------------------3---------

That might be a tiny bit more complex than an absolute beginner would be expected to learn (I would recommend finding a simpler exercise), but I'm trying to illustrate a point here, and what I say applies to *all* pieces.

If you were to split this up into two lines (bass and melody) it might look like this:

**Melody:**

    E--------------------------3p0-------------------
    B--------1--------------------------1------------
    G-----------------0--------------------------0---
    D------------------------------------------------
    A------------------------------------------------
    E------------------------------------------------

**Bass:**

    E------------------------------------------------
    B------------------------------------------------
    G------------------------------------------------
    D--------2-----------2-----------2-----------2---
    A--3-----------------------3---------------------
    E--------------3-----------------------3---------

So you practice both these parts, but you still can't fit them together.  Never fear!  Remember, **a piece of music is simply a series of notes that are played one after the other or at the same time.**  So let's slow right down and take it step by step.  The first part looks like this:

    E------------------------------------------------
    B--------1---------------------------------------
    G------------------------------------------------
    D--------2---------------------------------------
    A--3---------------------------------------------
    E------------------------------------------------

You can play that, right?  Definitely!  It's just one note, then two notes together.  Simple!  Once you're comfortable with that, take a look at the next part:

    E------------------------------------------------
    B------------------------------------------------
    G-----------------0------------------------------
    D--------------------2---------------------------
    A------------------------------------------------
    E--------------3---------------------------------

That's even easier!  It's just three notes in a row, and not particularly challenging ones at that.  Slow it right down, practice it until you're comfortable.  I'm not being patronizing here: if you can't play it slowly, there's a good chance you're not playing it well.  Playing well and slowly is much, much tougher and more impressive than playing fast and sloppy.  Are you up to the challenge?  Of course you are!

Now play that first part, then the second.  

    E------------------------------------------------
    B--------1---------------------------------------
    G-----------------0------------------------------
    D--------2-----------2---------------------------
    A--3---------------------------------------------
    E--------------3---------------------------------

You know what you're doing now?  **You're playing two lines at once.**  Bass and melody.  Doesn't seem quite so intimidating now, does it?  Everything from here on is simply a matter of practicing and refining it until it sounds good.  And if you're enjoying yourself, you'll find that's a really satisfying process.

It doesn't matter how crazy the picking pattern looks, just follow this method and you'll get through it eventually.  Slow it down, take it two or three notes at a time, and don't worry about playing the bass/melody parts independently.  That'll come in time, I promise you.

I hope this has been helpful, thanks for reading.

**Edit:** Just thought of this - if you're looking for a simple song to learn picking, why not try a song I wrote when I was learning?  It's called Will o' the Wisp, and I wrote it for the specific purpose of helping me to learn patterns, with a tiny bit of melodic independence in the middle eight.

You can find the full tablature and lyrics [here](http://pastebin.com/rZcahfa4), and a poorly-recorded version of it [here](https://soundcloud.com/thewretchedryanenglish/will-o-the-wisp).  It's pretty easy and definitely helped me to consolidate the muscle memory.

1361712016.0,297,self.Guitar,194qh7,How to make your own guitar cables.,AwesomeColor,351,54,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/194qh7/how_to_make_your_own_guitar_cables/,"In another topic, someone asked for a How-To on how to make your own guitar cables. Rather than type up a long list of steps, I'm going to refer you to some of the resources that I found helpful and give a few recommendations. 

In my opinion, every budget-conscious guitarist should have a soldering iron and the basic skills to use it. It has probably saved me over a thousand dollars. You'll be able to build your own cables, replace your pickups, repair or make your own guitar pedals, and perform countless mods on your guitar. A 25W Weller soldering iron should serve your needs. It'll get hot enough for just about anything you'll need and it won't crap out on you. Stay away from Radioshack like the plague. Their solder and stuff may be fine, but **do not** use their irons. I think I went through 2 of them before I wised up.

I first got into this when I was building my first pedalboard and noticed the ridiculous prices for 6"" patch cables. ($28 is nuts) So I did some research to learn how to build my own. Once I realized the huge markup that some companies ask for with their cables, I started to research what it would take to start my own cable company. (I was bored and had a lot of time at work) For one, I found very little reasoning as to why certain cables were priced how they were. (6 extra inches of cable shouldn't cost $12 more)

FYI, I was not interesting in building cables that were special silver-plated, pixie dust infused, and soaked in unicorn blood. I don't buy into a lot of the mojo hype that some people may. I believe the electrons don't really care and that the only factors you should consider are build quality and capacitance (and you may not even care about capacitance).

First, you can read through this [link](http://audio.tutsplus.com/articles/general/quality-instrument-cable-why-it-matters-and-how-to-make-your-own/). 

I also found [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smg68qgJa-I) very helpful.

I have some soldering experience, but am by no means an expert. It took me about 2 hours to solder 5 patch cables for my pedalboard. I purchased all of my materials from [Redco](http://redco.com/). They had the lowest prices that I was able to find. Canare, Mogami, and Gepco were the bulk cable manufacturers I heard the best reviews from. I bought more cable than I needed at that moment to save on shipping costs, because I knew that I was going to need more cable in the future. I just didn't know how much.

For the patch cables, I used Mogami W2319 since it had a smaller diameter than the W2524 and I figured it would be easier to bend and twist around a pedalboard. I also build some cables to run from guitar to pedalboard and pedalboard to amp. For this I used Gepco XB20UB. Since these were longer runs, I wanted to keep the capacitance lower and the Gepco has only 22.3 pF/ft, which is a bit lower than the Mogami W2319 (47.3 pF/ft), Mogami W2524 (39.7 pF/ft), Canare GS-6 (49 pF/ft), and Canare GS-4 (47 pF/ft). The pF/ft is going to tell you the capacitance of the cable. This is important because a higher capacitance is going to cut some of the high frequencies from your signal. I'm not 'tone-crazy' like some people, but I figure it's a good factor to consider. The Gepco has shielding that is braided together, so it's tough to twist it up to solder it to ground. So, I would warn a first-timer that it may be tough unless they are up for a challenge. The shielding on the W2319 was much easier to solder.

For connectors, I went with Amphenol ACPM-GN and the associated right angle orientation. They were affordable and easy to solder. I had also heard recommendations for Neutrik and Switchcraft connectors, though I'd heard that Neutrik Silent plugs were prone to failure. I believe that's the reason that Lava Cable does not cover them under their warranty, and I'm not sure that they even carry them even more. I've never used a solderless system, but from the problems I've heard people having, it's not something I would ever try. With the research I did, I found that the only benefits that gold connectors really offer you is additional corrosion protection. It doesn't offer any additional *tone*. 

I hope that was helpful.

Today, I listened to every one of them, and I have never felt such a sense of accomplishment.  Riffs that I love now, I suddenly remember considering garbage at one point.  Its really cool to see how they have progressed in speed and how the style of playing it has developed.  I've even drawn inspiration from the past version of a riff because the new one needed something else in it. 


 I highly recommend recording yourself playing, or even just recording a few things you've come up with.  It helps you to realize that you're probably a lot better than you give yourself credit for.  It boosts your confidence, and helps to keep you from getting stale as a player.

In late February I ordered a set of 3 Lace Sensors from Musician's Friend.  I was a little excited, so I put them in the guitar without testing them first. After I got it all together, I noticed the neck pickup didn't work.  So I tested it with a multimeter, and sure enough, it was a bad pickup (I had really hoped it was my wiring.) So I got a return # from Musician's Friend and shipped it back early in March. Because I couldn't ship back just the one pickup that was broken, I had to tear the whole guitar down and pack everything back up.  They got my return processed in early March.  But then, it turns out the pickups I had ordered were on backorder, and they wouldn't be able to ship a replacement until April 22. Fast forward to today - I open up the box and test the neck pickup.  It reads bad again. So I take a closer look at the contents of the box and I am positive that it's the exact same box I shipped back to them.  

I called them, and they're doing another exchange.  This time they're paying for the return shipping.  But you would think that if they're going to send the same box and defective pickup, they wouldn't make me wait over a month, even with a backorder.  I probably won’t be buying from MF again anytime soon.",,False,,t5_2qi79,False,,,True,t3_1dakwa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1dakwa/musicians_friend_shipped_me_back_the_same_box/,

Hey everyone,
i'm Rob Swift, Philadelphia based instructor and lead guitarist for The Rivals. I've been teaching for over 10 years and I think the biggest problem beginner soloist have is that they are unsure of what to look for within their various positions. Because they lack understanding of how scales relate to the chords in the rhythm section, they fail to find intervals that either match or harmonize with the different chords...this causes an extreme continuity issue, and certainly produces that ""lost"" vibe, which no guitarist wants. I think this video I created can help to develop the mindset of a good soloist, and should instill some positive traits within your style.

It was back in the early 70's in rural Norfolk in the UK, I was I suppose 11 or 12 years old and had only just began to play guitar . I had an old archtop http://i.imgur.com/GCcwC.jpg, we also had a Bontempi organ which my brother played, my father's set of drums that a friend played and a mouth organ which our singer tried to play at times. We learn't a few songs, but the only two I can really remember playing are Morningtown Ride and Blue Suede Shoes. I can only assume that we sounded pretty dreadful. 

Because we were all in a Cub Scout group, we naturally enough called ourselves ""The Rock Cubs"", obviously none of us had ever heard of Professor William Archibald Spooner! In retrospect I do recall the adults sniggering when one night we played a few songs at the local village hall. However, it wasn't until many years later in the mid 90's when I went to see a band called ""Bagged Shandy"" (another Spoonerism in case you didn't notice) that the penny finally dropped and the full horror of calling ourselves the ""Rock Cubs"" struck. The reason for the sniggering became all to clear, it wasn't our dubious musical skills at all!

Over to you!

This is not a ""defend the Edge"" or ""fuck the Edge, he has a stupid name"" thread.  I'm honestly asking why, in a subreddit devoted to guitar, there seem to be people who are unwilling to recognize talent.

I don't know a single real musician who would actually argue that the Edge doesn't have talent.  You simply cannot get to the point that he (and his band) has gotten without it.  This isn't a band that was created by producers or hype, they wrote their own songs and they made it as a band in the way that every band hopes to make it - started small, lived on the road in a shitty tour van, had a couple hits, got bigger, had some more hits, got a couple breaks, and made it big.  Jesus Christ, they did everything exactly as you're supposed to do.  And it worked out for them.

And millions of people love their music.  And thousands of musicians count them among their influences.

Okay, fine, I get it - you like Eddie van Halen or Leo Kottke or Jimmy Page or Keith Richards.  Fine.  Those guys are insanely talented, too.  And each of them approaches the guitar, and writing music, in a different way.

Can you honestly tell me that you think someone like the Edge doesn't have talent?  Can you invent a style of playing guitar / creating music that inspires millions?

Do you like U2?  I don't really care, lots of people don't.  There are loads of musicians whose styles or music I absolutely loathe or just don't care much about.  But denying that someone has talent because you don't like their music is idiotic.

Want to talk about someone who, at first blush, seems to be fairly uni-dimensional in terms of guitar-playing?  Kurt Cobain.  Talented or not?

Stevie Ray Vaughan?  Standard blues through a Tubescreamer.  Talented?  Yep.

John Mayer?  His popular music is awful, but people on here *constantly* post about what an amazing guitarist he is.  And regardless of whether or not you like the popular stuff, he writes it, and a lot of people love it.  Isn't one aspect of talent being able to create music that stirs emotion in people?

Would you put Kurt Cobain in a room with John Mayer as a talented musician?  What about Stone Gossard?  Angus Young?  Brian Sutton?  Johnny Buckland?

What makes a talented musician?  You define a single metric, which a lot of people seem to be doing, and I'll show you someone who defies that metric and is considered enormously talented.

And that includes The Edge.  And Jimmy Page.  And Jack White, even though I can't fucking stand him.",,False,,t5_2qi79,True,,,True,t3_q7zne,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/q7zne/seriously_why_do_some_musicians_insist_on/,

1333646708.0,267,self.Guitar,ruw9v,Perspectives on the past 25 years of playing guitar.,808strafe,290,23,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/ruw9v/perspectives_on_the_past_25_years_of_playing/,"I started playing guitar in the summer of 1987.  I'm approaching the 25th anniversary of this event.  Playing guitar has been a tremendous joy in my life and I thought I would share some of the things I've learned and reflect on how things have changed.  **Now is the best time in history to be a guitar player.** Hopefully some of my old man redditor colleagues will be able to commiserate and share as well.

**The quality and selection of guitars available today is amazing.**  When I started, you could not find inexpensive guitars with high output pickups or Floyd Rose trems.  If it wasn't made in the USA or Japan, it was most likely garbage.  Fender Mexico did not exist yet.  Now Korean made guitars are very high quality, and Mexican Fenders are quite good as well.  You can get a great guitar with any features you want for under $500 (even less) just about anywhere today.

**Play what you want.  Play what you like.** What is considered a ""cool guitar"" today, may not be tomorrow, but it may be cool again the day after.  In 1987, the height of cool guitars was neon colored pointy headstock shred machines.  By 1991 anyone still playing a guitar like that was uncool.  Fast forward to today and Charvel has been bought by Fender and doing very well selling shredder hotrod guitars.  Another example: Harmony, Kay, Silverstone, Airline, and all manner of department store fiberglass guitars were almost universally considered to be unmitigated shit until guys like Jack White and Dan Auerbach picked them up and made cool sounds with them.  What is ""cool"" has no objective bearing on the guitars themselves.  Play what you want.  Play what you like.

**Never sell a guitar you love.**  If you have bonded with a guitar, love the tone, love playing, don't ever get rid of it... ever.  You will regret it.  I sold a 1991 Ibanez RG 760 in reflective Jewel Blue for $100.  It had an ebony fretboard with the original wizard neck, sharktooth inlays, the whole bit.  I sold it because it was uncool to be seen playing it.  It was, and still is, an amazing guitar.  To this day, it is still the easiest guitar to play I have ever owned.  It is painful to think about even now.

**Protect your ears.**  Amps and drums are dangerously loud.  I have permanent ringing in my ears from years of playing in bands, standing right next to cymbals and cranking my amp to be heard.  I'm 38 and may live another 50 years if I'm lucky, but every day I will have ringing in my head.  Wear ear plugs.  Protect your ears.  Save your hearing.

**Recording is amazing today.**  My first band recorded a six-song demo in a studio.  It cost us $1600.  We had enough money for one take of each tune.  Once mixed, we had an ADAT tape and one clean copy on cassette.  If we wanted to distribute our music, we had to make physical cassette copies.  CD duplication was incredibly expensive at the time.  Now you can record a demo on your iPhone.  If you write music, have a band, perform, whatever -- record yourself for posterity.  The quality you can get today is amazing compared to what was available in my lifetime and the cost is next to nothing.

**Practice really does work.** You will reach many plateaus with your technique.  These plateaus can be depressing as hell, and last weeks, months, or more.  You will run across things that are impossible for you to play at first.  You will be able to play them if you practice deliberately.  Never in 25 years have I failed to make improvement when I practiced something.  Some things came pretty quick to me, like speed picking and bending.  Other things were much more difficult, like in-tune vibrato and music theory.  If you work at it, you will get better.

**Every day I can play guitar, is a pretty good day.** Never give it up. Never put it away.

IC: Do you have any advice that you can give to young musicians aspiring to become professional musicians like yourself?  
  
GG: Don’t do it! It all ends in poverty and tears [laughs]. On a serious note, music is meant to be fun, and that’s important. Sitting in a room with a metronome, punishing yourself, playing arpeggios like they’re Hail Marys – that’s not going to make you love the instrument, or yourself. Some of that’s good, if the music you hear in your head requires that you have great technique, you have to work at great technique. But try to enjoy it. Remember that great technique is often about trying to make something feel easy. If you play something slowly lots of times, and pretend it’s easy, you get to the point where you can play it effortlessly for hours on end without tiring yourself out. And then one day, if you need to do it a little quicker, you find that you can. If something feels easy, that means you’re doing it right.  
  
  
The problem with the race against the metronome I think is that everyone tenses up, because they think they’re doing something difficult. That’s how you learn bad habits, and give yourself tendinitis and all of that bad stuff. So take it easy, try and make it sound good – sound is really important, and do something with your playing. Do some demos, write music, join a band, join five bands… have fun, sound good, be in time – obvious things.

[PETER FRAMPTON’S LOST GIBSON LES PAUL GUITAR](http://i.imgur.com/ITyVY.jpg) FOUND ON CARIBBEAN ISLAND OF CURAÇAO AFTER 32 YEARS 

TWO FANS COLLABORATE TO RETURN FAMED GUITAR

GUITAR PLAYED BY FRAMPTON ON HUMBLE PIE AND 
FRAMPTON COMES ALIVE! ALBUMS

Peter Frampton’s long-lost guitar was recently discovered after its disappearance in a plane crash 32 years ago. In 1980, a cargo plane carrying Frampton’s equipment for an upcoming show in Panama crashed, supposedly destroying all of the instruments on board including Frampton’s cherished 1954 Gibson Les Paul. Thanks to the unyielding work of two dedicated fans, one in Holland and one on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao, as well as the CEO of the Curaçao Tourist Board, Frampton was reunited with the guitar in an emotional meeting last month in Nashville, TN. 
The Curaçao Tourist Board helped acquire the guitar from an individual after hearing news that they may indeed have a lead on the long lost and beloved guitar. Together in Nashville, TN at the Gibson Custom Shop, with experts from Gibson Guitar and Peter Frampton, the team confirmed it was the original guitar long missing from Frampton’s collection.
Frampton’s custom guitar was given to him in 1970 by a man named Mark Mariana when Humble Pie played at the Fillmore West. Frampton borrowed Mariana’s guitar for the show and afterward tried to buy it from him, “But to my surprise he said he couldn't sell it to me—he wanted to give it to me!” he notes.
Frampton played the guitar exclusively on Humble Pie’s Rock On and Rocking the Fillmore albums. The guitar also appeared on a number of sessions for other artists including George Harrison, Harry Nilsson, and John Entwistle. Most notably, Frampton played the guitar on the electrifying Frampton Comes Alive!, one of the top-selling live records of all time.
Frampton is ecstatic to have the guitar back in his hands once again. “I am still in a state of shock, first off, that the guitar even exists let alone, that it has been returned to me. I know I have my guitar back, but I will never forget the lives that were lost in this crash. I am so thankful for the efforts of those who made this possible…And, now that it is back I am going insure it for 2 million dollars and it’s never going out of my sight again! It was always my #1 guitar and it will be reinstated there as soon as possible -- some minor repairs are needed. And, I just can’t wait to get Mark Mariana on the phone.”",,False,,t5_2qi79,False,,,True,t3_o1bzp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/o1bzp/peter_framptons_lost_gibson_les_paul_found_on/,

1351224252.0,259,self.Guitar,123vp7,Dr. StrangeGerd or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Truss Rod,,315,56,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/123vp7/dr_strangegerd_or_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying/,"Nothing instills more needless fear than the truss rod. Much like the spectre of Communism during the 1950's, there's a lot of screeching and podium pounding and terror throughout the land... but not much in the way of actual possible damage.

**What exactly does it do, anyway?**

Very short history lesson. At one time, guitars didn't have truss rods. This wasn't that big of a deal because the strings were made from feline interior components and put very little tension on the neck. Even today a lot of high end classical guitars do not use truss rods. They're seen as unnecessary due to the thickness of the neck and the low string tension. 

Fast forward a few years. Steel strings have become standard for most styles of music, but now there's a problem. Guitarists are wanting smaller necks than the typical classical style, but the tension from the strings causes the narrower and thinner necks to bow horrendously! ""Hey, I have an idea!"" said someone. ""Let's put a big chunk of metal in there. We'll bend it so we can twist it around and make the neck go back and forth so it'll counteract the force of the strings."" ""BRILLIANT!"" someone else said. Then they had a beer. Or five.

That's what it does. It counteracts the pull of the strings. I guess I could have just typed that, but where's the fun in that?

**Should I be scared?**

No. Hell no. A thousand times hell no with mustard. I'm not going to stand here and tell you to start cranking on a stuck truss rod on your granddad's closeted '65 Jazzmaster. There's a time and a place for everything. What I am going to tell you is that if you have any reticence about the truss rod you have been lied to quite a bit and need to stop worrying.

**What do you mean, lied to?**

Some of the most common ones...

- Turn the truss rod a quarter turn, then let the neck settle.
- Don't turn more than have a turn in a day.
- If you put too much pressure on it the truss rod will break the neck.
- If you take all the tension out the strings will break the neck.
- You can't fix a broken truss rod.
- Heavy strings cause warping
- Light strings cause warping.
- Dark elves live under the truss rod cover and will have sex with your dog if you dare go near it.

Stuff like that. To varying degrees there's some truth there, but what's needed is UNDERSTANDING.

**My dad knows this guy...**

So much misinformation is anecdotal. This guy I know knows a guy that knew this dude one time that had this luthier tell him about some other dude in Alabama that adjusted his truss rod and the neck broke and sent wood shards flying through the air, killing his infant twins. Well you trust your friend, he wouldn't propagate BS now would he?

Yes. Yes he would.

A little thought process turns most truss rod horror stories into easily debunked telephone game BS.

**Will you just get to the point?**

Yes. I will do so now. Going from the list above...

- Turn the truss rod a quarter turn, then let the neck settle.

Wood is an incredibly elastic material in certain ways, and it can indeed take some time to move itself where you want it to go. The thing is that if you overshoot all you have to do is turn the truss rod back the other direction. You can not adjust a truss rod enough to permanently harm your guitar... under normal circumstances. We will deal with the extraordinary circumstances at the end.

- Don't turn more than have a turn in a day.

The theory behind this is that the wood can only take so much stress one way or the other before it cracks or weakens or warps or whatever. Any woodworker will tell you how much you have to tweak wood before you hit that point. Here's a hint: It's far more than the adjustment range of a truss rod. Again this is based on the idea that the wood settles. It doesn't. But then again it might. We'll get to that too.

- If you put too much pressure on it the truss rod will break the neck.

Overtightening won't break your neck. Actually, that would probably be an easier repair than what actually CAN happen... breaking the truss rod itself, or stripping out the adjustment nuts. Breaking the neck isn't that difficult of a repair. Glue. Clamp. Wait. Fill. Sand. Rock out. Breaking the truss rod may involve a total fretboard removal to repair. So while you don't have to fear for the neck's wood you do have to keep from overtightening so you don't break the truss rod itself. It takes a LOT to get it to that point though. You'll probably determine the neck can't be adjusted before you get that far.

- If you take all the tension out the strings will break the neck.

No. They'll cause the neck to upbow considerably, which looks REALLY bad but doesn't usually lead to problems. There are the aforementioned extraordinary circumstances of course.

- You can't fix a broken truss rod.

I hear this one a surprising amount. It's not true, of course. But you still don't want to be careless. Repairing a broken truss rod can be the single most invasive repair possible on an electric guitar, and it's pretty damn high on the list for acoustics as well. Caution is advised. Paranoia is not. 

- Heavy strings cause warping
- Light strings cause warping.

The truss rod is there to provide equilibrium. It's there to counteract the force exerted by the strings, regardless of the actual string tension. I see people all the time saying you shouldn't use strings that are too heavy... or too light. I've got two names: Dick Dale and Billy Gibbons. They're about as day and night as you can get and neither of them has any issues keeping their gear in check. 

- Dark elves live under the truss rod cover and will have sex with your dog if you dare go near it.

That's just silly. It's the cat you have to be worried about.

**So what are these ""extraordinary circumstances""?**

Wood has two natural enemies. Water and fire. They have different effects on the wood but the ultimate result is the same. Tears, sadness, and massive repair costs. Wood loves to soak up moisture, as anyone that lives in a rainy climate can tell you. Acoustics sound dead at certain times of the year without proper care. Even WITH proper care sometimes. This is the main culprit when it comes to neck issues. High humidity can cause the fibers in the wood to swell up. If they do so in one area of a neck but not another... you now have a warped neck. Heat causes wood to expand, leading to the very same warping issues. The more extreme you go one way or the other the more your gear is going to get screwed up.

**Okay, so what's the point of all this?**

The point is, don't fear your truss rod. Don't treat it like it's kitten made out of butterfly tears and hope, that you somehow have to maneuver through a minefield. Wood is hardy. It can take the bending and the stretching and the jostling. What it can't take is water and fire. Exercise proper precaution when it comes to those two things and you'll find you will never have any sort of neck issues.

**An anecdote...**

Years ago I was a QC guy for a guitar manufacturer. Our warehouse was in Texas. No air conditioning. In the summer it would hover around 120F out there. Sometimes higher, especially close to the roof (it was a tall warehouse). When we had downtime we would pre-QC guitars. Under normal circumstances we'd only QC guitars when we received an order for them. When boredom crept in and we knew we were about to get nailed with a large order we'd work ahead and get as many done as we could before the next round of orders came in. Expedite the process a little.

One guitar in particular I thought was TOTALLY screwed. I pulled it out of the box and could see the upbow. The relief measured more than a quarter of an inch. That's RELIEF, not action. For some reason the truss rod had never been tightened! It was flopping around completely loose. After conferring with those much more skilled than I was we determined the best course of action was going to be CRANK THE FUCKER! I put a full turn on the bastard and... get this... the neck straightened out PERFECTLY. Beyond perfect. As in the best playing guitar I've ever had my hands on. The action measured about 1mm all across the 12th fret (we're talking Charvels here), with ZERO buzzing. It was a thing of beauty. I wrapped the thing back up, boxed it, and sent it back out to the warehouse.

This was in June. One thing lead to another and that guitar ended up not shipping for a while.

Fast forward to September. 

We finally get an order for that particular model. I knew which one I was pulling because I'd been contemplating buying it ever since (I kick myself for not doing so). Open up the box, expecting the worst. I figure by now it's been through Texas warehouse heat all through summer. The neck's going to be all kinds of fucked and warped and toast, right? The action measured about 1mm all across the 12th fret, with ZERO buzzing. It was a thing of beauty. Still.

The moral of the story is: Sometimes anecdotes are bullshit. The above story, however, is true. But you shouldn't think your guitar will act the same way. Then again there's no reason to think it won't.

The moral of the moral is: Your guitar is a living thing. It breathes. It moves. It wants to do what it wants to do. No matter how many times you measure or quantify, it's still an ornery piece of wood that doesn't want to do what you tell it. Don't treat every guitar like every other guitar. Listen to what it's telling you. Feel how subtle differences can effect tone and playability. Throw the fucking repair manual out of the window and just go by the seat of your pants.

Just don't break anything.

Got a can, sprayed a quick squirt in the pots, selector switch and jack and the noise is gone.  Even better, my guitar sounds noticeably better!  The sound is just fuller, kind of hard to describe.

Two local (Portland) guitarists have had gear stolen from their vehicles in the past month.

Both vehicles were the only ones broken into in their respective neighborhoods.  
Both guys feel they were likely targeted, as details lead them to believe it wasn't random.

Anyway, this is just a reminder to make the extra trip or two and get your stuff inside.
As much as it sucks hauling gear up apartment stairs at 2:00am where you're tired and you've been driving for hours to get home, losing over a grand in gear sucks more.

Be careful out there guys!

The insights into amp design are really fascinating even if you don't have an understanding of electronics. Just the history of amplification is worth a read.

There are sections on valve (tube) versus solid-state from a design perspective that should provide some good food for thought no matter what your thoughts on one or the other are.

I had an '88 Les Paul Standard Tobacco Burst that I played for nearly 11 years and eventually sold to an orderly working at our hospital. I regretted the decision soon after, and had no way of contacting the guy later to see if he wanted to sell it back. 

Well, fast forward 13 years. I have a ""Welcome Meeting"" with a new physician that joining the staff at our hospital. As I'm sitting there talking to him I'm thinking ""Damn, he looks familiar."" Well when it's just me and him, he looks at me and says ""you still playing guitar?"". Then it hits me, it's that orderly I sold my guitar to in '98. He's now a doctor. 

After shooting the shit, I ask him, ""you still have that Les Paul I sold you?"". Not only does he still have it, he wants to sell it back. Says it collected dust after he went to Med School. 

I finally got my hands back on it two weeks ago. My ole' '88 that's been gone for over 13 years. And holy shit I forgot how good she felt. I almost teared up when I took it out of the case tonight. The first thing I saw was a big ding on the top rear of the guitar and instantly remembered back in '92 dropping it at a gig and putting it there. The memories tied to this guitar are more than I can list. She's finally back!

I've owned a few Les Pauls over the years, but none that had the sound or playability of that '88. My PRS's are about to gather some dust!

1344782294.0,239,self.Guitar,y3e7a,"""Guitarist"" vs. ""Non-Guitarist"" Music",,298,59,232,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/y3e7a/guitarist_vs_nonguitarist_music/,"[This post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/y1xq8/why_do_so_many_people_dislike_slash/c5rnc0s) from the ""Why Do People Dislike Slash"" thread got me thinking about the whole phenomenon of the taste of guitar players vs. non-guitar players.

I'm not particularly interested in Slash; I give [my own reason](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/y1xq8/why_do_so_many_people_dislike_slash/c5ryfwq) in that thread why I don't care for his music.

But I found it interesting, this perspective -- which one encounters occasionally in guitar playing circles -- on the perception of guitar players among general music listeners and actual guitar players.  A subtext of these kind of discussions is that general music listeners lack the discernment to appreciate a Steve Vai or Buckhethead over somebody like Slash.

I'm cautious of overgeneralizing on either side, but I'll lay my cards on the table and say that for the most part, I actually don't like music that is listened to solely by guitar players, whether that be high-shredding guitar heroics or cliche white-guy-blues.  (Classical and Jazz sometimes have the reputations of being ""musician's music"", but those are genres with considerable general audiences, arguably broader than just musicians; I love those genres fwiw).  

When most of us picked up the guitar, we were probably inspired by music that wasn't ""guitarist"" music, but rather music that was made to appeal to a general musical audience (and I mean general in an inclusive way here; not just passive radio listeners but also obsessive record collecting connoisseurs).  In terms of music where guitars play a central role, I'd rather listen to Captain Beefheart or The Kinks or Joy Division or Sonic Youth (who I don't even like that much) over any of the stuff that is promoted in guitar magazines.  The appeal of the former is that while the guitar as an instrument is central to the sound, it's not music made to showcase the guitar.  It's music intended to convey some kind of artistic vision beyond mere instrumental mastery.

Do others on this sub-reddit feel the same way?  I feel like music that is targeted to guitar players is inherently limited in a creative sense; and I don't mean because it emphasizes technical virtuosity; but rather because the music seems focused upon showcasing the guitar to the exclusion of serving any other function.  In terms of taste (which admittedly is entirely, 100% subjective), I'd rather rely upon a non-musician critic like Lester Bangs or Simon Reynolds than most of the people who write for guitar magazines.

I should note that I'm not dissing instrumental prowess; I think instrumental prowess should be something to strive for.  What I am saying is that such prowess should be subordinated to an overarching artistic vision; a perfect example of what I'm talking about is Steve Vai's work on the Public Image Limited album ""Album"".  That contains my favorite playing by Vai, due probably in part that it's not music to showcase Vai's excellent guitar skills; rather, Vai's excellent guitar skills are merely put at the service of realizing John Lydon's artistic vision.

Does anyone else feel the same way?  Anyone prefer ""Non-Guitarist"" guitar music over ""Guitarist"" guitar music?

I'm talking about that pleasant feeling on the back of your neck, head, or spine. Music, to me, is just as much a drug as sex, food, or pharmaceuticals. ",moonlapse,311,76,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/12oco5/guitar_music_and_asmr_do_you_ever_feel_shivers/,"Hello fellow shredders! I really hope to have a long conversation with you guys. I don't really know how to start the conversation I want to have, so I will simply ask if anyone else feels ""Stimulated"" when listening to or playing music.


I'll explain what I mean by ""Stimulation"" a little: I, quite frequently, feel ""Tingles"" along the back of my head, neck, and all the way down my spine. It is very similar to what I feel after a good stretch, post-orgasm, after eating good meal, or the ""Euphoria"" I feel while on the come up of LSD, or while on nitrous oxide (there are a billion different things that make me feel it, these are just the most common).


I have come to know these tingles as ""ASMR"" (which may or may not be correct). This might not be the correct, but I cannot find any other means to describe the sensation. I think that the ""ASMR Community"" as seen on /r/asmr is in it's infancy and is not yet ready to discuss this topic on the level I want to. That's why I'm coming to /r/guitar.


These ""ASMR"" responses are incredibly common when I am listening to really complex or interesting music or, most especially, when I am PLAYING complex music (especially when in-time with metronome, drums, etc.). I theorize that some of you guys have felt this, because musicians tend to be smart and observant people. 



Here are some questions that I would ask any that are interested in this phenomena to answer:


**1) What drugs have you taken in the past? I ask because I think that most of the people that experience this are predisposed to altering their mind and body. Also, it gives important context for explaining some of the stimulus that is derived from these experiences.**


**2) Do you think about your own consciousness and mental health in non-westernized fashion (Meditation, Drug use, Exercise, spirituality, etc.)?**


**3) Are you interested in brain chemistry and pharmacology? Are you interested in the science of your emotions, thoughts, etc?**


**4) Have you always felt ""Stimulation"" from music or guitar?**


**5) When was the first time you remember feeling stimulated in this way? When was the last time?**


**6) Do you or are you interested in seeking out this feeling? Have you experienced it in non-musical context?**


**7) This whole subject is scorned by popular science and probably society as a whole. What is needed to legitimize the study of this field? Have you ever discussed this with anyone else before?**


**8) The final and most important question: What triggers these feelings, for you. What are your thoughts on this phenomena? What do you hope to learn about this topic?**


I'm really hoping to find some other psychonauts or guitar shamans. This topic is one of the most interesting things in my life, and I desperately crave conversation with like-minded people.

Like if you told me to play guitar right now, I almost always make stuff up on the spot. Now a good way to getting used to improvising, is doing it! But certain approaches can help you form your ideas faster and come up with more ""substance"".

(edit): see i used to make stuff up in-between my technical practice and had a lot of ideas. but i wouldn't play more than 10 minutes at a time until before i would go to the next exercise. this is different by forcing you to play more than you may want to hear yourself play (at first). instead of when you dont like your playing you stop, this makes you keep going. its like a secret level in mario. you could get the flag right in front of you, or you could jump over onto some blocks, run past the flag, and access new worlds.

Here is the way i do it (atleast did it for a while):

Step 1: get your guitar

Step 2: get a metronome (optional but helps to have a balance between using one and not)

Step 3: Set up a timer for an hour and make sure you have no       knowledge of how much time you have left. 

Step 4: Play things that aren't pre-written. Just mess around..

Step 5: If youre playing electric, try playing without effects or on only one channel. The minimal set up can promote creativity.

You'll find yourself wanting to quit, hating your ideas, turning your session into abstract distorted noise for a long period of time (nothing wrong with that :p ) because this may be the first way you ever express yourself through the instrument even if it comes out distorted and ""non-musical"". you dont want to play guitar, but youre forced to, so you put little effort into coordinating your fingers or paying attention to what stings you hit, because you dont want to play and youre EXPRESSING that.

 But this REALLY helps with coming up with stuff in the long run and really unifying your ""spirit"" with your guitar. where eventually you may not need to think to like what YOU'RE playing. This may help with playing how you ""feel"". (Keep in mind just because your playing may not sound radio-friendly doesnt mean it's not something youre extracting from your ""spirit"". Because as we all know, emotions are complex.) Now im not saying you have to play guitar to express yourself, it's just one of the many things we may think comes out of our instruments along with noise and may want to promote ""expression"".
 
Try to not keep yourself inside a scale or in the 7 ""right"" notes for the whole time. Experiment. You'll do more things differently the more you open yourself up and the more you play. It's another method to keep yourself from getting into a rut. The more you play, the more you notice yourself doing the same things. Eventually you may want to play other things.. It's a little negative, but you may find yourself sick of the same riffs you play and playing other things may keep things interesting. The only difference is, you push on and past that state of mind, instead of putting the guitar down.

You see a lot of guitarists who make you go, ""wow, they play really well, i wanna play well!"". Well you don't see all of those people only practicing technical things. they play, and a lot of them are like you who may have never forced themselves to play for an hour straight, but just had the luxury of playing with others and being able to form a band and being forced in another way to play guitar that makes you think or at least amplify YOU. So they sound ""good"" because they've had a lot of trial and error making things up as they go, it just seems like something in the background because to a lot of us, it may be more fun to play with other musicians not even really getting specific about ""what"" we play.

This is a guy who encompasses what i want to make a reality to a musician's playing and having them feel like they're thinking on their feet as much as this guy can (in my humble opinion):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YAsue-KM0o  (start around 2:50)

[IMPORTANT] Doing this ""practice"" helps with developing your ""real"" side of your guitar playing and over a week/month doing this daily may skyrocket your playing (i think it did for me). For you aren't really thinking when you're doing technique based exercises and i say ""real"" because improvising would be something you'd do if you were jamming with other musicians. 

It's funny how we practice things we hardly ever do when actually trying to play our instruments in a musical atmosphere and this (hopefully) addresses the things youre not happy with when you go in and jam with someone else that no amount of technique practice could fix nearly as fast as something like this (in my opinion)

You can also use this method when trying to accomplish other goals. A handful could be:

-Playing an hour straight with no pick, only finger picking, tapping, and whatever else you can do with your hand to promote noise. (getting your tapping more accurate/finger style more controllable)

-Play an hour straight not minding what notes you hit, getting the imaginary grid scale that cover our guitars out of the way for a bit.

-Only being able to play chords. Helps with, you know, CHORDS! you may be slow at first, but generally, playing for an hour straight helps you keep up with yourself and transitioning to the next idea you want to execute in general. practicing chords is another area where you may want something to ""go-to"" in your playing.

What doing this exercise did for me:

-Made me eventually dislike technical practice (even though i still do it to keep being able to do what i want to do on the guitar) and i can sit down and just play for 45 minutes without any motivation to help my playing, but for the sole sake of wanting to play guitar.

-Allows me to do things i want to do at a faster pace with less thinking. (I hope we all strive for this part of our playing to be like speaking in our native tongues)

-Being able to just keep up with a drummer and making the guitar do things i want to be done on it.

-Helping me know what notes sound like before i hit them. No i dont practice reading music or learing names of notes. The countless times you just play on the guitar and look at where your fingers are (in my opinion) is the best way to connect with the guitar like a language. its like what victor wooten says, we (as in some of us) learn music backwards.. where we learn to read before we talk. We learn how to communicate in our first language by being around those who speak it and through trial and error, making things almost effortless when trying to communicate or just express something. 

Whether you read my big run-on sentenced blob of mind vomit or not, i hope this helps if you find yourself ""stuck"".

Also, if you remember after a couple of days of trying this, it would amazing to get some feedback on how this helped/changed anything in your playing :D",,False,,t5_2qi79,1356992386.0,,,True,t3_15p69y,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/15p69y/i_have_some_advice_to_help_you_get_out_your_ruts/,

 Generally, the heart-felt thank yous and nice messages make it worth it.

So I've been playing guitar for about 9 years and I'm very embarrassed to admit that I never really got down to actually learning my scales fully. Got as far as a few *patterns* though, but never got the full neck. Now a couple of months ago I set about learning an entire scale every day. And wow... I feel like I've come out of the dark swamp and entered the world of light. I think a lot of people underestimate how knowing the neck of your guitar will free the musician inside of you. 

I know a lot of people who are a bit lazy with their theory practice and only focus on learning songs and really grope in the dark a bit when trying to improvise or go off from knowing one or two patterns (I was one of those people for years) I would just like to really press how absolutely crucial knowledge of your scales is to becoming a better musician.

1364479573.0,218,self.Guitar,1b6dq0,One of the most important things ANY Acoustic guitarist should own.,thesleepsessions,288,70,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1b6dq0/one_of_the_most_important_things_any_acoustic/,"Is [this: http://imgur.com/XLQQHAQ](http://imgur.com/XLQQHAQ), a simple, £2 stressball.

I've been playing for nearly 15 years now, and spent a very long time playing purely electric, powerchords only, and no little finger use.

I've progressed onto the acoustic over the last couple of years, and I've always struggled with barring chords, little finger strength and my thumb; in the sense that my little finger rarely lasts more than 30 or 40 minutes before I can even put any pressure on the fretboard any more, and the fleshy bit under my thumb cramps up like a bitch.

For some reason, I hit a wall, even practicing for hours daily my sound would deteriorate and I'd be in excruciating pain, until it was suggested by my girlfriend, a holistic therapist, that I get a stressball.

I've been using it daily, whilst at work, just squeezing away, rolling it around my hand, inbetween my fingers etc.

In just under a week I can play for longer, my finger strength has gone through the roof, my little finger is getting better and better, and the cramps I get in my thumb are as good as gone.

Seriously, anyone who is struggling with playing for long periods of time, or has a particularly weak finger, get yourself on eBay or something similar, and grab a pack of these things; it'll change your life :)

EDIT: For those who're confused - I don't JUST do powerchords, and haven't for many years, **[THIS - https://soundcloud.com/isaacbirchall/sets/the-sleep-sessions](https://soundcloud.com/isaacbirchall/sets/the-sleep-sessions)** is what I do these days. :)",,False,,t5_2qi79,1364484390.0,,,True,t3_1b6dq0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1b6dq0/one_of_the_most_important_things_any_acoustic/,

I've had a cool idea using the newly released Instagram video. Basically, I've created an Instagram and Twitter account to try and promote the #Instariff hashtag. 

The idea is that guitarists uploading themselves playing using Instagram video can all use the #Instariff tag as a way of being found by others in order to get feedback, comments, tips, likes etc. I'm currently running the @Instariffs account on Instagram which already has 100 followers, and the hashtag has over 100 uploads in just a few days. The twitter account will eventually start running 'riff of the week' shoutouts etc. once it has enough followers and contributors. So far, it would appear the idea has potential.

Instagram video is limited to 15 seconds, and often with the tightest of boundaries we are forced to be more creative in order to stand out. I think this is a really good idea to bring guitarists together and show other players our favourite riffs and melodies.

I'd like your opinions on the set up so far, and how we can reach out to guitarists on Instagram and encourage them to show us their skills...

Also, if anyone is interested:

If his lyrics are humorous then I guess that makes more sense... if not then I don't know. The weird voices and strange lyrics don't help either. What is it that I'm missing?

Sorry if this came off as a rant, I'm honestly not trying to bash the guy, just trying to understand what makes him great. I feel like I'm missing out on something awesome by not understanding his music

Edit/Update: From what I've gathered, Zappa's music is a lot like Radiohead's in that it is complex, unusual and sometimes off-putting and intentionally abrasive that somehow comes off as stunningly beautiful to certain people.

My question though, is why? What did he do that is considered so mind blowing? 

I have listened to plenty of his material and -remembering that music taste is subjective- I do not enjoy it at all. Clearly he is considered one of the best guitarists of all time but can anyone explain to me exactly why? All I can find in a Google search are people saying he did things no-one else had done, invented a new sound etc etc, but I can't find anything that explains this in more detail. What exactly did he do that no-one else had done? What sound did he invent?

Did he really do anything that any one else playing around with a guitar wouldn't have figured out themselves? 

Is there proof that Hendrix invented any sounds or techniques and no-one else was doing the same thing already? Is there proof he wasn't just a commercial success?

I'm not here to question the authenticity of his reputation, I'm here to be convinced that it is justified.






Edit: Well thanks to everyone who had constructive input here. I understand a little more about the reasons Hendrix is worshiped so, though I still do not appreciate his music the way people here do, nor will I ever. 

What I have noticed however, is that I have been asking rational, objective questions about why people like Hendrix, and all those questions have been downvoted to hell, yet emotional, non-constructive ramblings about how amazing he is get upvoted. This basically confirms a lot of what I already suspected. It's O.K. to ask yourself why you like something or someone, you know. It's called critical thinking, try it sometime.

He said ""I've made the most popular guitars in the world now I am going to make the best.""  And he was NOT lying!",nanuku,331,119,371,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/15yxze/if_you_like_stratsteles_in_the_slightest_then_i/,"Upvote this, not for me but for all the people that either never heard of this fine company or just haven't had a chance to check them out.
   I was making a comment in a thread and decided that this company deserves some exposure.  I am a huge gear-head and really look for great quality combined with good prices.  And G&amp;L seriously delivers in both areas: 

A little story illustrating G&amp;L's fine quality build:  My brother used to play the thickest strings he could find.  I know he played 14s for a long time and I think he even got up to 16s for at least a little while.  And he didn't like to tune down.  He liked those bridge cables at standard tuning!  Well, needless to say he folded a few guitars just from the stress on the neck.  We soon found that the only guitars that could hold the pressure were Fenders.  Then my black Fender folded and we thought that he was going to have to thin his strings down, compromise his sound.  I seriously did not want that to happen.  He had one of the freshest, most commanding sounds I had ever heard.  So I started doing some research.  I was recommended to try G&amp;L.  The proponnent said they were probably ""the toughest damn guitars you'll find out there""  Needless to say the ONLY guitars that could take 16 guage strings day in and day out and just shrug it off like it was nothing.  I'm telling you, you may never need that type of strength from a guitar but I was seriously impressed and with the fit and finish, play-ability and tremendous sound these guitars produce, they are one of a kind in my book.  I feel like I got a deeper perspective due to my and my brothers relationship with them.  He only plays G&amp;L and they made it so that he never had to compromise his very unique sound.

""If you are into strats or teles, I would like to very strongly recommend checking out a used, American made, G&amp;L.  Not sure if you've heard of them, they slip by alot of people.  Basically after Leo Fender was told he had like 6 months to live , he sold Fender guitars.  Then he went to work at Ernie Ball Musicman, making some of their best/most iconic guitars and some of their best pickups.  Well he wasn't dieing so he opened up his own guitar company and in his own words he said ""I made the most famous guitar in the world- now I am going to make the best guitar in the world""  If Leo's saying that-I am most definitely listening.  I couldn't agree with him more-I think he really did make his best guitars with that company and that's saying alot because I love his guitars.  The G&amp;Ls are like fenders made with the precision of Gibson custom shop.   Every (US made) G&amp;L I've ever played blew me away! I still haven't found one that I didn't find amazing.  When he was still there, they even had a line of student guitars that were better than most custom shops products.  They were and are the epitome of class when it comes to strat and tele type guitars I don't think you can do any better no matter were and how hard you look.  Basically a used $500 G&amp;L will give you the vibe and quality of a $1000-2000 Fender custom shop job.""

Plus they have some of the most unique pickups that I've seen.  Fender considered them to be such a departure from regular pickups that he wouldn't even call them pickups, he instead called them ""Near-feild coils"" or something like that.
I mean for a good example is the Z-coils, [check these bad boys out.](http://www.glguitars.com/shopping/shopexd.asp?id=234)  He was completely reworking the standard idea for pickups (this is what he was working on when he died, if I remember correctly)  This just shows how much he thought outside the box (then he would redesign the box while he was at it)  When I started to read about him, the more I found out, the more impressed I was with his engineering prowess and his creative talent.  If he hadn't been told he was going to die soon, he probably never would have sold Fender to CBS and I think the guitars quality would have stayed very high and we would have a different yet much better ""Fender"" these days.  However, I also think selling Fender is what made him change is approach with G&amp;L and quality probably wouldn't have been so high on his list of features for his new company.

The first guitar I ever built was stolen from the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco this last week.  I built it over 6 months in '94 and it has huge sentimental value to me.  It is essentially a copy of a Matin OM style guitar and it has an ""LF"" inlay in the headstock.  There is a ton of wear and scratches on the top from 9 plus years of playing. If any of y'all have seen it I would love some help.  Thanks so much guys!!

* The guy that shapes the headstocks does it all by hand on a belt sander. He doesn't use a jig or a guide, does it all by eye and has a 1/16 inch error rate. (I was impressed by this)  

* The guys at the end of the assembly line that install the electronics and strings are the only ones that are actually required to be able to play guitar. They have to demonstrate their playing and knowledge before they can get that job.  

* All of the painting is done by a guy with a hand sprayer like you'd see in an auto body shop. They do this instead of automated painting so no two of their guitars will have the exact same paint job.   

* According to the tour guide, the factory doesn't use any computer system to track any of the wood or progress of guitars through the line. Before painting, all the information on the guitar is wrote in pencil on the body. After painting, it's wrote on masking tape that was put on the fret board to keep paint off.

When you heat milk and add vinegar you end up with a kind of plastic made from chains of casein from the milk.

I decided to try to make picks, I found that they have to be thick though, or they break easily. I also managed to refine the recipe slightly.

Here's a clip of me using one:
http://youtu.be/Ud-3-txmglY

And a closeup of the pick:
http://i.imgur.com/hOaW2Fo.jpg


So, here's how you can do it too and make any shape pick you want. This will give you enough for 4-5 thick picks, the recipe can be multiplied.

What you need:
Milk (skimmed is best)
White vinegar.
Baking soda.
A sieve.
Paper towels.
Foil or baking paper sheets.
Something flat and heavy (cook book, box...)


First mix milk into a teaspoon or two of baking soda and make a paste.

Then add two cups of milk, stir this very thoroughly.

For heating in the microwave I found 1:30 @ 1000w works well. In a pan, just make sure the milk gets hot without boiling.

Once hot, add 2 tablespoons of vinegar and stir thoroughly. Solids will form.

Place paper towels in a sieve and pour the mixture though, press it to get as much moisture out as you can.

It's quite hard to work with because it is crumbly like a strange cottage cheese but work it into a ball, smooth it out flat to the thickness you desire on a sheet of foil or baking paper (a little thicker than what you want the pick to be) and let it dry for 30 mins to an hour.

Lay a template of the pick shape you want over the plastic and cut around it, repeat as many times as will fit - discard the excess if it is too hard to reroll.

Be careful (as the picks are delicate) and add another sheet of foil on top. Then place the flat heavy object on them. This prevents curling while they dry.

Leave them for 48-72 hours in a warm dry place.

Sand them roughly to clean them up and sharpen/smooth the point on some carpet.

See, I can remember a given mode, but then I don't know what to 'do' with it. Like, ok, great here is this pattern, but how do I turn that into a riff or a song? I can do so much with the blues minor, but I dont know how to use that same proficiency with anything else. 

I really want to get into making drone music, but I just don't want to be stuck with blues minor. Blues minor. Blues minor! I'm sick of the blues minor.

Am I just retarded? Maybe there is some amazing guide to music theory that I've never seen before that you may know about? I can't be the only player that's stuck like this?

Gibson Les Paul has been my main guitar for many years, but yet I longed for something different and I've been in love with Tele shape lately, so I decided to sort of blend those two together and address a few issues that bothered me in stock models.



Specs are as follows:


* Alder body with tummy cut, arm rest, and Tele Deluxe routing
* All-ebony neck
* DiMarzio D-Activator pickups with classic Les Paul wiring
* Strat flat mount bridge (strings through body)
* 500k pots
* Schaller locking tuners and strap locks


It's just a tiny bit neck-heavy (not nearly as much as an SG though) but still plays like a dream! Sounds exactly how I intended it to be. Pickups are pretty much how DiMarzio advertises them...

1369950478.0,196,self.Guitar,1fd4cl,Sweep Picking - Fundamentals of Technique (x-post r/metalguitar,SeraphSlaughter,234,38,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1fd4cl/sweep_picking_fundamentals_of_technique_xpost/,"Hey r/guitar, I wrote this lesson up for r/metalguitar and I think some of you who aren't metal players may still be interested in this technique. Hell, Chet Atkins was doing it in his style too, I'm sure a bunch of you have heard his amazing talent. I'll be splitting this into two parts - Technique and Theory. Today, we'll be focusing purely on technique, so don't worry about what you're playing musically in the examples I give you just yet. I want you to focus on the physical aspect -- what's going on with your hands.

So, let's get to it! First, we have to examine what's going on with each hand.

**The Right Hand**

The name of the technique has ""picking"" right in the title, so let's go right where the action is. In broad terms, sweep picking sounds mostly self-explanatory: instead of alternate picking when we shift strings, we simply continue in the direction we were picking on the previous string. This allows us to execute some interesting patterns when we glide across the strings quickly. It's not quite strumming a chord, since, in that case, the aim there is to get all of the notes out ""simultaneously"" (or, rather, as close as the strumming motion will allow); with sweeping, we want to articulate each note clearly before we get to the next one. The right hand's job seems easy here. Where people get tripped up is turning the sweep around in the other direction. We'll cover how to get more comfortable with this with a few examples momentarily, because how to do this is contextual to what sort of sweep shape you're playing

**The Left Hand**

Obviously, it's the left hand's job to fret the notes - but that's not all. A lot of players starting with sweeps can't seem to get it to sound ""clean"", and will tend to tighten up on the right hand in order to try and get the sound cleaner, but it won't help. Why not? Think about how you keep extra strings ringing out when you're playing plain chords on your guitar - if you're strumming away, you can't lock your right hand down to mute the unneeded strings, so what do you do? You rely on your left hand to mute the other strings of course! By gently resting parts of your fingers against strings you don't need, you deaden them. In sweeping, it is the same: it is generally the LEFT hand that is keeping the sound ""clean"". The key is getting the sync down.


**The Sync**

Let's start putting this together with an example:

    l----------9-----------l
    l-----10-----10--------l
    l-11-------------11----l
    l----------------------l
    l----------------------l
    l----------------------l

Here's a basic starter shape. You'll want to use your 3rd (ring) finger to hit the 11th fret on the G, your 2nd (middle) finger to hit the 10 on the B, and your 1st (pointer) finger to hit the 9 on the E. Set a metronome at a slow tempo, and play this as eighth notes - two notes per click of the metronome. Let's start sweepin'.

What you're going to do is, pick each note at the same time as your fret it with your left hand. Hold the note for as long as you're supposed to (eighth notes, here!), and just as your pick is about to hit the next note, lift up the finger that was fretting the previous note enough to get the note to stop ringing and mute it - you may also use the tip of the finger that is about to fret the next note to deaden the string you have just fretted further. The finger that frets the next note will usually also help to deaden the previous string - again, this depends on the shape.

Ok, this seems all well and good til we hit that last note, it's a sweep pick so just carry the down pick through that third note, the 9 on the E, right? NOPE! Think about it -- if we carry the sweep and continue to pick down, when we have to up-pick the 10 on the B again, we have to lift our pick back up over the E! This flies in the face of the economy of motion sweep picking is all about - so, if we have something like this, and immediate shift in direction, you're gonna want to set up the shift in direction on the last note - so, in this case, our right hand would pick DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, UP to play that sweep. If we don't stop the sweep down at the 11 on G again, we're gonna want to set up the change in direction again. So, just before you hit that note on the G string, start picking down again. If we played the lick twice through, the pattern would read DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, UP. Get it? Let's try something new.


    l---------9-10p9------l
    l-----10--------10----l
    l-11---------------11-l
    l---------------------l
    l---------------------l
    l---------------------l

Play this one as triplets, or three notes to each click of the metronome. Slow it down a bit from the last example if you have to. Remember, GETTING THE SYNC DOWN COUNTS MORE THAN SPEED!!! In THIS situation, we have to pick the E string twice. Therefore, we actually will carry the motion of the sweep down through the E string, but since we are immediately shifting direction at the G string again, we do have to set that up - resulting in a pattern of DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, UP, UP, etc if you sweep endlessly on this shape. You'll want to practice both switching direction immediately, and having to pick the string twice for another note on both ends of the sweep: add in some hammered/pulled off notes of your own on that G string to get that down. Don't worry about note choice yet, we're talking about technique for now.

Ok, that's the basics. Now start applying these to a few other shapes so your fingers don't get used to only one kind of sweep: 

    l--------------9------------l----------------10------------l
    l---------10-----10--------l-----------10-------10---------l
    l-----11-------------11----l-------11---------------11-----l
    l-12--------------------12-l--12------------------------12-l
    l--------------------------l-------------------------------l
    l--------------------------l-------------------------------l

Here's two four string sweeps to add a little extra. Again, play as triplets - three notes to a click. Don't play them one after the other just yet. On the second one, you're going to want to play both of those 10th fret notes with your first finger. Learning how to roll your finger is one of the tougher parts of sweep picking - apply the same ideas about fretting the note/deadening previous notes, but using just one finger! Add some hammered/pulled off notes at the top and bottom of these sweeps to get used to both styles of sweep-direction changes. Again, just use a comfortable one for now - worry about theory later.

Here's a final shape that's a killer. It's a 5 stringer, but you can turn the sweep around at the G or D strings too just fine - in fact the three string version of this is one of my favorites:

    l---------------------10h14p10-----------------l
    l-----------------12-------------12------------l
    l-------------11---------------------11--------l
    l--------12-----------------------------12-----l
    l--9h14------------------------------------14--l
    l----------------------------------------------l

Remember - be conscious of how you're transferring each time you change direction. Start slow, and focus on fretting/muting with your left hand and proper pick direction in your right. The SYNC is more important than speed!! You actually don't have to sweep too fast to sound impressive.

That's the technique lesson. Next time, a theory lesson on how to construct sweep patterns, embellish them, and where/how to use them in a song. Learning this technique takes time, don't feel like you can tear through this lesson in a day. In actual lessons, I would be stopping you and commenting on your playing, but I do not have the luxury of doing that via text. Feel free to ask questions in the comments, or let me know if something wasn't clear/you could use another example.

* [Right hand tecnique and voicings lesson](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAUVLmepNbI). To further study the rythmic feel of Manouche Jazz.

If you have any problems reading the charts or getting started, feel free to message me. I'm by all concepts a novice but I can offer a helping hand where I can. Swing on!

I made this image today as I had a breakthrough on my own when I discovered that *every* major and minor scale uses **the exact same pattern.**

Take a look at the portion in the top right to see what I mean.

I think I'll be making a Minor scale chart with all the minor scale roots soon. If anyone is interested in that, I will update this post with it.

Hopefully this will help someone as much as it helped me.

EDIT 3:

From user /u/GrantSolar

I don't think the formatting is going to work as good on here. Check this link for his post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1ccn0y/for_beginners_to_fretboard_logic_major_and_minor/c9foxdo Again, the only thing to remember is that, when actually playing this pattern on the fretboard, you will need to shift up a fret when moving from the G string to the B string, and the opposite (move down one fret) when moving from the B string to the G string.

Fun fact: The reason that you must shift any pattern - pentatonic, major/minor scale, etc. - when moving between the G and B strings is because every other open string combo ( E to A, A to D, D to G, and B to E) has two whole notes between the open string notes, where as between G and B, there is only one note: A.

EDIT 4: The original copy+paste of /u/GrantSolar post sucked, haha. I linked his comment above. Also, as I noted in another reply down below, when I get home this evening I will record myself going over this pattern on the fretboard and show you exactly what I mean by only needing the one pattern. I promise it is worth knowing once the concept is grasped. I suck at tutorials. :/

The best guitar teacher I had gave me a chart like this one.
I lost it recently and so I made one myself and included key signatures.

For beginners, each triad is constructed in its Key by skipping every other note, starting on its respective Root, left to right 3 times.

The roman numerals at the top indicate which degree of the scale is represented by which column.

 Also, notice how they are all sorted by 5th and the key signature is in respect to that. 

Bonus memorize the circle of 5ths

Note: This chart neglects Enharmonic keys and isn't completely proper in respect to those considerations.

Voila!

Took a friend's kid to a guitar store for the first time.  He had an incredible time playing a few different guitars and then the drums.

**Long version:**

My friend's son has been wanting to show me his guitar for awhile now.  When my wife and I came over to their place this weekend for a barbeque, he eagerly ran up to his room and brought down a (somewhat cheap) parlor guitar.  

I tried tuning the guitar, but the strings were ancient and two of them snapped.  Well, I'll take any excuse to head to the local guitar store... so I took him to guitar center to ""get some new strings"".

The kid likes music.  He's got an electric keyboard, his parlor guitar and at his father's place he's got an electric guitar as well.. but he'd never been to a guitar store before.  He was blown away that you could take a guitar off the wall and make terrible noise with it on the various amps they had.  

Because he's ten and just starting to play guitar, my rudimentary skills make me look like a virtuoso in his eyes. 

He was wailing on a Strat for about twenty minutes when he paused, looked up, and asked (holding back the flood of hope in his voice as much as could) ""Do they have drums here, too?""


And so, after requesting a pair of sticks and adjusting a throne to his small stature, he made an impressive racket on one of the drum sets.

This was ridiculously fun.  It makes me look forward to having kids.


**Epilogue:**

We got back to my friend's house and I threw the new strings on his guitar, but the cheap thing has such terrible intonation (and no way to change it at the bridge) that it's almost completely useless as an instrument.  I'm going to just give the kid my cheap old Squier acoustic... at least he'll be able to make some decent sounds with it.  Plus, it's gathering dust in my guest bedroom right now.

Yes, the questions probably could have been better worded and yes, there could have been some more questions, but here are the results

There were 1131 total responses, so ~1/60th of the people subscribed to /r/Guitar responded

Type of guitar - dominated by electric, most popular type were strat types - I meant for the question to be type, not specific brand, which quite a few people misunderstood - my mistake, question wasn't worded that clearly.  Other types were generally just specific brands, although [a few were insteresting](http://i.imgur.com/QTjSMDt.png)

[Type of guitar](http://i.imgur.com/8LnpACK.png)

Type of music - not surprisingly, rock/metal/blues [dominated](http://i.imgur.com/evVNXCv.png) - I was a bit surprised that 17% of the respondents play classical, I would never have guessed it' be that high

By far the most interesting part of the survey were the responses to 'What genre/sub-genre would you say your primary music type is' - some of the more interesting types:

* ??  
* 6 string Wankery  
* Adult Contemporary Progressive Death Metal  
* Alternative with too may arpeggios  
* arty post-proto-indie doompop jazzcore with hints of gypsy techno-pop  
* Beatles and Pixies had a child given up for adoption and raised by Frank Zappa  
* Classical-metal-bluesasauras rex  
* corpse-grinding-doom-polka (the respondent also listed their guitar as pointy, which is only appropriate)  
* experimental noise (I think this is how my neighbors would describe my playing)  
* fuck if I know  
* I hate it, but ""indie rock""  
* Jack White sucks.  
* lazy electro dub rock (apparently either someone took the survey twice or two people play this)  
* melodic anthemic oi punk?  
* norweigan-black-doomgaze  (someone may have copied from the quiz)  
* Orgasmicly awesome tele driven sex  
* Pink Floyd Ennio Morricone Pat Metheny and Metallica go to the Soup Kitchen for Empenadas  
* pre-post ; you won't understand bro  
* Prozac bulldozer  
* Psh. I trancsend genres, man.  
* Swedish-grey-fearstare  
* vegetarian progressive grindcore  

I was going to try and do some correlations of guitar type to music type and maybe some others, but google spreadsheets seems not-quite-up-to-the-task, and I don't have excel on my PC

If anyone would like to take a closer look at the raw data, it's available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AulS-ZdHd4-8dGEwLUpaenZvZ3djdTRyNmE0b1dRTGc)

Would you be a buyer if I designed a strap button controlled B-Bender that would install with no body modification (using existing holes only) and sold it for $75?,scottiel,224,43,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/13to40/tele_players_of_rguitar_would_you_be_a_buyer_if_i/,"This is all just on paper for now but I'm fairly certain that I've worked out how to create a [strap button controlled B-Bender](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIilq3JdCT4) at a *much* lower cost and without all of the crazy routing.

It would run about $75-80 and would require absolutely no body modification as it would make use of existing holes on the guitar.

The cheapest benders currently on the market are around $180, require some drilling, and are lever actuated instead of strap button controlled.

I'm already in the business of selling cheap, mod-free ways to improve guitars, and I feel like this could be a great addition to my product line.

Anyway I'm thinking about putting together the first proof of concept and was wondering if this is something people would be interested in.

Let me know!

The bridge pickup still has that classic tele twang. I haven't had this kind of excitement when I opened the case everyday since Christmas as a child.

I was going through what was basically a personal
breakdown and I was to the point where I just didn't give a damn
about anything. One day I came across a Martin guitar in a case
and I just decided to take it. It was one of the stupidest things I
have ever done. When I came to the realization of what I did and
the possible consequences I was scared for weeks that I was going to get caught and lose my job and worse. But as time passed I realized
that I had got away with it. Over the years I have never since
taken anything from someone like that again and I have always
been ashamed so I never told anyone until now. I don't know who
it belonged to, but since I worked at the airline I know that they
received a claim and were reimbursed for the value of the guitar.
I used this to justify my actions to myself, but deep down I always
knew I did something really terrible.

I've been thinking about what I can do now to try to rectify this
in some way but I don't know how. I don't have any way to find
the owner and I thought about giving it away or selling it and
doing something good with the money, but I thought maybe it
is reported stolen (I checked the serial number with online
resources but found nothing reported). Anyway I am interested
in what you all think about this and if you have any ideas. Thanks
for listening.


**Edit:** Thanks for all the honest feedback. I know how fucked up a thing it was to do and what a douche, asshole, piece of subhuman shit I was (or am according to some). I don't have an excuse besides I was young and made a stupid selfish decision. Also as some say I am being selfish in not trying to go to every length possible such as turning myself in to try and find the rightful owner. That being said, I have responsibilities and commitments now that I'm not willing to jeopardize for this. It may be selfish, but that is just the truth.

I am going to take the advice of sending the guitar back to Martin and
seeing if they can contact the owner. It sounds like the guitar is likely to be registered there so there is a good chance. I am going to include a letter explaining what happened and that if they can't find the owner to try to find someone who deserves it. Just as a point of closure for all of you the guitar in question is a 1973 D-18.

It's like a transformation and unless you experience it, you'll never know how just good it clicks together.
The part in question is the Sweet Child solo, the alternate picking part if you know where that is.

This was the description:

_________


Up for Auction is a 2011 ?  Fender Strat.  Here is the Story.  My husband was an avid guitar player, it was  his hobby and love.  He had a 1990
Fender Custom Shop USA made Strat that  he loved.  He became ill and had a very time holding it, as it weighed 9.9 lbs. so he really couldn't play
it for more that 10 minutes and he had to stop.

So we went in search of a Luthier who could possibly build him a replica of it.   We finally found one in December of 2009.  In February after
time spent in the hospital, we travelled to where he lived and brought the original with  us.

He agreed that he could duplicate it exactly, but that it would weight much less.  So we commissioned him to build one for us, in May of 2011
it was done.

It body is  made of Alder, rosewood neck, locking nuts for strings. pick guard etc were purchased from Fender by us so that we could get
the exact match of the 1990.

When the Luthier was done, it played just as the original and looked exactly as the orginal. and the Weight was only 3lbs 4 ounces
basically a third of the original.

While traveling home from the Luthier's my husband became ill and I took him directly to the hospital.  

He passed and never got to play the guitar only for a few seconds when we picked it up.

Total price to have it custom built was $ 2290.00  

____________

I kind of feel bad for winning the guitar for only $500 bucks and change. 

But, I have never owned a near-mint guitar that was custom made for a dead man. 

This...will be interesting.

I have never taken any formal lessons, everything I've learned is from online tutorials and a few people giving me tips here and there, so hopefully these will help people in similar situations.  


**TIP #1: It's all patterns** -  This is painfully obvious to anyone who has looked at a chord chart, but when someone said these three words to me, it finally clicked.  I finally stopped thinking in terms of numbers and started thinking in terms of shapes and patterns.  After I had this planted in my head, it led to...


**TIP # 2: Everything's Relative** - Once I stopped thinking of progressions as G-D-C and started thinking of them as I-V-IV, it made it much easier to go on runs and throw in little fills, just knowing where the root note is.  Also, seeing the fretboard as 11 notes surrounding the root note (wherever it may be) made it seem like less of a puzzle and more like a repeating pattern to me (which goes back to tip #1).  


Like I said, I am by no means a model for how to properly learn how to play, but I'm assuming there are a lot of people who are self-taught and are just looking to get over the hump.  I know my playing has plateaued several times over the years, and since these two concepts got drilled into my head, I have been progressing pretty steadily ever since.  I just wish I had discovered them earlier.  These may seem totally obvious to many guitar players, but they weren't to me!

I first played this here Guitar in 1987, it belonged to a friend of a friend who soon became my jamming partner of 11 years.  I moved away for a while but we still sent tapes to each other, he would play a rhythm and I would put a lead melody to it.  He told me he bought it for $50 @ 1982 when he first joined the army.  I would visit him (I lived in LA and he lived in Sacramento, 6 hours away) and we would lock ourselves into his barn and literally play for days.

One day in 1999 I got a letter from his Mother telling me He died in a car wreck while driving drunk,he took a left turn at high speed and rolled the car.  She said he died instantly.

I rushed to his moms house, she had given most of his things to goodwill.  She pulled out the guitar and gave it to me.

For a cheap no name guitar it plays perfect.

Edit: Wow so many story's! I love the pics too!! Thanks everybody.

Recently built a Jazzmaster loosely based off of the Fender Elvis Costello edition that was in production a little while back. 

The body (extra light alder, 3 lbs 14 oz) and neck (Indian rosewood fretboard, cream inlays) are both from Warmoth. The neck came finished, just had to add the tuning machines. I finished the body with a walnut stain and a satin nitro lacquer. The goal was basically to make this thing look like a piece of furniture, which I think worked out pretty well.

Went with some Seymour Duncan Antiquity II pups which give it that bright and shimmery Jazzmaster sound. Was considering some hand wound pups, but the money I saved by using the SDs I was able to put into the Mastery bridge. Now I don't have much experience with these guitars, so I can't say that this bridge changed my life or anything, but apparently the Jazzmaster/Jaguar bridges are generally crap, so I'm happy to have one I can rely on.

Had a friend of mine set it up for me (I use 11s and love low action, so I needed to bring in a specialist). Only thing left to do is add some strap locks, but I don't mind some sit-down jams for now.

Thanks, hope you like it and feel free to ask anything.

He would look at one, but for some reason wouldn't be able to map that in his brain to the correct fretting positions. It always ended up where I had to physically move his finger to the right fret/string, which is a bad long-term strategy for teaching guitar.

It occurred to me that maybe chord charts were *slightly* too abstract for a 10 year old brain. So on a whim I drew a guitar head on the end of a chart, and a hand behind the guitar neck, to serve as a visual reference. My theory was that then he'd know intuitively how to do it just by looking.

It worked! Suddenly he was able to fret the strings in the right place, as if by magic. So once I got home I fired up Photoshop and ended up making a 9MB PDF of nice big charts that I plan to print out and use to train him on the basic open chords.

Here's a sample: http://i.imgur.com/2AU72h.jpg

My plan is to make big flash cards out of these. My purpose posting this here is, if anyone else is teaching youngsters and is having similar trouble, this may help.

I'm not trying to be offensive, so I hope none of you who do this sort of thing take it personally.

But I absolutely can't stand when I see a guitarist playing a cover song and he plays everything the way it is on the recording. ESPECIALLY with the solo.

It's an interesting discussion, because I'm sure there are people who have the exact opposite pet peeve, and they hate when people start messing around with a perfectly good song. But here's my take on it:

If I wanted to hear the song played exactly like it is on the album, I'd go listen to the album. Like, to me, doing music this way is just glorified Guitar Hero. Really, that's what it is. You go up on stage and you mash your fingers down on the frets in the same order and same way that the dude who originally recorded it did, and hopefully the same thing comes out. Your performance is evaluated based on how close it matches up with the recording artist.

Like, to me, I want to hear YOUR solo. I want to hear the emotions that you're feeling right now. I don't want to hear the emotions David Gilmour or Jimmy Page or whoever were feeling back when they originally laid the song to tape, I can hear that anytime. You might say ""Oh, but my own solo wouldn't be as good as the original!"" and yeah, you're probably right. But, and maybe this is just me, I would rather hear you play a mediocre solo that comes from your heart and was created by your mind, than to hear you play someone else's solo perfectly. 

Because music's not about being the best.

Maybe I'm crazy. I know some people don't think like I do. They hear a cover, they want to hear the original solo, with the same tone the original guitarist used. Preferably with the same guitar, as well. But me? That doesn't interest me. 

They say the original solo is sacred, and shouldn't be tampered with. Don't fix what isn't broken. Me? I say, no solo is sacred. Make the song your own, and let the purists go listen to the original in their cars if they don't like it.",,False,,t5_2qi79,False,,,True,t3_zh8jw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/zh8jw/my_beef_with_seeing_dudes_perform_live/,

60th anv. MIM fender telecaster, SNC mod shop pickups, 100% rewired/repotted. (its my baby, only wish i got the MIA for 10x the price, one extra inlay, and a once piece ash body instead of 4, lol). It came with a white pick guard, I really liked the way a black one looked on the ash body so i got one. I always wanted to make a wood pick guard and after going crazy trying to make one out of other materials(i dont have the resaw capabilities to get something that thin and wide) i recently came across some flame maple veneer, had to try. the control plate(s) i did because i went to the garage to make a pickguard, couldnt at the time, made 5 or 6 of them instead(see album below), still trying to figure out which one i like the best.

Flame maple veneer on a thin birch plywood, ebony stain, 3 layers of tung oil finish. I might put a layer of poly on it just for protection

and here's a quick demo video I did earlier, not super great quality but you get an idea (tuned to G standard in that video, FYI) (13~ minutes)


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYoNqR0vZ4Q


also here's some video of the CNC/machining (10~ minutes)


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBnLNtQ92qA

there's some info on the pictures in the gallery but here's the specs;


* Eden Neck, purchased from ebay
* body is made of Paulownia (very light but soft timber) for the back 
and 10mm of Galaxy Black Granite, on the top!


the body is designed after the B.C Rich Ignitor

(I know I know, many won't like the shape, but I just had to have one as soon as I saw them, even if a little ugly.. sort-of) 

though I've touched up the horns a bit, they're much softer, though this was also a limitation of working with stone

* body is also 55mm thick, a strat is typically 45mm

* GFS 14:1 gold tuners

* Floyd Rose Special, gold 

* GFS Power Rail humbuckers (Bridge + Neck)

* Overwound single coil middle (bought from GFS, but not GFS branded.)



as for the electronics we have

* 3 way toggle switch, this acts just like a standard 2 pickup guitar

* 2x volume knobs, one for the bridge pickup, the other for neck + single coil

* 3x DPDT switches, 

the first on the left (from the players POV) is a coil split for both humbuckers

the second adds and removes the single coil from the circuit 

the third switches the polarity of the single coil's wiring



that's about it, the strap pins are from a jackson, and i'm using a nice fender leather strap thats a bit wider than usual, to help spread the load.

though the weight of the guitar is somewhat significant, it's 4.7KG, so that's around 10.3+ pounds


if anyone has questions, go for it!

EDIT:
Thanks for all the replies!
So, what i get from your comments is mostly: Play with others and add your own twist. I have a band, but it doesnt cover all the styles i love and play, so for classic blues i'm mostly on my own :/

One thought: Can we start a collection of really great riffs/songs with emphasis on a melodic guitar?

By that i don't simply mean ALL Vai/Hendrix/vanHalen/... songs, but only riffs you fell in love with the first time you heard them.
That way, even if the magic's gone for us, we can still give it to fellow players :)

- Little Wing (Jimi Hendrix)
- Layla (Eric Clapton)

1334764339.0,156,self.Guitar,sg5l0,[NGD] Gibson Thunderhorse,Subhoney,183,27,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/sg5l0/ngd_gibson_thunderhorse/,"About a month ago, I bought a [Gibson Thunderhorse](http://www2.gibson.com/Images/Products/ElectricGuitars/Explorer/Gibson-USA/Dethklok-Explorer/Gallery-Images/DSDKSNCH1-Finish-Shot-jpg.aspx?KeepThis=true&amp;). I've [played two or three shows with it](http://i.imgur.com/IeUU6.png), so I feel like I can finally do a legitimate review. 

Gibson, for the last few years, has been putting out limited runs of guitars that fit their basic mold but have a few funky modifications. I'm a big fan of this form of product design, even though it's gimmicky and silly at times. I've bought several of their guitar-of-the-month series (SG Diablo comes to mind) for their idiosyncrasies; often, these guitars match my playing style and desire better than the Gibson standard.

The Thunderhorse is no exception.

This guitar is probably one of the strangest ""Signature"" guitars ever made; the design is by a fellow named Brendan Small, the entertainer responsible for the animated show ""Metalocolypse"". The Thunderhorse, which is a modified Explorer in the silverburst finish, is the signature guitar of  Skwisgaar Skwigelf, the guitarist for the fictional deathmetal band Dethklok. The interesting (and incredibly smart in my opinion) thing is that nowhere on the guitar is Dethklok, Skwisgaar, Metalocolypse, or even Brendan Small mentioned. To someone unfamiliar with the show, the guitar is just a pretty thing with no affiliation. It does say ""Thunderhose"" on the truss guard. 

I bought the guitar from a music store, something I don't normally do. These limited-run guitars simply don't show up on the used market very often, and I got tired of waiting on one. I paid $1000 in total, but it was a trade situation; a Gretsch Powerjet for the Gibson, one-to-one. The guitar's MSRP is $2800, and it goes for $1650 off the shelf. 

The setup from the Gibson factory (and the music store, Sam Ash, where they advertise that they have a Gibson-certified tech on site to setup all guitars that come to the factory, even going so far as to offer a setup plan where you pay a fee and get something like four setups a year) was *fucking terrible*. If you riffed at all on the low e-string, it would literally pop out of the nut and flail on the side of the guitar. This is one of the reasons the shop took the one-to-one trade: I called 'em on the awful setup job, and told them the first thing I'd have to do is replace the nut. 

Which I didn't. I took the Thunderhorse to a luthier and he was able to pull out an ULTRA low-action setup without replacing the nut. He did have to carve a little bit, but no worries. I will have to replace it at some point, probably with a different material. Also interesting: the nut is a brilliant white, and the binding is cream. They distinctly don't match. 

After setup, the thing plays like a murder machine. It's a 22-fret, low and fast. The neck's profile is Gibson's slim/fast, like the new-model Les Paul Customs. It isn't a 1950s fretless wonder baseball bat neck, and thank goodness: I like 'em kinda thin and really fast. Compared to a late model Les Paul Traditional, this is a much slicker guitar. If you take the entire neck-thickness spectrum into account, it could probably be described as medium to thin. The nut is the same size as the standard Explorer: 1.695"". The cream binding looks great too; reminiscent of the Les Paul Custom in the same finish.

The guitar's body is non-chambered mahogany. It's the same thickness and material as a standard Explorer. If you're comfortable playing a standard, the Thunderhorse will not disappoint. The finish is nitrocellulose laquer. 

The electronics are different. The two-volume-one-tone pattern holds for the knobs, and the selector is still a three-way, but the pickups are Burstbucker I (neck) and Burstbucker II (bridge); the same config as the Les Paul Customs. Tone-wise, this is where the standard Explorer an the Thunderhorse depart. When I think Explorer, I think of a dark-but-bright sound (thanks mainly to the Edge and his Vox amps). This guitar is even darker and less bright (I use an Orange Thunderverb 50, but did test on a Vox AC30 stereo rig). It has less output than my Les Paul (I may could change that by upping the poles and lowering the pickups' bodies), and has a generally darker sound. I find myself pulling the volume upward and the bass downward to pull any degree of sparkle out of the guitar. It's muddy, but in a good way. Great for chug-style down-tuned stuff, or, remarkably, the blues. You won't get that SRV kind of single coil sound of this beast, but you do get a well defined bottom end when pushing a clean amp to breakup that's indicative of guitarists like Joe Bonamossa. I was able to pull really pretty totally clean tones from the guitar that were great for jazz fusion stuff. Another kind of tone that I'm not interested in experimenting with but assume this guitar isn't appropriate for is the Steve Vai electric-ham-sandwich ultra-thin-gain-y kind of sound... the pickups just aren't those of the Jem.

All in all, it's a beautiful piece, and I'm glad I bought it. It's surprisingly versatile, comfortable, and (at least to a silverburst fanatic like me; I have three now) utterly gorgeous. The MSRP is totally ridiculous (even the list price at the store), but, if you can find a used model at the $1000 price-point, you're in for a great guitar for the money. The guitar came with a HSC and all the candy as well. My biggest complaint was that it wasn't gig-ready when I pulled it out of the case, but I shouldn't complain too hard. That fact got me the deal.

My next buy will probably be the limited run [silverburst ES-335](http://www.guitarvillage.co.uk/admin/pages/upload/Gibson%20Semi/ES335_silverburst.jpg) if one ever pops up on the used market.

I've had some good times here but overall there are some things I don't like about this subreddit that I don't think will ever change. I originally decided to unsubscribe last year and almost as I clicked the button I was asked to moderate and so wanted to help rather than abandon. On the whole I've had some great discussion here but I've been frustrated on many occasions by many things from the more subtle spamming, to a lack of good submitted content and somewhat ironically bitching about the lack of good content. Perhaps my greatest frustration though, has been the priority of karma-whoring - some of our highest upvoted comments and submissions have been inane punchlines and content bordering on memes. All the while time genuine attempts to help are left on the shelf, hiding at the bottom of a thread. 

Some of this is attributable to the perceived high-population of new guitarists, perhaps the general nature of reddit as a whole lends itself to this. There's also the matter of system gaming which can harm genuine content - if you browse /r/guitar/new you'll see valid and often original content sitting at zero votes while someone tries to push their content through. Overall this may be fine for some but it's not something I want to stand over and certainly will not contribute to.

I am removing my moderator status with immediate effect and will be silently moving on. I have no intention of changing my mind or seeking some kind of validation here but as I leave I think it is only basic courtesy to say why. Thank you for the good times, I will remember only these.

My brother decided he wanted a Telecaster after seeing Richie Kotzen playing one a few years ago but he couldn't find one he liked - the necks were too fat, the pickups were wrong or the price wasn't right. So out of boredom/frustration he decided to make his own. 

I think it's what he did with the wood that makes it so special. . . Descriptions of how and what are in the album comments - [here](http://imgur.com/a/J4Btq#0)

There's a higher quality photograph [here](http://i.imgur.com/yvUzf4H.jpg) taken by [Mark McGuigan](http://www.markmcguigan.com/_who_/) at the Edinburgh Guitar Show. 

What do you think? 

EDIT * It looks as though I forgot to label the post GEAR when I posted. Apologies if this breaks the sub-reddit rules. I promise to stake myself to a beach at low tide and await my fate. 

Edit 2* There are some Youtube videos up that give an example of how it sounds if you want to hear it. 

[30 seconds of shred](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKIASKP8jtg&amp;feature=youtu.be) 30 seconds of him looking bored and playing with a fair bit of distortion. 

[2 minutes without gain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hr4S1Bu_lI) 2 minutes (or thereabouts) of clean tone using various pickup selections.

[The Maszhcaster](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omx28z-O2kg) Clean tone again for 24 seconds. 

Edit 3* Some words from the man himself:

Cheers for responses! It's nice to know that the work is appreciated after spending so many hours working on it. The essay below details the minor points that brother might have missed.

The body came from England for £55 pre-routed as a standard Tele. The neck pickup hole had to be widened to accommodate the Di-Marzio Chopper as It was slightly too big. The body is made of Ash and remains unfinished except for an ultra thin wax sealing on it to keep the design clean. 

The neck is rock maple with a rosewood fingerboard, 12"" radius on the F/B, Dunlop 6100 fret wire and the neck back shape is a wide D shape. I went for the Strat' type neck for no other reason than I wanted it to look a little different and it was the best one I felt on the day.  It cost £100.
The pickups are DiMarzio, Tone Zone and Chopper with nothing exciting in the wiring, 3 way switch, tone and volume - dead simple. i didn't want the tone weakness that most Telecasters have so opted for high output bad boys!

The tattoo is a design on my wife's back and after being questioned about whether or not I would ever get one decided I would try my hand at burning one into the guitar I was making. The woodburner cost £16 Earth pounds-sterling.

The hardest part is patience to be honest. I had to freehand the design from the design on the computer (didn't want to cheat and print it). That took 4.5 hours in one night- hand cramped up and couldn't draw any longer. Finished the pencil drawing the next night and bought some carbon paper and stencilled it onto the body. The design around the Geisha snake woman was all freehand improvised 'Japanese style' doodling basically, few crocus flowers and wavy lines to fill the space up. 

The burning took 5 days/ nights at roughly 4.5 hrs a day. It's fairly easy to do so long as you go slow and don't push into the wood for longer than 2 seconds at a time. to be honest Ash isn't the best type of stuff to burn on and the grain on the guitar isn't COMPLETELY flat so next time, the wood will be smoother. For a first time effort and complete stab in the dark however I think it turned out really well.

We estimate the retail cost if I were to sell it would be £1100. That estimate comes from guys who make furniture etc and that's their rough guess which is quite generous I thought!

I'm getting a customised cab next, will be plain wood with some design burnt on it too, that's my next project, matching guitar and cab!

",tibbon,302,146,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/r5x6s/how_i_musically_trolled_rguitar_and_you_took_the/,"As proven by [Joshua Bell playing in a DC metro station a few years ago](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/04/AR2007040401721.html), most people don't know if something is 'good' unless someone tells them. It seems that the same is true for Reddit, including you /r/guitar. 

 
**Background**

In a [discussion about Nirvana's Unplugged concert](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/r18au/ama_request_somebody_who_was_in_the_audience_the/) someone brought up an early cover of ""Heartbreaker"" that Nirvana did, and that many people seemed to love. I pointed out that if it was any other band posting to Reddit/Youtube, that people would rip them a new one for doing a shitty cover. 

It gave me an idea. I was going to put up a clip of a very popular artist playing their own music, claim it as my own (even for a trolling experiment, I felt guilty about this) and ask for your feedback. 

**The Tarp**

I posted a link to a [Soundcloud with a performance of the solo section of ""*Stairway to Heaven*""](http://soundcloud.com/tibbon/stairway-to-heaven-solo) and claimed it as my own. Yet, it wasn't me playing, yet the guitar-god [Jimmy Page from a concert with Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck in December 1983](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKlEVtA_TGQ). It wasn't in my opinion his best performance of the song ever, but it was good enough for 20,000 audience members to not boo him offstage and ask for a refund. 

** The response **

This is where things got interesting imo. I posted this to both /r/guitar ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/r1jjg/my_bands_rendition_of_the_solo_from_stairway_to/)) and /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/r1jkn/bands_rendition_of_the_solo_section_of_stairway/))asking for feedback. On each it was downvoted more than it was upvoted, giving it a score of zero on each. Unfortunately each only got a few comments, due to it being downvoted into oblivion so many people would see it. 

- *""Guitarist sounds pretty err, shitty/sloppy? 1:32 would be quite a cool bit of improv well executed though. I mean christ some of this sounds like guitar hero, and i hate that game.""*
- *""the guitar solo is very very very sloppy. i mean its not just sloppy its out of tune. i think the guitar is out of tune.""*
- *""I hate to say it, but no.""*
- *""Sorry mate, needs to be cleaned up a lot. Has some potential though. Keep practicing. I'm not sure mine would be any better though!""*

And when I asked in response to the one if the performance would be worthy of showing Jimmy Page:

*""Seems it's just that touch beyond you. Slow it down, focus on the timing. That solo is not very complex, but has pretty spot on timing, so if you nail that, the whole thing will sound better.
Also try toning down the distortion a bit, it's a great mistake masker, but if you can sound good with the distortion down, you sound incredible with it cranked up.""*

**My Thoughts**

I feel that if I had posted a clip saying, ""I love Page's solo here"" I think people would have largely agreed that he's a great guitarist and his performance was great. Yet, as a nobody guitarist, claiming it to be mine, it was perceived as flawed. 

To me this says that people can't really separate the artist from the performance all that well. If you like the artist, you're inclined to thinking its a pretty good performance, despite mistakes and errors. I think I could have done the same with a performance by Jack White or another artist. You might have called my playing ""sloppy"" but his performance would be seen as ""artistic"" or ""with feeling"". 

To your credit, it wasn't ripped apart as much as I expected. I personally thought it was a pretty horrid performance on his part and I wonder what was wrong that night for him. I fear that if I had posted the same on Youtube, that people would have been much much harsher, as commenters on there always seem to have some bone to pick unless you're a superstar- or have boobs.

This is a big one.  I met [Dave](http://i.imgur.com/eWWm7.jpg) a while back through some wheeling and dealing I did with him.  He has been gracious enough to provide us with the opportunity to take part in an AMA right here in r/guitar.  
  
For those of you who aren't familiar with Dave or PIGTRONIX, he is the co-founder and driving force behind the company and product development.  
  
Dave is extremely knowledgeable about pedals, how they're made, and from the product line available at PIGTRONIX, a very creative dude.  

He's also extremely down to earth and approachable.  I predict this will be a fun and informative AMA.  
  
Dave's out west on business right now, but will be back sometime next week.  As soon as I gauge the interest in the AMA, I'll set up a time for him to answer all of your pedal queries.  
  
Let's do this!!!!    
  
Edit:  If the AMA's we've got planned take off and do well (i.e. high levels of participation on your part) I think we should make it a regular thing and archive them on the sidebar.    
  
This will require your help.  You probably know someone in the industry, or have a way to contact someone - anyone from techs to rock stars to luthiers.  Maybe this could be come a monthly thing.

I've been doing tweed fender restorations for a while now as they are what i enjoy working on and over the years i've amassed a pretty nutty collection of amps and guitars.
I've been in touring bands,run live sound and recorded bands in a former life and still enjoy doing that on the side for fun but, i thought i should just introduce myself and show a bit of my collection.

So a few months ago I posted a pic of an SG I got for a steal (a guy was going to sell it to a local store for $50 so I offered him more).

I love the weight (well, lack thereof) of an SG and the fact that it has 24 frets is just an added bonus, but I don't particularly like one pickup guitars. Also it was an ugly rust red color. So I routed out for a neck pickup, used a 57 classic, and painted it white. Put in some new grover tuners, and replaced the old mini toggle coil split with a 3 way selector, and made the tone pot a push pull to split both pickups.

In March 2010 I was days away from living entirely alone for the first time. I came home from work at lunch one day and found my neighbours panicking about a collapsed ceiling in one of their bedrooms, I dragged my happy ass up into the (shared) attic to check out the damage and found a bunch of my old stuff was precariously perched around the hole, so I took it all downstairs to let whatever work needed to be done get done and, when the other person I was living with moved out, I picked up the guitar and started playing. The first half of this video is from that same night, and is the earliest recording I have, the second half is from a song I started learning a few days ago - 21 months after fate did me a solid (while fucking over my neighbours in the process) and put that guitar back in my hands.

I've still got a hell of a long way to go, but I figured it was worth sharing - it's amazing what a difference practicing like a motherfucker for a couple of years can make!

A great teacher who taught me a lot and left a lasting impression on me.  His last name started with Senj or Seng as in Sengakowski (pronunciation and spelling is estimated).  

I remember sitting in awe of him playing Eruption (from Van Halen) and his patience with sitting and watching me play.  I spent hours translating Stairway to Heaven into Tabs and showed to to him which I remember him being really impressed.  He was a really good guy and I'd love to get back in touch with him.

In all fairness I am not that bad, but then I guess neither are you. If you're intermediate and wanting to improve - read on.

I started playing guitar because my Dad had a 12 string Washburn and the moment I picked it up I just fell in love with the clear and crisp tones. After my first few guitars you could say I continued to play as a way to express my creativity. 

A lot of people like me in my early days had a misconception about music thinking it is simply a creative art - Music is more of a creative science.

You could say I am a creative guitarist who is self taught, like a lot of us, and you could also say I have a hard time rendering any piece of music perfectly. Have the same problem? - read on!

When you pick up your guitar for a jam session you might want to once again express your creativity, and when you're learning a cover or new song, if you're like me you might often end up just saying ""Ok that's close enough"". Also worth mentioning that you can never have enough patience if you want to master guitar playing. 

We see the stars we like, playing the songs we like and think ""That's fucking cool"", so we youtube for example ""Fade to black lesson"", see someone else pulling off an amazing rendition and think ""I'll have that down in a day"" - We have a problem - We're seeing the end result, and feeling anxious already because we're not there yet. 

How do they play that song so perfectly? What is their secret, are they naturally more talented than me? 

What I've realized is to play something well, you need to revert back to the tried and trusted system professional musicians have been using since the beginning of time. You need to break down the music into sections, and put in an enormous amount of repetition per section.  

IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS - You will always suck! I know I still suck (a bit). 


Let me be very clear - there is nothing creative about repetition. And this is what makes the difference between a good guitarist who still sucks and a great guitarist who doesn't. There is no magic - What it comes down to is who put in the most amount of repetition. 

This is not a glamorous process. I always feel like I'm a robot when I'm putting in the repetition, and eventually I've just had enough - Wrong again! If you want to get good put in the repetition and deal with it - There isn't any other way. 

Go right back to basics for each riff. Play it damn slow and get every note 100% correct. Every little subtle sound - play it damn tight. Every little hammer and slide - nip them in the butt! Expect to put in 10 times the effort than you originally thought was your worst case scenario. I'm coming across this learning blues. Blues sounds great if it's tight, but screw up notes here and there, and your Great playing can quickly come off sounding average or unrehearsed. 

DON'T SPEED UP TOO QUICKLY and get all excited because you're nearly there. Then at speed you're making mistakes all over the place. 

Your live playing might pass off as semi decent to a bunch of drunk people, but your stumbling fingers become apparent when you're recording and there is no perfection. 


I know it sounds boring, and I know it isn't exactly inspirational, but if you want to get better (like I do), it is about time we stop thinking we're guitar heros, and start putting in much more time and have a much more professional approach and be willing to repeat , repeat, repeat, and slowly, speeding up over time - gradually. 

If it's too robotic for you, you'll always suck. 

THE END. 

EDIT: I thought I would upload a track to prove my point here: http://soundcloud.com/a_wesome777/dust-in-the-wind-cappo. This is my rendition of Dust in the Wind. Nice enough, but far from perfect. To get it better requires considerable more effort than I realized and I gave up too soon.

(You're welcome).",YouFuckingRetard,178,33,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/15dzus/the_advice_thread_i_went_through_most_of_the_old/,"Here are the top pieces of advice for beginners and anyone else struggling! It may not be the best advice, but it is the most common advice given out here.

**Most Common Advice:**

* **Learn Scales/Chords/Music Theory.** By far the most prevalent. Learning scales and chords help take you from, ""Move this finger there, then move this finger there, then this finger..."" to ""Oh, it's C!"" so you don't have to think about where your fingers are going; it becomes automatic. *Theory makes learning new songs, soloing, and writing new music much easier.* Practice them in every position and every key (you should probably learn positions and keys). At the very least, learning these will not make you worse at guitar.

* **Take Lessons.** You'll have to swallow your pride, but you'll reach your musical goals a hell of a lot quicker, as your practice time becomes a lot more productive when noodling isn't your only end goal. Get a book, ask a friend who can already play, go to a local music store, or use the internet. Almost everyone in the threads who recommended lessons recommended www.justinguitar.com.

* **Learn how to tune your guitar (and other basic maintenance).** Your playing will sound shitty if you are ridiculously out of tune. Either learn how to tune by ear or get a good electronic tuner. Learning other basic maintenance, such as changing a string, adjusting the string height, and setting your intonation, will make your guitar easier to play and improve your playing.

* **Improve your rhythm with a metronome.** Or a drum loop machine. Or play along with records. That little click will piss you off so much, but you'll thank it when you're playing in time. Especially if you're trying to develop speed. Start slow, then speed up gradually.

* **Play with other musicians.** It'll help you rise up to their level. Plus it's always good to be humbled every now and then by someone better than you; it keeps your ego in check.

**Almost as common:**

* **Practice.** Plenty of musicians shun the word, but to me, practice is about finding what makes a song/solo run/chord progression/etc. difficult to play, breaking it down into smaller pieces, mastering the small pieces one by one, then putting those pieces back together. This takes focus and determination, but you improve a lot faster.

* **Use your ear.** Learn songs and other solos by ear. That is, listen to it carefully and try to play it note for note on the guitar. It'll improve your feel. Just so you know, there may be some times where what sounds good to your ear conflicts with what you know about music theory. When this happens, **your ear trumps your theory**. If it sounds right, it is right. Plus, on a more advanced level of theory, the ""wrong note"" works out.

* **Learn songs all the way through, not just that one part you really like** When you play for other people, they want to hear songs more than they want to hear you solo. I have two arguments for this statement:

     * Ask a random person if they've heard of Joe Satriani. Or Yngwie Malmsteen. Or Michael Angelo Batio. Then ask that same person if they know John Lennon. Or Bob Marley. Or Kurt Cobain. Let me know when someone knows more people from the first group then the second.
     * [Which audience would you rather have?](http://www.leragecomics.com/index.php/rage-comics/le-guitar/).

* **Get out of your comfort zone.** It's not fun playing with someone who only plays rock. Or blues. Or punk. The more styles you know, the more people will want to play with you.

**Not as common (but still very important):**

* **Either alternate pick or finger pick.** I'm sure there are plenty of guitarists out there who either use only their thumb (John Lee Hooker comes to mind) or only strum down (Punk Rock), but at some point, it's just a bad habit that will keep you from branching out into more complicated rhythms.

* **Have Fun.** Experiment with the scales, with the tone knobs on your amp, with pedals, and have a blast doing it. If you're not enjoying yourself, what's the point?

* **Fix your Posture.** It'll make playing easier and save you years of hand cramps and carpal tunnel.

* **With gear, you get what you pay for.** If you buy a cheap, shitty guitar/amp/effect, you will get a cheap, shitty guitar/amp/effect. If you buy used gear, you get used (but not necessarily cheap) gear. Do your homework before you buy, or you're wasting your money on something that will break down or end up collecting dust in the corner.

* **Work with dynamics.** You might find out that playing something quiet can be just as intense as turning everything up to 11. Bonus practice exercise from Jerry Garcia: Turn everything up all the way, then pick as quietly as you can. It'll give you control over your picking and give you a range of loud to soft.

**Last but not least: NEVER, EVER, EVER, GIVE UP.** The truth is, everyone sucks when they first start. What separates the musicians you know from those that never were is that the good ones stuck with it until they didn't suck anymore. It takes time, effort, focus, and a lot of frustration, but it's worth it.",,False,,t5_2qi79,1356380953.0,,,True,t3_15dzus,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/15dzus/the_advice_thread_i_went_through_most_of_the_old/,

So I decided to show off in front of my friends and play Paradise City, which I had just looked at the tabs not even two days ago. I played it, and boy was it horrible. Not only did I make mistakes, but I made mistakes on tabs that had mistakes. So, after that embarrassment, I pretty much did nothing practice. It has been about two or three years since that happened, and yesterday, for some reason, this memory popped back into my mind. So, I put Paradise City on my iPod and, to my surprise, tabbed the song out in my mind in about two to three hours, and then played through it almost flawlessly. Needless to say, I made myself pretty proud. ",,False,,t5_2qi79,False,,,True,t3_1282lr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Guitar/comments/1282lr/when_was_the_moment_you_realized_all_your/,
