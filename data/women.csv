There's not much explaining necessary as she does all that in the message, but I thought Reddit might want to have a read.

""I know you probably don't remember last night and how you were sexist to me, but I need to send you a message about it or I will kick myself.

Basically you told me that my glasses are ugly and when I laughed and asked why the fuck I should care about that, you said, ""Girls should be pretty"". I said I would rather be funny, smart and a good person and give no flying fucks about being beautiful, but you held the absurd belief that a girl should be beautiful and that is her main aim in life so I moved to the other end of the train.

I was not upset that you said my glasses were ugly. I do not care about that. What I do care about is that you were perpetuating the sexist notion that a woman's worth and purpose is solely based on her physical beauty and this enrages me. Our society brainwashes women from a young age that we need to look a certain way to be good enough, whether it be through Disney movies or Maybelline commercials. We are never thin enough, our boobs are never big enough, and they've even created fake lashes because apparently out eyelashes are not long enough.

So many of the most clever, caring and funny individuals that I know are made to believe daily that they are not good enough by society and by drunk guys on trains purely cause they do not fit society's mold of beauty. And this fucking sucks.

So next time you want to comment on a woman's looks and how it doesn't fit your idea of beauty, just pause for a second, think of all the women you love (family, friends, lovers) and think of how shitty a comment like that would make them feel and put yourself in their shoes.

Sorry if this is long.

I can't do it, I'm just going to have to stick to the facts and hope that some of you will take the time to read further.

80% of the global supplies of coltan, cobalt and cassiterite are mined in the Congo. Those minerals go into our phones, televisions, laptops. There is a war being fought for control of the mines. International mineral companies are [fuelling the war](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8159977.stm). More than four million people have died. Guerrilla fighters use rape and mutilation to destroy villages, attacking any woman, from tiny babies to the elderly. The level to which rape, torture and death has affected these people is unimaginable to me. 

I know a girl who made a documentary about all of this. If you're in the UK, you should be able to watch it [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00rvbsj/The_Worlds_Most_Dangerous_Place_for_Women/). Maybe someone more tech-savvy than I can find a way to watch it elsewhere? Here are some [links](http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2010/mar/28/congo-women-danger-war-judith-wanga), to newspaper [articles](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/08/AR2007090801194.html). A list of companies that use minerals mined in the East Congo can be found [here](http://www.friendsofthecongo.org/new/coltan.php). 

I really just want to raise awareness. That so many women could be so brutally attacked, and not have it raise outrage world-wide, is completely shattering to me. I don't know what else to do but try to let people know, and try to put some pressure on companies to source their materials ethically.


Edit:
Here are some ways to help. [One](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mariska-hargitay/how-we-can-all-help-women_b_502411.html), [two](http://www.runforcongowomen.org/), [three](http://www.womenforwomen.org/global-initiatives-helping-women/help-women-congo.php). I don't know all that much about Women for Women, but it seems good. [This article](http://www.msmagazine.com/spring2005/congo.asp) mentions that you can donate directly to a hospital through the [Swedish Pentecostal Mission](http://www.missioncouncil.se/%20english/members/spm_e.html) (website in Swedish, but their contact details are at the bottom of the article). 
You can contact the UN, and urge them to do more to help.
You can raise awareness and put pressure on companies to stop using products mined in the DRC. You can tell everyone you know. Write letters to newspapers, politicians, and anyone else you can think of who could help raise awareness and make changes.

I had two kids already, but was in good physical shape. He was always a big bear type guy, tall and soft, but not fat. His friends made comments about how I was cute, and I could tell he felt proud to be with me. Fast forward 10 years. 

He lost 40lbs, and looks good. Men, I think, tend to age better anyway, so his grey hairs just make him look hotter to me, and now he's all fit looking too. 

Me? I'm about 25lbs overweight. We had two more kids, and my body owns motherhood on every inch of it, from my tired eyes, to my doughy center, to my half painted toenails. I'm suddenly embarrassed to be seen with my husband. I don't want his friends to see pictures of me. I know what people are thinking when they see us together... How did she get a guy like that? He could do so much better. She must have been pretty when she was younger and just let herself go. I feel this sense of being an utter disappointment. Worthless. 

I make twice his salary. I am strong and loving and carry our household on my shoulders. I raise our 4 boys. I take care of all the details. I cook wonderful meals. I am kind to his family. We laugh together and we like all the same things. I should be proud of me, proud of everything I've accomplished, and everything I do. But I'm not - so much of my self worth is tied in to the size of the pants I'm wearing. I'm not worthy of my babe of a husband, because I'm fat fatty fat fat. Because I'm not pretty enough for him now. 

Why? Why do we go along with this? Why do we think this way? 

I just wanted to find some place to get this out of my head. Thanks for reading. 

tl;dr - I'm amazed by how our fluctuating body sizes have impacted the way I feel about being with my husband over the past decade. Now that I'm fat and he's thin, I feel unworthy despite having built a very happy and successful life together.

[r/Pics post of Cayla and her Husband Seth, happy even in the face of deportation](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ulzxj/these_pictures_are_of_an_amazing_couple_that/)

Here is her story: 

Cayla is a charitable honors student about to graduate from Western Michigan University with degrees in psychology and interpersonal communications. Cayla is also a victim of Sex Smuggling and is risking deportation now that she is no longer a child. 

Living in China at the age of 12, her parents birthed a young boy. They were violating China’s one child policy. She had always been a disappointment in the eyes of her parents, but now she was worse. 

&gt;""The potato (is) worth more than you; they can feed people, what can you do?"" she recalled her father saying.
 
Two years later her mother died. The father then decided it was time to rid his life of his daughter. He decided to sell her into sex slavery. At the age of 14. He even expected her to send money back home to her family. 

&gt;""I have took care of you for 14 years now, and it's your time to give back,"" she recalled. 

She was sold to the Sex Smugglers known as [Snakeheads.]( http://news.sky.com/home/uk-news/article/15799328)
They brought her to California, where she was thankfully rescued by the San Diego PD.
She was found a foster home, and got a 3.97 GPA throughout school.  She volunteered for Hurricane Katrina relief, an adult clinic, homeless shelter, and to fix houses for those in need. She even became a mentor for Autistic children. 
&gt;""She perservered obviously through tough times getting here,"" said her English as Second Language (ESL) teacher Ben Lawrence. ""But once she was here, she wanted to learn English, get top grades, take the hardest classes we could offer here at Grand Haven, and she did it. She just had an incredible drive."" 

Now she is attending Western Michigan University, about to graduate. She met Seth Roberts in high school and they got married when he returned from the Air Force. 

Up until now, this story serves as an example of a strong-willed individual, finding success despite being faced with extreme hardships. Finding a new family to love her after her own threw her away, finding true love, bettering herself and helping those in need. She has been a personification of Mental Strength. 

But this isn’t the end of the story. Now ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) wants to deport her. She has been denied every attempt at staying. They denied her to stay for her marriage, they denied her asylum for religious persecution, and earlier they denied her to stay under  “Juvenile” status because of confusion over her date of birth. 

Cayla did not come here of her own free will. She was tossed away, and taken here. Without papers, without money, alone and lost.  After her rescue, she flourished in a loving environment. Now we all risk throwing her away again.  The Snakeheads have threatened her for years, if she is deported, she risks their retaliation. If she were lucky enough to avoid that, there is that issue of her father. 

&gt;""There's no home for you here anymore, and there's two options if you ever come home,"" she quoted him as saying. ""One option is, either I will kill you, cuz there's no home for you here anymore, or I will just give you a bottle of medicine and you can take care of it yourself, just kill yourself."" 

If she eludes her father and the Snakeheads, she would still be forced to live in a country that views her as a traitor. She would have to ask permission from China to become a citizen of the US, and this would take years. In these years, she would be living in fear for her life. 

But this doesn’t have to happen. The Obama administration has created something for ICE called “[Prosecutorial Discretion]( http://www.ice.gov/doclib/secure-communities/pdf/prosecutorial-discretion-memo.pdf)” for cases such as this. It is supposed to be exercised to block deportation of people who are at risk, such as victims of sex smuggling or human trafficking. The problem is, out of 219,000 cases reported to ICE for Prosecutorial Discretion, only 7.5% of them have been approved. Given her track-history with ICE, the outlook is grim. 

This is where you can come in. Do you wish to help Cayla, her husband, and her new family? There is a way you can. [Here is her Change.org petition.](http://www.change.org/petitions/cayla-roberts) Sign it. We hope that gathering thousands of signatures to show support for Cayla might help ICE reach a positive decision. 
If you can think of any other ways to help, by all means do it. I’m just an ordinary man, but I’m trying to promote her story in any way I can. THANK YOU for taking the time to read this. 

**tl;dr: Cayla is a victim of Human Trafficking, is a successful member of American Society and is risking Deportation. Help her by signing her [petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/cayla-roberts) and/or in any other way you can think of. Thanks!**

Some of the most dynamic global advocates for women spoke – from Hillary Clinton and Oprah to Angelina Jolie and Dr. Mamphela Ramphele, who may soon campaign to become the president of South Africa.

I was very honored to represent Women on Fire as one of the 2,500 attendees from around the globe.

During the two days, there was so much presented to digest about the condition of women -- our rights, our health, our education and our future.

So, my personal goal was to return from the conference with at least one concrete step or strategy that could improve your life, mine and other women’s as well.

Thanks to hearing so many courageous women tell their stories at the Summit, I found what we must do -- or rather, what we must not do.

What these women who survived being raped, beaten, starved, kidnapped, abused, marginalized, shot at, married off at age 11, sent to orphanages, denied education and more had in common was this:

They did not view themselves as victims. Ever.

They found a thread of hope and clung to it.

They turned their pain into advocacy.

They transformed their seemingly impossible dreams into reality.

And in doing so, they are alive and well and telling their stories and advocating for women who are still under the most adverse and sub-human conditions.

It is disheartening in this 21st century that so many women and girls continue to be owned and traded like cattle, defiled, denied education and physically and emotionally abused – and worse, if that’s even possible to imagine.

I hope you have a chance to watch Michaela’s, Malala’s and Tererai’s video stories and be inspired by how they transformed their extreme adversities into an ocean of hope for all of us.

To wild applause, Hillary Clinton reinforced what nearly all speakers said:

“Women are not victims. We are agents of change and drivers of progress.”

My beloved Women On Fire, we must band together and create the changes so necessary for the world.

(And, thank you to so many of you reading this who are working so hard to help women move forward.)

“A thousand spider webs can tie up the fiercest lion” has always been one of my favorite African proverbs.

We must make sure we are not holding ourselves back from sharing our gifts with the world because we feel or act as though we are victims -- on any front.

When I became a coach nearly two decades ago, a therapist friend of mine shared with me the five behaviors that characterize people acting as victims:

They blame.
They avoid.
They whine.
They label negatively others or the situation.
They are sarcastic.

I shudder to think of the times I play a victim.  I really prefer to think I don’t, but that would not be true.

I blame when things don’t go my way; I whine when I think I’ve been treated unfairly; I label negatively and plot revenge (even though I don’t act on it) when I think someone has mistreated someone I love or care about.

What became so clear last week is that none of my being a victim will ever change anything for the better.

What I must do is re-dedicate my energy to stand tall and brave, alongside my fierce sisters in this country and around the world, who courageously stand up to outdated traditions that limit women, who are peacemakers in face of violence, and who rise above deplorable conditions to achieve better lives for themselves and others.

The least I can do is to not play a victim in my own daily, privileged life.

1361736868.0,69,self.women,195bn8,My beef with pubic hair ,PinkSpaghetti,98,29,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/195bn8/my_beef_with_pubic_hair/,"Taken from the brilliant, award winning Caitlan Moran from her satirical book 'How to be a Woman'. I know it's a wall of text, but it's well worth the read. Enjoy!

'And of all these hair dilemmas, it is pubic hair that is now the most politically changed arena. That palm sized triangle has come to be top loaded with more psychosexual interference than martial status and income combined. Over the years, pubic hair has gone from being the least of women's worries- when I was 17, around BritPop, the idea of waxing your bikini line was bizarre, marginal, for porn models only- to a pretty routine part of 'self care'. Pubic hair must be confined to very small area, or, increasingly removed completely. The industry standard pop-video crotch shots of girls in bikinis make it very very clear: there should be nothing there. It must be smooth. Empty. You must clear this area of fur. To see even a single hair, curling to the side, would have the whole world going, 'Is this a PUBE I can see? A PUBE, Lady Gaga?'.

Whilst some use the euphemism of 'Brazilian' to describe this state of affairs, I prefer to call it what it is- 'a ruinously high-maintenance, itchy, cold-looking, child's fanny'.
I am aware my views on waxing run contrary to current thinking. It is now accepted that women will wax. We never had a debate about it. It just happened- and we never thought to discuss it. 
Even though we are living through a time of pube disapproval, I was still, nonetheless, shocked by a recent letter to the The Times's sex columnist, Suzi Godson, from a 38 year old divorcee, worried about her retro muff, saying her boyfriend was 'shocked' at her lack of hygiene. Somewhat naively, I thought The Times columnist- a feisty looking chick, with the peroxide hair of a sassy 1950's telephone operator, would quickly tell her correspondent's boyfriend to go to hell. 

Instead, she took a sadly chiding tone. 'Things have rather changed in the genital grooming department' she began, explaining that 'Any woman who dares to be less rigid in her styling, as you have found, risks being labelled as bucolic, unsanitary or possibly French. If your boyfriend has been conditioned to expect a tidy Brazilian, he may genuinely find anything else very off putting'. She ended her piece with one of the most annoying pieces of 'good news' I've ever heard.

'Fortunately,' she said, 'the craze for Brazilians is abating. The hot new hair cut is the Sicilian, you are left with a neat little Sicily shaped triangle, which at least means you still look like a woman. Good luck!'
Sicily? The good news is I can make my vagina look like Sicily? Home of the Mafia? That's my vagina now? 'It's got the Godfather in it? Ha ha! Can you imagine if we asked men to put up with this shit? They'd laugh you out of the window before you got halfway through the first sentence.

I can't believe we've got to the point where it's basically costing us money to have a fanny. God DAMN you, mores-of-pornography-that-have-made-it-into-my-pants. GOD DAMN YOU!

And of course, it's pornography that's costing us all this money, time and follicular pain. If you ask the question, 'Why do 21st century women feel they have to remove all of their pubic hair?' the answer is, 'Because everyone does it porno'. Hollywood waxing is now total industry standard. Watch any porn made after, say 1988, and it's all hairless down there: close ups are like watching one of the Mitchell brothers, with no eyes, eating a very large fidgety sausage.

But the hairlessness isn't there for the exitingness. It's not, disappointingly, there to satisfy a kink. f it were, I could argue it until the cows literally came home. Nah- it seems the real reason all porn stars wax is because, if you remove all the fur, you can see more when you're doing penetrative shots. And that's it. This gigantic, billion-dollar, Western obsession with Brazilians, that millions of normal women have to time events in their lives around, endure pain and inconvenience for- and, I regret to tell you ladies, actually makes your thighs look bigger- is all down to the technical considerations of cinematography. It's just a lighting thing. 

Given that it's simply an 'industry thing', it's like ladies! This shit doesn't apply to us! We don't need to bother! We're not getting paid for this! Grow your little minge fro back! Be hair now!

But, of course, it does apply to us, as I've said:because hard core pornography is now the primary form of sex education in the Western world. This is where teenage boys and girls learn what to do to each other and what to expect when they take each other's clothes off. As a result, we're at risk of a situation in which every boy expects to undress a girl and find a thorough wax job, and every girl- terrified by the idea of being rejected, or though abnormal- waxes for them. My beautician told me she has had girls of 12 and 13 coming in for Brazilians- removing the first signs of adulthood even as they appear, in a combination that- with its overtones of infantilisation and hardcore pornography- is pretty creepy, whichever way you look at it'.",,False,,t5_2qh8d,False,,,True,t3_195bn8,http://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/195bn8/my_beef_with_pubic_hair/,

Thought you might be able to help.,,103,37,216,http://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/c0w10/hey_women_of_reddit_got_in_a_big_argument_with_my/,"First off, I consider myself a feminist, as does my girlfriend.  While I have the urge to look at pornography, I do not because I know it will upset her.  I was trying to explain this to her tonight, and that I felt my urges where natural among genders, it seemed she could not understand where I was coming from and a huge event resulted.

So, my primary questions are, do women see attractive men and wonder what it would be like to see them naked or even have sex with them, while still only wanting to be with their significant other? ...and also, how many women truly get turned on by watching specific pornography alone or with their significant other?  By specific pornography, I mean non-demeaning stuff.  If clarification is required, let me know.

**tl;dr**: If you are a woman, what are your views on pornography?  And do you get urges to view nude pictures of other people on their own, or having sexual relations?  Also, as a theoretical/philosophical question, how do you think society has influenced the way you feel?

You may make or break my relationship, so thanks for any honest input.

**Also** Please upvote if you can.  I really really really love this girl.  My user name is made up, and will be deleted after this post is finished, so it's not a karma thing.  However, this could provide an extremely huge influence on my relationship and life.

Thanks, reddit.

Please take a look at it. For my part, I see a lot of redditors coming to the opinion that the girl was a tease and either deserved it (by way of not taking herself out the situation) or really wanted it despite her verbal protests. 

Please, am I over-reacting. It is a murky situation but a verbal ""no, stop"" should mean exactly as it sounds. If you set up a limit far before you get into the bedroom, it should not be ethical to push past that and simply call it poor judgement.

My mother-in-law, (who is not accustomed to Anglo culture and finds it strange that my husband and sons help around the house), started teasing him. When she walked away my son grumbled, ""That's what I get for doing women's work.""

Of course I corrected him and said that most dishwashers at restaurants are men. I asked if cooking was ""women's work"" and he said, ""mostly"" and I told him most of the world's best chefs were men. I also started talking about how women are in all industries that men are in - astronauts, mechanics, computer programming, etc. He was sort of like, ""I know, I know, I didn't mean it that way. I know we're all equal.""

I don't want to ""lecture"" him about it, but now I would like to show him a movie/video/book that might solidify what we discussed. I don't want him to be the typical ""Make me a sandwich"" Reddit male some day. Any recommendations?

**EDIT**

Thanks for all your responses. You've all been of great help.

- As for why my mother-in-law is not getting the lecture: I don't often step to her because it isn't worth the drama. We don't have a good relationship and she is always looking to play victim and twist my words to make me look like I'm mean to her. I made a remark to her, something like, ""Don't be jealous just because your husband and sons didn't help you with your housework"", but that's as far as I took it. I will have my husband talk to his mother if anything similar happens again though.

- On the ""typical make-me-a-sandwich Reddit male"" remark: Look, I know some of you guys are just ""joking"" with those kinds of comments, and I know some of you don't even make comments like that. Many of you guys are really awesome, and that's why I still hang out in Reddit. Over all, this is one of the best communities on the internet - BUT - there are a lot of (albeit, probably younger, immature), males on Reddit who make sexist jokes. I almost backspaced over that part of my post because I knew it would tick some people off, but it is what it is. 

- For those who think making my son read a book/watch a video/movie is punishment: He would not see it that way, otherwise I wouldn't do it. I'm not trying to punish him, (which is why I cut the ""lecture"" very short. I just wanted to make a quick point and not bore him to tears.) ... My son likes reading and watching movies and I wouldn't force him to read/watch something like ""Feminism 101: How to be a man in the 21st Century"" --- I was looking for something a bit more subtle, (like ""Bend it Like Beckham"", a movie about a girl who goes against traditional roles because she wants to play soccer professionally.)

- On modeling non-traditional roles in the household: I totally agree that this is the best way. My husband does already help around the house doing laundry and vacuuming, and I do yard work/household repairs every now and then. Maybe we should make more of an effort to push that a little further every now and then. Thanks.

- My son's sense of humor: Yes, he has a great sense of humor and I know he was only ""joking"" - it's just that I don't find these kinds of jokes very funny. He's smart enough to make much wittier jokes.

- To those who gave actual book recommendations/links: Thanks!

The shooter ranting for pages and pages about how women are just shit and how 30 million women have rejected him and how every black guy deserves a ""white ho"" every 3-4 months and how he is entitled to a woman goddammit! and how he would shelve his plans if a woman would sleep with him - this is not the ""real reason"" for the shootout I guess. The fact that he shot a bunch of *women* is of no consequence in determining his motivations either, I suppose. 

It's part of this trend where sexism is rarely ever acknowleged as such, misogyny less so. Even rape is never called rape in the headlines anymore, it's watered down to ""sexual assault"" and statements like ""the man had sex with the two year old girl"". 

Bah. This is just one of those days when reddit's sexism feels overwhelming.

For the better part of this month, I've been experiencing early signs of pregnancy (swollen breasts, light cramping out of the usual time frame, hormone storm, etc.) I wanted to wait until my next period to see if I even got one, if it was abnormal, etc. before taking a test. I didn't want to be pregnant, and buying a test made me feel like I was admitting I was worried which would make it happen or something.. but I was very, very worried because I felt very, very strongly that I was.

I started my period three days ago. There was more brownish spotting like I usually see at the end of my period, and heavy cramping which is pretty normal for me. Anyway, I was taking a shower yesterday and noticed something odd and unusual. Something fell out of me that I'd never seen before. It was really almost like a giant sperm in shape. The ""head"" of it was deep red, with a texture almost like a pomegranate seed. It was the shape of the cotton tip on a Q-tip, but slightly larger. It was squishy, I guess, but wouldn't pop when prodded. It had a long whispy tail that was probably two or three inches long.

The day after my period started, (the same day I saw the thing in the shower,) the soreness in my breasts went away which is really weird, because my boobs are usually super tender when I'm on my period. Today, I'm having extreme cramps and lower back pain which I see can be a sign of miscarriage. I'm also bleeding goopy, dark, thick blood which I believe to be uterine lining, as opposed to blood. It doesn't disperse when disposed of in the toilet at all- merely stays wrapped around the tampon all the way down the drain. Alternatively, I scrubbed my house up and down yesterday so I don't know if that has anything to do with it.

Does anyone have any idea what's going on? What I saw didn't resemble a baby at all, but if I were pregnant, it would be 5 weeks as a generous estimate. I've been googling all day got pictures, info, etc. and nothing seems to show or describe what is happening.

I realize this probably isn't the place to post this, so if any of you ladies can direct me to where I need to be, I would appreciate it so much. I figured this was the best place to start.",,False,,t5_2qh8d,False,,,True,t3_12oupi,http://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/12oupi/nsfl_girly_question_dont_know_where_to_turn/,

I've been a SAHM long enough to know we don't always get respect for what we do, but I have to say I was pretty shocked about how rabid some of these guys were in their insistence that I should juggle both career and children - as if it is their business or choice to make!

""There is no evidence beyond the barest speculation that allowing the abortion of nonviable fetuses generates a culture in which people take a more callous attitude toward the slaughter of children or adults. Abortion is, in effect, freely permitted in many European countries, and these are much less violent societies than many American communities are now or were when abortion was still mostly forbidden.""
the late Ronald Dworkin 

In the last 200 years, we've redefined many things on this planet. Who can vote. Who are considered people. Who can marry. What marriage is (hint: it's different now because you can't sell your daughter for 60 cows and 4 goats, and if you're widowed you don't automatically shack up with your ex hubby's brother). Abortions have been around since time immemorial. The Romans even harvested to extinction a certain plant that would induce abortions. 

Most modern abortions (88%) are performed before the first trimester is finished. Only 2% of abortions occur after 21 weeks, and these are cases where the fetus is wanted, but either the fetus is in danger (which endangers the mom), or the mom's health is in danger, meaning neither of them would survive if she continued. Very rarely does a woman not realize she's pregnant, but in some cases periods continue, and birth control continues. Proper medical specialists, by the way, will never allow their personal beliefs to interfere with the patient's wishes and requests. There are many young doctors, and doctors in training that don't hold on to archaic ideals and always put the patient's comfort and safety as a priority. 

FYI, my taxes pay for many things I disagree with, including the government's salary. I indirectly pay for guns that kill families overseas. I indirectly pay for many things that go against my beliefs, but if it makes my country a better place for people to live happily, so be it. 

Now, even if everybody concedes that a fetus has personhood, it still does not have more rights over my body than any other person, not a president, not a rapist, not a boyfriend. I can hear y'all getting ready to argue- but what about the fetus's body? Here's the answer: it's inside the woman's body. It's growth directly effects her body, organs, joints, and health. 

Let's use an example to make this pregnancy situation clearer. There's a guy in the hospital, and his kidneys are failing. You're the only perfect match, and you live 1000 miles away. He would not survive a surgery to take a kidney (the risk of rejection is too great), so the hospital informs you that, if you were hooked up in a bed beside this man, they could ensure his survival if your kidneys filter his blood for him. You'd have to pay your own cab fare to come to the hospital after work, every single day, and you can't eat sushi or peanuts any more (the man is allergic to peanuts, but they are your favorite food). Every day you'd have to make this journey (sometimes twice), fighting car sickness as the cab swerves crazily through traffic each time. This man has a giant family that loves him very much, and they are all sad to see him in the hospital. 
So, now your options are to a) Let the man die or b) become his kidney slave for a whole year. You're selfish if you don't do it, and you'd be saving a life. He's a person, and so innocent, he never asked this to happen to him! You can put up with nausea and avoiding foods and bodily invasion and paying for cab fare, it's not that inconvenient! You're the only match, you're so selfish if you don't save him. His whole family is counting on you and praying that you'll change your mind and be a kidney filter.

This is what you're asking women to do when you're asking them to carry a pregnancy against their will. Except in the above scenario, there's no health problems for you, and no incapable dependent that shows up after the year, that you need to pay for and raise with manners and appropriate taste and ideals and socialization. Because if you don't, you're still selfish and a bad mother and you should have thought about children before having sex (never mind that it's never asked whether she was on birth control or any of the situation surrounding her situation).

Once again, children are made into a consequence and punishment for women who dare to control their pleasure by having sex. Sex is one of the many things that has been redefined in the last hundred years or so. We've evolved past the animalistic stage where sex is only for reproduction. We now have sex to relieve stress, bond with lovers, experience intimacy, and grow as people. With all the nerves in the clitoris, it's impossible to believe that women are destined solely for reproductive sex. The main function of the clitoris is pleasure. Intercourse for pleasure is inevitable as the sun rising and setting.  

When abortions were illegal in the states, bodies of women would turn up at the morgue all the time as a result from back-alley abortions. The day Roe vs Wade was passed and abortions were legalized for women, the deaths stopped overnight. That's powerful. That's why I'm pro-choice. Women always need a safe alternative that won't destroy their health. 

The Kermit Gosnell situation, by the way, was created by the Pro-Life mindset. Women didn't have safe, legal, nearby access to abortion, so they went desperately to that butcher (because he was in the same state as they were, they didn't need to cross borders or increase travel fees). He was performing infanticide, by the way, not abortion- those infants could have survived outside the womb. Not all abortion clinics function this way, and any late term abortion should be performed in a hospital. That situation is sickening and is the reason there needs to be regulated, legal clinics. Back alley butchers like that will only increase in number if abortion is made illegal. 

Children need proper parenting and loving care. Children that grow up without it know the difference. I know. I've felt what absent-parenting is like. If I had been aborted, or if my older brother (the result of rape) had been aborted, I'm sure my mother's life would have been very different, and a lot happier. Children didn't fix anything in her life, we just made her give up on everything sooner. 

Not everybody is equipped for parenting. Not everybody is ready for that responsibility.
Rethink your pro-life status. It's okay to be pro-life for yourself. But the official pro-life status tries to making abortion illegal for everybody. It's making a choice for everybody that not everyone believes in. Be Pro-Choice. Let women decide when they're ready to raise a child. They know when they'll best be able to care and raise and love and lavish attention upon a kid. It's when they're ready, which cannot be determined by anybody but themselves. Think of the children. 

Women deserve good health. Women deserve safe healthcare. Women deserve to choose when they will become mothers. Children deserve mothers that love and want the best for them. 

Won't you consider trusting women and fighting for choice instead? """,,False,,t5_2qh8d,False,,,True,t3_1e90qe,http://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1e90qe/a_message_to_the_prolife_crowd/,

Over the last four or so years I've taught about twenty or so women's self-defense classes, specifically aimed towards rape and kidnapping prevention. I've read a couple reddit posts recently in various subreddits that inspired me to come post here. 

I really just want to focus on two relatively small seeming things that actually matter a fair amount- texting while walking and being embarrassed.  

So the post I read today that actually inspired this was about a teenage girl walking to 7-11 at three in the morning, saw some sketchy looking guys, and *immediately pulled her phone out and acted like she was texting*.  I know its a natural reaction to try to avoid making eye contact, to make it look like you're doing something, but all you're doing is showing the random guys that you're not paying attention to your surroundings! The same goes for acting like you're on the phone (or being on the phone).  You're distracted and can't pay as good attention to your surroundings. My sister always wanted me to talk to her on the phone while she was walking to her car after work at night, and this can be a good thing, but there are much safer ways to do something like that.  

My second point is about embarrassment.  We're all afraid of looking stupid or making someone else feel bad, it's just human nature. *However* it's much more important to be safe and alive than worry about being embarrassed. If you see something that looks wrong or if you're worried about embarrassing someone that might be wanting to harm you, stop.  Your voice is one of your most important weapons- if there's some guy following you through a mall, and you turn around, look directly at him, and yell ""Stop following me!"" or something along those lines, he will. Yeah, maybe it's some guy who's just walking in the same direction as you for a long time, but honestly it's much better to be safe than sorry.

Some other tips:

-Get pepper spray and put it on your keys.  If you're in trouble, you have a weapon that can save your life.  Get your concealed carry license too, if you can.  Being prepared is not being paranoid.

-If you're in a situation where you feel threatened, don't call your best friend. Call the police.  Get rid of the extra link in the chain.

-Watch your surroundings.  Walking and texting generally will make you look unprepared and unaware.  Walk with your eyes up and be aware.  You'll be much safer.

-Take a self defense class if you can! The ones I've done were all either free of charge or an entry fee of $20 that was immediately donated to our local women's shelter.  Arm yourself with knowledge.


I don't know if is this is the right place for this, so mods if it isn't I apologize.  PM me or comment if you have questions, I won't get any karma from posting this so please try to make this public.  I think your safety is incredibly important.

However, some reason I feel that your advice is could be more constrictive. I am straight (but not narrow, I have gay friends). I am 25 , did few Ironman triathlons. Therefore, I am not in too bad of a shape.

It all started few weeks ago when I started the program that I am in. This program has one openly gay man (as far as I know, he talks about it all the time). Few weeks ago he made a sexual remark to me that I really don't remember. As an easy going person my natural tendency was simply let that one go. 

Fast forward few weeks: sexual comments are starting to flow out of his mouth like water. It is starting to become really awkward being around him because we have the same schedule. We walk with bunch of other men into the locker room to change into scrubs. Every time he is just eye fucking the hell out of me. From time to time he makes a sexual remarks. For some odd reason the other men find it funny when he talks to me this way. Most of the time they would laugh. It's obvious that I am very uncomfortable.

Last week I deiced that I had enough of that. I told him something along the lines of : ""I am flattered that you find me attractive, but  I am straight and I would appreciate if you could stop making these remarks to me"". 

The weekend was long and dandy. Weather was great got to ride my bicycle a lot. When I stepped into the locker room with all the guys. He said again: "" So, are you getting naked for me? Am I going to be the lucky one to touch your lump?"" Me &lt;disgusted look, walking away&gt;: "" See you later""

It is starting to become frustrating. Should I report him to the dean of the program? Would it even be taken seriously? 

Or what you do?

Why are we letting these politicians openly debate our bodies? Why is it okay for them to tell us what we can and can't do with our bodies? I mean it feels as if my body is being violated even listening to them talk about how I shouldn't be allowed to decide what to do with it!


One politician even questions that women don't know what rape is, 
""Idaho state Sen. Chuck Winder (R) recently justified his opposition to abortion in cases of rape by questioning whether women really know what rape is.

""I would hope that when a woman goes in to a physician with a rape issue, that physician will indeed ask her about perhaps her marriage, was this pregnancy caused by normal relations in a marriage or was it truly caused by a rape,"" ""


If this man is elected, there's a possibility that we're going to take a step back in time to where our husbands can openly rape us and we have no say, because we will belong to them.

1345762118.0,40,self.women,ypzt8,Any woman out there who had to do everything on her own? No rich parents or supporting family? I will tell my story - would like to hear yours also,midnightsoldier,52,12,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/ypzt8/any_woman_out_there_who_had_to_do_everything_on/,"So ladies of reddit here we go.

Lately I have been feeling pretty tired and sometimes even frustrated. I am a young lady (26) who has needed to do everything on her own all her life. I've lost my father at an early age, and my mom was in depresion for many years, my brothers married young and moved away. 

noone really cared enough as to help me with anything. ever. neither would nobody be happy or glad or congratulate me whenever I would achieve something. 
I have been working since I was 15 and making my own money. (not so much but still something). Now I have graduated, I work my ass off to be able to care for my mom at least, and I cannot save anything at all, but still I feel like I am not doing anything. I mean - I have always had nice jobs, I graduated with honor merits, was well-behaved, in a relationship with a nice guy, have very few friends but nice ones - but whenever we gather with friends and talk about things I start feeling bad about myself. Because I see that all my other friends have benefits from their parents, I mean we go through conversations like ""ohh my dad bought me this car, and we just moved to this great house, or we're all going together in vacation"" and stuff like these.

stuff like these make me want a normal family and realize that as much as I work I will never be able to get what I want. and that's just sad. whenever I think about it I become sad.  So I try to avoid thinking about it. but in cases like this when we gather with friends and talk about this stuff - I always start wondering about my life.

I also feel tired having to do EVERYTHING on my own. I know I am a strong independent woman and I thank God for that, but it's normal to want to have some support sometimes right?

Have you ever felt this way ladies? I would like to hear your stories. Maybe they will make me feel better.

Thank you

EDIT: Ladies I feel amazed by all your posts and reactions. I feel really bad for some of the experiences I read and I wish for all of us to find our way in this crazy world. Thank you for all your nice words. It's nice to know that out there - there are other wonderful ladies who have made it on their own and are doing good.

The thing that bothers me the most is that sometimes from all the thoughts I have about everyone else getting everything so easily - I feel like I am sometimes jelaous and a bad person. I don't like myself in those cases.

In the past couple years I went  to my grandmother's home (2 hours away) every week for one, two, or three days.  I cooked, cleaned, helped with laundry, doctor's appointments, whatever my grandmother needed.

My grandfather's 40 year old son (remember they're divorced so the son is not my grandmother's son) took care of his needs.  The son played in a band on Friday and Saturday nights but was otherwise unemployed.  This son was born of the teenage girl my grandfather got pregnant and divorced my grandmother over.

My 70 year old father is grandmother's only child.  He came to visit her a couple times a week but always seemed cranky and unfriendly so I just ignored him.

Over the past two years I heard my grandfather constantly curse my father but praise his 40 year old son.  He did it so much that it seemed like his hobby.  He said my father was worthless, only wanted my grandmother's money, and we should be careful around him, he was not to be trusted.  But he said that his 40 year old son was the only person he and my grandmother should trust.  He is a ""good boy"" he said over and over.

About a year ago I noticed grandmother was getting disconnect notices coming in the mail and I asked her if I could help her go through the bills.  She was grateful, but my grandfather and his 40 year old son started acting weird, they seemed suspicious of me and both became increasingly hostile.

I was becoming very concerned that my grandfather also started yelling at my grandmother, cursing at her, throwing things, calling her a wrinkled up ugly old woman, and turning the tv volume up full blast.  I called the 40 year old son to ask for his help but he wouldn't call me back.  

Shortly after that my grandmother's certified nursing aide called me and quit without notice.  She said the 40 year old son had told her she was not to allow me to spend time one-on-one with grandmother, that she should not call me concerning my grandmother's health, even though I had become her legally empowered health care power of attorney.  The son told the aide that he planned to see to it that neither my father nor I had anything to do with my grandmother's care.

That's when I started putting pieces together that I previously felt were odd but wanted to believe were innocent.

There had been a change of beneficiary form for one of grandmother's $85,000 investment accounts that would have made her ex-husband the new beneficiary... and of course his only beneficiary is his unemployed 40 year old son.

I discovered that the 40 year old son had had his father's nursing home expenses billed directly to my grandmother.

I also came to the realization that in the year that I had helped grandmother pay bills, not once had her ex-husband or his son pitched in a single penny for groceries or any household expenses, nor contributed with the expense of the nursing aides who had recently been hired to take more care of my grandfather than my grandmother.

Grandfather has always talked a lot about money, he has told me repeatedly in the past two years that he wouldn't be leaving anything for me in his will but my grandmother would.  I really hated it when he talked about it, I love my grandmother dearly, and didn't care about her money only her happiness.

Besides not paying her bills, I noticed that grandmother more and more often lapsed into periods of nonsense, such as telling me that a man came out of her closet and brought her an angel.  She held her head and shrank into her chair for hours while her ex-husband yelled and cursed and blasted the tv all day long.

I hired a lawyer and petitioned the court for a guardian for her.  I have spent all of my short term savings and have only a small amount of retirement savings left.  We made my 70 year old father the temp guardian.  Now the 40 year old unemployed son has hired a team of lawyers.

Here's where I need help because I am becoming despondent.  The 40 year old son is very, very handsome and charming.  He has lined up a dozen or more ""witnesses"" who I think are calling the Judge and making me into the bad guy.  He is a singer in a band, makes only gas money according to his own claims, but the young women love him and melt at his feet.  All of the home aides are young females who now scowl at me like I'm evil.

I am 50 and look like it.  I am tired from all the caregiving and worry, plus I work full time besides.  

I am terrified that the 40 year old son is making me look like the bad guy.  The judge actually pointed at me during one of the hearings and said ""I will make the decision about what is best for (my grandmother)... not (my name).""  Why would the judge say that about me?

This guy planned to cut my dad and me out of my grandmother's life... he and my grandfather were beginning to clean out her life savings by having her pay all of grandfather's bills.  Note that my grandmother refused to remarry him and has not given either of them legal access to her decision-making or money.  

My grandmother has been the most important and loving and supportive family member to me and I couldn't bare to see her hold her head for hours and seem so unhappy.

BTW the court-ordered psychologist found she is completely unable to make decisions and is out of touch with reality and needs to be protected.

I'm so scared.  I can't sleep at night out of fear that this handsome singer, who I fear is a charming con-man , will win and take my grandmother away from me and make me out to be the bad guy.

1252288246.0,37,self.women,9hyj8,A message from the mods of r/Women,,83,46,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/9hyj8/a_message_from_the_mods_of_rwomen/,"Collectively, as mods of r/women, we have decided to take some positive steps to deal with the trolling and abusive comments in this subreddit. A goal of r/women is to promote a safer space for both women and men to post and discuss women's issues. Unfortunately, it has come to our attention that some of our regular subscribers are uncomfortable contributing to the discourse here because of the abuse and vitriol that sometimes are found in r/women.

As a result, we have taken steps to ban some users and institute a policy of banning any users who are trolling or are being abusive. This does not mean that we will banning people that disagree with the opinions of the mods and in fact, we encourage dissenting opinions as we are only able to learn by understanding and engaging in debate for controversial issues. As such, in an effort to better represent the subscribers of this subreddit as a whole, we will be removing those persons who insist on commenting in r/women solely for the purpose of disrupting the subreddit with vitriol to make others feel uncomfortable.

In an effort to address the “free speech” arguments that may occur, please be aware of the following:

- Each subreddit has the right to make its own policies within the greater user agreement of Reddit as a whole. In the exercise of that discretion, we feel it is more important to encourage and maintain our regular subscribers than the potential backlash of removing those whose sole intent is abusing the regular members of r/women; 

- the policy of banning disrupting users as a whole is not up for debate; however, in the unlikely event that a user is banned unfairly in error, we invite you to PM one of the mods and we will discuss the issue;

- It is our aim to create a safer space here in r/women. The only way to do that is to ensure that those who seek to disrupt this space because of their own negative views of women's issues, do not succeed in their aims by driving regular members away; and

- It is not our intent to create any kind of echo chamber but the severity of the trolls have left us no choice to remove their voices so that the voices of those who are actually concerned with 
women's issues are able to have productive discussions.

We anticipate a backlash from those extremists who have been banned and/or their small group of supporters. They will use the argument that we are restricting speech and therefore can never have a productive discussion re: women's issues because we suppress debate. This is a dishonest tactic and a red herring to deflect attention away from the real intent of the trolls which is remove all safe spaces for interested parties to discuss women's issues on reddit and is due to their own personal negative views towards women. Luckily, these people are few and far between. Unfortunately, they are the loudest voices on Reddit.

We will likely see a cross-post to Men's Rights or some other subreddit and an encouragement to downvote all submissions and comments here. This is another tactic that's used in an effort to scare away contributers. Fortunately, as with most trolls, they will move on after a couple of days.

We look forward to the new improved r/Women and welcome the engaging discussions that this subreddit is known for.
