It wasn't even coffee, it was hot chocolate in a starbucks cup, but that's not the point and it made for some amazing trolling material. 

Scene: elevator going up 20 floors, super preggo me, a guy delivering mail, and lawyer-bitch who shall be referred to as Judgey McJudgerson from this point on. 

Judgey McJudgerson: (glaring at my coffee cup) ""Do you think you should be having that?"" 

Me: ""What? This? Yes, I do actually. Do you think you should be telling me what to put into my body?""

Mail guy: *uncomfortable silence*

Judgey McJudgerson: ""Well, you know that it's not just your body anymore, right? The baby absorbs everything you eat and caffeine can be really harmful for it."" 

Me: ""....baby? What baby?""

Judgey McJudgerson: ""Oh my god, I'm so sorry, I thought... *stammer stutter, hilarious apologies*""

Me: ""No, I'm kidding, I'm pregnant. I figured that since you're obviously a doctor who is an expert in prenatal care, you would figure that out.""

Mail guy: *starts to chuckle*

Judgey McJudgerson: ""I'm a lawyer, not a doctor.""

Me: ""I don't care. Don't tell me what to do with my body and I won't tell you what to do with yours. Just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean that people are allowed to pass judgement on my choices.""

Elevator doors go *DING* and I get to sweep out with a self righteous air of injured dignity. It was glorious, until I realized that I was lost and had to sheepishly go back to the desk outside the elevator and ask for directions. Fortunately Judgey McJudgerson was nowhere to be seen. I would like to thank all you bumpers for preparing me so marvelously for this occasion! It's easy to think on your feet when you've been reading rants for the last 30 weeks.

We happen to be just the same size, so everything fit perfectly!

My husband and I had our first son together when we were 17. We've done well taking care of ourselves since then, but we definitely live paycheck to paycheck. We just got married in September at the age of 22 and have been talking about having another child for about a year now. We kept feeling like we wanted our son to have a sibling and didn't want them to be far apart in age, but weren't sure how well things would work out financially. I spent lots of time running numbers and trying to find solutions, and it seemed do-able. We got pregnant in November and since then things just keep seemingly smacking us in the face, financially. My husband's car died, had to spend our entire savings account buying a new one. 2 weeks after that, my car started overheating, had to pay another $1000+ getting that fixed. We have all the necessary baby items, but have been trying to save for my impending unpaid maternity leave + hospital bills, which together I calculate should cost about $5000+. 

My husband has had terrible luck with jobs and kept losing them and not being able to find new ones. We mostly rely on my salary and I've been so scared that when I'm out on maternity leave for 6 weeks, we won't have any money. 

My boss just called me into his office to tell me that he's decided to cover my maternity leave 100%. He said he wants me to be able to enjoy my maternity leave and the new baby without having to worry about being unpaid for 6 weeks. 

I'm in shock. I don't know if I did anything more than nod and say thank you a hundred times to him, I just can't believe it. I love my job and I love my boss and I'm never leaving here, ever.

Getting the coffee triggered the memory of me meeting my sister-in-law for the first time. Well, officially in person. I met my husband on the opposite coast of his family and even though we had known each other for years, I never met his family.

Okay, okay... Back to the memory. When we show up, I'm basically a stranger seven months pregnant by her brother. She's about a year older than me and has three kids. All of her pregnancies weren't easy ones. As soon as she found out I was pregnant she sent me various care packages and called me every time I had a weepy facebook status. First thing she asked was if I wanted, ""Coffee or anything"" (as any great host would) I remember being openly surprised she offered me coffee.

""Isn't coffee terrible for the baby?"" I asked.

""I've spent roughly the last six years either trying to get pregnant, being pregnant or breastfeeding. Give yourself a break on the little things. If Crackhead Sally can have a well, almost perfectly healthy baby then you can manage a coffee or two. Stress is worse on the baby than a small taste of wine or a cup of coffee after you've had a rough day. You're doing an awesome job. I'm proud of how well you're handling being pregnant. I'm on your side."" She gave me a smile and I could tell she meant every word. 

I revisit that memory often. I still do... Obviously. At that moment she was like any of you. We had mainly spoken online or over the phone. I have no family in the state we live in. I think of you ladies often. Even the new ones I never had a chance to meet. :)

If you're here, you care about your pregnancy or impending pregnancy... Or the pregnancy you hoped for that didn't quite end the way you wanted. 

You all are amazing!!! You are glowy beautiful on days you feel like a beached whale. You are doing a wonderful job on days you feel guilty you ate that whole bag of Oreos. You deserve that entire day in bed because your head is spinning and the nausea is just too much.

You. Are. Glorious.

Don't let anyone tell you different. :)

Edit: You ladies are AMAZING!!! You say I lifted your spirits but you guys have truly made me feel special!

1367938934.0,257,self.BabyBumps,1dv4xs,My thoughts about personal safety on a public forum such as Reddit,not_really_a_nerd,290,33,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1dv4xs/my_thoughts_about_personal_safety_on_a_public/,"Hey ladies! So, I absolutely love Baby Bumps and love coming here with questions and for support. I don’t know how I would handle pregnancy without each and every one of you! I think it's great that we are a tight community that is generally accepting and friendly. I do, however, have some safety concerns. 

This is the Internet. Everything you post is public, and can be seen by *anyone* who wants to see it. Now, generally that’s not a big deal—who really cares if you have hemorrhoids or if you successfully brushed your teeth this morning? I mean, nobody is really going to use that against you. However, I have seen lots of people post ultrasound pictures with their full names, then on their user profile you can see other posts saying where they live and how old they are, sometimes along with photos of them, their SO, and their new little one. Ladies, this isn’t Facebook. You might feel like you know people on here, but there are nearly 8000 people on this subreddit, not to mention it is public and anyone can view it, whether they subscribe or not. I just wanted to make you guys aware how dangerous it can be to give out this information. 

For instance, think of common security questions. What is your mother’s name? What city were you born in? Where did you grow up? If you give your child’s full name, birth date, and your other posts have info regarding your city, your age, and so on, it would be really easy for someone to steal your child’s identity. Social Security numbers are partially created from this personal information such as your city/zip code. I don’t want to cause fear, but I honestly think some people don’t realize the risk behind sharing such personal details on the Internet. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve been able to find on Facebook just from what I’ve seen them post on Baby Bumps.  If it's easy to get to your FB, imagine all the personal info that is posted there, especially if you are so lenient with what you post on Reddit. One person I found even had their address and phone number publicly posted on their FB page. Luckily I’m not an identity thief, but someone who is can get a lot of info about you from what you post. Please be aware and be cautious!

Edit: As evidenced by the people who are commenting in this thread, and don't even subscribe to Baby Bumps (they saw this post in /r/all), please know that anyone can see this stuff, not just Bumpers! Also, what you post on the Internet is permanent, and hitting ""delete"" doesn't make it go away. Deleting old posts can somewhat get rid of personal information (or at least make it harder to find), but it still exists in cyber space somewhere.

TLDR; This in the Internet. Even though this feels like a tight community, be aware the Internet is public and what you post can be seen by anyone, anywhere in the world. Be smart about posting personally identifiable information! :)",Tip!,False,self,t5_2s7cl,1367946618.0,help,,True,t3_1dv4xs,http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1dv4xs/my_thoughts_about_personal_safety_on_a_public/,

I stumbled upon this subreddit today and had to stop and marvel at the amount of information, stories, and advice here. As the title says I am a transwoman (that is, Male to female), and as such, there is currently no amount of science, surgery, or money that could enable me to become pregnant. For me this is very, very depressing. Even if they were somehow able to equip me for it, I still now and always will have a mismatched pair of chromosomes. The one thing I have wanted  with absolute certainty in my life is to be a mother and to carry my own children. I want a daughter, maybe two. I have names picked out.

 I have nights where it's all I can do to not bawl my eyes out. I love to listen to to the stories and experiences of anyone, anyone at all who I meet who isn't shy to talk about their baby bump and the frothing hormonal hurricane therein. I find myself wishing I had a pregnant friend, someone who would share everything with me. It would bring me great joy to one day have a pregnant wife/girlfriend (and yes, in terms of gender identity and sexuality, I am a lesbian, which brings to the table it's own complications in the area of baby making.) But alas, I have no one who meets both the criteria of A. knowing what I am going through and B. being pregnant. So, I find this subreddit to be a form of bittersweet refuge - endlessly comforting, infinitely heartbreaking.

Suffice it to say, thank you all for sharing your experiences here. I look forward to reading every story and experience I can find. It means more to me than most of you could possibly understand, and is the only sip of water I have to quench the thirst of an insatiable longing. 

EDIT: If you have any questions feel free to ask - I'd be happy to answer.

I had my first ultrasound yesterday at an estimated 8 weeks and 4 days. The thing that was first and foremost in my mind was seeing a healthy heartbeat, and both my husband and I were so happy when the baby came into view and we could see its heart fluttering away. As I looked at the screen, I caught myself crying a little (out of happiness, relief, so on and so forth), but my tears stopped when the nurse practitioner shifted the wand and another baby came into view. 

""You have twins!"" she announced. I don't remember my exact reaction, but I do recall not believing her immediately. Twins. Suuuuure. My husband didn't believe her either. He scoffed and said something along the lines of, ""Next you'll say there are triplets in there."" And she moves the wand again, then says, ""It's funny you mention it. Here's baby number three.""

Nothing coherent came out of my mouth for the next few hours. I'd thought that maybe... *maybe* the odds were in my favor to have twins at some point because my grandmother had two sets, but triplets had never crossed my mind. My NP was able to determine through the US that there was an identical set with one placenta, and then another baby off to itself with its own placenta. Definitely triplets. 

I was sent down for blood work and a second ultrasound. The former I'd expected, the latter was because there was some suspicion the identical twins were sharing the same membrane and yolk sac. It turned out that there were in fact two membranes and two yolk sacs and three healthy heart rates (170-180 for them all) and three moving babies.  

There was also an ovary with what looked like two separate compartments and bloodflow running through it oddly. The tech kindly explained how it all worked, but I was incapable of processing anything beyond: I apparently have always had a high chance of fraternal twins all along, since more than one egg can come from that particular ovary, but this time one of the fertilized eggs split on the way down! 

My husband and I are still in shock, but we've acknowledged that we've a big, unique family in the making. We're taking one day at a time and trying not to think too far into the future. When we do that, we start panicking. What do you mean, we'll have three 16 year olds wanting a car at the same time? o.o

Behold the following conversation:

Her: Dear, you know you aren't supposed to drink coffee while pregnant, right?

Me: Wow, congratulations!

Her: Excuse me?

Me: I didn't know you were an MD now! When did you graduate?

Her: *Confused look*

Me: I assume that since my Dr. told me two cups of coffee per day was perfectly healthy, the school must be teaching new information she hasn't heard about yet.

We met with NICU doctors and talked about the possibility of having a baby born at 28 weeks. It was so scary.

Then 2 days ago at 32 weeks we had another ultrasound. My uterus had stretched in a way to pull the placenta completely away from the cervix. It is now more than 2cm away.

* Your milk will take anywhere from 3-10 days to come in. The baby's tummy is the size of a marble, and it will feed frequently. The colostrum you're producing is more than enough, and the absolute best thing you can give your child. During this time, focus on getting a good latch and figuring out what positions may work best for you.

* Anyone who says it won't hurt is lying, especially for a first timer. Bleeding, cracked nipples definitely indicate that something is wrong, but soreness is normal. You're having someone suck on your boobs for up to a few hours at a time, which most people don't have happen. Yeah, it's going to hurt, but after 10 days/2 weeks or so, it does get better. Letdown stings in the beginning, but you will get used to it. Just breath through it, and keep on keeping on.

* ASK FOR HELP!!!! Find a good online community, find a mother's group, find a la leche league group, subreddit, or hell, PM me. There IS support out there, so take full advantage of it. 

* Know that there are 2 kinds of breastmilk: foremilk and hindmilk. Foremilk is thin and watery and comes out first, and it satisfies the baby's thirst. Hindmilk comes out after, and it can be compared to heavy cream. That's the super caloric part of the milk, the part your baby will use most to grow. If you pump and put it in the fridge, the milk will separate. Totally normal. Just swirl (don't shake) it around and it will mix back together. Don't microwave it either, run the bag/bottle under warm water to warm it back up. 

* Pumping is not how you tell if you're producing enough milk. The best way to tell is by looking at your baby. Is it gaining weight and growing? Does it have 6-8 wet diapers, and 1-2 poopy diapers a day? Then yes, you have enough milk. Even if it feels like the baby is eating ALL.THE.TIME, if those things are true, your baby is getting enough. Also, don't freak out if your baby starts to poop less as it ages. Around 6 weeks (for us) my son went from 2-3 poopy diapers/day to 1/week. It's normal for an EBF (exclusively breastfed baby) to go 10 days without pooping, because there just isn't a lot of waste from digesting breastmilk, so it can take awhile to build up.

* Know that there is actually a WHO growth chart specifically for breastfed babies. You can google it, it's easy to find. The charts in most dr's offices include both formula fed and breastfed babies, so your baby may be on a different place in the chart. While I'm not a dr, as long as my child is meeting developmental milestones and is growing consistently on it's own curve, I don't really care what the other chart says.

* [kellymom.com](http://www.kellymom.com) Like it, learn it, live it. Saved my butt many times.

* If you've tried everything and it's just not working, just feed your baby. There are orgs out there that will help you get donated breastmilk if you want, or just use formula. The bottom line is, that baby needs to eat, and compared to what they used to feed babies (beer and soggy bread? really?), formula is a serious upgrade. **You did your best, now feed your baby and be at peace.**

Sorry about the soap box, but there is just so much misinformation out there, including stuff coming from ""healthcare professionals."" It makes my heart hurt to hear about a mom who is 1 day pp and the nurses force formula because her milk hasn't come in. DUH!!!!!!!!! It's not supposed to yet!!! *twitch* edit: formatting",,False,self,t5_2s7cl,False,,GIRL,True,t3_1fv8x5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1fv8x5/after_reading_comments_on_the_front_page_on_a/,

This isn't the pink discharge or spotting I've had for days but outright large amount of plug complete with blood. 

This preceded the actual birth by 8 1/2 and 12 hours my last two babies.

I'm going to keep your guesses over at expectnet but lower the weight actual birth date has (enough to separate two people getting gender/length/weight right without making you too wrong for having the wrong date/time due to my induction scare yesterday.)

[Enter your guess if you haven't already.](http://www.expectnet.com/games/RoBeWeird)

Make your name your reddit username

The winner gets reddit gold and/or artwork from me once I'm back on my own computer post-birth (I'll be on hubbys a while, since it's a pain to transfer mine with my wacom and everything)

Ladies, I am SO excited right now.

**Update 1**: Getting contractions... real ""electric"" ones but not very often yet. Not time to call the midwife or hubby home from work. 

If baby is born today our family birth dates will be 4th, 14th, 24th... and 26th, 27th, 28th... if tomorrow, 4th, 14th... 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th. Pretty neat huh?

As things ramp up, you may start getting updates in comments from SergeantJinto... that's my hubby :)

**Update 2**: Moving along steadily. But this is just how I do it. It'll probably still be several hours until I get to the really tough stuff. For now, just cleaning up my house and relaxing. Haven't even called hubby home but both he and midwife are aware that baby time is approaching.

**Update 3**: Asked hubby to finish up what he needs to do at work at come home. The contractions are getting very uncomfortable and by the time he gets here I'll need his support through them if they keep progressing like this.

**Update 4**: Hubby is home. Family has been notified. Midwife is still waiting for our call (not quite time yet) and babysitter and photographer are both on stand-by now. Contractions are something like 10 minutes apart and fairly long. I'm to a point I hit every pregnancy where during a contraction, I KNOW I am in labor. But in between I start to question if maybe I'm not just jumping the gun (because it takes so long in between contractions). This is a good sign. I think big kiddos will be sent to the babysitter before terribly long, I'm becoming much less able to speak through contractions now.

To pass time, we are making the house more museum ready so hubby doesn't have as much to do while I'm in bed with the babe for the next few days.

**Update 5**: Just fixed sticky at top of page.

Good timing, I almost can't type through the contractions now and they're starting to get closer together.

**Update 6**: 8 hours in. Still early labor. Needs to hurry up and progress.

**Update 7**: Okay getting stronger, moaning and trying to relax through the harder ones. Sent the kids to the babysitters to sleep and will be calling the midwife before long.

**Update 8**: SergeantJinto here (hubby :D). Midwife is on the way, Mae is moaning to the music through the contractions and claiming it helps (I believe her). She thinks baby time is only a few hours away!

**Update 9**: Hubby here again. Midwife is here, 4-5 cm dilated, 80% effaced, 0 to -1 station, bulging bag of waters @ 11:00 PM EST. WOOOOOO!

**Update 10**: 12:25 AM EST - Hubby again (As if you expected any different at this point?) Midwife's doulas are here now, along with a friend of ours to take pictures of the laboring and birth for us. Contractions are still getting stronger and faster.

**update the last** birth announcement coming soon. I'm exhausted, starving and sore but baby is so awesome!",,False,self,t5_2s7cl,1343210056.0,,purple,True,t3_x2l1r,http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/x2l1r/this_deserves_its_own_post_i_got_strawberry/,

So I never planned to get pregnant, nor did I think I could get pregnant, considering the fact that I was on the pill (and have been for 3 years, due to extremely painful and heavy periods). 

Apart from this, I had an ectopic pregnancy 4 years ago, which went unnoticed, and finally erupted inside me. I had one fallopian tube and an ovary removed. My doctor told me it was still possible to get pregnant but there would need to be lots of planning involved.

About a year later, I was found to have a big cyst on my remaining ovary, of which they removed half. SO, I was left with one fallopian tube and half an ovary. I resigned myself to the fact that I wouldn't be having kids.

Fast forward to today and I sit here, 11 weeks pregnant, sharing my story with you lovely ladies and I'm so happy to be in this position. I can't help but think nature's trying to tell me something with this little one inside me.

TL;DR Got pregnant while on the pill, and with only one fallopian tube and half an ovary.",,False,self,t5_2s7cl,False,,BOY,True,t3_14yia2,http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/14yia2/i_cant_believe_im_pregnant_really_its_crazy/,

Then I learned that I would need another ultrasound the next day, so I quickly invited him along.

It was the sweetest thing ever to witness. He was in such awe at being able to see his grandchild in the womb, all the organs and the clearly visible spine and the beating heart. He got so emotional and actually cried a little.

This weekend my husband and I are watching TV and I ask him to help me up out of the chair so I can use the bathroom. He happily obliges, gets up and grabs my hands to help me up. Instead of pulling me up he pulls halfway and then gives me a kiss and drops me back in the chair. I laugh, he's being sweet. He's still holding my hands and pulls me halfway up again, kisses me and drops me in the chair. Again I laugh but this time I say ""ok you are cute but I need to go to the bathroom and we don't want me peeing on our nice furniture. So he pulls me up on my feet and I start to walk to the bathroom. I'm not really paying attention and as I'm walking he slips past me and into the bathroom. I walk after him laughing and he is clearly trying to block me from the toilet. I'm still laughing which as this point is not good. I barely get out ""you need to move!"" and the I start to wet my pants. As a last minute ditch effort to salvage some dignity (or maybe just my pants) I pull my pants down and flop down on the edge of the bathtub and finish peeing in there. My husband is shocked!!! I'm shocked! I'm laughing uncontrollably and he starts laughing too. But as I'm in the middle of this hysterical laughter I am suddenly embarrassed about what has just happened and I begin to sob. Now I'm crying as uncontrollably as I was laughing 10 seconds ago. My husband was so scared! He starts apologizing and hugging me as I'm sitting on the edge of the bathtub, pants around my ankles, crying and crying and crying. WTF?!!

I was pro life before I became pregnant. Now, I'm sure that people are wondering how that happened, usually the switch goes the other way, right? Not for me. Because when I was sitting in my dorm room, holding onto a stick that I had pissed on with two little pink lines staring back up at me, my life changed. I have school to finish, I'm only halfway done. I have things to do. I'm 20 years old. A million things flashed through my head.

And I'll tell you right now, I considered all 3 options. Heavily, for weeks. And I am so thankful that I was able to come to my decision on MY TERMS. Obviously, I chose to keep him. But that was my choice to make, not anyone else's.

Before I became pregnant I would think to myself ""how could anyone want to ""get rid"" of their baby?"" and the minute I was looking at that test, I realized how they could. 

So bottom line is, until you are in the position to make a choice like that, you have no clue. And I'll tell you who will never be in that position

dudes.

Labor was rough, and not what I expected, but I made it, and it was absolutely beautiful. There are a few things that happened during and after the process that I wasn't really expecting, though. And I'd like to share those with you. These things aren't the same for everyone, and I can't say with all certainty that any or all of these things will be at all applicable to you, but I'd like to share them anyway. Just, you know, in case and stuff =)  




1. How **long** it is!  
I knew that labor lasts a while, and was mentally prepared for 24 hours or so of progressing labor. What I wasn't prepared for, ironically, is the *labor* that goes into labor! I was in true, active, consistent labor from 8:30 in the morning on Thursday through 5:44 in the morning on Saturday. It was laborious, it was straining, and it was absolutely exhausting. Things are progressive, and your pain threshold does increase with every growing contraction, but there's never really a point that it's easy. Labor is laborious!  

2. Modest is hottest, except when you're in labor.  
Seriously. All my plans about bringing my own gown, using the tub with a sports bra on, and hiding my boobies from my doctor went out the window. When you're in that degree of pain and purpose, it just doesn't matter. Giving birth for me was a very instinctual, almost animalistic experience. What mattered was getting through the pain and getting the baby out. I farted. I pooped. I pulled my hair back into a super-tight ponytail with sweaty chunks of hair popping out everywhere. I sweat, I bled, and I ultimately had a baby. When it was all said and done, the only part that mattered was the last part. I don't look back with any embarrassment or regret, because everything that happened is what is supposed to happen during labor.  

3. Recovery time is so necessary.  
After a full day of labor, I was exhausted. But I couldn't sleep for any substantial period of time, because I had to breastfeed every few hours. I've been bleeding through 3 or 4 giant maxi pads a day, and nursing a ""very small"" peri-urethral tear, so every time I need to use the restroom, it's a giant mess and quite a bit of pain. For the first 8 hours or so after labor, I couldn't remember how to pee. After so much pushing and trauma, my muscles were out of whack and I forgot how to access the one that let me pee. I eventually figured it out, and am doing fine now, but it just goes to show how difficult it can be to readjust to the simplest parts of your body after labor. I was lucky enough to be able to quit my job and live solely off of my fiance's income, but no matter your situation, try to take as much time to yourself as possible afterward. You won't just need it to get your bearings back, there's legit healing that needs to take place.  

4. How quickly certain things reset in your body.  
That horrendous rib pain I had my entire pregnancy from Eleanor slamming her feet up there? Gone immediately. My inability to take in a full breath of air because of my squished-up lungs? No more. My instant fullness after 2 bites of full because nothing fit in my stomach? Definitely not a problem! So many of the things that had become such a normal inconvenience for me through the last 9 months of my life were instantly dealt with. Sure, like I said, there is quite a bit of new recovery to take place, but there's also a lot that returns to almost normal quite quickly. My uterus shrank up really quickly, and is now starting to look almost not pregnant at all, and the skin around my belly and hips is not nearly as ""goopy"" as I was anticipating... and has already started to regain its form! Sure, it may be partly a vanity thing, but it's also just really nice to see that my body knows what it's doing, and is so quickly recovering from such a huge change.  

5. It's totally okay to over-prepare.  
Have a snoogle? Bring it. Laptop? Take it with you. Favorite teddy? Go for it. Sure, a lot of it you may not end up needing, but if you do, you'll be glad you have it. We ended up staying in the hospital for an extra day after delivery due to wonky kidney function levels, and it would've been nice to have something to make it feel a bit more homey  and comfortable. We've always been the ""less is more"" type couple, but less body wash is only more gross. Seriously, don't be afraid of being over-prepared. It's much better than being under-prepared!  


Basically, labor and delivery is CRAZY, and until you experience it, nothing can truly prepare you for everything that comes with it. But you can do it. You can, and you will. This subreddit has been so helpful in preparing me for childbirth and early motherhood, and it's been amazing to share this experience with you ladies. If there's any sort of light I can shine for you on any subject, let me know. I'm happy to offer any insight I can based off of my own personal experience. Your labor will be different from mine, and everyone else's,  but again, you **can** do it!",,False,self,t5_2s7cl,False,,GIRL,True,t3_1e6xkb,http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1e6xkb/things_that_surprised_me_about_labor/,

I haven't really been ready to talk about this until now, and it all happened so quickly.  I need some good thoughts and well-wishes, so I'm putting it out there. 

My twins have been diagnosed with twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, which is basically the scariest thing that can happen during a twin pregnancy.  In a nutshell, they aren't sharing the placenta equally.  Left untreated, it is nearly 100% fatal for both twins.

Luckily, it doesn't have to be left untreated.  There are now several places in the country that can perform a laser surgery to separate the joined blood vessels,  which can improve survival rates dramatically.  I'm headed to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia tonight to be evaluated for the surgery tomorrow. 

The evaluation will be grueling (a three-hour ultrasound, echocardiograms on both babies, possible amniocentesis).  If I'm deemed a candidate, I'll probably be headed in for surgery ASAP.  

I have so many fears about this, one of them being that we are told that they'll die without the surgery but I'm not a candidate for some reason.  I'm scared we'll get there and it will already be too late for one or both of them.  I'm scared they won't make it through the surgery.  I'm scared we'll be told that selective reduction is the only way to save one of the girls.  

Please be thinking of my husband and me tonight and tomorrow.  I am not religious, but if any of you are, I will not turn down a prayer.  I'll take whatever help I can get.

Edit:  Thank you all so much for your support.  I'm trying to remain calm. I think if the only time my babies get to spend on this earth is the 18 weeks I've had with them so far, then I want those 18 weeks to have been serene and peaceful.   BUT, I'm still hoping to bring home 2 healthy girls and will I fight for them until I have nothing left.

When I was pregnant and active on babybumps  I loved to read the birth stories and everything from the great beyond. I loved the wiggle worm in my tummy so much and I loved to feel him move around and flop. I was going to miss that so much after he was born, but I could not wait to meet him! I was induced on March 21, and everything went well, pushed through 3 contractions and he was here! All 22 inches and 6 pounds of him. And I felt... nothing. 

I confided to my husband as we were left alone in the birthing room to bond that I didn't feel anything. I don't know that I would jump in front of a moving bus for him, to reference a saying I hear a lot. He said you're just exhausted and overwhelmed and have a lot to take in. Eat something, get some sleep, and let's reassess in the morning. So, I didn't really eat anything, couldn't really sleep, but did send Mr. Man to the nursery so I could try to sleep! Woke up the next morning, and... nothing still. I had feelings, definitely, but not what you always hear about. I saw all the BB posts about ""don't worry ladies, everything you're going through is SO worth it"" and ""I have never loved anything more in my entire life"". I totally expected the same. I had those feelings when I was gestating him, what the hell happened?!

It wasn't until I embarrassingly confessed to a friend that I didn't have that feeling immediately. And I really didn't until about 8 weeks old. (this week mark keeps changing as I get further out and forget when things changed) Friend told me she was the same, and so were a lot of other people she talked to. 

So, this is NOT to be a Debbie Downer, it is to let you know that sometimes it is different on the outside. Not for everyone, and sometimes maybe for just a day or two. Others, like me, it took a couple of months. And now, that little boy is amazing. Don't feel like something is wrong! But now, as the mother of a 19 week old, I can tell you IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT! ;)

Edit: Just wanted to say that I love other people chiming in and sharing their same feelings! I hope it is reassurance for first time moms and dads who may go through this in the very near future!

1354742082.0,179,self.BabyBumps,14cdxl,The (very long) story of our loss at 21 weeks,aislinnanne,216,37,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/14cdxl/the_very_long_story_of_our_loss_at_21_weeks/,"I'd like to start this with a warning. This is an honest, heartfelt, and sad account of my recent loss. I will discuss details of both my emotions and the logistics of what brought my husband and I down this path. I discuss, in detail, my experience terminating my pregnancy late in my pregnancy. This may be hard for some to read. It may make some people angry. I am sharing this because I have been asked to by several people and because, though it took me over a week to write while I paused frequently to cry, I found the writing of it therapeutic. If you have anything hateful to say, feel free, but expect no response from me. I am at peace with our decision and eager to bring a healthy life into this world. If you feel this will trigger anything for you, please stop now. I wish no sadness or stress on anyone. Your pregnancy, your life, should be nothing short of joyful. 

As many of you may have read, my husband and I got some terrible news at our anatomy scan. In the initial scan they saw no movement in the fetus' limbs. His shoulder, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles appeared to be fused. They said it was similar to [arthrogryposis (also referred to as AMC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthrogryposis) but in reverse (most fetuses with AMC present with limbs in flexion, he was in full extension).

We decided to hold off on any decisions until we got a second opinion so they did an amnio and got us scheduled us another appointment. The following Monday we headed to another hospital and were told that it was definitely AMC and that it not only affected his limbs but also his spine and jaw. Basically every joint in his body was immobile. 

The doctors were very clear about what this meant. *If* he survived birth (which they weren't sure he could), he wouldn't have any kind of independent life. He may not even be able to breathe on his own. My husband and I finalized a decision we had, sadly, come to terms with earlier in the week-we would be terminating this pregnancy. 

Now to add insult to injury. Since there is a ban on federally funded abortions, my insurance (Tricare) wouldn't cover a dime of it. To have it done at the hospital would be $10k so we were obviously going to have to look elsewhere. Women's health services in MA said they could do it for $3200. Well, we thought, that's better than the hospital, so we booked an appointment. In the meantime, they suggested I contact the [Eastern Massachusetts Abortion Fund](http://emafund.org/). This organization is truly wonderful. If you know anyone in New England struggling to pay for an abortion, please refer them here. They suggested, if we were able, to look into going to NY to Parkmed. It was only $1250 and that is only a 4 hour drive. We cancelled at Women's Health and got in Friday at Parkmed.

Showing up at the clinic they did an ultrasound and dated me at 21 weeks by then. It would be a two day procedure. On day one they would insert laminaria to dilate my cervix overnight and give me a saline injection in the uterus to terminate fetal life. The first day I was then put under general anesthesia. When I woke, I was a mess. I knew I made the right decision but with the laminaria in my cervix and the band aid on my lower abdomen, I also knew that although the process wasn't complete, my little boy was gone. We would never meet the baby we spent over a year trying to conceive. 

After they were satisfied I could walk, I was allowed to eat a snack and have some ginger ale. They had me call my husband (he wasn't allowed to stay at the clinic because they don't have a lot of extra space and prohibit non patients from waiting) and we went back to our hotel. We did well most of the night but as we laid in bed, we both eventually broke down and cried in each others arms. Physically, it wasn't painful. The laminaria are meant to slowly dilate my cervix and I expected that to be painful but it really wasn't. My heart, however, physically ached. 

The next morning we headed back to the clinic for day two. This time, there were protesters outside the clinic. I guess being first in line to get whatever this years version of Tickle Me Elmo is was more important than chastising us about our sinful ways and saving our eternal souls. Whatever. Fuck those guys. Even if you're anti-choice (I *refuse* to say ""pro-life"" because everyone is pro-life. We all would *prefer* everyone to live...sadly, that's not always feasible) these people are assholes. They think they're going to make positive change in the world by harassing women on what is one of the most vulnerable days of her life? I repeat: fuck those guys. 

For day two I was again put under anesthesia. This time I went under crying. I felt like I should have been able to protect my little boy. The baser part of myself felt like he was scared and I was a bad mother. I wanted him so much and when I woke up, we would be apart forever. It was the single hardest moment of my life. He was gone already, I knew that, but it was with the needle in my arm, as I fell asleep, that I came to terms with my loss and could  no longer control my emotions.

I woke up empty in every sense of the word. I can not remember ever feeling such a sense of loss and I would not wish this level of grief on anyone. I had no idea how much I loved the life inside me until he was gone. 

I also woke up in pain, hooked to an IV and trembling as though I had been locked in a freezer and not napping for the last 30 minutes. The recovery bay is fairly public. I could see as the other girls were wheeled in and out. Each of them took about 15 minutes to recover and no fluids. I took 3 bags, two hours, and seemed to be bleeding much more than everyone else (they closed a privacy curtain every time they checked the pad you were sitting on). The medical staff at Parkmed was great in all ways but one: it was very hard to get information. I'm still not sure what was wrong with me. Once I was coherent enough to swallow without choking I was given some pain pills (though I don't know what they were) and that took the edge off but I was still shaking. About two hours later, I was asked if I thought I could walk to the bathroom. This, I had figured out from watching so many other women come and go, was the first step to getting discharged. I wanted to get discharged and be with my husband. Yes, I decided, I could go to the bathroom. 

In the bathroom they help you sit down and tell you to bear down like you're going number two. Don't wipe, don't flush, don't stand up, and don't lock the door. 5 minutes later they came back, checked the toilet, cleaned me up (not kidding, I wasn't allowed to wipe my own vagina), and walked me to a chair where I got my first snack. It was 3:00pm and I hadn't eaten since 10:00pm the night before since I had to fast for the anesthesia so I was anticipating that cookie and dixie cup of ginger ale. 

Another 30 minutes, one more check of my bleeding and I was allowed to call my husband and change my clothes. I was given a RX for an antibiotic and cytotec to control my bleeding and help my uterus shrink. I was then given instructions not to put anything in my vagina by a very eastern European nurse. ""No tampons, no douching, no intercourse, no anything in your vagina"" she repeated several times. I was warned to get on birth control immediately and explained for the 100th or so time that I had not *wanted* to terminate and that I would be getting pregnant again as soon as possible. 

Here I am, about a week and a half later. My boobs are leaking, I'm still bleeding, but overall, I'm doing better. My husband and I have had many long talks, made lots of bad, tasteless jokes, cried, hugged, and slept. I took a few days off school and he took the week off work so he could be with me. My amazing mother drove 1500 miles just to be with me. I don't need any help but having her here means more than I can express. 

I will see my midwife a week from today to check and make sure my uterus is back to normal. I'm hoping that she'll give me the go ahead to start trying again but I get the impression she thinks we should wait a few months. I'm doing as well as I can be but there is nothing that will make this hurt any less except getting past the anatomy scan in my next pregnancy. I don't want to delay that any more than I have to. I'm struggling significantly with my body image right now. I'm back to that point were nothing fits me right but instead of it being funny and cute, it's just sad. Wearing my maternity clothes is comfortable but bums me out. Going to work all flabby (I'm a personal trainer) makes me self conscious. Having classmates who knew I was pregnant look at me strangely also makes me self conscious. Seeing me also makes others feel awkward. They don't know what to say. They don't know what's ok to ask. I try to answer the ""how are you doing?"" questions as best I can, but they get old. I also feel like there is an expectation of an emotional response and, being a very private person, I'm not comfortable giving one. So, what I'm getting at is, I just want to be pregnant again so everyone can start to move on.

If you're still with me at this point in the story, know that I'll answer any respectful questions. If you are going through something similar and want to talk, please, reach out to me. I know everyone grieves differently and I would never presume to know *your* pain but I'm a good listener and I may be able to help you find resources if you need help. If you are still happily and healthfully pregnant, I am so very happy for you. I wish you nothing but joy. 

Edit: I wanted to add that you ladies have been amazing. When I initially posted our news, the outpouring of support was unbelievable. I will still be following your stories occasionally and I hope to be back among your ranks soon. Please continue to be the honest, fun loving, light hearted silver lining in what can be a long, lonely, exciting, and terrifying 9 months. You're truly an amazing group of gals (and guys).

http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1c2d7w/ran_into_some_problems_at_6_weeks_no_news_yet_im/

**This morning, I posted this:** http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1c7nx1/update_to_running_into_some_problems_at_6_weeks/ 

**And then this afternoon, this happened:**

I went in for an ultrasound today to confirm the miscarriage diagnosis.  The doctor and I discussed options, and we decided on a D&amp;C (the same procedure as an abortion), because I didn't want to go through the miscarriage at home.

Half an hour later, he pulls out the ultrasound.  The probe goes in and... he looks shocked.  He actually uttered the words, ""fuck me...""

I asked what was wrong.  I thought he was seeing some horrendous cancer or something.

Nope.  He was seeing a baby.

**[*My* baby](http://i.imgur.com/eEWESCk.jpg).**

He turned the monitor, and amidst tearing up himself, he says ""That's the heartbeat.  Your baby is fine.  100% fine.  I have goosebumps!""

 


The nurse with us started crying softly, and I cried unabashedly.  I sobbed right down from my gut.  The nurse, Claudia, had to help me sit up so I didn't aspirate on my own spit.

""Here, look, here... that's the head.  You're 7 weeks and 1 day.  It looks so healthy.""

They couldn't find anything in the gestational sac on Tuesday, likely because my bladder was pretty empty.  Today, I had to pee REALLY BAD by the time he started the ultrasound, but he asked me to wait before going.  I am so glad I waited.

Apparently the hormone levels are so high, it's okay that they've come down by about 8% (75k to 68k, usually they level out at 100k by the 12th week, but mine were already 75k at 6 weeks).


Yesterday, I'd had a miscarriage.  Today, I am 7 weeks and 1 day pregnant with a healthy little smudge on the monitor.

**I AM HAVING THE BEST DAY EVER!**

I couldn't type this with my phone, because that would be madness, and I haven't been able to make it to the library for obvious reasons.  Four weeks out, I finally have a moment with my sleeping baby and an internet connection.

So on the evening of May 1, a Wednesday, I was hanging out at our house, enjoying my admittedly too-easy pregnancy.  The midwives I'd been seeing for a the past four months hadn't done any sort of cervical check yet, with no plans to do one until my due date on May 9.  My boyfriend, G, was at work, and would be until 5:30 A.M., but his mother (a paramedic) and daughter (age 8 – yay!  I'd made it past her birthday on April 28) were home and asleep.  At about eleven I started feeling mild crampiness, of the period variety, but I shrugged it off and continued to play Super Paper Mario.  After a while the cramps became timeable, so I got out my handy-dandy contraction timer and happily calculated, but I was kind of disappointed to find that they were extremely erratic in both duration and spacing.  I figured I was in very early labor and resigned myself to chilling out, and hey, G would probably be off work by the time things started to ramp up.  My mom wishing a twenty-six hour labor on me was fresh in my mind, so mentally I was prepared for the long haul.
The contractions (or pressure waves, according to that woman) really didn't get painful until around two, but they were still irregular.  I seemed to have dodged the back labor bullet, but they did start to smart after a while. Hypnobabies wasn't doing a thing for me, though rolling my hips, singing and showering went a long way towards helping, but soon enough all I was doing was writhing around on the bed – it felt oddly good.  I noticed they were evening out, all of a sudden, towards being five minutes apart, so I called the midwife on call and she calmly told me to start the hour-long drive to the hospital.  This whole time I'd been casually texting an increasingly excited G, telling him not to leave work, that I thought I had plenty of time, not to worry.  But all of a sudden...

I felt nauseous.  I was like, Wait, isn't that a sign of transition?  But my water never broke!  It's been suggested that it broke in the shower, but I was only in there for like twenty minutes, and anyway, even if there's a gush, isn't there a trickle afterward?  So I'm like nah.  I felt ferociously thirsty and started chugging water in the bathroom, waiting for vomit to come, but that feeling was suddenly overridden by the urge to push!  And I start feeling bad about the whole thing at this point.  I know I should have called an ambulance instead of trying to make it to the hospital, but in my mind I was deadset against getting carted somewhere and believed I could make it.  So I texted G, “Please come,” which he said made tears spring to his eyes when he saw it at work, and in the time it took him to get home I threw some things in a bag (indeed I had not yet packed a bag, I am not a smart woman) and howled and roared through the urge to push, but sometimes I couldn't fight it, and I would push.  I feel so bad about it!  Man, I was being selfish.  It's amazing to me that everything turned out okay, because I certainly didn't act rationally or responsibly.

When G got home, I had him lay a trash bag and towel in the backseat of my Isuzu Rodeo, thinking my water might break (ho ho).  His mother was, understandably, freaked out by the sounds that had awoken her, though his daughter slept like a baby.  We decided they'd follow us to the hospital a little later, and we set off, with me laying on my side in the backseat, feet propped on the front passenger seat and headrest, and expecting an hour of hell.  In reality it wasn't painful, the contractions had been worse right before transition.  What I didn't expect – though I'd read about it in all sorts of birth stories, dear reader – was the satisfaction of pushing.  It felt so good and right!  It was like my brain knew I was being stupid, but my body was in charge and it wanted to go it alone.  About twenty minutes into the drive, as we were nearing our college town, I realized something was emerging, and I started to freak out and cry in a very dry, tearless way, because I thought for some reason that it wasn't his head.  It didn't feel like a head to me, but G has said he knew I was being ridiculous.  The baby had been head down for a month or more, according to the midwives.  In any case, not pushing was no longer an option, so I gave it two good ones as G got on the phone with 911.  They were commanding him to pull over just as my son's head popped out – didn't have the presence of mind to ease it out – and his body followed so easily, it was like a dream.  I definitely screamed when I felt the ring of fire, but I swear I barely remember any pain other than that.  Post-baby endorphins?  Are a regiment of squats, kegels, red raspberry leaf tea, and dates really the answer to labor pain?  Or am I truly the luckiest woman in America?  I don't know.  I had grabbed his head and was already pulling down my dress – I had had the presence of mind to wear a comfortable, strapless, unloved dress – to put him on my chest when he started to cry.  I started laughing, and G asked if I wanted him to pull over to wait for an ambulance, but I nonchalantly (I was too busy feeling ecstatic at hearing that baby cry so lustily) replied that we were fine and only a few minutes from the hospital anyway, so keep going (I mean from the college town's hospital, not the one with the midwives where we were expected).  He was covered in gross but I loved him.  I remember the way the streetlights were periodically lighting up the inside of my car, and I loved Walter Nimbus and G so much in that moment.  And since then, really.

The baby was chill and peering around by the time we pulled into the emergency room parking lot.  There were, like, ten people waiting for us, but when they saw we were okay they were calm, and even let G cut the cord (it was bizarre looking!) standing outside the back passenger door.  A doctor took my son and I was helped onto a bed (I deliberately did not look behind me at the towel on the seat, but I've seen the blood stains that got through to the seat itself and they're not so bad – a bitch to detail, but not so bad), and they were kind enough to give me back my son to hold against my body as they wheeled me through the hospital to labor and delivery – no need for the emergency room.  I was grinning like a fool the whole time.  Two women helped distract me by trying to get him to nurse, while a doctor stitched up my second degree tear.  The birth certificate lady had quite a time figuring out what to put down for who delivered him (can't be the mother in our state, so it had to be the next person who touched him, that doctor at the ER) and where he was born (since we didn't stop the car, she had to put down the hospital – and in fact he was the first baby to be 'born' at the hospital that day, so he had the honor of being Thursday's Baby.  Here's the video, he's the second baby http://youtu.be/7zwhxB24Bfs).  All in all, despite my recklessness, he's gonna have quite a story.  (I'll add pics later, time's running out!)

I really thought I was going to get my comeuppance for having such an easy birth, because I hadn't been able to get the antibiotics for group B strep, so I was terrified for him, but his bloodwork was normal and they even let him go home with me on schedule, instead of keeping him for two extra days for observation, as they'd warned me.  I really can't believe I got so lucky.  I didn't do anything to deserve that luck, and as a result I have the gnawing fear that my next pregnancy and birth will be a nightmare, so for now I'm holding my baby and not thinking about the future, or the past.  I just know we love him.

Good luck to all y'all lovely ladies, you were so kind to me!  You and your babies and your families deserve the best in the world!

TL;DR Five hour labor, baby boy born naturally and accidentally in the car, 8lb 1oz, 19 inches, strep anxiety, everything's awesome :)

Also adding that I drank red raspberry leaf tea throughout my pregnancy. Dunno if it did anything, but it did taste good with honey!  Also forgot to mention that I did have a second degree tear and I popped a hemorrhoid - TMI, sorry, but it wasn't all sunshine and roses downstairs.

I was like, ""awesome, go for it"". It's not something he would usually do in 100 years and I had Sun off work for a change so I was excited.

Cut to Sun morning. We wake up and he says that he is just going to go shopping for breakfast type things and will be back soon. I figure, hell, if I'm going to have breakfast made for me, its gunna be in bed. So I rolled over and went back to sleep.

I didn't wake up until I heard his car pull up in the drive and his door close. I hear him come inside carrying bags and I get out of bed to go pee.

As I walk round the corner in the hallway I walk straight into my mother!!!!

He didn't go to the shops at all! He had gone to the airport to get my mum who has flown from Sydney to visit for the week as a surprise!!!

Best surprise ever considering how homesick I have been lately (see my last thread I posted here).

He organised for her to come, even though she drives him nuts and he is going to have a very frustrating week of my mother and I arguing over everything like we always do lol.

We haven't seen eachother since December so she was excited to see my big belly and is taking lots of photos to show my dad.

She came to my OB appointment with me today, and kept me company while I had my glucose test this morning. My OB was happy to take some extra time taking her on a grand tour of the contents of my uterus via ultrasound and she even felt bubs kick last night!

1375343504.0,165,self.BabyBumps,1jhce2,Logan's Non-Medicated Vaginal Birth Story (long but pics!),RayningAcid,197,32,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1jhce2/logans_nonmedicated_vaginal_birth_story_long_but/,"Forgive me if this is in broken sentences, my right shoulder is someone’s bed! As some of you might remember, I was VERY overdue to give birth by the time my induction rolled around last Wednesday.  I had a membrane sweep the Wednesday before, but it had no effect.  I arrived at 8:30 am on July 24th for my induction, and had some monitoring done.  It was the first time I’d been hooked up to a monitor for an extended period of time, and it was really neat to get to hear his little heartbeat for that long.  Everything was fine, and they decided it was time to get on with the induction.

A midwife gave me a cervical exam (yay for being in the UK, it was only the second time through my whole pregnancy someone had messed with my business), and proclaimed that I had never had a membrane sweep.  I reminded the midwife that it was in my notes that I had one the previous week, the doctor’s name who had done it, and that it had no effect.  She smiled and said there was no way, as my cervix was high and not dilated at all, there was no way a doctor could have reached the membranes.  She inserted some medicine called “Propess”, which looked like a flat tampon, complete with a string.  The whole thing goes up into your business, and you don’t have to worry about it again.  

After the Propess was inserted, additional monitoring of the baby was required for 30 minutes, and at the end the midwife said a doctor would come in and do an ultrasound to check amniotic fluid levels.  30 minutes later, the midwife and the doctor who had “performed” the membrane sweep the week before came in.  She apologised for not putting me in labor, and behind her the nurse was trying VERY hard not to laugh at the doctor, which made it hard for me not to laugh at the doctor as well.  The ultrasound was fine, and I was sent home, with instructions to come back for additional monitoring at 18:30. 

Around 2 in the afternoon the contractions started. By 18:00, they were so painful that I had trouble walking to my bus.  My husband and I arrived back at the hospital, and we told them immediately that I was in a large amount of pain.  The midwife said first baby, lay down and be monitored.  It was very hard to lay on the cot for the 30 minutes as the contractions were very close together.  I ended up crying for most of it, and my poor husband tried to make the midwife understand that she should check me. Midwife said first baby,so go home, and not to come in unless-now you’re not reading this wrong but I’m going to all caps it as this is relevant later-THE CONTRACTIONS LAST 120 SECONDS EVERY FIVE MINUTES FOR AN HOUR.  She even wrote this in my maternity notes (in the UK, this is like a part of your chart that you carry with you until the delivery).  I couldn’t stop crying, between pain and anger.  She asked me why I hadn’t taken anything for the pain, and gave me Tylenol with Codeine,and sent me home.

By the time I go home I was angry, and vowed not to go back there until my appointment . Timed the contractions,which were a minute and a few seconds a piece.  Husband went out and got us a pizza, I took a shower, and typed some angry things to my supportive friends in a Facebook group. They kept me sane until we decided to go to bed around midnight.

Husband was able to fall right asleep, but I was too uncomfortable. Started timing the contractions again, they were just ridiculous . However none were 120 seconds, and I wasn't going to go up to the hospital. Around 3am, I decided that sleep just wasn't going to happen, and I'd just get up and tough it out til the appointment .  Took a shower, and then spent some quality time sitting on the toilet, where my waters broke, and it felt like the Propess fell out. I stopped timing the contractions, because I was seriously pissed at the 120 second thing, and eff that midwife, I was going to wait until 8am when the clinic opened, even if my appointment wasn’t until 9:30.  They were non stop by this point anyways, there was no real point in timing them any longer.  

At 7am, I lost my shit.  Woke up the husband and said GO TIME, I was in so much pain I absolutely couldn’t handle it any longer.  He got up, dressed, and called the cab in record time.  We made it to the hospital about 7:30 am.  Up the elevator to the labor ward, but oh no I’m sorry, it’s after hours we need you to go to triage. Back down the elevator and across the hospital to triage we went.  I could barely walk, and the woman in triage said I had to lay down and let the baby be monitored.  This just wasn’t an option, I REALLY needed something for pain, or the baby to come out.  She fought with me about it through the contractions for 30 minutes, until finally she said fine, and took me up to see a doctor on the Labour ward.  

I layed on the exam table, and the doctor said “Oh right, she’s 8cm, I guess she is in pain”.  They called for the anesthesiologist as it was planned for me to have an epidural, and handed me some sort of tube that had “gas and air”.  I threw this tube down because it was heavy and I wanted to squeeze the bed. The anesthesiologists were quick about getting there, but I was unable to sit the way they wanted on the bed.  This was the same for the monitoring they wanted to do.  I ended up telling everyone to fuck off.  Yes, I was the lady who swore.  I believe the words were IF YOU’RE NOT GIVING ME A SHOT OF STADOL OR MORPHINE, LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE, I CANNOT SIT ON THE FUCKING BED WITH MY LEGS STRAIGHT OUT. They repeatedly asked me to take the gas and air since I was in so much pain, but | refused.  No epi? Right then, I’ll go unmedicated.  

At 8:20 I ripped the monitors off and insisted that I was going to go pee, as I would “not lose my dignity enough to piss myself in front of my husband”...lol.  The midwife accidentally ripped the IV out sometime around then, but it didn’t hurt much.  As soon as I sat on the toilet, I had the urge to push.  The midwife starts yelling RAYNINGACID YOUR CHILD DESERVES NOT TO BE BORN IN THE BATHROOM!! and I had to agree with that.  I went and knelt beside the bed, for a minute, while some other midwife came in and told me to climb back in the bed on my hands and knees, it would make the baby come closer.  I told this midwife to fuck herself, I’d give birth how I wanted, and get out of my room.  The husband helped me climb back in bed at 8:30.

The remaining midwife (had managed not to kick ONE person out of the room...woo! Go me!) said perhaps I should give that a try, and I told her THIS BABY IS COMING NOW! and in one massive push, Logan came shooting into the world at 8:33 am, July 25.  I opened my eye just in time to see it.  He didn’t come out gracefully. Think of a cannon.  He literally shot across the bed.  It looked like the midwife was playing trying to catch a ball that she was unsure of where the landing point was.  She said she hadn’t seen anything like it before, and I tried to make a joke about how he was Wolverine and he’d come out how he wanted to.  One push, second degree tear, not bad! 

Logan is a week old today, and he’s absolutely wonderful.  If you made it this far, [you deserve a reward!](http://imgur.com/a/T6vP0#0)

Monday Night:

I had been having braxton hicks for weeks and a few strong contractions thrown in here and there.  I decided I wanted out of the house so me, Cashion, and my friend Heidi went to see the Batman movie in the city cinema.  About 10 minutes in I start getting strong contractions about 5 minutes apart throughout the whole movie.  I remember being pretty excited about possibly starting labor but remember nothing about that movie.  I get home and everything stops.  

Tuesday:  

All day contractions very irregular.  For a while we got contractions going 3-4 minutes apart and about a minute in length.  Right as I'm getting ready to go to the hospital I notice they are getting further and further apart.  Then stopped.  Annoying?  Yes, but I knew she was coming soon.  

Me, my mom, Heidi, and Cashion all played rounds of UNO hoping the contractions would kick up again but they never did.  That was until about 7:00pm at night I text messaged my Doula letting her know that nothing was happening and that I was going to sleep.  Literally a few minutes after sending that text there was a soft ""POP"" in my abdomen followed IMMEDIATELY but insane pain.   I didn't even realize the pain was contractions because they were on top of each other and LONG.  I scream for Cashion to help me get to the car and everyone is scrambling to get going after just getting ready to go to sleep.  I'm in the passenger seat of the car trying to breath through the pain and I loose my plug and have my bloody show right there.  Within a minute there is fluid leaking out little by little as well.  All within about 3 minutes from the POP noise.

Cashion hauls ass to the hospital freaking out because he sees I'm in so much pain I can't even respond to him.  The contractions felt like someone was ripping my abdomen muscles out of body.  I've always had strong period cramps and thought contractions would be an exaggerated form of that... but seriously... these were difficult to even breath through let alone talk.

We get to the hospital, the contractions are about a minute to two minutes apart with feelings of wanting to vomit in between.  It is a struggle to work my way down to the labor ward, for some reason I did not want to get in the wheel chair, the thought of sitting at the time was awful to me so I gripped the walls and moved little by little to the ""First Stage Room"".  This is small room I had picked out to labor in that had a bathroom in it but was mainly used for storage.  They set up a bed in there and everything while I sat on the toilet making animalistic noises.

Finally they give me a cervical check after about 30 minutes and she tells me I'm only 1-2 cm dilated and the baby's head is at 4 stage which apparently is the highest up possible.  This was the first time I wanted to cry.  I didn't know how much more of the pain I could take.

They get my doctor in to see me and I'm just standing with my legs spread rocking back and forth leaning on the bed.  The doctor said that I'm probably going to have a slow labor, that the strength of my contractions are not matching up with where the baby is positioned and how my cervix is not dilating.  He offered some basic pain meds, I said no, for now I could thought I could handle it.  He said he was going back home to rest up and to call if things progress.  This was the second time I almost cried.

Pacing back and forth, rocking on a ball, using different positions and moaning different noises, nothing helped with the pain, and they were consistently 2 minutes apart for about 4 more hours.  Finally the nurse came back to check on my progress.  I can't even lay down I'm in so much pain, and I'm about to lose my shit on the nurse who is not paying attention to that 2 minute window she has to check me between contractions.  She checks me and shakes her head and says ""I'm sorry... Mia Kapalamula, you are still 1 1/2 cm dilated and station 4, the baby has not moved down.""  This is the third time I almost cried.  I asked for the pain med injection.  I don't remember what it is but they said it ""might"" take a little edge off.

After the injection the only different I noticed is my body's urge to try and sleep during that 1 1/2 minute window between contractions.  The contractions felt exactly the same.  It completely wore off after 45 minutes and I was told I could not have another injection for another 6 hours.  I was also told there would be no other method of pain relief.

The vacation Doctor:

I was told that the option to have an epidural would be available a week before.  After being told there was no progress and that no other pain relief was available, I called my doctor asking if I could get the epi.  He told me that the only doctor qualified to administer an epi was out of town for 2 weeks.  This was the fourth time I almost cried.  I don't even remember hanging up because I was hit with a contraction so hard I could hang up the phone.  

My mom...

At this point I hadn't slept for 2 days because of prior contractions and had been hit with these contractions every 1 1/2 minutes for the past 8 hours and it took the turn for the worst.  I don't know if it was my body giving out on me or if they were progressing but I started screaming for my mom during the contractions.  Like a little girl that is hurt and wants her mom to make it better and it brought my mom to tears and I just gripped onto her as hard as I could and this was the first time I actually cried.  I told finally told her ""Mom I can't do this anymore."" She kept telling me ""Yes you can, you can do this.""  I could see it was killing her to not be able to help me. It got me through a few more hours.  I hate to say it but Cashion wasn't even on my radar during this, I just wanted my mom.  

My mom helped walk me to the shower since the contractions threw me down to my knees each time and the warm water provided the most brief sensation of relief.  It was what I needed to get me through the next 30 minutes before they checked me again for progress.

The Last Check:

There was no longer any space between my contractions, I'd say about 30 seconds so checking me meant checking me during a contraction and laying on my back which was the worst position ever.  I thought at this point if she had worked her way down... AT ALL I might be able to do this.  ""3 cm dilated... 4 station"".  She didn't budge in the slightest.  Ladies... this is where I lost my shit.  I literally went insane.  I screamed and screamed and hyperventilated through my contractions and apparently freaked the crap out of everyone, especially Cashion.  From what I can remember and what people told me... I just kept saying something is wrong, the pain is too much, she's not moving down, something's wrong something's wrong, over and and over.  My friend Heidi and my mom kept telling me I could do it, that my body was made for it, and I wish I could say I took it with grace and responded with class, but I basically told them to STFU.  I honestly had no control over my emotions at this point.  

The nurses had already been recommending a C Section because of the frequency and strength of the contractions without progress and said that I wouldn't even have the energy to push if the time every came.  Heidi did what I had asked her to do and fought the C Section conversation again and again until I finally told them ""I want it, call the doctor, I want the C Section.""  I cried out during a contraction that I didn't have a choice, that I could't do it, that there was something wrong and eventually everyone listened and within 30 minutes I was being wheeled into the surgical theater.  

I screamed the whole way, I was on my back which was the most painful for me, and I don't remember even a second between contractions for me to be able to breath.

Somehow they got me up on the surgical bed and sitting upright.  Three nurses held me down as they proceeded to try and keep me still.  I don't think it was the contractions causing me to shake so vigorously... I mean it was cold and all but I was shaking violently, I thought there wuld be no way to give me a spinal block.  I still don't know the difference between an epi and spinal block.  I don't know how long this took, but it took a while, and the pain was so excruciating that I felt like I was blacking out at times.  Then finally... there was a tingle in my feet.... and then relief.  I felt no pain at all.  I almost instantly fell asleep.  I had no idea how tired my body was until I got that spinal block and my body for the first time in 12 hours was able to get a break.   This was also the first time I really questioned if I was doing the right thing... what if I selfishly took this as an ""out"" for the pain and am putting my baby in a worse position now?  What if my feeling of ""something is wrong"" is my mind finding an excuse to have a c section? I kept thinking, if something happens to her, I'll never forgive myself.  I know these are not the right things to think about, but after preparing for a natural birth and doing so much research ahead of time I couldn't help but feel like a complete failure.

This time I didn't call for my mom, I wanted my Husband. Cashion came in with his scrubs and little hat on.  He sat next to me and told me he loved me.  This was the second time I really cried.  He just kept stroking my face and despite him being absolutely terrified of the entire night (Heidi and my mom informed me after all was said and done how upsetting the whole labor was for him and how scared he was for me to be in surgery).  he kept his cool and just stared at my face the whole time.  I slept off and on through the procedure until I woke up to the sound of Zahara screaming her lungs off.  They lifted her up over the curtain for a brief second and I saw her.  A real baby.  Cashion just put his forehead to mine and started crying and we cried together.  She scored 8/10 for her apgar and 10/10 a minute later.  I slept while they finished putting me back together.  I wasn't around for when they wheeled Zahara into the nursery and my mom and Heidi got to see her and get an update but I hear it was a special moment for them.  Cashion was with Zahara the whole time that I couldn't be, just like we talked about.

I'm now at home, they discharged me after just about 24 hours because I could get up, walk around, and had a bowel movement.  My mom, being in the medical field, couldn't help but want me out of there after witnessing horrible hygiene practices.  

The problem?

The doctor came in and let us know that her head was not sitting right down in the pelvis and that her little face was smushed up against it and that is why she had a big ol knot on her head.  Also there was a good amount of meconium all over her but luckily didn't get into her lungs.  I don't know if she would have ever come out naturally but I just didn't have it in me to go any further.  Maybe if I had some kind of pain relief but the old natural way?  I couldn't do it.

Zahara is having a hard time nursing but is slowly getting the hang of it.  She loves her fingers instead, and if we swaddle her to keep her fingers down, she just gets so pissed she doesn't want to nurse.  She actually slapped my boob away at one point, her first day alive.  It was pretty comical to all the nurses and everyone at the hospital fell in love with her pretty quickly.  

I'm now sitting in bed, she's in her bassinet next to mine under her little mosquito net, Cashion next to me snoring off his trauma, and I couldn't be happier.  

Cashion's Perspective:  For those of you that were not here months back, My husband is Malawian and it was never the culture for the man to be apart of the labor process.  They typically go out drinking and celebrating then come after the baby is born.  He had NO IDEA the kind of pain women suffer during childbirth.  He has been amazing throughout this whole thing and I love him so much.  I also see my mother in a whole new light.  She said she was only in active labor for 2 hours tops with all 3 of her kids and that she was really proud of me.

Here's to hoping I heal at home properly and thanks again to all the ladies that supported me throughout this entire journey.  I did take pictures but I don't want to get out of my net in the dark to go get the memory card right now.  Here are some my mom and Heidi took while I was in the recovery room after surgery:

Still had them around 7am when I got my boyfriend's daughter ready for school. By 9:30am the pain was becoming unbearable and I knew they weren't just Braxton Hicks.

Came to the hospital and they checked me. No blood, no dilation, no real contractions. They had no idea. Baby had a heartbeat, but I was screaming in pain. Eventually my doctor showed up and we did an ultrasound. At this point no heartbeat could be found, and I have never been in so much pain in my life.

He tells my boyfriend and I that I had a placental abruption but they have no idea why. There's nothing I could have done to prevent it, and nothing I did wrong. But I lost the baby. His heartbeat stopped sometime while I was here at the hospital.

Was finally able to get an epidural around 3pm yesterday. I've been lying in this bed now for 15 hours waiting for labor to progress so I can deliver our baby.

I don't even know what emotion I'm feeling. I go back and forth. But really, why me? Why us? I did everything right. 

I'm happy we got to spend the time together that we did. I'll miss his kicks and rolls and hearing his heartbeat. I guess it just wasn't my time to be a mom...

7cm now and should deliver within the next few hours. I just don't know what to do with myself...

I hope I can get through this.

He usually works 6 days a week, 8-12 hours per shift, and only gets the 1 day off because of company policy. He originally scheduled vacation starting August 17th-25th, so we knew he would be able to be home for some of our little girl's first days. 

Then, induction was scheduled for August 13th (technically the 14th) at midnight. He had one personal day, so we were going to go in after he got home from work on the 13th and he would use his personal day on the 14th, but I would be in the hospital by myself. His supervisor told him yesterday that they may need to move his vacation due to someone else with more seniority wanting a couple days off during that week. The reason? Other dude wants to go fishing. His supervisor said he didn't care *why* he wanted days off and he would go by seniority. SO went to their main HR lady and explained the situation to her and why he wanted that week off work...

Not only did she say his vacation is set and WILL NOT be changed since he requested it first.. she found he has an additional 2 vacation days that he gained with a promotion/raise a while back!!! AND THEY CONFIRMED EVERYTHING TODAY WITH THE NEXT LEVEL UP OF HR! THEY ABSOLUTELY CANNOT TAKE IT AWAY FROM HIM!!! :D

So now, he'll be able to be with me all of Wednesday, Thursday, a coworker *volunteered* to cover his shift Friday (I'm currently making him cookies!) and then he'll be off work and home with us until the follow Sunday!

I farted on Michele Bachmann on Thursday. You know, the nutjob lady who ran for President?

I dropped my sister off at the bus station (we live close to DC) and heard about all the craziness at the Supreme Court building (Obamacare stuff) so I decided to park and check it out. Lots of famous politicians and newspeople...I got a ton of pics. I was standing on the (crowded) steps of the Supreme Court building and this kid tapped me on the shoulder and told me I am standing next to Michele Bachman. WTF. I took some pictures. Then I had to fart. There was no stopping it. I basically cropdusted everyone within a 20 foot radius of me, which of course included Michele Bachmann. It was silent, but deadly.

I didn’t realize it’d been so long until I was reminded in my past thread found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1ctre4/spontaneous_triplets_update/). 

I’m exactly 25 weeks along today! We found out they were all boys during our 18 week ultrasound, and it has been confirmed every time since. They are not shy! Everyone has been doing well and continues to do well. There was some concern about the two identical boys because they had some markers for Down syndrome (calcifications in their stomachs and abdomens), but we declined an amnio and those markers have since faded. 

Baby A, who is closest to my cervix, is very active and I can feel him flip, flop and turn whenever he’s awake. Babies B &amp;amp; C I haven’t been able to feel more than a stray kick or elbow from since they've an anterior placenta, but I’ll listen to their movements and heartbeats with my doppler when I’m paranoid. Babies B &amp;amp; C are also smaller than their brother who has his own placenta. Last ultrasound, A was estimated at 1.7 lbs, while B was 1.4 and C 1.0. 

Baby C, in particular, they’re keeping an eye on because he has a velamentous cord insertion and at one point they suspected IUGR. So far, though, he’s been growing appropriately albeit at a rate behind his siblings. If that stops happening, I’ll likely be sent to the hospital for continuous monitoring. 

The goal is still to make it to 35 weeks, and in the meantime, I’m eating upwards of 3-4k calories a day to bulk these little guys up in case I don’t. Fortunately, they’re not pushing on my stomach too much, so I haven’t had too much issue stuffing my face. Double cheeseburger with bacon, anyone? :) 

**TL;DR**: Triplets and mom doing great. Eating lots, taking it easy and hoping we make it as close to full term as we can!

I got a call on Tuesday from a friend's dad who runs a tech writing group (my dream career); he had an opening and wanted to see if I was interested. Because we were already on friendly terms, I told him I just found out I was pregnant and if he needed to reconsider me for the opening, I would understand. A phone interview with the supervisor and a thank you note FROM her (!) later, I got the job. The pay is less than what I'm making now, but it's work from home. This is especially important since my husband works on an oil rig away from home 75% of the time. Now that the initial terror of finding out I'm pregnant, and the fears of finding a job near home are gone, I'm starting to get real excited about this baby!

1. I did not shit out my sanity the moment i became pregnant (yes sometimes I'll get emotional, and perhaps ""hormonal"", but that's no excuse to treat me like a crazy person)

2. I am very well aware of the basic food groups i should be eating but you know what, if i feel like a doughnut I'm gonna have a doughnut and I'll tell you what you can do with your whole grains and vegetables

3. its  a cup of coffee people not a line of cocaine!

4. its NOT ok to comment on my pregnancy weight (its not ok to comment on anyone's weight, so why is it ok to comment on a pregnant lady's weight?)

5. When someone asks me how i'm doing and i tell them i'm having  a hard day and am starting to feel bigger its NOT ok to say ""OH its only going to get worse you know!"" (Fuck really?! I thought i would be able to fit into a size 2 dress by the time this is done!)

Friday was like any other day. I went to work and left to my weekly Dr. visit. I had one more visit on the 21st planned and then my scheduled c-section was on the 26th. I had noticed that the few days before my appt. I had felt a decrease in movement. I figured I was getting really big and he was losing space. I could still feel him change position from time to time, but the overall kicks and punchs had decreased a bit. So, the Dr. asked me how he was moving on Friday. I told her what I just said. She said that he should be moving at least 3 times every half hour so they were going to monitor him for the next half hour.

I laid there strapped to that machine and saw and heard his heart beat. His heart seemed strong and there was nothing wrong. After a half hour the Dr. came in and said that it showed little to no movement on the machine, so she had me lie on my side and drink some juice. After another half an hour, she came back and said that I needed to go to the ER because she still wasn't picking up a lot of movement. I'm pretty freaked at this point, but because I heard his heart beat I didn't think too far ahead. At the hospital, they get me hooked up to an IV which I thought was weird considering they just wanted to monitor me. The nurse hooked me up the same machine and watched it for another half hour. Everything looked fine. She said that they just wanted to see some movement. By then, the Dr. had come and she took a look at the test and told me not to drink any fluids in case I had to go in for surgery. I was totally freaked out at this point, because why would I need to go in for surgery if they kept reassuring me that everything was fine?

For hours they had me monitored and said his heart beat was perfect but that he wasn't really moving. I got up to give them a urine sample and when I lied back down, the nurse called the Dr. back in and they kind of talked in the corner out of ear shot. The Dr. said she wanted to do an ultrasound. She told me that he had almost no fluid around him and that it looked like my placenta had began to detach, so we were going to have this baby right now. 

I looked at my husband and you could see the panic in his face. They rushed me to surgery. I didn't have time for a spinal so they put me under. I went to sleep not knowing what was going on or whether or not Xander was in danger.  I woke up. I woke up to 20 people standing around me and my husband sobbing, telling me that Xander didn't make it. He was stillborn. It took me hours to wear off the drugs they gave me. I got to hold him and say goodbye. I want to crawl in a hole and die. He was here one minute and gone the next. I'm still pretty out of it, but I just wanted to say to love what you have while you have it because you never know when it will be taken away from you.

Edit: Thank you all so much for the heartfelt sympathies. It's been over a week and some days are ok and some days I wish I could die. I have been trying to be strong for my other son who needs his mother and honestly, it helps to have him to take care of. We are expecting his ashes sometime this week and hopefully putting him to rest will give us some kind of closure. My husband and I are very different and are grieving very differently, but have managed to really come together this week for each other. I've been journaling and it helps a bit. The hardest part has been the silence. As long as I am distracted everything seems ok. As soon as silence hits I fall apart. I know that I cannot run away from it, but right now that's all I want to do. All of this newborn stuff in my house is like torture, and I can't wait to get it out of here. Now I'm rambling.

So in an effort to entertain myself I've written a little poem and I thought I'd share it with you ladies. Thankfully, I haven't experienced everything I've written about in here!

Here’s a little something I thought I’d compose

Now that this pregnancy comes to a close

These past months haven’t been easy for me

So to you I give my version of pregnancy’s ABC’s

A-is for acne on face, back and chest

B-is for bloating making you feel your very best 

C-constipation-backing you up all week

D-diarrhea that interrupts you when you sleep

E-is for exhaustion that messes with your head

F- is for forgetfulness that...did I leave my lights on?

G-is the way you clear rooms with your gas

H- are the hemorrhoids that are a pain in the ass

I-for indigestion the gift that keeps right on giving

J-for the junk food-making life still worth living

K-are the Kegles you do out of fear 

to stop

L-all that leakage when you sneeze or shed tears

M-morning sickness and the glow that it brings

N-is for nesting-I must clean all the things!

O-is for OB-your friend or your foe

P-is for period-at least that’s one thing that goes!

Q-all those questions that are rather invasive

R-is for ranting-the reasons pervasive

S-are for stretch marks that make you look like you’ve been attacked

T-for the TUMS that you keep tossing back

U-all that urination every minute or two

V-is for varicose veins in five shades of blue

W-is for weight that goes higher and higher

X-is for x-rated things that you no longer desire

Y-is for yeast infection because being itchy rocks!

Z-for the z’s your missing while watching the clock

Oh dear baby within me, please don’t be hurt by these rhymes

For you I’d go through all these things a million times

I know you will be worth all this bother

But now please come out and meet me and your father!

On Friday, July 12, I started to spot a little. I got really nervous and called the doctor who told me, like everything I had read, to just take it easy and drink water and stay off my feet. If it didn't stop by Monday, call for an appointment. 
Well, Saturday the spotting continued and never changed in consistency or in the amount I was spotting, which was just slight and didn't even fill a pad. Then on Sunday morning it was the same. On Sunday afternoon, at around 1:45 p.m., I used the bathroom and saw a quarter-sized clot when I wiped. I had the husband take me to the emergency room. I thought I had miscarried. 
We get there and they take my vitals and blood and my iron is dangerously low so they start an IV and get a second line ready in case they need to do a blood transfusion. By the time this was done, they were ready for the ultrasound which they did both internally and externally. Within 20 minutes after the ultrasound, the doctor was in telling me I had an ectopic pregnancy that had ruptured and then began prepping me for emergency surgery. By 4:45 on Sunday afternoon, I was given anesthesia, and was in recovery by 7:00 p.m. that evening.
When I was in my room and the doctor visited, he told me they had to remove the left fallopian tube and ovary, and an extremely large amount of blood. And, I might still need the transfusion, but due to the high amount of risks, they didn't want to give it to me unless absolutely necessary. They were also surprised that I didn't have any pain before the surgery. I didn't really, just a little that I thought was my uterus stretching. 
It's been hard, because I was told I couldn't have kids due to poly cystic ovarian syndrome and other complications. This was a completely surprise pregnancy that was wanted more than words can say. I have a husband who has been a saint through this and a mother who has been there through the tears and pain. I can't thank them enough. 
I just needed to have a place to tell my story. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

You push the baby out, you get rid of the placenta, you snuggle your little squishy and sooner or later you need to get out of bed (usually to go pee).  There will be a RIVER of blood and fluid that pours out of you.  It is impressively massive.  The nurse will probably hold giant absorbent pads between your legs as you waddle so you don't slip and fall in the puddle.

You will leak all over the floor.  You will leave a trail of blood to the bathroom and all over the seat.  You will probably pee while the nurse is in the bathroom with you.  You probably won't care if you do.  Your bathroom will look like someone was murdered.  You will not want any of your family members to go in there after you.

Don't apologize to the nurses (even though I have, every time).  It's part of how this all works, they are used to it and expect it and it doesn't gross them out in the least.

I'm a female to male transsexual. You can learn lots more about me [here.](http://www.youtube.com/user/sillyyetsuccinct?feature=mhee) If you want to know about the medical process of transitioning, I explained it in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzyR7k3GCOw) which is now a few years old and crap quality, but still useful. 

Just to head off the questions I routinely get, I shall supply a little Q&amp;A:

Q Where do you live?
A I was born in the U.S. then moved to Denmark and then to Sweden.

Q Why did you decide to get a sex-change?
A Nobody says ""sex-change"" anymore. It's super inaccurate. I came out of the closet as transgender because I've always been transgender and the secret was killing me. I decided to start medical transition because I spent years being suicidal and I thought it would help. It did. It saved my life. It felt like waking up after being a zombie for 10 years.

Q Have you had surgery?
A Yes. A double mastectomy.

Q Can you breastfeed?
A [This guy did.](http://www.milkjunkies.net/) But I probably can't/won't for many many reasons. I might share them in a breastfeeding thread if one comes up :)

Q Do you have a partner?
A Yes. He supplied the sperm, I supplied the egg.

Q What is your partner's sexuality?
A Homosexual. Same as mine.

Q WHAT?
A Yes, we're a happy gay male couple. Gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same thing. We look like two men and we are it on paper too (I'm legally male). And we experience the same homophobia as other gay couples. When it comes down to it, a relationship is about more than particular genital configurations. 

Q If you like men why didn't you just stay a girl?
A *sigh* Because I'm transgender. I've always been transgender. Getting a boner for dudes didn't ""cure"" me from being transgender. You might as well ask a macho gay guy why he didn't just stay straight. Because that's not the way it works.

Q Won't your hormones fuck up the baby?
A No. I was on medically prescribed and monitored hormone replacement therapy for 2.5 years. I stopped a year ago in order to get pregnant. My endocrinologist and two OB/GYNs agreed that there is no reason why I shouldn't be able to have a perfectly healthy pregnancy.

Q God?
A We don't god.

Q Why did you decide to get pregnant?
A My partner and I don't qualify for adoption in Sweden where we live (loooooong story, maybe I will explain it in an adoption thread if one comes up). Surrogacy and teaming up with a lesbian pair were also not options for us. And we wanted to have a biological child. We figured that parents make all kinds of massive sacrifices for their children, me being pregnant is just one in a whole line of sacrifices we will probably make for them.

Q Did you conceive naturally?
A Yes. Twice. I had a miscarriage in October. I had a miscarriage because sometimes miscarriages happen. It was not because I am transgender. It was awful. We were devastated. But we are absolutely thrilled to get pregnant again so quickly!

Q Pregnancy is the most womanly thing I've ever done. How can you do this and identify as a man?
A That's lovely for you. I'm happy that your pregnancy strengthened your gender identity. For me, it's just this crazy biological thing that I happen to be able to do. Being off my medicine is really hard on me though, and I'm very much looking forward to when we have had our children and I can have my body back. (But don't we all feel that way?)

Q Children?
A We want more than one but not sure how many yet.

Q How do friends/family/work colleagues react?
A They were a bit startled when we first told them our plans (and they had a billion questions), but now they are all very happy for us. They were very supportive about the miscarriage.

Q Will you eventually get a penis?
A This is where things kind of cross the line for me. I want to join a pregnancy forum so that I can participate in pregnancy discussions. I'd really rather not engage in a lengthy, highly intimate conversation about the nature of my genitals. So, can we just not go there? Please?

So what do you say? Can the weirdo queer kid join in all the reindeer games?

EDIT2: Thanks for such a warm welcome everyone!! You are awesome!

My post wasn't meant to come across as defensive-- I was just nervous. I *do* get asked these questions a lot, usually by very nice people. One never knows exactly the right way to come out, so we just take a shot at it and hope for the best.
