1370154579.0,188,self.melbourne,1fiatd,Let's Legalize Airsoft in Victoria!,airsoft_victoria,309,121,177,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1fiatd/lets_legalize_airsoft_in_victoria/,"**What is Airsoft?**    
Airsoft is a recreational sport where competitors use replica firearms to hit each other with spherical, non metallic pellets. Often played in teams, airsoft is a popular sport around the world.

Gameplay of airsoft is varied, but generally, large teams are pitted against each other on large plots of land. Working together, they fire pellets at each other, faking death when hit by pellets from the enemy team. Not only does airsoft encourage strong teamwork and mateship, but is physically challenging, something that could be useful for the most obese country in the world.

Airsoft guns are often gas or spring powered, and shoot small circular non-metal projectiles called airsoft pellets (not to be confused with ball bearings). These replica firearms generally fire at speeds of under 90m/s with a maximum firing range of about 100 metres. Airsoft guns are non-lethal with 0 recorded deaths due to airsoft. 
Additionally, the most powerful airsoft guns can barely break skin. 

In order to break skin, airsoft pellets would have to travel at 90 m/s and hit at a distance of 1 metre or less. This means that the risk of injury from a shot to the body is relatively low. Additionally, breaking skin is not the same as penetrating skin. In airsoft gameplay, injuries are rare except for eye injuries. When wearing adaquete safety gear (goggles and helmet), airsoft guns have almost no risk of injury. 



**Current Victorian Laws Regarding Airsoft:**    
According to a document hosted by Victoria Police which can be found [here](http://www.police.vic.gov.au/content.asp?a=internetBridgingPage&amp;Media_ID=78679), airsoft guns are ""essentially air rifles ... which can achieve muzzle velocity of 200 - 300 feet per second and fire rates of 300 to 700 rounds per minute. This document continues and states the following: ""Licensing &amp; Regulation Division (LRD) will not provide permits to acquire air-soft rifles. This is on the basis that no genuine reason exists to own them, because there is no approved range in Victoria to undertake these war games. Their militaristic appearance also plays a part in their perceived undesirability.""

This document states that airsoft rifles can achieve firing rates of 200 - 300 feet per second (60 - 90 metres per second). From research which can be found [here](http://files.webydo.com/150858/Non-Lethality%20confirmation%20of%20Airsoft%20Guns.pdf) which was published in *The ATFE Journal* volume 44 number 2 - spring 2012, scientists came to the conclusion that ""10 different Airsoft guns, including replicas of pistols, machine guns, assault rifles and bolt action rifles, 
were tested, each with two types of 6mm (0.236in.) plastic pellet: a light one, weighing 0.2 gr (3.09 grain) and a heavy one, 
weighing 0.43 gr (6.63 grain). The muzzle velocity for each shot was measured and the penetration energy of each pellet 
was calculated. Not one shot reached a level of life threatening penetration energy or even a risk of superficial injury to 
the skin. It was determined that shooting Airsoft guns with plastic pellets is not lethal in any way.""

Additionally, airsoft guns are internationally regulated to be sold with orange tips. Although laws vary from country to country, these orange tips are quite easily noticed from a distance and help to diffrentiate replica airsoft guns from actual lethal firearms.

These regulations made by the Victorian Police give no opportunity for airsoft to exist in Victoria. It is clear that airsoft is physically harmless and that airsoft firearm replicas are easy to discern from actual guns. The logic used by the Victorian Police to restrict airsoft guns in Victoria relies on the fact that there are no approved ranges in Victoria for airsoft players to use airsoft guns, and thus airsoft guns have no place in Victoria.

There are a plethora of laser tag and paintball ranges in Victoria. If airsoft was legalized, I am sure that many airsoft ranges would be established There are also organizations in Australia and Victoria dedicated to airsoft (e.g. Airsoft Australia). If airsoft was given the opportunity to grow, there is already a fan base ready and waiting.



**What should be done about airsoft in Victoria?**        
Airsoft is a sport with almost no reason to be illegal and a large fan base ready to play.

The Victorian Parliament holds the power to legalize airsoft within the state of Victoria. I believe that airsoft should be legalized, but regulated. 

Although airsoft is a fun team sport, stronger airsoft guns when using metal pellets have the power to cause injury. In many countries around the world, airsoft is legal but strong airsoft guns using metal pellets are banned. I believe that a similar stance should be taken by Victoria.

Additionally, enforcing orange rings around the barrel of airsoft guns will allow citizens and police of Victoria to be able to discern a difference between replica airsoft firearms and real firearms. I believe that if the Victorian government was to strongly enforce such a law, airsoft would pose little threat to the people of Victoria.



**What can we do to legalize airsoft in Victoria?**    
The most important step to legalize airsoft in Victoria will be to work together. Co-ordination between groups such as /r/melbourne and the Australian Airsoft Council will be crucial.

Together, we will need to draft [a petition](http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/assembly/petitions) which we can then submit to the lower house for debating. If approved by the lower house, the bill will be sent to the upper house where it will be considered. If passed by both houses, the bill will be signed by the governor of Victoria. 

[This page here](http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/assembly/petitions) helps to detail what will need to be done to create a petition. All signatures will need to be signed by hand and include a name and Australian address. 

Information in the petition will be crucial to this cause. If the lower house like the petition, then they may take action.

Additionally, the petition will need to be presented to the lower house by a member of the house. For this reason, we will need to locate a willing member to present for us.



**Goals:**         
In the short term, we need to gain some traction with /r/melbourne and the Australian Airsoft Council. Using the literary skills of members of both groups, a petition would need to be drafted. The petition would then need to be signed by as many people as possible. It may be neccesary to have signing days in the cbd to gain as many signatures as possible. Finally, a member of the lower house would need to be contacted, and the petition would need to be presented.



**What to do right now:**     
If you agree with this cause, please:    
1) Upvote this post for visibility    
2) Check back to /r/melbourne for update    
3) Suggest any corrections for this post    
4) Suggest anything that could be used to help the cause    

Thankyou for your time!

I've just opened a new cafe on Lygon Street and I'd love to have some reddit visitors.  I'm using Gridlock Coffee and chai, Mork Chocolate, McIver's tea and Noisette pastries.  The cafe is at 242 Lygon Street Carlton, just down from Watts shoe store.  I'm running the shop by myself currently, so reference this post by saying 'John Silver', I'll give you a discount on your drink!  I'd love to meet you, and hear your feedback about the place.  Also, if any of you are musos and want your music played in the shop, bring it in and I'll give it a listen, and maybe add it to my Melbourne music playlist.

**Edit:**Forgot the name (The Front Cafe) and the hours (Mon-Fri, 7am-3ish).  Whoops.

Much love, LongPollyCrackerJack.",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,1369039986.0,,,True,t3_1enw24,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1enw24/new_redditor_run_cafe_in_carlton_come_and_visit/,

My phone was stolen at Mana Bar tonight,Jamwa,206,33,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/vmh68/help_me_r_melb_my_phone_was_stolen_at_mana_bar/,"Hey all, probably a fairly useless post but I'm desperate right now and I know a lot of people in /r/ Melbourne are Mana Bar regulars. My phone was stolen at Mana trivia tonight around 7pm. It is a black 64g iPhone 4S with a Captain America shield case &amp; stickers on the back of the phone underneath it. If anyone saw or knows anything or hears of anything from friends or regulars PLEASE contact me or any of the Mana Bar staff. I've done the iPhone tracker thing, contacted Telstra to disable it and reported it stolen to the Fitzroy Police.

Beyond the inconvenience and cost, the phone has tremendous sentimental value due to the aforementioned stickers which were placed there by and have the handwriting of my girlfriend on them from a vacation we had together.

I'm unemployed at the moment (until recently I worked at a certain large purple-coloured video game retailer) &amp; rely on my smartphone for job interview and Centrelink correspondence, and I can't afford to replace the phone until I get working again. So unless it comes back to me I'm in a bit of an awkward spot.

I'd really hugely appreciate a few up-votes just so that this sticks around on the front of /r/ Melbourne for a couple of days. I know the internet is not my personal army and everything but I'm going a bit out of my mind here.

Thank you for reading this and (hopefully) up-voting!

It's been great. Great friendly people. Awesome company and loads of gorgeous people to talk to and be friends with.

But let's cut to the chase.

I was down on Smith St. to do some discount shopping when the urge of a number two came up. The nearest public loo was the hi-tech one with an automatic door and music to sooth the wickedest stomach rumbles. I went in, pressed the magic door button, dropped my pants and sat on the oh so cold plastic seat. 5 minutes in and I was done (I had some serious lamb dinner the previous night and it was hard to pass).

To my horror, the automatic TP dispenser has crapped out. Mind you, that this bathroom automatically opens it doors after a 10 minute session (in case someone dies in there, I don't know) and I've got no TP, no paper, and the bastard won't flush so I can at least wash my ass with shit water unless I leaned over far enough for the automatic hand wash and risk having shit all over my pants. Pressed for time, I had to do the one thing that I have done only once before in my whole life.

Off came one sock. With said sock I quickly wiped down and suddenly the 2 minute warning sound and light has started playing. Sock still in hand, I looked around for a bin and there wasn't any. Except for one small drawer with ""Sanitary Disposal Only"" on one wall.

Fuck that. I flipped it open and, to my surprise, there was another shit soiled sock. Another poor soul has gone through my ordeal and done the same thing. I couldn't help myself and laughed while depositing my own contribution to the fine city. Pulled my pants up, washed my hands and just in time the door opens.

There was a queue of about 5 people waiting for their turn and I could tell they were disgusted that I took 10 minutes to relieve myself. I took this as a cue to NOT tell them about the malfunctioning TP dispenser as I waddled away with one sockless foot.

**TL;DR: Bathroom has no TP, used sock to wipe, found another person's soiled sock in sanitary disposal bin.**",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,False,,,True,t3_tyuul,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/tyuul/my_experience_with_melbournes_hitech_public/,

1335069464.0,139,self.melbourne,sm9fj,I've discovered the unpublished public API for Melbourne's public transport networks.,metlinkapi,151,12,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/sm9fj/ive_discovered_the_unpublished_public_api_for/,"You may have heard about Metlink rebranding as [PTV](http://corp.ptv.vic.gov.au/), which in turn released a *woeful* [""updated"" iPhone app](http://blog.andyblu.me/new-ptv-iphone-app-released-is-an-absolute-farce/).

It got me thinking about the previous Metlink app, and how it worked. Several months ago, Metlink moved from downloading the timetables to live updates over 3G.

I've sniffed the traffic from the iPhone to Metlink's website, where you can find the URLs/API of the data. **The API returns it in JSON**.

I thought I'd share it here, to see what apps/websites/mash-ups the people of [/r/melbourne](/r/melbourne) can make. The data should be made available widely in many formats. It's public interest stuff. Locking it down in PDFs serves no purpose. Obviously Metlink found it useful to have a JSON feed, so why not the broader public?

This is what I've discovered so far. There might be more. 

To start, all calls go to the base URL:  [http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au)

They are in the /services directory as a .php file. 

---

**getTransportLineList**

*values (req)*: transportType

*options*: train, tram, bus, vline, nightrider

This seems to be a list of stations/stops/etc. Eg:

    {""line_name"":""Alamein"",""suburbs"":""Ashburton\/Hawthorn East\/Burnley\/Glen Iris\/Camberwell\/Richmond\/Melbourne City\/Hawthorn""}

*[Sample URL](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getTransportLineList.php?transportType=train&amp;1.50.20102011)* 

---

**getStopListFromTransportLine**

*values (req):* transportLine, transportType

*options:* transportLine: (the line name, eg Alamein) || transportType: train, tram, bus, vline, nightrider

This provides a list of the stations/stops along a route. It also provides a ""location_id"" of the station/tram stop, which is required for the timetable information.

For example, a part of the response for the Alamein train line: 

    {""location_name"":""Alamein "",""suburb"":""Ashburton"",""key_id"":""12"",""location_id"":""1002""},{""location_name"":""Ashburton "",""suburb"":""Ashburton"",""key_id"":""11"",""location_id"":""1010""}

*[Sample URL](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getStopListFromTransportLine.php?transportLine=Alamein&amp;transportType=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)* 

---

**getClosestStopsFromLocation**

*values (req):* currLat, currLon, transportTypes

*options:* currLat &amp; currLon: a GPS co-ordinate || transportTypes: train, tram, bus, vline, nightrider

This is Metlink's geo-lookup feature. Feed it some GPS coordinates, and it'll show you where the closest train station/tram or bus stop are.

*[Sample URL (Brunswick Station)](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getClosestStopsFromLocation.php?currLat=-37.767718&amp;currLon=144.959591&amp;transportTypes=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)* 

---

**getDirectionsForLocationId**

*values(req):* locationID, transportType

*options:* locationID: the ID of the station. You can get the ID from getStopListFromTransportLine ||  transportTypes: train, tram, bus, vline, nightrider

This will tell you which ways the trains are running and on which line.

[*Sample URL*](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getDirectionsForLocationId.php?locationID=1006&amp;transportType=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)

---

**getStopWithIdentifier**

*values(req):* locationID, transportType

*options:* locationID: the ID of the station. You can get the ID from getStopListFromTransportLine ||  transportTypes: train, tram, bus, vline, nightrider

This will tell you all about the ""location_id"". This includes GPS co-ordinates of the station/stop, the suburb it's in, the lines/route it's on.

[*Sample URL*](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getStopWithIdentifier.php?locationID=1006&amp;transportType=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)

---

**getNextNumberOfTransportsForStops**

*values(req):* stopID, date, time, transportType

*options:* stopID: (not sure yet) || date: in YYYY-MM-DD format (eg, 2012-04-22) || time: in HH%20MM%20PM/AM (eg, **02**%20**18**%20**PM**) ||  transportTypes: train, tram, bus, vline, nightrider

This seems to be the *train's* time table information. StopID doesn't seem to be the same as locationID. If you have the right StopID and time/date/transporttype it'll give you the next few services to run down the line.

[*Sample URL*](http://iphone.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/services/getNextNumberOfTransportsForStops.php?stopID=1029&amp;date=2012-04-22&amp;time=02%2018%20PM&amp;transportType=Train&amp;1.50.20102011)

---

**Note:** As you can see from the end of the sample URLs there's a value of 1.50.20102011, which is what I assume to be the version of the app on the iPhone. Might be worth including it in any calls you make.

---

That's all I've got so far, and I realise the documentation isn't great. The Sample URL's will provide much more information than I can. I'll try to maintain this post if you guys come up with any other information or better ways to display the info. Do what you want with it. Consider this post to be in the public domain. Creative Commons and all that.

And interestingly, the new PTV app seems to encrypt all its data transfers. It passes everything over port 443 to the domain: https://chronos.jimbolos.com.au. That domain is owned by Metlink. This PTV app requires more investigation. It's a pity they're moving to an encrypted web service.

My brother mentioned to me this morning that the Occupy Melbourne protesters are planning to storm Fed Square at noon. I have always loved this city more than any other in the world but these protesters have made me very angry. They are embarrassing and are trivialising an issue that for the US is incredibly serious.

We have it so good here. Our unemployment is low, we have subsidised healthcare, the rich are taxed accordingly and our welfare system is so good it's quite frankly probably a little bit TOO generous. Not only that but Melbourne was recently voted the most liveable city in the world. 

Nobody seems to grasp exactly how localized the 'Occupy' protests really are. In the US corporations all but run sections of government, people have to empty the bank each time they want to see a doctor, unemployment is sky-high, welfare is non-existent, the rich pay minimal tax through exploiting ridiculous loopholes, wages are actually sickening and the distribution of wealth is just awful.

Now that it's developed into violence (somebody mentioned to me the protesters are planning to storm Flinders Street Station today?) I think I'm just going to have to distance myself from identifying with the city I love until everyone gets educated on the issue. Right now this protest is just offensive.

I'll say it now, it's an agency and I know  they aren't to blame, but we've had an absolutely appalling experience with them and I just wanted to let y'all know about our experience. 

Firstly, the equipment he is using? A small 4 channel mixer and 3 discmans. 
Yep, that's right, *discmans*
Secondly, he constantly left his equipment to walk around and talk try and hit on any and all the girls present, leaving the music to either repeat on the CD or just stop playing all together. 
He also didn't prepare ANY of the music tracks that had been requested by the bride herself, including the song for the couples first dance. 
He was also requested to play ""smooth jazz"" while the guests dined. Instead he decided to played Enrique Inglesias and K-Ci and JoJo. 
But what made things worse is that when he finally found a Michael Bublé CD to play, he marched up to THE BRIDE and with a rude and smug smile he stated, ""There! Is that better?!""

Honestly I've never met such a rude, ignorant and unprofessional individual. 


Even though this is a rant, I would just like to let you all know about this because I would hate for something like this to happen to a fellow Redditor, especially on a special day like your wedding.

1371698368.0,116,self.melbourne,1gpcse,An Open Letter to Metro Trains,greasypeace,174,58,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1gpcse/an_open_letter_to_metro_trains/,"Sent to Metro trains:
I would like to relate to you a very upsetting and appalling event that transpired yesterday afternoon on the Parliament end of Platform One, Melbourne Central Station. I arrived at the platform around 4.15pm, to discover that my train, the South Morang 4.16pm had been delayed. Not particularly surprised or concerned, I sat down in the seating area at the end of the platform, surrounded by 10 or so other passengers to await the train.

What transpired next is what my complaint relates to.

A man, approximately 35 – 40, arrived shortly after myself and sat adjacent to me. He proceeded over the next few minutes to make a series of loud shouts, which eventually progressed into him standing up and walking around and yelling out obscenities to no one in particular. 

Quickly this developed as he became fixated on one particular young man who wandered nearby and happened to catch his eye – he then approached him and started to verbally harass and abuse him. The young man eventually wandered away, no doubt wanting to avoid an unpleasant situation. The aggressive man made to follow him – at this point his hostility and language had become worrisome. 

He approached the bench seat that I was sitting on and violently kicked a newspaper between the legs of myself and the other person seated at the other end – when I jumped at the force, he took notice of me and started, very explicitly and aggressively, shouting at me that ‘It hadn’t touched me’ and the like. What followed can only be described as the worst verbal abuse I have even had to endure. I was called things like a ‘a fucking cunt’, a ‘bitch’ etc – the entire group of passengers who were nearby were called ‘filthy fucking skunks’ among other things. As soon as I felt safe to move I got up and walked away, to more swearing and abuse.

Eventually, I noted that four Metro employees had approached the man. As it was over 25 minutes since the 4.16pm South Morang train that never arrived, I had planned to catch the next coming Hurstbridge train and get off at Clifton Hill and walk to my doctors appointment in North Fitzroy, that I would now be late for, however as I glanced at the aggressive man, I saw the four Metro employees talking to him, while he calmly talked back – one employee even smiled at something he said and patted him on the shoulder. 

Angry that this man would get away with being so disgustingly vulgar and abusive to YOUR passengers, myself included, I approached the four employees and explained what had been said by the man, not only to myself but also to the rest of the waiting commuters. Yet I was shocked by the fact that when I tried to talk to the employees I was basically shut down and told to move along. 

I got onto the train and had three other passengers come up to congratulate me on telling the Metro guys what had occurred – one man even told me that when he had observed the aggressive man shouting at me that he himself had gone to get the Metro employees – without him, the aggressive man would have raged on unchecked, and very possibly hurt some one as he was becoming more and more agitated.
My complaint is this – obviously, no-one has any control of what miscreant nut jobs try to catch public transport. 

HOWEVER – Metro trains have a duty of care to ensure their passengers are safe from said nut jobs, especially considering that all of the above mentioned events occurred in full view of not one, but TWO security cameras.
Yesterday, you failed in this duty of care. 

I was very upset at being yelled at and called disgusting things for upwards of 10 minutes, and do not feel very safe about venturing down to platform one again whilst by myself. The levels of mounting aggression displayed the man were frightening; he was walking back and forth, obviously in an violent and forceful way – indeed, everyone who was standing nearby were also afraid. And it took your employees 20 minutes and the request of another passenger to actually take action against the man.
And what action was that? To pat him of the shoulder and have a laugh with him? 
I don’t know what occurred after I got on the train – I don’t know if he was kicked out of the station or let go, yet regardless of that, I am disgusted by the irony that if a passenger forgets or neglects to ‘tap on’ they are committing a crime and subject to a $207 fine, yet an obviously disturbed and violent man is allowed to verbally assault your passengers for upwards of 15 – 20 minutes without any form of protection being offered by your staff. 

I am a 29 year old woman who has lived in Melbourne my whole life and have used public transport for all of my adult life, yet I am looking into alternatives now, as on top of being late for an appointment and having to wait for a train that simply never arrived(certainly not for the first time), I am now fearful for my safety when catching your trains; this is simply unacceptable. 
Why should I pay a hefty price for transport and be scared at the same time, and not be able to trust in your staff to take appropriate action when needed?

I am appalled at the service you provide.

Regards,
greasypeace

1360105806.0,100,self.melbourne,17ynu9,One week in Melb - Observations and Tips,skeezysteev,129,29,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/17ynu9/one_week_in_melb_observations_and_tips/,"It's been one week since I touched down in the Lucky Country and I wanted to share my initial observations for your amusement.  Overall, I love Melbourne so far (I'll love it even more once I'm employed...) so take this post in the good nature it's intended.

- The housing market is cut-throat.  Want a nice apartment or flatshare?  Your ass better be monitoring Gumtree or other sites non-stop.  Things that show up are taken almost immediately so you better pick up the phone and CALL.  If you don't call, by the time your email is read and responded to, it's probably already gone.
-  Every type of coffee is generally $3.50.  Not sure if there is a law about charging different prices for different brews but it seems to me that if I want an espresso, it's $3.50.  Latte? That'll be $3.50.
- Men wear short shorts
- Girls wear big shorts.  Oh the glorious 80s/early 90s high waisted shorts that make asses look huge....
- Women don't seem to give a shit about their hair.  I see all sort of uncombed/ratty female hair here.  Very different from Paris.
- I would describe fashion here as 'failed San Francisco hipster' or 'hipster lite'.  It seems you can generally wear what you want.  I see dressed down thong and t-shirt types alongside well dressed business types.  I like how you can do your own thing.
- Public transport is expensive.  The daily rate is great, but $3.50 for a tram ride?  Come on.  It does seem to come reasonably on time, which is nice.
- Eating out is expensive as hell.  Seriously, take a trip to the US and enjoy eating at gourmet restaurants for less.  I know this is because of high salaries, but $15 for a simple breakfast is insane.
- Alcohol is stupid expensive. Not to beat a dead horse on this one, but $40 for 700ml (the rest of the world does 750ml... why are the bottles 50ml short?) of spirits is crazy.  $5 happy hour specials on pots... that's a special?
- There are many fit ladies here!  According to my girlfriend, there are many fit men here too!
- For as much sun as you get, there are many pasty people here.
- People who drive utes are generally assholes and drive like shit.
- If you're coming on a work and holiday visa and are trying to find a corporate job, you're gonna have a bad time.  I've met with two recruiters already who are super stoked about my CV, only to find out I'm on a work/holiday visa and go into 'I'm so sorry' mode.  I really hope something comes through soon and I don't have to wash dishes :)

Overall I love this city.  It feels like a great place to live.  People seem friendly, it seems pretty safe (to be fair I'm in South Yarra).  Bars and restos look cool, if I can get a job, I'll explore these further.   I see a lot of complaints about transport here.  It seems good to me, but the iPhone apps for transport are well shit with recommending transfers.

Once I get settled, I look forward to meeting you guys and sharing several expensive beers.  I love that you have Sierra Nevada here.. good show Melbourne!",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,False,,,True,t3_17ynu9,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/17ynu9/one_week_in_melb_observations_and_tips/,

Fuck this shit.,beedogs,140,38,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/13ljhs/myki_just_stole_40_from_me_and_theyre_going_to/,"So, here's the deal.  I stupidly set up my Myki card to auto-debit my account when it gets too low, because I readily admit I'm a lazy bastard.

Anyway, earlier this week, my bank called me to tell me my debit card details had been stolen and that they were issuing me a new card.  Not thinking anything of it, and knowing I had about $20 left on my Myki, I got on the train this morning and headed to work.  When I got off the train, I put another $20 on it to cover the next few days' worth of travel, until the new debit card arrives.

Then I got to work and checked my email:

&gt; Your myki money balance has reached the minimum threshold you set previously. However, auto top up was unable to be processed due to your bank account or credit card details not being verified by your bank. **As a result, your myki has been temporarily suspended and is not valid for travel.**

So, okay, it let me get on the train this morning.  And, now, I'm fucked unless I go buy another fucking $6 Myki and put EVEN MORE MONEY onto it.

Fuck this, I called the useless Myki hotline and was told I'd have to **post my card to them** in order to get it unlocked, even though there's $40+ sitting on it right now!  I told the lady to basically get fucked and that I'm planning on fare-evading.  Suck my asshole, Myki.

Very interesting video. By the looks of it it appears that as she was walking home a man was following her and possibly speaking to her (sexual advances would be my guess). As you can see in the video she stops in front of the store, after quickly glancing inside (at the camera?). As she stops the man keeps walking until he is in front of her, which suggests to me that he was bothering her and she was trying to get rid of him, and he makes a hand gesture as if to say ""why not?"" or something to that effect. She then makes her final phone call to a family member. My guess would be that she felt intimidated by this man, and as a result got on the phone to scare him off. A male voice was heard in the background while she was on the phone, so he was likely still bothering her at this stage. Just the fact that she stopped in the doorway of the store suggests to me that she was feeling intimidated and scared.

Anyway, that's my take. Any other thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,1348632524.0,,,True,t3_10hoem,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/10hoem/police_release_cctv_footage_of_gill_meagher/,

Melbourne is one of those places where there's heaps (HEAPS) of great places to find clothing, but unless you know where they are, you'll never find them. Some of my favourite places to shop/bring clients are completely hidden away - such as Somewhere Store and Marais in Royal Arcade.

So here's a quick and easy map that I've used on some of my walking tours in the past, with annotations about what you'll find there and what kind of clothes/price range/notes about the stores themselves.

http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=212561331983691781867.00048503da0dc5b0d7209&amp;msa=0

In list form, some of my favourite places to shop for:

**Suits**

**Godwin Charli** (~$800) for an excellent quality/well-fitted suit, although nowhere near as good as...


**Harrolds** ($1300-$5000)  for fully-canvassed, highest-quality suits that will make you look better than you've ever looked in your life. Don't think I included this one on the map; it's at **101 Collins St**. If you need shirts, their in-house brand (starts with an X, don't remember) is made in the same factory/same fabrics as Dior shirts for about 1/3 the price, around $220 and will do some alterations for you for free so they fit like a dream. Can't speak more highly of this place, plus they give you drinks/whiskey/coffee/etc while you shop. Don't be scared just because it's a high-end place, the staff are amazing (ask for Julian if he's there) and there are quite a few reasonably-priced things there.

**Casual**

**Plane** (Manchester Lane) is by far my favourite place for casual stuff in Melbourne. Prices are ridiculously good for what you get ($15 for great quality/cuts in basic t-shirts, $80 chinos, $25 wallets, $80 casual shirts etc). Decent shoes and sunglasses and accessories too.

**Somewhere Store** (Royal Arcade) is a close second on my favourites, hidden up a staircase in Royal Arcade (near Little Collins St), full of Swedish clothes that have minimalistic/clean/functional designs. *The* place to go if you want an assortment of Dr Denim, Cheap Monday, Tiger and other Swedish stuff. The owner, Gustaf, is a gentleman and a scholar. Heaps of jeans, chinos, shirts, tees, jumpers, jackets, accessories etc. Great place to bring girls.

**Incu** (Flinders Lane) is another of my favourites. A streetwear-style store, similar to what you'll find in FAT but with a lot more variety/better range of stuff. A wide range of watches, cameras, sunglasses, accessories and whatnot as well. Absolutely love this store.

**Jeans**

**Nudie** (Lt. Collins St) make probably my favourite jeans in the world. Great cuts, fantastic quality and decent prices for what you get (around $200 for a pair). 

**Acne** (GPO) again, similar Swedish-made denim in great cuts/colours/etc.

**Somewhere Store** (Royal Arcade) and FAT (GPO) for Cheap Mondays ($90), Dr Denim ($140) and other well-priced jeans.

**Shoes**

**Luisa Uomo** (161 Collins St, inside, opposite the food court) is the absolute first port of call when buying shoes. Ever bought a pair of shoes from Aquila/Florsheim/etc, worn it for a few months and then they fall apart? That's because the quality is crappy, the soles are glued on and the leather is cheap. Overpriced for what you get. Instead, get a good pair of hand-made shoes, high-quality construction and attention to detail that will last for years. Traditionally these shoes will cost $400-$1000+. Luisa Uomo is great because it's the discount store of Luisa (on Russell St) that sell European shoes like Armani, Church, Loakes etc. At the end of each season all the stock goes to Uomo and are discounted 50-80%. Stock changes constantly and it can be difficult to find things in your size, but always check it out to see if you can find a bargain. If you can find a pair of Churches for &lt;$400, **BUY THEM**, as they will last 10+ years. Honest. Hold them in your hands, you can feel the construction/material quality.

**RM Williams** (Collins St) - The place to go if you want a pair of Chelsea Boots. They'll set you back ~$390, but again, they'll last for 5-10+ years.

**Plane, Incu, Milu** are good places to go for cheaper/casual shoes. These won't last as long, obviously, and aren't formal (not that dress shoes can't be worn casually - right now I'm wearing black jeans with a pair of Loake brogues). Shoes in the $80-$200 range.

*Remember, when buying shoes, never, ever get a square toe or a pointy toe. Round, almond, etc-shaped toes are classic and are really the only style that looks good*. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the map linked above for the rest of my recommended stores, there are a few for different styles (e.g. Claude Maus and Trimapee for a darker/drapy/edgier style, Sure Store for streetwear and so on). The ones I've listed here are just some of my favourites.

This is only the CBD (and there are many new ones that have popped up since I made the map) but this should be more than enough to get you away from the crappiness of Tarocash, YD, Roger David and their overpriced-and-underdesigned-counterparts.",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,1350450543.0,,,True,t3_komt6,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/komt6/gents_a_guide_on_where_to_shop_for_clothes_in/,

I googled it and was met with the most bizarre review I have ever read. You can find it here. 

Source: http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/dr-follicles-barber-shop-fitzroy

**I have pasted it below**

*I'd like to share a story with you guys.

Once, in my youthful travels abroad, I found myself in Bangkok, in need of a haircut. Those of you whom have sojourned to Siam will probably know that the weather is quite often ""shit"" and ""hot"", so I felt the need to shed my lords of dogtown mane to cool the fuck down.

I was perspiring on the balcony of the seedy hostel that was my domicile at the time, when I noticed across the road a small barber shop- really just a tiled hole in a wall with a barber seat attended by a guy who could have passed for the thai rick james. I carefully peeled myself from the pleather lounge I was melting into and dragged myself down the stairs and across the road to have me barnet cut, waked in the door, sawat dee bro, let's get a haircut happening, and sat down.

Now, what you need to understand about Thai people is that they keep all of the fucks they have to give in the middle of an island called ko phi phi don, which is sort of east of Phuket, which is where your seedy sex tourist uncle goes on holiday. Anyway, the island is totally empty. Thai people give literally zero fucks. I'll write a list for you of the fucks that Thais give:

-
-
-
-
-Sanuk

As you can see, no fucks to give at all- Apart from sanuk. Sanuk is this awesome concept Thai people have that pretty much means everything should be at least a little bit fun. You combine these together with the fact that most industries in thailand are more or less unregulated, and you end up with a place where people don't really gaf about much more then making sure they're having a good time.

The barber shop I'm talking about here was a pretty good example of this Thai zeigeist. Zero effort in presentation, hot as fuck, stinks, and shitty english. As I sat down and attempted to make what I wanted done with my hair understood by Aroon or Kasem or whatever my would-be hairdressers name was, I realised I was fucked.

Now, when I'm abroad I prescribe to the traditional British multilingual method (BMM). When an Englishman desires to make oneself understood by a native, learning secondary and tertiary languages is unnecessary- just say what you want louder, slower, and with more inflection. Guaranteed 100% to work (eventually) every time. After gesticulating and shouting for a good five minutes I felt that my point had made it across the lingual gap, and we were ready to begin the haircut.

My erstwhile barber then proceeded to whip out a pair of battered clippers and shear my head like a sheep. Fucking A. After the inital shock of losing almost a year's worth of hair I accepted my fate, and realised I was beyond caring. I started thinking about what I was going to do to inject a little sanuk into this second-rate fawlty towers skit that was playing out through the mirror in front of me. I sat for some time cogitating on this when the barber promptly completed the complete shaving of my head and turned to face me.
""You wan nails done?"" He asked in shattered english. Why the fuck not? I was already bald, I may as well have some shiny damn nails as well. Footstools and a short thai girl were arranged, and suddenly my nails were groomed and gleaming. 
""You wan face done?"" Aroon/Kasem asked me again, which rather seemed par for the course at this stage. A quick shave later left me reclining in the chair with a towel around my neck and goo all over my face in a tiled hole in the wall on a 35 degree humid day in fucking Bangkok. Great stuff, having a fucking sanuk time right there, I was.

After an eternity of sweaty torment my tonsorial jailer deemed it suitable to let me go and settle my bill. As I was reaching into my pocket for some grimy baht my coiffeur leaned conspiratorially toward me and leered ""You wan massage?"" with a wink.
""Not from you, ace"", I replied- to which he advised that no, the massages actually take place upstairs. Having come this far and not wanting to bitch out, I went for the optional massage. 

I'm sure some of you have seen the inside of a dodgy massage parlor. Those of you that haven't can just paint yourselves a picture with your imagination brush. The point here is that I went upstairs, had my massage on top of everything else, and it ended exactly as most thai massages end.

It was the best damn haircut of my life.

Now that I've explained this story to you, I want you to appreciate how awesome that haircut would have been for me. I want you to visualise the concept of how glorious and awesome such a haircut would be. Now that you're holding this concept in your head, I want you to think of the exact antithesis of this haircut. I want you to imagine the shittest, most awful, terrible, haircut you can conceive of. Now that you can imagine this festering shit of a haircut, you can grasp the general idea of how my haircut at Dr Follicles was.

The first one happened on the Sunbury line.  A young guy, maybe mid-20s (and probably drug affected) said something to me.  I had my iPod going and head in the paper, so I didn't hear him.  When I asked him what he'd said I got a rather blunt response: ""I said give me ten fuckin' bucks"".  Needless to say he got a no.

Later on, I was on the the train heading out towards Pakenham and an older bloke sat opposite.  ""Excuse me - if I told you a joke that made you laugh, do you think you could spare a dollar or two so I can eat tonight?"".

Gotta be honest, I was shocked by this, but pleased that he was putting in a little effort.  So I said yes.  

""Why should you always date a homeless girl?"".

"".... no idea"".

""Because it's so much easier to get her to stay the night!""

I gave him $20.  

Had a chat with him briefly and his view is that if he has to resort to asking strangers for help, he may as well work for it.  He reckons that we work for our money, and he should be no different.

I've encountered him 4x already, twice when I was alone around Kings x Collins St and last night around 2am at Melb Central when I was walking back with a bunch of mates. He didn't recognise me and gave the same shit story. I've also seen him outside Southern Cross talking to some Asian students who handed him money.

1360539192.0,87,self.melbourne,189utm,Are you a myki-using android-phone owner? Here's a tip that may be useful.,lordshaker,102,15,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/189utm/are_you_a_mykiusing_androidphone_owner_heres_a/,"First a disclaimer: I'm in no way associated with these apps, but I have found the following set up pretty handy for checking my balance on the go, without needing to go to the frakking terrible myki site and messing around with that laborious pin entry. Plus it impresses people! Maybe!

You will need:

* a NFC enabled android phone (fairly recent Samsung, LG, Sony etc); check the settings on your phone if you're not sure.
* [This myUsage](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cmengler.myusagelite&amp;hl=en) app: link here is to the free version, with the restriction of only hooking up one account. I think the developer is an aussie, so check out the supported accounts the full app offers, there's a bunch of them.
* [This AnyTag NFC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anytag.android&amp;hl=en) app, which allows you to re-appropriate any NFC chip to do whatever you want (within reason).



**SETTING UP MYUSAGE:** Start the app, and press the '+' symbol to add an account. myki is found under 'Travel'. There's a one-time log in, and then your balance should appear on the main page. You can (and may need to) hit the refresh button when the app launches.



**SETTING UP ANYTAG:** Hover your phone over your myki card. AnyTag will launch, asking if you would like to configure the NFC tag it has found. Name the tag 'myki' or similar, then press '+' to add an *intent*. Here you're going to add the *Activity* for MyUsage (called com.mengler.myusage....). Depending on how many apps you have, it may be quite far down the list.

And that's it! Now whenever you dangle your phone over your myki card, your balance will appear. Don't forget you may need to refresh to see the most recent balance though.

If this seems exciting and you're not terribly confused, you may be interested in using this technique to utilise all the other NFC tags around these days. I've got a similar set up for scanning my eftpos card to launch a browser with my bank log-in page, and scanning my passport puts my phone into airplane mode, for instance.

But you guys were quite honestly the best and funnest crowd we have had of that size. Letting us know when people were doing stuff they shouldn't and not respecting the venue, giving us the heads up when glasses broke and just generally listening when you were told not to do something (like drink outside). I had an amazing night tonight. Yes it was frustrating for me to be stuck behind the bar and not be able to chat to many of you, but to those I did - it was a pleasure to meet you all.
In answer to the rumours of a pool regarding whether I am in fact gay or straight hahaha, I'm straight. So those who misjudged me, Ha! All in fun though.

I know which shops are good, which are overpriced, how particular brands' clothes are constructed and which clothes will last a long time.

I hate seeing people waste money on clothes. Guys will spend $200 on a pair of glued-together shoes that only last 6 months, when they could have spent $250 (or cheaper, depending on if you go to the right places) on one that is Goodyear welted and will last for 5 years. They'll buy $230 Rhodes and Beckett shirts when they could get one made-to-measure by the best tailor in Melbourne for $240. They shop at places like Tarocash and YD which have expensive, poorly made clothes with a tacky design.

Just thought I'd extend an invitation - if you ever have any questions about where to shop, what brands are good, whether one item is actually worth the price, just send me an email at info@agoodman.com.au or use the simple contact form on [our website](http://agoodman.com.au). Comes straight through to my mobile and I can help you out straight away.

**ALSO**, This Saturday and Sunday, I'm doing a private sale with Swensk, one of our favourite stores in Melbourne. Really great Swedish clothes, minimalistic designs, great for building up a base wardrobe. They're giving our clients 50% off. I don't get commission on anything you buy (ever!), but my business partner and I are being paid to be there and hang out. Especially good for overweight guys, they have some of the best pants for big guys that I've ever seen.

So even if you don't want to buy anything, please feel free to come down, meet us, we're always happy to give on-the-spot style advice and give you ideas on what to where/where to shop. If you would like to come, just shoot us an email (info@agoodman.com.au) with what time you're coming down as we're gonna be in and out all day.

Feel free to AMA here as well.

Some friends of mine in Ballarat are part of a charity group called ""Khmer Rode Rage"" who over the last 12 months raised $15,000 for an orphanage in Cambodia, while at the same time raising awareness of climate change and promoting environmentally sustainable transport and lifestyles.

The school in Bacchus Marsh who agreed to assist them with their business operations such as taking payments and donations, have seized the $15k intended for the orphanage and are asserting that they are the rightful owners of the money.

This is particularly distressing for the group, as they visited the orphanage in January and have built personal relationships with the kids, and have seen first hand the absolute poverty in which these children live.

As Khmer is a charitable organisation, they don't have the funds to pursue legal action to ensure the money goes to Cambodia.  

If anyone is, or knows of a kind-hearted lawyer who may be able to provide some guidance for them, please pm me or comment below and I will put you in touch with their organiser.

Their website is here, which has information about their recent trip to Cambodia and other fundraising efforts: http://roderage.com.au/khmer/

Thanks everyone.

Edit: The organiser has contacted a community legal service, but his appointment is weeks away. He worries that the school may spend the money in the mean time, making it near impossible to recover.

Edit 2 (10:45am Friday): Hi guys, a helpful lawyer who saw this post advised not to contact the media until KRR have had proper legal advice.

",BearPond,112,38,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/swhuj/26_years_of_using_tickets_no_issue_one_day_of/,"First things first: I've never evaded train fare in my life. I catch it daily - no car - and had never been fined. 

Last Saturday I bought a myki because they wouldn't sell metcards. 

Sunday arvo. I go to the bus stop near my house, catch it five minutes to Lilydale station, and hop off. I REMEMBERED to touch off the bus, and was fairly chuffed with myself, because I was reminding myself over and over cos I'm really not very good at that kind of stuff.

Then I hopped on the train, got it to Flinders, and coming through the exit gate it didn't work - I'd forgotten to touch on at Lilydale train station. 

The gatekeeper opened the gate for me and asked me to go through and talk to ""those guys"", who turned out to be inspectors. I said to them, ""I forgot to touch on I suppose, although I used it in Lilydale, so shouldn't it be able to know where I've come from?""

They took it off me, looked on their gadget, and told me I'd used it for ten minutes in Lilydale, about an hour ago. 

""Yes.""

""And now you are here, but it only has a zone 3 ticket. It doesn't know how you got here.""

*Confused look. ""I got the train here... I must have forgotten to touch on the train, so can you adjust the ticket so it covers this trip?""

Long story short - the answer was no, they couldn't adjust the ticket to remedy my mistake. The only possible way to fix my honest mistake was to acuse me of evading train fare and issue me a fine in the mail, which I can contest when it arrives. 

So I'm not going to get the trains any more I don't think. It's back to the unsafe roads for me. I guess I'd better pop over to r/cars and start browsing for a new ride!

I owe Myki a massive debt.  Ever since I first got a car, my exercise level has dropped.  Now in an office job, the 9-5 grind consumes enough time and effort to make getting off the couch once I get home something I really need to push myself to do.  Yeah, I started to suffer from ""too many pies""-itis and my pant size grew.

Because I loathe the Myki system so much, I refuse to yield.  I will not play ball with the muppets who built such a shoddy system when Metcard still works better.  I bought a bike.

So now, I've discovered that there is this [network of car-free areas](http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/Moreinfoandservices/Bicycles/BicycleMaps/DownloadableBicycleMaps.htm), and my mates have started riding too, and we ride mountain bikes on weekends, and I'm getting exercise and everything!  And awesomely, I don't need to wait for Metro's delayed (or cancelled) and crowded trains, and I never need to swipe some stupid, defective bit of plastic or complain to the even more defective droolers at Myki support when they make an error.

So thank you, Myki.  If you weren't so bad, I wouldn't have had the impetus to get on the bike, and I'd still be getting fatter.  You rock.

1363818357.0,75,self.melbourne,1aoyjl,I believe Myki are ripping off customers with a dodgy pass system,soulblade64,95,20,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1aoyjl/i_believe_myki_are_ripping_off_customers_with_a/,"I bought a 38 day pass for Zone 1 travel on Myki.

I activated it on the 19th of March, it should cover me for travel all the way up to and including the 25th of April.

The problem, my pass expires at 3am on the 25th of April... 3am!

I have done the counts a dozen times, 38 days, from the 19th of March (including the 19th of March as number 1) should grant me to use my pass on the 25th of April, a task I will be unable to do because it expires at 3am.

I have contacted Myki and they said my 38 day pass expires at the correct time, but I believe they're skimming one day off passes and hoping no-one would notice. I have asked them to clarify why my 38 day pass can only effectively be used for 37 days of travel, I am still waiting for an answer.

Has anyone else noticed this, or can provide an explanation as to why my 38 day pass only appears valid for travel for 37 days?

EDIT: It would seem this is a problem affecting other people, and others are suggesting it's just a display problem.

To further clarify on what /u/SiriusBlack01 is saying, it's entirely possible that after I travelled in the morning of the 18th using Myki Money then purchased my 38 day pass online at around 2pm on the 18th, my 38 day pass has actually activated on my afternoon trip home on the 18th when I was expecting it to use Money. I did however have an email from Myki stating my pass was activated on the 19th. This is also a scam on commuters as well, as I was charged a whole day when I should have been charged for a 2 hour trip, and it looks like I will have to claime a refund for my morning trip on the 18th (I have had this happen in the past, I topped up my Myki at 6pm on a Sunday, on Monday morning my commute came out of Money and my afternoon trip activated the pass, therefore charging me $7.80 rather than $7 for the day in Money or $4.30 for the day with the Pass)

EDIT2: I have taken a closer look at my transactions on the Myki website, it turns out my pass DID activate on my commute home on the 18th of March. I am still going to file a complaint with the Ombudsmen as this is a flaw in their system that is overcharging people. I have been charged $7.80 in total for the days travel, when the maximum I can be charged using Myki Money is $7 and the max I can be charged using a monthly pass is $4.30.",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,1363914401.0,,,True,t3_1aoyjl,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1aoyjl/i_believe_myki_are_ripping_off_customers_with_a/,

These are just things that stood out to me and may be of not importance at all.

**Undercover Train Officers** - In Perth, ours aren't plain clothes and wear high-vis vests.  In Melbourne the first one I saw dressed like a detroit detective for some reason and even had the shiny badge hanging around his neck in that manner.  They all seem to be wearing the same kind of shoes.  The police use the same issue and it gives away their role as a train officer.


**High haircuts** - All the ""cool kids"" (maybe 21 years old?) had them.  Like people put their fingers in a light socket then shaved the sides.

**Cute Birds** - At food places like McDonalds, Nandos, Subway etc. there's these cute sparrows that bounce around like little ping pong balls with tooth pick legs. As I type this, their tweeting is becoming quite annoying.  The Minah Birds (?) were pretty by comparison to the Perth pigeons and brown doves, but the bastards pulled all my rubbish out of the wheelie bin and distributed it nicely through my yard.  Assholes.  

**Fancy Bus Stops** - The suburb I'm in has a bus stop with an LED sign showing the route and name of the stop.  There's even a little button that I'm assuming plays a recorded message of the arrival time.  In Perth, you get an orange pole cemented into the ground.  If you're lucky, you get a seat with a roof over it and some walls.  Usually all the timetable stickers are ripped off and the advertising windows smashed leaving glass all over the place.

**Tiny Beer** - Some places don't sell pints.  WTF?

**No Fun** - There appears to be no toy shops or piss poor toy sections at Myers/David Jones.  Are there no children here?  Did an evil wizard take them all?

Motorcycles Everywhere - There's a lot more motorcycles here than in Perth, but that's probably because parking is non existent.  Can you just park these anywhere on the sidewalk?  Do you need to buy a ticket?  Also, they seem to be $2,000 cheaper than Perth

**The Myki Cards for Trains** - In Perth we have a similar card, though the name escapes me.  When you get on a train or bus, you ""Tag On"" and ""Tag Off"" when getting off.  Myki uses the terms ""Touch On"" and ""Touch Off"" which sounds a little like I'm getting intimate with the card readers.  The system here is also a little slower to register the card, but I noticed this varies with time of day/week so it might be a data traffic issue.

**No natives** - I don't mean to sound racist (I'm not) but there are no aboriginals that I've seen.

**EDIT:**  I'm stuck using a mobile phone for internet access until they hook the net up at my place, so I'm sorry if my replies take a while or I disappear

**EDIT 2 - SHAMELESS PLUG:** I didn't create this post for this, but my housemate insists I should add this.  I'm currently looking for a new job, so if you know anyone in need of someone with an IT background (I've done everything from hardware and software repair to network design/admin and IT Manager and my most recent was managing the IT for Western Australia for a fuel/oil company) PM me please.

I spoke to a man that called Tony Abbott ""hitler in clergy robes"". Another called the Anzus treaty international sovereign slavery. I met a lady who told me that the world must submit to socialism or else no one will have any money. Another called me a bastard and a villain when I said I dismissed a casual worker for being crap at his job under workchoices.

There were others - rational people arguing for a carbon tax, and the humane treatment of refugees. I agreed with those people, because they seemed to understand that the government is not a charity. It's a body that works to provide citizens land rights, uphold freedom, protect those citizens, and facilitate the ability to pursue happiness. 

There is a fundamental disconnect here. Australia is not America. We must be fighting for an Australian cause, not an American one. We need to stimulate personal involvement in politics, and keep our government accountable, productive, sustainable and humane.

A 3-group custom painted pearl white Slayer Espresso Machine and matching Robur grinder were stolen from a shop that was supposed to open this week. Be on the lookout for shady characters trying to sell this stolen equipment. (x-post from r/coffee),llathrop,84,11,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/1cuo7n/attn_melbourne_baristascoffee_fans_a_3group/,"I posted this earlier in r/coffee and someone recommended I share it with you guys as well. I'm an American barista who works for a shop with one of these same machines. They are expensive, huge, heavy, and extremely unique. It's not the kind of thing that someone will just be able to drop off at a pawn shop for pocket change, so I figure that the more people who know about it, the better. Help spread the word and maybe we can get this shop their equipment back.

This is what Coffee Supreme in Melbourne had to say:

""Last night a new cafe of ours had their machine and grinder stolen. A three group Slayer, custom painted pearl white with timers, hot water and some other custom mods. A custom painted pearl white Robur grinder with custom timer and start switch, was also stolen. Both of these machines are basically unique.

The serial numbers are; Slayer #0187 Robur dosing grinder #1140424

Please, if anyone hears of these machines coming up on the ""market"" get in touch with us or the police, as they have been reported stolen. The equipment was stolen from Adney Milk Bar in Kew, two days before they are due to open.
Please share this through your networks.""

Yesterday I returned to my car after 5pm to find the back rego plate had been stolen. This morning I saw a very nice black BMW (possibly Audi or Merc - I'm not great at cars) with it's drivers side window smashed in. And there was a super dodgy looking dude in the area; he kept moving slowly past cars, looking in the windows, and I even saw him briefly enter into a property that was being renovated - he had that junkie look about him so my guess is he was looking for easy stuff to pinch.

I reported the rego plate thing to the police yesterday afternoon and they dusted for prints but didn't find anything. I also called the police this morning to tell them about the dodgy guy. 

So this is a bit of PSA to just be aware if you live or park in the area that there's a total arsehat wandering around knicking stuff and possibly breaking into cars. And if you see anyone suspicious please call Prahran police station on 9520-5200.

This weekend is Chinese New Year and I'm away from my family. 

I'm far away doing something I love - Bartending. 

Working downstairs@Bluestone is pretty quiet/relaxed, with just me and another guy handling the floor and downstairs lounge bar ([The guys upstairs have a thing on Urbanspoon](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/760226/restaurant/CBD/Bluestone-Restaurant-Melbourne)). 

Located down the less trendy side of Flinder's Lane (corner of Flinder's Lane and Bond St), I like the peace and quiet. Not too busy, not too quiet.

People come downstairs for dinner (pizzas/tapas,etc) but most patrons sit down to eat/chill on the couches. My bar bench is often barren of good conversation. 

I'm not promoting my workplace and I'm not begging for pity. I'd just like friends. Seriously. I need someone to sit at the bar on Chinese New Year while I work. I'm suppose have dinner with family but since I'm not, you will be my new family. We can sing songs, tell stories and talk philosophy/politics/bullshit. A ""You win, I win"" sorta thing.

So yes, Navi (that's me) has an offer;

If you have a date, I'll be your wingman. We do pretty good food here so that's nice. Make sure to sit at the bar and I'll try to make you look good, bro.

If you're by yourself, come by and have a beer/whiskey. Heck, if you're not drunk and being a cool person, I'll drink with you. No alcohol while I work. I drink cups of tea. No pinky finger extended. Yeah, that's how I roll.

Sad stories and bad days are acceptable but no crying. Drink up. I'll offer convalescence. 

If you're a hot chick, that's nice but good conversation is important. From past experiences, close-ended questions like *""Do you like dragons?""* or *""OMG! What's this drink called?""* make me uncomfortable. 

Yes, I love dragons.

No, this drink doesn't have a name, per say. It's Gin and Juice. With a lime.

I'm not one of those *good-with-the-ladies* kinda bartenders. I don't know how to flirt and I instinctively ERMAHGERD in ALL my photos.

I'm a *beverage-nerd-with-tattoos-working-downstairs-of-a-fine-dining-place* kinda bartender. I can tell you about the tannins in your whiskey and the type of grain in your vodka. Traditionally, cocktails ought to have bitters. Truth be told, everything tastes the same when you're drunk. And finally, wines suck...or more precisely, I don't get it. 

If you drink whiskey and cola, please don't waste your money ordering top shelf whiskey. Sir, I'm happy to pour the drink but you'll get more enjoyment with two drinks of the house whiskey and I added some sugar and/or bitters. Plus, it's cheaper.

My first Reddit post. Hopefully, something cool will happen this weekend while I work.

Thanks guys/gals. Stay hydrated.

*EDIT*: The responses have been so amazing!! Sadly, my boss called and I've been taken off the shift. The place is quiet, I suppose. they have Happy Hour fridays there so I wanted to give you guys drink there for value but still, head down if you guys want. But, tomorrow Saturday I'll be working AND it's actual Chinese New Year Eve. Come tomorrow, guys!!

at the moment, it's looking as if the first photo will be posted at 5:15 ish.
It will be in the CBD, and easily accessable from the loop. if i venture outside thw CBD, ill let you know.

 Depending on the feedback from the photos, I'll either give you a clue or post another. the longer you take, the more obvious of a photo I will upload.

i have no idea how many of these i will do, it
depends on how it goes I guess.

I will try and leave something at my location to let you know I am there. it will most likely be a drawing. however this may not be possible as the night goes on.

once you think you know who I am, you can approach me. Please do not ask me ""when the narwhal bacons"", I'm sorry but I think it's stupid. instead ask me for the time, directions, ect; what ever. if the response ""sorry, I'm all out"", congratulations.
you just won a drink.

only the first person to find me will get a drink. I will try and
move locations as often as possible.

this event is about having fun. see some of you soon..... or will I


p.s. if you wish to know any further details, just ask.

Today alone I had 3 bad experiences -

1. I was on the far left of a shared bike/pedestrian lane, and someone was overtaking me, the guy coking the other direction had his entire lane still but yelled fiercely at the guy overtaking me to ""get the fuck out of the way you fuckhead""

2. I was riding up a bridge, again a shared lane, and I was overtaking a slow person...and a guy coming downhill going extremely fast started screaming at me telling me to fuck myself...we weren't even close to colliding...he had his lane!

3. Behind in a line of people waiting to cross the road...a girl coming the other direction got really mad at the line of people crossing shouting to ""keep left"", there was room to cross!

And recently I've had someone in their most uppity voice asking ""should you even be here"" on a shared lane,in this case I wasn't even near that lady she was just pissy that there we're people riding...

Finally I was crossing at a legit crossing and one guy doesn't slow down in his car and just passes literally 4cm away from my front wheel and gives me the finger and says ""fuck you""


All this and the fact that a lot of bike lanes just start and end in the middle of nowhere or go past parked cars or with fast traffic has sadly tarnished the whole experience.

The last photo he uploaded to Facebook was of this pier near St Kilda, and his last post was a very worrying 'Goodnight Australia. I tried as hard as I could. I love you. Please forgive me.'

Dozens of people are trying to get in contact with him to no avail. If you see him PLEASE PM me and let me know where he is. I have only known him a fraction of the time I want to and just want to let everyone know he's okay.

I don't understand why people congregate in front of the doors and are afraid to walk further into the train to allow room for more people. There was no reason for anyone to be left behind but people were either mindless or stubborn. Meanwhile, there are Metro employees directing people in and out of the train which is pretty pathetic in its own right; honestly, I think it's a joke that Metro riders need to be directed on how to allow more people on a train...

Your coffee in Melbourne is amazing almost anywhere and you have no excuse. So wake up and be considerate during your morning commute. No one wants to be there but we all have to so if we can make it easier, just do it and help facilitate a smoother ride for everyone.

This includes babe-in-arms also. The owner, Rob, has posted today that one patron has gone as far as to actually contact an Age journalist about the ""issue"". 

Personally, as a father of an eight month old, I have no intention of ever taking her to any kind of bar or pub. I don't see how I could enjoy my night knowing that it's possible my child could be an absolute grumble bum and just make people feel uncomfortable or irritable. 

If I go to Raccoon, I either get the grandparents to look after her for a couple of hours, or my wife just wants to relax at home so she takes care of the kid.

What I don't understand is, why would someone complain about the house rule when it is clearly shown at the entrance, and is kindly enforced. Is it that the person gets embarrassed? Is it that all-to-often vocal trait of them feeling they have been targeted and ""punished for having kids""? Maybe they dont want to resort to the junction pub down the road because they want to go to the cool place that has people there that seem to have forgotten to get off the tram in thornburry. It just seems really odd that someone would go that far as to make such a fuss that they'd actually go to The Age to complain (which I'm sure was decided because they were above going to the likes of ACA).

The article is apparently going to be in tomorrows Age, unsure what page, all I know is it is one of those journo-choice ones where they get to create divides in the population for a couple of days.

I post this to /r/Melbourne only because they place is a local, and one of the best little locals in the northern suburbs (by my opinion). It's a shame that there are people out there that insist on breaking balls.

Time to let your hair down, folks. Come along and join us at Beer Deluxe for an end of year gathering on Friday December 7th. Last year there was a great turn out and this year we are hoping to make it even better.

Pencil this into your calendar and come along for a great night of social intercourse and beverage consumption. SAP's welcome.

EDIT 2: But sadly for you (though happily for somebody else) the lappy is taken. I'll see what else I have lying around.

I have a Toshiba Portege R100 lying around. It's my favourite ever laptop, but I use my other one more often.

It's got 1.25GB RAM, a 16GB SSD and an external clip on battery. Not sure of the battery life, sorry. In these modern times it's mainly let down by it's processor - a 1GHz Intel ULV jobbie.

The reason I say it's not for everybody is simple - it's running Crunchbang Linux, it has a tiny SSD, and getting Windows on there is by all accounts a complete pain in the arse. It uses the same hard drive type as the earlier ipods, so they can be expensive. The SSD makes it pretty snappy, however.

That said, it's freely available to anybody who needs a simple word processor and browser - and it's all yours. I would much rather see this go to a needy student then a hobbyist, to be honest.

Scope [this link](http://electronicrandomness.blogspot.com.au/2008/02/toshiba-portege-r100-upgrade-and.html) for more info. It's not me, but the comments and article are handy.

So here's the plan:

~1pm: We're doing a bit of a picnic thing at Flagstaff Gardens! We'll be meeting about [here](http://goo.gl/maps/DYrL) with the tables and chairs. This part of the day is ALL AGES! COME! BRING FOODS! WEAR REALLY WARM CLOTHES 'COS [DAMN.](http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/melbourne.shtml) If it's raining, I have absolutely no idea what we'll do. Any suggestions for a plan B? I think we'll be just fine, personally.

~7pm: Make your way to [Softbelly!](http://goo.gl/maps/YZXQ) YAY INDOORS! Also: Reasonably priced drinks! Music! Optional Dancing! Optional LOUNGING! MANDATORY SOCIALISING! It's going to be a BLAST. I've booked out the back room entirely so you can come in and say ""Hi! I'm a redditor!"" and no one will be all ""Huh?""! On the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/381518638566546/) we have *120* people down as coming (Not even counting the maybes!) so we'll have to spill in to the front bar (and if stuff gets *really* crazy we might have to trickle in to a nearby bar).

If you're particularly SAPy, and too nervous to talk to a random stranger, keep an eye out for one of our official Penguin Herders. They'll have some very fancy lanyard ID things that are basically signs that say ""HEY! COME TALK TO ME!"" They'll help introduce you to people and get the conversation ball rollin'.

Guys, this is it, this is the big one. It's going to be *amazing*, you're going to have so much fun, you're going to meet so many awesome people, and if you're particularly spectacular *you'll dance like a maniac*.

I am an American. I left Australia from Cairns at about 5:30 AM last night, and went to the Cairns airport at about 3:30. Now, at around 2 AM, I had the absolute greatest moment of my life when I met a girl at a place called the Woolshed. Neither of us were really the type of people to go to clubs/bars and both happened to be there just killing some time. She approached me because she had seen me sitting alone for about 10 minutes prior to approaching me. We got to talking and she asked me if I danced. So we danced. Neither of us were really into the music or the dance scene and we ended up doing what I'm sure was a terrible dance to anyone watching but the cutest thing to me with us twirling each other around. 

Anyways, after some dancing she told me she had to find her friend, so I assumed that was it. She asked me to come with her though so I did. We walked around together and were holding hands and touching each other as we walked and it all felt so natural, with her being the lead and doing most of the touching. I've never ever felt a connection like this with someone, certainly not so soon after meeting them. 

So we find her friend then go off on our own again and we just talk and talk. She has something to do early in the morning and I have a flight to catch in less than an hour. So the night comes to and end. She has me take out my phone and I use the inkpad app on it to let her type something in. She gives me her number, her e-mail, and other info. I get my phone back and after a bit more talking, we share a long hug and then I get the courage to ask her if we could kiss. As soon as I asked she went in for it like she'd been waiting for me to mention it forever and we had a really great kissing scene straight out of a cheesy romance movie. We then hugged again and went outside where we met with her friends and she told me she wouldn't have access to her phone for about 5 weeks and I told her I'd e-mail her. 

So I walk back to my hostel happier than I've honestly ever been in my life. Everything was just so perfect, she was such a nice, sweet girl. 

So, as I'm walking my phone is vibrating a bit, I assume it's my alarm for the morning going off and ignore it. I get back to my hostel, check my phone so I can copy down her info to paper and I see that I have lost EVERYTHING. When my phone was in my pocket the inkpad app was still open and I had written random letters and stuff everywhere and erased what she had typed. I'll be honest, I nearly cried. 

I'm back in the US now, and desparate to get back in touch with her. She is ALSO from the US, from the state of Oregon. She told me she was in Cairns until Sunday and that she was studying Nursing in Melbourne. Her name is Kimberly but I think she often goes by just Kim. 

So if anyone knows her or knows of her, please message me! If there are any other subreddits that would be a better help, please, let me know! Not only do I want to contact her again for my own desire to keep in touch with her, but I also don't want her to expect me to contact her and then think that I wasn't serious about her and had no intentions of keeping in touch when of course she never gets anything from me because I lost all of her information. 

tl;dr- I connected with a girl from Oregon (US) who is currently in Australia studying nursing in Melbourne, but is with some girlfriends in Cairns until sunday. She gave me all of her contact information in my phone but I typed over it while the phone was in my pocket and can't recover it. If you know a girl named Kimberly who is from the US and studying in Melbourne, please message me.

At about 12:15am this morning I got off the train at Seddon station to make my way home from a friends 21st. After getting off the train I began walking down Pentiland Parade, so I could go down Charles street.

Halfway down to parade I could hear two people walking behind me. They were moving faster than I was, though I didn't think too much of it. One called out to me, asking if I knew the time. I don't own a phone and was dressed up at the time (costume party), meaning I had no pockets and all my stuff was in a backpack. I called out to him that it was quarter past 12, since that was the time my train had pulled in.

At this they started walking faster, and I sped up in response, now somewhat nervous. I turned onto Charles, and now they had caught up with me. The two were obviously young, around 15-18. The boy who'd called out (Around 170cm, black) began walking beside me, and his friend (160cm-ish, white) directly behind. I was told to stop, but continued without acknowledging them. The taller one pushed me slightly, and asked me where my phone and wallet were. At this, he took something from his own pocket; Because of my glasses and the dim light, I couldn't identify what it was.

The one behind me now had a hand on my bag; in response I swung an arm out from the strap and rested it under my other arm, giving me a better grip on it and allowing me to drop it if I felt really threatened. The one beside me said I had 5 to stop. 4. 3. 2. I stopped and rested my hand on a gate, and told the kid I was stopping, because now I was home.

The kid behind me, still trying to hold my bag, now told me to let them take it, and pulled. I laughed (nervous as hell, though not showing it) and told him it wasn't worth the hassle I'd give him, then asked if their parents knew what they were doing. The black kid then hit me across the back of the neck with his weapon, which I believe was a tennis ball or something wrapped in a sock. It hurt, but wasn't rock hard and was not sharp. At the same time, the other kid began pullling much harder on my bag.

I couldn't get the gate open, so after a second, I yelled out loudly Dad! The black kid, now beside his friend, swung at my face, though I lent back and it missed (I assume he wanted to knock my glasses off, or he had shitty aim). The other pulled on my bag once more, then they ran off, turning back onto Pentiland.

Now alone, mostly unharmed and still in possession of my bag, I walked off (Having completely lied about the location of my home). a large part of me wanted to run, but with big clunky boots and a long cape I was worried they would hear me and return. After a block or so I calmed down and looked behind me; no sign of 'em. While walking past Sabroso, I saw a small group of people leaving the club. I'd like to say I warned them about the kids, but I wasn't thinking clearly, and a pair went off towards Pentiland (I really hope they didn't encounter those kids, and seriously regret not warning them).

I'm home now, and have had a chance to check myself. My bag is still closed and everything inside it safe. My neck has a slight red mark though isn't injured, and should be fine tomorrow. Aside from some nerves, I really got out of it all okay, but I wanted to in part warn other locals about them, and also just talk myself through what had happened so I could work out what I did right/wrong. Thanks for reading this if you have. For reference, I am a 20 year old male who would be obviously identified as a nerd, and potentially an easy target (particularily considering the glasses and Syndrome costume.) 

tl;dr: 20 year old male was almost mugged by two young men aged between 15-18 near Seddon station. The muggers did not appear to have a deadly weapon, though that does not mean they don't. They ran off at the potential of a difficult attack, though again, this does not mean they will again in the future.


I kinda want to mention what I think is important here. They asked for the time both to get me to slow down, and to see if I got out a phone. If it is late and someone asks you for the time, do not get out a phone to check, offer them a best guess, and do not stop walking to do so. If they ask you to check, tell them you don't have something to check on. 

When they caught up to me, I still did not stop, though I did not verbally argue with them. When I stopped, I did it because I felt threatened enough by their presence that I was worried I would be attacked for running. Calling for help may have been a bad idea, as those kinds of calls can be easily ignored, both by attackers and potential assistance. By calling for someone who I knew and was apparently nearby, they assumed they would have to fight for what they believed would be a very meagre reward. 

I am very glad I claimed to be near to both my home and my father, but I also feel incredible stupid for gaming them by asking them if their parents knew what they were doing. It was a stupid thing designed only to get me very temporary satisfaction, at the risk of angering them a great deal. Finally, I feel awful for not warning other people in the area of a possible threat against them, allowing them to be prepared should they have encountered the boys. I also do feel somewhat bad for associating myself with a strangers home, and I intend to knock on their door at a resonable hour tomorrow and explain the sitaution, in case those boys decide to damage them home in relatation for my actions.

Sorry for the wall of text; I really just wanted to get this out of my head and spoken somewhere. Have a good night all, and stay safe.",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,False,,,True,t3_14w91y,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/14w91y/attempted_mugging_near_seddon_station_details/,

It's tucked away in an arcade nobody visits on the corner of Elisabeth and Lonsdale, and I've been grinding just about every Saturday shift there since 2008.

Turns out, nobody shops on Saturdays (at least, not in that little arcade) and I spend most of the day bored out of my mind, hacking away at my own epic fantasy novels. Which is a shame, because while our store is pretty small, I think we have a solid range and we're cheaper than just about everyone else in the area (ie, Borders, Dymocks, Collins and Minotaur).

So, hoping to not spend another weekend in an empty store, I chatted to the boss and asked if I could give all redditors a blanket discount on all stock this weekend. Being the rad dude he is, he said yes. So, if you're in the CBD this weekend, please pop in and say hi. You'll make my day (I'll be the only person in the shop) and if you say you're from reddit I can give you 10% off, straight up. And, if what you want isn't in the store, I can order it for you immediately and give you the discount when it arrives, just cos I'm that sort of dude. Also, I'll offer you a venetian, cos these biscuits are goddamn delicious.

In October, I'm premièring a brand spanking new show at Melbourne Fringe.

It's a stand up comedy show about the time I appeared on Today Tonight, meeting Naomi Robson and getting screwed over by the show. 

It's called 'Today Tonight, Tomorrow the World'

I'm having a test run of the show on 28 August at The Brunswick Green and I'd really like to get some complete strangers along to laugh at my jokes or throw puppies if you hate it. (please don't throw puppies. It's not their fault I'm not funny)

https://www.facebook.com/events/412320292137593/

If anyone has any other ideas on how to get some people along to check out some free comedy, let me know.

Thanks. 

PS - You don't HAVE to hate Today Tonight but it helps.

PPS - Ask me anything about myself, Today Tonight or comedy.

A man on board starts having a bit of a seizure. One woman on board pressed the emergency call button while some others made sure he wasn't going to damage himself. I saw a nice woman pick up the dude's phone from the floor and zip it into his jacket pocket.

The call box made phone-ringing sounds for a couple of minutes. It was never answered.

When the train pulled into Richmond, I knocked on the driver's door. He had no idea anyone had pressed anything in his train.

Richmond was my destination, so I don't have much of the rest of the story, except the dude seemed to be recovering (he'd just donated blood it seems) and a nice bloke grabbed him a drink from the Richmond platform machines while I made sure the driver didn't take off.

People might want to bear this in mind if they ever feel they might need to press that emergency button. Seems the drivers can't actually tell if you use it.",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,False,,,True,t3_hp2u6,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/hp2u6/oh_metro_trains/,

YOU ROCK,Ecc1019,59,9,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/nfu5o/a_big_thank_you_to_the_guy_who_retrieved_and/,"On the night of Friday the 16th of December:

Thanks to the lovely guy in a blue and white shirt, on Sydney Rd Brunswick outside the Penny Black who chased me down the street and around the corner (for at least a block and a half!) whilst I was on my bike to return the bag he had retrieved from somebody who had stolen it out of my basket.

I had been out with my friends at the Retreat having a lovely time meeting crazy and colourful people of Brunswick.  A little after 1:00 am we left the Retreat, to discover things were getting a bit messy in the street outside.  Police were wandering around and as places were closing it was all a bit chaotic and crowded.  We went to retrieve our bikes, which were parked next to the Penny Black in front of the bank.  People were milling about everywhere and my friends went ahead (the bastards!  No not really I love them) while I finished unlocking and putting on my helmet and lights.

I got around the corner and some distance away from Sydney Rd when I heard a voice behind me:  ""girl on the bike!  Girl on the bike!  I've got your bag!""  I looked around and sure enough my shoulder bag was missing from the basket on the back of my bike.  A lovely 20-something guy was running after me carrying it.  Returning it, he told me he had seen somebody take it out of the basket, and *people shouldn't do that*.

I was completely taken aback -- I didn't even realise something horrid had happened, and I didn't need to experience it because this wonderful person had gone out of his way, possibly putting himself at risk to do a good deed for a stranger.  In a hurry to catch up with my friends and already flustered by the chaos of closing time on Sydney Rd, I tried to express my thanks but I'm not even sure if words came out.  What an unexpected gift, such an act of kindness from a stranger.  I love Brunswick!

If you read this, please PM me as I owe you a beer!  If anyone knows who this might have been, please tell him about this post .. and if anyone hears someone telling a story about the time they returned a bag to a girl on a bike on Sydney Rd, definitely buy him a beer.

So last week I took a sicky from work. I took a nap in the middle of the day, and a person claiming to be a council worker knocked on our door.

My daughter answered, and the ""council worker"" told her that they had received a noise complaint regarding ""several cats and dogs in the yard"". 

Now, we don't own any pets. My daughter told the ""council worker"" as much, upon which he asked if he could see the yard to verify it. She let him into our house, where he stepped into our kitchen, took a very cursory glance at our yard through the window, and then promptly left.

Now, my daughter was fairly intimidated by the air of authority this guy had, and so completely forgot to ask for ID, but noted that he didn't offer to present any, although he wore a top with the council logo emblazoned on it. She also said that the white van he was driving was parked in such a way that she couldn't see if it was marked with the council logo either, but managed to get the rego.

When I woke up, she explained what happened to me, and I immediately called our council, explained the situation and asked if it was routine to send council workers over for a site visit in response to noise complaints. The operator at the other end was apparently irritated by my question, told me ""No"" and then promptly *hung up on me*.

I then called the cops and told them about what happened, they took down the rego information and the vehicle description, and said they'd get back to me if they found anything. 

So, council workers of /r/melbourne, I'm hoping I can get a second opinion here - I'm under the impression that the man who visited my house was 'casing' it for ways in and the positions of exits, but I'm uncertain as he did not attempt to survey the entire yard, even when he had a decent pretext to. Does this happen often with noise complaints? Is it unheard of for a council worker to conduct site visits for such complaints?

**EDIT**:  I don't really dig the racist / sexist tone this has taken.  I'm not into class-trash.  I'm sorry if I promoted that - I see how it happened as a result of my suggestion.  For our part, the games we play aren't there to make fun of the homeless or drug addicts.  Quite the opposite, really: the amusing part is that rich kids style themselves (at great expense) as if they were down and out.  

Some of the other game suggestions are excellent, though, and I thank you.  You guys rock.

I figure this is a long-shot, but just yesterday i was in the East Brighton area (near the corner of Centre rd and Jasper st) and witnessed a truck sideswipe (and demolish!) a car parked on the side of the road. The truck stopped for a minute, then drove off. I was the only witness, and i believe the truck driver thought noone was around.

I didn't see the side of the truck, or the number plate. 

The truck was yellow, and had a compactor on the back. It was quite scratched up (as i would expect a rubbish truck to be).

I was hoping someone might be able to suggest some waste removal companies that service the area, that also have yellow trucks. So far google has come up with white, blue, green and purple trucks... but no yellow.

Just to be clear; I'm only looking for leads to help the owner of the car with her insurance investigation (she was quite distraught), and am not trying to go on a witch-hunt.

This year I'm booking out a room for us so there'll be no wandering around introducing yourself to strangers and hoping they're redditors, everyone there will be. 

[Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/381518638566546/)

Softbelly is a funky enough little bar with plenty of space for all of us. Drinks are very reasonably priced and it's right in the heart of the CBD so everyone should be able to make it! I chose this venue mostly because it's free and it's only a $200 deposit that I'll get back as long as at least 40 of you show up. I'm confident we'll get 50-60 pretty quickly! There's a bit of room to over-flow in to the front room if a crazy amount of people show up, if there's over 100 RSVP'd I might need to figure something else out!

If you are not over 18, don't worry! I'm helping someone organise a picnic or BBQ sometime during the day as well so you guys can come meet some like-minded people without the extra fun of alcohol. There'll be details on that coming very soon! I won't be able to make that during the day so the planning for this and that will be separate but very well co-ordinated. If you are of drinking age and don't have a bedtime, you can still attend (there might be some sunlight, so gradually expose yourself to it. We suggest leaving your parents basement for a few minutes each day to build a tolerance.)

I'll update this post with more specifics (i.e. a map, facebook event, a time and anything else needed) a bit closer to the date, but for now mark your calendars!

What's the difference between this party and every other party ever held? You're actually invited! Unfortunately, this is a real life event that you must physically attend. Leave the warmth of your computer screen in that dark room, shave off your neck beard, and prepare yourself for IRL convos. Members of the female gender will be in attendance, so if you encounter one, don't make any sudden movements, don't raise your voice above a whisper and above all else, DON'T PANIC. (Helpful hint: They like shiny things and equality)

Alternatively you could just skip this event, sit at home alone, and then throw yourself a one-person pity party when you realised what a magnificent time was had without you. It's totally up to you. It's not like your cat will judge you or anything. (Karma if it does, amirite?)

Illegal? no), but then passed me the remaining $60 in mixed real and counterfeit notes. Before this I had never seen a counterfeit note - ther were some real ones, but then, sandwiched in-between there were these ones that were smaller than normal notes and off colour. Almost blue / green? Three of us checked them before we were unanimous that they weren't real, at which point we held the money and called the police. 

As I said before, the customer was sketchy - he was acted like he didn't understand what was going on - he was eastern european in accent - but then asked for 'the real money back' in very clear english. After he realised we weren't joking about the polce, infact I was on the phone, he legged it. 

Police interviewed us, took the money for evidence and testing. End of story.

Details will follow soon once I begin to get an idea of numbers.

Whose game and full of festive cheer?

&lt;edit&gt; Cool, this is shaping up to be a nice little shindig, I'll start seeking a venue.

&lt;edit 2&gt; Okay looks like there is enough interest to make it worthwhile, I won't keep replying to everyone individually but as soon as I get things together I'll msg everyone en masse.

&lt;edit 3&gt; Okay the plan is coming together, I'll try and make sure I msg everybody but here's the details just in case.
 
Reddit (Melbourne) Christmas/Hanukkah/Kwanza/Festivus Party!

WHEN:		Saturday 11th December 7pm

WHERE:		The Spaghetti Tree
                        59 Bourke Street
                        Melbourne VIC 3000

THE VENUE IS: 	Easily accessible by public transport with trams      
                        running down Bourke St, and is only metres away 
                        from Parliament Station.

                        Cheap and cheerful -  I’d advise you to bring cash 
                        to cover the tab as given our numbers they 
                        probably won’t bill split.

RSVP:		Preferably prior to 3/12/2010
                        via Reddit @ judy-lee
                        I’ll send a confirmation before the night.

             Hope to see you all there with (Jingle) Bells on.

&lt;Edit 4&gt; Hi Guys, I've had such a positive response, wow! Looking forward to seeing you all in person. I'll keep you updated as we get nearer. Cheers.

&lt;Edit 5&gt; I need to let the venue know firm numbers by FRIDAY 3rd!! Let me know if your interested. Confirmations will start going out on Friday. ",,False,self,t5_2qkhb,True,,,True,t3_e2vtk,http://www.reddit.com/r/melbourne/comments/e2vtk/melbourne_redditors_christmas_party/,

One kind Redditor suggest that I call the Ombudsman's Office, which I did, and that same day someone came out to turn me gas back on.

Late last week, I got another call from them. This incredibly nice lady explained that she was handling my complaint and had already spoken to TRUEnergy on my behalf. In short, they admit they had improperly shut off my gas and had are now being forced to pay me nearly $1,400 as part of the standard fine for such misdeeds.

With that money, I've asked them to settle my balances for both gas and electricity, and send me the remainder.

**TL;DR - If you've been improperly shut off, call the Ombudsman's Office. They are awesome and helped me tremendously.**

I'm Miss FromTheBeyond, a Melbournian who is developing an idea that could be the next thing to lighten up Melbourne's cold winter nights - a sci-fi and fantasy film festival - but more than just a festival of films - a series of amazing experiences!

Currently I am undertaking some market research for this festival, and your input is essential! If you can spare 2 minutes to answer 10 multiple questions, it would help me to understand what the audience wants so this festival can be truly grand!  

I am looking for a wide range of data. The more input I get, the more amazing the event will be - so check out the survey [here](http://kwiksurveys.com/s.asp?sid=fnnpjg2am2143wy195729) and be sure to send it to family, friends, colleagues, the homeless and anyone else who might be interested in attending.

There's a website on the way with more information very soon - so watch this space! 

Many thanks, much love and appreciation to you all!
